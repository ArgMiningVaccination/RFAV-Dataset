[Dieting](/wiki/Dieting) is the practice of attempting to achieve or maintain a certain weight through diet. [[1]](#cite_note-1) People's dietary choices are often affected by a variety of factors, including ethical and religious beliefs, clinical need, or a desire to control weight. Not all diets are considered healthy. Some people follow unhealthy diets through habit, rather than through a conscious choice to eat unhealthily. Terms applied to such eating habits include \"junk food diet\" and \"Western diet\". Many diets are considered by clinicians to pose significant health risks and minimal long-term benefit. This is particularly true of \"crash\" or \"fad\" diets - short-term, weight-loss plans that involve drastic changes to a person's normal eating habits. Only diets covered on Wikipedia are listed under alphabetically sorted headings. Belief-based diets Some people's dietary choices are influenced by their religious, spiritual or philosophical beliefs. [Buddhist diet](/wiki/Buddhist_cuisine): While [Buddhism](/wiki/Buddhism)does not have specific dietary rules, some Buddhists practice [vegetarianism](/wiki/Buddhist_vegetarianism)based on Mahayana Buddhism's strict interpretation of the first of the [Five Precepts](/wiki/Five_Precepts). [[2]](#cite_note-2) [Hindu diet](/wiki/Diet_in_Hinduism): It is popular for followers of Hinduism to follow [lacto vegetarian diets](/wiki/Lacto_vegetarianism)(though most do not), based on the principle of [ahimsa](/wiki/Ahimsa)(non-harming). [[3]](#cite_note-hindudiet-3)Consuming [beef/cattle](/wiki/Beef)is forbidden or at least taboo among followers due to [cow veneration](/wiki/Cattle_in_religion_and_mythology). Most Hindus in India do intentionally limit their meat consumption one way or another. [[4]](#cite_note-:0-4) [Jain diet](/wiki/Jain_vegetarianism): Due to how the Jain faith interprets [vegetarianism](/wiki/Vegetarianism)is considered mandatory for followers; a lacto-vegetarian diet [[5]](#cite_note-5)or vegan diet [[6]](#cite_note-6)in particular is considered appropriate for Jains. Most Jains also abstain from consuming root vegetables in order to prevent harming insects, worms and microorganisms when they are uprooted. Most also partake in [some form of fasting](/wiki/Fasting_in_Jainism). [[4]](#cite_note-:0-4)Some variants of Jainism further discourage or forbid the consumption of honey, fungi, alcoholic beverages and fermented foods. [Islamic diet](/wiki/Islamic_dietary_laws): Muslims follow a diet consisting solely of food that is [halal](/wiki/Halal)- permissible in Islam. The opposite of halal is [haraam](/wiki/Haraam), food that is Islamically Impermissible. Haraam substances include alcohol, carnivores, pork and other non-ruminant animals, and any meat from an animal which was not killed through the Islamic method of ritual slaughter ( [Dhabiha](/wiki/Dhabiha)). [[7]](#cite_note-7)If an otherwise Halal animal was subject to torture by humans, its meat can still be considered non-permissible for Muslims. [I-tal](/wiki/I-tal): A set of principles which influences the diet of many members of the [Rastafari movement](/wiki/Rastafari_movement). One principle is that natural foods should be consumed. Emphasis is put on consuming produce that is fresh, organic and ideally grown at home or locally. Another principle involves avoiding \"unclean\" types of food; the definition which is influenced by Biblical teachings. In order to preserve \"life energy\" Rastafarians encourage [teetotalism](/wiki/Teetotalism), and many Rastafarians interpret I-tal to advocate vegetarianism or veganism as well. [[8]](#cite_note-8)Many followers do view seafood as an acceptable addition to an I-tal diet but they restrict which kinds they permit; fish over a foot long are typically avoided and all shellfish are eschewed as they are not Kosher animals\u2014unlike [finned-fish](/wiki/Actinopterygii)with scales. [Kosher diet](/wiki/Kosher_foods): Food permissible under [Kashrut](/wiki/Kashrut), the set of [Jewish](/wiki/Jewish)dietary laws, is said to be Kosher. Some foods and food combinations are non-Kosher, and failure to prepare food in accordance with Kashrut can make otherwise permissible foods non-Kosher. [[9]](#cite_note-9) [Seventh-day Adventist diet](/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church#Health_and_diet): Combines the [Kosher food](/wiki/Kosher_foods)rules of Judaism with prohibitions against alcoholic beverages and (sometimes) caffeinated beverages. There is emphasis on consuming whole foods. Meat-consumption is heavily discouraged but not necessarily disallowed; about half of Adventists are [lacto-ovo-vegetarians](/wiki/Lacto-ovo_vegetarianism). [[10]](#cite_note-10) [Vegan](/wiki/Veganism#Vegan_diets,_substitutions,_and_meat_analogues)and [pescetarian](/wiki/Pescetarianism)diets are also more popular among Adventists compared to the general public [[11]](#cite_note-11)but other Adventists are still willing to eat Kosher meats. [Word of Wisdom](/wiki/Word_of_Wisdom)diet: The name of a section of the [Doctrine and Covenants](/wiki/Doctrine_and_Covenants), a book of scripture accepted by members of [the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints). Dietary advice includes (1) wholesome plants \"in the season thereof\", (2) eating meat sparingly and only \"in times of winter, or of cold, or famine\", and (3) grain as the \"staff of life\". [[12]](#cite_note-12)Unlike injunctions against tobacco, alcohol, coffee and tea\u2014compliance with meat-avoidance has always remained optional among [the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints)and emphasis on refraining from meat has largely been dropped. [[13]](#cite_note-Alexander-13)An official church publication states, \"modern methods of refrigeration now make it possible to preserve meat in any season\". [[14]](#cite_note-14) - Remba/Lemba diet: [Lemba people](/wiki/Lemba_people)or Remba people are found in Southern Africa and their diet is based on their culture. Their day includes meats and carbohydrates but the meat is slaughtered in a specific way so as to drain maximum blood from the animal. They pay particular attention to cleanliness of the person handling and preparing as well as the utensils used for food. Their diet excludes pork. Calorie and weight control diets A desire to lose weight is a common motivation to change dietary habits, as is a desire to maintain an existing weight. Many weight loss diets are considered by some to entail varying degrees of health risk, and some are not widely considered to be effective. This is especially true of \"crash\" or \"fad\" diets. [[15]](#cite_note-15) Many of the diets listed below could fall into more than one subcategory. Where this is the case, it is noted in that diet's entry. Low-calorie diets [5:2 diet](/wiki/5:2_diet): fasting](/wiki/Intermittent_fasting): fasting restriction](/wiki/Calorie_restriction).

The book suggests that the key to reaching and maintaining the desired weight is understanding and carefully monitoring calories consumed and used. [Nutrisystem](/wiki/Nutrisystem)diet: The dietary element of the weight-loss plan from Nutrisystem, Inc. Nutrisystem distributes low-calorie meals, with specific ratios of fats, proteins and carbohydrates. [[19]](#cite_note-19) [Weight Watchers diet](/wiki/Weight_Watchers_(diet)): Foods are assigned point values; dieters can eat any food with a point value provided they stay within their daily point limit. [[20]](#cite_note-20) Very low calorie diets A [very low calorie diet](/wiki/Very_low_calorie_diet) is consuming fewer than 800 calories per day. Such diets are normally followed under the supervision of a doctor. [[21]](#cite_note-21) Zero-calorie diets are also included. [Inedia](/wiki/Inedia)(breatharian diet): A diet in which no food is consumed, based on the belief that [prana](/wiki/Prana)but not food is necessary for human subsistence. [[22]](#cite_note-22) [KE diet](/wiki/KE_diet)(feeding tube diet): A diet in which an individual feeds through a [feeding tube](/wiki/Feeding_tube)and does not eat anything. [[23]](#cite_note-23) [The Last Chance diet](/wiki/The_Last_Chance_Diet): General premise is that the [dieter](/wiki/Dieting)will consume only one low-calorie high protein beverage daily. This equated to no more than 400 calories per day.

Low-carbohydrate diets [Atkins diet](/wiki/Atkins_Nutritional_Approach): A low-carbohydrate the late-20th and early-21st centuries. [[26]](#cite_note-26)Proponents argue that this approach is a more successful way of losing weight than low-calorie diets; [[27]](#cite_note-27)critics argue that a low-carb approach poses increased health risks. [[28]](#cite_note-28)The Atkins diet consists of four phases (Induction, Balancing, Fine-Tuning and Maintenance) with a gradual increase in consumption of carbohydrates as the person goes through the phases. [[29]](#cite_note-29) [Dukan Diet](/wiki/Dukan_Diet): A multi-step diet based on high protein and limited carbohydrate consumption. It starts with two steps intended to facilitate short term weight loss, followed by two steps intended to consolidate these losses and return to a more balanced long-term diet. [[30]](#cite_note-30) [Kimkins](/wiki/Kimkins): A heavily promoted diet for weight loss, found to be fraudulent. [South Beach Diet](/wiki/South_Beach_Diet): Diet developed by the Miami-based cardiologist Arthur Agatston, who says that the key to losing weight quickly and getting healthy is not cutting all carbohydrates and fats from the diet, but choosing the right carbs and the right fats. [[31]](#cite_note-31) [Stillman diet](/wiki/Stillman_diet): A carbohydrate-restricted diet that predates the Atkins diet, allowing consumption of specific food ingredients. Low-fat diets - McDougall's starch diet is a high calorie, high fiber, low fat diet that is based on starches such as potatoes, rice, and beans which excludes all animal foods and added vegetable oils. [John A. McDougall](/wiki/John_A._McDougall)draws on historical observation of how many civilizations around the world throughout time have thrived on starch foods. Crash diets [Crash diets](/wiki/Crash_diet) are [very-low-calorie diets](/wiki/Very-low-calorie_diet) used fast [weight loss](/wiki/Weight_loss). [[32]](#cite_note-32) [[33]](#cite_note-33) [[34]](#cite_note-34) They describe diet plans that involve making extreme, rapid changes to food consumption, but are also used as disparaging terms for common eating habits which are considered unhealthy. This diet is dangerous and can lead to sudden death when not done in a medically supervised setting. [[35]](#cite_note-Isner1979-35) [[36]](#cite_note-Sours1981-36) Several diets listed here are weight-loss diets which would also fit into other sections of this list. Where this is the case, it will be noted in that diet's entry. [Beverly Hills Diet](/wiki/Beverly_Hills_Diet): An extreme diet which has only fruits in the first days, gradually increasing the selection of foods up to the sixth week.

[[40]](#cite_note-guardiansubway-40) Detox diets [Detox diets](/wiki/Detox_diet) involve either not consuming or attempting to flush out substances that are considered unhelpful or harmful. Examples include restricting food consumption to foods without colorings or preservatives, taking supplements, or drinking large amounts of water. The latter practice in particular has drawn criticism, as drinking significantly more water than recommended levels can cause [hyponatremia](/wiki/Hyponatremia). [[41]](#cite_note-41) There is no scientific evidence of any benefit from detox diets, and so they are considered to be [pseudoscientific](/wiki/Pseudoscientific). [[42]](#cite_note-42) [[43]](#cite_note-43) [Juice fasting](/wiki/Juice_fasting): A form of detox diet, in which nutrition is obtained solely from fruit and vegetable juices. The health implications of such diets are disputed. [[44]](#cite_note-44) [Master Cleanse](/wiki/Master_Cleanse): A modified juice fast that substitutes tea and lemonade for food. Diets followed for medical reasons People's dietary choices are sometimes affected by [intolerance](/wiki/Food_intolerance) or [allergy](/wiki/Food_allergy) to certain types of food.

[[53]](#cite_note-53) - Healthy kidney diet: This diet is for those impacted with chronic kidney disease, those with only one kidney, those who have a kidney infection and those who may be suffering from some other kidney failure. [[54]](#cite_note-Nutrition-54)This diet is not the dialysis diet, [[55]](#cite_note-55)which is completely different. The healthy kidney diet restricts large amounts of protein, which are hard for the kidney to break down, but especially limits potassium and phosphorus-rich foods and beverages. Liquid intake is often limited as well. [[54]](#cite_note-Nutrition-54) [[56]](#cite_note-56) [Ketogenic diet](/wiki/Ketogenic_diet): A high-fat, low-carb diet, in which dietary and body fat is converted into energy.

[[60]](#cite_note-brown-60) Fad diets A [fad diet](/wiki/Fad_diet) is a [diet](/wiki/Dieting) that is popular for a time, similar to [fads](/wiki/Fad) in fashion, without being a standard dietary recommendation, and often promising unreasonably fast weight loss or nonsensical health improvements. [[61]](#cite_note-Hart2018-61) [[62]](#cite_note-Hanky2017-62) [[63]](#cite_note-bda-63) [[64]](#cite_note-Oxford2013-64) [[65]](#cite_note-Zoumbaris2014-65) There is no single definition of what a fad diet is, encompassing a variety of diets with different approaches and evidence bases, and thus different outcomes, advantages and disadvantages, [[62]](#cite_note-Hanky2017-62) and it is ever-changing. [[61]](#cite_note-Hart2018-61) [[62]](#cite_note-Hanky2017-62) Generally, fad diets promise short-term changes with little efforts, and thus may lack educating consumers about whole-diet, whole lifestyle changes necessary for sustainable health benefices. [[61]](#cite_note-Hart2018-61) [[62]](#cite_note-Hanky2017-62) [[66]](#cite_note-Williams2013-66) [[67]](#cite_note-Shick1998-67) Fad diets are often promoted with exaggerated claims, such as rapid [weight loss](/wiki/Weight_loss) of more than 1 kg/week or improving health by \"detoxification\", or even dangerous claims. [[62]](#cite_note-Hanky2017-62) [[63]](#cite_note-bda-63) [[68]](#cite_note-phn-68) [[69]](#cite_note-katz-69) Since the \"fad\" qualification varies over time, social, cultural and subjective view, this list cannot be exhaustive, [[61]](#cite_note-Hart2018-61) and fad diets may continue or stop being fads, such as the [mediterranean diet](/wiki/Mediterranean_diet). [[70]](#cite_note-BrownIsaacs2010-70) Some of them have therapeutic indications, such as epilepsy or obesity, [[71]](#cite_note-EatrightKeto-71) [[72]](#cite_note-USGuidelines2013-72) and there is no one-size-fits-all diet that would be a panacea for everyone to lose weight or look better.
