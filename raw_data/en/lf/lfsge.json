COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS The u.S. Commission on civil Rights is a temporary, independent, bipartisan agency established by Congress in 1957 and directed to: Investigate complaints alleging that citizens are being deprived of their right to vote by reason of their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, or by reason of fraudulent practices; study and collect information concerning legal developments constituting a denial of equal protection of the laws under the Constitution because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, or in the administration of justice; Appraise Federal laws and policies with respect to the denial of equal protection of the laws because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, or in the administration of justice; Serve as a national clearinghouse for information in respect to denials of equal protection of the laws because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; Submit reports, findings, and recommendations to the President and the Congress. MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION Arthur S. Flemming, Chairman stephen Horn, Vice Chairman Frankie M. Freeman Manuel Ruiz, Jr. Murray Saltzman Louis Nunez, Acting Staff Director TOWARD EQUAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY: AFFIRMATIVE ADMISSIONS PROGRAMS AT LAW AND MEDICAL SCHOOLS U.S. Commission on Civil Rights Clearinghouse Publication 55 June 1978 ~ .... .\\ JUL 271978 PREFACE This Nation holds an enduring belief in the capacity of education to shape both our personal and national futures. This is evident in the Supreme Court's decision in 1954 in Brown v. Boa;d of Education,1 which stressed that where education is provided it must be provided equally to all. That decision gave hope to many minority Americans that they might at last enjoy the educational opportunities taken for granted by many or most of their fellow ci'tizens. This Nation's commitment to remedying the effects of the discrimination held unconstitutional in Br~ and related cases is cast in doubt by the growing controversy over affirmative admissions programs in professional schools. specifically, affirmative student admissions policies and practices 2 at law and medical schools have been challenged on legal grounds as unconstitutional \"reverse discrimination\" and on educational policy grounds as replacing the merit standard in admissions decisicms.. The debate involves such questions as whether \"racially sensitive\" programs undertaken voluntarily by professional schools are iii consistent with the law; whether unqualified minority students are being given preference in admissions O~ler qualified white students, thus viola\u00b7ting merit standards for admission; and whetheI: such programs; are in fact necessary to increase minOJrity enrollment. in law and medical schools and partici.pation in those professions. These and other related issues have been discussed at length in recent years. More t:han 60 legal briefs have been presented to the Suprem(= court of the United states in connection with the Bak~e case. 3 The Commission's concern about remedying discrimination in higher education is not of recent origin. In 1960, the commission released a major study entitled Egual Protection of ~he Laws in Public HigQ~f Education. The Commission addressed the issue of affirmative action in employment at universities in a 1973 report, ~tement QD. Affirmative Action for \u00a7gu~! Employment Opportunities. In 1975, the Commission held a consultation on \"Affirmative Action in Employment in Higher Education. II In 1977, the Commission released a \u00a3tatement ~ Af~!rmative Action, which considered, among other issues, affirmative admissions programs.~ iv , 1 I 1 1 t 1 , .~ 1 J J j f I I This monograph examines affirmative admissions programs at law and medical schools in the context of our national commitments to equal opportunity and to the eradication of the remaining effects of discrimination. The study traces the history of past discrimination in education, particularly higher education, and describes some of its continuing effects, including the underrepresentation of minorities in the legal and medical professions. Next, the traditional admissions process at law and medical schools is examined with respect to both its numerical, objective, or quantitative standards and its subjective or nonquantitative criteria. Affirmative admissions programs currently in operation are then described and analyzed in the context of past discrimination and their l:'elationship to traditional admissions programs. Commission staff have reviewed relevant literature, including many of the briefs submitted in connection with the Bak~~ case, and have interviewed admissions officers and other key individuals at selected law and medical sc-hools.5 The schools visited were chosen because they use different approaches to increase minority enrollment, have different minority groups represented in their enrollments, and are v located in diverse regions of the united states. 6 While these schools employ different approaches to the same basic concern--underrepresentation of minorities in law and medicine--they do not represent, nor were they intended to represent, a scientific random samplec This monograph does not discuss issues of student recruitment or retention, nor is sex discrimfnation treated. 7 Furthermore, this study does not purport to be a legal brief. As previously noted, the commission has discussed the legal and policy context for affirmative admissions programs in its statem~ 2n Affirmative Action released in october 1977. That j statement notes that the explicit use of race in the design of remedial measures is not unique to admissions programs in professional schools, or even in the field of education generally, and that such measures have been adopted and upheld in other contexts, most notably employment. 8 The statement further explains why the commission considers the setting of affirmative action goals, including the use of numerically based, racially sensitive remedies for past discrimination, to be in the national interest. This monograph reviews the problems that gave rise to the need for affirmative admissions programs and vi ~ 1 I 1 1 i l , I ( looks at the nature and effect of such programs in comparison to traditional admissions programs. The Commission hopes that by synthesizing some of the material on these matters and focusing on several basic issues, it will contribute to a better understanding of the nature and role of affirmative admissions programs at our law and medical schools. vii Notes To Preface 1. 347 u.s. 483 (1954). 2. As used in this monograph, \"affirmative admissions\" refers to various admissions programs at schools of law and medicine in which minority status is considered along with undergraduate grade point averages, entrance test scores, and other traditional criteria in determining which applicants will be admitted to study. 3..

THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT Americans have always recognized the importance of education to our democratic society. Thomas Jefferson stressed the paramount need for an educated people if the American democratic experiment were to succeed, and he drafted a law to establish public education in the colonies .. 1 Two hundred years later, Lynd:;:.n B. Johnson also noted the importance of an education for all citizens when he declared, \"Education, more than any single force, will mold the citizen of the future. That citizen, in turn, will readily db~ermine the greatness of our society. \"2 FOr most of this Nation's history, however, minority groups were denied the same educational opportunities afforded whites. Ignorance and fear of, and in some cases contempt for, racial and ethnic minorities were the basis for the assumption among many whites that a good education for minorities was either undesirable or unnecessary. In the case of blacks, for example, the education of slaves was a prospect that for generations filled many whites with 'deep fear. Education, in their view, 1 ~ould bring not progress and hope but, instead, demands for freedom. In 1832, one member of the Virginia House of Delegates spoke with relief of the black anti literacy laws passed in the South: We have, as far as possible, closed every avenue by which light might enter ~heir [the slaves' ] minds. If we could extinguish the capacity to see the light, our work would be completed; they would then be on a level with the beasts of the field, and we should be safe! 3 The fear of black literacy was so strong in the 18th and early 19th centuries that, with the exception of Kentucky, Maryland, and Tennessee, the teaching of slaves was barred throughout the south.4 Eventually, prohibitions against learning were applied even to freed slaves. 5 In the North, efforts of blacks and whites to maintain schools for freed blacks were often met by arson, angry mobs, and intimidation. 6 Discrimination against other minority groups in the early part of this century is typified in the views expressed by a county school superintendent in Texas: Most of our Mexicans are of the lower class. They transplant onions, harvest them, etc. The less they know about everything else, the better contented they are. You have doubtless heard that ignorance is bliss; it seems that it is so when one has to transplant onions lf a man has very much sense or education either, he is not going to stick to this kind of work. So you see it is 2 . 1 up to the white population to keep the Mexican on his knees in an onion patch This does not mix well with education. 7 The middle years of the 19th century saw the end of slavery, the Reconstruction period, and the ratification of treaties governing relationships between the u.s. Government and peoples in the conquered territories, i.e., Mexican Americans and American Indians. During Reconstruction, a'time of great hope and promise for many blacks, the Federal Government, concerned whites, and blacks from the North and South undertook the task of providing schools for the former slaves ~ho had been forcibly kept illiterate. The Ku Klux Klan and other hostile whites, however, perpetrated widespread violence designed to destroy these efforts.8 One writer describes the Klan's sustained violence in the south at this time ?s unequaled. 9 Violence and intimidation became less necessary as whites regained political control of the South, imposed Jim Crow laws and Jim Crow justice on blacks, and acted to disfranchise them.IO The imposition of \"separate but equal\" education came as a final, telling blow to black development. 11 3 If SEPARATE BUT EQUAL\" A brief examination of public elementary and secondary schooling during the first half of the 20th century is informative as to the then-prevailing attitudes toward minority education. In 1896, the Supreme Court of the United States in ~les~ v. Ferguson, a transportation case, upheld the constitutionality of the separate but equal doctrine, providing the legal basis for the approval of the systems of segregated education which had e'.Jolved. 12 In 1899, the Court ruled in Cumming v. Richmond County Board of EducatiQg that educational policies of public schools at the local level are the responsibility of the states, and interference by the Federal Government is not justified, except in the case of a \"clear and unmistakable disregard of rights secured by the supreme law of the land.\" Unequal expenditures, when within the discretion of the school board, were not found to violate the Constitution so long as, it was suggested, they were not prompted by hostility to the black population because of its race. 13 \"separate but equal\" public school systems were thus sanctioned by the Supreme Court of the United States. separate schools were maintained for whites 4 and for all minority groups. While they were in fact separate or segregated according to race or ethnicity, they were seldom, if ever, equal, as black experience in the South revealed. state and local control of the public schooling of black children in the South was a continuing disaster: for example, between 1901 and 1915 in Virginia, 95 percent of school-age white children were assured seats in white SCh00ls while black schools had enough seats for only half of the black children.'. The South lagged behind the rest of the country in all expenditures for education,15 but the separate schools attended by biacks in the South were far worse than the schools attended by whites. 16 Black children in the south were hampered by other disadvantages which prevented them from learning. Black students, due to their parents' precarious economic poSition, were regularly out of classes for crop work, particularly at harvest time.1? Black schools ~ere smaller, which typically led to overcrowding and learning in shifts, an exhausting task for teachers.'o Black teachers generally were paid less than whites (e.g., half as much in Georgia), and black women who taught generally were paid less than any other teachers. 19 Expenditures for books, supplies, and 5 facilities for blacks were markedly lower than similar funding for whites. 20 Mexican Americans in the southwest and west suffered a similar fate. Huge tracts of lan.d in the southwest and west were annexed by this country through conquest, treaties, and purchases. 21 The thousands of Mexican Americans living in the captured area received recognition of their citizenship, property, religion, and liberty rights in 1848 under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. In New l~exico\" article XII, section 10 of the state constitution guaranteed: Children of spanilsh descent in the state of New Mexico shall never be denied the right and privilege of ,admission and attendance in the public schools or other public educational institutions of the state, and they shall never be classed in separate schools, but shall forever enjoy perfect equality with other children in all public schools and educational institutions of the state. 22 However, such guarantees were of little protection to a people viewed as alien by the Anglo (white) Americans who controlled the annexed territory. Throughout the Southwest and West, Mexican Americans lost aontrol of the education of their children and the language in which teaching would take place. In New Mexico, Anglo control of the State government delayed 6 4 ! 1 the establishment of public schools, kept public education badly underfunded, and finally led to an administrative ruling that English was to be the sole language of public instruction. 23 Funding was \"diverted from the common schools to higher education and, therefore, to the use of Anglos.u24 As was the case \"'7ith blacks, separate schools, discriminatory funding g and shorter school terms made education an empty promise for Mexican Americans in many communities. Their language and customs were regularly ignored, mocked, or even prohibited in Anglo\u00ad controlled schools. 25 Mexican Americans received a second-rate education which left large numbers of students no alternative to the manual labor that had been the lot of their parents. 26 American Indians also found themselves in separate, unequal schools. Treaties made by various American Indian tribes with the United states Government prior to the Civil War included arrangements that the Government provide teachers, supplies, schools, and funds through trust accounts for land purchased. 27 These early treaties were rarely fulfilled. 28 Schools were mostly conducted by white 7 missionaries whose real aim was to convert the Indians to Christianity.29 After the Civil War, the united states established treaties that required for the most part the use of English as the language of instruction for Indian children. 3o Thus, through education the government sought to \"civilize\" the Indian by replacing Indian language and culture with white ways and speech. 31 Not only were American Indian languages forbidden in the schools, but contempt and even hatred was taught for the traditional Indian ways.32 Many Indian children were forced to live in boarding schools at considerable distances from their families. These boarding schools, originally conceived as educationally beneficial, soon came to represent a violent method of inducting American Indians into white society.33 One author notes that coercion, kidnapping, and the withholding of parents' rations were \"customary\" means of forcing Indian children into such schools well into thi~ century.34 In 1934 Congress passed the Johnson-O'Malley Act,35 which empowered the secretary of the Interior to contract with the States and territories to make use of funds appropriated by Congress for Indian education. 8 states and localities regularly frustrated the act's provisions, however, by diverting funds earmarked for Indian schooling to the general educational fund.36 hS a result, American Indian children also continued to face substandard education. 37 Other minority groups, including Asian Americans and Puerto Ricans, arrived on the North American continent in growing numbers during the latter half of tht-: 19th century and into the 20th century, bringing with them hopes for new opportunities and a brighter future for themselves and their children. Instead, they found themselves ensnared in the same web of racial hostility and inferior educational facilities that blacks, Mexican Americans, and American Indians were forced to endure. In 1885, California adopted a school segregation law allowing the exclusion of Chinese and Monogolian children from white public schools. 38 The San Francisco School Board in 1906 directed that all Chinese, Japanese, and Korean students be banned from white city schools and instead be sent to the Oriental Public School. 39 In 1927, in a suit brought by a Chinese student to gain admission to a white school in Mississippi, the United States Supreme Court upheld a 9 Mississippi state Supreme Court ruling that it was not a denial of equal p.,.\"')tection to maintain separate but equal facilitiesG AS a result, separate schools were maintained; white children were sent to one, and all other children to the other.~o Legislation specifically aimed at limiting immigration of Asian and Pacific Island peoples was enacted.~l The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which suspended the immigration of Chinese laborers, was the first exclusively racial immigration law in United states history.~2 The Chinese were denied full eligibility for citizenship in the United states until 1943; the Pilipinos until 1946; and Japanese-born residents until 1952.~3 Reminiscent of the Klants activities against blacks in the south, there were large, hostile, anti-Asian movements throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s.~~ Asians, along with other immigrants, were the subjects of specially assessed taxes in California. 45 Asian immigrants were not permitted to become citizens or to vote and under alien land laws were effectively forbidden from owning or leasing real property.~6 No account of the discrimination directed against Asian Americans can be 10 j I ~ , 1 ~ complete without noting the wholesale internment of Japanese-Americans during the Second World War 7 More recently, a court case in San Francisco documented the serious problems of racial segregation and discrimination encountered by Asian and other minority students~48 In 1974, the Supreme Court in ~~ v. Nichols 49 ruled tbat. under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,50 affirmative steps must be taken by school districts to meet the special language needs of Chinese and other non-English-speaking students in school. The combination of color and culture, including language, has also been a major obstacle to equal educational opportunity for Puerto Rican students. Although Puerto Ricans, unlike Asian Americans, arrived on the' united states mainland as united states citizens, primarily in the 20th century, little effort was made to aid their adjus'tment to mainland public schools. 51 Negative counseling of minority students has been another form of discrimination. For example, blacks in North and south were deliberately counseled for careers below their abili ty. 52 Such advice was :coutinely directed at other minority group students as well.53 11 They were often told that it was pointless for them to seek advanced education since the curriculum would be too difficult for them.54 The outcome of these patterns of isolation, exclusion, and indifference has been severe for minority young people. They have had fewer years of completed schooling than whites or Anglos, higher dropuat rates, higher levels of functional illiteracy, and a significant underrepresentation in institutions of higher education. 55 HIGHER EDUCATION Similar racial segregation and discrimL~aticn faced minority young people who had managed against difficult odds to complete school ana who sought higher education. The Morrill Act56 passed by Congress in 1890 permitted \"separate but equal\" higher education, but the agricultural and mechanical colleges and normal schools that were eventually established for blacks in the South were generally marked by \"meager financial supportlt and inadequate facilitie~ and staffing. 57 Financial leverage by State legislatures and philanthropic backers discouraged the black, primarily vocational, schools from challenging academically the 12 second-class employment status that their students longed to escape. 58 The mockery of nseparate but equa1tt colleges and universities in the south was further demonstrated by the fact that, as one author notes, \"In Texas, the cpnstitution of 1876 pledged to establish a state university for blacks 'when practicable.' seventy years later, the pledge was still unredeemed .. \"59 The experience of blacks in higher education in the North was only slightl~l better. A small number of private white colleges admitted a few black students prior to the Civil War. Berea college in Kentucky, a Border state, opened in 1858 withont racial bias. Oberlin and Antioch colleges in ohio and New York Central college admi'tted some black youths. Furthermore, three institutions of higher education-\u00ad Avery college and Ashmun Collegiate Institu~e (later Lincoln University) in Pennsylvania and Wilberforce University in Ohio--were established for blacks. 6o Elsewhere in the North, however, the admission of blacks and other minority students to university studies was restricted or totally banned: Between 1876 and 1900, some 13 blacks a year graduated from northern colleges or universities, one third from Oberlin (Ohio] 13 alone. While racial restrictions appeared even at Oberlin during these years, at other schools outxight exclusion was the rule. Amherst College's President advised blacks against attending a northern college (because of social disadvantage] princeton continued to turn away all black applicants; Vassar strongly advised blacks not to come 61 Other universities restricting or barring bla~k admiss~ons included Rutgers, Columbia, the University of chicago~ Northwestern, Butler, Colgate-Rochester Divinity, and (as late as 1931) Holy c~:oss and Notre Dame. 62 In 1932, only 2,538 black students were enrolled in northern universities, and \"[o]nce enrolled in college, blacks were sometimes excluded from specific curricula, especially from medicine. 1163 In the 1930s, two legal challenges--Murray v. Qniversity of Maryland 6 and Missouri ~ reI. Gaines v. Canada 65--provided that white publicly supported higher education institutions were obligat~d to admit black students where separate facilities were not otherwise provided for them by the state. Following the second World War (and again after U.s. involvement in Korea and Viet Nam), veterans' benefits provisions contained in economic readjustment legislation, popularly kno\\\\'Yl as the \"GI Bill, \"66 made possible financial assistance by which a large number 14 of veterans could attend college. This enabled many blacks and other minority and poor youth to take advantage of a higher education. 67 While these programs provided the financial wherewithal to attend college, they did not open doors to those colleges and universities or the graduate and professional schools which barred or restricted admission of minority students. In 1950, two decisions of the Supreme Court68 (Sweatt v. Painte~ and McLaurin v. Oklahoma stat~ Rege~) sounded the death knell for segregation in State-supported professional schools. Texas had gone so far as to establish a separate law school for minorities when Sweatt had petitioned in 1946 for admission to the University of Texas Law School at Austin. The University of Oklahoma Graduate School, while admitting McLaurin, forced him to sit in a seat designated for l1colored\" students. 69 The Supreme court found both actions unconstitutional as unequal and ordered the students admitted to their respective state universities. 70 The Civil Rights Act of 1964, with its Title VI provi~ions prohibiting the granting of Federal funds to institutions that discriminate,71 enabled HEW's Office 15 of civil Rights in 1969-1970 to notify 10 states-- Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississi~pi, North carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Virginia--that they were operating segregated systems of higher education and stood in danger of losing Federal grants. 72 MINORITIES IN MEDICINE AND LAW As the institutional practices that have denied minority Americans equal education took form, the United states was developing into a highly industrialized society with a substantial well-educated and professional class. An undergraduate degree assumed steadily growing importance as a prerequisite to responsible, well-paying jobs. Partly because relatively few minorities had been able to acquire the \\ necessary undergraduate education, their enrollments in law and medical schools were negligible. Even when the undergraduate prerequisites were met by minorities, they were still not welcome at most graduate schools. 73 16 j Medical Schools It was not until 1847 that the first black, David J. Peck, received an M.D. from an American medical school, Rush ~c'lical College. 74 The f:trst medical school to enroll large numbers of blacks was Howard University, which was established in Washington~ D.C., in 1868 in an attempt to meet the urgent health needs of thousands of freedmen. 75 Meharry Medical School at central Tennessee College was the second medical sc~ool established primarily for blacks; it began operating in 1876 with fewer than a dozen students. 76 Meanwhile, prospects for black students at white medical schools were bleak. Three blacks were admitted to Harvard Medical School in 1850, but were ejected after a year at the insistence of white students.77 In 1876, a black admitted to the University of pennsylvania Medical School was asked to sit behind a screen in the classroom. 78 Despite these obstacles and indignities, a trickle of black doctors did emerge from the Nation's medical schools. Still, the chronicle is hardly one of steadily increasing gains and acceptance; rather, there were frequently bitter reversals, as when Northwestern 17 University in 1928 initiated a policy of excluding blacks from its medical school. 79 In 1938 only 1.6 percent of all medical students were black. 50 By 1948 a third of the approved medical schools in the united states still did not admit black students. 51 The result of such patterns was that blacks by 1950 were only 2.2 percent of all physicians while they were 10 percent of the Nation's total population. 52 Minority talent therefore sought opportunity beyond the borders of the United states. For example, Dr. Charles R. Drew, a black physician, received his M.D. from McGill University in Canada and carried out some of his best work in England. 83 Their exclusion from American medical schools led Mexican Americans in the early 1970s to appeal to the President of Mexico for assistance. He responded by offering 40 scholarships to medical schools in Mexico, with the expectation that the graduates would practice in the Southwestern United states. The program has produced four doctors, and several dozen students are currently enrolled. e4 By 1970 blacks were still only 2.1 percent of all physicians in the united states although blacks were a little over 11 percent of the Nation's total 18 I 1 1 population. 8s In the Nation's medical schools during the same year, blacks were 3.8 percent of enrollment;86 Eispanics accounted for at least 4.4 percent of the population, but only 0.5 percent of medical school enrollment; 87 while American Indians were 0.4 percent of the population in 1970, only 18 American Indians were enrolled. os Data on minority students in medical schools in california further illustrate the underrepresentation. In 1965, th.e University of California's medic'al schools at Los Angeles and San Francisco enrolled just two blacks and no Mexican Americans out of a total of 198 students. 89 First-year enrollment grew to a total of 400 medical students by 1968 with the addition of several medical schools, but of this number there were only seven blacks and one Mexican American. 90 Yet in 1970, Mexican Americans and blacks constituted about 25 percent of the population in California. 91 19 President Lyndon B. Johnson summed up the dismal historical record when he said of the underrepresentation of black physicians, \"That just is not right. That is a tragedy a complete indictment of our entire educational system fl92 Law Schools The position of minorities in law bas been similar. In the early years of this Nation's development, one entered the legal profession by serving an apprenticeship under a sponsor, who was usually a well-known and respected lawyer. Blacks had great difficulties obtaining the required sponsors, however, and thus were blocked from practicing law.93 As noted, even during the early decades of this century few minorities were able to attend major universities, and the only black institution offering a full legal program was Howard University.94 Members of other minority groups faced similar obstacles. For example, two Asian American applicants to the bars of California and the state of Washington in 1890 and 1902 were denied admission, as a result of their race and despite the fact that one had studied at Columbia and Yale universities. 95 In 1970 blacks were 1.3 percent, Hispanics 0.9 percent, and American 20 Indians 0.1 percent of the legal profession. 96 That same year, total enrollment at the Nation's law schools was only 2.6 percent black, 0.7 percent Hispanic, 0.6 percent Asian American, and less than 0.1 percent American Indian. 97 MINORITY NEEDS IN LAW AND MEDICINE Minority underrepresentation in the study and practice of law and medicine is particularly serious given the great need for improved health care and legal services among minority groups. A recent report on the health differentials between white and nonwhite Americans concluded: The health of nonwhites is not as good as that of whites, yet nonwhites get less--and possibly less effective--health care than whites dO Nonwhites still experience nearly 50 percent more bed disability days, 70 percent higher infant mortality and a life expectancy six years shorter than that of whites. Nonwhites are more likely than whites to suffer from a number of specific conditions known to be improved by health care, which may indicate failure to receive needed prevention or treatment. 90 The study also found that: whi tes make about 10 percent more visits to physicians on the average than do nonwhites. This is primarily because fewer nonwhites see a physician at all, which is in turn attributable to lack of a regular source of care So far as effectiveness is concerned, the care nonwhites receive is more 21 likely to lack continuity and personal attention. 99 Language and cultural barriers pose an obstacle for some minority groups seeking health care. Few health and wel[are agencies have bilingual staffs, and the haphazard administration of these services for the non-English-speaking clients results in poor services for language-minority citizens. The elderly in minority communities are an example of a group especially prone to suffer from this problem. IOO The fact that nonwhites face barriers to adequate health care that may include \"shortages of health manpower or facilities where they live and discrimination in areas where providers do exist\"IOl makes abundantly clear how past and continuing discrimination against minorities has affected their physical well-being. similar problems exist with respect to legal services. The American Bar Association has noted that: the shortage of minority attorneys, resulting in the shortage of minority prosecutors, judges, public officials, governors, legislators, and the like, constitutes an undeniable compelling state interest. If minorities are to live within the rule of law, they must enjoy equal representation within the legal system. 102 22 ) , The Legal Aid Societies of nine cities and the NAACP emphasize the importance of minority participation in the field of law: In many individual lawyer-client relationships, the race of the lawyer is undoubtedly irrelevant, but it can hardly be disputed that the rights of minority groups will be better protected if there are more minority attorneys. This is especially true in those situations in which racial discrimination is involved, or in cases in which it might be unpopular for white attorneys to represent minority clients. 103 Legal training does more, of course, than prepare young people for careers as lawyers. It also prepares them to teach law and to serve as administrators at law schools. A background in law also often sets the stage for public service through both elected and appointed positions, including legislators, mayors, district attorneys, and judges. Minority groups remain seriously underrepresented in such positions. 1o Before the fair representation of minority lawyers as prosecutors, legislators, judges, and Governors can occur, a sufficient number of minority lawyers--who will also articulate and defend the legal concerns of minorities--must be educated. 23 It has been argued that for both doctors and lawyers: Race is, in fact, an important factor in choosing what kind of practice to pursue, in what location, and for the custom of what kinas of clients. Further, doctors perform important functions in determining priorities and modes for the delivery of health services, as lawyers and judges do for legal services. In all the varieties of judgments that need to be made in such matters, it is certainly not irrational to believe that racial diversity is desirable, indeed essential. Nor is it inconsistent with known facts to think that clients to be served by the professions, particularly the poor, the under-represented, and the disadvantaged, deserve the choice of the opportunity of consulting with racially identifiable doctors or lawyers they believe will best understand and sympathize with their problems; it is certain that race has, in fact, played an enormously important role in their own lives.los The society of American Law Teachers observed that the unmet health and legal needs of minorities were compounded by the fact that \" in the past at least .. white physicians and lawyers have shown no great disposition toward meeting the needs of racial minorities for medical and legal services.\"lo6 24 NEED FOR LEADERSHIP AND ROLE MODELS Lack of opportunities for minority members to study and practice law and medicine has had consequences that extend far beyond those professions. One of the most important has been to deprive a multiracial, multicultural Nation of the potential talents of mino:.tJ!.ty leaders, and this in turn has left minority youth with proportionately fewer role models than in the majority community. AS has been pointed out: the role of the lawyers and physicians within a con~unity often goes well beyond their professions They serve as community leaders, as a means by which the community gains access to government officials and legislators, and as role models for youth in the community.107 As another commentator concluded, \"Professional status is a vitally important factor in shaping minority group self-respect and capacity for effective civic participation and self-government.\"1oe Minority professionals are also needed to help important institutions become better able to serve all citizens. For example, an assistant attorney general for the United states recently observed: We need role models, not only for black studen'ts, but for universities to fashion programs to maximize minority student 25 ----------------------------------------------------. retention, for recruiting programs for f'acul ty and other employees, and for programs to ensure nondiscriminatory treatment of minority students and faculty. 109 The carnegie Council on policy studies in Higher Education recently concluded that: Individuals with potential talent from all segments of society should have a fair chance to rise to positions of leadership both in simple justice to them and in service of the need for leaders, models of advancement, and mentors for those in comparable life circumstances. The need is especially urgent within those groups deprived of such opportunities in the past.110 26 Notes to Chapter I 1.

This case involved segregated railroad cars, but the Court in Plessy cited decisions which upheld separate but equal schooLs in Massachusetts and the District of Columbia. At issue in Plessy v. Ferguson was a Louisiana statute wrich required that railroads car\\,\" ng passengers within that state provide separate accommodations for whites and blacks. Tlle Supreme Court upheld the statute's constitutionality. In doing so, it noted, among other things, that laws which provided for separate schools for children of different colors had been ena~ted by legislatures of many of the States and had been generally sustained by the courts. 13. cumming v.

Inclusion of the Japanese children among those to be segregated prompted protests from the Japanese Government. Faced with a potential international crisis, the Federal Government intervened and finally convinced the school board in February 1907 to rescind the segregation policy in return for a commitment from President Theodore Roosevelt to take steps to end immigration of Japanese laborers to the U. S. mainland. 30 The California code was amended in 1921 to include Japanese children among those for Whom separate schools could be established; and who, if such schools were established, could not be admitted into any other schools.

A common but erroneous belief among persons outside the academic world is that written entrance tests and undergraduate grade point averages provide absolute indicators of student ability and that high test scores and grades largely guarantee admission to the study of law and medicine. While these measures are given heavy weight in the evaluation of applicants for admission, other important aspects of a student's background are also considered. These include undergraduate major and course work, extracurricular activities, community service, past employment, motivation, place of residence, age, sex, and race. The Association of American Law Schools (AALS) observes, \"The focus of the admissions decision is... which of the applicants will best serve the purpose for which the school was created, that of supplying professionals needed by the community.\"l The Association of American Medical Coll(~ges (AAMC) describes the admissions process as intended \"to 38 I J select from among applicants deemed qualified to study medicine those who, in the judgment of a duly constituted admissions committee, will become high\u00ad quality physicians most likely to contribute to the needs of the nation. or the state for medical care.\"2 The numerical and subjective criteria that are the basis of admissions decisions by law and medical school administrators are identified in this chapter. NUMERICAL FACTORS Entrance Tests Entrance test scores are used by many law and medical schools in an effort to predict student performance. The Law school Admission Test (LSAT) and the Medical college Admission Test (MCAT) were first used as standardized examinations in the late 1940s. These tests (which are taken at a full 1-day session) are now required almost universally of law and medical school applicants. Quantitative test scores, however, are seldom. if ever. used as the sale standard for ranking applicants. Individual schools vary the weight they place on MCAT and LSA~ scores. The MCAT is administered by the American College Testing Program of Iowa City, Iowa, under the supervision of the Association of American Medical 39 Colleges. Scores are reported in six areas of knowledge and ability: biology, chemistry, physics~ science problems, and two skills sections--reading and quantitative analysis. 3 Most medical schools agree that in reviewing applicants' test results \"the science and quantitative scores are the two figures that should be concentra ted on.\" 4 Other areas of academic knowledge examined by the MCAT test generally are given less weight in the evaluation of test scores. The practice of placing heavier emphasis on just two areas of inquiry rather than others reflects the discretionary judgment employed by professional institutions in their admissions procedures. Mean scores achieved on the MCAT rose from 500 (out of a possible 795) in 1951 to 600 in 19765 as competition for admission intensif~ed with the increasing number of applicants. An official of the Association of American Medical Colleges observed that any score \"over 600 is considered good,U6 but the association points out that applicant scores of less than 600 do not necessarily indicate the absence of qu~lification for the study of medicine. 7 The MeAT examination was originally developed as a means of reducing medical school attrition, and it has 40 successfully done so over the years~8 The AAMC emphasizes, however, that medical colleges have long made use of a variety of other evaluative criteria in addition to the MeAT, and that researchers are currently \"exploring the development of additional instruments to measure personal qualities deemed necessary for the practice of medicine. \"9 The MeAT has been the subject of a substantial body of research, and some studies have suggested that the test may poe~ib1y be negatively (or only minimally) correlated to specific performance as a student, intern, clinician, or practicing physician. 1o The Law School Admission Test (LSAT) is administered by the Educational Testing Service of Princeton, New Jersey, under the direction of the Law Schoc', Admission Council. The LSAT is divided into six sections (reading comprehension, reading recall, error recognition, sentence correction, data interpretation, and principles and cases).!! Scores are reported as a single combined figure, with a possible top score of 800~ Li~T scores rose so substantially between 1961 and 1976 that a score which in the 1960s would have secured access to the Nation's most selective law schools was by 1977 the bare minimum required at a full 41 two-thirds of all law schools. 12 The numerical test scores of many applicants currently being rejected would easily have qualified them for study just 10 years ago.13 Admission to the Nation's top law schools currently requires LSAT scores of about 690.14 The LSAT, like the MeAT, is not claimed to predict actual future performance as a practicing professionalw 15 One expert even questions the value of the LSAT as the sole indicator of future performance in law school. He observed that nan applicant's UGPA [undergraduate grade point. average] is normally a better indicator of law school performance than is the LSAT, and if a school had to choose to use only one predictor it should choose the UGPA.\"16 The UGPA, this expert added, may serve as an indicator of motivation and effort in undergraduate studies. The law school admission process typically combines LSAT scores with the undergraduate grade point average of applicants in a mathematical formula that produces a single figure variously known as an admi~sion index, predictive index, or predicted first\u00ad year average. At some schools, the use of this combined admission index also pr()vides for adjustment of the weight given to grade av(~ages and to LSAT 42 scores. For instance. at the Georgetown University Law center, the index incorporates the candidate's weighted 1? LSAT score, adjusted undergraduate average. and LSAT college mean figure (which increases or decreases the weight placed on the applicants' gradeS}.18 At institutions using such a procedure, the weight given in the formula to grades or test scores is determined by admissions officers on the basis of experience and validity studies. At the UCLA School of Law, the predictive index formula has in 't.he past weighted the UGPA and L$AT scores equally in a single combined figure. Most admissions to the 350 first-year places in the 1976-77 entering class were made from the predictive index scores of some 3,400 applicants and produced a group of enrollees whose median LSAT score was 670 and whose median UGPA was 3 .. 82 .. 19 Undergraduate Grades Undergraduate grade point averages are the second set of numerical criteria evaluated in the admissions process. Again, these numbers may be subjectively weighted and evaluated. Some schools place heavier weight on grades than on test scores while other schools reverse this emphasis,2o and some professional 43 schl)ols consider that grades earned at some undergraduate schools are Itworth more\" than those earned at other universities. Thus, a set value may be added to or subtracted from each candidate's UGPA depending on the perceived excellence or weakness of the institution from which the UGPA was earned. 21 Furthermore, a steadily rising grade curve in the last 2 years of undergraduate work is sometimes interpreted favorably and can serve as grounds for discounting a relatively low 4-year average. 22 The grade point averages of applicant~ may on occasion receive seemingly arbitrary interpretations that may be plausible but difficult to validate. One medical college noted, for instance, that it rarely takes a straight \"A\" student because \"that is likely to mark the kind of uptight individual who is unsuited for medicine. \"23 In the case of law school applicants, a UGPA, a low LSAT score, and the absence of extracurricular activities or work while attending undergraduate schools may offer similar negative implications for future professional work.24 44 SUBJECTIVE AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS As noted, law and medical schools do not determine admissions solely on the basis of numerical indicators. They attempt to obtain a broad understanding of the applicant as a student, citizen, and aspiring profes\"ional. One law school administrator stressed, \"You have to look at the total person.. Admissions committees must look beyond the LSAT and UGPA. It takes some special effort to get all the information you need to do this, but it is there.\"25 This view is echoed by the Association of American Law Schools: [E]ach school, in its own way, attempts to make the best possible prediction as to the relative quality of the applicants. Everything that is known about them is taken into consideration: the applicants' personal statements, their work histories, the nature of subjects taken in undergraduate college or differences in grading standards between colleges, the trend of an applicant's undergraduate grades, the possible effect of a disadvantaged background upon the validity of predicted performance, and every other factor that the particular school thinks can possibly be utilized in making a judgment as to the relative quality of the applicants. 26 In the same vein, the Association of American Medical Colleges stresses: Undergraduate gr9de point averages (UGPAs) and Medical College Admission Test (MeAT) scores alone are insufficient to predict more than the ability to study medicine, (and] admissions committees rely on the personal 45 interview, commitment to service, and a v'ariety of other biographical characteristics to determine which academically qualified applicants will make the best doctors. 27 The decision of particular institutions to rely on their own judgment and experience in reviewing a variety of applicant criteria as part of the. admissions process is backed by experts in the field. The president of the Educational Testing service observed: [There is an] assumption that scores and grades, properly combined, constitute an adequate or sufficient basis for defining relative merit. The facts simply don't support that assumption. Major areas of human characteristics and functioning, directly relevant to the likelihood of academic and career success, are omitted from those two useful but incomplete sources of data about a student. It is not only proper for, but incumbent on, an institution to use additional information if it is seeking those applicants most likely to use limited places to best advantage [We] must resist the temptation to fall back on the easily\u00ad quantified indices as the sole or sufficient basis for a rank-order list on which to judge the propriety and even legality of admissions. 28 Areas of Consideration An applicant's age is a factor often considered during the admissions process e More mature students with some \"real world\" work experience are frequently given a degree of preference over younger applicants, but paradoxically one medical school admissions dean 46 j 1 commented, \"we have to consider the actuarial tables: older candidates would be graduated with fewer years of work ahead of them, and students over 30 seem to perform with less success than those who are younger. nZ9 In addition to age, an applicant's past work experience, undergraduate activities, and community service are often viewed as possible assets which \"may demonstrate that a superior academic record was not created only at the expense of everything else.\"30 Another consideration is where the applicant comes from: many schools seek geographic balance or a national cross section of students. 31 preference is generally given, however, to state residents. Some preference may also be accorded applicants who come from urban or rural settings or from an area in the state which is underrepresented in the student body, as is the case at the University of New Mexico, for example. 32 Letters of recommendation are reviewed for insights into the character and abilities of the applicant. The name or title of the person Signing a reference may in some cases be more important than the content of the letter. 33 However, one law school 47 admissions officer told Commission staff that he was personally interested only in \"specifics\" regarding what the applicant has actually done that demonstrate ability, motivation, and character. 3. An essay may be required of applicants concerning their professional interests and goals. Evaluation of these individual essays is subjective and depends largely on the values of the admissions officer reviewing them. 35 Personal interviews with applicants also are one of the most subjective aspects of the admissions procedure. Admissions officers conducting interviews generally have wide latitude in their questioning and discussions. The open-ended nature of the interview is considered an ideal opportunity to test the aspirations and personal qualities of the applicant. One admissions interviewer explained: We study the students to see exactly what they plan to contribute to the medical profession. I would be appalled at any professional school which was willing to admit a student simply on the basis of test scores or grade point averages without looking at their character or the contribution the in(';,vidual will make to the profession. 36 48 SPECIAL INTEREST ADMISSIONS On occasion university presidents, deans, and other top academics do make \"special interest admissions\" outside normal admissions procedures and standards. At one law school, those eligible for such admissions include sons and daughters of alumni, faculty, and staff as well as persons designated by the university president or the dean of the school. \"Benefit\" to the school is said to be the controlling factor in such admissions. 37 The national media in the last 2 years have carried reports indicating that professional school admissions have, in some cases, been viewed as a means of maintaining good relations with influential or well\u00ad to-do individuals who are in a position to assist university appropriations or endowment funds. Most recently news accounts have focused on remarks of the president of Boston University during a 1973 school committee meeting. A transcript quotes President John R. Silber as having said: We need, for example, a list of admissions considerations that we've given. There have been any number of people crawling allover me for admission to our Medical School and our Law School who have never been tapped systematically for a gift to this university. I'm not ashamed to sell those indulgences. 49 --------------------------------We don\u00b7t admit someone to our Medical School 6r our Law School who isn\u00b7t qualified to get in, but at the same time when we facilitate that admission ther,'s no reason why we shouldn't go right back to the person, the father of the person who's been admitted and talk to him about a major gift to the school. We have not done this systematically. 38 At the University of California at Davis, the dean of the medical school, in several instances reported in the ~ Angeles Times, intervened in the admissions process \"to correct injustices in the admissions pro(\"';dure and for public relations reasons. n39 In October 1975, ~ Physician magazine reported that school records indicated that the Chicago Medical School had in 1973 favored 77 out of 91 qualified applicants on whose behalf pledges of financial support were made to the institution over other applicants otherwise equally qualified. 4o Most recently, NBC television's \"Weekend\" program reported on illegal and questionable admission~ procedures in the State of Pennsylvania. The U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania charged: (T]hese schools live and die by what happens in Harrisburg (the State capital], and I think that's why the legislators and the politicians have this kind of hammer over the schools. It is pretty clear, the word on the 50 street is you have to payoff somebody to get into medical school. * * * * * * It is extremely pervasive, far more pervasive than we thought when the investigation started .. .u Legislative pressure on the medical school admissions process in Pennsylvania appears to be a matter of routine, according to one academic official. Dean Joseph DiPalma of Hahnemann Medical College in Philadelphia explained on the same \"Weekend\" program: I would say of all the applications we have, more than half of them will have a letter from a legislator and certainly when any politician recommends a candidate, and does so very strongly, I would be foolish to say that I didn't try to listen and I didn't try to do everything possible that I could. Let's say there's an instance where there's two applicants and by chance the admissions committee considers them to be eligible for admission, and one of these applicants is favored by a prominent politician, well naturally you'll take the one who\u00b7s favored since the world works by doing favors so I think there is this slight disadvantage. 42 The Carnegie Council on Policy studies in Higher Education recently concluded that \"too many favors have been given by too many institutions, including professional schools, to those with special influence. such actions do not meet the test of fairness, hO'o1ever realistic 'they may be as specific policy actions. 1143 51 In sum, admissions based solely on quantifiable indicators appear to be the exception at the majority of law and medical schools throughout the united states. More than two-thirds of all American law schools specifically state that admissions decisions are based on factors beyond grades and test scores. The 117 medical schools emphasize, without exception, that admissions are not based on quantifiable factors alone--character, personality, age, residence, general health, recommendations, background (geographic, economic, ethnic, or racial), and extracurricular activities are among other areas of consideration. 44 Most schools choose to employ the admissions process as an effort to come to a broader understanding of the applicant as both a student and as a member of society.45 In the final analysis, the admissions process at law and medical schools depends for fairness, equity, and credibility upon the thoughtful nature and even-handedness of those making admissions decisions and administering schools of profeSSional education. 52 NOtes to Chapter II 1.

AFFIRMATIVE ADMISSIONS PROGRAMS The underrepresentation of minorities in the study and practice of law and medicine has led many educatorL to reevaluate the traditional admissions process in order to identify the major barriers to minority admissions and to determine how these barriers might reasonably be removed. The growing reo.li.zation that changes were necessary was expressed by a former president of the Law school Admission council: We cannot continue to penalize people because of the past educ~tional deprivation. We cannot simply \"endorse\" consequences of past discrimination. We must take into account that minorities have been denied educational opportunities available to others. [And we must be] always influenced by the fact that college grades depend on high school attended which depends on the grade school attended. 1 Consistent with this understanding, many admissions officers concluded that still greater flexibility was needed in the traditional admissions process in order to assess properly minority applications. As noted, this approach had steadily gained support with respect to evaluation of the increasing number of all candidates for law and medical schools. 59 Growing recognition that entrance tests served as the major barriers for minorities ad.ded further support for change. Because minority students generally tend to score lower than nonminority students on the Law School Admission Test and the Medical College Admission Test,2 minorities have been blocked at disproportionate rates from attending law and medi<::al schools. Some critics maintain that those tests have a built-in \"cultural bias\" that accounts for the lower scores of minorities. In 1974 the president of the Law School Admission Council, which supervises the LSAT program, urged that reviewers be \"suspicious of traditional predictors of success for minority applicants because of the strong possibility of bias.\"3 Former Supreme Court Justice William o. Douglas also questioned the LSAT's ability to measure minority qualifications for law study: These minorities have cultural backgrounds that are vastly different from the dominant caucasian. Many Eskimos g American Indicms, pilipinos, Chicanos, Asian Indians, Burmese, and Africans come from such disparate backgJcounds that a test sensitively tuned for most applicants ~iOuld be wide of the mark for many minorj,ties Insofar as LSAT'S reflect the dimensions and orientation of the organization Man they do a disservice to minori ties. 4 60 A task force report on the MCAT by the Association of American Medical Colleges observed, liThe verbal and gemeral information sections of the current MCAT have potential for unfair bias against many applicants, particularly socially deprived students and students from many racial and ethnic minori'ty groups.\"S This question of test bias against minorities is argued at length in numerous studies. 6 In light of the fact that, on the average, minorities do score lower than nonminorities on these tests, LSAT and MCAT scores are weighed less heavily in affirmative admissions programs than in traditional admissions programs, and greater attention is paid to otheri nonquantifiable standards. To be sure, the MCAT and LSAT are still widely used to screen out those persons who are manifestly unqualified to study medicine and law, but once the field has been narrowed, the task of admissions committees turns from exclusion to selection. The essential difference between \"traditional\" and \"affirmative\" admissions programs at law and.medical schools is that the latter have added race or minority status or cultural disadvantage to the numerous nonacademic criteria (such as residence of applicant, 61 political or alumni contacts, veteran status, physical handicaps, or location of intended professional practice) used in the final selection of those applicants who have already qualified for further consideration by virtue of their test scores and undergraduate record. In this context, tithe practice to be justified (was] not the departure from test scores and grades, but the much narrower decision to include race among the factors that may warrant such departures. 117 Administrators felt compelled to conclude that \"what might be an impermissible way to take race into account in the ideal soc:iety, may also be a desirable and appropriate way to take race into account, given the social realities.\" s By the close of the 1960s, more than half of the Nation's law schools and at least two-t.hirds of its medical schools had implemented some type of affirmative admissions program. 9 At present almost all law and medical schools have included some consideration of racial or ethnic background in their admissions processes. 10 Although the mechanics of affirmative admissions programs vary from school to school nationally~ the principle basic to each program is that \"differences in academic credentials among qualified 62 applicants are not the sole nor best criterion for judging how qualified an applicant is in terms of his potential to make a contribultion \" 11 THE ROLE OF RACE OR MINORITY STATUS IN AFFIRMATIVE ADMISSIONS PROGRAMS In attempting to consider more fully the applications of minorities, admissions committees attempt to \"look at the total person,\"12 so that the \"credentials of an individual (can be assessed] in terms of the factors that influenced the production of those credentials.\"13 Accordingly, many law and medical schools take note of a wide range of background information, including racial and ethnic origins. One prominent researcher has suggested that the following variables may be reliable indicators of minority academic success: 1. Positive self-concept; 2. Ability to underst,and and deal with racism; 3. Realistic self-appraisal; 4. Willingness to defer immediate gratification for long-range goals; 5. Availability of strong support person; 6. Successful leadership experience within the racial/cultural environment; 63 7. Demonstrated community service. 14 Successful completion of previous academic work by a minority candidate despite substandard school environment and socioeconomic disadvantage may indicate a high level of motivation. One observer said that in his years of admissions work he had found that: Minorities frequently demonstrate a motivation and a commitment which is unusual, extraordinary This motivational factor is a significant predictor of future performance whereas the LSAT is still not satisfactorily measuring all that goes into professional accomplishment and performance. 1S To the extent that academic credentials are still relied upon in the admissions process, race or ethnicity often serves as an interpretive factor in examining minority test scores and undergraduate grades. At some universities affirmative admissions means that \"academic achievement is measured not only by how high the applicant stands, but also by how far he has had to climb from where he began.\" 16 An acceptable or good academic record supplemented by extracurricular activities, community service, or self-support during college may reveal a unique breadth of experience and the ability to handle heavy workloads. An expressed commitment by a minority candidate to assist underserved (or unserved) minority 64 communities or geographic locations ~ay coincide with a law or medical school's determination to playa larger role in addressing society's unmet needs. The backgrounds of minorities may typicallY reveal strengths in languages and an understanding of minority cultures and socioeconomic settings largely absent from the current practice of law and medicine. Thus, race or ethnic background can serve to identify candidates who bring special, needed attributes and knowledge to their professional studies. l? To assess fully the qualities that minority ap;-:'licants may bring to professional studies, minority professors or students often participate in the selection process at insti'Cutions with affirmative admissions programs. For minorities, a key question put by the chairperson of the Asian American Law students Association is: \"Who participates in the evaluation process--who is applying the criteria? This is crucial because no matter what criteria are established, it is the persons who apply them that make the ultimate, final, subjective decision. illS Some law and medical schools have designated minority students or admissions subcommittees to recommend which minority applicants should be admitted. 19 For example,. a pa.nel 65 of minority students at the UCLA school of Law reviews the qualifications of minority applicants, interviews them, and ranks its choices. 20 Panel recommendations have generally been accepted by the law school, which since 1967 has admitted entering classes that are approximately 20 percent minority.21 The minority student panel offers familiarity wi t:h minority communities and schools, understanding of social, economic, and educational disadvantage and the nbstacles that minorities face in higher education, and knowledge of professional needs within minority populations. Thus, the participation of minorities in the admissions process provides some further assurance that the backgrounds of minority applicants will be thoroughly understood and evaluated. Such consideration of minority applicants in affirmative admissions programs is viewed by legal and medical professional associations as necessary to increasing the number and quality of minority students. The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) maintains that the evaluation process can and should consider race among the other \"relevant personal characteristics\" of applicants: 66 At the request of the medical schools, the Association is exploring the development of additional instruments to measure personal qualities deemed necessary for the practice of medicine. Seven of these qualities have been identified by AAMC researchers for study: ~ompassion, int.erprofessional relat~?ns, coping capability, sensitivity in inter~ersonal relations, decision-making capacity, staying power, and realistic self\u00ad appraisal ..... 22 Most medical schools believe that race is a very relevant personal characteristic which should be considered with other criteria to provide insight into the kind of physician the applicant will become. 23 This emphasis in affirmative admissions programs on personal qualities was explained by a professor at UCLA's medical school: There was the realization among the faculty that perhaps there had been injustices, inequities. We looked around and found qualified applicants, minorities and whites, that the application procedures were missing. We moved to revamp the process to look at the total person. There's now a great emphasis on potential. 24 Similarly, the Law School Admission council maintains: Like academic achievement, other accomplishments may help to predict the professional role a student will fill, and how well he will succeed. Non-academic experience, demonstrated interests, personal qualities, geographic and cultural ties are all relevant as predictors of the probable professional contribution, and how and where it will be made. To fill all the varying needs, law schools seek a wide diversity of backgrounds among their students. To this end, an applicant's status as a member of a 67 racial or ethnic minority is undeniably relevant in appraising his potential contribution to the profession. 25 Taking race or ethnicity into account in the admissions process has by no means meant that \"unqualified\" minority applicants are being admitted to professional studie~. As noted earlier, available research questions the contention that applicants with higher MeAT c)r LSAT scores a.re better qualified to enter medical or legal studies and careers. 26 Despite this evidence, these test ~scores have been combined wi th undergradua\u00b7te grades to produce \"benchmark scores,\" which thl~n may be applied with little flexibility to rank qualified applicantsu Any individual ranked in this way may appear to be less qualified than he or she actually is. As one faculty member put it, \"The serious thought that goes in\u00b7to the admissions process is to achieve fairness, and that requires that every applicant admitted be fully qualified.\" 27 The Law School Admission council notes, \"Those [minorities] admitted are fully qualified for law study, exceeding the average levels for all applicants of fifteen years ago, and are predicted to perform well above minimum law 68 school standards. \"28 The Association of American Medical Schools explains that: It must be clearly understood that many of the minority applicants who were and r\";lOuld still be excluded from medical school in the absence of special admissions programs are academically qualified to study medicine. 29 The longstanding exclusion of minorities owing to heavy reliance on numerical qualifications now has been generally recognized by both legal and medical schools and the professional associations. Affirmative admissions principles have been accepted as the best way to ensure equal educational opportunity and to encourage adequate representation of qualified minorities in the study and practice of law and, medicine .. 30 MINORITY ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE Available data tend to S\"1pport the contention that minorities, once admitted, have increasingly attained a level of academic performance in law and medical schools generally' comparable to that of nonminorities. Many of those successful minority stUdents would not have been enrolled were it not for affirmative admissions programs. Research involving minority students in UCLA's Legal Educational Opportunity Program (LEOP) compared 69 their academic credentials (LSAT scores and grades) and su.bsequent performances ion law school with those of the white students. The study showed that \"minority students with good, but not necessarily [top] law school credentials, that is, LSAT ar.-:ve 520 and GPA (grade point average) above 3.20, seem to perform almost as well as their regularly admitted counterparts with LSAT's one hundred an.d fifty points higher.\":H Another research project, at the school of medicine at the university of California, San Diego, compared the performances of 23 black and Mexican American students enrolled under affirmative admission procedures with 21 students admitted under regular procedures. The two groups wexe compared at three stages: MeAT entrance scores and undergraduate grade point averages; the National Board of Medical Examiners Test (completed midway through medical school); and performanc~s on the medicine, surgery, and pediatrics internships (completed near the end of medical education). The wide gap between the two groups on quantitative entrance criteria diminished slightly by the time the national board examination was taken. ~ollowing completion of two of three major clinical internships, howev6r, the difference between the two 70 groups was .10 mor e than \"the distinction between a aslightly above average' level of performance for the regularly admitted students and an 'average' level [of performan\u00a2,'j for students admitted on variances.\"32 one of the 23 minority students in this study would have been admitted to this medical school had it not been for affirmative admissions considerations. 33 Further support for the assertion t-:lat differences in minority and nonminority test scores do not predict comparable differences in academic performance is found in a 1970 study by the Association of American Medical colleges. Data from that study show that blacks who had successfully completed their first 2 years of medical school had lower mean MeAT scores than whites who had been dismissed fo~ academic reasons. 34 The study concluded that \"blacks can succeed in medical school with lower levels of MCAT performance than the successful white student.\"35 11 EFFECT OF AFFIRMATIVE ADMISSIONS PROGRAMS In the past decade, affirmative admissions efforts appear primarily responsible for the increasing minority enrollment in law and medical schools. For example, before the Legal Educational opportunity Program at UCLA started in 1967, that law school was averaging only two minority' graduates a year. The dean of admissions there stressed: To go from having virtually no minority students in 1966 to admitti~g 232 in the next five years and 444 in the eight years since the program began represents a very significant development in legal education and in the future of the legal profession. 36 Nationwide, affirmative a~missions programs brought rapid results as they became widely used in the late 1960s.. A study of the 1,122 black, Puerto Rican, American Indian, and \"other\" minority first-year law students in 1968 found \"that about 40 percent of the minority students enrolled that year would not have been accepted (in the judgment of the admissions officer) under the regular entrance criteria.\"37 In a similar study in 1974, when there were 3,308 first-year minority law students, interviews with 250 of them (205 blacks and 45 Chicanos) disclosed that 80 percent of the respondent law studen'l'.s felt that they were 72 \"special admits.tt38 Citing the \"roughly five-fold increase\" in minorities in medical education since 1968-69, the past president of the University of Washington stated, \"Most of this increase, which was brought about by increased enrollment in predominan\"cly white medical schools, would not have occurred had it not been for changes made within these schools to ~mprove the representation of these minorities.\"39 By fall 1977, minority enrollment in u.s. medical colleges had increased to just over 10 percent of the total from the less than 3 percent that existed in the late 1960s. Blacks were 6 percenti Mexican Americans, 1.4 percent; Asian and Pacific Island Americans, 2.4 percent; mainland Puerto Ricans, 0.4 percent; and Ameri,.::an Indians, O~ 3 percent o During the 8-year period from 196~ to 1977, oveI:all enrollment in medical school increased from 37,690 to 60,039 (a 59 percent increase), while minority enrollment grew from 1,630 to 4,880 (an increase of nearly 200 percent) 1 it should be noted that 83 percent of the 6,000 black physicians in 1967 were trained at Howard and Meharry medical schools.\u00b7 2 The primary benefiaries, however, of this medical school enrollment growth have been white students who 73 have continued to be enrolled in numbers well above the proportion of whites in the total population. 43 In 1970, first-year minority medi :al students were 4.5 percent of the total. In 1974, minority enrollment was 10 percent. The proportion of first-year minority students in medical school has dropped substantially from the peak reached in 1974.44 In law schools, minority enrollment in first\u00ad degree legal studies rose in the fall of 1977 to approximately 8.4 percent from just 4.3 percent in the late 1960s. In 1977, blacks were 4.7 percent out of all first-degree law students; Mexican Americans were 1.2 percent; Puerto Ricans and all other Hispanics were about 1 percent; Asian and Pacific Americans were 1.2 percent; and American J.ndians and Alaskan Natives were 0.3 percent of the total.45 Between 1969 and 1977, total national enrollment in ABA-approved legal studies increased by 68,386 to 118,557 (a 73.5 percent increase). During the same 8-year period, total minority enrollment grew from 2,933 to 9,597 (an increase of more than 225 percent).46 In law schools, minorities also accounted for just over 8 percent of all students in 1976-77, nearly double the proportion in 1969-70. Some 4.8 percent of 74 l all law students in 1916-77 were black; 2 percent were Hispanic; 1.1 percent, Asian and Pacific American; and 0.2 percent American Indian. 47 There was an increase of 43 percent in total law school enrollment from 1969- 70 to 1976-77, but minority enrollment jumped by 225 percent during that same period. 48 An important byproduct of the affirmative admissions programs in higher education has been a heightened sense of anticipation among minorities about opportunities once closed to them~ In a 1974 analysis of affirmative admissions, one scholar noted tha\"c although: many factors undoubtedly account for the rise in minority (applications to professional schools] chief among them appears to be the knowledge that predominantly white institutions will now give special consideration to race--that there is, in other words, some incentive to apply.49 The deterrent effect of traditional college admissions policies on minority aspirations through the late 1960s seems to have lessened considerably with the increasing perception by minorities that the door to profeSSional ~\u00b7:t,'dy has finally been opened by affirmative admissions et ;orts. Anothp.r important reason for and result of the development of affirmative admissions programs is the 75 enhanced quality of education received by all students through minority presence in ~he educational environment~ The Association of American Law Schools states: In view of the importance of race in American life and the effect that it is certain to have for the indefinite future, ~t would be startling if faculties had not concluded that the absence of racial minorities in 'law schools, or their presence only in very small numbers, would significantly detract from the educatioi.lal experience of the student body_ As a consequence of our history, race accounts for aome of the most important differences in our society. Precisely because race is so significant, prospective lawyers need knowledge of the backgrounds, views, attitudes, aspirations, and manners of the members of racial minorities. 5o The importance of diversity is further emphasized in an amicus brief before the Supreme Court filed by Columbia UniverSity, Harvard University, Stanford University, and the University of Pennsylvania: A policy of increasing the number of students from minority groups is, in our judgment, the best choice for all of our students because it is the best way to achieve a diverse student body Just as diversity makes the university a better learning environment for the student, so it makes the university a better learning environment for the faculty member It has been the exp~~ience of many university teachers that the insights provided by the participation of minority students enrich the curriculum, broaden the teachers' scholarly interests, and protect them from insensitivity to minority perspectives. 51 76 The American Association of University professors also considers the diversity afforded by affirmative admissions programs essential to the study of law and medicine: There is little doubt that for a subject, such as law, which must confront every pressing social issue, the participation of students of varied social and ethnic backgrounds provides vital additional perspectives and thus a fuller education than were the class socially and ethnically homogeneous. In medical education the reliance of medical schools upon the indigent as clinical \"teaching material\" establishes an iustitutional setting which reinforces the pre-existing class biases of an overwhelmingly white, middle-class medical student body The introduction into the student culture of students [from disadvantaged, racial, or ethnic backgrounds] may play an important role in the process of professional socialization of the entire student class, i.e., in the production of a group of physicians who may be more understanding of--and compassionate toward-\u00adpatients. 52 The Carnegie Council also stressed the relevance of race in admissions when it stated that pr.ofessional schools: 77 must also be conscious of the need to supply grad'lates who will meet the varied needs of th~ profession. These schools therefore have a quite legitimate interest in special persons with special characteristics\u00ad-for example, those who have shown a strong ivterest in community service, or those who have shown they can face adversity and conquer it, through the force of their own personalities--for these characteristics relate directly to potential service within the profession. 53 Two other points may be noted in this discussion of affirmative admissions programs at law and medical schools. One concerns the question of whether minority law or medical school graduates wcmld in fact practice in the minority commutilty. Substantial evidence indicates that they do. A 1976 study by the National. Planning Association, for example, showed an initial correlation indicating that black physicians have a greater tendency than their white counterparts to practice in the primary health care fields which administer direct client services to the minority communities. 54 survey of graduates of Meharry Medical College, a predominantly black institution, revealed that some 80 percent of the graduates were currently practicing in minority communities. 55 Another study by the Association of American Medical colleges found that minorities showed the highest interest in practicing in 78 I i \"physician shortage areas,\" with 78 percent of the minority students showing such an interest in contrast to 41 percent of the white students. 56 Finally, a California study revealed that 84.9 percent of the minority graduates of the major dentistry schools in California were practicing in or immediately adjacent to minori ty nCri tical shortage Manp'Dwer Areas, 11 which have a 50 percent or higher minority popula .. \u00b7.:ion, while 37 percent of these professionals were practicing in areas with higher than 90 percent minority clientele. 57 A second issue involves minority enrollment trends in recent years. It is important to note that minority enrollments have leveled off since 1974. Although minorities now comprise just over 8 percent of the medical school enrollment, that figure has remained constant since 1974. Also, the proportion of four selected minorit.y groups (blacks, American Indians, Mexican Americans, and mainland Puerto Ricans) enrolled in first-year medical classes peaked in 1974 at 10 percent and has since declined to just over 9 percent. 58 In law schools the proportion of minorities is still gradually increasing but the pace has slowed since 1974. 59 The director of AAMC's office of 79 minority affairs attributes the slowdown of minority enrollment in medical schools to two factors: 1) the bleak outlook for financial aid to medical students, especially in light of rising tuition rates, and 2) 'che increased legal issues confronting medical schools ~ith regard to reverse discrimination beginning with the DeFunis case a few years ago.60 A recent study of New York City's seven medical colleges reports that \"after five years of affirmative action, there are fewer minority students enrolled in the 1976 entering class than there were in 1971.\" Citing the 1974-75 economic recession and the decreasing availability of government funding for medical educ.:ation as primary causes for the decreasing minority enrollment, the report warns -chat \"admissions officers now predict that economic conditions coupled with the escalating costs of attending medical school could erase past gains in a few short years.\" 61 with respect to the decreasing availability of financial assistance for medical students, another expert agrees tha t \"it seems hi ghly probable that this financial problem contributed to the subsidence in minority first-year enrollment from 1914-75 to 1975\u00b7\u00b776. \"62 80 ----------------------------------------------------------- The same obs erver commented: n since 1973 the DeFunis case and similar challenges of reverse . discrimination in medical school admissions have encouraged a tendency to vest actual decisions about the ~dmission of all applicants in one committee .. \"63 Enrollment gains have slipped in recent years as \"many universities and colleges have changed their practices in anticipation of a later Court decision\" that might force termination of affirmative admissions programs. 64 MINORITY ENROLLMENT: THE FUTURE Fears as to the dire consequences for minorities if law and medical schools were to revert to sole reliance upon traditional, numerical admission standard~ are supported by recent research of the Educational Testing service (ETS) and the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). One conclusion of the ETS study was that: 81 ~ __________________________________________________________ Uq 'j I , ,I i' If the natio,,' s law schools were to adopt an admissions policy taking no account of minority backgrounds of blacks and Chicanos, a majority of the students from those groups now admitted and enrolled would be excluded. If blacks.and Chicanos were accepted at the rates for non-minorities at the same levels of LSAT and UG~A, the reduction in their enrollments would be 60 percent and 40 percent, respectively. If numerical predictors were employed exclusively for all applicants, the resul\u00b7ting reductions would be 76 to 78 percent for blacks and 45 to 48 percent for Chicanos. When law schools were asked to estimate the number of those minorities who would have been admitted if their minority status was unknown, they estimated reductions of 80 percent for blacks and 70 percent for Chicanos. The percentage of blacks among first-year law students would drop to between 1 and 2 percent from the current 5.3 percent, and the percentage of Chicanos would fall to between .4 percent and .8 percent from the current 1.36 percent. 65 Similarly; the research by the AAMC concludes that: If medical schools had chosen to admit students based solely on one or several of these five traditional criteria [GPA and scores from the four sections of the MCAT], the 15,774 acceptances offered in 1976 would quickly have gone to individuals identified a t the extreme high };'erformance side -,of the curve. At this extreme only a v~ry small proportion of minority applicants could qualify.66 Clearly then, the effect of affirmative admissions programs over the last decade has belen to provide educational opportunity and encouragement to a minority population too long without its fair share of either. ~he Association of American Medical Colleges pr~dicts 82 that \"without special admissions programs it is not unrealistic to assume that minority enrollments could return to the distressingly low levels of the early 1960s.\" 67 The Association of American Law Schools warned that, if law schools discontinue their efforts to seek out and admit qualified minority students, then \"minori ty enrollment will plummet and the hopes of a generation schooled in the traditions of equal opportunity enunciated by Brown will be dashed. 1168 83 Notes to Chapter III 1.

CONCLUSION FOr more than 200 years minorities in the united st.ates were systematically denied equal opportunity at all levels of our society and in particular our educational system. Few now question the historical record although the pervasive effects of this regrettable past still may not be fully appreciated by many Americans. Most minority students still must overcome problems related to lower income, language, inferior educational resources, and discrimination. Such problems leave most white or Anglo students at a relative advantage in the pursuit of college and postgraduate degrees. For many minority students, graduation from high school and college are major successes that white students are likely to take for granted. One consequence of this history of disadvantage is that minority Americans have been severely underrepresented in two important professions, law and medicine, while their basic needs in both areas receive inadequate attention. Entrance to law and medical school has become increasingly costly and competitive. It has been pointed out that the numerical test scores 92 of many applicants currently being rejected would easily have qualified them just 10 years ago.1 This commission has addressed what one commentator refers to as the \"fallacy\" that student admissions to law and medical schools traditionally are based on simple mathematical projections. 2 In fact, various categories of nonminority students have long been \"preferentially treated\" for a number of reasons, some of which have nothing to do with test scores or grade point averages. This is not to argue that two wrongs make a right. Consideration of nonnumerical selection factors such as physical handicap, a student's intention to practice in an area underserved by his or he:r choaen profession,. or geographic location of student applicants is certainly valid and reasonable in admissions decisions. To be sure, the use of race or minority status is different. It is no less fair, however; given the long and lamentable history of discrimination against minorities in higher education, consideration of race or minority status in the admissions process of law and medical schools is certainly justified and appropriate. The commission also has cited evidence that indicates that the beneficiaries of affirmative 93 admissions programs are as well qualified to study law or medicine as their IIconventionally\" admitted peers. Experience increasingly suggests that early disadvantages are remediable and that latent but un~uantifiable ability, if detected by discerning admissions officials, can be brought to maturity. The ingredients of this alchemy are the commitment and motivation of minority students; the catalyst is Simple opportuni ty. The efforts of law and medical schools to increase minority opportunities for study at these institutions have been among the most significan+-, and gratifying civil rights ini tiativ(~s undertaken in the history of our society. Affirmative student admissions programs were initiated by administrators and faculty who accepted as their duty the need to correct, in a positive and reasonable manner, the shameful educational wrongs of the past and the resultant low representation of minorities in law and medical schools. Accordingly, they determined that the student admissions process at these institutions should be revised so as to remove unfair or unnecessary barriers to minOrity access without jeopardizing academic standards. 94 J Questions that arose over the value or reliability of entrance tests have led to less reliance on them and to greater interest by admissions officers in such other considerations as the work background, et.hical sense, commitment, and motivation of each applicant. The inclusion of these factors provides a more rational process for >~valuating not only minority students but also all the Nation's future attorneys and doctors. In this regard, affirmative admissions programs may have contributed to the same kind of beneficial review and reappra1sal of traditional educational policies that school desegregation has brought about in many public elementary and sE!condary schools. 3 In addition to the salutary effects affirmative admissions programs have had on the career opportunities of individu~l members of minority groups, these programs address a clear, indeed compelling, national interest. Minorities and, in/.leed, the Nation stand to gain improved and critically needed health s~rvices. They stand to gain essential legal training that not only contributes to improved legal services but also prepares them for greater participation in the political process. A law or medical school has an 95 affirmative obligation to meet such basic health and legal needs of its given geographic area. In addition, minorities will gain both important role models that will enhance minority group self\u00ad respect and greater representation in the influential upper income and occupation levels. The professions will benefit from the addition of new viewpoints and understanding. Affirmative admissions, by demonstrating to alienated groups the openness and fairness of our SOCiety, will strengthen the Nation as a whole. For these compelling reasons# the commisdion considers affirmative admissions programs at the Nation's law and medical schools entirely proper and worthy of emul~tion rather than condemnation. Turning away from these programs would be an appalling step backward for this society. It could also serve as a signal to individuals and institutions throughout the Nation that what is past is not prologue but is simply forgotten, and that our legacy of historical obligations can be ignored. 96 Notes to Conclusion 1.

Conclusion ........................................ 12 100 INTRODUCTION In the year 1977, nothing is more central to the success of the long struggle to eliminate racinl dis\u00ad crimination from American life than the effort to establish equal access to job and career opportuni\u00ad ties. For the better part of two centuries the Fed\u00ad eral Government was indifferent to employment discrimination or actively fostered its imposition on black people and on other minorities and women as well. Only 13 years ago, with passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, did the emerging consensus that employment discrimination was wrong become a national policy favoring equal employment oppor\u00ad tunity. Title VII of the 1964 law was a clear statement of the national will to end unfair treatment of minor\u00ad ities and women in, the job market. What was not fully appl:l.rent in 1964 was the magnitude of the effort that would be required to create genuine equality of opportunity and the specific measures needed to accomplish the task. While progress has been made during the past decade, the current employment situation provides disturbing evidence that members of grou.ps histori\u00ad cally victimized by discriminatory practices still carry the burden of that wrongdoing. Unemploy\u00ad ment statistics-a critical indicator of economic status-reveal a worsening situation for black peo\u00ad ple and members of other minority groups. In 1967 the national unemployment rate was 3.4 percent for whites and 7.4 percent for racial minorities.' During the economic expansion of the late 1960s, the ratio of black to white unemployment declined. But when the economy entered a recession in the 1970s, minority workers suffered disproportionately. In 1976 the rate of unemployment was 7 percent for whites and 13.1 percent for blacks and other minorities.2 In August 1977 white joblessness de- 1 U.S., Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Employment and Eamings, October 1974, p. 51.

In 1971, when 15.1 percent of white teenagers were jobless, the unem\u00ad ployment rate for minMity teenagers was 31.7 per\u00ad cent..l In 1976 white teenage unemployment stood at 18 percent, while 39.8 percent of minority teen\u00ad agers were unemployed; and by August 1977 unem\u00ad ployment for minority teenagers had reached a staggering 40 percent. r. Income is another important indicator of the status of efforts to achieve equal opportunity. In 197 4 the annual median family income for whites was $13,356, compared with $7,808 for blacks and $9,559 for Hispanics. For most of the past decades, the ratio of black to white family income has remained fairly constant while the dollar gap between the two groups continues to gl'ow. For example, in 1964 the median annual income for black families was $3,724 compared with $6,858 for whites. In 1974 the annual median family in\u00ad come for blacks increased to $7,808 compared with $13,356 for whites. While the ratio of black to white family income has remained fairly constant (at about 2: 3 ), the dollar gap between the two groups has increased from $3,000 to $5,500.(\\ Similarly, the annual median income in 1973 for families headed by males was $12,965, while that for families headed by females was only $5,797. In 1973 women earned a median income which was only 7 57 percent of that earned by men. As the status and rewards of particular types of employment increase, minority participation tends to decline. This is particulary true in the professions where blacks, who are 11 percent of the popula- 3 U.S., Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Employmeflf Situatio.\u00b7l, August 1977.

Although progress has been made in recent years, in 1976 the minority enrollment of American law schools was only 8 percent, including 4.8 percent black and 2 percent Hispanic American students. Medical schools had a similar enrollment pattern, with an 8 percent minority enrollment, includi~ 6 percent black students and 1.2 percent Mexican Americans.9 While these racial disparities in job and economic status may stem from a web of causes, they provide strong evidence of the persistence of discriminatory practices. As the Supreme Court has observed, statistics showing racial or ethnic imbalance are im\u00ad portant in legal proceedings: because such imbalance is often a telltale sign of purposeful discrimination; absent explanation, it is ordinarily to be expected that nondiscriminatory hiring practices will in time result in a work force more or less representative of the racial and ethnic composition of the popUlation in the com\u00ad munity from which employees are hired.1o As the difficulty of fulfilling this expectation has become apparent, debate has also intensified about the necessity and propriety of specific measures de\u00ad signed to eliminate discriminatory practices and their effects on both hiring and admissions decisions. In 1977 the controversy is centered around the concept of \"a.ffirmative action,\" a term that in a broad sense encompasses any measure, beyond simple termina\u00ad tion of a discriminatory practice, adopted to correct or compensate for past or present discrimination or to prevent discrimination from recurring in the future. Particular applications of the concept of affirmative action have given rise to charges of \"reverse discrimination,\" \"preferential treatment,\" and \"quota systems\"-all, in essence, claims that the action sought or imposed goes beyond what is needed to create conditi<. as of equal opportunity for minori- U.S., Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Population Survey, May 1977, and The Social and Economic Status of the Black Population in the United States, p. 75.

The Commission believes that a sensible and fair resolution of the controversy is best served by an t'xamination of the specific decisions made by agen\u00ad cies charged with implementing and interpreting the law, of the reasons for the decisions, and of what the decisions have meant in practical terms to the people affected by them. To this end and to offer our own views, the Commission has prepared this position statement for public discussion and consid\u00ad eration. Part I. Institutional Barriers to Opportunity Perhaps the single most important occurrence in the evolution of equal employment law was the recognition by the U.S. Equal Employment Oppor\u00ad tunity Commission and by the Supreme Court of the United States that the mandate of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 could not be fulfilled simply by prohibiting practices intentionally designed to deny opportunities to minorities.ll In a society marred for years by pervasive discrimination in .hir\u00ad ing and promotion, practices that are not racially motivated may nonetheless operate to disadvantage minority workers unfairly. AccordinglY, in the land\u00ad mark case of Griggs v. Duke Power Company,12 the Supreme Court applied Titl~ VII of the 1964 act to invalidate general inteIBgence tests and other criteria for employment that disproportionately ex\u00ad cluded minorities if they were not shown to be dictated by business necessity. It was conceded that the tests used were not deliberately discriminatory, but the Supreme Court concluded that: [G]ood intent ... does not redeem employment 11 The decisions of the EEOC and the Supreme Court that the concept of discrimination could not be lim\u00ad ited to racially motivated acts were foreshadowed by the adoption of the principle of affirmative action in Executive orders governing Federal contracts. See discussion below, p. 5. \"401 U.S. 424 (1971). 131d. at 432. In a subsequent decision, Albemarle Paper Company v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405 (1975), the Court made clear that even if tests are shown to be job related they may not be used if alternative devices are avail\u00ad able that do not have a discriminatory effect and that also serve the employer's interest in an efficient and trustworthy work force. 102 procedures or testing mechanisms that operate as \"built-in headwinds\" for minority gt'oups and are unrelated to measuring job capability.l~ The principle of the Griggs case has been ap\u00ad plied to other practices that constitute barriers to equal employment opportunity even though they are not invidiously motivated. Among these prac\u00ad tices are the following: The reHance of employers and unions on word\u00ad of-mouth contact as a means for recruiting new employees. Minority workers generally have less access than others to these informal net\u00ad works of employment information, especially when the existing work force is largely white.H The use of minimum height and weight stand\u00ad ards as requisites for jobs in law enforcement and other fields. Such requirements screen out many women and may also have an adver~e impact on Hispanic Americans and other ethmc groups.lr, The use by employers of arrest records as an absolute bar to employment. Many members of minority group'>, particularly those who have grown up in ghetto environments where crime rates are high and people are often ar\u00ad rested on \"suspicion,\" are adversely affected by such requirements despite the fact that they would be honest and reliable employees. to The tendency of some unions and employees to favor relatives of current employees for new positions. Such policies in the construction trades, whether or not racially motivatec1, have operated to perpetuate the effects of past ex\u00ad clusion of minority workersY The relocation of industrial plants from cen\u00ad tral cities to suburban locations where minority 14 See, e.g., Parham v.

'18 While this issue has not been addressed definitive y In the courts it has been suggested that employers, though .not barred fr~m relocatins;! for economic reasons,. are req~ured under Title VII to make efforts to remove barners to minor\u00ad ity employment that may stem from the move. See EEOC Memorandum General Counsel to Chairman, July 7, 1971; Blumrosen ... the Duty to Plan for Fair Employment: Plnnt Location i~ White Suburbia,\" 25 Rutgers L.R. 383 (1971). workers have difficulty in obtaining access to hotlsing.1R The courts have placed some limitations upon the use of an \"effects test\" to bar practices that dis~ advantage minorities or women.lU In 1977 the ~u\u00ad preme Court held that Title VII does not authOrize the invalidation of employers' disability pay pro\u00ad grams that exclude pregnancy from among the dis\u00ad abilities to be compensated for, despite the obvious adverse effect upon women cmployees.2o The Court ha'> also ruled recently that seniority systems that are otherwise neutral and legitimate do not become unlawful under Title VII simply because theY perpetuate the effect of discrimination that occurr~d before passage of the law.2t While . this decision is a setback to efforts to obtain full re- dress for wrongs suffered by minority workers be\u00ad fore 1964 it doe~\u00b7 not appear to impair the Griggs principle, ~ince in the Court's view the holding w.as dictated by section 703 (h) of Title VII, a speclUl provision designed to protect \"bona fide\" seniority systems that were not adopted with an ~ntentjon to discriminate. Moreover, the Court made It clear that seniority systems mllst be modified to provide re\u00ad dress (in the form of retroactive seniority) to .em\u00ad ployees who had been discriminated against after 1964 and that the people entitled to relief include not only employees whose applications were denied, but those who were deterred from applying by the employer's known policy of discrimination.22 The concrete remedies that have flowed from the application of the principle of the Griggs case form a significant component of affirmative action. They include orders that: employers substitute for their old syste~s of word of mouth recruiting specifically deSigned programs to recruit minorities; e.g., visits to black colleges and universities, recruitment ,.

In Griggs, the decision was based in part on the fact that the Duke Power Company had previously intentionally excluded minority applicants from its work force. To permit exclusionary practices to be replaced by a \"neutral\" device that adversely affected minorities would sim\u00ad ply have resulted in the perpetuation of past dis\u00ad crimination. But the decision was also based upon a recognition that, wholly apart from the employer's past practices or current intentions, the tests being used had a discriminatory impact upon minorities. This was so because the disproportionate failure rate of minorities on tests of the kind used by the Duke Power Company is traceable to discrimination by other institutions in our society. As the Supreme Court said in a later decision: Griggs was rightly concerned that childhood defi\u00ad ciencies in the education and background of minority citizens, resulting from forc!!.; beyond their control, not be allowed to work ~t r:umula\u00ad tive and invidious burden on such ..:it:l.l!ns for the rest of their lives. ~n A narrow view would focus exclusively on the question of fault, absolving employers and unions n U.S. v.

Fortunately, in interpreting equal employment statutes, the Supreme Court has rejected that approach in favor of one that permits practical intervention at points where it is possible to create opportunities that have been denied in the past.~; While respecting the rights of employers to insist on qualified workers, the Court has applied equal employment law to require that the methods by which employees are selected do not compound deprivation that minorities have faced in the past. It is important as well to assess the impact on minorities and others of decisions removing institu\u00ad tional barriers to employment opportunity. The dis\u00ad carding of tests or high school diplomas as require\u00ad ments for employment or promotion, the requirement that employers go beyor~j word-of-mouth recruiting, and other similar decisions undoubtedly adversely affect the interests of white employees. All of these steps broaden the field of competition for job oppor\u00ad tunities and decrease the prospects for success that whites had previously enjoyed. In some cases the dis\u00ad appointment of expectations can be quite concrete, as when white applicants for employment or pro\u00ad motion find that eligibility lists on which they may rank high are discarded because the tests on which the lists were based were unvalidated and dispropor\u00ad tionately excluded minorities. Indeed, in some in\u00ad stances what is at stake for white male workers is not simply the disappointment of expectations but a diminution of status or benefits they had already achieved. This is so, for example, when courts order that individual victims of discrimination be .given relief that restores them to the plaee they would have occupied but for the discrimination. When black employees who were denied positions are granted priority consideration for vacancies and full seniority retroactive to the date of denial, white employees who have committed no wrong suffer the hardship of a relative loss of status or benefits. An acknowledgement that the removal of institu\u00ad tional barriers to employment and pursuit of af\u00ad firmative action policies may have adverse effects upon the expectations and status of white employees '1 In another field, the Supreme Court has refused to per\u00ad mit the reinstatement of literacy tests as a qualification for voting because, even though administered impartially, the tests would disadvantage black adults who had previously attended segregated schools. Gaston County v. United States, 395 U.S. 285 (1969). does not mean that courts and other agencies are insensitive to the interests of these employees. In fact, the Supreme Court has held explicitly that white employees are protected from discrimination on the; basis of race both by Title VII and by the civil rights laws enacted during Reconstruction. 2~ Rather, cases based on the Griggs principle in es~ sence hold that protection of the interests of white employees, however innocent of any wrongdoing th(~y may be, cannot be purchased at the expense of a continuing denial of op('ortunity to members of groups that have been subjected to discrimina\u00ad tion.20 Viewed from the perspective of minority workers, the principal beneficiaries of decisions suspending tests or otkx' institutional obstacles to equal oppor\u00ad tunity are people who have suffered discrimination either at the hands of the particular employer or elsewhere in the system. It is true, however, that some minority workers who do not fall into these categories may obtain benefits from the decision. A minority applicant. who has never experienced discrimination in the educational system and whose inability to pass a test is unrelated to discrimination may, nonetheless, gain from a decision to substitute other criteria for hiring for unvalidated tests. The reason is that in this situation it would be extraor\u00ad dinarily difficult to fashion a remedy by proceeding on an individual or case-by~case basis. As the Department of Justice has pointed out in a related context: Decades of discrimination by public bodies and private persons may have far-reaching effects that make it difficult for minority applicants to com\u00ad pete ... on an equal basis. The consequences of discrimination are too complex to dissect case-by\u00ad case; the effects on aspirations alone may raise for minority applicants a hurdle that does not face white applicants . . . and a [school or em\u00ad ployer] dealing with imponderables of this sort ought not to be confined to the choice of either ignoring the problem or attempting the Sisyphean task of discerning its importance on an individual basis.so '\" See McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Construction Co., 427 U.S. 273 (1976). The Court held that a white employee vic\u00ad timized by discrimination could invoke the Civil Rights Act of 1866,42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, in addition to Title VB. .. In situations where white employees suffer direct in\u00ad jury, e.g., a relative loss of seniority status, as a result of action to redress discrimination, they may be entitled to some form of compensation. See discussion below, p. 8. \"\" Brief for the United States as amiclls curiae at 56, Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, No. 76- 811 (U.S. cert. granted February 1977). 105 In short, the task of screening out the few per~ SOilS not entitled to benefit on the basis of past dis~ cl'imination could be accomplished only at the cost of administrative disruption and of further delaying redress for those who have suffered from discrimi~ nation. That cost is simply too large. Part II. Numerically-Based Remedies The principles governing decisions to remove in\u00ad stitutional obstacles to equal employment opportu\u00ad nity are also helpful in analyzing another important a:1d controversial aspect of affirmative action: the use of numbers, either as goals or, \u00b7in some in\u00ad stances, as requirements in fashioning remedies for discrimination. Numerically-based remedies have been used by Federal agencies seeking to imple\u00ad ment laws and Execl':ive orders requiring equal employment opportunity and by Federal courts seeking to devise appropriate remedies for proven discrimination. They have also been used in con\u00ad junction with other affirmative action tools by pub\u00ad lic and private institutions such as colleges and universities undertaking voluntarily to improve op\u00ad portunities for minorities. An understanding of how numerically-based remedies came to be used as an affirmative action tool and how they have been applied in specific contexts is important to any effort to judge their necessity or propriety. Contract Compliance Since the issuance of an Executive order by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on the eve of the Second World War, the Federal Government has pursued a policy of prohibiting racial discrimination in the employment practices of businesses that hold contracts with the \u00b7government. A significant strengthening of the policy came in 1961 when President Kennedy issued a new Execu\u00ad tive order establishing an obligation on the part of Federal contractors not only to refrain from dis\u00ad crimination but to undertake \"affirmative action\" to ensure that equal employment principles are fol\u00ad lowed in all company facilities.3'l >l In its current form, the provision found in Executive Order No. 11246, II, sec. 203, 30 Fed. Reg. 12319, I\\S amended by Executive Order No. 11375, 32 Fed. Reg. 14303, which extended coverage tu women. This order ~ was the first articulation of the con\u00ad cept of affirmative action as a guide tl.t Federal equal employment policy. It constituted a recogni\u00ad tion that a simple termination of overt practices of discrimination might have little impact ort the token representation of minority workers in the labor force of many contractors. The Executive order also re\u00ad flected implicitly a view that, to the extent that employers were prepared to cooperate, the time ane! resources of the contrar;;t compliance program would be better spent in the (bvelopment of new channels of opportunity for minorities than in efforts to assess culpability for discrimination that had oc\u00ad curred in the past. Accordingly, in implementing the order, Federal officials emphasized specific affirma\u00ad tive steps-e.g., visits to black colleges, contacts with minority organizations and media-that em\u00ad ployers would take to increase the participation of minority workers. As the program has evolved, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, the agency that supervises implementation of the Executive order, requires contractors to undertake an evaluation of their patterns of employment of minorities and women in all job categories [41 C.F.R. 60-211(a)]. Once this self-analysis is complete, the employer is required to identify obstacles to the full utilization of minorities and women that mar account for their representation in small numbers in particular cate\u00ad gories and then to develop an affirmative action plan to' overcome the obstacles [41 C.F.R. 60- 1 :40]. The affirmative action plan may include measures for improved recruiting, new training pro\u00ad grams, revisions in the criteria for hiring and pro\u00ad motion, and other steps. While progress was made during the 1960s, it became clear that companies that lacked a strong will to change existing practices might go through the litany of affirmative action steps in a very per\u00ad functory way without securing any significant changes in the actual employment and assignment of minority and women workers. Out of this experience grew the concept of \"goals and timetables.\" Employers are asked to compare their utilization of minorities and women with the proportion of minorities and women in the available and relevant labor pool, a deter\u00ad mination that may vary with the industry of the contractor and the location of the facility or institu\u00ad tion. The contractor is then required to develop 106 goals and timetables for achieving a fuller utilization of minorities and women [41 C.F .R. 60-2: 10 (1974) 1.32 The goals arrived at are generally expressed in a flexible range (e.g., 12 to 16 percent) rather than in a fixed number. They reflect assessments of the availability of minorities and women for employ\u00ad ment, the need for training programs, and the dura\u00ad tion of such programs. The goals are not properly considered fixed quotas, since determinations of compliance are not made solely on the question of whether the goals are actually reached, but on the contractor's good f.lith effort to implement and ful\u00ad fill the total affirmative action plan [41 C.F.R. 60- 214 (1974)]. The employer is not compelled to hire unqualified persons or to compromise genuinely valid standards to meet the established goal. If goals are not met, no sanctions are imposed, so long as the contractor can demollstrat~, that he made good faith efforts to reach them. The validity of the contract compliance program, including its provisions for goals and timetables, has been repeatedly upheld by the courts.3S This has occurred in the face of challenges that the program involves a constitutionally impermissible use of race and conflicts with the congressional policy against requiring an employer to grant preferential treat\u00ad ment simply because of racial imbalances that exist in the work force.84 Although \"goals and timetables\" provisions, like other legal requirements, are capable of misinter\u00ad pretation and abuse in individual cases, there is very little evidence that such abuse has occurred. Experience shows that they have not been treated as fixed quotas requiring the hiring of minorities and women regardless of qualification and circum- 32 These requirements are embodied in Revised Order No. 4, which applies only to nonconstruction contractors. A parallel set of requirements has been developed for the con\u00ad struction industry. Where construction contra0tors fail to arrive at goals and timetables of their OWn in consultation with unions, the OFCCP may impose a plan. Before impos\u00ad ing a plan, the OFCCP holds public hearings to determine the degree of underutilization of minorities, their availability for construction work, and projected construction job op\u00ad portunities.

Indeed, the problem may be one not of overzealousness but of a lack of sufficient vigor. Since 1975 in the con\u00ad struction industry, only three \"hometown\" (volun\u00ad tary) affirmative action plans have met or exceeded the goals set. Of 29 plans on which the OFCCP was able to furnish data, 17 had met less than half the goal; and in 7 of these, less than 20 percent of the goal was attained.85 Lastly, it should be noted -that goals and time\u00ad tables can provide a means for simplifying the re\u00ad medial process and easing the administrative burden of supervision that would otherwise rest on the gov\u00ad ernment and employers. In many situations, an ap\u00ad propriate remedy for discrimination will permit a good deal of subjective judgment to enter into the hiring and promotion process. Safeguarding the rights of minorities would ordinarily require careful checks upon the exercise of such judgment through detailed reporting and close supervision by top man\u00ad agement and by government.30 Goals and timetables can ease that burden by serving as a valuable standard for detennining whether the system is pro\u00ad viding the relief envisaged. Court Orders \u00b7Although goals and timetables are essentially flexible targets, after making specific findings of dis~ crimination, Federal courts have sometimes deter\u00ad mined that an effective remedy dictates the estab\u00ad lishment of fixed requirements for hiring. Typically, a court may require that a specified percentage of all new hires be members of the minority group dis\u00ad criminated against until a specific goal of minority participation in the work force is reached. As with goals and timetables, the ultimate goal is set with reference to the proportion of minority workers in the available and relevant labor pool. Once the goal of minority participation is achieved, past discrimina- 3$ Data from the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (1977). 3d See Cooper.

Steamfitters Local 638, 501 F.2d 622 (2nd Cir. 1974), the court said that the numerical requirement was properly viewed .as a racial \"goal\" > not a \"quota\" because quotas imply perma\u00ad nence.

Gallaglter,3R for example, a Federal court, having found that the Minneapolis Fire De\u00ad partment had engaged in discrimination against minorities, ordered the department to hire one mi\u00ad nority person of every three who qualified until at least 20 minority workers were on the staff:'lP In situations where the major element of discrimination was the use of unvalidated tests that adversely af\u00ad fected minorities, courts may order as an interim remedy that separate lists be established for white and minority eligibles and that hiring take place from the top of each list in a proportion established by the court. 40 As in the cases considered in Part I, it should be noted that the minority applicants benefited by orders involving numerical requirements may not be the same people against whom the employer or union discriminated in the past, although they are quite likely to have suffered discrimination in segregated schools or through other public action. As the court stated in the Rios case: 41 [W]here the burden is directly caused by past discriminatory practices it is readily apparent that if the rights of minority members had not been vio\u00ad lated many more of them would enjoy thos~ rights than presently do so and that the ratio of minority members enjoying such rights would be higher. The effects of such past violations of the minority's rights cannot be eliminated merely by prohibit\u00ad ing future discrimination, since this would be illu\u00ad sory and inadequate as a remedy.

While efforts to identify the \"rightful place\" that members of minority groups would occupy if dis\u00ad crimination had not occurred nre necessarily specula\u00ad tive, the most approprinte guide may be found in the Supreme Court's suggestion that absent discrimina\u00ad tion, it is to be expected that work forces will be \"more or less representative of the population in the community from which employees are hired.\" I~ On a practical as well as a legal Ie i'e!, decisions setting numerical requi:'''n1ents are also justified by the fact that they may provide the only meaningful point at whieh the law can intervene to provide opportunity for indivitlu'als who have been discriminated against by other im,titutions in the past. Although the decisions arc fairly uniform in ,;u~tllining the setting of numerical requirements for hiring WOI ~'~rs after discrimination has been found, the courts hav\\; had more difficulty in dealing with situations where numetical requirements would im\u00ad pinge on the status that nonminority workers have already attained. So, for example, in one case a court of appeals, while sustaining a numerical requirement for new hiring, harred a similar requirement for pro\u00ad motions on grounds that it would interfere with the established career expectancies of current em\u00ad ployees.'- In addition, in the current state of the law, it appears that the results of affirmative action pro\u00ad grams (including those embodying numerical re\u00ad quirements) may be undone when an employer followed an established seniority system in deciding which employees to layoff. H In part, these decisions may stem from the special solicitude manifested in Title VII for protecting seniority systems not tainted with illegal racial intent.

These figures, taken together as a combined score, are deemed a reasonable prediction of the likely performance of the applicant in his or her first year of professional schools. Nonetheless, a great deal of subjective judgment enters into the admissions process. The motivation and experience and other personal quali\u00ad ties of applicants are deemed important factors that cannot easily be quantified, but only assesscd through personal interviews and references. Otber policies of professional schools such as a desire to achieve geographical diversity or (for practical rca~ sons) to accord a preference to the children of alumni or contributors militate against the us\\> ,'f test and grade performance as the sole determinants for admissions. The form of affirmative admissions programs varies in important respects from institution to insti\u00ad tution,'\" but what is common to virtually all programs is a decision to use race as one' of the relevant factnrs in determining admissions. Universities continue to insist that all applicants selected be qualified, and the programs have not resulted in the selection of minority applicants deemed unlikely to succecd in school or in thz practice of the professions:1O From a pool of qualified applicants ordinarily far larger than the number of places available, the professional school selects some minority applicants whose com\u00ad bined scores (grade point average and aptitUde test) are lower than those of some mmminority applicants .. In some medical schools, for example, percentage goals have been established for minority students in entering classes; in some a separate group, usually including minority faculty or students, has been created to review the applica\u00ad tions of minority or disadvantaged students: in others, race is considered as a fnctor without th.:: setting of specific goals of the creation of a separate admissions group. See, Charles E. Odegaard, Millorities ill Medicille (New York: Mncy Foundation, 1977), Pro/essioll Scllools (1975), table vm. it While courts have differed in their views of the consti\u00ad tutionality of affirmative admissions progrnms, none ha\\ found reason to dispute the representation of the profes\u00ad sional schools that the minority students admitted were qunJified. See, DeFunis v. Odegaard, 82 Wnsh.2d 11, 416 312 Alevy Center, N.Y.2d 326. 348IN.E.2d 537 (1976); Bakke v. The Regents of the University of California, 18 Cal.3d 34, 553 P.2d 1152 132 Cal. Rptr. 680 (1976). 109 who arc not accepted. Invariably, because of other factOls weighed in the admissions process, some \\V'hite applicants arc also accepted whose scores arc lower than those of applicants who arc rejected. The challenge to special admissions programs is based on a belief, often strongly held, that it is both improper and violative of the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment for a public body to make distinctions based upon race. The harm perceived is the exclusion of applicants who are not members of the specially admitted group for reasons having nothing to do with their qualifications and the cast\u00ad ing of a shadow Oil the credentials of all minority admittccs whether their admission was attributable to a preference or not. Unquestionably, our jurisprudence requires that courts view racial classifications made by govern\u00ad mental laws and policies with suspicion and cor\u00ad rectly so, for on careful examination it has been found that most such classifications inflict harm upon people without justification.no It is not accurate, however, to conclude that all racinl distinctions arc groundless or unconstitutional. Contempol'aneously with pa'1sage of the 14th amendment, Congress en\u00ad acted a law authorizing the Freedmen's Bureau to extend special education aid and other benefits to black citizens. The law was enacted over the veto of President Andrew Johnson and after debates in which many of the opponents posed arguments simi\u00ad lar to those being raised currently against affirma\u00ad tive action programs.\"l Through the years. and par\u00ad ticularly in recent tilll/''>, Congl'ess has enacted laws extending certain types of assistance to designated racial groups on findings that these groups had spe\u00ad cial needs. Very recently, for example, Congress provided in the Public Works Employment Act of 1977 that a specified portion of public works grants ~'See, ('.g., McLaughlin v.

A useful summnry of the congressional debates is contained in the amiCIIS cllriae brief of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educntional Fund, Inc., in Regents of the Uni\u00ad versity of California v. Bakke (U.S. S. Ct., Oct. term, 1977 No. 76-811) must be set asideifor minority business enterprises.52 The issue, then, in assessing the soundness and constitutionality of affirmative action admissions programs is whether they meet the burden of special justification that generally falls upon public actions that make racial distinctions .. ~8 A careful and rea\u00ad soned consideration of this question in the courts has been impeded by the reluctance of most profes\u00ad sional schools to spread on tl;1e public record infor\u00ad mation on two subjects of great relevance: the past exclusionary practices of their own and other pro\u00ad fessional schools and the discriminatory activities of other public agencies in their own States. Since affirmative action admi!.sions programs have been undertaken voluntarily, university officials have not deemed it wise or prudent to make public adm.issions of the culpability of the government of which they are a part. Instead, thf.Y have offered a variety of other justifications for the affirmative consideration of race in the admissions process, among them: (a) the absence of minorities in any numbers in the pro\u00ad fession; (b) the benefits to students and the profes\u00ad sion of achieving diversity in the student body and the profession through the admission of minority ap\u00ad plicants; (c) the need to t:ain professionals who may serve as role models for younger minority people; (d) the need to train professionals who would serve the needs of the poor in minority communities by work\u00ad ing in those communities and encouraging other nonminority professionals to do so; and (e) the need to give.special consideration to minority appli\u00ad cants because,as a result\u00b7 of poor education and economic burdens, their numellcal scores do not necessarily reflect their abilities. 54 While all of these are factors with some degree of persuasive force, their strength as a justification for affirmative action admissions pl'ograms may be partly contingent upon the circumstances that gav\\., lise to the absence of minority professiona/.s in the first place, and a history of racial exclusion and. discrimination may be far n, Pub. L. 95-28. A compilation of such race-conscious laws and programs is contained in appendix A of the brie~ of the United States as amiclls curiae in the Bakke case. .. Some have argued that because affirmative action ad\u00ad missions programs are remedial in nature the burden of justification should be no more stringent than the \"rational purpose\" test applied in judging the constitutionality of most econo!TIic and social legislation. Without expressing a view on this legal question, We assume for purposes of this dis\u00ad cussion that public actions making racial distinctions of any kind must meet a stricter standard. \"See, e.g., Bakke v. Regents of the Univeristy of Ca!., 18 Cal. 3d 680, 553 P.2d 1152, 132 Cal. Rptr. 680 (1976). more persuasive than other factors taken individ\u00ad ually or collectively. There is no doubt about the history of racial ex.,. clusion in the professional schools. In 1948, one\u00ad third of the approved medical schools had official policies of denying black applicants admission solely on the basis of race. 55 Even after official policies of racial exclusion were abandoned, the number of black medical students remained very smal1. In 1969-70, black students were only 2.6 percent of the total enrollment of medical schools. Hispanics, during this same period, were 0.5' percent of medical school enrollment. 50 Law schools have a similar hi\"s\u00ad tory, many not having abandoned overt exclusion until after the Second World War. Most then moved to tokenism Fe I Women have suffered from similar policies. Schools have increased their minority and female enrollments only recently unaer' the spur of governmental policy and affirmative action admis\u00ad sions programs. Nor is it in serious dispute that a very substantial portion of minority students applying for profes\u00ad sional schools today have suffered racial discrimina\u00ad tion at the hands of school systems and other gov\u00ad ernment agencies. For example, in California, site of the Bakke case and generally regarded as a rela\u00ad tively progressive State in race relations, public school systems serving a majority of the' State's children have been found during the last decade to have deliberately segregated students because of their race in violation 0f the Federal or State constitutions or F~deral. civil rights statutes. 58 ~ther discrimina\u00ad tory practices have included the failure to offer lan- '\" See Johnson, \"History of the Education of Negro Phy\u00ad sicians,\" 42 Journal of Medical Education, 439, 441 (1967).

G9 In sum, whether or not university officials choose to articulate it, the fundamental justification for affirmative action admissions programs in profes\u00ad sional schools is identical to that which has led courts to uphold affirmative action, including numerically\u00ad based remedies, in employment.GO Such programs are designed to provide redress, however belated, for past practices of racial exclusion of the professional schools themselves. Equally as important, the pro~ grams are intended to provide opportunities that were denied to many applicants earlier in their lives and that may be foreclosed forever if affirmative action is not permitted to intervene.lll In their impact on nonminorities, the programs of professional schools are similar to the affirmative redress that has been provided in employment cases involving new hiring, in that the effect is not on benefits already accrued by nonminorities but upon their expectations. Although the disappointment of .. See Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563 {l974) involving Chinese-speaking children in San Francisco whose families had reoently immigrated to the United States and sustain\u00ad ing a finding of a violation of Title VI of the 1964 act. In addition, a substantial number of young people in California were born in Southern States and attended public schools at a time when the racially dual systems had not been dismantled. The legal issues in the two sets of cases, while not idan\u00ad tical, are closely parallel. It is true that the results in em\u00ad ployment cases are undergirded in part by the approval that Congress has given in Title VII and elsewhere to the con\u00ad cept of affirmatiVe action and that Congress has authority under the Constitution to expand definitions of the right to equal treatment. See, e.g .. South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301 (1966). But it is equally true th,.t the Supreme Court has given broad scope to the States in ,taking volun\u00ad tary action to promote equality, even when the action is race conscious and is not explicitly designed to remedy a constitutional wrong. See, e.g., Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklen\u00ad burg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1 (1971), where the Court said that State officials may choose to balance racially public schools even where such schools have not been deliberately segregated. And it would be ironic in the ex\u00ad treme if the deference accorded to States during the many years when they countenanced the denial of rights of racial minorities were to be withdrawn now that some States are seeking to redress thek past failures. It is true, as in employment, that some members of the minority groups benefited by the program may not have suffered discrimination. But as the Justice Department has noted, it would bean extram'dinarily difficult task to require professional schools to substitute for their present programs a case-by-case examination of the impact of diSCrimination on each minority applicant. Of course, some minority ap\u00ad plicants now gain entry to professional schools without the assistance of affirmative admissions programs. ' 111 expectations ought not to be discounted, it may weigh less heavily than an actual loss of benefits and the reasonableness of the expectations must be examined. It is said that race-conscious admissions programs may have a particularly detrimental effect on the prospects for admission of members of other ethnic groups who have had to overcome adverse socioeconomic circumstances to qualify 'for profes\u00ad sional careers.02 But professional schools have pur-\u00b7 ported for several years to take into account in the admissions process the potential shown by those' who have attained academic success in the face of conditions of poverty or other difficult circumstances. To the extent that they have failed to do so ade\u00ad quately, the remedy lies not in eliminating programs to redress governmentally-fostered discrimination, but in increased sensitivity {-and financial aid) to applicants who have overcome other forms of ad\u00ad versity; Nor is there evidence that the reasonable expecta\u00ad tions of white applicants have been disappointed in other ways. Professional schools have never held out the promise that admission would be extended auto .. matically to those with the highest grades and test scores in disregard of all other factors. Moreover, during the period when affirmative action admis\u00ad sions programs have been in operation, governme!1ts have expanded the number of places in professional schools dramatically. The great bulk of these new opportunities has gone to white applicants.on The practical effect of affirmative action admissions pro\u00ad grams has been to assure that minority applicants, long foreclosed by racial discrimination from all but token participation, would receive a share of these new opportunities. '\" The distinction drawn in most programs is between groups that historically were explicitly held by government to be second-class citizens and that have continued to suffer discrimitlation at the hands of government (blacks, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and American Indians) and other groups (e.g\" Americans of Eastern European descent) that have suffered other forms of discrimination. A brief summary of officially imposed racism against Indians, His\u00ad panic Americans, and Asian Americans is contained in Derrick A. Bell, Race, Racism and America/! Law (Boston: Little, Brown, 1973), pp. 59-82. o. While the enrollment of black students in first-year medical classes increased 180 percent from 1968 to 1976, the actm.l number of new students is quite small, since blacks were only 2.7 percent of first-year students in 1968. White enrollment during this period increased 49 percent, representing a much greater number of students. See New York Times, Sept. 12, 1977, p. 32. Part III. Conclusion The aspiration of the American people is for a \"colorblind\" society, one that \"neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.\" 04 But color con\u00ad sciousness is unavoidable while the effects persist of decades of governmentally-imposed racial wrongs. A society that, in the name of the ideal, foreclosed raciaIIy-conscious remedies would not be truly color\u00ad blind but morally blind. The concept of affirmative action has arisen from this inescapable conclusion. The justification for affirmative action to secure equal access to the job market lies in the need to overcome the effects of past discrimination by the employers, unions, col\u00ad leges, and universities who .He asked to undertake such action. It rests also in the practical need to assure tflat young people whose lives have been marred by discrimination in public education and other institutions are not forever barred from the opportunity to realiL:e their potential and to become useful and productive citizens. The test of affirmative action programs is whether they are well calculated to achieve these objectives and whether or not they do so in a way that deals fairly with the rights and interests of all citizens. While care must bc taken to safeguard against abuses, we believe that affirmative action as applied in the variety of contexts examined in this statement, including those where numericaIIy\u00ad based remedies have been employed, meets this fundamental standard. Affirmative action programs have been in effect in. mo~t i~stances for less than a decade, an eye\u00ad blink In history when compared with the centuries of oppression that preceded them. The gains ~e~ured thus far have been modest and fragile. Yet It IS now contended that the civil rights laws of the 1960s and the gains that flowed to some individuals render affirmative action of the kind now undertaken unjustified as \"special favoritism.\" In this challenge there are echoes of a Supreme Court decision almost a century old: 'Yhen man has emerged from slavery and by the ~Id of beneficent legislation has sh~ken off the Inseparable concomitants of that state there must be some state in the progress of his elevation when he takes the rank of a mere citizen and ceases to be the special favorite of the laws.05 The Supreme Court's decision in 1883 that that \"state of progress\" had been reached heralded the \"'.Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 559 (1896) (Harlan. J. dIssenting). ' ... Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3, 25 (1883). 12 cnd . of efforts to deal with the consequences of slavery ~nd helped usher in the era of enforced segregation and discrimination that has persisted throughout most of this century. A new decision implying that in 1977 this nation has reathed a state of progress sufficient to justify the abandonment of any significant component of a~nnative action programs would have similarly disastrous consequences. Such a decision could only be reached by ignoring the crushing burden of unem\u00ad ployment, poverty, and discrimination facing black people and others whose skins are dark. The aban\u00ad donment of affirmative action programs, of which numerical goals are an integral part, would shut out many thousands of minority students and minority and women workers from opportunities that have only recently become available to them.oo The short history of affirmative action pror\"ams has shown such programs to be promising instru\u00ad ments in obtaining equality of opportunity. Many thousands of people have been afforded opportunities to develop their talents fully-opportunities that would not have been available without affirmative action. The emerging cadre of able minority and women lawyers, doctors, construction workers, and office managers is testimony to the fact that when opportunities are provided they will be used to the fullest. While the effort often poses hard choices, courts and public agencies have shown themselves to be sensitive to the need to protect the legitimate inter\u00ad ests and expectations of white workers and students and the interests of employers and universities in preserving systems based on merit. While all prob\u00ad lems have not been resolved, the means are at hand to create employment and education systems that are fair to all people. It would be a tragedy if this nation repeated the error that was made a century ago. If we do not lose our nerve and commitment and if we call upon the reservoir of good wiII that exists in this nation, affirmative action programs will help us to reach the day when our society is truly colorblind and nonsexist because all people will have an equal opportunity to develop their full potential and to share in the effort and the rewards that such develop\u00ad ment brings. 6C As to minorities in law school admissions, see Law School Admis~ion ReseQlch : Applications und Aamission to AHA Accented J;.aw.

Some of it has been dispassionate but much has been deeply charged with emotion. The legal interest in Bakke is clear. The basis of the case is the charge by Allan Bakke, a white man, that he was discriminated against because of his race when he was denied admission to the Medical School of the University of California at Davis while minority students with lesser credentials in the form of grades and test scores were admitted under a quota system. The Supreme Court will decide whether or not the special admissions program at Davis violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The acute interest of academic institutions is equally clear. The case is widely seen as a test of their right to pursue policies of affirmative action in general and specifically to give consideration to a person's race in their ad\u00ad missions policies and procedures. Those admissions policies and procedures exert a powerful and often controlling influence on who may enter certain critical occupations and practice certain professions in this country. Thus they control access to positions of influence and of high economic and social reward. The broad interest of the whole society is powerfully affected. It was not the Council's purpose to address the constitutionai issue in Bakke. Rather, we considered the questions of public policy and of academic policy that are at issue and have outlined broad boundaries within which we believe lie many acceptable courses of action for institutions of higher edu\u00ad cation. We believe these courses of action meet the tests of constitutionality, respect individual rights, and fully recognize pressing societal obligations to put an end to racial discrimination. We also believe they will promote the institutions' educational ends. We have sought a \"golden mean\" that draws on several American ideals, rather than on one alone; that rejects no basic American ideal in its entirety in the name of some other. We have not dis\u00ad covered a panacea, nor do we favor a single approach to the complex matter of admissions policy: quite the contrary, as we will try to make clear. This paper summarizes the major conclusions expressed by the Council in a book (Selective Admissions in Higher Education) forthcoming from Jossey\u00ad Bass, San Francisco. The first part of the full report contains the Carnegie Council's comments and recommendations. The second and third parts of the report were prepared by Winton H. Manning and by Warren Willingham. and Hunter Breland, all of Educational Testing Service, who were asked by the Council to prepare an analysis of critical issues and a summary of essen\u00ad tial facts in admissions today. POSITION OF THE CARNEGIE COUNCIL To address the principal issue immediately: the position of the Carnegie Council is that the racial experience of an academically admissible applicant -one who meets the impartial academic standards required for successful completion of college or university work-is among the criteria relevant to admissions decisions. In speaking of racial experience, we would include not 114 only the experience of members of racial groups, bllt also that of persons raised in non-English-speaking homes. Race not only may but should be considered in the final selection where. in the case of an individual, his or her racial idelltl'ty reflects prior adverse circumstances. a promise to con\u00ad tribute to the educational experience of other students or to the diversity of services to be provided to society. THE RELEVANCE OF RACE IN ADlVlISSIONS Admissions policy for selective schools has long been a concern within higher education. The problem is particularly acute in the case of schools that serve as virtually the sole avenue of entry into such professions as medicine and law, and that collectively turn away more students than they admit. We are concerned here with what is good public policy and what is good academic policy governing such admissions. and how the two may best be reconciled if their requirements diverge. A. PubUc Policy The public has a clear interest in access to higher education. This interest begins with the creation of places for students. Historically. direct and in\u00ad direct support from the public purse has made possible the American system of colleges. universities. and professional schools and maintains that system today. One reason for this investment of public funds is to train people for professional and other specialized positions vital to the well-being of the entire society. The public thus has a special interest in the criteria used in filling the selective places; in particular, in assuring that they be filled on the basis of fair and reasonable institutional policies and procedures, and that no one is subject to discrimination on the basis of race or sex or religion or ethnic origin. The public interest has another dimension. Schools which largely deter\u00ad mine, through their admissions practices. the composition of the professions. and thus the services available to society, should not knowingly admit-and should never confer degrees upon-persons who they believe will be incom\u00ad petent in practicing the profession; otherwise the consumers of their services may be injured. These schools should also make every effort to admit and to graduate persons who will meet the diversified needs of a heterogeneous. pluralistic nation. Individuals with potential talent from all segments of society should have a fair chance to rise to positions of leadership both in simple justice to them and in service of the need for leaders, models of ad- 115 vancement, and mentors for those in comparable life circumstances who aspire to similar education and careers. The need is especially urgent within those grou ps deprived of such opportunities in the past. Higher education carries a great affirmative responsibility to advance this dimension of the general welfare. The professional schools that yield many of our community, regional, and national leaders stand in a very special position today to make effective in practice the most fundamental principles of the American nation while at the same time meeting the individual's claims to equal protection. B. Academic Polley The admissions policies of institutions of higher education are varied and complex. In one way or another, perhaps 60 percent of all admissions are selective. Combining the degree of selectivity and the choice of the weighting of considerations, the possible admissions policies are almost infinite in number. For selective institutions the composition of their student bodies is of great, sometimes dominating, importance, and is the major source of their contributions to society. The United States prides itself on the great diversity of its colleges, on the lack of conformity among them. This diversity offers students a wide range of choices while providing to society graduates with a broad range of train\u00ad ing and academic experience. Consequently, colleges should have, and his\u00ad torically have had, very substantial autonomy in setting their own admissions policies. Restraints should be imposed on that autonomy only when there exists a substantial public interest that cannot be served in other ways. In their admissions practices, selective institutions variously take into account prior scholastic grades, test scores, special abilities (peer group leadership, athletic ability, etc.), special personal characteristics (such as proven ability to rise above obstacles, including language barriers, poor prior schooling, or physical handicaps), potential contributions to a profes\u00ad sion (shown, for example, by interest in serving in a neglected area or spe\u00ad cialty). Such institutions also look at characteristics that will contribute to the diversity of the student body-for example, by state or nation of origin, by parental occupation or income, by cultural background. They often choose to build academic and social communities through their admissions policies. Because students learn from each other, these communities are themselves educational mechanisms. Grades and test scores, taken together, have a predictive value greater than grades alone or tests alone. A considerable body of evidence indicates that test scores are equally predictive for minority and majority students. While grades and scores are sufficiently predictive to be very useful in selec\u00ad tive admissions. they are not, however, sufficient as a sole basis for decision. They are best at identifying at one end of the spectrum those applicants who are likely to distinguish themselves academically and at the other end those likely to fail-and failure is costly to the student and to the institution. They are insufficient particularly for determining the admission of a great many persons found between these extremes. The selective professional schools must exercise particular care not to admit students who lack the ability to practice the professions with compe- 116 I , I tency and integrity. They must also be conscious of the need to supply grad\u00ad uates who will meet the varied .teeds of the profession. These schools there\u00ad fore have a quite legitimate interest in special persons with special charac\u00ad teristics-for example. those who have shown a strong interest in community service. or those who have shown they can face adversity and conquer if' through the force of their own personalities-for these characteristics relate directly to potential service within the profession. Different professional schools will. of course, look for different things. related to the emphasis in their own instructional programs. The complex and sensitive decision pro\u00ad cess calls for judgment. It does not lend itself to easy mechanical solutions. \"'''''''''''''''''''''' Public and academic policy could diverge if. for example. public policy were to lead to a lowering of academic standards. or if it interfered too greatly with professional judgments; or if academic policy obstructed affirmative action or was not otherwise fair and reasonable. But they need not diverge. The challenges are to apply public policy without undue interference with academic judgments and concerns. and for institutions to satisfy public policy without loss of academic standards. C. Recommecdations for Public Policy and for Academic Policy We turn now to our specific suggestions for policy affecting admissions to selective schools at both the undergraduate and graduate levels: 1. These schools should adhere to a policy of affirmative action in educa\u00ad tional practices: (a) No policies or practices may discriminate against members of groups subject to discrimination (b) Special efforts should be made to recruit members of these groups (c) Compensatory education should be available to such persons when necessary (d) Special financial assistance and counseling should be provided when needed,and (e) Goals may be set against which progress can be measured. 2. Race or background in a non-English-Ianguage home should be eligible for consideration in individual cases where it (a) reflects prior adverse dis\u00ad crimination. or (b) contributes to prior educational disadvantage. or (c) involves direct knowledge of special cultural patterns and experiences. or (d) indicates. along with other evidence, the probability of subsequent provisions of specially needed services to society. The first and second considerations (a and b) are based on the principles of equality of treat\u00ad ment and equality of opportunity. the third (c) on institutional interest in diversity in the student community. and the fourth (d) on the needs of society for service. We emphasize racial experience. not race per set and experience in a non-English-Iangl!age home. not heritage or surname per se. Thus we say in individual cases. Most persons with a minority racial background or raised in a non-English-language home now have special characteristics which we believe warrant consideration; not all do-some have not expe- 111 rienced prior adverse social discrimination. have not been educationally disadvantaged. have had little or no contact with a minority culture, and have no interest in special services to society. Race or other minority status should be only one of several dimensions considered as aspects of prior disadvantage or adverse discrimination. as one of several indicators of prospective contributions to the diversity and quality of the academic experience for other students. and as one of sev\u00ad eral intimations of intention to serve society in neglected areas. Thus in\u00ad dividuals from the majority group may also warrant special consideration dependin~ upon their background cir~umstances. 3. No student should be admitted who cannot meet the general academic standards set for all students, through assessment of prior grades and test scores, as the minimum level at which there is a reasonable chance of success in completing the course work without reduction in academic or professional standards. Race, or other minority status, or sex, or age is clearly not a consideration here. 4. No numerical quota for any component should be liet, but rather goals should be established that may change over time as conditions change and may be exceeded or remain unmet depending on the composition of the body of applicants in anyone year. S. Financial aid should be provided to students from low-income families to attract them in sufficient numbers into the \"pool\" of applicants within which choices will be made. 6. All applicants should be processed through the same set of procedures to assure that they are looked at together and not separately, that an effective student body is being assembled and not separate quotas being met, and that each person is being evaluated on his or her own merits. 7. Procedures should call for the application of professional judgment by members of the faculty. In the absence of fully objective criteria, applica\u00ad tion of professional judgment is the best available approach. 8. Schools should be given maximum latitude in exercising their judgments about the admission of individual students with respect for the profes\u00ad sional expertise involved in the judgments, for the complexity of the char\u00ad acteristics desired in the students, for the detailed and changing needs for graduates of the programs in different localities served, and in consid\u00ad eration of the wisdom of encouraging diversity among the schools. 9. The judgment of courts, or legislatures,. or government officials should not replace professional judgment except when clearly required by the public interest. Rigid and simplistic formulas externally imposed should, in any event. be avoided. Student bodies should be chosen on a multi\u00ad dimensional basis and not as the result of a unidimensional contest to be won or lost on the basis of a single (and imprecise) measure. We are suggesting, then, a two-stage model of the admissions process. Selective graduate and professional schools, like many selective colleges, not o,lly have many more applicants than they can admit, but they have many more qualified applicants than they can enroll. Accordingly, many selective institutions make an effort, first, to eliminate from consideration those appli- 118 j cants who do not meet some minimal standard of admissibility and then to focus their efforts on the difficult task of selecting a class from the still large pool of qualified applicants. The distinction between these two decisions\u00ad admissibility and selection-is an important one, especially in the context of Bakke. Our contention is that minimal standards should be set no higher than is necessary to make decisions concerning adm\"ssibility, and should be applied uniformly to all applicants. Considerations of race, sex, ethnicity, or other categorical indexes have no place in admissibility decisions; however, such considerations are a ppropriate in the second stage of the admissions process -selection. The central social and educational issue of the Bakke case is the problem of balancing consideration of individual and group equity-a problem which turns upon difficult value choices. Not all individuals and not all institutions will agree about them. III this circumstance, the public l11ust have access to the policies to be followed by an institution and must have confidence in the process by which decisions are made. The selective professional schools in particular must be prepared to face public scrutiny of their processes and their policies; and both the processes and the policies should conform to their own missions and to the demands of public policy, an~ should be fair as among individuals similarly situated. Above all. these schools must be concerned with making optimal use of their facilities to develop human re\u00ad sources for service to society. In the effort to reach this goal, racl'al experience is relevant within the admissions process because important educational and professional objectives will not be attainable unless, as colleges and uni\u00ad versities go about the task of making admissions decisions, considetationis given to the minority status of individual "}
