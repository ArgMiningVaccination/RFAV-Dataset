Medications not administered properly can have serious consequences including: Significant injury to major organs such as the kidneys or liver Death September 2019 Safety, Oversight and Quality Unit 69/11/2019 3INTRODUCTION CONTINUED The AFH rules require that AFH owners and their caregivers are able to demonstrate they: Understand why the medication is being taken Know how the medication is expected to work Know the potential side effects of the medication Understand any resident specific instructions September 2019 Safety, Oversight and Quality Unit 7 ALERT All substitute caregivers must have training on how to administer medications properly and knowledge of each residents medications BEFORE they administer any medication. September 2019 Safety, Oversight and Quality Unit 8 AGE-RELATED CHANGES Normal aging alters medication absorption and elimination, which means the action of many medications in the elderly is less predictable than in younger adults: Each person reacts differently to medication therapy Age-related changes can cause changes in how the person reacts to the medication in part due to: Natural decline in kidney and liver function; or Damage to kidney or liver function due to disease or other causes September 2019 Safety, Oversight and Quality Unit 99/11/2019 4AGE-RELATED CHANGES CONTINUED Decline in gastrointestinal function. Result: Medication absorption is delayed More body fat than muscle. Result: Because fatty tissue stores some medications, unpredictable and delayed medication action may occur Lower body weight in older adults. Result: Normal adult dosage may cause overdose -fewer medications are required with low body weight September 2019 Safety, Oversight and Quality Unit 10 AGE-RELATED CHANGES CONTINUED Age-related changes affecting the action of medications include: Decrease in volume of blood and water in the body. Result: Medication is distributed throughout the body in a more concentrated form Decrease in liver and kidney function. Result: The organs are slower in breaking down and eliminating medication Medications remain active in the body longer and may build to toxic levels September 2019 Safety, Oversight and Quality Unit 11 MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION SYSTEM A medication administration system includes: Obtaining medical orders Transcribing medical orders on to the medication administration record (MAR) Verifying medical orders against the MAR Dispensing and delivering/administering Monitoring and documenting Storing Disposing of discontinued, unused, contaminated or expired medication Re-ordering medications September 2019 Safety, Oversight and Quality Unit 129/11/2019 5MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION SYSTEM CONTINUED When dispensing medications all caregivers must use infection control procedures, including: Proper hand washing techniques: Wash hands before and after administering medications for each resident Wear gloves when appropriate administering: Topical medications CBG testing Subcutaneous injections September 2019 Safety, Oversight and Quality Unit 13 MEDICAL ORDERS The resident's healthcare provider or specialist (prescriber) is responsible for approving all medications and treatments: A written order or prescription for all medications Treatments, therapies and any special diet requirements Written approval for over-the-counter (OTC), supplements and herbal treatments requested by the resident September 2019 Safety, Oversight and Quality Unit 14 WHO CAN PRESCRIBE?

Medications include: Prescription medications \u2014prescribed by a medical professional and dispensed through a pharmacy Over-the-counter medications (OTC) \u2014can be purchased without a prescription, including: Cold remedies, aspirin etc. Alternative medications \u2014 herbal remedies such as Saint John's Wart, nutritional supplements such as Ensure, and vitamins Home remedies September 2019 Safety, Oversight and Quality Unit 16 ALERT No matter the type of medication, the risk for a medication interaction increases with each additional medication the person takes. September 2019 Safety, Oversight and Quality Unit 17 THERAPEUTIC EFFECT All medications have a therapeutic effect known as desired effects. Examples include: Pain relief from pain medication Reduced high blood pressure from blood pressure medication Maintenance of appropriate blood sugar levels in diabetes Reduced psychotic symptoms in psychiatric conditions September 2019 Safety, Oversight and Quality Unit 189/11/2019 7SIDE EFFECTS Side effects may be desirable or undesirable. Examples of undesirable effects (not intended) include: An antihistamine (allergy medication) may stop you from sneezing and having a runny nose, but it may also make you sleepy An antacid may relieve stomach irritation and discomfort, but may cause: Constipation Interference with the effectiveness of other medications September 2019 Safety, Oversight and Quality Unit 19 SIDE EFFECTS CONTINUED Side effects may be: Minor and may not interfere with the individual's quality of life; or Can be enough of a problem that it interferes with the person's quality of life The AFH provider is expected to document all side effects and work with the resident's healthcare provider if side effects negatively impact the resident September 2019 Safety, Oversight and Quality Unit 20 ALERT Do not minimize an individual's complaints regarding side effects. What may seem insignificant to you can be significant to someone else. Side effects are frequently the reason people stop taking their medications. September 2019 Safety, Oversight and Quality Unit 219/11/2019 8ADVERSE MEDICATION (DRUG) REACTION (ADR) An adverse medication (drug) reaction(ADR) is a less common or unexpected effect that generally means a medication is not right for that person: Severity can range from moderate to extremely serious An ADR can occur soon after beginning a medication rit can take weeks or months to appear. September 2019 Safety, Oversight and Quality Unit 22 ADR CONTINUED ADR must be: Reported to the prescriber immediately; and Documented in the resident's record Examples of ADRs: Sedation/insomnia (sleepiness) Confusion Unsteady gait Blurred vision September 2019 Safety, Oversight and Quality Unit 23 ADR CONTINUED Movement disorders Memory loss Rash Agitation, anxiety Seizures Stomach ulcers or bleeding Incontinence Hallucinations September 2019 Safety, Oversight and Quality Unit 249/11/2019 9SIDE EFFECTS AND ADRs Side effects and adverse medication reactions (ADRs) can be subtle and hard to identify. For example: A red, bumpy rash from head to toe would be a clear indication of an adverse medication reaction It would be harder to identify an ADR if the same person stopped reading the newspaper due to blurred vision September 2019 Safety, Oversight and Quality Unit 25 SIDE EFFECTS AND ADRs CONTINUED Side effects and ADRs often go unnoticed or are misdiagnosed in seniors: Physical reactions such as fatigue, falling or weight loss that may be mistaken as \"normal\" aging Symptoms may be mistaken for decline of an existing health condition or a new health condition May mimic diseases such as the confusion associated with dementia or Alzheimer's disease September 2019 Safety, Oversight and Quality Unit 26 ALERT Consider any sudden change in an older adult's physical ability or personality, especially after beginning a new medication, to be an adverse medication reaction until proven otherwise. September 2019 Safety, Oversight and Quality Unit 279/11/2019 10MEDICATION INTERACTIONS A medication interaction is when one medication changes or alters the function of another medication. This includes: Pharmacy-dispensed medications Medications purchased over-the-counter Alternative medications and supplements Home remedies Foods and beverages can also interact with medications September 2019 Safety, Oversight and Quality Unit 28 MEDICATION INTERACTIONS CONTINUED Medication interactions include: Medication to medication: Calcium supplement can reduce the effectiveness of medications used to treat low thyroid levels; or Two different medications that cause drowsiness can significantly increase the risk of injury or falls September 2019 Safety, Oversight and Quality Unit 29 MEDICATION INTERACTIONS CONTINUED Medication to food or beverage: Grapefruit juice and fresh grapefruit can increase the amount of active ingredient for certain medications leading to increased adverse medication reactions Medication to disease: An existing medical condition can make certain medications potentially harmful -for example someone with liver damage may have to restrict or avoid acetaminophen or other medications that can be harmful to the liver September 2019 Safety, Oversight and Quality Unit 309/11/2019 11MEDICATION INTERACTIONS CONTINUED Seniors, persons with chronic health conditions or developmental or physical disabilities are at higher risk for medication-related problems: Taking several medications increases the risk for an adverse reaction One or more chronic conditions \u2014such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and arthritis \u2014can affect how a medication works in the body September 2019 Safety, Oversight and Quality Unit 31 ACCESS TO INFORMATION Caregivers must have immediate availability to medication references, such as: Online resources: medications.com Current medication reference: Updated medication reference books are generally available annually in October/November Current product inserts or medication summary Must replace each time a refill is picked up; AND Each time an OTC is purchased September 2019 Safety, Oversight and Quality Unit 32 MEDICATION ERRORS Medications are used to treat disease and ease discomfort or pain.
