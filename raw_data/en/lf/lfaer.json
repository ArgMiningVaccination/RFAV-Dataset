Introduction The Regional Office for South East Asia (SEARO ) held the first \"Regional Consultation for the Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Rights\" in accordance with the terms of the World Health Assembly Resolution (WHA) 61.21 on 5-6 April 2011. WHA61.21 outlines the Global Strategy on Public health, Innovation and intellectual property, the Global Strategy and Pla n of Action (GSPA) that aims to promote new thinking on innovation and access to medicines and medical products. The overall objective of the Regional Consultation was to enhance unde rstanding of GSPA and identify regional and national priorities for future action. Thirty five p a r t i c i p a n t s f r o m n i n e M e m b e r S t a t e s o f t h e South-East Asia Region, all except participants from DPR Korea and Timor-Leste, joined the Regional Consultation. B. Project management by the World Health Organization The Regional Consultation was inaugurated by Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Deputy Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region, who we lcomed the participants and read out the address by the Regional Director, Dr Samlee Pli anbangchang. The objectives of the Regional Consultation were outlined by Dr Athula Kahandaliyanage, Director Health Systems and Development Department. The background, co ntext and expected outcomes from the Regional Consultation were outlined by Dr Ma nisha Shridhar who drew attention to templates in this regard prepared and circulated by WHO-SEARO in advance for eliciting detailed responses from Member States on regional and na tional priorities for the eight main elements and 25 sub-elements of the GSPA. The represen tative from Bangladesh, Maj.-Gen. Md Abul Kalam Azad was nominated Chairperson for the proceedings and Mr Trihono from Indonesia was the Rapporteur. In order to develop a regional and national conceptual framework on public health, innovation and intellectual property and incorpor ate into it the perspective for the SEA Region, technical presentations were made on the following: a. Study of Micro, Small and Medium Enterp rises Census data for Ascertaining Access to Technical Know how in Pharmaceutical, Traditional Medicines, Dental and Medical Technology Enterprises to meet Public Health Needs in India. b. Challenges in GSPA deliverables for the Indian pharmaceutical industry after the experience of Trade Related Aspects of In tellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). c. The new Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) regime and access to medicines based on experiences from Sri Lanka: Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page ix On developing regional and national prioriti es the participants from Member states of Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand made presentations on the relevance of GSPA and their expectations from WHO-SEARO in this regard. This was followed by group work sessions in which the participants from Member states participated and arrived at a consensus over priority action points on eigh t main elements and 25 sub-elements of GSPA (see page 15 ). C. Conclusions The eight main elements and 25 sub-elements o f G S P A w e r e i d e n t i f i e d a s i m p o r t a n t parameters defining future focus areas for publ ic health, innovation and intellectual property. The Member states identified pr iority action points for WHO-SEARO and national priorities on GSPA, WHA 61.21. D. Recommendations For Member States (1) Institute a National Expert Committee fo r discussion on the GSPA and policy development on IPR and public health. T hose Member states which already have some commission or regulatory body in place need to put GSPA on the agenda for discussion. (2) Member states develop capacity for negoti ations in public health, Innovation and IPR with the required assistance from WHO. (3) Member States develop an appropriate and suitable legal framework under IPT with assistance from WHO. (4) Member states ensure representation fr om their Health Ministries in trade negotiations. (5) Member states should support funding for research and development (R&D) in neglected priority diseases (6) Member states should promote domestic in dustries to enhance their capacity to conduct relevant R&D and meet the need of affordable medicines and medical technologies for public health. For WHO (1) In view of its importance in public health, WHO-SEARO must facilitate Member states to establish focal points for public health, innovation and intelectual property rights. (2) WHO must collect information on patents an d other relevant databases and play an active role in enhancing understanding on th ese as well as facilitate sharing of patent information and other relevant data bases related to public health. Report of a Regional Consultation Page x (3) WHO should provide help to Member stat es in capacity building on intellectual property and trade (IPT) (4) WHO should ensure that mechanisms be developed so that states which have made substantial progress can share information an d benefits with other statesand promote regional networking and capacity building on public health, innovation and IPT for Member states. (5) WHO should provide technical assistance and financial support to Member states for IPT in public health. (6) WHO should build partnerships with othe r international organizations to address IPT and public health with a focus on access to medicines and essential technologies. (7) WHO should analyze IPT information for gaps in R&D on major diseases in the Region and also analyze the gaps in the tr eatment of these diseases in the Region. (8) WHO should endeavour to seek new strategies for affordable medicines and for promoting downstream R&D and production of medicines as public goods (9) WHO should develop and seek new strategies and new financial resources for R&D. (10) WHO should provide support to ensure that Member states' standards and requirements for safety and quality of health products are met. (11) WHO should assist the Member states to prepare plans for regional technology platforms with a view to strengthen their capacities for delivery, manufacture and innovation using regional expertise. (12) WHO should share information on IP filings and grants to maximize the \"Freedom To Operate (FTO)\" by researchers in the Region. (13) WHO should help organize consultations of this kind to enhance the capabilities of Member States in IPT, Innovations and Public Health, aspects much needed in the current globalized, trade oriented international environment.

Introduction In May 2003 the World Health Assembly (W HA) set up an independent Commission for analyzing the relationship between intellectua l property rights (IPRs), innovation and public health Commission on Intellectual Prop erty Rights, Innovation and Public Health (CIPIH)1. Member States in WHO have emphasized the importance of analyzing public health in international treaties in a manner that does not limit the production of particular drugs or the access to them 2. The interdependence of trade and he alth is increasingly evident in a globalized world. Various international trade agreements have brought out new challenges in the area of management of pu blic health. These involve agreements among Member States themselves, e.g. free trade area (FTA) agreements, and those involving international organizations. There are a nu mber of World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements that affect public health, e.g. Tr ade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), agreements on Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) and Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT). The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations has collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) over the FAO/WHO Conference on Food Standards, Chemicals in Food and Food. This has ensured fair practices in food trade and the development of food standards which have had an impact on consumer health and safety 3. The Doha Declaration of the World Trade organization (WTO) recognizes flexibilities in the application of TRIPS to protect public health4. The resulting CIPIH report (2006) made im portant observations on the status of innovation, IPR and the pharmaceutical industry. This led to the creation of an Intergovernmental Working Group (IGWG) to discuss a medium-term Global Strategy and Plan of Action (GSPA) 5 on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property.

The GSPA has identified about 100 action points across eight elements that cut across various sectors. Developing the SEA Regional Framework for GSPA The Sixty-third Session of the WHO Regional Committee for South-East Asia held in Bangkok, Thailand, on 7-10 September 2010 requested WHO to support Member States to build capacity in understanding the impl ications of international trade and trade agreements for health 7. In the SEA Region, relevant GSPA issues need to be addressed through policies and legislation that take advantage of the potential opportunities that may arise and also consider the potential challenges for health that trade and trade agreements may pose in this Region8. This is particularly important in the case of medicines and diagnostic devices where qualit y, safety and efficacy are major concerns and in which trade agreements create obligations. 2. General objectives of the Regional Consultation The general objective of the Regional Consultation was to develop a Regional and National Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property. 3. Specific Objectives of the Regional Consultation The specific objectives of the Regional Consultation were to: (1) enhance understanding of GSPA in South-East Asia Region; and (2) identify National and Regional priority areas under GSPA. 4. Inaugural session Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Deputy Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region, welcomed the participants to the Regional Consultation and delivered the inaugural address of the Regional Director. She obse r v e d t h a t w e l i v e i n a n i n c r e a s i n g l y interdependent world where various national and international policies and agreements have led to direct and indirect challenges posed to the management of public and human health. Among the WTO agreements that direct ly affect health and health policies, the http://www.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA59/A59_R24-en.pdf 6 61st World Health Assembly Resolution WHA61.21 Global Strategy and Plan of Action on Public Health, Innovation, and Intellectual Property. 7 Resolution SEA/RC63/R6 8 Resolution 59.26; 27 May 2006) Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page 3 Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intelle ctual Property Rights (TRIPS) has had far- reaching consequences on access to medical products, medicines and medical technologies for the developing world. TRIPS requires WTO Members to comply with certain minimum standards for protecting and en forcing intellectual property rights. As a result of concerns on access to medici nes, Member States of the World Trade Organization adopted the 2001 Doha Minister ial Declaration on Public Health, which enunciated that TRIPS should not prevent Members States from taking measures to protect public health and promote access to medicines for all. Due to compliance requirements with TR IPS, awareness about the importance of intellectual property rights, particularly patents, has become crucial for the countries of the Region. Health authorities often find it difficult to keep up with the evolving and intricate developments in this area, which fa ll outside the scope of their normal area of work and responsibility. More important, nati onal health authorities are concerned that some provisions in free trade agreements may go beyond WTO mandates. These extend patent protection for medicines, restrict the grounds for compulsory licenses and establish \"data exclusivity\" (protection of clinical trial data), making it difficu lt for generic medicines to be supplied. The Regional Director's message underlin ed that developing countries have an apprehension that other WTO agreements su ch as the Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) may be employed to set up non-tariff barriers to protect domestic sectors in developed countries, by using human, animal or plant health as an excuse to restrict access to their markets. Such measures could negate benefits from reduced tariffs and subsidies obtained in tr ade negotiations. On the other hand, there remain significant challenges for many countrie s in the SEA Region to create or strengthen regulatory systems required to guide health-related trade in the desired direction, and to develop standards necessary to ensure quality and protect consumer and patient safety. The General Agreement on Trade in Servic es (GATS) is the first multilateral agreement dealing with trade in services. Mi n i s t r i e s o f h e a l t h i n S E A R e g i o n f a c e numerous challenges in accurately assessing the risks and opportunities of trade in health services, and identifying poli c y m e a s u r e s t h a t c a n b e u s e d t o e n s u r e q u a l i t y a n d accessibility of medical products. The provisio n of health services across borders is also relevant for our countries. In order to address these issues, the Worl d Health Assembly set up a Commission on Intellectual Property Rights, Innovation and Public Health (CIPIH) in 2003 to examine the challenges in the way meeting the goal of ensuring access and innovation for needed health products and medical devices. This cu lminated in the Global Strategy and Plan of Action on Public Health, Innovation, and Intellectual Property (GSPA) in 2008, which identified eight main elemen ts and 25 sub-elements spread across about 100 action points cutting across various sectors. The main elements cover important areas for action to improve delivery and access, such as prioritizing and promoting research and development, building and improving innovati ve capacity, transfer of technology and application and management of intellectual property to contribute to innovation and promote public health. Report of a Regional Consultation Page 4 SEA Region Member States and the Regional Office contributed to the process of identification of priorities under the stra tegy by playing a critical role during the Intergovernmental Working Group process leading to the formulation of GSPA. In this context, it is now opportune for Member States of the South-East Asia Region to develop a Regional Framework and identify national and regional priority areas for suitable interventions. While other Regional offices in WHO have initiated action in this regard, this is the first attempt by any Region to outl ine specific action poin ts for 25 sub-elements of the strategy under the innovation/IPR/trade framework. The objective of this regional consultation is to develop a national and regional framework that corresponds to the specific requirements and needs of the pe ople of the WHO SEA Region and which is acceptable to them. These requirements need to be addressed through interventions that take advantage of opportunities and address the potential challenges for public health. This is particularly important in the areas of medicines and diagnostic devices, where quality, safety and efficacy are major co ncerns and where trade agreements create obligations. In order to facilitate this process the SEARO Secretariat developed framework templates for identifying regional and national priorities. The consultation is to provide an opportunity for sharing experiences among countries and participating in identifying priority areas at the national and regional levels. These experiences and the combined wisdom would be useful in improving and re fining the templates and in the development of a Framework that is suitable for the social context of Member States in the SEA Region. Additionally, amid reports suggesting that tie-ups between Indian and multinational drug companies may result in a steady loss of manufacturing capacity for affordable drugs needed in the rest of the developing world, there is a need to examine the pharmaceutical products sector in India (whi ch has been described as the \"pharmacy of the developing world 9\"). For this purpose, an analysis of medical products enterprises under the Fourth All India Census 2009 of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Ministry of the Government of India identifies the factors promoting technical know-how for enterprises other than the so-called \"Big Pharma\" . An outline of the analysis is presented in the Regional Consultation in orde r to obtain the views of Member States on this important issue. As a result of the deliberations of the Regi onal Consultation, the Regional Director's message hoped that these discussions will le ad to recommendations and the development of a framework of a high order, enabling the outlining of national and regional strategies of particular relevance to SEA Region. 9 http://www.oxfamindia.org/content/oxfam-urges-india-remain -%E2%80%98pharmacy-developing-world%E2%80%99 (last visited 23.9.11) Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page 5 5. Opening remarks The introduction to the meeting was given by Dr Athula Kahandaliyanage, Director, Health Systems and Development (HSD) Departme nt. In his address, Dr Athula stressed that the Regional Consultation for Develo pment of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property , should consider the 2008 World Health Assembly Resolution 61.21 in the SEA regional and national contexts of Member States. The GSPA aims to promote new thinking on innovation and access to medicines and medical products. This provides for a me dium-term framework (2008-2015) for action and is meant to secure needs-driven essent ial health research and development. The G S P A e n d e a v o u r s t o d e a l w i t h i s s u e s o f i m p o r t a n c e t o d e v e l o p i n g c o u n t r i e s s u c h a s diseases which disproportionately affect them. I t a l s o p r o p o s e s t h e s e t t i n g u p o f c l e a r objectives and priorities for R&D and esti mating the funding needs in these areas. In recent years, new initiatives and partnerships have come up to augment access to existing health products and medical devi ces for public health. Member States, the pharmaceutical industry, charitable foundati ons and nongovernmental organizations have undertaken partnering initiatives to develo p new products agains t diseases affecting developing countries. Some of these partners hips like the TB Alliance and Medicines for Malaria Venture are financed by public agencies and private foundations, and partner with research institutes and private pharmace utical companies to develop faster-acting, novel treatments. Other new initiatives incl ude the \"patent pool\". Concerted efforts, however, are needed to meet the health -related Millennium Development Goals. The interdependence of trade and heal th and various international trade agreements have thrown up further challenges in the management of public health. Trade factors are influencing public health in the access and development of medicines and medical products, their regulation, and also national and international trade in these products. E-commerce and the Internet have opened a new range of issues for public health products. A key issue is that the market demand for diagnostics, vaccines and medicines needed to address health problems mainly affect ing developing countries is not attractive. As a result the incentive \"pull effect\" of in tellectual property rights may be limited or nonexistent. There is a need to examine in novate approaches to ensure enhanced financing on a sustainable basis and promote sy nergy between different partners in public health. It is important for WHO and its Member States to take up the task of transforming GSPA into a workable set of policies and actions that will make a difference. The Regional Consultation for Developmen t of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property, examines the various elements of GSPA to maximize their benefits in the SEA Region. Th is consultation also endeavours to utilize certain facets of intellectual property as a development tool and enable Member States and WHO-SEARO to identify and address their priorities at the national, regional and international levels. Report of a Regional Consultation Page 6 6. Proceedings An overview of WHA 61.21, the Global Strate gy and Plan of Action on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property (GSP A) was presented by Dr Manisha Shridhar, Principal Secretary, Government of Himachal Pradesh, India, and formerly Temporary International Professional, Intellectua l Property and Trade, WHO-SEARO. The relevance of WHA 61.21 in the curre nt international trade and economic scenario was outlined. The international trade environment is increasi ngly affecting public health outcomes for Member States of the Regi on. In this context a summary table of the membership of countries of the Region to the World Trade Organization (WTO), World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and related international treaties and conventions was presented at Regional Consultation ( see Annex 8 ). The several agreements to which various Member States ar e signatories to reflects the importance of intellectual property issues and this in turn si gnificantly influences public health policies and outcomes. The expected results from the Regional Co nsultation for Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property were delineated while giving a brief account on each of the eight Elements of GSPA. On 24 May 2008, GSPA identified more than a 100 deliverables across 25 sub- Elements and eight main Elements. The eight Elements are: (1) prioritizing research and development needs; (2) promoting research and development; (3) building and improving innovative capacity; (4) transfer of technology; (5) application and management of intellectual property; (6) improving delivery and access; (7) ensuring sustainable financing mechanisms; and (8) establishing monitoring and reporting systems. These deliverables under the GSPA aim to promote new thinking on innovation, transfer of technology and access to medicine s. In order to achieve these deliverables multifarious actions are needed . Some of these actions relate to existing programmes in WHO that focused on neglected diseases and the \"Big Three\" diseases, i.e. HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. Each of these eigh t elements also has an intellectual property and trade (IPT) component that needs to be explored and developed in order to maximize the results under the GSPA. The Regional Consultation attempts to identi fy and prioritize IPT actions in GSPA on Template A for maximizing their benefits in the SEA Region (Annex 7) . This also attempts Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page 7 to utilize certain facets of intellectual proper ty as a development tool and enable Member States and SEARO to identify and address thei r priorities at the national, regional and international levels. Methodology Member States were invited to fill in Templa te A in order to develop their national and regional priority areas in IPT under the GSPA and in order to outline a concerted plan of action suitable to their specific needs. This identification will also enable WHO-SEARO to provide IPT assistance specially designed to the country's needs. Template A takes up the eight main Elements and 25 sub-Elements and delineates an IPT component for consideration by Member States (Annex 7) . The Annex 7 was taken up for detailed discussi ons at the Regional Consultation meeting. The deliberations on Annex 7 benefited from the work of the experts from the countries of Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Sri Lanka discussed earlier. These experts had worked on this template ahead of the workshop. Their work had a direct bearing on the Development of the Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property is included herewith. The pharmaceutical sector performs a crit ical role in the supply of affordable medical products. More than many industries , the performance of the pharmaceutical industry is dependent on the economic po licy framework set by governments, in particular the patent regime, and regulato ry arrangements designed to ensure that products are safe, efficacious and of good quality. Therefore, in order to prepare a focused regional and country-specific acti on plan it is necessary to examine the pharmaceutical sector. Information on the sectors was obtained from Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Sri Lanka before the workshop on the following: (1) Pharmaceuticals: Information on local production and transfer of pharmaceutical-related technology to the country. (2) Traditional Medicine: The current status of traditional medicine in the country. (There is a growing interest on traditio nal and herbal systems of medicine and its results on public health, and GSPA in Element 1 focuses on research and development in traditional medicine). (3) Medical technologies: WHO organized the First Global Forum on Medical Devices on 9-11 September 2010 in Bang kok, Thailand. The Global Forum for Health Research has estimated that in 2005, an estimated US$ 160.3 billion was spent globally on health research and development. Of this, 97% was spent by high-income countries used to generate products, processes and services for their own health-care markets. The remaining 3% was spent by low- and middle-income countries. Thus, the position of medical technologies in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Sri Lanka was outlined.

Technical discussions 7.1 Factors promoting technical know -how in Indian micro, small and medium pharmaceutical enterpri ses: A Study by Prof. Arvind Chaturvedi, International Management Institute, and Mr Deepak Goyal, Director, Ministry of Stati stics, Government of India The World Health Assembly in May 2003 set up an independent commission for analyzing the relationship between intellectua l property rights (IPR), innovation and public health. The resulting CIPIH report in 2006 made important observations on the status of innovation and IPRs in the pharmaceutical industry. The performance of the pharmaceutical industry is more dependent th an many industries on the economic policy frameworks set up by national governments, and in particular the patent regime, and the various regulatory arrangements designed to en sure that products are safe, efficacious and o f g o o d q u a l i t y . I n v i e w o f t h e i m p o r t a n c e o f i n n o v a t i o n a n d t e c h n o l o g y t r a n s f e r i n matters related to access to medicines by develo ping countries, it is imperative that these issues are examined in the WHO South-East Asia Region. The Indian pharmaceutical sector is a major supplier of generic medicines worldwide. For this purpose, a study of the ph armaceutical enterprises under the aegis of the Fourth All-India Census of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises 2006-2007 conducted by the Ministry of Micro, Sma ll and Medium Enterprises (MSME) of the Government of India 10 was undertaken by the WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia. This census of MSMEs was conducted with reference to the year of 2006-2007.11 This study provides information, based on existing census data, of the factors promoting technology adoption for pharmaceutical enterprises other than those that constitute the \"Big Pharma\" industries in India. An appraisal of the profile of this sector could enable policy interventions to ensure the continuous supply of generic medicines for developing countries. This study focuse d on examining technical know-how in these pharmaceutical enterprises leading to: (1) profiling of pharmaceutical-, traditional medicine-, dental- and medical technology -based enterprises. (2) investigating factors promoting technical know-how. (3) estimating the role and contribution of identified factors influencing technical know-how. 10 The micro, small and medium enterprises development act, 2006 , Annual Report 2009-10 and Acts, Rules & Notifications on the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are available in its website http://www.msme.gov.in Information on organized and unorganized sector en terprises, i.e. latest Re port on ASI and NSS 62nd Round Surveys are available in the M/o Statistics & Programme Implementation's website http://www.mospi.nic.in. 11 Quick results Fourth All-India Census of Micro, Small & Me dium Enterprises 2006-2007, Gove rnment of India, Development Commissioner [MSME], Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, A Wi ng 7th Floor, Nirman Bhawan, New Delhi 110011. Report of a Regional Consultation Page 10 For classification of enterprises, the Unio n Government, in exercise of the powers conferred by sub-Section (i) of Section 7 of The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 has notified enterpri ses under the respective categories of \"micro\", \"small\" and \"medium\".12 For the purpose of this study on pharmaceutical and medical products, the census information on enterprises with investments in plant and machinery (excluding land and buildings) is divided in three segments. These three categories have been id entified due to the fact that prio r to the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006, an indust r y w a s c l a s s i f i e d a s \" s m a l l \" i f i t h a d investment in plant and machinery of Rs 10 million. This ceiling was subsequently raised to Rs 50 million by the Act in 2006. Severa l policy interventions prior to 2006 have promoted the development of small industry. Group I: Pharmaceutical and medical products This group includes the following seven subgroups and 122 products. The subgroups are: 13 (1) vitamins. (2) hormones, glands an d products thereof. (3) antiserum, blood fractions, immu nological products and vaccines. (4) antibiotics and preparations thereof. (5) alkaloids and preparations thereof. (6) other medicaments and preparations thereof. (7) pharmaceutical products including family planning goods. 12 7.1) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 11B of the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951, the Central G overnment may, for the purposes of this Act, by notification and having regard to the provisions of sub-Sections (4) and (5), classify an y class or classes of enterprises, whether proprietorship, Hindu Undivided Family, asso ciation of persons, cooperative society, partnership firm, com pany or undertaking, by whatever name called, - (a) in the case of the enterprises engaged in the manufacture or production of goods pertaining to any industry specified in th e First Schedule to the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951, as: (i) a micro enterprise, where the investment in plant an d machinery does not exceed twenty five lakh rupees; (ii) a small enterprise, where the investment in plant and machinery is more than twenty five lakh rupees but does not exceed f ive crore rupees; or (iii) a medium enterprise, where the investment in plant and machin ery is more than five crore rupees but does not exceed Rs 10 crore; (b) in the case of the enterprises engaged in providing or rendering of services, as: (i) a micro enterprise, where the investment in equipment does not exceed ten lakh rupees; (ii) a small enterprise, where the investment in equipment is more than ten lakh rupees but does not exceed two crore rupees; o r (iii) a medium enterprise, where the investment in equipment is mo re than two crore rupees but d oes not exceed five crore rupee s. Explanation 1: For the removal of doubt, it is hereby clarified that in calculating the investment in plant and machinery, the cost of pollution control, research and development, industrial safety devices and such other items as may be specified, by notification, shall b e excluded. Explanation 2: It is clarified that the provisions of Section 29B of the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951, sha ll be applicable to the enterprises specified in sub-clauses. 13 According to MSME classification of data. Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page 11 Group II: Homeopathic, Ay urvedic and Unani medicines This group includes many subgroups and also includes live trees, plants, bulbs, roots, cut flowers and foliage; forestry products; cosmetics and perfumes, etc. This group has six subgroups and 145 products 14. These are: (1) d a i r y p r o d u c t s u s e d i n t h e p r e p a r a t i o n o f A Y U S H ( A y u r v e d a , Y o g a , U n a n i , Siddha, homeopathy) products; (2) live trees, plants, bulbs, roots, cut flowers and foliage; (3) forestry products used in the preparation of AYUSH products; (4) homeopathic, Ayurvedic and Unani medicines; (5) and essences used in preparation of AYUSH products; and (6) cosmetics and perfumes. Group III: Dental and dent istry materials/products This group includes 12 products such as wax, chlorinated paraffin, dental wax, toothpastes and toothpowders, etc. Group IV: Pharmaceutical ma chinery, equipment and parts This group includes three subgroups and 57 products. Products include films, X-ray films and plates, hosing machinery, hearing aids, etc. They also include: (1) medical, surgical, laboratory and health fitness equipment. (2) human safety articles and parts thereof. In order to identify measures to promote ph armaceutical generics in the country, it would therefore be appropriate to study all enterprises in the following three segments: (1) Micro enterprises, with investment in plant and machinery not exceeding Rs 2.5 million (US$ 56 000)*, (2) Small enterprises, with investment in plant and machinery not exceeding Rs 10 million (US$ 220 000)*, and (3) Other enterprises,15 with investment in plant and machinery not exceeding Rs 100 million (US$ 2 200 000)*. * Rs45 = US$ 1 14 As indicated by Activity and Product Classification for MSME Sector (Based on ASICC 2000 & NIC 2004 ) 15 'Small' and 'Other' enterprises together comprise medium enterprises as under the MSME Act 2006. Report of a Regional Consultation Page 12 The number of enterprises involved with th e pharmaceutical products sector as per the MSME Census of 2006-2007 database was 16 159. Of these enterprises a predominant number, i.e. 90.71% or 14 658 ente rprises, were in the \"Micro enterprises\" category; enterprises\" category; and only 2.59% or 418 units were in the \"other enterpri ses\" category having an investment in plant and machinery of more than Rs 100 million. Apart from investigating the profiles of Micro, small and other enterprises 16 as a whole, this study also examines pharmaceutical enterprises with respect to four categories of medical products: (1) Pharmaceutical (and Medical) products, (2) Traditional medicines (homeopathic, Ayurvedic and Unani medicines) , (3) Dental (and dentistry materials) products, and (4) Medical technology (pharmaceutical machiner y, equipment and parts) . The group-wise distribution of the pharmaceutical product enterprises in the four categories reveals that in Group I there we re a total of 2258 enterprises engaged in pharmaceutical and medical products producing 122 products. Group II, or homeopathic, Ayurvedic and Unani medicines, includes 11 758 enterprises producing 145 products. Group III, or dental and dent istry materials and pr oducts, comprises 456 units engaged in producing 12 products. Group IV, or pharmaceutical machinery, equipment and parts, covering medical techno logies has 1687 units with 57 products ( see Table 1 ).

These are both metric (ratios) an d categorical variables. Metric variables are those that have numbers such as (i) value of pl ant and machinery, (ii) value of export, etc. Categorical variables are those that reflect qual itative aspects such as: (i) sector: rural or urban; (ii) social status of the owner, etc. The data is analyzed in three stages: First, the relevant variables having a bearing on technical know-how are identified. Next, sorting is done for those which had a significant relationship with the adoption of Technica l know-how. Then a \"Causal Model\" (logistic regression) is used to assess the role and importance of these variables in determining the adoption of technical know-how for Indian pharmaceutical-based MSMEs. Summary findings of the study: The analysis of all 16 159 enterprises reveals the factors that have a positive contribution on the adoption of technical know-how. These are: where the enterprise is an ancilla ry unit for other enterprises, those having quality certification, organization type, nature of operation, 17 Quick results Fourth All-India Census of Micro, Small & Me dium Enterprises 2006-2007 Govern ment of India, Development Commissioner [MSME], Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprieses, A-Wi Floor, Nirman 403-412. 18 Item No 8: Technical know-how obtained from abroad, domest ic collaboration company, domest ic R&D institution/specialized agency/organization, none), Ibid p 399. 19 65 parameters in the collected field data is taken up in 19 variables for this analysis of MS ME pharmaceutical enterprises.

Some other factors are seen to have a ne gative contribution to the adoption of technical know-how on Indian pharmaceutical -based MSMEs. These are enterprises that have taken loans, wages (remuneration paid to the employees), and women-led enterprises. The parameters that are seen to have a positive impact on technical know-how, innovation and research and Development in Indian MSMEs in the pharmaceutical sector (Micro, small and others) based on the criterio n of investment in plant and machinery are given in Table 3.

The importance and role of these determinants vary over each group analyzed. As a result of these analyses the following recommendations emerge for policy considerations: Promotion of ancillary units A \"Micro\" unit associated with another enterprise as an ancillary unit paves the way for technical know-how adoption. Simi larly, functioning as an ancillary unit is beneficial to enterprises in Group II and Group IV. Nature of operation The Census on MSMEs 2006-2007 mapped enterp rises on the nature of their operation: perennial, seasonal or casual. The analysis showed that perennial functioning of enterprises in MSME pharmaceutical sec tor contributed towards a high degree of adoption of technical know-how. The lack of perennial operations appeared to have hindered the adoption of technical know-how in \"Micro\" units and in units in Group II (homeopathic, Ayurvedic and Unani medicines). If a unit is working round the year it is more likely to adopt technical know-how than a unit that ha s irregular operations during the year. Wages The Census on MSMEs 2006-2007 mapped enterprises on the basis of wages paid to employees.21 Payment of higher wages was seen to have a positive effect on technical know-how adoption by MSMEs in the pharmaceutical sector.22 This correlation is particularly seen in the case of \"small\" enterprises and those enterprises in Group I (pharmaceutical and medical products). Organization structure (legal structure) Private limited or public limite d enterprises are seen to have a greater inclination for the adoption of technical know-how than proprie torship units/family-run concerns. Technical know-how adoption shows a marked positive trend in the\"Others\" category (the larger enterprises which have this structure) and in Group I (pharmaceutical and medical products) category. 21 Item No. 20 & 21 of Block [2]: Employment & total wage bill du ring 2006-2007: Employment is co mprised of own workers, direct workers or contract/casual employees who contribute to the proces s of production or rendering of services. Employment is direct ly related to the factor of production, namely, 'labour'. Total wage bill: the payment made to workers in cash and/or kind. This i ncludes salaries and wages, allowances, bonuses, etc. 22 The wages paid would necessarily be higher than the prescribed minimum wage. Report of a Regional Consultation Page 16 Special benefit groups The \"Micro\" sector analysis reveals that un its owned by persons with a certain social background, such as Scheduled Castes/Sch eduled Tribes/Other Backward Classes (SCs/STs/OBCs)23 and religious minorities show a hi gher adoption of technical know-how . It appears that special grant schemes/ specif ic financial support for these social groups such as SCs/STs/OBCs and also religious minori ties enable the adoption of better technical know-how. Quality certification This is an important driver for the adoption of technical know-how across pharmaceutical MSMEs. In all three sets of enterprises base d on size of the unit\u2014\"Micro\", \"small\" and \"others\"\u2014quality certification positively infl uences the adoption of technical know-how. Quality certification positively influences Group I and Group IV category enterprises. There is a positive linkage between quality certification and technical know-how with greater linkages observed for International Standards Organization (ISO) certifications . The pharmaceutical MSMEs, therefore, should be encouraged to get quality certification, preferable ISO certifications. Loans I n t h e o v e r a l l a n a l y s i s ( a n d a l s o i n o t h e r s u b g r o u p s ) i t h a s b e e n f o u n d t h a t t h e r e i s a n inverse relationship between loans taken and the probability of adoption of technical know-how. The analysis suggests that thos e enterprises which are financially self- dependent and comfortable (not opting for lo ans) are more likely to adopt technical know-how. This raises an important question as to why the adoption of technical know- how is less among units which have availed of loans. This finding has significant implications for policies over various scheme s of the Government of India that promote loans for MSMEs. Electricity as source of power For pharmaceutical and medical products ente rprises, using electricity as a source of power positively affects the adoption of technical know-how. The Census on MSMEs 2006-2007 mapped enterprises on their use of fuel and power.24 T h i s a s p e c t i s prominently observed in Group I (pharmaceu tical and medical products) enterprises. 23 As given in the schedule of the Constitution of India 24 Item No.5: Main source of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page 17 Exports Pharmaceutical MSMEs engaged as exporting un its have a greater likelihood of adopting technical know-how measures. This aspect is significant for enterprises in Group III (homeopathic, Ayurvedic and Unani medicines). It appears that regulatory requirements needed for exports result in higher probabil ity of technical know-how adoption by these enterprises. Thus, promotion of exports as a policy measure results in the adoption of better technical know-how in enterprises. Scale of operation-Number of employees and value of plant and machinery These two parameters defining the scale of operation of the enterprise\u2014number of Employees and value of plant and machiner y\u2014are both related to the size of the operation. Both variables indicate that the larger th e scale of the operation the higher will be the likelihood of adoption of technical know-how. This is specially observed in Group IV units (dental and dentistry materials/products). This suggests that an upgradation of these two parameters would push these enterprises towards adoption of technology and know-h ow. This could be achieved in two ways: (a) by providing appropriate financial measures to enhance the size of the operation, and (b) by encouraging the units to go for mergers and amalgamations. Urbanization Urbanization appears to be an important factor in technical know-how adoption for pharmaceutical MSMEs as per the Census 20 06-2007 data. Enterprises located in urban areas are more likely to go in for technical know-how adoption. Urban \"micro\" enterprises and Group II and IV units are particularly favourable to technical know-how adoption when located in urban areas than when situated in rural areas. This indicates that urban areas provide certain infrastructural advantages over rural areas that facilitate technical know-how adoption. Limitations of the study The limitations of the study are that the analys is on technical know-how is limited to the information parameters of the Census on MSMEs 2006-2007. Specific information parameters on innovation and research and development (R&D) and patents as a measure of innovation are not captured in the data and these are critical to the pharmaceutical sector. Additionally, enterp rises obtaining technical know-how from abroad were only about 2% of the total units. Hence, this variable - securing technical know-how from abroad - could not be studied in detail and was used as a binary variable only. Report of a Regional Consultation Page 18 However, an analysis of the enterprises obtaining this know-how placed emphasis on the factors promoting technology absorption by such enterprises. Also, secondary data a n d c a s e s t u d i e s n e e d t o b e m a d e t o v e r i f y t h e f i n d i n g s o n f a c t o r s t h a t i n f l u e n c e t h e adoption of technical know-how. There is, fo r instance, no information on perceptions about the need for adoption of technical know -how. These findings are based purely on a mathematical model, and the interrelations hip of variables may have affected the outcome. In order to address public health needs an d ensure a regular supply of medicines and medical products, it is necessary for Indian policy-makers to target the MSME pharmaceutical enterprises that constitute the bulk of the enterprises. There is a need to further examine their innovation and R&D n eeds, including regula tory prerequisites (WHO GMP certifications, etc.), to enhance th eir capabilities to m eet future domestic and international needs. T h i s s t u d y i s u n i q u e i n t h a t t h e c o m p l e t e u n i v e r s e o f M S M E p h a r m a c e u t i c a l enterprises sector has been examined as th e data from the Census on MSMEs 2006-2007 enumerated all MSMEs within the country. Th is analysis gives us a base on which to centre future studies to encourage generic ph armaceutical production in enterprises in India. 7.2 Challenges in GSPA deliverables fo r the Indian pharmaceutical industry after TRIPS - A proposal for R&D cooperation: Prof. Sudip Chaudhuri, Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, India Promoting R&D and innovative capacity is one of the major obje ctives of GSPA. For access to medicines the most important issu es are availability, affordability and appropriateness. Few or no drugs exist for ne glected diseases (Type II), particularly the very neglected diseases (Type III) such as African trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis and Chagas disease, etc. There has been some in crease in R&D for drug development in the case of neglected diseases by some not-for- profit organizations such as the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative and by certai n multinational pharmaceutical corporations ( M N C s ) . B u t i t i s w i d e l y b e l i e v e d t h a t m o r e n e e d s t o b e d o n e a n d p a r t i c u l a r l y b y developing countries themselves. The widely recognized incentives for ne w drug development include the \"Push\" mechanism [involving public support such as direct public spending, R&D grants, tax credits, etc.] and the \"Pull\" mechanism of product and process patent protection. After signing of Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement of the World Trade Organization, In dia introduced a product patent regime in pharmaceuticals from 1 January 2005. The argument advanced by multinational companies was that developing countries too would benefit from stronger patent protection because it will stimulate private R&D investment on diseases endemic to developing countries. Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page 19 Table 5: Thirteen Indian companies involved in new drug R&D, 2007-2008 Rs million % of sales $ million companies 18264.6 8.18 Indian companies involved in new drug R&D, 200708 *: Now taken over by foreign companies It was also more specifically claimed th at local companies will be prompted to spend more on R&D for the development of ne w drugs more ssuited to their needs. The position on new drug development is given in Tables 5, 6 and 7. Table 6: R&D by Indian companies 02468101214 02000400060008000100001200014000160001800020000 % of salesRs milliony p Rs million % of sales Note: For 11 Indian companies involved in new drug R&D Indian companies are not yet ready for a start-to-finish model in new chemical entities (NCE) research because of lack of sk ills and funds. The model followed by them is to develop new molecules up to a certain stag e and then licence them to partners from Report of a Regional Consultation Page 20 developed countries, primarily MNCs. As a resu lt of this MNC focus, not surprisingly, New Chemical Entities (NCEs) being developed by Indian companies are related primarily to global diseases such as diab etes, cancer, heart diseases, as thma and obesity rather than the neglected diseases more specific to India. The one exception is the development of one anti-TB and one anti-malaria NCE. There are other reasons for this collabo ration between Indian pharmaceutical companies and MNCs. In the pre-TRIPS era there was no patent on pharmaceutical products. There was only process patent. Henc e, Indian companies were not required to promote drugs; only limited phase-III clin ical trials were necessary. Hence Indian pharmaceutical companies did not develop the expertise for developing new drugs. In the post-TRIPS new drug development phase Indi an companies experienced difficulties in promoting drugs developed independently. Table 7: Number of NCEs under clinical Dabur There has not been a single instance of a drug developed elsewhere and successfully marketed in developed countries, particularly in the United States and Western Europe, without the involvement of MNCs. The allian ce with MNCs has additional challenges such as inadequate emphasis on drugs for ne glected diseases and potential conflict of interest with respect to the marketing of th e drugs. Indian companies are now aware of these difficulties and thus ne w drug R&D has been privately initiated in India initiative even though the Indian private sector has not yet matured to handle independent R&D for new drugs. Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page 21 There is thus a need for publ ic support and public-private partnerships in India. The \"push\" incentives of public support are direct public spending, R&D grants and fiscal incentives. India has an elaborate public R& D infrastructure. The Central Drugs Research Institute (CDRI) - which is a laboratory under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) - has been involved in new drug development since its inception in 1951. It is one of the few public sector organizations in the world which have their own full-fledged drug development infrastructure. This institute has developed about 10 drugs till date but none of them are registered in developed countries or have been commercially successful. One of the major reason s for this is that CDRI has had hardly any interaction with the pharmaceutical industry. The reason for not encouraging industry participation lies not only with CDRI but also with the fact that Indian companies lacked incentives to go in for product developmen t (in the pre-TRIPS era) and were keen to collaborate only in proces s development for drugs. There have been significant efforts from the government to induce public-private partnerships (PPP) in the drug industry . Some of the programmes initiated are Department of Science and Technology's (D ST) Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Research Programme, the Open Source Drug Discovery Programme of CSIR, CSIR's New Millennium Indian Technology Leadership Initiative (NMITLI), the Department of Biotechnology's (DBT) Small Business Innovation Research Initiative (SBIRI) and Biotechnology Industry Part nership Programme (BIPP). The basic idea is to synergize the strengths of publicly funded R&D institutions and the Indian pharmaceutical industry and prov ide a collaborative platform bolstered by grants and soft loans. Major national laboratories and pharmaceutical companies have been involved in this endeavour and the budget for this, though small, is increasing year by year. Figure 1: Institutions Engaged in Medical R&D in India R&D in India Government Private sector Higher education StateCentral 12 Major scientific agencies R&D performing: CSIR ICMR EtcR&D financing: DST DBT Etc Report of a Regional Consultation Page 22 These programmes promote funding, but it ma y be seen that funds are not the only problem. Some of the basic issues that ph armaceutical products from developing countries face have not yet been adequately tackled. The challenge is not only the development of a new drug. It is also about how to promote it. This is one of the major challenges in collaborating with MNCs. The solution then is to propose an R& D model bypassing the role of MNCs and developed countries, and calling for the case for South-South cooperation. In the South- South R&D Model, it is envi saged to expand the Indian PPPs and include organizations from other developing countries, including co untries of the South-East Asia Region, to develop new drugs and conduct clinical trials and get internal regulatory approvals. Marketing initiatives should focus on these countries rather than on developed countries and MNCs. The advantage of this model is that the costs of clinical trials will be significantly lowered due to the lower costs of the same in these countries. Clinical trials can be up to 40% of the cost of developing a new drug and regulatory approvals contribute another 10%. The developing coun tries will provide a large enough market for the pharmaceutical companies in these coun tries to participate in the PPPs model and thus also provide an alternative option to collaborating with MNCs. If and when these drugs are successful, efforts may be initiated to get these registered and marketed in developed countries as well. 7.2 New IPR regime and access to medi cines in Sri Lanka - Next steps under WHA61.21: Dr Manuj C. Weerasinghe, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, Sri Lanka Dr Manuj C. Weerasinghe presented his work on the drug regulatory system in Sri Lanka. The WTO agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights was signed in Marrakesh, Morocco, on 15 April 1994. This agreement seeks to maintain a balance between the long-term social objectives of pr oviding incentives for future inventions and creation and the short-term objective of allo wing people to use existing inventions and creations. But the benefits of the TRIPS Ag reement for developing countries are still debatable. As a developing co untry the new Intellectual Proper ty Rights (IPR) regime has been applicable in Sri Lanka from the year 2005. The Sri Lankan system is governed by the Cosmetic Devices and Drugs Act (CDDA) of 1980. The Drug Regulatory Authority (DRA ) that is responsible for the process of registration is under the authority of the Di rector-General of Health Services. The Drug Evaluation Sub-Committee (DESC) advises the Director-General on all applications for drug registration that they receive. The DESC generally relies on the information presented by the applicant for this purpose. At present, the need or the cost of the drug is not seriously considered in registering pharmaceuticals in Sri Lanka. Cost of me dicinal drugs and their affordability to the ordinary consumer in the developing countries has been a major point of discussion. Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page 23 This is further complicated by the pursuit of the pharmaceutical industry on extended patent protection on essential me dicines. The debate on achieving public health objectives while at the same time ensu ring the protection of intellectual property rights is far from over. In this atmosphere, the IPR regime in the world changed drastically with the formation of the World Trade Organi zation and the enforcement of the TRIPS Agreement (WTO, 1990). Sri Lanka, a founde r m e m b e r o f W T O , i s a s i g n a t o r y t o t h e TRIPS Agreement. However, until now IPR status is not recognized as a criterion for the registration process of pharmaceuticals under the CDDA. Th e present Sri Lankan IPR Act enforced in 2003 incorporated the provisions of the TR IPS Agreement, thus providing exclusive IP rights up to a minimum of 20 years from the da te of filing date. Although five years have elapsed since the beginning of the new IPR regime in Sri Lanka, it is yet to examine its impact with respect to prices and degree of av ailability of pharmaceuticals under patent. It is crucial to establish a baseline to follow and predict the implications of TRIPS provisions to public health in the country at th is juncture as the real effects of the new IPR regime are to be evidenced in the pharmace utical market within the next decade. There were no systematic research studies undertaken in this area in Sri Lanka till date. Establishing the baseline at this stage will help to track and remedy the unforeseeable effects that could occur in the future. It is particularly important to provide evidence for advocating consumer-friendly approaches in drug selection and registration, and maintaining affordable prices in the pharmaceutical market. The study examines the patent status of ne w drugs registered in Sri Lanka during the first five years of the new IPR regime (2 005-2010), and the price fluctuations and perceptions of the pharmaceutical regulators on the new IPR regime in respect of the public health implications. During the past five years about 70 NCEs were registered at the Drug Regulatory Authority by 19 pharmaceutical companies. The NCEs came under 35 therapeutic groups according to ATC classification Level Three.2255 Two NCEs had no ATC codes. Except for four therapeutic groups (bile therapy, othe r respiratory system products, parathyroid hormones and analogues, and low-ceiling diuretics excluding thiazides) all other groups had alternatives in the Sri Lankan market. 25 http://en.wikipedia.org/wi ki/Anatomical Therapeutic_Ch emical_Classification_System The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System is used for the classification of drugs. It is controlled by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Me thodology (WHOCC), and was first published in 1976. The classifica tion system divide s drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their th erapeutic and chemical characteri stics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a phar maceutically used substance in a single indication (or use). This means that one dr ug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for ex ample, has A01AD05 as a drug fo r local oral treatment, B01AC06 a s a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analg esic and antipyretic. On the other hand, se veral different brands share the same cod e if they have the same active substance and indications. In this system, drugs are classified into groups at five different levels: First level : The first level of the code indicates the anatomical main gr oup and consists of one letter. There are 14 main groups. Second level : The second level of the code indicates the therapeutic main group and consists of two digits. Example : C03 Diuretics: Third level : The third level of the code indicates the therapeutic/pharmacological subgroup and consists of one letter. Example : C03C High-ceiling diuretics. Fourth level : The fourth level of the code indicates the chemical/thera peutic/pharmacological subgroup and consists of one letter. Example : C03CA Sulfonamides. Fifth level: The fifth level of the code indicates the chemical substance and consists of two digits. Example : C03CA01 Furosemide Report of a Regional Consultation Page 24 Figure 2: NCEs on the Sri Lankan or WHO Essential Drug Lists The information on drugs which has been included in the essential drug lists of WHO and Sri Lanka is as follows: out of the 70 NCEs, 7 drugs (10%) were included in the Sri Lankan Essential Drugs List (2009), while two drugs (2.8%) were on the WHO Essential Drugs List (2010 March). Out of the 86 alte rnatives for the NCEs that were already available in the Sri Lankan market, 63 (73%) an d 47 (54%) drugs were included in the Sri Lankan and WHO Essential Drug Lists respectively. The data from the National intellectual Prop erty Office of Sri Lanka reveals that 874 entries in the database for patent applicatio ns with the National Intellectual Property O f f i c e f r o m 2 0 0 6 t i l l d a t e w e r e c h e m i c a l compounds and patent claims in the patent applications that were compatible with medicinal drugs. Figure 3: Pharmaceutical patent applicants in Sri Lanka Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page 25 The major concerns for Sri Lanka with regard to pharmaceutical patents are as follows: there are a wide range of drugs registered annually and the newer drugs are registered with innovator brands. There are many NCEs that have therapeutic alternatives and there is always an advantage of early entry of generics. Th e NCEs are generally expensive and certain observed prescr iption patterns favour their use. On the intellectual property and patent side, patent applications for medicinal compounds are increasing. There appears to be a possible shift of limited resources towards newer medicines. A major challenge is the widespread entry of counterfeit medicines fuelling the debate on coun terfeit versus generic medicines. Important interventions on behalf of the government for the pharmaceutical sector in Sri Lanka would be: Human resource development in IPR. Definite separation of the drug registration and IP offices. Removing barriers for the entry of ge neric medicines and medical products. Price control for essential drugs. 7.3 Identification and prioritization for Regional and Na tional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Rights in India: Dr K. Satyanarayana, Senior Deputy Director-General and Head, IPR Unit, Department of Health Rese arch, Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi, India Dr Satyanarayana expressed certain priority ar eas of concern in the GSPA. On Element 1: prioritizing R&D, the issue of concern is th at there has been systematic mapping of intellectual property, more so for Types II and III diseases. The countries of the WHO South-East Asia Region lack a National IP strategy. The R&D \"mapping\" is incomplete and there is not enough clarity on choice of databases to perform this kind of mapping. Moreover, there is no national disease-specif ic R&D strategy and there is very little coordinated effort between various stakeholders and agencies. The issue of R&D should also reflect in the National Health Policy and National Health Research Policy. There appears to be a lack of clarity on IPR with regard to whether to encourage patents or not. The question whether defe nsive patenting - where an entity seeks a patent primarily to protect its own IP and does not prioritize dissemination of the product - is appropriate needs to be answered. We need to strike a fine balance between securing out IP rights and benefit-sharing and this may be particularly important when we utilize traditional knowledge digital libraries (T KDL). In the latter context, strategic options n e e d t o b e e v a l u a t e d . I s s u e s s u c h a s p r o m o t i n g t r a d i t i o n a l m e d i c a l s y s t e m s i n a \"traditional way\" and the rights of indigenous people vis-\u00e0-vis developing a catalogue of intellectual property need further discussions. Regulatory issues on traditional medicine are also a point that needs further debate and elucidation. Report of a Regional Consultation Page 26 O n E l e m e n t 2 , t h a t o f p r o m o t i n g R & D , t h ere have been sporadic efforts. The IP management polices differ, they are both in tramural and extramural and are largely unfocused. There is a lack of priority for neglected diseases and most partnerships on R&D focus on Type-I diseases. Moreover, little coordination or collaboration takes place among various agencies. The qu estion remains whether to collaborate or compete and most instances of partnering only take place during epidemics or outbreaks of disease. On the capacity to access patent data ther e are few efforts, even in the post-TRIPS regime. The scientists are not IP-savvy and thei r technology transfer/adoption skills are still rudimentary. There is the need for going into a \"National Mission mode\" and developing a focused national thinking for upst ream research and development. For building and improving innovative capacity in Element 3, it is important to ensure international collaboration on IP st andards setting and legal frameworks. This collaboration is accentuated during epidemic s but we need clarity and a national focus instead of sporadic efforts. In order to develop national and regional coordination mechanisms using test data op timally and harmonizing regulato ry issues, the need of the hour is to identify and empower a national nodal agency in the de partment of health research. This could also assist in developing a regional strategy and assist in identifying and developing some policy convergence betw een trade and health. There is an urgent need to improve collaboration/cooperation be tween various agencies, even within the departments of health. For building and improving innovative capacity the issue of lack of national IP or the absence of a viable technology transfer poli cy with a clear incent ive scheme happens to be a major bottleneck. We need to think th rough different incentive systems or prize funds and develop newer thinking in this context. For the transfer of technology in Element 4 the national effort for capacity-building has been practically has been insignificant. Much work remains on capabilities for upscaling pre-clinical toxicity; GMP, Go od Clinical Practices (GCP) and certain downstream issues. In many of these areas th ere is better coordinati on between institutes outside the country than within. For developing country models for the development of health products and traditional medicine products, there are no successful \"planned models\". There is some achievement due to the dedicated efforts of certain committed entrepreneurs as a result of which things are looking up! For Element 5, i.e. the application and management of IP to contribute towards innovation and promote public health, there is an urgent need to have a national facility for using patent databases. The approach has to be realistic, e.g. currently there are monetary charges imposed for government de partments by government departments. The ability to do a freedom-to-operate (FTO) search is currently very minimal. Technical support for the criteria of patenting, unde r Section 3(d) of the Indian Patents Act, compulsory licenses, IP linkages, etc. need to be enhanced. Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page 27 Again, linkages between trade and IPRs such as those in emerging Free trade Agreements need to be understood. There appears to be a policy dichotomy between trade and health and a need to sensitize the public on trade and health issues as well as the compulsions of the government, if any. He alth is not advocated or represented well in trade negotiations. The awareness of scientists on IP issues while taking up new R&D needs to be enhanced. Specific incentives for R&D, IP ownership and royalty and priority clearance for regulatory approvals are important issues . There is also a need for clarity on R&D prioritization between Types I, II and III diseas es or for the development of some kind of \" o r p h a n d i s e a s e \" m o d e l a s i s t h e c a s e w i t h the United States for which interagency collaboration should be encouraged. The development of common ethical guidelines and re gulatory procedures and harmonization of ethics and regulatory a ffairs among the Member States of the WHO South-East Asia Region would be benefici al to improve Element 6, which deals with delivery and access. The way ahead involves the need to addres s certain national and regional issues. These include: National Setting of priorities. Policy environment to stimulate partners hips to increase and accelerate R&D, especially drugs for neglected diseases. Develop a consortium of publicly-funded laboratories. Develop the parameters to measure the success of universities and public R&D institutes that create upstream leads. Focused mission-mode projects. New framework for collaborative R&D. - Public sector - Private sector Identify IP management policies to promote innovative R&D in academia, such as with sharing of royalty, etc . Develop policy on IP, technology transfer and other skills. Fast-track regulatory approvals for Types III and II. Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)/ Department of Health Research (DHR) National Health Research Policy. Report of a Regional Consultation Page 28 Regional Innovation largely continues to be driven by markets. Policy discord: TRIPS-compliant national laws versus the flexibilities afforded by the Doha Round vis-\u00e0-vis national heal th needs, e.g., data protection issues in FTAs. Plans should be realistic, prod uct-oriented and sustainable. The establishment of a regional health research forum. 7.4 National Action and Regional Cooperation on WHA 61.21 (GSPA): Mr Dinesh Abrol, Scientist, National Institute of Science Technology and Development Studies (NISTADS), Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, New Delhi, India Mr Abrol began by underlining the importance of greater public understanding of the mandated actions under GSPA among stakeholders. An assessment of the level of understanding and awareness of WHA61.21 and GSPA in India was conducted through studies and consultations in respect of mandated actions (CENTAD, NISTADS & NIPER 26). Lack of preparedness has its basis not on ly in the poor state of awareness of mandated actions but also in the prevailing understanding about the place of intellectual property in the generation and diffusion of innovations. There appears to be a fascination for the pathways of growth through global integr ation and dependence on strong IPR. It is important to understand the origins and causes of market, institutional and systemic failures, elaborating solutions, and for translating solutions into policy. The global dynamics in respect of health research and innovation reveals that in 1990, the Commission on Health Research for Development specified a target of 2% of the national health budgets of low- and midd le-income countries (LMICs) to be spent on public health research The new players (philan thropic foundations and charities) are also not focused on neglected diseases; their priori ty is mainly global communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria. National-lev el priorities differ in the countries and can be tackled through national-level action in collaboration with regional and international players on a needs-driven basis for programme selection. WHA 61.21 offers a national and internatio nal opportunity for systemic corrections in respect of public health and innovation. Th ere is clear evidence that in each and every Member State of WHO there exists a huge opportunity to undertake actions for the systemic correction and remedying of the situ ation on public health, and innovation and actions mandated under WHA 61.21 at the national and international level demand a higher level of commitment and can make th e stakeholders fulfill their responsibility 26 CENTAD: Centre for Trade and De velopment, New De lhi; NISTADS: National Institute of Scienc e Technology and Development Studies, New Delhi and NIPER: National Institute of Pharmaceutical Educat ion and Research S.A.S. Na gar, Mohali, Punjab, India Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page 29 towards public health and innovation. Bu t the forces that matter and have been responsible for the crisis of R&D and innovation for neglected diseases are not as yet fully ready to adopt the correctives; take the po rtfolio of measures to be adopted and the actions that are being proposed, such as the Expert Working Group (EWG) process, health research policy and negotiating TRIPS transiti on for local manufacture and research. Some actions are being taken on account of the vigila nce shown at the international level, but it is only a beginning of the journey that will have to be taken amidst varying perceptions and conflicts of interests that have not ceased to exist. In summary, at the international level the WHO process (WHA, EWG, CEWG) has been bumpy but moving. at the regional level at SEARO a beginning is yet to be made. There have been a number of efforts to prom ote public health issues at the national level in India. For example, efforts undertaken with respect to the incorporation of TRIPS flexibilities and attention to the GSPA process at the level of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoH&FW). There has also been a mo bilization of civil society and industry associations to exercise vigilance on the intr oduction of the Indian version of the Bayh- Dole Act, the development of a manual for patent examination, the work done on the Mashelkar Committee report on the defini tion of pharmaceutical products and microorganisms, data exclusivity and discussi ons related to Section 3 (d) of the Indian Patents Act, 1970, etc. Coherent action is not possible by trade and policy and legislation on IP alone. There is the need to map the state of diversit y and the direction of R&D activities at the national level. We need to assess the state of the national system of innovation in respect of the diffusion of products already known to be relevant and the preparation for the development of new products. This may be done by prioritizing the development and diffusion of appropriate health products. For th is action is required at many levels, and involving human resources, R&D, regulation, delivery and access, coordination, innovation capacity-building, industrial and institutional development, application and management of IP, financing and procurement, and the like. The scope of assessment should also be base d on a systemic view of the prevailing global and national state of R&D and the innovation gap. This needs to take into account the failure, if any, to generate R&D and innovation in new drugs and other health products for neglected diseases, including insu fficient health system research. For this markets, disciplines, governments and institutions have to share the responsibility. The failure of TRIPS in stimulating R&D and innova tion for neglected diseases is now a well recognized fact. We need to begin to assess the progress made at the national level in the following manner: Member States need to identify the tran sition arena and create conditions for the establishment of a transition foru m for the implementation of GSPA. Report of a Regional Consultation Page 30 Member States need to start by undert aking an assessment of the status of completion of activities being undertak en following the mandate under GSPA. Member States must institutionalize the assessment and interactions, nurture the transition arenas, identify the pathways and proceed towards the construction of nation- and region-specific pathways. Example of actions initiated in India on assessment include: Initiation of the assessment of progress made in respect of country strategy and plan of action using WHO identified indicators in 2009 in NISTADS and NIPER. Improvement in the preparedness and the state of awareness of mandated actions within the government and am ong the other relevant stakeholders (industry and research agencies). Gearing up for a better focus on th e development of preparations for intervention from the Indian govern ment in the WHA/IGWG process (2009- 2011). A major issue that needs to be handled is th e lack of prioritization of research for health which leads to inordinately low research output on several diseases and conditions that cause a major disease burden in India. This needs examination not only for Type III (overwhelmingly or exclusively incident in India and other developing countries) and Type II (incident in developed and developing countries but with a substantial proportion of the cases in India and also in many deve loping countries), but also for many Type I (incident in both developed and developing co untries, with large nu mbers of vulnerable populations). The latter includes the new epidemics of chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, mental/neurolo gical conditions, etc. driven by poor diet, lack of physical activity, tobacco use and the like. It is necessary to engage in needs-driven R&D, innovation without monopoly and with dispersion, and decentralization of capaci ty. Alternate mechanisms to strong private IP rights need to be developed, and these ca n be achieved in scenarios such as where: The government increases biomedical re search and places IP in the public domain. Companies and universities donate IP rights. Big pharma industry is encourag ed to set up dedicated units. Institutes and universities are encourag ed to work on Type II & III diseases PPPs are encouraged. Tax incentives are promoted. Orphan Drug Act-type legislations are promulgated. Patent extensions are granted. Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page 31 Consortia and patent pooling is ensured. Buying out patents. Using compulsory licensing. Ensuring differential pricing. Using advance purchase commitments. Incorporating prizes as incentives. Creating dedicated institutions. Promulgating a new system of rewards for all kinds of actors. Certain other alternate new proposals for consideration are: Providing access to existing and patented drugs through transition countries via regional manufacturing facilities. New funding mechanisms and sources and prioritized allocation of funding. Proposals fulfilling the criteria of delinking of R&D costs from product monopoly to help build innovation capacity in developing countries. Formulating a new R&D treaty. Promoting 'Open Source Drug Discovery (OSDD)'. Public financing of clinical trials. Creating dedicated institutions for R&D. 7.5 The implementation of the Global Stra tegy and Plan of Action on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property: Time to act! Nicoletta Dentico, GSPA-PHI cons ultant, Representative from WHO, Geneva Ms Nicoletta Dentico said there have been 12 World Health Assembly resolutions on trade and health issues that have been passed since 1996 till date, i.e. on intellectual property and access to medicines, following painstaking debates. These debates have been initiated soon after the signing of the TRIPS Agreement of the World Trade Organization in 1995. Since then, it has been a long road to the Global Strategy and Plan of Action on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property as envisaged by resolution WHA 61.21. In 2002, the United Kingdom's Commission on IPRs (CIPR) stated that countries need to \"ensure that their IP protection regi mes do not run counter to their public health policies and that they are consistent with and supportive of such policies\". This was f o l l o w e d i n 2 0 0 3 b y t h e W H O C o m m i ss i o n o n Intellectual Property Rights, Innovation and Public Health (CIPIH) which was in response to the request by Member States to task Report of a Regional Consultation Page 32 an independent commission to analyze the relationship between intellectual property rights, innovation and public health. The CIPIH's report, published in April 2006, contained 60 recommendations on how to overcome barriers to essential innovati on and accessing life-saving drugs for those in need. In particular, in stressed the importan ce of \"the need for countries to strike the best balance, in their own circumstances, betw een benefits and costs of the IP system\". The World Health Assembly in May 2006 adopted resolution WHA 59.24 requesting the Director-General to esta blish an Intergovernmental Working Group (IGWG) to draw up a global strategy and plan of action that \"aims at, inter alia, securing an enhanced and sustainable basis for needs-driven, essential health research and development relevant to diseases that dispro portionately affect developing countries\". The resolution clearly also defined research priorities and funding needs (CIPIH report recommendation). The IGWG process was driven by the poli tical leadership of Member States and transformed the CIPIH's analysis to a Member State-driven policy action plan. This process began with its first session in Decemb er 2006. The second session of the IGWG w a s h e l d i n N o v e m b e r 2 0 0 7 a n d t h e n a g ain resumed in April 2008. The follow-up drafting group finalized the strategy at the Si xty-first World health Assembly in May 2008. For the IGWG process the following procedures were adopted: Member States made national/regional submissions to provide further inputs to the negotiating text during the process. Web-based public hearings were held in November 2006 and August- September 2007. Regional consultations were held in all regions from August to October 2007 and continued up to the final stages of the negotiation. The IGWG process was a historic negotiation for the reason that it was a government-driven process in WHO based on the CIPIH analysis linking innovation with access to medical products. The IGWG engaged in the task of removing existing barriers and designing new incentives aligned with publ ic interest in health R&D. A strong role was exercised by developing countries, in part icular Kenya, Brazil, Thailand, India, several Member States of the African Region of WHO, and the Group of Latin American and Caribbean countries of the United Nations (GRULAC). The participating countries sought a sustainable strategy for financing R&D and for ensuring access and a focus on needs that went beyond the \"Big Three\" (AIDS, tu berculosis and malaria) diseases. Member States adopted the global strategy and plan of action on public health, innovation and intellectual property (GSPA) at the Sixty-first World Health Assembly in May 2008 (WHA 61.21). The Health Assembly approved the Global Strategy on Public Health, Innovation and Intellect ual Property at that session unequivocally by stating that: Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page 33 Member States adopted the global strategy and the agreed parts of the plan of action on public health, innovation an d intellectual property (resolution WHA 61.21). The Strategy proposes that WHO play a strategic and central role in the relationship between public health and i nnovation and IP within its mandates, capacities and constitutional objectives. Member States are urged to adopt and support actively the wider implementation of the Global Strategy in particular by providing adequate resources to enhance and implement the specific actions recommended in the strategy vis-\u00e0-vis public health, i nnovation and intellectual property. International organizations and other rele vant stakeholders were urged to give priority within their respective mand ates and programmes to implementing the Global Strategy and plan of action on public health, innovation and intellectual property. WHO must coordinate with other rele vant international intergovernmental organizations, including UNDP, WIPO, WTO, UNIDO and UNCTAD, to effectively implement the Global Strategy and plan of action. The GSPA is the most important WHO initiative on pharmaceuticals since the Essential Medicines Concept (1 977). Some issues such as stakeholders, indicators and time frames, had remained open at that sess ion and were finalized at the Sixty-second World Health Assembly in 2009 (resolut ion WHA 62.16). GSPA is a medium-term strategic plan for the period 2008-2015. The Global Strategy on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property promotes new thinking on innovation and access to medicines. GSPA-PHI is the action plan designed by WHO headquarters, Geneva, and this is designed to: promote innovation, build capacity, improve access, and mobilize resources. There are 25 Sub-Elements and 108 Specific Actions in GSPA. Each of the Specific Actions will facilitate its achievement and wi ll be carried out by various stakeholders. The stakeholders are, inter alia , WHO Member States, WHO, international and national research institutions, academia, national and re gional regulatory agencies, relevant health- related industries (both public and private), public-private partnerships, public-private and product development partnerships, nong overnmental organizations, communities and development partners concerned, charitab le foundations, publishers, research and development groups, and regional bodi es and regional organizations. Various departments in WHO at its headquarters and regional offices are in the process of implementing specific aspects of the Global Strategy. The role Public Health, Report of a Regional Consultation Page 34 Innovation and Intellectual Property in WHO (PHI) is to coordinate and facilitate the implementation of the strategy. Others involved in this task are the COHRED (Council on Health Research and Development) and othe r intergovernmental organizations such as UNCTAD, WTO and WIPO. The outline of the Implementation Plan from 2011 to 2015 is at the global, regional and national levels. The implementation during these four years will comprise two phases and focus on the country level: Phase 1: Preparatory phas e, from 2009 to 2010. Phase 2: Pilot phase, from 2011 to 2012. Phase 3: Broader implementation, from 2013 to 2015. A few initiatives that are being undert aken include a web- based monitoring & evaluation platform for sharing and reporting of information, national assessments and gap analysis tested in six countries during the pi lot phase, technical assistance at the country level, and documentation of national case studies to exemplify good examples of the implementation of GSPA-PHI (as has been th e case with case studies from Switzerland and Brazil). The GSPA has a number of advantages. It is an umbrella instrument but is not too perscriptive, i.e. countries can pick and choos e, and adapt the strategy to their needs, contexts, existing skills and visions. It looks at innovation through the lens of accessibility; this goes beyond R&D and emphasizes inno vation policy. Common health needs must foster collaboration and promote South-South alliances. The regional dimension is key. The opportunity provided by the GSPA should not be squandered by poor implementation policies. Th e shape of what will come largely depends on the commitments and the sense of responsibi lity of those in charge today. 8. National presentations 8.1 Bangladesh: Dr Choudhury Mahmood Hasan, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Univ ersity of Dhaka, Bangladesh (Presentation delivered by Prof. Mahmood Hasan) The status of the pharmaceutical sector in Bangladesh is outlined in Annex 1. 1. Allopathic medicine Pharmaceutical industries are well establishe d in Bangladesh and currently about 97% of medicinal drugs are locally produced, all of these being generic products. Bangladeshi manufacturers are exporting their products, worth US$ 60 million annually, to as many as 84 countries of the world. There are 258 pharmaceutical manufacturing industries, of which the top 20 companies produce 85% of the nation's total produce. Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page 35 As per a 1982 Ordinance, all these comp anies must follow the GMP guidelines prescribed by WHO. But the fa ct is that quite a few of the small-scale companies are not in full GMP compliance. The Drug Administra tion Office is the controlling agency to implement GMP in all these industries. There is acute shortage of manpower in this regulatory organization. Recently, the Drug Ad ministration Office has been upgraded to a Directorate-General (Directorate-General of Dr ug Administration) status and a number of new supervisory and inspection-related posts have been created. At present only 30 technical persons havi ng licensing power are engaged within this office while about 100 posts are waiting to be filled through the recruitment agencies of the government.. This organization is the regula tory body - national regulatory authority - for about 565 Ayurvedic, Unani, homeopathic and herbal companies. The drug retail stores, roughly 100 000 in number, are also regulated by Directorate-General of Drug Administration (DGDA). With the very limite d manpower it is almost impossible to enforce regulatory compliance, including GM P compliance. The DGDA must take urgent initiatives to recruit sufficient techni cal staff to overcome these problems. There are R&D activities in allopathi c companies but limited only to drug formulations. At present, almost 95% acti ve pharmaceutical ingredients (API) are imported. Thus, R&D activities are required in this field. The patent protection regime under TRIP S flexibilities for Bangladesh and other Least Developed Countries will end in January 2016. The patented API is allowed to be manufactured up to this period under the sp ecial flexibilities allowed by the Doha Round of TRIPS. When this deadline expires, pate nted API (mostly of the new generation) must be procured from external sources at a very high price unless the dead line is extended. As such, the price of the finished products will go up and they will be less affordable to the public. The Government of Bangladesh must prov ide funds as loans, with support from international donors, to local API producers. At the same time, efforts must be taken to extend the TRIPS special privileges to Bangla desh and LDCs for a longer period, perhaps up to the year 2025. Otherwise, to ensure people's access to the patented products, the government should manufacture these medici nes in generic formulations through the nation's only public sector manufacturing co mpany (the Essential Drug Company) and sell them at affordable or subsidized prices in the market. As mentioned above, no basic innovative R&D activities are undertaken by local manufacturers although a few manufacturing firms do have a separate R&D unit with very meager fund allocations. Intellectual property aspects are not seriously invoked in the medicine manufacturing sector. Clinical trials are few in number. Some negligible amount of bioequivalence tests are done in many drug companies and by the testing laboratories of the government. Report of a Regional Consultation Page 36 Before 2005 no foreign company could prod uce any of their products under license with a local company unless they had a full-scal e manufacturing unit in Bangladesh. This was the major impediment in technology transfer from reputed international pharmaceutical companies. The 1982 Drug Ordinance was amended in the year 2005, and since then there is no barrier in technolo gy transfer for the production of medicines in Bangladesh. 2. Traditional medicines After 1982 the Drug policy was amended by the enactment of the Drug Ordinance, and medicines under the traditional system began to be considered as drugs and came under the purview of the Drug Administration. At present there are 469 units (268 Unani and 201 Ayurvedic) producing traditional drugs worth approximately US$ 100 million every year. Interestingly most of these are small in size and can be classified as SMEs (small and medium-scale entrepreneurs). GMP compliance is very poor, except for a few. In fact it also not easy for all these enterprises to implement GMP guidelines , which seem to be tailored for only allopathic drugs. As a numb er of people are employed in this sector, strict GMP implementation ne cessitating cancellation of manufacturing licence upon violation may lead to unemployment. It is recommended that a separate GMP guideline should be formulated for SME- type traditional drug companie s. On the other hand, if the current GMP guideline are to be followed then more time should be a llowed for full compliance. WHO-SEARO is currently providing funds through the DGDA to impart training on GMP for technical persons working in these industries. Quality control is a big issue in this sector. When the products are made combining so many plant and in some case animal parts, it is very difficult to assay the preparation. Qualities of raw materials drastically change with storage condition. In general plant products are safe but the plants if not prop erly stored may be infected with fungi and some of these produce toxins harmful for th e human body. There is a great need for R&D activities in this field. As most of thes e companies are small-sized with poor financial reserves, they cannot go in for such resear ch. The local government can indeed raise funds to establish a research institute unde r the Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (BCSIR) which is the only R&D organization in the country. WHO and other international funding organizations may come forward to help establish such R&D institutes. Intellectual property rights (IPR) play an important role in the case of medicinal plants. Bangladesh is a good repository of plant sources: there are about 5000 flowering plants of which around 500 are used in traditional medicine. There is no database on these plants. Thus, it is strongly felt that WHO may provide support to the national herbarium and the DGDA to establish a traditional knowledge database library. Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page 37 3. Herbal medicine Herbal medicine has been recognized as a se parate discipline of drug form after the enactment of the amended Drug Ordinance in 2005. Now any local manufacturer, after obtaining a licence from DGDA, can produce herb al preparations if it is included in the recognized herbal formulary of developed co untries. Earlier no one could produce any herbal preparation not included in the National Ayurvedic and Unani Formulary. Herbal products make use of only a few plants and qu ality control is relative easier here than with traditional medicines. Currently 17 companies produce herbal me dicines and most of them are leading allopathic pharmaceutical industries. Since these are large companies they follow GMP guidelines prescribed by WHO. 4. Homeopathic medicine The homeopathic system is wide ly used in Bangladesh becaus e it is safe and cheap. There are 79 homeopathic manufactures producing ma inly mother tinctures. After the amended drug policy of 2005, manufacturers are allowed to produce homeopathic medicines in dosage form. Again, most of these companies are small-scale ones and cannot follow GMP guidelines properly. Appropriate GMP guidelin es suitable for this sector also need to be formulated. 8.2 India: Dr K. Satyanarayana, Senior Deputy Director-General and Head, IPR Unit, Indian Council of Medica l Research, Department of Health Research, New Delhi, India The status of the pharmaceutical sector in India is outlined in Annex 2. This report attempts an extensive research and objective analysis of the health-care sector and medical technologies in India, name ly the status of pharmaceutical, herbal and dental formulations and medical equipment and devices in India. Parameters studied include present status, growth drivers, issues and challenges, export status, government initiatives and regulatory framework, as also opportunities critical for the growth of the health-care market in the country. A demographic transition is underway in In dia with the rapid growth in the health sector of the past 60 years set to rise furthe r due to better economic status of the people, improved health facilities, better nutrition and overall awareness of good health practices. The percentage of people over 60 in the genera l population is expected to rise from 6.2% in 2001 to about 9% in 2016. At the same time, the population aged below 14 years is expected to drop to 27.1% in 2016 from about 35.6% in 2001. The disease profile continues to mirror the \"dual disease burden\" with both infectious diseases and noncommunicable dise ases - lifestyle-linked diseases such as hypertension, cancer and diabetes - set to rise to significant proportions. Report of a Regional Consultation Page 38 The share of private or out-of-pocket expe nditure by patients has also increased from 60% in 1990-1991 to 80% in 2000-2001, while public expenditure has been stagnant at between 0.9% and 1.2% of GDP during this decade. The cost of providing health care by the private sector is expect ed to be the largest co mponent of individual spending in 2012 and is likely to double to US$ 35.7 billion. Significantly, almost 90% of all private health-care expenditure is met by the unorganized sector, leaving a huge potential market for this sector open to be tapped. Also, India's expenditure on private health care is perhaps the highest among de veloping countries with an estimated 13 lakh private health-care providers. Of them, 97% are in the unorganized sector and therefore fragmented. Over a third of these en tities are not even registered. According to WHO, India spends about 5% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on the health-care sector. It is expected that this figure will rise to 6.1% of GDP by 2012. About 50% is spent on curative and primary care and another 40% on secondary care, including medical specialists in major hospitals with expensive diagnostic equipment. The remaining 10% of the expenditure is on preventi ve care such as health education, weight reduction plans and similar programmes. With both government and the private sector contributing to rapid growth in the industry and a growing population of over 1.1 billion, the demand for infrastructure and high-quality service is immense in India. India's health-care sector is diverse, co mprising the entire gamut of drugs and pharmaceuticals, medical devices, hospitals an d health insurers. The health-care industry includes doctors and other health-care prov iders, hospitals/nursing homes, medical diagnostic and pathology laboratories, and othe r supportive facilities. In terms of revenue and employment alone, the health-care sector is perhaps India's largest service-sector industries. Since the 1990s, the Indian heal th-care sector is growing at a compounded annual rate of 16%. According to industry esti mates, the total current value of the sector is well over US$ 34 billion or about 6% of the GD P. There are also estimates to suggest that by 2012, health-care spending could contribute 8% of GDP and employ around 9 million people. By 2014 it is expected to touch US$ 78.6 billion. The pharmaceutical sector The Indian pharmaceutical industry is among the most organized industries in India with an estimated worth of US$ 4.5 billion and is growing at about 8% to 9% annually. The Indian pharmaceutical industry also ranks high among the same in developing countries in terms of technology, quality and the vast rang e of products that ar e manufactured: from simple painkillers to sophisticated anti -cancer drugs and comp lex cardiovascular compounds. The industry has the capability to manufacture almost every type of m edi ci ne now requi red in I nd i a. Thus the ph armaceutical industry in India meets over 70% of the country's demand for bulk drug s, drug intermediates, pharmaceutical formulations, chemicals, tablets, capsules, orals and injectibles, etc. The industry, however, is highly fragment ed with over 20 000 registered units currently. It has significantly expanded in th e last two decades. The pharmaceutical and chemical industries in India are a extrem ely fragmented market w i t h s e v e r e p r i c e competition and government price control. There are about 250 large units and 8000 small-scale units, including five central public sector units that form the core of the pharmaceutical industry in the country. Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page 39 Despite widespread poverty and inadequate public health-care provisions, India has much to offer the leading drug-makers. An incr ease in lifestyle diseases resulting from the proliferation of unhealthy diets and junk food consumption combined with a growing middle class that has more disposable income to spend on treatment is poised to provide new opportunities for global pharmaceutical firms. Manufacturing India has emerged as a major supplier of several bulk drugs, producing these at prices lower than those of formulation producers worldwide. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) alread y has approved 85 APIs and formulation plants in India, the highest such nu mber outside of the United States. India is also poised to become a major exporter of pharmaceuticals, particularly generic and over the counter (OTC) drugs, to global markets. By 2010, India could be producing 15% of the world's bulk pharmaceut icals and drug intermediates. However, achieving that level of growth will require an investment of an estimated US$ 1.2 billion in production capacity. With the advantage of being a highly organized sector, the pharmaceutical companies in India are growing at the rate of US$ 4.5 billion, or a growth of about 8% to 9% annually. About 250 lead ing Indian pharmaceutical companies control 70% of the market share with the MNCs still struggling to penetrate the market with new drugs. The Indian pharmaceutical industry is currently the third largest in the world in terms of volume, and 14th in terms of va lue. According to data published by the Department of Pharmaceuticals, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, the total turnover of India's pharmaceuticals industry in 2 008-2009 was US$ 21.04 billion. Of this, the domestic market was worth US$ 12.26 billion. The Indian pharmaceuticals market is expected to touch US$ 55 billion in 2020 fr om US$ 12.6 billion in 2009. The market has the potential to breach the US$ 70 billion mark by 2020 in this current aggressive growth scenario. The drugs and pharmaceuticals sector, th erefore, has attracted foreign direct investment (FDI) worth US$ 1.87 billion between 2000-2010, while hospitals and diagnostic centres have received FDI worth US$ 980.38 million during the same period. Companies such as GE Healthcare plan to invest US$ 50 million to set up more facilities for developing diagnostic services, includ ing anaesthesia, ventilation, computed tomography (CT) systems and molecular imaging, etc., according to several analysts. Generics continue to drive the market. In dia tops the world in exporting generic medicines (worth US$ 11 billion annually at the moment) and currently the Indian pharmaceutical industry is one of the worl d's largest and most developed for generics. Moreover, the Indian generic drug market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 17% between 2010-2011 and 2012-2013 in the foreign markets. Overall, the Indian domestic pharma ceutical market has seen growth at a CAGR of about 12% in the last five years. People of the 67+-year -age-group spend around three to four times more on drugs than people in the younger age-groups. This indicates substantial growth for the pharmaceutical industry. Patented drugs had a 10% market share of the pharmaceutical industry in 2010. Report of a Regional Consultation Page 40 R&D in pharma There are 13 Indian companies which are ac tively engaged in R&D for the development of new drugs. These 13 companies together spent Rs 18 264.6 million on R&D during 2007-2008, which was almost 9% of their tota l turnover. Among the larger spenders as percentage of turnover are Suven (25.64%), (10.96%). The R&D expenditure of these companies has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 34% from Rs 1659.1 million in 1999-2000 to Rs 17 355.8 million in 2007-2008. NCE R&D is not yet a significant part of the R&D activities of Indian companies. Few of the large R&D spenders invest in NCE development. Cipla, for example, is the third largest spender on R& D but yet has no NCE in its portfolio. The R&D spend is still minimal when comp ared with the global pharma. While the 13 Indian companies together spent US$ 454 million in 2007-2008, Pfizer, the largest MNC, alone spent US$ 8.1 billion in 2007. The model that the Indian companies have adopted, rather, is to develop new molecules up to a certain stage and then licence them out to companies abroad, primarily MNCs. According to industry estimates, the Indian pharmaceutical industry (formulations & bulk drugs) is expected to grow at a CAGR of 14.2% to around US$ 50 billion in 2015-2016. Exports driven by contract research are expected to grow at a CAGR of 16.2% while the domestic market is expected to gr ow by 12.5%. In last six years exports, accounting for about 47% of the total indu stry, grew at a CAGR of 27% while the domestic market grew at a CAGR of 14%. The Formulation segment, which constitutes 73% of the total industry, reported a CAGR of 17% while bulk drugs aided by exports g r e w a t 2 8 % . C o n t r a c t r e s e a r c h , a n e w e n t i t y s t i l l i n I n d i a , h a s , h o w e v e r , g r o w n significantly in the past couple of years. To promote R&D in the pharma sector, the Indian government allows 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) under the automatic route in the drugs and pharmaceuticals sector including those involving use of reco mbinant technology (DIPP). The government is also planning to set up a US$ 639.56 million venture capital (VC) fund to give a boost to drug discovery and strengthen the pharma ceutical infrastructure in the country. The MNCs are setting up R&D facility in India. MSD Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd plans to set up a research and development (R&D) centre with UK-based Wellcome Laboratories in India with a total investment of US$ 130 million. Fortis Healthcare has joined hands with technology solutions provid er TotipotentRX Cell Therapy Pvt Limited to set up centres of excellence offering cellular therapies and stem cell clinical trials across select Fortis hospitals. R&D for NCEs being developed by the Indian companies follow the global trend. They are primarily on Type I diseases (13) su ch as diabetes, cancer, heart diseases, asthma and obesity. These diseases clearly have larg er and more attractive market in developed countries, though they are also prevalent in developing countries. The neglected diseases Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page 41 (Type II and III diseases) are absent from the list except for malaria and TB. Even for this the funding is largely from the public sector or philanthropic sources. There is a clear trend towards growing global interest in Indian companies with both the pharma and biotech sectors throwing up as many as five mergers and acquisitions worth US$ 250 million in the recent past. The major challenges for the Indian pharmaceutical industry in the near future include: the impact of the new product pate nt regime; drug price control system; drug regulatory reforms; need for infrastructu re upgradation; quality management; and conforming to global standards such as GMP, GCP, etc. Herbal drugs Traditionally, India has always had a good ma rket potential for Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha and homeopathy (AYUSH) medicines as these traditional medicinal systems are still widely practised, especia lly in rural areas, due to thei r affordability and minimal side- effects. AYUSH is fast moving into the do main of lifestyle drugs, neutraceuticals, cosmoceuticals and other me ans of allied treatment. The Government of India has, therefore, established the Department of AYUSH (Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy) as a new department under the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare for the promotion and development of, and education and research in, these Indian systems of Medicine . This is in addition to the individual councils established in each of the AYUSH se ctors to safeguard the traditional procedures of treatments. These councils look into deve lopments in treatment and infrastructure development, consider the establishment of hospitals and medical colleges in their respective fields, and encourage research activities besides setting up appropriate regulatory structures to ensure the safety of medicines. The market for products under the ISM indi genous systems of medicines category in India in 2004-2005 was estimated to be worth US$ 400 million. Of these, over 82% was in the Ayurveda sector and 14% in homeopathy . Herbal health care and the personal care market in India is estimated to be between US$ 550 million and US$ 650 million. In addition to AYUSH products, a huge services market has emerged in the last few years. India's total export of AYUSH products during 2004-2005 was US$ 23.3 million, about 8% more than in 2003-2004. The industry is currently dominated by about 30 companies, each with revenue of over US$ 1 million. There are over 20 000 manufacturing units most of which are small or micro. The industry is currently dominated by about 30 companies, each with a revenue of over US$ 1 million. Most of the large companies offer FMCG (fast-moving c o n s u m e r g o o d s ) p r o d u c t s w i t h h e r b a l ingredients along with ISM medicinal products. Opportunity in the AYUSH sector in India la rgely lies in the suppl y of raw materials. The AYUSH identified about 1500 medicinal plants of which 500 are used in the preparation of drugs. The National Medicinal Plant Board (NMPB) has also identified 32 Report of a Regional Consultation Page 42 prioritized medicinal plants which are in dema nd for both the national and international markets. AYUSH has many issues to be addressed and challenges to be met for its growth in India and for export. Pricing of the drugs and other products continues to be a major issue. Quality is still a concern as no systematic clinical trials are conducted in terms of drug dosage. Hence the Drugs Controller of In dia has not been able to address the issue of pricing of these drugs. Most of the 20 000 units that manufacture alternative medicines are neither registered with the department of AYUSH nor follow good manufacturing practices for drug preparation. Inconsistency of quality, policy issues, technology modernization, and competition with allopathic drugs are some of the other challenges faced by the ISM. In order to harness the potential in this market, a few is sues that need to be addressed include IPR protection systems for traditional medicines, disseminating correct knowledge about herbal drugs, proper and adequate scientific documentation, and proving the safety and efficacy of drugs through large clinical trials. Medical devices Medical devices are health-care products that achieve their primary intended purpose by not being metabolized. Medical devices incl ude electromedical equipment and related software, furniture, supplies and consumables, orthopaedic appliances, prosthetics and diagnostic kits, reagents and other equipment. Medical devices are classified according to their medical utility or technical design and manufacturing aspects. However, regulatory authorities across the world have classified them based on their safety requ irements and standards of quality to be achieved. Several criteria ar e considered to evaluate th e potential risk: degree of invasiveness, duration of contact, affected body systems and local versus systemic effects. The classification of medical devices differs from country to country as given below: Table 8: Classification of medical devices in various countries Europe US FDA GHTF (Japan) Examples of medical devices included Class I Class I Class A Non-sterile items or sterile items with a low potential risk: surgical instruments, urine bags, stethoscope, examination gloves. Class IIa Class II Class B Sterile items, surgical gloves, urinary catheters, stomach tubes, needles, tracheal tubes, IV sets Class IIb Class II Class C Blood bags, condoms, non-absorbable sutures, anaesthesia machines Class III Class D Absorbable sutures Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page 43 In India medical, dental and surgical equi pment constitute the largest segment with about 40% to 50% share of the market. Plastic and disposables make up 25% to 30% of the market and the remaining 20% to 25% of market share is held by implants and medicated implants such as cardiac stents. In the light of its widespread applicability, the medical devices market has registered a steady growth. Currently valued at US$ 220 billion, the huge global market is expected to drive the Indian market as demographics and market drivers step up the demand for new and innovative product offe rings at affordable prices. Imports continue to constitute over 50% of the market. Most imported products are sold at high profit margins. However, the market is becoming increasingly competitive due to low entry barriers for MNCs, an incr easing number of players and an expanding consumer base. By value, imports are about three times the exports. In India the medical devices sector makes up only 15% of the total pharmaceutical market as against 28% worldwide, indicating un derutilization of medical devices in Indian health care. This also indicates a large untapped market. The regulation of medical devices is comple x with legal technicali ties. In India, the Department of Health has the jurisdiction over medical devices through the Drugs Controller-General of India (DCGI). But as is evident from the large-scale illegal reprocessing and repackaging of used syringes for resale and the easy availability of equipment that fail minimum safety and quality standards - including unsterilized implants that cause infection and stents coat ed with immuno-suppressant drugs that could impair the body's immune syst em - a lot needs to be done. All medical devices carry a certain degree of inherent risk. Therefore, the Global Harmonization Task Force (GHTF) has identified potential areas of danger to patients that warrant consideration. These include the degree of invasiveness, the duration of contact, the body system affected, and the local-versus -systemic effects. An invasive device is usually considered to have a higher potential hazard than an equivalent non-invasive one. Similarly, devices that have a long duration of contact are assigned higher classes of potential hazard or risk. The medical technology market in India wa s worth an estimated US$ 2.75 billion in 2008, a growth of approximately 14% over 20 07. The market is expected to reach US$ 5 billion by 2012 with an annual growth rate of nearly 15%. However, the data are not well documented in the Indian context. Estimates of the market size, therefore, vary from US$ 1.9 billion in 2009 to US$ 3 billion in 2010. The global medical devices and equipment market is estimated to be at US$ 215 billion in 2008, and has grown at a CAGR of 4.5% during the period 2004-2008. The Indian medical equipment and supplies market during 2008 was estimated at US$ 2.75 billion, with an annual growth of 14% since 2003. Report of a Regional Consultation Page 44 Medical instruments and appliances used in specialized procedures such as ophthalmic, dental and other physiological cases account for almost 25% of the total market. The other major segments include the orthopaedic/prosthetic goods segment (20% of total market share), medical supplies (12.4%), high-end speciality electromedical equipment (10.2%), and X-ray apparatus (9.4%). Diagnostic kits continue worth almost US$ 300 million were traded during 2008, marking a growth rate of 30% to 35% over the previous year. Overall imports continue to cons titute to over 50% of the Indian market. Some key growth drivers for the medical technology industry in India include: (i) rising economy; (ii) increasing health -care spending; (iii) increasing health-care expenditure; (iv) shift in the demographic profile; (v) changes in disease profile and increase in lifestyle diseases; (vi) spurt in diseases such as ophthalmologic, cancers, cardiovascular, diabetes and renal diseases ; and (vii) neurologic al and other mental disorders; as well as (viii) growing cases of addiction to psychotropic substances. Some opportunities and challenges for the medical devices sector include: (1) increasing dependence on imports for supply of medical devices; (2) inadequate and unclear re gulatory environment; (3) low level of health-care insurance; (4) inadequate health-care facilities and awareness in rural and semi-urban areas. Oral health In India, oral health care constitutes an im portant segment of overall health care and its relevance is rising with more and more peop le becoming aware of the need for the same. The most common oral diseases in India include dental caries and DMFT 27(that occurs in almost 60% of 15-year-olds and over 80% among adults in the age-group of 35- 44 years), periodontal and other gum diseases (in almost 70% of young people and as much as 90% among >35-year-olds), malo cclusion or crooked tooth (affecting 30% to 4 0 % of I nd ian chi ld ren) , ri si ng nu mbers of oral cancer cases and pre-cancerous lesions (almost 10 in every 100 000 males and females), rising instances of dental abscess, bad breath and tooth discolouration. The dentist-population ratio in 2008 was 1:10 000 in urban India and 1:250 000 in rural areas. As far as the overall ratio of dent ists to the general population is concerned, there was a marked improvement between 2005 and 2008, from 1:42 500 to 1:16 120. There are about 280 dental colleges with over 15 000 dentists being produced each year. Of these, almost 140 colleges also offer postgr aduate degrees in various fields of dentistry. 27 DMFT and DMFS describe the prevalence of dental caries in an individu al. DMFT and DMFS are means to numerically express the caries prevalence and are obtained by calcu lating the number of decayed (D), missing (M), filled (F) teeth (T) or surfaces (S). Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page 45 The Indian dental care services market and dental ancillary services grew at a CAGR of 11.37% during 2004-2008. It is expected to touch US$ 660 million in 2009. Currently, the Indian dental equipment and appliances market was estimated at US$ 87 million. Due to the increasing awareness about person al hygiene the dental/oral care market has been growing rapidly over the past deca de and in 2009 touched US$ 1 billion. The segment is largely dominated by three pr oducts: toothpastes (US$ 0.5 billion), toothbrushes (13%) an d toothpowder (12%). The global dental industry market continues to be lucrative and enjoys a high degree of competition. It was estimated to be around US$ 18 billion in 2009 (excluding large equipments) and is growing at around 6.5% . The dental consumables market was US$ 11 billion in 2009. The United States enjoys the largest share (37%) of the global dental consumables market, followed by Europe (32% ). Japan's dental equipment market had a share of 14% of the global and rest of Asia has a share of around 7%. India is a net importer of dental equi pment and supplies and the major dental imports in 2008-2009 included dental furnit ure (US$ 940 million), dental instruments (US$ 18.92 million) and radiation apparatus (US$ 10.27 million). India's major dental exports include dental furniture (US$ 297.31 million), dental hygiene preparations (US$ 54.71 million), and surgical wound closures (US$ 8.43 million). The Indian dental equipment industry is expected to reach US$ 116.43 million by 2014 with an annual growth of 6%, according to industry estimates. Similarly, the dental care services market is also expected to touch US$ 1.16 billion and oral care market US$ 2 billion by 2014. In India, awareness about oral health is st ill not up to desired levels. Some tangible degree of improvement in dental health care has been observed in the past decade through measures such as water fluoridation, introduction of fluoride toothpastes and growing awareness about dental hygiene. Ho wever, there is scope for considerable improvement yet. 8.3 Indonesia: Dr Martuti Budiharto, Pharmacist, National Institute of Health R & D, Jakarta, Indonesia The status of the pharmaceutical sector in Indonesia is outlined in Annex 3. Dr Martuti Budiharto explained that her repo rt is to fulfil the deliverables for identifying priority areas under resolution WHA 61.21 by ascertaining status of pharmaceuticals, herbal medicines, dental formulations and medical technologies in Indonesia. To prepare a focused regional and co untry-specific national action plan for the countries of the SEA region, the data colle ction was conducted through interviews of Report of a Regional Consultation Page 46 several stakeholders in related areas, and a thorough review of documents from libraries and websites28. Indonesia has been implementing a decentra lization policy for public health since 2001. The revised decentralization law of 2004 delegates authority in health services to the districts. This covers the authority for procurement of medicines. However, on the other hand, the government has not yet encour aged the establishment of pharmaceutical companies outside of Java Island. Pharmaceutical companies are the main sour ce for medicine supply, providing more than 90% of the domestic need, and thus also contributing significantly to Indonesian economic growth. The government's policy at the moment encour ages free competition among pharmaceutical companies. Therefore, there is no restriction in establishing pharmaceutical companies, or on production, even of generic products. This has resulted in the emergence of several pharmaceutical brands, and the price of medicine is determined by the market. There are four st ate-owned pharmaceutical companies: Kimia Farma, Indonesia Farma, Bio Farma and Phapro s. Bio Farma has a specific qualification for producing vaccine s and sera only. The main products of the other companies are generic medicines for public supply. At the beginning of the implementation of th e generic drugs prescribing policy, there was reluctance and disbelief among most doctor s due to the very low price of generic medicines. The Ministry of Health slowly improved the image of generic medicines by social marketing, community promotion, and through efficacy-proven evidence. Since the financial crisis of 1997, generic medicines beca me the only products eligible to meet 80% of the community's needs. This was supplemen ted by the implementation of the National Drug Policy, National Essential Drugs List, generic prescribing, etc. The state-owned companies are the backbone of the production of more or less 200 generic medicines by the Mi nistry of Health (legislation law No. 1799/2010). 28 Pharmaceuticals data Respondents: 1.

Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page 47 Major research institutes in Indonesia conduct various health researches. These include the National Agency for Assessment and Application Technology (NAAAT), Indonesian Institute of Science (IIS), Inst itute for Human Virology and Cancer Biology (IHVCB), National Institute of Health Rese arch and Development (NIHRD), as well as research and development units in pharmaceut ical companies. The Ministry of Research and Technology is a coordinating body for research activities. There is also a National Research Board (NRB) which promotes, maintain s and prioritizes research activities in Indonesia. There is a Directorate-General of Intellectua l Property Rights (DG of IPR) under the Ministry of Law and Human Rights. DG of IPR has ratified several international treaties, and these include the agreement establishing the World Trade Organization in 1994, Patent Cooperation Treaty of 1997, the Trademark Law Treaty of 1997, the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary an d Artistic Works of 1997, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1997 and the WIPO Performances an d Phonograms Treaty of 2004.The role of IPR in the modern era is to support technologi cal products as creations of the people for the benefit of the people. Pharmaceutical companies have grown enor mously since Indonesia applied for an open policy to foreign investment in 19 80. In 1970 there were only about 150 pharmaceutical companies; the number increased to 224 companies in 1995 but later decreased to 193 during the financial crisis of 1997. Currently the number of pharmaceutical companies is 203 and they are categorized into joint venture companies (12), state-owned companies (4), and loca l companies (187). The standard for pharmaceutical raw material is the Indonesia Pharmacopoeia, the last edition of which was published in 2007. Many research institutions had begun to explore medicinal herbs to generate raw material. The standard for herbal medici nal plants is the Indonesian Herbal Pharmacopoeia published by the Ministry of Health, the first edition of which was in 2008. Besides, the NIHRD published the Vademecum of Traditional Medicines in 2010. A large population in Indonesia, especially in Java island, usually uses traditional medicine. One traditional medicine type is called jamu, a powder or solutions mix of various kinds of medicinal herb s. According to the Directorat e-General of Pharmaceutical Services and Medical Devices, Ministry of Health, there are 91 traditional medicine companies in Indonesia. In general, Indonesia has no medical de vices industry. Most medical devices are imported from other countries. Locally only spare parts for instruments are manufactured. Data from the DG of Pharmaceutical Services and Medical Devices (2010) shows there are 20 large companies, 246 small industries and 869 distributors for medical devices. In 1991-2009 the number of applications for patent were 76 831; these included 70 253 from foreign countries and 6578 from Indonesia. Of thes e 6578 applications, about 3600 came from the health sector. According to information from Directorate- General of IPR, Ministry of Law and Human Ri ghts, the health applications were related to medicines, vaccines, cosmetics, biological agents, pesticides, etc. These were from both Indonesia as well as foreign countries. Thes e foreign counties included United States, Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerl and, the United Kingdom, France, the Republic of Korea and Australia. Report of a Regional Consultation Page 48 Annex 3 lists the number of pharmaceutical companies at the time of the study at 203, herbal medicines industries at 79, an d also states that there are 1395 small and medium enterprises for herbal medicines. Th e number of dental formulation companies was 21, and there were 20 companies for medical devices. According to the Directorate-General of Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices there were 246 companies listed as \"inventor co mpanies\", 869 as \"distributors\" and 91 as \"herbal medicines\". There is no information about investment in plant and machinery in pharmaceuticals, traditional herbs, dent al formulations and medical devices. The formulation production of pharmaceuticals was around 16 000, but only 15 411 medicines have registered in National Ag ency of Drug and Food Control (NADFC) in various dosage forms. In 2010 the formulat ion production of herbal medicines was 14 445 items, while dental formulations tota lled only 145 items during 2008-2010. The projected growth in production (20 11-2014) for pharmaceuticals is about US$ 12.7 billion, and retail sales about US$ 4.6 bi llion for medical technologies. The volume of imports of pharmaceuticals in 2009-2010 was US$ 133 million. Medical technologies have a 15% projected growth for imports an d 5% projected growth for exports in 2011- 2014. Regarding the parameter of the number of pharmaceutical companies/units adhering to GMP criteria stipulated by WH O, NADFC reports the number to be 203, and there is no information on herbal medicine companies as well as dental formulation companies. The Indonesian Medical Devices Companies Association noted only 16 of 20 companies to be adhering to GMP criteria stipulated by WHO. Summary of recommendations to Government of Indonesia and WHO-SEARO (1) Each of the 25 sub-Elements outlined in Template A are of highest relevance to the country (Scale 4). (2) Indonesia has enough resources for IPR and the necessary regulations are already in place. (3) Collaboration and coordination among st akeholders should be encouraged. (4) Most pharmaceutical companies are located in Java Island; and this reflects a significant development gap between islands. This condition will have consequences on equal access to pharmaceuticals and will lead to maldistribution of expertise at places outside Java. The scope of traditional medicine is very promising. The go vernment, therefore, has to support research on traditional herbs leading to obtaining patents. (5) The Ministry of Research and Technology (MRT) is the coordinating body to enforce compliance of research instit utes. The MRT has developed a national research agenda that should be followed by research institutions, and also has a role in strengthening research manageme nt and facilitate technology transfer to secure IPR and achieve patent products. Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page 49 (6) The research institutions as well as the government and private sector are able to communicate to the D-G IPR, Minist ry of Law and Human Rights, to seek information on patent certification. The NIHRD (responsible for health R&D) should encourage studies on public health innovation, especially on i n d i g e n o u s k n o w l e d g e s u c h a s o n h e r b al medicine. The NIARD (responsible for agriculture R&D) should encour age upstream studies on medicinal plants/herbal medicines to regulate the quality of raw material. (7) The Ministry of Health (MoH) is developing a roadmap for creating pharmaceutical products to overcome diseases such as: - Communicable disease : vaccines, drugs or diagnostic kits. - Noncommunicable disease: model of in tervention in the field, including legislation. (8) The MRT and technical ministries must also expand the scope of South-South collaboration on R&D, especially in the production of vaccines, drugs and traditional medicines, as well as collabo ration with UN agencies for capacity- building on R&D. Table 9 shows that in Indonesia there are 91 big medical herb companies distributed in eight provinces located on thr ee islands. Similar is the situation with the location of pharmaceutical companies. However, the NADFC has explained that there are 2358 traditional medicine industries, which include 1454 Indonesian industries, 153 American, 227 Chinese and 138 Malaysian. The number of traditional medicines registered is 6895 items. 29 Table 9: Number of traditional/herbal medicine industries in Indonesia* No. Province Total 1. North Sumatra 3 2. South Sumatra 2 3.

Report of a Regional Consultation Page 50 8.4 Sri Lanka: Prof. Rohini Fern andopulle, Professor in Clinical Pharmacology, Faculty of Medici ne, University of Colombo The status of the pharmaceutical sector in Sri Lanka is outlined in Annex 4. The pharmaceutical scenario in Sri Lanka The pharmaceutical market in Sri Lanka is on e of the smallest in the South-East Asia Region on account of the size of the popula tion. Globally, Sri Lanka ranks 67th out of the 83 markets surveyed as part of the ever-e xpanding pharmaceutical universe. However, the Business Monitor International (BMI) forecasts that the country's overall pharmaceutical expenditure will post a CAGR of 12.1% in local currency terms till through to 2014 to reach Sri Lankan Ru pee 68.98 billion (US$ 657 million). The Government of Sri Lanka strongly enco urages the prescribing of generic drugs with the mission of making medicines affordab le and more accessible. Currently around 90% of the demand for pharmaceutical prod ucts is met through imports. However, dependence on imports has been recently shaken by an epidemic of low-quality imported medicines. Issues of quality of imported medicines has led to shortages of essential medicines in the public sector, and loss of confidence in generic medicines by health-care professionals and consumers, and has also cost the Sri Lankan government US$ 3.96mn in 2009 - an increase of more than 106% on 2008 - according to a report submitted to Parliament by the Auditor-Gener al. Therefore, this report is timely in promoting the need for developing a national ac tion plan and identifying national priority areas in GSPA. Regulation of pharmaceuticals Allopathic medicines The legislative framework for regulation of a llopathic medicines is the Cosmetic Devices and Drugs Act No. 27 of 1980 and the Regulations of 1984. The areas covered by the Act include the pre-market assessment and evaluation o f t h e q u a l i t y , s a f e ty a nd e f f i c a c y o f medicines, including compliance of manu facturing sites and pr ocesses with good manufacturing practices and standards; and the maintenance of a register of available drugs, licensing of all manufacturers, import ers, retail and wholesale dealers of drugs, transporters of drugs, and all promotion and advertising of drugs. The Cosmetic Devices and Drugs Authority (CDDA) is the controlling body for the implementation of GMP in the local manufacture of allopathic medicines. As the Cosmetic Devices and Drugs Act of 1980 specifically excludes Ayurveda and homeopathic medicines, the CDDA is not invo lved in the implementa tion of GMP in the manufacturing sites of traditional medicine s. The allopathic medicine manufacturing facilities are required to closely adhere to the requirements of GMP as laid down by WHO. One of the key objectives of the draft National Medicines Policy is to promote the local manufacture of essential medicines Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page 51 Traditional medicines Traditional medicines in Sri Lanka include Ayurvedic, Siddha and Unani medicines, and acupuncture and homeopathy treatments. The National Policy on Traditional Medicines and Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) is currently being developed. Laws and regulations on traditional medicines/CA M were issued in 1961, and the national programme was initiated in 1982. The Department of Ayurveda in the Ministry of Health was established in 1961. The National Expert Committee and a National Research Institute on Traditional Medicine, Complementary Medicine and Herbal Medicine were established in 1962. The National Pharmacopoeia and the Ayurveda Pharma copoeia were published in 1979. The Compendium of Medicinal Plants contains 100 national monographs and was published in 2002. The information contained therein is considered to be legally binding. No traditional medicine has been included in the National Essential Medicines List. Intellectual property rights (9) In the past Sri Lanka did not face any rigours of strong patent systems. The future situation could be totally different, with the formation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the enforcement of the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights Agreement in 1990. Sri Lanka is a founder signatory to the TRIPS Agreement. As a developing country the IPR regime has been applicable in Sri Lanka from 2005. Currently the pharmaceutical registration process in Sri Lanka under the CDDA does not recognize IPR status as a criterion. The current Sri Lanka IPR Act enforced in 2003 incorporates the provisions of the TRIPS Agreement. Section 62 and 63 comply with Article 27 of TRIPS and Section 86 with Articles 30 and 31 of TRIPS. It is proposed that a co-relation between the pharmaceutical policy and patent laws has to be established to the maxi mum extent so that the industry is able to play its role adequately to facilitate easy access to medicines at competitive prices. A recent study on the patent status of new chem ical entities (NCEs) suggests that none of the NCEs registered from 2006-2010 are patented in Sri Lanka. Local manufacture Allopathic medicines In Sri Lanka, the local allopathic pharmaceutical manufacturing industry is very small. All the medicines manufactured by the local indust ry are generics and account for just over 10% of the total medicine consumption in the country. There are only nine local manufacturers which include Glaxo and Smit hKline Beecham. These two companies are the subsidiaries of foreign companies. Inter-Pharma is another pharmaceutical company which manufactures pharmaceuticals on license from a foreign company. Report of a Regional Consultation Page 52 In addition to these three companies whic h have foreign links, there are only six other pharmaceutical manufacturing companies, one of which is the State Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC). SPMC is th e only state-sector corporation engaged in manufacturing pharmaceut icals in Sri Lanka. The data and basic analysis of the pharmaceutical, herbal/traditional medical sector, and dental and medical technologies in the country are described in Template B. Traditional medicines The Ayurvedic Drug Corporation is the biggest single manufacturer of Ayurvedic drugs in the country. The corporation exports lo cally available crude drugs and locally manufactured drugs to foreign countries. A variety of items for Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani systems of medicine are manufact ured. These include the production of rasa medicines (metallic preparations). With regard to research in Ayurvedic dr ugs very little innovative R&D has been carried out. The corporation also imports an d sells Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani products (both raw and manufactured drugs). The corporation maintains an Ayurvedic herbaria and grows some indigenous vari eties of Ayurvedic herbs requ ired for the manufacture of drugs. Regulatory requirements for manufacturing include adherence to information in the pharmacopoeia and monographs as well as the same GMP rules that apply to conventional pharmaceuticals. However, no control mechanism exists for these requirements. There are no post-m arketing safety requirements. Quality control is done but it is to a limited extent by the corporation and is far from adequate. Sri Lanka is a member of the Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Network of National Centers of Coordination in Traditional Medicine. Sri Lanka has been dele gated the task of designing \"Collaborative research on traditional medicine among BIMSTEC countries\". Devices No devices are manufactured in Sri Lanka no r are there any plans for the same in the near future. Dental Currently only toothpaste is manufactured locally. Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page 53 Obstacles to local production and transfer of pharmaceutical-related technology: Allopathic medicine (1) There is an acute shortage of pharmacists in the CDDA for conducting activities related to regulation of allo pathic medicines. There are only nine permanent and three contract pharmacists overlooking all aspects of regulation. In addition to the acute sh ortage of human resources the technical skills available for GMP inspections are inadequate. (2) C u r r e n t l y t h e r e i s n o m a n u f a c t u r e o f p a r e n t e r a l d o s a g e f o r m s . O n l y o r a l dosage forms are manufactured locally. The human expertise and infrastructure available for producti on of parenteral dosage forms are inadequate. (3) There are very limited R&D activities and these are mainly in formulation development. At present there is no ma nufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredients, all of which are imported. As no basic innovative R&D activities are undertaken by local manufacturers, IP T issues have so far not arisen in the country. (4) There are no national barriers to techno logy transfer for the manufacture of medicines in the country. There are also multinational pharmaceutical companies in Sri Lanka, but no transfer of technology has taken place till date. There have been no instances of co mpulsory licensing and manufacture. (5) Issues identified by local manufacturers include the following: (a) No declared pharmaceutical industri al policy for local manufacture. (b) Inadequate lobbying and debate by local manufacturers with the Ministry of Health when compared with importers of medicines. (c) Very little R&D collaboration with academia. (d) Tariff protection not in place as is the case with other industries. (e) Price is the only criterion for winning government bids. (f) Rate of taxation for manufacturers vis-\u00e0-vis taxes on importation of pharmaceuticals. (g) Lack of proper training on WHO-mandated GMPs. (h) Lack of formulation expertise. (i) No government support for training of private sector employees. Report of a Regional Consultation Page 54 Traditional medicines There is an immediate need for R&D and deve lopment of quality control mechanisms in this area. More collaboration is needed with academia. Conclusion and recommendations Although it is not cheaper to manufacture medicines locally than to import them, Sri Lanka in recent times has faced an epidemic of imported sub-standard medicines which has led to shortages of several essential and crit ical medicines. Thus from a public health perspective, the developmental gains are greate st if local production increases the supply of good quality and affordable essential medicines. The decision to support local manufacture of pharmaceuticals should spec ifically address the question of which medicines should be produced locally. The C DDA should also provide a list of good candidate medicines for local production base d on what is registered and also where there is no registered source. Local firms currently manufa cture medicines which are sustainable but they may also need to produce drugs other than those id entified in order to be sustainable in the long run as a public health service. Sri Lank a needs to build their human resource base in relevant fields such as industrial pharmacy and chemistry. Training in good manufacturing practices is an urgent need for both the publ ic and private sector involved in allopathic and traditional medicine manufacture. Colla borative research between allopathic and traditional medicine should be encouraged. 8.5 Thailand: Ms Chutima Akaleephan, Researcher, International Health Policy Programme, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand The status of the pharmaceutical sector in Thailand is outlined in Annex 5. Thailand's population was 65.4 million in 2010 (National Statistical Office 2011) and nearly 95% are Buddhists, followed by Mu slims (4.5%), Christians and others. Based on the latest country profile, the crude birt h rate and crude mortality rates are 10.9 and 6.8 per 1000 population respectively. As a result, the natural growth rate is 0.4. Male life expectancy at birth is 69.9 while that fo r females is 77.6. Like developed and some developing countries, Thailand is gradually becoming an ageing society (Economic and Social Statistics Bureau 2007; Ekachampaka and Taverat 2008). Due to the steady increase in gross national income (GNI) per capita - currently at US$ 4210 - Thailand was upgraded from the lower-income coun try category to the upper-middle income category as per the World Bank's classification in 2011. The research and development system Many organizations and institutes are engaged in research and development ( see Annex 6). Research institutes in the Ministry of Science and Technology, in particular the Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page 55 National Science and Technology Develo pment Agency (NSTDA) - which is the managing centre for its research institutes an d research units in universities - are the key research hubs of the country ( Figure 1 ). However, along the process of research through production, several agencies get involved, i.e. policy-makers, civil society and consumer groups, researchers and manufacturers with R&D units, funding agencies, and R&D management. National policy and roadmap The National Science Technology and Innovati on Policy Office is the main body for national policy development and plans of action. Currently, the 2012-2021 National Policy and Plan on Science Technology and Innovation is being finalized. Analysis on R&D through production capacity There is fragmented information on evaluati on of R&D capacity on health products. Studies and systematic analysis were fo und in modern medicines (pharmaceutical products) and vaccines. (1) Medicines and pharmaceutical products So far, no drug has passed through all steps of R&D, from target discovery to manufacturing, in Thailand. Furthermore, in the aspect of diseases and public health problems, Maleewong U., et al identified 231 researches which are able to link their indications to diseases during the past decade (1999-2010). Of these, 33.8%, 22.9% and 8.2% are researches for type I, II and III diseases, 30 respectively. The other researches (35.1%) relate to other diseases in general. About 64% of R&D for Type I dise ases related to anti-c ancer drugs; 34% to Type II related to anti-retrovirals; and 89.5 % to type III related to anti-malarial drugs (Maleewong, Isulpisalkul, et al. 2011 ). Unfortunately there is no evidence reve aling the magnitude of indicators of Thailand's capacity in patent holders as well as transfer of technology. For instance, 14 process and/or product pate nts and petty patents belong to NSTDA, Chulalongkorn University and Mahidol University. A patent is also jointly held by Chiang Mai University and an international drug company. On transfer technology, there is the case of transfer from NSTDA to a French raw material produc er. The GPO transferred the technology on production from Chinese an d Indian drug companies ( Maleewong, Isulpisalkul, et al. 2011 ). 30 Since the definition on types of diseases is broadly defined and non-specific to di sease, this study additionally categorized diseases to these three types: Type I diseases include cancer, DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, influenza, hepatitis B and C, and cardiovascular diseases. Type II diseases include AIDS, TB, hepa titis A, infectious diseases, meningitis, rabies, etc. Type III diseases include African sleeping sickness, African river blin dness, dengue haemorrhagic fever, malaria, etc. Report of a Regional Consultation Page 56 It was suggested that owing to lack of all types of resources and capacity for R&D on active pharmaceutical ingredients, Thailand should strengthen capacity on downstream research for manufacturing in the future. (2) Herbal medicines Traditional and herbal medicines are addressed and highlighted in the 10th National Economic and Social Development Plan as well as other policies and strategies on health. The Department for the Development of Thai Traditional and Alternative Medicine was established in 2002 under the Ministry of Publ ic Health in order to promote use, improve quality and protect such knowledge which form s part of Thai heritage (Department for Development of Traditional and Alternative Medicine, 2011). As a result of the differences in the ph ilosophy of science and the concept of treatment, R&D on herbal medicines is more simply classified into basic research (targeting crude extracts and standard extrac ts), preclinical trials, clinical trials and production. For publications on modern medici nes, 24.8% of 1093 publications relate to basic research, 73.4% pre-clinical, 1.7% clinical and 0.1% to production. Regarding types of diseases, it was reported that the proportion of research for Type I is equal to that for Type II (32.3% and 32.8% respectively) whereas only 0.2% of all research relates to Type III diseases. Regardin g patent grants, 20 patents and petty patents are identified and all belong to research unit s and universities. Hence, most of the herbal medicine supply is limited to internal demand; the technology transfer of herbal medicines being usually from public research institutes to local producers. Major concerns on herbal medicines include reference standard s as well as the quality and uniformity of raw materials ( Maleewong, Isulpisa lkul, et al. 2011 ). (3) Vaccines During the past decade (1999-2010), 222 resear ches relating to biological products were carried out, which could be categorized into 83% related to vaccines, 1% to immune serum, 2% to antivenom and 41% to human protein. Many vaccines are in the R&D pipeline and some are in the production pr ocess. However, at present, none of the vaccines are thoroughly researched, developed and produced in Thailand. Most vaccines are imported for clinical trials and are likely to be sponsored by drug companies. Muangchana C., et al conducted a situation analysis of all vaccines in 2009. Their categorization into a group current un der manufacture with conventional methods and a group in the R&D pipeline is summarized in Tables 3 and 4.

Source: Adapted from Table 4 of Siripitayakunkit, Muangchana, et al. 2009. Report of a Regional Consultation Page 58 All vaccines indicated in Table 4 are researched and developed by national research institutes in government organizations or academic institutes. Some projects are expected to be a collaboration between the public and private sector (public-private partnership (PPP)), or North-South collaboration (betw een developed and developing countries). Table 5 summarizes such partnerships and collaboration. (Siripitayakunkit, Muangchana, et al. 2009; Maleewong, Isulpisalkul, et al. 2011) . Table 12: R&D of vaccines and technology transfer National level International level Public-public Public-private American cockroach DTP-Hep B Vaccines are the only health products that have a national policy, strategies and a centre for comprehensive management. Strate gies were set up for all aspects, i.e. promoting R&D, domestic production, quality assurance and quality control, immunization, and inter-organizational collaboration. Five vaccines (JE, dengue, influenza, DTP-Hep. B and TB) were prioritized and R&D roadmaps drawn for each (Muangchana, Siripitayakunkit, et al. Maleewong, Isulpisalkul, et al. 2011 ). However, limitations were reported in each aspect along the R&D and production stages depending on the specific requiremen ts of each vaccine. There are some common problems that R&D and vaccine production will confront. These in clude lack of some animal species, primate and ferret, required in preclinical trials; pilot plants for scaling up vaccine production from the laboratory scales; grants for product development for market competition; and availability of experts in scaling up vaccine, in vaccine formulation for final bulk products, and in quality control (Siripitayakunkit, Muangchana et al. 2009). (4) Diagnostic tests Two types of the tests were identified, i.e. diagnostic reagents using automatic test machines and diagnostic test kits. During 1 999-2010, two thirds of 99 publications were for diagnostic test kits. When classified by ty pes of disease, 83% of researches were found to be for Type II diseases which are mostly infectious or genetic diseases. These include thalassemia, elephantiasis, melioidosis, dengue , leptospirosis, malaria, HIV, hepatitis and tuberculosis. Twenty eight patents and petty patents were reported. The problem with transfer of technology related to these diseases is that these products are not of interest to the private sector because of lack of marketin g potential. In addition, domestic tests will yield less profits than imported goods. Thus, the investment in production scale is based on the public sector ( Maleewong, Isulpisalkul, et al. 2011 ). Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page 59 (5) Medical equipment Medical equipment is defined differently from medical supplies (condoms, rubber gloves, syringes, etc.) for whic h case Thailand is a net export er. Equipment requires medium-to- advanced and harmonized technology. It was mainly divided into five groups, i.e. robots and medical automation; biomaterials; medica l and public health software; biosignal monitoring devices; and medical image devices. Of 123 researches, 15.4% involved robots and medical automation; 7.3% were in medical image devices; and that re st comprised 18.7%. Publication from the SCOPUS 31 database indicated an up ward trend in biomedical engineering research in Thailand since 2004, NECTEC cited in Maleewong, Isulpisalkul, et al. 2011 . Fifty one patents and petty patents were recorded, of which Chulalongkorn University and Mahidol University held 44 patents whereas seven belo nged to NSTDA. All the technology transfer is a type of public to private for commercial purpose. Resources and infrastructure The proportion of the total R&D expenditure to GDP was between 0.21% to 0.26% between 2002 and 2008. Thailand falls below th e world average on this score, it being 1.01% to 1.30%. The figure is also less than that for Malaysia, India, Singapore and China. In 2008, Thailand showed additional scarcity with other indicators, that is, with the least ratios of private-public R&D expenditure (0.08% versus an average of 0.63%); full-time equivalent of R&D personnel per population (6.8 FTE versus 24.9 FTE per 10 000 population); and FTE of R&D personnel in the private sector (1.07 FTE versus 14.32 FTE per 10 000 population) [ IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook cited in Durongkavaeroj, 2010]. In monetary terms, it was estimated that the total expenditure for R&D in 2007 was 18 225 million Baht in which the government's share was 10 015 million Baht and that of the private sector was 8210 million Baht. Fu rther, the 2008 survey revealed that the estimated expenditure on R&D in the manu facturing sector was 7278.40 million Baht, which is a 9% decrease from the 2006 survey (7998.63 million Baht) (National Science Technology and Innovation Policy Office 2011; National Science Technology and Innovation Policy Office 2011). This inform ation indicated that compared to the public sector, the private sector spent more on R& D in Thailand. However, this current data provided very limited information. It could not reveal trends of R&D expenditure or the proportion as well as specific information on health products. On promotion on R&D and biotechnology as well as production of medicines/active pharmaceutical ingredients, the Board of In vestment (BoI) provides an incentive for foreign and domestic investment. R&D and biot echnology activities are classified as a 31 Scopus, now officially named SciV erse Scopus, is a bibliographic database contai ning abstracts and citations for scholarly jou rnal articles. Report of a Regional Consultation Page 60 priority on account of their special import ance and the benefits they provide to the country. While R&D includes basic rese arch, applied science and experimental development; biotechnology includes R&D and manufacturing based on such technology. In general, the incentives for R&D include mainly tax incentives, i.e. exemption of import duties on machinery; and eight-year corporate income tax exemption. In addition, the Revenue Department provid es incentives such as a 200% tax deduction for R&D expenses and accelerated depreciation rates for R&D machinery and equipment. Specifically, biotechnology activities locate d in science and technology parks will be granted a five-year additional 50% corporate in come tax reduction for net profits after the end of the corporate income tax exemption period. Production of medicines or active pharma ceutical ingredients is classified as a priority activity. As a result, the business wi ll be granted similar tax exemption except the eight-year corporate income tax exemption which is subject to a cap (and no additional benefits according to the geographical zone wh ere the activity is located) (Thailand Board of Investment 2011; The Revenue Department 2011). Limitations and constraints Limitations of and concerns regarding R&D we re reflected by experts in each technical area through in-depth interviews. Apart from limitations mentioned earlier with many of the health products, Maleewong U., et al addressed the constraints that were common across entities, such as lack of a national po licy and coordinator to direct and target the R&D except for vaccines; insufficient investme nt in infrastructure; inadequate, unspecific, fragmented and unequal funding support across health products as well as pro-substantial funding to basic research; lack of infrastructure, e.g. pilot plants, national compound library, genetic library, pilot plant including standard and qualified laboratory; the existing gap between researchers and private manufactur ers; and no participation of the private sector whatsoever in the process of R&D. Co mpared with other heal th products, R&D in vaccines has been more successful (see Section 4.2) ( Maleewong, Isulpisalkul, et al. 2011 ). Annex 5 summarizes some key indicators on the manufacturing capacity on three health products of interest in Thailand. Unfort unately, only little us eful information could be gathered. These figures are also spec ific to medical products for humans. Policy recommendation It was concluded that: (1) The national policy on R&D impacts health and therefore it is necessary to prioritize research on diseases which are the major burden for Thailand. However, this does not mean neglecting support for R&D on other diseases. (2) Accelerating the implementation of the existing polici es supporting R&D should be a priority. Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page 61 (3) The relatively successful model of rese arch on vaccines may be adopted for other health products, i.e. medicines, tr aditional medicines, medical supply equipment and machines. (4) There should be concerted cooperation among experts from different areas, particularly over R&D for pharmaceutical and traditional/herbal medicines. In addition to the scarcity of financial and human resources and infrastructure, other existing limitations of Thailand need to be addressed. Research in packages, and pooling and sharing of resources may be a solution and this requires professional coordination. (5) To maximize the benefits of TRIPS, the strategy could be to counterbalance the promotion of R&D by giving market excl usivity to innovators on the one hand and to expand this privilege to others through explicit information and innovation sharing and transfer on the other. (6) With regard to the limited capacity of Thailand and its focus on downstream R&D, intellectual property rights are an impediment which needs to be addressed in GSPA nationally and internationally. (7) Improving or setting up user-friendly information systems that support and update the situation on R&D while expl icitly indicating that intellectual property is a priority as well. This will facilitate R&D and as a result, time and resource utilization will be more efficient. (8) In sharing information across countries, WHO headquarters and the Regional Office should plan an active role in fa cilitating, coordinating and setting up a platform for discussion as well as in providing technical support. 9. Group discussion The representatives from Member States were briefed on the subject of group discussions that were scheduled to consider eight main Elements and 25 sub-Elements of the GSPA. The eight Elements, as indicated earlier, are: (1) prioritizing research and development needs; (2) promoting research and development; (3) building and improving innovative capacity; (4) transfer of technology; (5) application and management of intellectual property; (6) improving delivery and access; (7) ensuring sustainable financing mechanisms; (8) establishing monitoring and reporting systems. Report of a Regional Consultation Page 62 The representatives from Member States de veloped regional and national priorities on the basis of this Regional Consultation by covering all the eight Elements of GSPA vide resolution WHA 61.21. This exercise was based on the Templates A (Annex 7) and B mentioned earlier. 9.1 Eight Elements of GSPA The eight Elements were taken up for discussi on by four groups of participants. Each group discussed two elements of the GSPA as under: Groups I Element 1. Prioritizing rese arch and development needs. Element 2. Promoting research and development. Group II Element 3. Building and improving innovative capacity. Element 4. Transfer of Technology. Group III Element 5. Application and Management of Intellectual Property to contribute to innovation and promote public health. Group IV Element 6: Improving delivery and access. Element 7. Promoting Sustai nable Financing mechanisms. Element 8. Establishing monito ring and reporting systems. 9.2 Recommendations of SEA Region Member States on WHA 61.21, GSPA After the four groups identified the priorities , these were collated by them to develop the Regional and National Framework. Thus, ba sed on the output of the four groups, identification and prioritization for the Re gional and National Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Property under WHA 61.21 was done. Each Member State of the WHO South-East As ia Region stated its priority for each element of GSPA. The indication s were captured on a Likert32 scale from one to four 32 A Likert scale is a psychometric scale commonly involved in research that employs questionnaires. It is the most widely used approach to scaling responses in survey research, such that the term is often used interchangeably with rating scale . Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page 63 where one is of least priority and four is of maximum importance. This exercise includes the priorities for WHO and the Member countr y, the details of which are outlined in Annex 9. Certain Elements of GSPA ar e o f l i t t l e i m p o r t a n c e t o s o m e M e m b e r S t a t e s . F o r example, Annex 9 shows that certain Elements 1, 2 and 3 are of little importance to some countries such as Maldives and Bhutan. However, for Maldives, Element 7 - ensuring sustainable financing mechanisms - is very important, while for Bhutan Element 7.2 is least important and Element 7.1 is most importan t. Again, for Bhutan Element 8 is of less importance. For certain countries like India and Indonesia almost all Elements are rated as most important. The importance accorded for Element 7 is given separately in Annex 10. 33 For Bangladesh and Bhutan Element 7.2 is least important, while for India, Indonesia and Maldives both Element 7.1 and 7.2 are most important. For Thailand Element 6 - improving delivery and access - is less important, providing an indication of the relatively robust systems in place in the country. Thai land, however, rates Element 1 and 2 as most important. Based on these indicators, Reco mmendations for the Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Prop erty were arrived at during the Regional Consultation. 10. Recommendations The eight main Elements and 25 sub-Elements are seen as important parameters defining the future focus areas for public health, inno vation and intellectual property. The Member States identified priority ac tion points for WHO-SEARO and national priorities on GSPA, WHA 61.21. Specific actions for certain Memb er States were suggested and these have been given separately. Actions recommended for Member States (1) Institute a National Expert Committee for discussion on the GSPA and policy development on IPR and public health. Those Member States which already have some commission or panel in plac e need to include GSPA in the agenda for discussion. (2) Member countries should be assisted to develop capacity for negotiations in public health, innovation and IPR. (3) Member countries be assisted to develop an appropriate and suitable legal framework under IPT. (4) Member countries to ensure representation from the Health Ministry in trade negotiations. 33 In view of the work of the Consultati ve Expert Working Group under WHA 63.28 Report of a Regional Consultation Page 64 (5) Member countries must identify funding for R&D in neglected priority diseases. (6) Member countries should promote dome stic industries to enhance their capacity to conduct relevant R&D and m eet the needs of affordable medicines and medical technologies for public health. Actions recommended for WHO (1) In view of its importance in public he alth, the Regional Office to facilitate Member States to establish focal poin ts for public health, innovation and intelectual property rights. (2) Collect information on patents and other relevant databases and play an active role in enhancing understanding and facilitate the sharing of patent information and other relevant data bases related to public health. (3) Provide help in capacity-b uilding on intellectual pr operty and trade (IPT) to Member countries. (4) Develop mechanisms so that countries which have made substantial progress can share information and benefits with other countries and promote regional networking and capacity-building on p ublic health, innovation and IPT for Member States. (5) Provide technical assistance and financia l support to Member States for IPT in public health. (6) Build partnerships with other internat ional organizations to address IPT and public health with a focus on access to medicines and essential technologies. (7) Analyse IPT information for gaps in R&D for important diseases in the Region and analyse these gaps in the need fo r treatment of these diseases in the Region. (8) Seek new strategies for affordable medicines and for promoting downstream R&D and production of medicines as public goods. (9) Develop and seek new strategies and new financial resources for R&D. (10) Support and ensure that standards are maintained and requirements for the safety and quality of health products are fulfilled. (11) Assist Member States to prepare plans for regional technology platforms with a view to strengthen their capacities fo r delivery, manufacture and innovation using regional expertise. (12) Share information on IP filings and gran ts to maximize the freedom to operate (FTO) in the Region. Development of a Regional Framework on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Page 65 (13) Organize consultations of this kind to enhance the capabilities of Member States in IPT, innovations and public health, aspects that are crucial in the current globalized, trade-oriented international environment. Recommendations specific to Select Member States Certain recommendations emerge d from the Regional Consulta tion which were specific to certain Member States. These recommendations were delineated both by the participants from these countries as well as other delegates and deemed to be areas of focus and importance for these countries. Bangladesh Nominate a focal point to promote innovation and R&D for public health. This could be the drug administration author ities of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW). A committee could be formed exclusively for R&D activities. For this the Director-General of Drug Administration and Licensing Authority (Drugs) could be designated as the chairman with members from the MoHFW and the Ministry of Commerci al Industry along with co-opted members and legal officers. Interact with all stakeholders including WHO-SEARO and other UN agencies to implement GSPA. India Need to get into mission mode for the development of new drugs. Actively identify potential partners from other developing countries to promote R&D for new drugs. Establish a focal point for implementing GSPA involving relevant ministries and stakeholders in Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Indonesia Make a roadmap for making medical products to combat the following diseases: - Communicable diseases: vaccines, drugs or diagnostic kits. - Noncommunicable diseases: model of in tervention in the field including legislation. Facilitate South-South collaboration on R&D especially in the production of vaccines, drugs, including traditional medicines Facilitate collaboration with UN agenci es for innovation and capacity-building on R&D. Report of a Regional Consultation Page 66 Myanmar Prioritize R&D and include this in the National Health Plan (currently IPR is not yet included in the National Health Plan). Sri Lanka Establish a focal point with the Drug Regulatory Authority to interact with all stakehodlers including WHO-SEARO. Thailand Incorporate GSPA in the national plan for R&D and universal access to health products. Set up a national focal point for monitoring and evaluation.

Consider specific patent law issues that arise in relation to research in the life sciences field, such as the legal implications of patent pooling, patent exceptions applicable to medical research, 40 Type I diseases are incident in both rich and poor countries, with large numbers of vulnerable population in each. Examples of communicable diseases include measles, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae Type b, and examples of noncommunicable diseases abound (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascu lar diseases and tobacco-relat ed illnesses). Many vaccines for Type I diseases have been developed in the past 20 years but have not been widely introduced into the poor countries because of cost. Type II diseases are incident in both rich and poor countries, but with a substantial proportion of the cases in the poor countries. HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis are examples: both diseases are present in both rich and poor countries, but more than 90 per cent of cases are in the poor countries. Type III diseases are those that are overwhelmingly or exclusively inci dent in the developing countries, such as African sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis) and African river blindness (o nchocerciasis).

This report is the result of a detailed regional consultation held in New Delhi, India where participants from Member States identified how to address their priorities at the national, regional and international levels. It was also endeavoured to utilize certain facets of Intellectual Property as a development tool relevant to regional and national contexts in South-East Asia Region of WHO . Additionally , the supply of quality medical products is closely linked to the performance of the pharmaceutical industry which, in turn, is dependent on the economic policy framework set by governments. Presentations made in this regional consultation examined the status of this industry including traditional medicines, medical technologies and dental requirements while preparing a focused regional and country- specific national action plan.
