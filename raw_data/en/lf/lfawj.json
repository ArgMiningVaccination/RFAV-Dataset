The most traditional form of chiropractic care is a manual adjustment. This was established by the Palmer School of Chiropractic by founder D. D. Palmer. It involves using the hands to provide a chiropractic adjustment. Today this method continues to be used by chiropractors in Stafford, Virginia and with positive results. However, it can be difficult to perform more precise adjustments using this old school technique. What are the New and Modern Forms of Treatment? The use of mechanized instruments for chiropractic, in comparison to manual treatments, gives our chiropractor a better range of precision. We can get to the source of your musculoskeletal injury or pain more efficiently using these tools. For example, with the use of the modern advanced bio-structural correction technique, our Stafford chiropractor can find exact locations of misalignments. This saves you time and helps the chiropractor make more effective treatments. However, some people are more intimidated by the use of instruments and tools as part of modern chiropractic care. Which Type of Treatment is Best for Me? The good news is that all chiropractic treatments in use are safe and effective. However, depending on your pain relief or injury needs, you may prefer one method over another. In comparison to the manual therapy, which is effective for a general adjustment, our use of instruments can treat you with precision. For example, if you are suffering from neck pain or whiplash our modern use of the advanced bio-structural correction technique can provide you with an exact adjustment.
