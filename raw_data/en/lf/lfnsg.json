What is Coronavirus? Previously referred to as the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was recently discovered last December 2019 in Wuhan, China. On March 11, 2020, the WHO classified this disease as a pandemic or a \"worldwide spread of a new disease.\" As some might be familiar, the coronaviruses (CoV), a large group of viruses, have caused different well-known diseases, from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), and today's COVID-19. Coronaviruses are considered zoonotic or are transmitted from animals to humans. Most of the first COVID-19 cases, in particular, were linked to a wet market in Wuhan, which sold live animals. 1. Symptoms In some cases, the coronavirus is asymptomatic, which means that some people infected with it do not exhibit symptoms at all. However, most infected people experience mild flu-like symptoms. These symptoms may include: fever cough body aches runny nose fatigue sore throat diarrhea Read this article about the best essential oils for flu symptoms. Furthermore, this new strain of coronavirus takes 2 to 14 days or 5 days on average for infected individuals to present mild symptoms. It's also worth noting that people who are particularly susceptible to becoming severely sick with the virus are those with decreased immunity. These people include those over the age of 65 or people with serious preexisting medical conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, HIV, chronic lung disease, and chronic kidney disease. They also include those taking immunosuppressive medications. 2. Treatment Currently, there is no specific treatment for the coronavirus yet. Scientists, biologists, and biological technicians are still scrambling for a cure and trying to develop experimental antivirals and vaccines. People who are experiencing mild symptoms of coronavirus are recommended to stay at home and self-isolate for two weeks to prevent the spread of the disease. Those exhibiting high fever, shortness of breath, and lethargy should seek medical care right away. When treating coronavirus cases in hospitals, medical professionals care for patients by mitigating their symptoms. 3. Prevention While there's currently no cure for the coronavirus, experts strongly suggest that people should take preventive measures to protect themselves and others from the virus. Basically, these measures revolve around basic hygiene and limiting social interactions. To protect yourself from the virus, you should: Wash your hands regularly and thoroughly with soap and clean water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand rub to clean your hands if there's no sink or bathroom nearby. Avoid or stop touching your face altogether, particularly your mouth, eyes, and nose. Practice social distancing or keep a distance of at least 3 feet away from anyone who is sick. Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue or your inner elbow whenever you need to sneeze or cough. Stay home if you feel sick. Seek medical care and contact your doctor or local health authority if you have difficulty breathing, high body temperature, and cough.

Essential oils bring us a number of benefits, but you should never spray your blends\u2014even your [favorite antimicrobial oils](https://www.aromafoundry.com/products/antimicrobial-essential-oils) or antiviral essential oils\u2014in public, especially in enclosed spaces. Always keep in mind that other people might suffer from the strong scents of essential oils. Also, you have to respect and be considerate of people's personal spaces. You'll never know if one or more of those people are pregnant or have asthma, allergies, and other health conditions. By spraying essential oil blends in public spaces, you might be aggravating the health conditions of some. Remember that as with all other products and medicines, people have different reactions to essential oils. As the saying goes, \"Too much of anything is bad.\" This particularly applies to the use of essential oils. These oils are already potent in themselves. If you use too much essential oil, you might run the risk of getting adverse side effects. Even if the whole world's dealing with a serious pandemic, there's no cause for alarm and no need to use more essential oil than normal. Whether you're blending them or applying them to your skin, don't use too much oil, even if it's diluted. This has been mentioned before, but it bears repeating: essential oils do not serve as the main cure for COVID-19 and other serious health conditions. If you're experiencing any coronavirus symptoms, call your doctor right away and follow his or her instructions. The same goes for other serious health conditions. If you're suffering from one or if you're having a baby, it's still best to consult with your doctor before you try using essential oils as holistic remedies. As with all other kinds of medicine, you should practice caution when handling essential oils. Bottom Line There's still so much to discover about the benefits and uses of essential oils, especially when it comes to tackling serious viral infections. As of the moment, no scientific evidence exists to support the claim that essential oils can serve as remedies for the coronavirus. As the world is facing a frightening pandemic, the best thing each of us can do is to take care of ourselves by following the directives of local and global health authorities. Using essential oils is still considered safe, but these oils shouldn't be treated as primary remedies for any kind of health condition, including the coronavirus disease.
