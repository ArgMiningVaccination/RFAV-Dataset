Breakouts and clogged pores can show up anywhere, but when you notice them on your scalp, forehead, or the back of your neck, there's a chance it could be due to the ingredients in your shampoo. The best noncomedogenic shampoos are free from sulfates board-certified dermatologist [Dr. Alpana Mohta](https://bettergoods.org/dr-alpana-mohta/). Additionally, consider ingredients such as salicylic acid and tea tree oil to help \"control oil production, unclog pores, and reduce inflammation,\" Mohta tells Bustle, adding that, ideally, a noncomedogenic shampoo should also be pH-balanced, too. The Expert [Dr. Alpana Mohta](https://bettergoods.org/dr-alpana-mohta/) is a board-certified dermatologist and medical advisor for [Better Goods](http://bettergoods.org). She earned her Doctor of Medicine in Dermatology from Government Medical College in Kota, Rajasthan, and has since written over 60 research publications featured in various scientific journals. What To Consider When Shopping For A Noncomedogenic Shampoo Ingredients To Avoid Everyone reacts differently to ingredients, but to find shampoos that stand the best chance of not clogging your pores, [Dr. Mohta](https://bettergoods.org/dr-alpana-mohta/) says to look for ones that are free from \"sulfates, silicones, jojoba oil, cocoa butter, shea butter, and such as [mineral oil and paraffin wax](https://goop.com/beauty/makeup/whats-up-with-petroleum-in-beauty-products-7-days-of-goop-clean-beauty/). \"Sulfates are harsh cleansing agents that can strip the skin of its natural oils, which can lead to dryness and irritation,\" Dr. Mohta explains, and silicones tend to build up on the hair and scalp, causing clogged pores over time. Other ingredients to keep an eye out for include artificial fragrances and alcohol, which may cause irritation and dryness for some people, and essential oils that could worsen breakouts on acne-prone skin. Ingredients That Can Help The good news is that there are a few ingredients that can reduce breakouts and leave your scalp feeling fresh and clean. Salicylic acid \"can help to exfoliate the skin and unclog pores,\" says Dr. Mohta. Another ingredient to consider? Zinc pyrithione, for its \"antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties that can help to reduce the symptoms of acne.\" Scroll on for the best noncomedogenic shampoos available on Amazon to [free your pores from irritants](https://www.bustle.com/p/7-ingredients-to-avoid-if-you-have-sensitive-skin-68811) and acne-causing ingredients.
