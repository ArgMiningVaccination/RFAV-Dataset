Floral Baths Prior to each ceremony in the Amazon, we offer floral baths made from various jungle plants and flowers. Guests are invited to put their intention into the bath, asking the spirits of the plants to cleanse and protect them as they enter ceremony. meditation Studies have shown that meditation has similar effects on the brain as Ayahuasca, with over 100 different benefits to the mind, body, and spirit. By allowing ourselves to simply observe our thoughts, without judgement, and cultivating an ability to quiet our mind, we are improving our emotional well-being, focus, attention, energy levels & even our immune system. During meditation, beta waves are replaced by alpha waves, which are associated with brain coherence. The frontal lobes (reasoning, planning & processing information) slow down. The nervous system can rest, resulting in improvedrelaxation & body functioning. Pranayama The ancient Indian system of yoga identified 'prana' as the universal life force or energy that flows through us, via thousands of subtle energy channels called 'nadis' and energy centers called 'chakras.' 'Ayama' means to regulate or lengthen. Pranayamas, therefore, are yogic breathing exercises that nurture this life force, bringing harmony between the body, mind and spirit, making one physically, mentally and spiritually strong. These practices have the ability to quickly release stress, boost the immune system, improve our mental clarity, increase vitality (prana), and calm the mind. sound baths Surrender to an audial landscape as we bathe you with meditative instrumentation, including Tibetan singing bowls, shamanic drumming, Native American flute, and chimes.
