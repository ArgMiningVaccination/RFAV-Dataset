We will talk with you in a supportive and inquiring manner, rather than impose a perspective on you. We are always available for urgent needs. Your nurse, social worker or another care team member can connect you with us. Chaplaincy care (spiritual, religious, emotional, existential care) is available at any stage of your treatment process for patients treated at the South Lake Union Clinic, community sites, and University of Washington Medical Center. We are committed to responding to every referral in a timely manner and making follow-up visits with patients and family members on a regular basis. Because we are unable to visit every Fred Hutch patient, we rely upon patients, families, friends, and faith communities to let us know about someone who would benefit from our visit. Illness can be a painful, frightening, and isolating experience full of uncertainties and loss. Sometimes illness can push one to the point of experiencing spiritual and emotional chaos, pain and distress. But it can also be an opportunity to celebrate, change and experience expressions of being cared for in new ways. In addition to the resources our Spiritual Health staff have to offer patients and their families, there is also a Sanctuary available to all at the South Lake Union clinic. The Sanctuary is open for quiet time, prayer, meditation and reflection that can be vital to well-being and wholeness. It is located on the third floor of our South Lake Union Clinic. As a refuge for those who are hurting, the Sanctuary is a place of retreat while actions are being taken to help bring healing. People of all faiths and spiritualities are welcome. As a sacred space, the Sanctuary is a place where patients, families, and staff can feel more connected to themselves, their traditions, or the source of their spirituality. A Book of Prayers is located on the round common table where you can write prayers or prayer requests, knowing that others will read what is written and join you in prayer. You may take a blessing from a blessing bowl in the Sanctuary. Different blessings are written on small colorful pieces of paper. Varied spiritual resources are available for use by patients, families, and staff. These include sacred texts from diverse faith traditions, CareNotes, a prayer rug, a meditation pillow, Shabbat candles, Bibles, and other resources. There are no regular worship and meditations services in the Sanctuary. There are labyrinth walks on the first and third Monday afternoons in the first floor conference room of the South Lake Union clinic. Occasional services are held in the Sanctuary. Responding to the questions in this self-assessment can be helpful as a private exercise or an exploration with others as you reflect on your life and your beliefs. We want to be respectful of you. As you use this tool, you may want to substitute different terms more suitable to your tradition and beliefs. If you would like to explore with someone else, you are invited to contact Spiritual Health. You can reach us at [206.606.1099](tel:206-606-1099) or [spiritualhealth@fredhutch.org](mailto:spiritualhealth@fredhutch.org). Spiritual Health is staffed with board-certified chaplains. This means that we are accountable to the institution, to a national certifying body, and to a particular faith tradition. Minimal requirements are a professional master's degree in theological studies, one year of full-time clinical education in a health care setting, and endorsement by a faith group. We follow a code of ethics that requires respectful care for all people. "}
