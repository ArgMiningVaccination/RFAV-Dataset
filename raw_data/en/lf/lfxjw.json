Introduction [1](#B1-sustainability-13-10587), [2](#B2-sustainability-13-10587)]. Works using IAMs have been recognized with two Nobel Prizes, awarded to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2007 and William Nordhaus in 2018, respectively. Extant modeling work has integrated economic, technological, and biophysical processes that produce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but political science\u2014despite its high relevance\u2014has mostly been left out of the picture. This is not entirely surprising because political phenomena can be very challenging to model. [3](#B3-sustainability-13-10587)]. The annual total cost of violence is estimated to be USD 9.4 trillion, which is equivalent to 11 percent of the world's GDP [ [4](#B4-sustainability-13-10587), [5](#B5-sustainability-13-10587), [6](#B6-sustainability-13-10587)]. While violence has shaped social and economic development tremendously across human history, most extant economic models have failed to take violence into account, and the impact of security on prosperity remains mostly understudied [ [3](#B3-sustainability-13-10587)] (It is important to differentiate between \"carbon price\" and \"optimal carbon price.\" A carbon price is a cost imposed on carbon emissions to discourage polluters from emitting, which usually takes the form of a carbon tax or a requirement to purchase emissions permits. The optimal carbon price is the carbon price at which the net social benefit of carbon emissions would be maximized). Some recently published econometric studies are paving the way, and this study showcases how a critical political concept\u2014human security\u2014can and must be integrated into policy-relevant climate modeling. [7](#B7-sustainability-13-10587), [8](#B8-sustainability-13-10587), [9](#B9-sustainability-13-10587), [10](#B10-sustainability-13-10587)]. Increasing temperatures can also indirectly contribute to more violence by decreasing agricultural production, industrial outputs, and political stability [ [11](#B11-sustainability-13-10587)]. After surveying 60 of the most rigorous quantitative studies of the relationship between temperature change and the incidence of violence, Hsiang, Burke, and Miguel identify strong evidence that climatic events change the frequency or intensity of human violence across substantial spatial and temporal scales [ [12](#B12-sustainability-13-10587)]. [13](#B13-sustainability-13-10587)]. Deploying recent econometric findings on the costs of different types of violence for different global regions, this paper finds that internalizing the damages from climate-induced violence can roughly double the carbon externality that is priced by the model, and this relationship holds across time and different specifications regarding climate sensitivity, GDP growth rate, and the catastrophic temperature. This relationship can be sensitive when (1) the willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid nonmarket damages (e.g., damages related to mortality, health, quality of life) is low, (2) the nonmarket damages are excluded, or (3) the magnitude of climate-violence damage is at a high boundary of the uncertainty range in empirical studies. Under the assumption that the WTP to avoid nonmarket damages equates to 1 percent of regional income, the avoided damages from climate-induced violence in sub-Saharan Africa is modeled to reach about 0.5 percent of the region's GDP in 2050, 2 percent in 2100, and almost 4 percent in 2200. When the magnitude of climate damage reaches the high-end, the avoided damages from climate-induced violence in sub-Saharan Africa are projected to reach close to 2 percent in 2050, 10 percent in 2100, and 30 percent in 2200 in terms of the region's GDP. This exercise shows that socially contingent damages, such as human violence, can and must be integrated into policy-relevant climate models. Thus, there is vast space for political scientists to integrate their insights and make significant contributions to the climate modeling enterprise. [Section 2](#sec2-sustainability-13-10587)provides an overview of the existing literature on the externality of climate-induced violence and the motivation behind this modeling exercise. [Section 3](#sec3-sustainability-13-10587)describes the methods and procedures. [Section 4](#sec4-sustainability-13-10587)presents modeling results from scenarios under different assumptions. [Section 5](#sec5-sustainability-13-10587)concludes with policy implications and future research directions. 2. The Externality of Climate-Induced Violence [14](#B14-sustainability-13-10587)], including violent crimes [ [15](#B15-sustainability-13-10587)] and domestic violence [ [16](#B16-sustainability-13-10587)]. On a collective or intergroup level, empirical evidence points to an active link between climate change and conflicts in both sub-Saharan Africa [ [17](#B17-sustainability-13-10587), [18](#B18-sustainability-13-10587), [19](#B19-sustainability-13-10587), [20](#B20-sustainability-13-10587), [21](#B21-sustainability-13-10587)] and elsewhere [ [22](#B22-sustainability-13-10587)]. The causal mechanisms behind the effects of weather shocks on conflicts are sundry: crop yields [ [20](#B20-sustainability-13-10587)], economic growth [ [17](#B17-sustainability-13-10587)], government revenue [ [23](#B23-sustainability-13-10587)], and migration [ [24](#B24-sustainability-13-10587)]. [25](#B25-sustainability-13-10587)]. [26](#B26-sustainability-13-10587)]. To the author's knowledge, there is only one study that considers one of the many forms of climate change-induced violence\u2014violent crime\u2014in the damage function, but the other types of climate-induced violence damages remain unaccounted [ [27](#B27-sustainability-13-10587)] (Another study that is broadly related to the climate-conflict relationship focuses instead on a positive sociopolitical feedback loop [ [28](#B28-sustainability-13-10587)]. Using the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE) model, it illustrates that climate-induced violence makes it harder to sign environmental treaties, including global climate treaties, which, in turn, jeopardizes climate change mitigation further. However, the study does not explicitly model the costs of violence, but it provides further evidence that the estimates of carbon externality reached in this paper are lower bounds). [12](#B12-sustainability-13-10587), [29](#B29-sustainability-13-10587)]. In the meantime, some question the criteria for case inclusion and the appropriateness of meta-analysis as a method to quantify climate-induced violence in these studies [ [30](#B30-sustainability-13-10587)]. The debate continued in subsequent papers [ [31](#B31-sustainability-13-10587), [32](#B32-sustainability-13-10587)]. 3. Methods 3.1. Definition and Data [33](#B33-sustainability-13-10587)]. The WHO records deadly violence in three general categories: self-directed violence, collective violence, and interpersonal violence. Here, the latter two types of violence are in focus, which correspond with the data on the costs of violence published in recent years by James Fearon and Anke Hoeffler [ [4](#B4-sustainability-13-10587), [5](#B5-sustainability-13-10587), [6](#B6-sustainability-13-10587)]. Collective violence refers to violence perpetrated by organized groups, such as states, rebel organizations, terrorists, street mobs, or criminal organizations. Interpersonal violence refers to violence committed by an individual, which, depending on the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, can be further broken down into intimate partner violence and child abuse. [6](#B6-sustainability-13-10587)], who relied on unit cost estimates for various types of violence (e.g., homicides, assaults, and rapes) in the United States by McCollister et al. [ [34](#B34-sustainability-13-10587)] to estimate the cost of violence for the year 2013. Hoeffler extended the cost estimations to other countries by multiplying the US cost of homicide by the ratio of a country's GDP to US GDP and then used data on violent events by global region to develop regional cost estimates of violence. There are assumptions associated with both the approach taken by Hoeffler and that by McCollister et al. McCollister et al. combined several approaches to pricing crimes, such as the cost of illness, contingent valuation, and jury compensation methods, and all of these approaches assume that the impacts of crimes are fully understood (The cost of illness approach tries to quantify the tangible costs of crime on outcomes of interest based on the best available information, which usually comes from self-reports from the victims and assigned prices. Similarly, the jury award approach seeks to assess the total social cost of crime by employing actual compensation from civil personal injury cases. Contingent valuation involves surveys to gauge respondents' willingness to pay to avoid different crimes, which, in theory, should provide a measure of both tangible and intangible costs). Hoeffler's approach also comes with nontrivial assumptions. First, applying social costs of homicide to calculate the costs of deaths from collective violence equates two drastically different types of death, which generate different social losses. Second, using the ratio of GDPs to map US-based estimates into other countries, especially non-high-income countries, ignores fundamental differences across geographies such as life expectancy, which would affect the social loss of homicidal and non-homicidal offenses. Violence is often of greater concern to and considered \"worse\" for richer countries than lower-income ones. [35](#B35-sustainability-13-10587), [36](#B36-sustainability-13-10587)]. Specifically, IAMs often require transferring estimates from developed countries with greater data availability to developing countries with less availability of data. [34](#B34-sustainability-13-10587)], which estimates most tangible and intangible losses, excludes such costs as psychological injury and additional costs associated with sexual violence (e.g., sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy, suicide, and substance abuse) [ [34](#B34-sustainability-13-10587)]. This exclusion is transported into Hoeffler's estimates. Furthermore, in Hoeffler's calculation, self-directed violence costs are excluded and so are some relevant costs in cases where data is unavailable. These include the cost of war injuries, widespread destruction of infrastructure in a war, and economic and security concerns resulting from war, in addition to the costs of nonfatal domestic violence against women and children, violence perpetrated by women against their male partners, and violence amongst homosexual couples. In addition to the missing items specified by Hoeffler, scholarly classics in the social sciences enlighten us that one critical example of valuing the invaluable or pricing the priceless involves measuring the decline or loss of social capital. First put forth by Alexis de Tocqueville, the concept of social capital was developed further by Robert Putnam [ [37](#B37-sustainability-13-10587), [38](#B38-sustainability-13-10587)]. Social capital refers to \"features of social organization such as networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit\" [ [38](#B38-sustainability-13-10587)]. The benefit of social capital is complicated to quantify because measures such as the number and membership size of associations cannot precisely fathom the frequency and quality of association. Violence provides a negative drag on social capital. Hence, any empirical attempt to quantify the costs of violence will lack most intangible costs, and existing estimates are best understood as appropriate underestimates. [Table 1](#sustainability-13-10587-t001). (It is plausible that war deaths entail both nonmarket and market losses. Losses from deaths from war are grouped into nonmarket damages to stay consistent with Hoeffler's method of using intangible costs. Hoeffler calculated the costs of the lives lost in civil wars by \"multiplying the number of fatalities by the cost of homicide,\" whose \"intangible cost...is assumed to be $8.44 million, and this value is inflated to 2013 prices and scaled by the relative GDP ratio to approximate the cost of homicide across different countries\" [ [34](#B34-sustainability-13-10587)]). 3.2. The Relationship between Climate Change and the Incidence of Violence [12](#B12-sustainability-13-10587)]. They identify that the median effect of a one-standard-deviation increase from normal temperature (i.e., 0.5 \u00b0C) induces a 14 percent rise in the frequency of intergroup conflict and a 4 percent increase in the incidence of interpersonal violence globally (While the median effect on intergroup conflict is higher than that on interpersonal violence, the base number of incidents of interpersonal violence is substantially higher; in other words, a small percentage rise can entail a massive increase in total incidents). Based on these figures, the rate of the incidence of climate-induced violence at time , can be expressed as a function of temperature increase at time from the pre-industrial level, , and as a multiple of the rate of climate-induced violence in the pre-industrial period (In the version of MERGE used in this paper, does not include annual variability. This is an area where future research can improve). Suppose that the rate for the pre-industrial period is \"1,\" the median rate of intergroup violence, and the median rate of interpersonal violence, can be expressed as the following (While some studies identify climate change to have an approximately linear effect on conflicts [ [39](#B39-sustainability-13-10587)], Hsiang, Burke, and Miguel elaborate that reported linear relationships should be interpreted as local linearizations of a global relationship that is nonlinear and possibly curved [ [12](#B12-sustainability-13-10587)]. Future extensions of this study can evaluate carbon externality under the assumption of a linear climate-conflict relationship): [Section 4.6](#sec4dot6-sustainability-13-10587). 3.3. Internalization of the Costs of Climate-Induced Violence into the Damage Function of the IAM [40](#B40-sustainability-13-10587)], which modified the original version [ [41](#B41-sustainability-13-10587)] by incorporating more features, refining the global regions, and updating some data. More details on the EMF 27 MERGE model can be found in the online appendix of Blanford et al. (2014) [ [40](#B40-sustainability-13-10587)]. The EMF 27 global regions include Canada-Australia-New Zealand (Other OECD), China, the Greater European Union, Group 3, India, Japan, the Rest of Asia, the Rest of the World, and the United States (The global regions in the original MERGE model are the USA, other OECD countries (Western Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand), FSU (the former USSR), China, and the ROW (rest of the world) [ [41](#B41-sustainability-13-10587)]). Canada-Australia-New Zealand, the Greater European Union, Japan, and the United States are high-income and thus are assigned costs of violence values based on Hoeffler's estimates for the \"High Income\" region. The climate damages already represented in the model do not include those from violence, so it does not appear necessary to remove any portion of the damage functions for this paper [ [41](#B41-sustainability-13-10587)]. [42](#B42-sustainability-13-10587)], and is calculated as follows: [12](#B12-sustainability-13-10587)] and the costs of collective and interpersonal violence as fractions of GDP for different regions of the world [ [6](#B6-sustainability-13-10587)]. For given region , the and can be expressed based on Equations (1) and (2) as: 3.4. Avoided Damage from Internalization 4. Updating the Carbon Externality and Its Effects under Different Scenarios 4.1. Reference Scenario [Figure 1](#sustainability-13-10587-f001)suggests that internalization consistently raises the optimal carbon price to 1.8 times (i.e., a near doubling) during the 2020-2200 period. [Figure 2](#sustainability-13-10587-f002)). Based on Equations (1) and (2), the trajectories for temperature give rise to the projected trends for the rates of collective and interpersonal violence, represented as multiples of that in the pre-industrial period (i.e., the pre-industrial rate is \"1\"). [Figure 3](#sustainability-13-10587-f003)). The most prominent beneficiary is sub-Saharan Africa, which is projected to avert 0.09 percent of GDP loss from climate-induced violence in 2050 when the model assesses outputs after internalizing the costs of climate-induced violence. This figure of averted loss is about 14 percent of the region's current incurred costs from collective violence, estimated by Hoeffler, to be at 0.63 percent of the regional GDP [ [6](#B6-sustainability-13-10587)]. Sub-Saharan Africa is followed by the Middle East and North Africa, India, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and China. High-income countries, while the lowest on the list, are estimated to be still able to avoid 0.01 percent of GDP worth of loss from climate-induced violence in 2050 with the new carbon pricing in place. 4.2. Sensitivity Analysis: Climate Sensitivity [43](#B43-sustainability-13-10587)]). The upper- and lower-bound values of climate sensitivity also explored are 1.5 \u00b0C and 6 \u00b0C. As shown in [Figure 4](#sustainability-13-10587-f004), the relationship of a near doubling of the optimal carbon price due to the internalization of climate-induced violence costs holds across time in all three scenarios. [Figure 5](#sustainability-13-10587-f005)). With higher climate sensitivity, the projected rates of climate-induced violence during each time period are consistently higher. Under which assumption about climate sensitivity does endogenizing the costs of climate-induced violence yield the most reduced rates of violence? It depends on the time horizon. The rates for collective and interpersonal violence are most reduced at 0.03 and 0.01 in 2050 when the climate sensitivity is low, 0.08 and 0.02 in 2100 when the climate sensitivity is at default, and 0.54 and 0.07 in 2200 when the climate sensitivity is high. [Figure 6](#sustainability-13-10587-f006)suggests that in the long run, the higher the climate sensitivity, the higher the avoided damages from climate-induced violence as a percentage of regional GDP. When the climate sensitivity equals 1.5 \u00b0C, sub-Saharan Africa is projected to prevent 0.24 percent of GDP loss due to climate-induced violence in 2050. Under the assumption of a highly sensitive climate (6 \u00b0C), the percentage for Africa is estimated to reach 0.05 percent in 2050. At the other end of the spectrum, the avoided damages from climate-induced violence will be worth 0.04 percent of GDP when the climate is the least sensitive and 0.01 percent of GDP when the climate is the most sensitive in high-income countries. 4.3. Sensitivity Analysis: GDP Growth Rate [Figure 7](#sustainability-13-10587-f007)shows that accounting for climate-induced violence costs nearly doubles the pricing of carbon externalities, a relationship that remains robust across time and growth rate scenarios. [Figure 8](#sustainability-13-10587-f008)). When the GDP growth rate is at default or is incremented by 1 percent, the rate of collective violence is reduced by 0.01 in the Violence scenario vis-\u00e0-vis the BAU scenario in 2050. [Figure 9](#sustainability-13-10587-f009)). It is also worth noting that when the GDP growth rate is incremented by 2 percent, the avoided costs are negative in 2020, 2030, and 2040. That means that during those time periods internalizing climate-induced violence in generating the optimal carbon price would cause more damages from climate-induced violence. Nevertheless, the payoffs become evident in the longer run. 4.4. Sensitivity Analysis: WTP for Nonmarket Damages [42](#B42-sustainability-13-10587)]. Changing the WTP, which is in itself uncertain, for nonmarket damages can influence how much nonmarket damages are factored into the calculation of optimal carbon prices. Furthermore, the default WTP is 4 percent in MERGE, meaning that residents of all regions are willing to devote 4 percent of their regional income to avoid nonmarket climate damages associated with 2 \u00b0C of warming. Since the figure could be lower in less-developed regions of the world, I change the WTP to avoid nonmarket damages to 1 percent and 2 percent for the sensitivity analysis. [Figure 10](#sustainability-13-10587-f010), incorporating the costs of climate-induced violence raises the projection of optimal carbon prices to about twice as much as before under the 2 percent of regional GDP assumption and a bit above three times as much under the 1 percent assumption. Hence, changes in pricing the carbon externality in the Violence scenario vis-\u00e0-vis BAU could be sensitive to the assumption about WTP to avoid nonmarket damages. [Figure 11](#sustainability-13-10587-f011)). Under a WTP of 1 percent of regional income, the projected temperature increases are estimated to be 1.89 \u00b0C and 1.76 \u00b0C in 2050, and the rates of collective and interpersonal violence are projected to reduce by 0.06 and 0.01, respectively, in the Violence scenario vis-\u00e0-vis the BAU scenario. [Figure 12](#sustainability-13-10587-f012)). This pattern is intuitive because as people care less about climate damages from sources other than climate-induced violence, climate-induced violence matters relatively more to people. At a WTP of 1 percent of regional income, which is perhaps the closest to reality based on existing empirical works, the avoided damages from climate-induced violence in sub-Saharan Africa are estimated to reach 0.46 percent of the region's GDP in 2050. 4.5. Sensitivity Analysis: Inclusion/Exclusion of Nonmarket Damages [Figure 13](#sustainability-13-10587-f013)). 4.6. Accounting for The Magnitude of the Climate-Violence Response Relationship [Section 3.2](#sec3dot2-sustainability-13-10587), this paper seeks to factor in the uncertainty surrounding the estimates in Hsiang et al. (2013). Specifically, this paper reassesses the results by replacing the median estimates of the increase in the incidence of climate-induced violence with high- and low-bound estimates. The calculations refer to the Supplementary Tables S2 and S3 in Hsiang et al. (2013), which provide their original estimated effects from each study on interpersonal violence and intergroup violence, respectively. For estimates on interpersonal violence, calculations take the second-highest (16) and the second-lowest (2), among 11, estimates. For estimates on intergroup conflict, calculations take the fourth-highest (42) and the fourth-lowest (6), among 21, estimates. The original Equations (1) and (2) are updated to (12) and (13), respectively, for high-bound estimates of the incidences of climate-induced violence and expressed as follows: [Figure 16](#sustainability-13-10587-f016), when the damage magnitude is low-bound, the Violence scenario yields optimal carbon prices nearly twice the size of those in the BAU scenario. Having a high-bound damage magnitude raises the optimal carbon prices to between six and eight times those in the BAU scenario, suggesting that the main finding is sensitive to the value of the high-bound damage magnitude. [Figure 17](#sustainability-13-10587-f017)). As a result, such a scenario is also projected to have the highest avoided damages from climate-induced violence as percentages of regional GDP ( [Figure 18](#sustainability-13-10587-f018)). Of particular note, sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to avoid damages related to climate-induced violence that is worth 1 percent of the regional GDP in 2050, 9 percent in 2100, and 27 percent in 2200. 4.7. Sensitivity Analysis: Catastrophic Temperature [42](#B42-sustainability-13-10587)]. Here, is a catastrophic temperature parameter chosen in such a way that the entire regional product is wiped out; in other words, it represents the catastrophic temperature at which the WTP at infinite income reaches 100 percent. Its default value in MERGE is 10 \u00b0C. In addition, , the hockey-stick parameter that represents the degree of loss due to temperature increase. A default value of 1 assumes that the loss is quadratic in terms of the temperature rise, and this value is assumed for high-income countries and is highly speculative [ [42](#B42-sustainability-13-10587)]. If the amount of loss as a result of one unit of temperature rise is less than the quadratic, the value of should be less than 1, and the value for should be lower than the default. After a new value for is set at 8.5 \u00b0C, leaving all other parameters unchanged, the analysis is re-executed. [Figure 19](#sustainability-13-10587-f019)). The near doubling of the optimal carbon prices in the Violence scenario vis-\u00e0-vis the BAU scenario persists between 2020 and 2180 when . After 2180, the default scenario, where the catastrophic temperature is assumed to be higher, the ratio of the optimal carbon prices is projected to decline in the scenario. [Figure 20](#sustainability-13-10587-f020)and [Figure 21](#sustainability-13-10587-f021)). Changing the assumption about the catastrophic temperature does not seem to affect the projections until 2170, with a horizon towards 2200. After 2170, the default scenario yields lower projected temperate and rates of violence and higher avoided damages as percentages of regional GDP thanks to higher optimal carbon prices. 5. Conclusions and Policy Implications [6](#B6-sustainability-13-10587)] and the median estimates of the incidence of violence per one standard deviation change in temperature [ [12](#B12-sustainability-13-10587)], this study derives the costs of climate-induced violence. By internalizing such costs in MERGE, which is a methodological contribution of the paper, the results indicate that the optimal carbon price roughly doubles across a range of scenarios with different assumptions regarding climate sensitivity, GDP growth rate, and the catastrophic temperature. This relationship can be sensitive when the WTP to avoid nonmarket damages is low, when nonmarket damages are excluded, or when the climate-violence damage magnitude is at a high-bound of the uncertainty range represented in Hsiang et al.'s estimates. [12](#B12-sustainability-13-10587)]. To mitigate these biases, future research can utilize improved estimates of the costs of violence, which would be based on the country-level estimate of the value of a statistical life (VSL), projected country-level weather trends, and country- or region-level climate-violence relationships, when such estimates become available. (Furthermore, since Hsiang, Burke, and Miguel (2013) provide one approximation of the \"true\" functional form of the relationship between climate change and conflict, future research can utilize other functional forms in the modeling exercise (e.g., linear). Moreover, researchers can conduct similar analyses using other IAMs and perform inter-model comparisons of results. Last but not least, future research can try to factor in the effects of projected adaption).
