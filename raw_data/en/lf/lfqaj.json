Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by Jo hn Wiley & Sons, Ltd. A B S T R A C T Background Viral infections cause signicant morbidity and mortality in p atients with hematological malignancies. It remains uncertai n whether viral vaccinations in these patients are supported by good evi dence. Objectives We aimed to determine the effectiveness and safety of viral va ccines in patients with hematological malignancies. Search methods We searched Cochrane Central T rials (CE NTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL (June 2010), reference lists of relevant papers, abstracts from scientic meetings a nd contacted vaccine manufacturers. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating viral vaccines in patients with hematological malignancies were included. Data collection and analysis Relative risk (RR) was used for binary data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data. Primary outcome was incidence of infecti on. Secondary outcomes were mortality, incidence of complications an d severe viral infection, hospitalization, immune response and adverse effects. Fixed-effect model was used in meta-analyses. Main results Eight RCTs were included, with 305 patients in the interventi on groups and 288 in the control groups. They evaluated heat-in activated varicella zoster virus (VZV) vaccine (two trials), influenza vaccin es (ve trials) and inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) (one tria l). Seven trials had high and one trial had moderate risk of bias. VZV vaccine might reduce herpes zoster compared to no vaccine (RR 0.5 4, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.0, P=0.05), but not statistically signicant. Vaccination also demonstrated efcacy in immune response but fr equently caused local adverse effects. One trial reported seve rity score of zoster, which favored vaccination (MD 2.6, 95% CI 0.94 to 4.26, P=0.002). 1 Vaccines for prophylaxis of viral infections in patients wi th hematological malignancies (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.T wo RCTs compared inactivated influenza vaccine with no vaccine and reported lower risk of lower respiratory infections (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.78, P=0.008) and hospitalization (RR 0.17, 95 % CI 0.09 to 0.31, P<0.00001) in vaccine recipients. However, vaccine recipients more frequently experienced irritability a nd local adverse effects. There was no signicant difference in s eroconversion between one and two doses of influenza vaccine (one trial), or betw een recombinant and standard influenza vaccine (one trial), or influenza vaccine given with or without re-induction chemotherap y (one trial). The IPV trial comparing vaccination starting at 6 versus 18 mont hs after stem cell transplant (SCT) found no signicant differe nce in seroconversion. Authors' conclusions VZV vaccine reduce zoster severity in adult SC T recipients. Inactivated influenza vaccine might reduce respira tory infections and hospitalization in adults with multiple myel oma or children with leukemia or lymphoma. However, the quali ty of evidence is low. Local adverse effects occur frequently. Further high-quality RCTs are needed. P L A I N L A N G U A G E S U M M A R Y Varicella and influenza vaccines may reduce morbidity in pat ients with blood cancers Viral infections cause signicant disease and even death in pat ients with blood cancers. In the current systematic review of ra ndomized controlled trials (RCTs) we aimed to evaluate the efcacy and saf ety of viral vaccines in these patients. The pre-dened primary outcome was incidence of the infection concerned. Secondary outcomes were m ortality due to the viral infection, all-cause mortality, incid ence of complications, incidence of severe viral infection, hospitaliz ation rate, in vitro immune response and frequency of adverse effects. Eight RCTs were included. They evaluated heat-inactivated varicella zoster virus (VZV) vaccine (two trials), influenza vaccines (ve tri als) and inactivated poliovirus vaccine (one trial). There were no RCTs on other viral vaccines (hepatitis A, hepatitis B, measles, mumps , rubella). Only the two trials on VZV vaccine reported our pre-dened prima ry outcome. All trials reported some of the pre-dened secondar y outcomes. We found that inactivated VZV vaccine might reduce the s everity of herpes zoster when given before and after stem cell transplant in adults with lymphoma or leukemia. Inactivated influenza vaccine might reduce upper and lower respiratory infe ctions and hospitalization in adults with multiple myeloma who are und ergoing chemotherapy, or children with leukemia or lymphoma w ithin two years post-chemotherapy. However, the quality of evidence is not high. Local adverse effects occur frequently with the vaccin es, although serious adverse effects appear uncommon. Further hi gh-quality RCTs are needed to clarify the benets and optimal r egimens of viral vaccines for patients with blood cancers. B A C K G R O U N D Description of the condition Viral infections are important causes of morbidity or even mor tal- ity in patients with hematological malignancies who are immun o- compromised. In addition, viral infections may delay chemothe r- apy and necessitate hospitalization and antibiotic adminis tration (Feldman 1977 ;Elting 1995 ;Yousuf 1997 ). Description of the intervention Some viral infections can be prevented by vaccinations, such as influenza, varicella and herpes zoster. However, the practice o fviral vaccination in patients with hematological malignancies is highly variable among different treatment centres. It is gen erally held that patients with hematological malignancies have alte red immune function, either as a result of the underlying hematol ogi- cal malignancy or treatment with chemotherapy; and vaccination in these patients might be ineffective. In addition, there is often a concern that vaccination in patients with hematological malig- nancies might be associated with more adverse effects ( Henning 1997 ;Irish 1998 ;Booth 2000 ), especially in the case of live-at- tenuated vaccines. American and British guidelines recommend annual vaccination against influenza for adults and children who are immunosup- pressed because of disease or treatment ( DOH 1996 ;ACIP 2005 ). However, there is no clear-cut recommendation as to whether and 2 Vaccines for prophylaxis of viral infections in patients wi th hematological malignancies (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.when patients with hematological malignancies should receive in- fluenza vaccination. A recent study indicated that one-third of pediatric oncologists and hematologists did not routinely r ecom- mend yearly influenza vaccination for children with cancer ( Porter 2003 ). As modern influenza vaccines contain hemagglutinin and neu- raminidase surface antigens obtained from chemically inactiva ted influenza virus strains, there is no risk of introducing active in- fection in immunocompromised individuals. Many studies have documented seroconversion in patients with hematological ma- lignancies on chemotherapy 1996 1997 1998 1999 ; Robertson 2000 ;Chisholm 2001 ;Hsieh 2002 ;Nordoy 2002 ; Rapezzi 2003 ;Porter 2004 ;Brydak 2006 ) but other studies did not reveal sufcient immune response in patients with cancer (Borella 1971 ;Allison 1977 ;Gross 1978 ;Stiver 2001 2005 ;Mazza 2005 ). Although the rate of seroconversion is generally lower than in healthy adult volu nteers, the use of multiple doses of influenza vaccine may increase the antibody response ( Feery 1977 ;Gribabis 1994 ). Influenza vacci- nation is generally safe, with only mild adverse effects, as f ound in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or multiple myelo ma (Gribabis 1994 ;Rapezzi 2003 ). Many case series have documented seroconversion in large propo r- tions of 1996 ;Navajas 1999 2004 ) mostly after chemotherapy or during main- tenance chemotherapy. Protective efcacy may last for at least a few years ( T origoe 1981 ;Oka 1984 ;Gershon 1989 ). In addition, leukemic patients who receive the live-attenuated varicella v ac- cine might have lower incidence of zoster than patients who have natural varicella infections ( Hardy 1991 ;LaRussa 1996 ;Navajas 1999 ). Inactivated varicella vaccines might also reduce the risk of zoster in recipients of an hematopoietic stem cell transplant (Hata 2002 ). Adverse effects of varicella vaccine are usually mild but vari- cella or herpes zoster caused by the vaccine virus occur (Ninane 1985 ;Christensen 1999 ). Measles, vaccines are l ive- attenuated vaccines given routinely in early childhood in many countries. However, loss of antibodies has been demonstrate d in patients with hematological malignancies ( Bosu ;Zignol 2004 ). Re-vaccination has been an important consideration in this grou p of patients but the safety and efcacy of re-vaccination in these p a- tients are not certain Mitus origoe1981 These vaccines are sidered to be contraindicated in patients receiving chemothera py because of risks of infection with the vaccine strains. Neverthe - less, a study found that when measles vaccine was given three to six months after chemotherapy in leukemic patients, the pati ents might still develop protective antibodies though the seropo sitivity rate was lower than in healthy controls ( Ercan 2005 ). A study demonstrated that 85% of leukemic patients who receiv ed hepatitis B vaccine after chemotherapy developed protective an - tibodies ( Fioredda 2005 ); and one-third of the leukemic children undergoing maintenance chemotherapy responded to the vaccine (Yetgin 2001 ). However, during intensive chemotherapy the sero- logical response was reported to be very low ( Moryl 2004 ); passive immunization in the aggressive phase followed by active immu - nization after cessation of intense chemotherapy might increa se the rates of protective antibody levels ( Somjee 2002 ). Why it is important to do this review Although available viral vaccines are shown to be effective in healthy children for prevention of the respective viral infect ions, it is uncertain whether existing evidence is rigorous enough t o show that the vaccines are also effective and safe in patients wi th hematological malignancies. These patients are immunocompro - mised as a result of their diseases or the treatments. Theref ore we examined the efcacy and safety of viral vaccines in patients wit h hematological malignancies in a systematic review of randomi zed controlled trials. O B J E C T I V E S The objectives of this systematic review were to determine th e ef- fectiveness and safety of viral vaccines in patients with hemat olog- ical malignancies: 1. whether viral vaccines are effective in preventing viral infections in patients with hematological malignancies; 2. whether viral vaccines are effective in preventing complications or mortality associated with viral infections, o r reduction in severity of the viral infections, in patients wit h hematological malignancies; 3. whether a particular type of vaccine or dosing schedule is more effective than others in patients with hematological malignancies; 4. whether viral vaccines administered to patients with hematological malignancies are associated with adverse effect s. 3 Vaccines for prophylaxis of viral infections in patients wi th hematological malignancies (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.M E T H O D S Criteria for considering studies for this review T ypes of studies Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the revie w. T ypes of participants Patients of all ages with hematological malignancies, myelomas, were included. T ypes of interventions T rials evaluating all forms of viral vaccines, including influe nza, varicella, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, measles, mumps, rubell a, and poliomyelitis, were included in the review. The control inter ven- tions could be placebo vaccine, no vaccine or an alternative form of vaccine; or alternative dosing regimens or schedules. T ypes of outcome measures Primary outcomes Incidence of the viral infection concerned Secondary outcomes Mortality due to the viral infection All-cause mortality Incidence of complications due to the viral infection Incidence of severe viral infection Rate of hospitalization due to the viral infection In vitro immune response to the vaccine (titre of protective antibodies, T-cell proliferation) Frequency of systemic and local adverse effects Search methods for identication of studies Electronic searches We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled T ri- als (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library June 2010), MEDLINE (1966 to Dec 2009), EMBASE (1980 to Dec 2009) and CINAHL (1982 to Dec 2009). The search strategies for the different electronic databases (using a combination of controlled vocabulary and text word terms) areprovided in the appendices ( Appendix 1 ,Appendix 2 ,Appendix 3,Appendix 4 ). The reference lists of all relevant papers were searched for fu rther studies. Other internet sources were also explored: NHS National Research Register (www.update- software.com/national); NIH Clinical (www.clinicaltrials.gov); rials (www.controlled-trials.com); Digital Dissertations website (www.lib.umi.com/ dissertations); Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System website (www.vaers.org). Searching other resources We also handsearched abstracts from the meetings of the Ameri- can Society of Hematology (ASH), American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO), European Haematology Association (EHA) and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) (1993 to 2009). Articles published only in abstract form would also be included if authors could be contacted to provide essential details for app raisal and analysis. The process of searching many different sources might bring to light direct or indirect references to unpublish ed studies. We would seek to obtain copies of such unpublished ma- terial. In addition, we contacted colleagues and experts in the eld to ascertain any unpublished or ongoing studies. Vaccine manu- facturers listed at the World Health Organization (WHO) websi te were also contacted. There was no language restriction in the search and inclusion of studies. However, multiple publications reporting the same group of patients or subsets of the group would be excluded. Data collection and analysis Selection of studies T wo authors (rst and second authors) independently reviewed titles and abstracts of references retrieved from the searches and se- lected all potentially relevant studies. Copies of these art icles were obtained and reviewed independently by the same authors aga inst our pre-dened inclusion criteria. Authors were not blinded to the names of the trial authors, institutions or journal of publi cation. All disagreements about selection of studies were resolved b y con- sensus. Data extraction and management T wo authors (rst and second authors) independently extracted data from included trials. All disagreements were resolved b y con- sensus. The following data were extracted, when available. 4 Vaccines for prophylaxis of viral infections in patients wi th hematological malignancies (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Since adverse even ts are rarely adequately dealt with by controlled clinical trials , because the numbers are small and follow up too short, adverse events would be discussed by taking into account the non-trial literatu re. Assessment of risk of bias in included studies T wo authors (rst and second authors) independently assessed the quality of each eligible trial. All disagreements were resol ved by consensus. The following items were included to assess the methodologica l quality of RCTs. (1) Selection bias, allocation concealment A. Yes: use of randomization method that did not allow invest i- gator and participant to know or influence the allocation of trea t- ment before eligible participants entered the study.B. Unclear: randomization stated but no information on metho d used was available. C. No: use of alternate medical record numbers or unsealed en- velopes as randomization method, or there was information i n the study indicating that investigators or participants could hav e in- fluenced the allocation of treatment. (2) Performance bias Blinding of care providers: Yes, No, Unclear. Blinding of participants: Yes, No, Unclear. Care providers and patients were considered not blinded if th e intervention group could be identied in > 20% of participants because of the side effects of treatment. (3) Detection bias Blinding of outcome assessors: Yes, No, Unclear. (4) Attrition bias, intention-to-treat analysis A. Yes: all participants were analysed in the treatment group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether of not they re - ceived the allocated intervention. B. No: some participants were not analysed in the treatment gr oup to which they were randomized because they did not receive study intervention or because of protocol violation. C. Unclear: inability to determine if patients were analysed ac- cording to the intention-to-treat principle after contact with th e authors. We summarized the quality of a trial into one of three categori es. A. Low risk of bias: all the validity criteria met. B. Moderate risk of bias: one or more validity criteria partly met but none not met. C. High risk of bias: one or more criteria not met. Measures of treatment effect Relative risk (RR) estimations with 95% condence intervals (CI) were used for binary outcomes. Weighted mean difference (WMD) estimations with 95% CI were used for continuous out- comes. All analyses included all participants in the treatment groups to which they were allocated (intention-to-treat analysi s). Dealing with missing data The authors of included studies were contacted to supply missin g data. Missing data and drop-outs or attrition were assessed f or each included study and the extent to which the results and conclusion s of the review could be altered by the missing data were assesse d and discussed. If less than 70% of patients allocated to the treatm ents were reported on at the end of the trial, for a particular outcom e, those data were considered to be prone to bias. Assessment of heterogeneity Clinical heterogeneity were assessed by comparing the distri bu- tion of important participant factors between trials (age, und er- lying hematological malignancy, phase of treatment), and tria l 5 Vaccines for prophylaxis of viral infections in patients wi th hematological malignancies (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.factors (randomization concealment, blinding of outcome assess - ment, losses to follow up, vaccine regimens). Statistical heter o- geneity was assessed by examining the I2statistic ( Deeks 2009 ), a quantity which approximately describes the proportion of va ri- ation in point estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error. We followed the guide on interpretation of t he I2 statistic as suggested by the Cochrane Handbook: 0% to 40%, might not be important; 60%, may represent moderate heterogeneity; 50% to may represent substantial heterogeneity; 75% to 100%, considerable heterogeneity. In addition, a Chi2test of homogeneity was employed to deter- mine the strength of evidence that heterogeneity was genuine . If signicant heterogeneity (P < 0.1) was present, trials would b e in- vestigated for possible explanations. Sensitivity analys es excluding outlying results would be performed. Assessment of reporting biases Funnel plots (estimated differences in treatment effects agai nst their standard errors) would be drawn if sufcient studies (mo re than 10) were found. Asymmetry could be due to publication bias but could also be due to a relationship between trial size and e ffect size. In the event that a relationship was found, clinical dive rsity of the studies would be examined ( Sterne 2009 ). Data synthesis Where the interventions were the same, or similar enough, we would synthesized results in a meta-analysis if there was no i m- portant clinical heterogeneity. Meta-analyses would be perfo rmed using a xed-effect model (for example the generic inverse vari - ance method for survival data outcomes and the Mantel-Haenszel method for dichotomous data outcomes). Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity If data permitted, we would conduct subgroup analyses for: 1. different age groups (younger than 12 years, 12 to 18 years, older than 18 years); 2. different types of underlying hematological malignancies (acute leukemia, chronic leukemia, lymphoma, etc); 3. different phases of therapy (before chemotherapy, during intensive chemotherapy, during maintenance chemotherapy, post-therapy); 4. whether patients had or had not received hematopoietic stem cell transplant; 5. whether previous similar vaccines have been given (yes, no).Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analyses would be conducted to assess the impact of study quality. These would include: 1. all studies; 2. only those studies with adequate allocation concealment. Sensitivity analyses would also be conducted to assess the imp act of heterogeneity, by excluding those studies with outlying r esults. R E S U L T S Description of studies See:Characteristics of included studies ;Characteristics of ongoing studies . Results of the search The search of CENTRAL ( The Cochrane Library ), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL yielded 194, 125, 326 and 4 results re- spectively. The search of other sources yielded one additional study. There were a total of 565 articles for screening after duplicate s were removed; 557 studies were excluded based on information in the title or abstract. Full texts of the remaining eight studi es were further assessed for eligibility and were included ( Table 1 ). There was one additional RCT that had just completed recruitment and analysis results are pending ( NCT01016548 ). This was therefore excluded from further analyses in the current review. Included studies Altogether, eight RCTs met the inclusion criteria ( Musto 1997 ; Parkkali ;Redman ;Ljungman 2005 ;Safdar 2006 ;Esposito 2010 ). Details of the included studies are given in the ' Characteristics of included studies ' table and are summarized below. The eight trials included a total of 593 people with hematolog ical malignancies, with 305 in the intervention groups and 288 in t he control groups. T wo of the trials evaluated the efcacy of heat- inactivated ). Five trials evaluated influenza vaccines ( Musto 1997 ; Hsieh 2002 ;Ljungman 2005 ;Safdar 2006 ;Esposito 2010 ). In one of these trials, the patients were randomized to three di fferent intervention groups (with nine, six and six participants) of t hree different doses of the recombinant vaccine and one control group (with six participants) of the standard vaccine. One trial evalu ated inactivated poliovirus were no randomized controlled trials on other viral vaccines in pati ents with hematological malignancies. 6 Vaccines for prophylaxis of viral infections in patients wi th hematological malignancies (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Trials on heat-inactivated varicella zoster vaccine trials compared inactivated VZV vac- cine with conventional alone or placebo ( Redman 1997 ;Hata 2002 ). The rst trial included patients who had lymphoma and were scheduled for autologous stem cell transplantation ( Hata 2002 ) while the second trial included patients with leukemia or lymphoma who were to receive autologous or allogeneic stem cel l transplantation ( Redman 1997 ). In the rst trial, the patients in the intervention group received four doses of VZV vaccine, with the rst dose given within the 30 days before stem cell transpl an- tation (SCT), and subsequent doses given at 30, 60, and 90 days after SCT ( Hata 2002 ). Patients in the control group received conventional care without VZV vaccine. The second trial actually included two protocols in two differen t study periods ( Redman 1997 ). In the rst study protocol in 1993, the patients in the intervention group received a single dose of VZV vaccine at one month post-SCT . In the second study protocol in 1994 to 1995, the patients in the intervention group were g iven three doses of VZV vaccine at one, two and three months post- SCT . The rst trial ( Hata 2002 ) included patients 18 to 60 years old while the second trial ( Redman 1997 ) included patients aged 18 to 49 years. The rst trial recruited 119 patients, with 59 rando mly allocated to the intervention group and 60 allocated to the con- trol group ( Hata 2002 ). The baseline characteristics of patients in both groups were not entirely comparable because there were more patients with Hodgkin's disease in the control group and more post-rst remission non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients in th e intervention group. In the second trial, 28 patients were recr uited to the rst protocol, with 14 allocated to the intervention gro up and 14 to the control group ( Redman 1997 ). The second proto- col included 47 participants, with 24 in the intervention group and 23 in the control group. The baseline characteristics of the patients in the two groups were not entirely comparable becaus e there were more patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in the control group in the second protocol. All included patients in both trials had to be seropositive fo r VZV before SCT but there was no history of zoster or exposure to VZ V within one month after SCT . In both trials, the baseline VZV t itre of the participants were between 1:256 and 1:16384 and did not differ between the intervention and control groups. Both tri als reported outcomes of incidence of herpes zoster, mortality due to varicella or herpes zoster, all-cause mortality, frequency of p atients with a 4-fold rise in antibody titres and in vitro mean lymphocy te stimulation index. Both trials also evaluated cytokine prod uction but the results were presented in different ways. The rst tr ial evaluated the percentage of CD4+ T-cells that produced TNF- alpha or Interferon-gamma ( Hata 2002 ) while the second trial re- ported the concentrations of interferon-gamma and interleuki n- 10 (Redman 1997 ). The zoster severity score was reported in the second trial ( Redman 1997 ) but there was no data on compli- cations and hospitalization due to zoster infection in either trial.Frequencies of systemic and local adverse effects were reporte d in both trials. Trials on influenza vaccines T wo of the influenza vaccine trials compared the standard triva- lent inactivated influenza vaccine with no vaccine ( Musto 1997 ; Esposito 2010 ). One trial compared the standard split virus triva- lent inactivated influenza vaccine with three different doses o f a recombinant baculovirus-expressed trivalent influenza vaccin e (Safdar 2006 ). Another trial compared two doses of trivalent in- activated influenza vaccine with a single dose ( Ljungman 2005 ). The remaining trial compared two different schedules involvi ng two doses of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine ( Hsieh 2002 ). The trial by Esposito only included children who had acute lym- phoblastic leukemia or lymphoma ( Esposito 2010 ). The trial by Musto only adults who had multiple myeloma ( Musto 1997 ). The trial by with non- Hodgkin's lymphoma 2006 ). Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia ( Ljungman 2005 ). The trial by Hsieh only included children with acute lymphoblastic leukemi a (Hsieh 2002 ). Patients in these trials had received chemotherapy with or without antibody therapy (rituximab, alemtuzumab or bortezomib). The trial by Esposito randomly allocated 182 patients to recei ve one to two doses (depending on age) of influenza vaccine or no vaccine after stratifying into two groups according to the lengt h of time after completion of chemotherapy (< 6 months or 6 to 24 months) ( Esposito 2010 ). The trial by Musto randomly allocated 50 patients who were undergoing conventional chemotherapy in November 1995 to either receive or not receive influenza vaccine (Musto 1997 ). The trial by Safdar randomly allocated 27 patients to three intervention groups of recombination vaccine at diffe rent doses (15 \u00b5g hemagglutinin protein/0.5 ml, 45 \u00b5g/0.5 ml and 135\u00b5g/0.5 ml) and one control group of standard vaccine at 15 \u00b5g hemagglutinin protein/0.5 ml ( Safdar 2006 ). The timing of vaccination in relation to diagnosis and completion of chemothe r- apy was variable but was at least three months after chemother - apy. The trial by Ljungman randomly allocated 70 patients to a 2- dose regime given four weeks apart or a 1-dose regime ( Ljungman 2005 ). Again the timing of vaccination in relation to diagnosis and completion of chemotherapy was variable but was during or within six months of completion of chemotherapy. The trial by Hsieh randomly allocated 25 patients to two different schedul es of two doses of vaccine ( Hsieh 2002 ). In protocol one (interven- tion group), the rst dose of vaccine was given with re-induction chemotherapy and a second dose was given four weeks later. In protocol two (control group), the rst dose of vaccine was given four weeks before re-induction chemotherapy and a second dose was given with re-induction chemotherapy four weeks later. Previous vaccination history of the participancts and baseline an- 7 Vaccines for prophylaxis of viral infections in patients wi th hematological malignancies (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.tibody levels were not mentioned in any of the ve trials. The baseline characteristics of the participants were not presente d in three trials ( Musto 1997 ;Hsieh 2002 ;Safdar 2006 ). In one of the remaining trials, the baseline characteristics of the particip ants in the intervention and the control groups were not entirely comp a- rable because patients in the control group had a higher median age (Ljungman 2005 ). The trials by Esposito and Musto both re- ported the frequency of upper respiratory infections ( Musto 1997 ; Esposito 2010 ). The trial by Esposito also reported the frequency of lower respiratory tract infections, at least one infection o ther than influenza-like illness, at least one hospitalization, t he num- ber of upper and lower respiratory tract infections, the numbe r of days with fever, the number of antibiotic courses and the numb er of days lost from school ( Esposito 2010 ). The trial by Musto also reported the frequency of upper respiratory illnesses, pneu monia, mortality and hospitalization due to pneumonia, the durati on of febrile respiratory episodes and the number of non-programm ed visits to hospital ( Musto 1997 ). Three trials evaluated the fre- quency of patients with a 4-fold rise in antibody titres four we eks after vaccination ( Hsieh 2002 ;Ljungman 2005 ;Safdar 2006 ). The trial by Ljungman also reported the frequency of patients wit h protective antibodies (titre > 40) ( Ljungman 2005 ) while the trial by Hsieh reported the frequency of patients with seroconversi on (increase in titre from below 40 to no less than 40) ( Hsieh 2002 ). Frequency of adverse effects were mentioned in four trials ( Musto 1997 ;Hsieh 2002 ;Safdar 2006 ;Esposito 2010 ), but in three trials these frequencies were not separately reported for the inter vention and the control groups ( Musto 1997 ;Hsieh 2002 ;Safdar 2006 ). There were no data on incidence of or mortality from influenza infection, all-cause mortality, or complications and hospitali zation due to influenza infection in any of the trials. Trial on inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) There was only one included RCT on IPV vaccine ( Parkkali 1997 ). The trial compared two different dosing schedules of IPV vaccine for patients, aged above 16 years, with hematological malign ancies and who had received matched sibling SCT . The authors aimed to test whether earlier IPV vaccination after SCT induced simil ar immunological responses compared to delayed vaccination post- SCT . Patients in the intervention group in this trial receive d IPV vaccine subcutaneously at 6, 8 and 14 months after SCT while the control group received the vaccine at 18, 20 and 26 months post-SCT . Forty-ve participants were randomized, with 23 al- located to the early vaccination arm and 22 to the late vaccina- tion arm. There were no differences in the gender ratio or medi an age between the two groups. However, there were more patient s with chronic myeloid leukemia in the late vaccination group and more patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease in the ea rly vaccination group. The vaccination history of the participants w as not reported. The geometric mean titres of the participants b e- fore vaccination ranged from 180 to 1029 for the three poliovir usserotypes and were signicantly higher in the early vaccinatio n group compared to the late vaccination group. Outcomes reported were geometric mean antibody titre and the frequency of patie nts with a 4-fold rise in protective antibodies. Risk of bias in included studies Seven of the eight included trials had high risk of bias ( Musto 1997 ;Parkkali 1997 ;Redman 1997 ; Ljungman 2005 ;Esposito 2010 ) and one trial had moderate risk of bias ( Safdar 2006 ) by our pre-dened criteria. Allocation None of the trials reported on randomization sequence genera tion or allocation concealment and hence whether the trials were at ri sk of selection bias is unclear. Blinding Four trials blinded the treating physicians ( Redman 1997 ;Hata 2002 ;Safdar 2006 ;Esposito 2010 ) but only one trial blinded the patients as well ( Safdar 2006 ). Blinding of outcome assessors was unknown in ve trials ( Parkkali 1997 ;Redman 1997 ;Hata 2002 ; Safdar 2006 ;Esposito 2010 ) and not used in the remaining three trials ( Musto 1997 ;Hsieh 2002 ;Ljungman 2005 ). Incomplete The trial Hata ( Hata 2002 ) reported nine drop-outs (15.3%) in the intervention group, including two patients who withdr ew at 30 days for unexplained reasons. For the other seven patie nts, the reasons for drop-out were probably unrelated to vaccinatio n (six did not undergo transplantation after randomization an d one withdrew because of disease progression). There were altoget her 16 patients in the intervention group (27.1%) who did not complet e the intended four doses of vaccine. There were two patient with - drawals (3.3%) in the control group, both because of no transpla n- tation after randomization. For individual outcomes, the am ount of missing data was variable and up to 67.8% for two outcomes (th e proportion of CD4+ T-cells that produced TNF-alpha and the proportion of CD4+ T-cells that produced interferon-gamma). In the trial by Redman Redman 1997 ), there was no drop-out re- ported but missing data occurred in up to 73.9% in the interven- tion and the control groups in one of the outcomes (post-stimula- tion interleukin-10 concentrations at 12 months). In the trial b y Hsieh ( Hsieh 2002 ), no drop-out was reported but missing data occurred in up to 72.7% in the control group in two of the out- comes (seroconversion in influenza A/H1 antibody after one and two doses of vaccine). In the trials by Musto ( Musto was reported but re- ported data were insufcient to assess the amount of missing d ata. 8 Vaccines for prophylaxis of viral infections in patients wi th hematological malignancies (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.In the trial no drop-out was reported and data on outcomes were complete. In the trial by Parkkali ( Parkkali 1997 ), nine drop-outs (34.6%) occurred in the treatment group, including two who died before vaccination, one who had not received the vaccine and six losses to follow up for unknown reasons. There were 12 drop-outs (41.4%) in the control group, including six who died before vaccination, one who relapsed and was not vaccinated, and ve losses to follo w up with unknown reasons. Missing data occurred in up to 31.8% in the control group for several outcomes (4-fold rise of antibod y titres to poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3; and geometric mean titr e of poliovirus antibody to poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3). Other potential sources of bias None of the included trials mentioned the use of intention-to-t reat analysis. In addition, the intervention and the control grou ps were not entirely comparable at baseline in four trials ( Parkkali 1997 ; Redman 1997 ;Hata 2002 ;Ljungman 2005 ). In three trials, the comparability of the two groups at baseline was doubtful becau se of inadequate information ( Musto 1997 ;Hsieh 2002 ;Safdar 2006 ). Effects of interventions There were only trials for evaluation of varicella zoster vacci ne, influenza vaccine and poliomyelitis virus vaccine. There were no included trials evaluating vaccines for hepatitis A, hepatiti s B, measles, mumps or rubella.Trials on varicella zoster vaccine (VZV) VZV no vaccine Primary outcome Incidence of herpes zoster VZV vaccine seemed to be associated with a reduced risk of her- pes zoster (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.00, P = 0.05) when the results of the two included trials ( Redman 1997 ;Hata 2002 ) were combined, but this was not statistically signicant ( Analysis 1.1 ; Figure 1 ). There appeared to be heterogeneity between the two included trials, with one trial showing a dramatic difference in the incidence of herpes zoster between the intervention and the con - trol groups ( Hata 2002 ) and the other trial showing a remarkably similar incidence in the two groups ( Redman 1997 ). This might be explained by the marked differences between the participan ts (different age groups, underlying diseases, types of transp lants re- ceived), which is more heterogeneous in the trial showing the ne g- ative result ( Redman 1997 ). There were also differences between the trials with respect to co-interventions, acyclovir not routi nely given in one trial ) but given during a herpes simplex (HSV) outbreak in another trial ( Redman 1997 ), and the schedules of the vaccines given, which may influence the efcacy of the vaccines. Figure 1. Forest plot of comparison: 1 VZV vaccine vs. no vacc ine, outcome: 1.1 Incidence of herpes zoster. Secondary outcomes Mortality due to infection There was no reported mortality due to varicella or herpes zos ter in any of the treatment groups in the two included trials ( Redman 1997 ;Hata 2002 ) (Analysis 1.2 ).All-cause mortality There was no signicant differences in all-cause mortality betw een the intervention and the control groups ( Analysis 1.3 ;Figure 2) when the results of the two included trials were combined ( Redman 1997 ;Hata 2002 ). 9 Vaccines for prophylaxis of viral infections in patients wi th hematological malignancies (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Figure 2. Forest plot of comparison: 1 VZV vaccine vs. no vacc ine, outcome: 1.3 All cause mortality. In vitro immune response Four-fold rise in VZV antibody titre There was no signicant difference between the intervention a nd the control groups in the frequency of participants who had at least a 4-fold rise in VZV antibody titre when the results of th e two trials were combined ( Redman 1997 ;Hata 2002 ) (Analysis 1.4;Figure 3 ). Figure 3. Forest plot of comparison: 1 VZV vaccine vs. no vacc ine, outcome: 1.4 4-fold rise in VZV antibody titre. Lymphocyte stimulation index When results of the two trials were combined ( Redman 1997 ; Hata 2002 ), the lymphocyte stimulation indices were signicantly higher in the intervention group compared to the control group when measured at three months (MD 7.63, 95% CI 6.60 to 8.66, P < 0.00001), four months (MD 10.92, 95% CI 2.13 to 19.71, P = 0.01) or 12 months (MD 29.45, 95% CI 8.51 to 50.39, P = 0.006) but not at one month or ve to six months after the vaccination ( Analysis 1.5 ;Figure 4 ). 10 Vaccines for prophylaxis of viral infections in patients wi th hematological malignancies (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Figure 4. Forest plot of comparison: 1 VZV vaccine vs. no vacc ine, outcome: 1.5 Lymphocyte stimulation index. Percentages of or interferon-gamma One trial ( Hata 2002 ) reported these outcomes and showed higher percentages of CD4+ T-cells producing TNF-alpha (MD CI 16.57 to 27.43, P < 0.00001) in the intervention group compared to the control group ( Analysis 1.7 ). Post-stimulation interferon-gamma or interleukin-10 ( Redman 1997 ) evaluated these levels and found that the post-stimulation interferon-gamma concentrati onin the intervention group was signicantly higher at one mont h (MD 8.00, 95% CI 2.39 to 13.61, P = 0.005) and four months (MD 74.00, 95% CI 22.75 to 125.25, P = 0.005), but lower at two months (MD -107.00, 95% CI -206.58 to -7.42, P = 0.04) and not signicantly different from the control group at three months, ve months and 12 months ( Analysis 1.8 ). The post-stimulation interleukin-10 concentration in the interve ntion group was signicantly lower at one month (MD -33.00, 95% CI -56.78 to -9.22, P = 0.007) months (MD -56.00, 95% CI -97.22 to -14.78, P = 0.008) but not at two months, three months, ve months and 12 months ( Analysis 1.9 ). Frequency of adverse effects 11 Vaccines for prophylaxis of viral infections in patients wi th hematological malignancies (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Frequency of systemic adverse effects When the results of the two trials were combined ( Redman 1997 ; Hata 2002 ) there seemed to be more systemic adverse effects in the intervention group, which did not reach statistical signi cance (RR 5.94, 95% CI 0.73 to 48.55, P = 0.1) ( Analysis 1.10 ;Figure 5). Figure 5. Forest plot of comparison: 1 VZV vaccine vs. no vacc ine, outcome: 1.10 Frequency of systemic adverse effects. Frequency of local adverse effects After combining the results of the two trials ( Redman 1997 ; Hata 2002 ), signicantly more patients in the intervention group experienced local adverse effects at the injection site (RR 20.94 , 95% CI 2.88 to 152.36, P = 0.003) Analysis 1.11 ;Figure 6 ). 12 Vaccines for prophylaxis of viral infections in patients wi th hematological malignancies (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration.

There were no data on other pre-dened secondary outcomes (in- cidence of complications or severe infections or rate of hospital - ization). Additional outcomes Severity score of herpes zoster One trial Redman 1997 ) reported a signicantly higher herpes zoster severity score in patients who developed herpes zoste r in the control group compared to the intervention group. The mean difference in the score was 2.6 points out of a maximum of 20 points (MD 2.60, 95% CI 0.94 to 4.26, P = 0.002) ( Analysis 1.12). The other included trial just commented that the severity of the herpes zoster did not differ between the intervention and control groups and actual data were not available ( Hata 2002 ). Trials on influenza vaccines Influenza vaccine versus no vaccine Primary outcomeIncidence of influenza There was no data on this pre-dened primary outcome from the included trials ( Musto 1997 ;Esposito 2010 ). Secondary outcomes Mortality due to infection (pneumonia) The mortality due to pneumonia was reported in one included trial ( Musto 1997 ), which was not signicantly different between the intervention and control groups ( Analysis 2.1 ). Incidence of complications Frequency of at least one lower respiratory infection When the results of the two included trials were combined ( Musto 1997 ;Esposito 2010 ), the risk of at least one lower respiratory infection was signicantly lower in the intervention group (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.78, P = 0.008) ( Analysis 2.2 ;Figure 7 ). 13 Vaccines for prophylaxis of viral infections in patients wi th hematological malignancies (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Frequency of at least one infection other than influenza-like illness One trial ( Esposito 2010 ) reported the number of patients with at least one infection other than influenza-like illness and foun d no signicant difference between the intervention and control gr oups (Analysis 2.2 ).Rate of hospitalization When the results of the two included trials ( Musto 1997 ;Esposito 2010 ) were combined, the hospitalization rate was signicantly lower in the intervention group (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.31, P < 0.00001) ( ). One included trial ( Musto 1997 ) also reported that the number of non-programmed visits to hospital was signicantly lower in the intervention group com- pared to the control group (0.5 versus 2.3, P < 0.001). However, the results could not be tabulated or veried. Figure 8.

Figure 9. Forest plot of comparison: 2 Influenza vaccine vs. n o vaccine, outcome: 2.4 Frequency of at least one adverse effects. Frequency of systemic adverse effects One of the included trials ( Esposito 2010 ) reported the frequen- cies of different systemic adverse effects and showed a signi cantly higher frequency of irritability in the intervention group (R R 19, 95% CI 1.12 to 321.07, P = 0.04) ( Analysis 2.5 ). The frequency of other systemic adverse effects, including fever, decreased ap petite, rhinitis, cough and vomiting, were not signicantly differen t be- tween the intervention and control groups ( Analysis 2.5 ).Frequency of local adverse effects When the results of the two included trials were combined ( Musto 1997 ;Esposito 2010 ), the frequency of at least one local adverse effect was signicantly higher in the intervention group (RR 22 , 95% CI 3.05 to 158.51, P = 0.002) ;Figure 10 ). One trial ( Esposito 2010 ) reported the frequency of different local adverse effects (redness, swelling or induration), which were n ot signicantly different between the intervention and control groups (Analysis 2.6 ). 15 Vaccines for prophylaxis of viral infections in patients wi th hematological malignancies (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Figure 10. Forest plot of comparison: 2 Influenza vaccine vs. no vaccine, outcome: 2.6 Frequency of local adverse effects. There were no data on other pre-dened secondary outcomes (all- cause mortality, incidence of severe infections or in vitro immu ne response). Additional outcomes Frequency of at least one upper respiratory infections When the results of the two included trials were combined ( Musto 1997 ;Esposito 2010 ), participants in the intervention group had a signicantly lower risk of experiencing at least one upper re spi- ratory infection (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.72, P < 0.00001) (Analysis 2.7 ). Number of upper respiratory tract infections One included trial ( Esposito 2010 ) reported that the intervention group had signicantly fewer upper respiratory tract infectio ns (MD -1.23, 95% CI -1.52 0.00001) ( Analysis 2.8 ). Number of lower respiratory tract infections One included trial ( Esposito 2010 ) reported that the intervention group had signicantly fewer lower respiratory tract infectio ns (MD -0.3, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.16, P < 0.00001) ( Analysis 2.9 ).Number of infections other than influenza-like illness One included trial ( Esposito 2010 ) reported the outcome of num- ber of infections other than influenza-like illness, which was n ot signicantly different between the intervention and control groups (Analysis 2.10 ). Number of days with fever One included trial ( Esposito 2010 ) reported that the intervention group had signicantly fewer days with fever (MD -1.7, 95% CI courses One included trial ( Esposito 2010 ) reported that the intervention group received signicantly fewer antibiotics courses (MD -1.85, 95% CI -2.3 P < 0.00001) ( Analysis 2.12 ). Number of days lost from school One included trial ( Esposito 2010 ) reported that the intervention group had signicantly lower number of days lost from school (MD -4.94, 95% CI to -4.23, P 2.13 ). 16 Vaccines for prophylaxis of viral infections in patients wi th hematological malignancies (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Duration of febrile respiratory episodes One included trial ( Musto 1997 ) reported that the mean dura- tion of febrile respiratory episodes was signicantly lower in the intervention group compared to the control group (5 days versus 12 days, P < 0.001). However, since no standard deviation, CI or actual P value was provided the results could not be tabulated o r veried. Influenza vaccine, two doses versus single dose Primary outcome Incidence of influenza There were no data on this pre-dened primary outcome from the included trial ( Ljungman 2005 ). Secondary outcomes In vitro immune response Four-fold rise in antibody titre In the trial comparing two doses to one dose of influenza vaccine (Ljungman 2005 ), there was no signicant difference between the two groups in the proportion of patients who attained a 4-fold rise in antibody titres to any of the three components (A/H3, A/H1, B) of the vaccine ( Analysis 3.1 ). Antibody titre above 1:40 Consistent with the above results, there was no signicant di ffer- ence between the intervention and the control groups in the pro - portion of patients who attained antibody titres above 1:40 to any of the three components (A/H3, A/H1, B) of the vaccine ( Analysis 3.2). There were no data on other pre-dened secondary outcomes (mortality due to infection, all-cause mortality, incidence of com - plications or severe infections, rate of hospitalization or f requency of adverse effects).Recombinant influenza vaccine versus standard influenza vaccine Primary outcome Incidence of influenza There were no data on this pre-dened primary outcome from the included trial ( Safdar 2006 ). Secondary outcomes In vitro immune response Four-fold rise in antibody titre In the trial comparing recombinant influenza vaccine to standard inactivated influenza vaccine ( Safdar 2006 ), when the dose of 15 \u00b5g recombinant vaccine was compared to control vaccine, there was no signicant difference between the two groups in the pro- portion of patients who attained 4-fold rise in antibody titr es to any of the three components (A/H3, A/H1, B) of the vac- cine, whether this hemoagglutination inhibi 4.1 ), neutralizing antibody ( Analysis ) or both results combined ( Analysis 4.3 ). When the dose of 45 \u00b5g recombinant vaccine was compared to control vaccine, there was generally no signicant difference be - tween the intervention and the control groups in the proporti on of patients who attained a 4-fold rise in antibody titres to an y of the three components (A/H3, A/H1, B) of the vaccine, whether this was measured by hemoagglutination inhibition ( Analysis 5.1 ), neutralizing antibody ( Analysis 5.2 ) or both results combined (Analysis 5.3 ). The only exception was that there was a marginally signicantly higher frequency of patients in the interventio n group who attained a 4-fold rise in neutralizing antibody titre to t he A/H3 component (RR 4.33, 95% CI 1.03 to 18.17, P = 0.04) (Analysis 5.2 ). When the dose of 135 \u00b5g recombinant vaccine was compared to control vaccine, there was no signicant difference between the intervention and the control groups in the proportion of pati ents who attained a 4-fold rise in antibody titres to any of the thre e components (A/H3, A/H1, B) of the vaccine, whether this was measured by hemoagglutination inhibition ( Analysis 6.1 ), neutral- izing 6.2 ) or both results combined ( Analysis 6.3). There were no data on other pre-dened secondary outcomes (mortality due to infection, all-cause mortality, incidence of com - plications or severe infections, rate of hospitalization or f requency of adverse effects). 17 Vaccines for prophylaxis of viral infections in patients wi th hematological malignancies (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Comparison of different influenza vaccine schedules: rst dose versus second dose given with re-induction Primary outcome Incidence of influenza There were no data on this pre-dened primary outcome from the included trial ( Hsieh 2002 ). Secondary outcomes In vitro immune response Four-fold rise in antibody titre In the trial comparing different influenza schedules of two dos es (Hsieh 2002 ), there was no signicant difference between the two groups in the proportion of patients who attained a 4-fold ris e in antibody titres to any of the three components (A/H3, A/H1, B) of the vaccine after the rst dose ( Analysis 7.1 ) or the second dose (Analysis 7.2 ). Seroconversion Consistent with the above results, there was also no signica nt dif- ference between the two groups in the proportion of patients w ho achieved seroconversion (increase of antibody titre from below 40 to no less than 40) to any of the three components (A/H3, A/H1, B) of the vaccine after the rst dose ( Analysis 7.3 ) or the second dose ( Analysis 7.4 ). There were no data on other pre-dened secondary outcomes (mortality due to infection, all-cause mortality, incidence of com - plications or severe infections, rate of hospitalization or f requency of adverse effects). Trial on inactivated poliovirus vaccine Early schedule versus late schedule Primary outcome Incidence of poliomyelitis There were no data on this pre-dened primary outcome from the included trial ( Parkkali 1997 ).Secondary outcomes In vitro immune response Four-fold rise in antibody titre In the trial comparing early (starting six months after stem cel l transplant) and late (starting 18 months after stem cell trans plant) schedules of inactivated poliovirus vaccine in three doses ( Parkkali 1997 ), there was generally no signicant difference between the two groups in the proportion of patients who attained a 4-fold rise in antibody titres to any of the three poliovirus seroty pes after the rst dose ( Analysis 8.1 ), the second dose ( Analysis 8.2 ) or the third dose of the vaccine ( Analysis 8.3 ). The only exception was that there were signicantly fewer patients in the early sched ule group who attained a 4-fold rise in antibody titre to polio typ e 2 (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.8, P = 0.01) and type 3 (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.96, P = 0.03) after the rst dose ( Analysis 8.1 ). Geometric mean titre of protective antibody The authors reported the geometric mean titres of protective an- tibody to poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 before and after each dose of vaccination. There was no signicant difference between the two groups in any of these antibody titres. Since no standard devi ation, CI or actual P value for these geometric means were provided, t he results could not be tabulated or veried. There were no data on other pre-dened secondary outcomes (mortality due to infection, all-cause mortality, incidence of com - plications or severe infections, rate of hospitalization or f requency of adverse effects). Assessment of reporting biases Since there were at most only two trials reporting on the same comparisons, funnel plots were not constructed. Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity Since no individual or stratied data on pre-dened subgroups were available, subgroup analysis was not performed. Since t here were at most only two trials reporting on the same comparisons , formal investigation of heterogeneity was impossible. Sensitivity analyses Sensitivity analyses were not performed to assess the impact of including studies of different quality since there were only t wo trials at most for all comparisons. Similarly, sensitivity a nalyses were not performed to assess the impact of heterogeneity. 18 Vaccines for prophylaxis of viral infections in patients wi th hematological malignancies (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.D I S C U S S I O N Summary of main results In the current review on the use of viral vaccines for patients with hematological malignancies, evidence from randomized con - trolled trials is limited and available for only three viral diseases, namely varicella zoster virus (VZV), influenza virus and polio virus. There are no included trials evaluating vaccines for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, measles, mumps or rubella. Only the two trials o n VZV vaccine reported our pre-dened primary outcome ( Redman 1997 ;Hata 2002 ). All trials reported some of the pre-dened secondary outcomes. T wo trials on VZV vaccine ( Redman 1997 ; Hata 2002 ) and one trial on influenza vaccine ( Esposito 2010 ) also reported some additional outcomes not pre-dened in the curren t review. There are only two small RCTs evaluating heat-inactivated VZV vaccine compared to no vaccine for patients with leukemia or lym- phoma ( Redman 1997 ;Hata 2002 ). The combined results of the two trials suggest that VZV vaccine might be effective in preven t- ing herpes zoster or reducing the severity of herpes zoster. H ow- ever, the immunogenicity of the vaccine in these patients is in- conclusive. The VZV vaccine is associated with signicantly more local adverse effects. Systemic adverse effects such as headache , arthralgia and myalgia also appear to be more common in vaccine recipients, although this was not statistically signicant. Although there are ve RCTs evaluating influenza vaccines for p a- tients with hematological malignancies, the objectives of the trials and the target patient populations are very heterogeneous. The re- sults from two RCTs ( Musto 1997 ;Esposito 2010 ) could be com- bined. These two trials compared influenza vaccine with no vac- cine in entirely different patient groups, one in adults with multi- ple myeloma undergoing chemotherapy and the other in children who had nished chemotherapy treatment for leukemia or lym- phoma. The pooled results suggest that inactivated influenza vac- cine might be effective in preventing upper and lower respirat ory infections and reducing hospitalization. One trial ( Esposito 2010 ) also suggested that the vaccine may reduce the number of days wit h fever, the number of antibiotics courses and the number of days lost from school. However, it is uncertain whether the reporte d respiratory illnesses and hospitalizations were related t o influenza or not; and there is no conclusive evidence that influenza vaccine reduces influenza-related mortality in patients with hematol ogi- cal malignancies. The trial comparing two doses with one dose of the influenza vaccine in patients with various hematological malignancies within six months of completion of chemotherapy shows no signicant differences in antibody response ( Ljungman 2005 ). The antibody response after different doses of recombinant influenza vaccine was similar to the standard trivalent inactiv ated influenza vaccine in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients who had nished chemotherapy for at least three months ( Safdar 2006 ). The antibody response was also similar whether or not influen za vaccine was given with re-induction chemotherapy in childrenwith acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( Hsieh 2002 ). Systemic and local adverse effects are not uncommon in influenza vaccine re- cipients, although it is uncertain from the trial reports whet her the frequency of adverse effects is different in different typ es of vaccines or different vaccination schedules. For inactivated poliovirus vaccine in adult stem cell transplan t recipients, the antibody response was generally not signica ntly different whether the 3-dose vaccination series was started at six months or 18 months post-transplant, although the frequency o f patients achieving 4-fold rise in antibody titre tended to be l ower with the early schedule ( Parkkali 1997 ). There was no information on adverse effects in the included trial. The patient population and clinical setting in the included tri als were highly variable and therefore a generalizable conclusio n is difcult to make. In adults who have received hematopoietic st em cell transplantation for leukemia or lymphoma, VZV vaccinatio n might be effective is vari- able and there was no signicant difference whether it was give n early or late post-SCT ( Parkkali 1997 ). In adults with hematolog- ical malignancies undergoing or in the period shortly after che mo- therapy, influenza vaccine might reduce upper respiratory infe c- tions and hospitalizations ( Musto 1997 ). However, there was no sigicant difference between one and two doses ( Ljungman 2005 ), or between recombinant and standard vaccine ( Safdar 2006 ). In children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoma, in- fluenza vaccine given within two years of completon of chemother- apy might reduce upper and lower respiratory infections ( Esposito 2010 ). There was no signicant difference whether influenza vac- cine was given with re-induction or not during maintenance che- motherapy ( Hsieh 2002 ). Overall completeness and applicability of evidence High level evidence on the efcacy and safety of viral vaccines in patients with hematological malignancies is scarce, incomple te and limited to varicella zoster, influenza and poliomyelitis viruses only. There are no included trials evaluating vaccines for hepa titis A, hepatitis B, measles, mumps or rubella. Only the two trial s on VZV vaccine reported our pre-dened primary outcome ( Redman 1997 ;Hata 2002 ). All trials reported some of the pre-dened secondary outcomes. T wo trials on VZV vaccine ( Redman 1997 ; Hata 2002 ) and one trial on influenza vaccine ( Esposito 2010 ) also reported some additional outcomes not pre-dened in the curren t review. As the type of underlying malignancies and treatment s are restricted in many of these trials, the results of these trial s cannot be generalized to all patients with hematological malignanci es. VZV vaccine, when given before and after stem cell transplant in adults with lymphoma or leukemia, might be efcacious in re- ducing the incidence and severity of herpes zoster, which paral- lels development of certain cell-mediated immunity ( Hata 2002 ; 19 Vaccines for prophylaxis of viral infections in patients wi th hematological malignancies (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Redman 1997 ). Whether VZV vaccine efcacy in tients with other hematological malignancies or patients tre ated with chemotherapy is uncertain. Influenza vaccine might be effective in reducing the incidence of upper and lower respiratory infections and hospitalizati on in adults with multiple myeloma undergoing chemotherapy ( Musto 1997 ) or children with leukemia and lymphoma who nished che- motherapy in the preceding two years ( Esposito 2010 ). However, it was uncertain what proportions of these infections or hospi - talizations were caused by influenza. There appears to be no si g- nicant difference between one and two doses ( Ljungman 2005 ), recombinant or standard inactivated vaccines (in with non - Hodgkin's lymphoma) ( Safdar 2006 ) or scheduling the dose with or without re-induction chemotherapy (in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia) ( Hsieh 2002 ). However, these negative results might be attributable to inadequate statistical pow er since only small samples have been studied. In addition, the resul ts can- not be generalized to patients with malignancy types differe nt from patients recruited in these trials. The only RCT on inactivated poliovirus vaccine compared differ- ent starting times of the vaccination series after stem cell tra ns- plantation, which demonstrates variable seroresponse to th e vac- cine that does not differ signicantly whether the vaccination w as started at six or 18 months post-transplant ( Parkkali 1997 ). Again the sample size was limited and the conclusion may be falsely ne g- ative. The results are not applicable to patients other than t rans- plant recipients. Adverse effects to these viral vaccines are not uncommon, espe- cially local adverse effects, which occur in up to 60% of patients who have received influenza vaccine ( Musto 1997 ). However, no serious adverse effects are reported in the included RCTs. Sin ce the number of patients recruited in each of these RCTs was small , rare serious adverse events might not have been detected. Quality of the evidence Most of the RCTs included in the current review are considered to have a high risk of bias and hence the quality of the evidence is low. Most of the trials also focused on laboratory outcomes o f immunological response to vaccines instead of clinically releva nt outcomes in terms of morbidity or mortality prevented. As a re sult, whether the surrogate outcomes translate into relevant clini cal benets remains uncertain. All included RCTs recruited only sm all numbers of patients and only one trial ( Hata 2002 ) pre-calculated the sample size; they therefore lack statistical power in dete cting differences between the intervention groups and are suscepti ble to false negative conclusions. A U T H O R S ' C O N C L U S I O N SImplications for practice VZV vaccine might be efcacious in reducing the incidence and severity of herpes zoster when given before and after stem cel l transplant in adults with lymphoma or leukemia. Influenza va c- cine might be effective in reducing the incidence of upper and lower respiratory infections and hospitalization due to pne umo- nia in adults with multiple myeloma undergoing chemotherapy and children with leukemia and lymphoma who nished chemo- therapy in the preceding two years. However, the quality of ev - idence supporting these ndings is low. Adverse effects to the se viral vaccines, both systemic and local, occur frequently althou gh serious adverse effects appear uncommon and most adverse effe cts are tolerable. There is no RCT supporting the use of other vir al vaccines in patients with hematological malignancies. Clinicia ns who wish to administer viral vaccines to these patients should bal- ance the potential benets against the potential risks and di scuss them with patients adequately so that they can make individua l informed choices. Implications for research The existing evidence on the efcacy and safety of viral vaccines f or patients with hematological malignancies is inadequate, inco m- plete and of low quality. Further randomized controlled tria ls are needed to evaluate more of the available viral vaccines. These trials should encompass patients of different age groups and a varie ty of hematological malignancies treated with different modaliti therapy, autologous o r allo- geneic stem cell transplant), although individual trials mig ht be restricted to specic patient population to enhance homogenei ty among trial participants. Ideally, the trials should compare active vaccines against placebo to determine the clinical efcacy of the particular vaccine in these patient groups. T rials comparing di f- ferent forms of vaccines in different doses, dosing schedules a nd timings are also invaluable to inform clinicians on the optima l use of available vaccines. The outcomes employed should be patient - oriented and important, such as all-cause mortality, disease s pe- cic mortality, incidence of severe complications and hospitali za- tions, and incidence of the specic infection and severity scores , in addition to the usual immunological laboratory parameters. The sample size should be pre-calculated to ensure adequate statis tical power to detect important differences in the primary outcome. The conduct of the trials should adhere to the current standards , of which important components include concealed randomization sequence generation; adequate blinding of participants, hea lthcare teams, outcome reporters and analysts; intention-to-treat an aly- ses; and adequate reports of all outcomes and drop-outs. Cost- effectiveness analyses are also needed before appropriate r ecom- mendation can be made on the use of viral vaccines in patients with hematological malignancies. 20 Vaccines for prophylaxis of viral infections in patients wi th hematological malignancies (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration.
