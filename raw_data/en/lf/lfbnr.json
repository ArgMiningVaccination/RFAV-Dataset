Today, I'm speaking with Ruby Warrington, the author of the new book, Women Without Kids, as well as the author and creator of Sober Curious. With both of these creations, she's also known as an astute cultural commentator and true thought leader. I appreciate how Ruby brings much more nuanced, deep thinking and exploration to this topic- from various lifestyle circumstances and choices that go into not having children, to other kinds of legacies, intergenerational trauma and healing, stereotype-busting, and more. We go into all of this, and more, in today's conversation. Since more and more women are not having children for a multitude of reasons- and there will be more of us aging and maturing on the planet in future years, it's time we bring more awareness to what Ruby calls the \"rise of the unsung sisterhood.\" Whether you're a woman with or without kids, please have a listen. This is important! And share it with others too. Enjoy! You can listen to this episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Stitcher, or your favorite podcast platform.

Last year, Chris published the book Creating Healing Circles: Using the Internal Family Systems Model in Facilitating Groups, and has since gone on to lead numerous sold-out IFS Healing Circle facilitation trainings, which I had the pleasure of being part of this past spring. Today, we speak about the power of healing in groups, why this is the medicine we need in these times, and what that can open up for us that one-on-one therapy cannot. In addition, we discuss: the different stages of a group process, keys to being a skilled facilitator, integrating different modalities into groups, how to know if you should do group or individual work, and aspects of ourselves that can be explicitly healed in groups. Plus, towards the end, Chris leads us through a powerful experiential meditation. We go deep and I always find talking and learning with Chris to be inspiring! I know you will, too. Enjoy.

This month, we're going to gain a really eye-opening, empowering perspective on addictive processes. It's a counter-cultural way of looking at things that are often very taboo. To help map this addictive process out for us, I've invited Cece Sykes onto the podcast today. A LCSW, as well a a consultant and senior trainer with the Internal Family Systems Institute, Cece specializes in trauma and addiction and is deeply respected for her contributions in this field.
