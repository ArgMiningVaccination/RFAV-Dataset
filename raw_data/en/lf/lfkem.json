Naturopaths complete a 4 year degree to obtain their qualification in natural medicine (Bachelor of Health Science), and in that period study the traditional sciences as well as herbal medicine, nutrition, homoeopathy, flower essences and counselling. Where a doctor uses pharmaceuticals and surgery to address health complaints, naturopaths provide advice on dietary and lifestyle change, and prescribe herbal and nutritional medicines. Natural remedies are gentle and non-habit forming, and proven effective by hundreds of years of use and more recently, scientific studies. Naturopaths can treat both acute illness and chronic conditions: those lingering health complaints that are temporarily relieved by the medicines from the pharmacy, but are not cured by them. Naturopathy can help people to achieve optimum health and vitality, prevent disease and ultimately take responsibilty for their own health and healing. A naturopath will help you to gain an understanding of your body and how best to take care of it, so you can look and feel your best.
