Based on our ndings that the conventional protocols of direct transmission, minimum-transmission-energy, multi-hop routing, and static clustering may not be optimal for sensor networks, we propose LEACH (Low-Energy Adap- tiveClusteringHierarchy),aclustering-basedprotocolthatutilizes randomized rotation of local cluster base stations (cluster-heads) to evenly distribute the energy load among the sensors in the network.

Introduction Recent advances in MEMS-based sensor technology, low-power analog and digital electronics, and low-power RF design have enabled the development of relatively in- expensive and low-power wireless microsensors [2, 3, 4].These sensors are not as reliable or as accurate as their ex- pensive macrosensor counterparts, but their size and cost enable applications to network hundreds or thousands of these microsensors in order to achieve high quality, fault- tolerant sensing networks. Reliable environment monitor-ing is important in a variety of commercial and military applications. For example, for a security system, acoustic, seismic, and video sensors can be used to form an ad hocnetworktodetectintrusions. Microsensorscanalsobeused tomonitormachinesforfaultdetectionanddiagnosis. Microsensor networks can contain hundreds or thou- sands of sensing nodes. It is desirable to make these nodes as cheap and energy-efcient as possible and rely on their large numbers to obtain high quality results. Network pro-tocols must be designed to achieve fault tolerance in the presence of individual node failure while minimizing en- ergy consumption. In addition, since the limited wireless channel bandwidth must be shared among all the sensors in thenetwork,routingprotocolsforthesenetworksshouldbe able to perform local collaborationto reduce bandwidth wheretheend-usercanaccessthedata. these microsensornetworks. In this work, weconsidermicrosensornetworkswhere:/#0FThe base station is xed and located far from the sen- sors./#0FAllnodesinthenetworkarehomogeneousandenergy-constrained.

Largeen- ergygainscanbeachievedbyperformingthedatafusionor classicationalgorithmlocally,therebyrequiringmuchlessdatatobetransmittedto thebasestation. By analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of con- ventional routing protocols using our model of sensor net- works, we have developedLEACH (Low-EnergyAdaptive ClusteringHierarchy),aclustering-basedprotocolthatmin- imizes energydissipation in sensor networks. The key fea- turesofLEACHare:/#0FLocalized coordination and control for cluster set-upandoperation./#0FRandomized rotation of the cluster \"base stations\" or \"cluster-heads\"andthecorrespondingclusters./#0FLocalcompressiontoreduceglobalcommunication. The use of clusters for transmitting data to the base sta- tion leverages the advantages of small transmit distances for most nodes, requiring only a few nodes to transmit far distances to the base station. However, LEACH out-performs classical clustering algorithms by using adaptive clusters and rotating cluster-heads, allowing the energy re- quirements of the system to be distributed among all the sensors. In addition, LEACH is able to performlocal com- putation in each cluster to reduce the amount of data thatmustbetransmittedtothebasestation. Thisachievesalarge reductionintheenergydissipation,ascomputationismuch cheaperthancommunication. 2. First Order Radio Model Currently, there is a great deal of research in the area of low-energy radios. Different assumptions about the radiocharacteristics, including energydissipation in the transmit and receive modes, will change the advantages of different protocols. In our work, we assume a simple model where the radio dissipatesEelec /= /5/0nJ/bit to run the transmit- ter also assumeanr trans- mita messagea distance dusingourradiomodel,the/1Forexample,theBluetooth initiative [1]species700Kbpsradiosthat operate at 2.7 30 mA, or 115 nJ/bit.Transmit ElectronicsTx Amplifier Receive ElectronicsEelec* kk bit packet amp* d2 Eelec* kd bit costoperation;theprotocolsshouldthustrytominimizenotonly transmit distances but also the number of transmit andreceiveoperationsforeachmessage. We make the assumption that the radio channel is sym- metric such that the energy required to transmit a messagefrom node A to node B is the same as the energy required to transmit a message from node B to node A for a given SNR. For our experiments, we also assume that all sensors are sensing the environmentat a xed rate and thus always havedatatosendtotheend-user. Forfutureversionsofourprotocol, we will implement an \"event-driven\" simulation, wheresensorsonlytransmitdataifsomeeventoccursinthe environment.

Energy AnalysisofRouting Protocols There have been several network routing protocols pro- posed for wireless networks that can be examined in the contextof wireless sensor networks. We examinetwo such protocols, namely direct communication with the base sta-tionandminimum-energymulti-hoproutingusingoursen- sor network and radio models. In addition, we discuss a conventional clustering approach to routing and the draw- backs of using such an approach when the nodes are all energy-constrained. Using a direct communication protocol, each sensor sends its data directly to the base station. If the base sta- tion is far away from the nodes, direct communicationwillrequire a large amount of transmit power from each node (sincedin Equation1 is large). This will quickly drain the battery of the nodes and reduce the system lifetime. How- ever, the only receptions in this protocol occur at the base station, so if either the base station is close to the nodes, orthe energy required to receive data is large, this may be an acceptable (and possibly optimal) method of communica- tion. The second conventional approach we consider is a \"minimum-energy\" routing protocol. There are several power-awareroutingprotocolsdiscussedintheliterature[6, 9, 10, 14, 15]. In these protocols, nodes route data des- tined ultimately for the base station through intermediatenodes. Thus nodes act as routers for other nodes' data in addition to sensing the environment. These protocols dif- fer in the way the routes are chosen. Some of these proto-cols [6, 10, 14], only considerthe energyof the transmitter and neglect the energy dissipation of the receivers in de- termining the routes. In this case, the intermediate nodes are chosen such that the transmit amplier energy (e.g.,ETx /, amp for this minimum-transmission-energy (MTE) routing protocol, rather than just one (high-energy) trans- mitofthedata,eachdatamessagemustgothrough n(low- energy) transmits and nreceives. Depending on the rela- tivecostsofthetransmitamplierandtheradioelectronics, the total energy expended in the system might actually be greater using MTE routing than direct transmission to the basestation. To illustrate this point, consider the linear network shown in Figure 2, where the distance between the nodes is r. If weconsiderthe energyexpendedtransmittinga sin- gle k-bit message from a node located a distance nrfromBase Station rn nodes Figure2.Simplelinear network. the base station using the direct approach and2,we In MTE routing, each node sends a message to the closest nodeonthewaytothebasestation. Thusthenodelocateda distance nrfromthebasestationwouldrequire ntransmits 3, we simulated transmission of data from everynodetothebasestation(located100mfromtheclos- estsensornode,at(x=0,y=-100))usingMATLAB.Figure4 shows the total energy expended in the system as the net- workdiameterincreasesfrom10m /#0210mto100m /#02100 m and the energy expended in the radio electronics (i.e.,Eelec) increases from 10 nJ/bit to 100 nJ/bit, for the sce- nariowhereeachnodehasa2000-bitdatapackettosendtothebase station. Thisshowsthat,aspredictedbyouranal- ysis above, when transmission energy is on the same order asreceiveenergy,whichoccurswhentransmissiondistance is short and/or the radio electronics energy is high, direct transmissionismoreenergy-efcientonaglobalscale thanMTE routing. Thus the most energy-efcient protocol to use dependson the network topologyand radio parameters ofthesystem.

System lifetime using direct trans- mission and MTErouting with0.5J/node. It is clear that in MTE routing, the nodes closest to the base station will be used to route a large number of data messages to the base station. Thus these nodeswill die outquickly, causing the energy required to get the remaining data to the base station to increase and more nodes to die. This will create a cascading effect that will shorten system lifetime. In addition, as nodesclose to the base station die, that area of the environmentis no longer being monitored.To prove this point, we ran simulations using the random 100-node network shown in Figure 3 and had each sensor send a 2000-bitdata packet to the base station during eachtime step or \"round\" of the simulation. After the energy dissipatedinagivennodereachedasetthreshold,thatnode was considered dead for the remainder of the simulation.Figure5showsthenumberofsensorsthatremainaliveafter each round for direct transmission and MTE routing with each node initially given 0.5 J of energy. This plot shows that nodes die out quicker using MTE routing than direct transmission. Figure 6 showsthat nodesclosest to the basestationaretheonestodieoutrstforMTErouting,whereas nodes furthest from the base station are the ones to die out rst for direct transmission. This is as expected, since thenodes close to the base station are the ones most used as \"routers\" for other sensors' data in MTE routing, and the nodesfurthestfromthebasestationhavethelargesttransmit energyindirectcommunication. A nal conventional protocol for wireless networks is clustering, where nodes are organized into clusters that communicatewitha localbasestation,andtheselocalbase stationstransmitthedatatotheglobalbasestation,whereitis accessed by the end-user. This greatly reduces the dis- tance nodes need to transmit their data, as typically the local base station is close to all the nodes in the cluster.

Sensors that remain alive (circles) and those that are dead (dots) after 180 rounds with 0.5 J/node for (a) direct trans- mission and (b)MTErouting. Thus, clustering appears to be an energy-efcient commu- nication protocol. However, the local base station is as- sumed to be a high-energy node; if the base station is an energy-constrained node, it would die quickly, as it is be-ing heavily utilized. Thus, conventional clustering would perform poorly for our model of microsensor networks. The Near Term Digital Radio (NTDR) project [12, 16], anarmy-sponsored program, employs an adaptive clustering approach,similar to our work discussed here. In this work, cluster-heads change as nodes move in order to keep the network fully connected. However, the NTDR protocol is among the sensors in the network. In LEACH, the nodes organize themselves into local clusters, with one node act- ing as the local base station or cluster-head . If the cluster- headswerechosenaprioriandxedthroughoutthesystemlifetime, as in conventionalclusteringalgorithms, it is easy to see that the unlucky sensors chosen to be cluster-heads would die quickly, ending the useful lifetime of all nodesbelongingtothoseclusters. ThusLEACHincludesrandom- ized rotation of the high-energy cluster-head thebatteryofasinglesensor. Inaddition,LEACHperforms local data fusion to \"compress\" the amount of data beingsent from the clusters to the base station, further reducing energydissipationandenhancingsystem lifetime. Sensors elect themselves to be local cluster-heads at any given time with a certain probability. These cluster- head nodes broadcast their status to the other sensors in the network. Each sensor node determines to which clus-ter it wants to belong by choosing the cluster-head that re- quires the minimum communication energy/2. Once all non-cluster-headnode to be turned offatalltimesexceptduringitstransmittime,thusminimizing the energy dissipated in the individual sensors. Once the cluster-headhasallthedatafromthenodesinitscluster,thecluster-headnodeaggregatesthedataandthentransmitsthe compressed data to the base station. Since the base station is far away in the scenario we are examining,this is a high energy transmission. However, since there are only a few cluster-heads,thisonlyaffectsasmallnumberofnodes. As discussed previously, being a cluster-head drains the battery of that node. In order to spread this energy usage over multiple nodes, the cluster-head nodes are not xed;rather,thispositionisself-electedatdifferenttimeintervals. Thusa setCofnodesmightelectthemselvescluster-heads at time t/1, but at time t/1 /+ dan e ws e t C /0of nodes elect themselvesas cluster-heads, as shown in Figure 7. The de- cision to become a cluster-head depends on the amount ofenergy left at the node. In this way, nodes with more en- ergyremainingwill performthe energy-intensivefunctions ofthenetwork. Eachnodemakesitsdecisionaboutwhetherto be a typically this will be the cluster-head closest to the sensor. However, if there is some obstacle impeding the communication between two physically close nodes (e.g., a building, a tree, etc.) such that commu- nication with another cluster-head, located further away, is easier, the sen-sor will choose the cluster-head that is spatially further away but \"closer\"in a communication sense.

The main energy savings of theLEACHprotocolisduetocombininglossycompressionwith the data routing. There is clearly a trade-off between the quality of the output and the amount of compression achieved. In this case, some data from the individual sig-nals is lost, but this results in a substantial reduction of the overallenergydissipationofthe system.

For this exper- iment, each node was initially given 0.5 J of energy. Fig- ure11showsthatLEACHmorethandoublestheusefulsys-tem lifetime comparedwith the alternativeapproaches. We ransimilarexperimentswithdifferentenergythresholdsand found that no matter how much energy each node is given, it takes approximately 8 times longer for the rst node to die and approximately 3 times longer for the last node todie in LEACH as it does in any of the other protocols. The data from these experiments is shown in Table 2. The ad- vantageofusingdynamicclustering(LEACH)versusstaticclustering can be clearly seen in Figure 11. Using a static clustering algorithm,as soon as the cluster-head node dies, all nodes from that cluster effectively die since there is no way to get their data to the base station. While these simu- lations do not account for the setup time to congure thedynamic clusters (nor do they account for any necessary routing start-up costs or updates as nodes die), they give a good rst order approximation of the lifetime extensionwecanachieveusingLEACH.

LEACH Algorithm Details The operation of LEACH is broken up into rounds, whereeachroundbeginswithaset-upphase,whentheclus-ters are organized, followed by a steady-state phase, when data transfers to the base station occur. In order to mini- mize overhead, the steady-state phase is long compared totheset-upphase. 5.1 AdvertisementPhase Initially, when clusters are being created, each node de- cideswhetherornottobecomeacluster-headforthecurrent round. This decision is based on the suggested percentage of cluster heads for the network (determined a priori) andthe number of times the node has been a cluster-head so far.

Future versions ofthisworkwillincludeanenergy-basedthresholdtoaccount for non-uniformenergy nodes. In this case, we are assum- ing that all nodes begin with the same amount of energy and being a cluster-head removes approximately the same amountofenergyforeachnode. Each node that has elected itself a cluster-head for the current round broadcasts an advertisement message to the rest of the nodes. For this \"cluster-head-advertisement\"phase,thecluster-headsuseaCSMAMACprotocol,andall cluster-heads transmit their advertisement using the same transmit energy. The non-cluster-head nodes must keeptheirreceiversonduringthisphaseofset-uptohearthead- vertisementsof all the cluster-head nodes. After this phase iscomplete,eachnon-cluster-headnodedecidesthecluster towhichitwillbelongforthisround. Thisdecisionisbased on the received signal strength of the advertisement. As-suming symmetric propagation channels, the cluster-head advertisement heard with the largest signal strength is the cluster-head to whom the minimum amount of transmitted Proceedings of the 33rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2000 0-7695-0493-0/00 $10.00 (c) 2000 IEEE 8energy is needed for communication. In the case of ties, a randomcluster-headischosen. 5.2 ClusterSet-Up Phase After each node hasdecided to which cluster it belongs, itmustinformthecluster-headnodethatitwillbeamember ofthecluster. Eachnodetransmitsthisinformationbackto the cluster-head again using a CSMA MAC protocol. Dur- ing this phase, all cluster-head nodes must keep their re-ceiverson. 5.3 ScheduleCreation The cluster-head node receives all the messages for nodes that would like to be included in the cluster. Basedonthenumberofnodesinthecluster,thecluster-headnode creates a TDMA schedule telling each node when it can transmit. This schedule is broadcast back to the nodes inthecluster. 5.4 Data Transmission Once the clusters are created and the TDMA schedule is xed, data transmission can begin. Assuming nodes al-ways have data to send, they send it during their allocated transmission time to the cluster head. This transmission uses a minimal amount of energy (chosen based on thereceived strength of the cluster-head advertisement). The radio of each non-cluster-head node can be turned off un- til the node's allocated transmission time, thus minimizing energy dissipation in these nodes. The cluster-head node must keep its receiver on to receive all the data from thenodes in the cluster. When all the data has been received, the cluster head node performs signal processing functions to compress the data into a single signal. For example, ifthe data are audio or seismic signals, the cluster-head node can beamformthe individualsignalsto generatea compos- ite signal. This composite signal is sent to the base station.Sincethebasestationisfaraway,thisisahigh-energytrans- mission. This is the steady-state operation of LEACH networks. After a certain time, which is determined a priori, the next round begins with each node determining if it should be acluster-headforthisroundandadvertisingthisinformation, asdescribedin Section5.1. 5.5.Multiple Clusters The preceding discussion describes how the individual clusters communicate among nodes in that cluster.

In order to verify our assumptions about LEACH, we are currently extending the network simulator ns[11] to simulate LEACH, direct communication, and minimum- transmission-energy routing. This will verify our assump- tionsand give us a more accurate picture of the advantages and disadvantagesof the different protocols. Based on ourMATLAB simulations described above, we are condent that LEACH will outperform conventional communication protocols,intermsofenergydissipation,easeofcongura-tion, and system lifetime/quality of the network. Providing such a low-energy, ad hoc, distributed protocol will help pavetheway forfuturemicrosensornetworks.
