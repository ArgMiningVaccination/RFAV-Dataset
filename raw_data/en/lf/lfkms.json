What Does Your Health Look Like in 10 Years? 20 Years? We seldom ask ourselves this, but is a worthwhile question to ponder. We are at a pivotal time where we must choose our health over everything else, as without our health, life loses meaning. Our health is the sum total of our physical, mental/emotional, and spiritual health. Two things are clear: we can't heal one without the other and there is no one size that fits all. Disease happens by default. Health we create consciously. Doing the deeper inner work to heal on all levels is a necessity if we want to step into our bright future. And the myth that we can do it ourselves is just that - a myth, and resitance at its best. We often miss the hidden cost of keeping the status quo - opportunities missed, aspirations and dreams forgotten. More from Our Happy Clients Debra Schultz Meena Puri is the real deal in Ayurveda and self care. I have a hard time grasping the concepts in Ayruveda but I trust Meena so I don't question her advice. She is caring, highly knowledgeable and soft spoken. I have learned how to meditate from her and practice Kundalini Yoga. Her vegetarian cooking is delicious. Try one of her panckharma therapies for a total relaxing experience. Invest in yourself with Meena. You will not be disappointed. Karen Baron Meena with her knowledge of Ayurveda and Yoga has had such a positive meaningful influence of living in my day to day experiences. Her practice offers a holistic approach creating lifestyle changes to Balance Body and Mind. I truly trust and embrace all her individual attention. I have been with Meena for ten years and thank you for changing and enriching my life with peace and happiness. Stephanie Krogsted I began seeing Meena in the spring of 2018 after having digestive issues. My doctor was unable to pinpoint the source of the problem but Meena asked questions regarding my diet and eating habits and attitudes about food. She then suggested a plant based diet and helped me to develop a new lifestyle that focused on awareness. This comprehensive plan alleviated my symptoms very quickly. I would highly recommend the Ayeurvedic approach and Meena for her knowledge, guidance and wisdom. She has been a blessing on my path to emotional, spiritual and physical healing. Colleen Kilpatrick Meena was a life saver - literally! I visited her office because I was feeling intense anxiety that made my heart feel like it was beating laboriously. She put one hand on my upper back and one hand on my upper chest and listened intently. She then told me there was a mechanical issue with my heart and that I needed to see a cardiologist immediately. She was absolutely right. A couple days later I had emergency open heart surgery for a ruptured valve. I consider Meena one of the angels who saved my life. She is a kind, caring soul who takes the time to really get to know and understand her patients unique health situation and goals. He wisdom runs deep and her knowledge of all aspects of body, mind and spirit is vast. I consider myself fortunate to have such a gifted practitioner of Ayurveda and Yoga in my life. I highly recommend her to anyone seeking optimal health. Leila T. Meena Puri is an amazing healer and spiritual guide. She is attentive, caring, and proactive. I am very blessed to have found such a genuine, skilled practitioner to help me care for my body temple on this journey. Furthermore, her assessments of disease and ailments are never separate from the heart and spirit, which is the missing link with many medical practitioners. To anyone who is searching for an excellent Ayurvedic specialist, I wholeheartedly recommend Meena Puri. Suzy Morris Don't wait, connect with Meena now!! Jeff Petrucci Padmini I am fortunate to have Meena Puri in my world. Her teachings are practical and easy to follow. The change is instant and permanent because her masterful meditations make one align body and mind through heart. That in turn unifies the perception of self, surroundings and beyond. I would recommend her to anyone, even if they do not have an issue. My daughter, born and raised in USA, attended one of Meena's yoga sessions along with me and she told me- \"I like your yoga teacher\"!. - Padmini Kathy Murlick I am so pleased with my spiritual journal with Meena. I have always struggled with the intellectual self. She is teaching me to stop thinking and just be. It is a hard lesson to learn to feel from the heart and not the mind. Every week we make progress and I look forward to the next meeting! Denise Rackham I have been on my healing journey for a long time. I have been working on all aspects of my life bringing in all sorts of healing modalities to help my body restore it self to perfect balance. But there was just something in my sacral Chakra I could not heal it was buried too deep. And my Throat Chakra was restricted as well. My throat would not allow my singing voice to come out. I knew I needed to turn to an Ayurvedic Master to complete my healing. I found my Master Meena was able to shed light and tune into the root of my problems and taught me how to go within and heal my trauma. All healing comes from within and it was so helpful to have met such a beautiful soul that listens and creates a safe space for me to open up so she could tune right into the the areas of my life to truly heal. My singing voice is back and the rest of me has made a huge shift that now I can bring what I have learned and share with others who are on their healing journey. Thank you from the bottom of my heart Meena you are a light unto this world and I appreciate all you have done for me.

I joined in the hopes to address my anxiety and depression. Western therapy didn't connect with me yet Meena's approach was just the right thing. She is calm, knowledgable and wise. Meena gently guides to deeper and calmer understanding of mental health issues and life in general. I feel great and have the necessary tools to taken on further life challenges. Paul Woods Playing in the N. H.L. for almost 8 years, took a toll on my body and resulted in many injuries and surgeries that ended my playing career. I became very stiff and had to endure a lot of pain and functioning on a daily basis became a challenge. I had a hard time skating and had to give up hockey and other sports that I loved to play. Simple things like getting in and out of the car, bending down, getting out of bed and just using my body to live became very difficult. Along with that, I had chronic congestion that also affected the quality of my sleep. Telling my story to countless doctors and therapists left me frustrated as no one really listened or did anything of value to really help me besides prescribing more pain medication. Meena Puri was the first person who not only understood my physical problems but provided me with concrete steps and solutions to address those issues. That was a welcome relief and gave me confidence that I could get better. Now after working with Ms. Puri for over a year and making lifestyle changes including nutrition, here are my results: I am skating again and have been coaching hockey this summer. My congestion is gone. I sleep soundly and through the night. I have stopped taking all pain medication. No more side effects. My posture and body alignment is much improved. I feel more fluid and confident in my body and its ability to heal. Overall weight and body fat is reduced. Most importantly, this is only the beginning. I plan on getting better and better and restoring the quality of my life. Working with Ms. Puri and following her guidelines has been the key to my improvement and I am forever grateful. "}
