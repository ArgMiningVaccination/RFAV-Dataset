I'll assess your Ayurvedic birth constitution or dosha type through questioning, observation and Ayurvedic pulse analysis. You'll leave with a clear picture of your doshas & some action items to regain your balance. What does a wellness plan entail? Your personal wellness plan is a roadmap to help you achieve your wellness goals. You'll gain an understanding of your doshas and how to balance with foods & lifestyle practices. You'll learn the fundamentals of Ayurveda and self-care tools to feel your best. How is Ayurveda different from other health modalities? Ayurveda is the oldest form of functional medicine and focuses on the root cause of illness. It works to prevent disease at the source, rather than solely treating symptoms. By aligning with nature's rhythms, you'll experience balanced wellness and more ease. Do I need to be vegetarian to practice Ayurveda? Absolutely not. Ayurveda recognizes that each individual is unique and there is no 'one-size fits all' approach. Ayurveda works with all diets - vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, etc. Can Ayurveda help with anxiety? Yes, its multi-faceted approach works to heal the physical, mental and spiritual bodies. You'll learn lifestyle practices, diet, self-care and breath work to manage your anxiety and feel better. How long does it take to see results? Most clients see immediate improvements in their wellness. Our bodies naturally want to be in balance. We just need to give ourselves the time and space to heal.
