LIST OF KEY GUIDE ON NONCLINICAL OVERVIEW AND SUMMARIES: This guide provides recommendations for the harmonization of the Nonclinical Overview, Nonclinical Written and Tabulated Summaries. The primary purpose of nonclinical written and tabulated summaries should be to provide a comprehensive, factual synopsis of the nonclinical data. The interpretation of the data, the clinical relevance of the findings, cross-linking with the quality aspects of the pharmaceutical, and the implications of the nonclinical findings for the safe use of the pharmaceutical (i.e. as applicable to labeling) should be addressed in the nonclinical overview. SECTION B: NONCLINICAL OVERVIEW The nonclinical overview should provide an integrated, overall analysis of the information in the Common Technical Document. 1. GENERAL ASPECTS The nonclinical overview should present an integrated and critical assessment of the pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, and toxicologic evaluation of the pharmaceutical. Where relevant guidances on the conduct of studies exist, these should be taken into consideration, and any deviation from these guidances should be discussed and justified. The nonclinical testing strategy should be discussed and justified. There should comment on the good laboratory practice (GLP) status of the studies submitted. Any association between nonclinical findings and the quality characteristics of the human pharmaceutical, the results of clinical trials, or effects seen with related products should be indicated, as appropriate. Except for Biologics and Vaccine, an assessment of the impurities and degradants present in the drug substance and product should be included, along with what is known of their potential pharmacologic and toxicologic effects. This assessment should form part of the justification for proposed impurity limits in the drug substance and product and be appropriately cross-referenced to the quality documentation. The implications of any differences in the chirality, chemical form, and impurity profile between the compound used in the nonclinical studies and the product to be marketed should be discussed. For Biologics and Vaccine, comparability of material used in nonclinical and clinical studies and proposed for marketing should be assessed. If a drug product includes a novel excipient, an assessment of the information regarding the excipient's safety should be provided. Relevant, scientific literature and the properties of related products should be taken into account. If details references to published, scientific literature are to be used in place of studies conducted by the applicant, this should be supported by an appropriate justification that reviews the design of the studies and any deviations from available guidances. In addition, the availability of information on the quality of batches of drug substances used in these referenced studies should be discussed. The Nonclinical Overview should contain appropriate reference citations to the Tabulated Summaries in the following format: (Table X.X, Study/Report Number). 38 of 155 2. CONTENT AND STRUCTURAL FORMAT The Nonclinical Overview should be presented in the following sequence: NONCLINICAL OVERVIEW 1. Overview of the Nonclinical Testing Strategy 2. Pharmacology 3. Pharmacokinetics 4. Toxicology 5. Integrated Overview and Conclusions 6. List of Literature Citations Studies conducted to establish the pharmacodynamic effects, the mode of action, and potential side effects should be evaluated, and consideration should be given to the significance of any issues that arise. The assessment of the pharmacokinetic, toxicokinetic, and metabolism data should address the relevance of the analytical methods used, the pharmacokinetic models, and the derived parameters. It might be appropriate to cross-refer to more detailed consideration of certain issues within the pharmacology or toxicology studies (e.g., impact of the disease states, changes in physiology, antiproduct antibodies, cross-pieces consideration of toxicokinetic data). Inconsistencies in the data should be discussed. Inter-species comparisons of metabolism and systemic exposure comparisons in animals and humans (AUC, Cmax, and other appropriate parameters) should be discussed and the limitations and utility of the nonclinical studies for prediction of potential adverse effects in humans highlighted. The onset, severity, and duration of the toxic effects, their dose dependency and degree of reversibility (or irreversibility), and species- or gender-related differences should be evaluated and important features discussed, particularly with regard to: Pharmacodynamics Toxic signs Causes of death Pathologic findings Genotoxic activity ---- the chemical structure of the compound, its mode of action, and its relationship to known genotoxic compounds Carcinogenic potential in the context of the chemical structure of the compound, its relationship to known carcinogens, its genotoxic potential, and the exposure data Carcinogenic potential in the context of the chemical structure of the compound, its relationship to known carcinogens, its genotoxic potential, and the exposure data The carcinogenic risk to humans - if epidemiologic data are available, they should be taken into account Fertility, embryofetal development, pre- and postnatal toxicity Studies in juvenile animals The consequences of use before and during pregnancy, during lactation, and during pediatric development Local tolerance Other toxicity studies and / or studies to clarify special problems 39 of 155 The evaluation of toxicology studies should be arranged in a logical order so that all relevant data elucidating a certain effect and/or phenomenon are brought together. Extrapolation of the data from animals to humans should be considered in relation to: Animal species used Numbers of animals used Routes of administration employed Dosages used Duration of treatment or of the study Systemic exposures in the toxicology species at no observed adverse effect levels and at toxic doses, in relation to the exposures in humans at the maximum recommended human dose. Tables or figures summarizing this information are recommended The effect of the drug substance observed in nonclinical studies in relation to that expected or observed in humans If alternatives to whole animal experiments are employed, their scientific validity should be discussed. The integrated overview and conclusions should clearly define the characteristics of the human pharmaceutical, as demonstrated by the nonclinical studies, and arrive at logical, well- argued conclusions supporting the safety of the product for the intended clinical use. Taking the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology results into account, the implications of the nonclinical findings for the safe human use of the pharmaceutical should be discussed (i.e. as applicable to labeling). SECTION C: NONCLINICAL WRITTEN AND TABULATED SUMMARIES 1. GUIDANCE ON NONCLINICAL WRITTEN SUMMARIES 1.1 Introduction This guidance is intended to assist authors in the preparation of nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology written summaries in an appropriate format. This guidance is not intended to indicate what studies required. It merely indicates an appropriate format for the nonclinical data that have been acquired. The sequence and content of the Nonclinical Written Summary sections are described below. It should be emphasized that no guidance can cover all eventualities, and common sense and a clear focus on the needs of the regulatory assessor are the best guides to constructing a document. Therefore, applicants can modify the format, if needed, to provide the best possible presentation of the information and to facilitate the understanding and evaluation of the results. Whenever appropriate, age- and gender-related effects should be discussed. Relevant findings with stereoisomers and / or metabolites should be included, as appropriate. Consistent use of units throughout the Nonclinical Written Summaries will facilitate their review. A table for converting units might be also useful. In the Discussion and Conclusion sections, information should be integrated across studies and across species, and exposure in the test animals should be related to exposure in humans given the maximum intended doses. 40 of 155 1.2 General Presentation Issues Order of Presentation of Information Within Sections When available, in vitro studies should precede in vivo studies. Where multiple studies of the same type are summarized within the Pharmacokinetics and Toxicology sections, studies should be ordered by species, by route, and then by duration (shortest duration first). Species should be ordered as follows: Mouse Rat Hamster Other rodent Rabbit Dog Nonhuman primate Other nonrodent mammal Nonmammals Routes of administration should be ordered as follows: The intended route for human use Oral Intravenous Intramuscular Intraperitoneal Subcutaneous Inhalation Topical Other Use of Tables and Figures Although the Nonclinical Written Summaries are envisaged to be composed mainly of text, some information contained within them might be more effectively and / or concisely communicated through the use of appropriate tables or figures. To allow authors flexibility in defining the optimal structure for the written summaries, tables and figures should preferably be included within the text. Alternately, they could be grouped together at the end of each of the Nonclinical Written Summaries. Throughout the text, reference citations to the Tabulated Summaries should be included in the following format: (Table X.X, Study/Report Number). Length of Nonclinical Written Summaries Although there is no formal limit to the length of the Nonclinical Written Summaries, it is recommended that the total length of the three Nonclinical Written Summaries in general not exceed 100-150 pages. Sequence of Written Summaries and Tabulated Summaries The following order is recommended: Introduction Pharmacology written summary 41 of 155 Pharamcology tabulated summary Pharmacokinetics written summary Pharmacokinetics tabulated summary Toxicology written summary Toxicology tabulated summary 2. CONTENT OF NONCLINICAL WRITTEN AND TABULATED SUMMARIES INTRODUCTION The aim of this section should be to introduce the reviewer to the pharmaceutical and to its proposed clinical use. The following key elements should be covered: Brief information concerning the pharmaceutical's structure (preferably, a structure diagram should be provided) and pharmacologic properties. Information concerning the pharmaceutical's proposed clinical indication, dose, and duration of use. 2.1 PHARMACOLOGY 2.1.1 WRITTEN SUMMARY Within the Pharmacology Written Summary, the data should be presented in the following sequence: Brief summary Primary pharmacodynamics / Immunogenicity Study Secondary pharmacodynamics Safety pharmacology Pharmacodynamics drug interactions Discussion and conclusions Tables and figures (either here or included in text) Brief Summary The principal findings from the pharmacology studies should be briefly summarized in approximately two to three pages. This section should begin with a brief description of the content of the pharmacologic data package, pointing out any notable aspects such as the inclusion and / or exclusion of particular data (e.g. lack of an animal model). 2.1.1.1 Primary Pharmacodynamics / Immunogenicity Study Studies on primary pharmacodynamics should be summarized and evaluated. Where possible, it would be helpful to relate the pharmacology of the drug to available data (e.g. selectivity, safety, potency) on other drugs in the class. A pharmacodynamic study for a vaccine product is generally conducted to evaluate the immunogenicity. However, a pharmacodynamics study may also extend to include the pharmacology of an adjuvant. Immunization studies in animal models should be conducted because they may provide valuable \"proof of concept\" information to support a clinical development plan. In addition, immunogenicity data derived from appropriate animal models are useful in establishing the immunological characteristics of the product and may guide selection of the doses, schedules and routes of administration to be evaluated in clinical trials. 42 of 155 Nonclinical immunogenicity studies should assess the relevant immune response, e.g. humoral and/or cell-mediated immune response, induced in the vaccinated animals. 2.1.1.2 Secondary Pharmacodynamics Studies on secondary pharmacodynamics should be summarized by organ system, where appropriate, and evaluated in this section. 2.1.1.3 Safety Pharmacology Safety pharmacology studies should be summarized and evaluated in this section. In some cases, secondary pharmacodynamics studies can contribute to the safety evaluation when they predict or assess potential adverse effects in humans. In such cases, these secondary pharmacodynamics studies should be considered, along with safety pharmacology studies. 2.1.1.4 Pharmacodynamics Drug Interactions If they have been performed, pharmacodynamics drug interaction studies should be briefly summarized in this section. Discussion and Conclusions This section provides an opportunity to discuss the pharmacologic evaluation and to consider the significance of any issues that arise. Tables and Figures Text tables and figures can be included at appropriate points throughout the summary within the text. Alternatively, tables and figures can be included at the end of the summary. 2.1.2 PHARMACOLOGY TABULTED SUMMARY (SEE APPENDIX A) 2.2 PHARMACOKINETICS 2.2.1 WRITTEN SUMMARY The sequence of the Pharmacokinetics Written Summary should be as follows: Brief Summary Method of analysis Absorption Distribution Metabolism (Inter-species Comparison) Excretion Pharmacokinetic drug interactions Other pharmacokinetic studies Discussion and conclusions Tables and figures (either here or included in text) Brief Summary The principal findings from the pharmacokinetics studies should be briefly summarized in approximately two or three pages. This section should begin with a description of the scope of the pharmacokinetic evaluation, emphasizing, for example, whether the species and strains 43 of 155 examined were those used in the pharmacology and toxicology evaluations, and whether the formulations used were similar or identical. Method of Analysis This section should contain a brief summary of the methods of analysis for biological samples, including the detection and quantification limits of an analytical procedure. If possible, validation data for the analytical method and stability of biological samples should be discussed in this section. The potential impact of different methods of analysis on the interpretation of the results should be discussed in the following relevant sections. 2.2.1.1 Absorption The following data should be summarized in this section: Absorption (extent and rate of absorption, in vivo and in situ studies) Kinetic parameters, bioequivalence and / or bioavailability (serum / plasma / blood PK studies) 2.2.1.2 Distribution The following data should be summarized in this section Tissue distribution studies Protein binding and distribution in blood cells Placental transfer studies 2.2.1.3 Metabolism (inter-species comparison) The following data should be summarized in this section: Chemical structures and quantities of metabolites in biological samples Possible metabolic pathways Presystemic metabolism (GI / hepatic first-pass effects) P450 studies Enzyme induction and inhibition 2.2.1.4 Excretion The following data should be summarized in this section: Routes and extent of excretion Excretion in milk 2.2.1.5 Pharmacokinetic Drug Interaction If they have been performed, nonclinical pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies (in vitro and / or in vivo) should be briefly summarized in this section. 2.2.1.6 Other Pharmacokinetic Studies If studies have been performed in nonclinical models of disease (e.g. renally impaired animals), if they should be summarized in this section. 44 of 155 Discussion and Conclusions This section provides an opportunity to discuss the pharmacokinetic evaluation and to consider the significance of any issues that arise. Tables and Figures Text tables and figures can be included at appropriate points throughout the summary within the text. Alternatively, there is the option of including tables and figures at the end of the summary. 2.2.2 PHARMACOKINETICS TABULATED SUMMARY (SEE APPENDIX A) 2.3 TOXICOLOGY 2.3.1 WRITTEN SUMMARY The sequence of the Toxicology Written Summary should be as follows: Brief summary Single-dose toxicity Repeat-dose toxicity Genotoxicity Carcinogenicity Reproductive and developmental toxicity Studies in juvenile animals Local Tolerance Other toxicity studies Discussion and conclusions Tables and figures (either here or included in text) Brief Summary The principal findings from the toxicology studies should be briefly summarized in a few pages (generally not more than six). In this section, the extent of the toxicologic evaluation can be indicated by the use of a table listing the principal toxicologic studies (results should not be presented in this table), for example: Toxicology Program Study type and duration Route of administration Species Compound administered* Single-dose toxicity po and iv Rat and mouse Parent drug Single-dose toxicity po and iv Rat and mouse Metabolite X Repeat-dose toxicity 1 month po Rat and dog Parent drug 6 month po Rat Parent drug 9 month po Dog Parent drug *This column should be included only if metabolites are investigated. 45 of 155 The scope of the toxicologic evaluation should be described in relation to the proposed clinical use. A comment on the GLP status of the studies should be included. 2.3.1.1 Single-dose Toxicity The single-dose data should be very briefly summarized, in order by species and by route. In some instances, it may be helpful to provide the data in the form of a table. 2.3.1.2 Repeat-Dose Toxicity Studies should be summarized in order by species, by route, and by duration, giving brief details of the methodology and highlighting important findings (e.g. nature and severity of target organ toxicity, dose (exposure) and / or response relationships, no observed adverse effect levels). Nonpivotal studies can be summarized in less detail (pivotal studies are the definitive GLP studies specified by ICH guidance M3). 2.3.1.3 Genotoxicity Studies should briefly summarized in the following order: In vitro nonmammalian cell system In vitro mammalian cell system In vivo mammalian system (including supportive toxicokinetics evaluation) Other systems 2.3.1.4 Carcinogenicity (Including supportive toxicokinetics evaluation) A brief rationale should explain why the studies were chosen and the basis for high-dose selection. Individual studies should be summarized in the following order: Long-term studies (in order by species), including range-finding studies that cannot appropriately be included under repeat-dose toxicity or pharmacokinetics) Short- or medium-term studies (including range-finding studies that cannot appropriately be included under repeat-dose toxicity or pharmacokinetics) Other studies 2.3.1.5 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity (including range-finding studies and supportive toxicokinetics evaluations) Studies should be summarized in the following order, giving brief details of the methodology ad highlighting important findings: Fertility and early embryonic development Embryofetal development Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function Studies in which the offspring (juvenile animals) are dosed and / or further evaluated if such studies have been conducted If modified study designs are used, the subheadings should be modified accordingly. 2.3.1.6 Local tolerance If local tolerance studies have been performed, they should be summarized in order by species, by route, and by duration, giving brief details of the methodology and highlighting important findings. 46 of 155 2.3.1.7 Other Toxicity Studies (if available) If other studies have been performed, they should be summarized. When appropriate, the rationale for conducting the studies should be provided. Antigenicity Immunotoxicity Mechanistic studies (if not reported elsewhere) Dependence Studies on metabolites Studies on impurities Other studies Discussion and Conclusions This section should provide an opportunity to discuss the toxicologic evaluation and the significance of any issues that arise. Tables or figures summarizing this information are recommended. Tables and Figures Text tables and figures can be included at appropriate points throughout the summary within the text. Alternatively, tables and figures can be included at the end of the summary. 2.3.2 TOXICOLOGY TABULATED SUMMARY (SEE APPENDIX A) GUIDANCE ON NONCLINICAL TABULATED SUMMARIES It is recommended that summary tables for the nonclinical information in the Common Technical Document be provided in the format outlined in this guidance. Applicants can modify the format, if warranted, to provide the best possible presentation of the information and to facilitate the understanding and evaluation of the results. This guidance is not intended to indicate what studies are requested, but solely to advise how to tabulate study results if a study is performed. Applicants can add some items to or delete some items from the cited format, where appropriate. One tabular format can contain results from several studies. Alternatively, it may be appropriate to cite the data resulting from one study in several tabular formats. The recommended formats for the tables in the Nonclinical Tabulated Summaries are provided in Appendices A, which follow. Appendix A contains templates for use in preparation of the tables. The templates are annotated (in italics) to provide guidances on their preparation. (The italicized information should be deleted when the tables are prepared). However, it is the responsibility of the applicant to decide on the best possible presentation of the data for each product. Authors should keep in mind that, in some regions, a review of the Tabulated Summaries (in conjunction with the Written Summaries) represents the primary review of the nonclinical information. Presentation of the data in the formats provided as templates and examples should ensure that a sufficient level of detail is available to the reviewer and should provide concise overviews of related information. When a juvenile animal study has been conducted, it should be tabulated using the template appropriate for the type of study. 47 of 155 The order of presentation given for the Nonclinical Written Summaries should be followed for the preparation of the tables for the Nonclinical Tabulated Summaries. SECTION D: NONCLINICAL STUDY REPORTS For ASEAN member countries, the Study Reports of this part may not be required for NCE, Biologics, Vaccine, and other Major Variation Products if the Original Products are already registered and approved for market authorization in Reference Countries. This guidance presents an agreed upon format for the organization of the nonclinical reports in the Common Technical Document for applications that will be submitted to regulatory authorities. This guidance is not intended to indicate what studies are required. It merely indicates an appropriate format for the nonclinical data that have been acquired. The appropriate location for individual animal data is in the study report or as an appendix to the study report. 1. TABLE OF CONTENTS A Table of Contents should be provided that lists all of the Nonclinical Study Reports and gives the location of each study report in the Common Technical Document. 2.
