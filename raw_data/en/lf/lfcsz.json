However, most people often realize that chronic pain and inflammation are a result of toxic buildup and waste in the body that literally gets in the way of optimal function. While we're definitely not suggesting there is a one-size-fits-all solution or \"silver bullet\" for resolving chronic pain, starting your healing journey with a detoxification program can help get rid of distracting toxins and instead help your body (and mind) focus on the root cause of your pain. Are you intrigued, but have no idea what an intense detox even includes? Don't fret. By combining the powerful forces of niacin and our ever-so-beloved [infrared](https://higherdose.com/pages/services), your body will get the ultimate deep detox alongside an even deeper dose. Say 'hello' to a niacin flush. Here's how it all works. What is Niacin? Niacin is basically famous in the health and wellness community. It's Vitamin B3 created by a combination of nicotinic acid and niacinamide. Nicotinic acid is used to reduce cholesterol levels, while niacinamide helps to treat psoriasis. Put the two together, and you get the wonder that is niacin. You can also get your niacin fix from food. It carries the energy-providing benefits of any B vitamin while standing in as a powerful antioxidant. In other words: It's like an insane boost for your health on a cellular level, protecting your body from free radicals brought on by oxidative stress. Why We Love Niacin Niacin boosts your brain function, meaning you can wave goodbye to that afternoon fog. On top of that, it improves your skin function, giving you that glow you've dreamed of. Sun damage? No thanks! If joint mobility is a daily struggle, using niacin to replace your anti-inflammatories can be a gamechanger. Why You Need A Niacin Detox Don't be fooled: Just because you can't see environmental toxins and heavy metals doesn't mean they aren't affecting your health. Toxins are stored in our fat and brain tissue, which lingers in the body and can heavily impact all of our essential systems that are meant to protect our immune systems and naturally detox our bodies. While sweating (especially using infrared heat) is an iconic way to eliminate toxins, adding in a niacin detox takes your ability to get rid of chemicals and waste like: - Mercury, manganese, lead, aluminum, cadmium - Pharmaceutical drugs - Formaldehyde, chlorines - Food preservatives - Pesticides & herbicides - Anesthetics - Plastics How To Do A Niacin Detox TL;DR: A niacin detox involves taking a high dose of niacin in tandem with moderate-to-heavy exercise. The goal? Mobilize and stimulate the breakdown of fats, so as to \"loosen\" up the storage of toxins. While one of the best, most efficient detoxes you can do, the niacin detox is definitely a commitment and is meant to be something done consistently over a period of time vs. a one-and-done DOSE. Most protocols can last up to 4 weeks and include a mixture of: - Daily warmup exercises - Elongated infrared sauna sessions - Supplementation Don't rush it, it's a process. It takes several sessions in the infrared sauna to restore the skin's ability to eliminate. Also, when supplementing niacin, you need to work your way up. Everybody is different, and you need to figure out the dosage that works for you. During your infrared treatments, the toxins stored inside your bloodstream begin to break down. By taking niacin, you'll experience a \"flushing\" sensation within 5-10 minutes of starting your protocol. FYI: Niacin flushes can make skin rashes, red skin, or blotches show up as a result of the detox, but that is just your body building a tolerance. Regardless, make sure to consult with a practitioner for an optimal DOSE of niacin before diving into this deep detox. Doctors also recommend taking a binder to truly round-off the detoxification protocol. Activated charcoal tablets come out on top as incredibly safe and effective in removing toxins from your GI tract. Combine this with capsules of chlorella, emothion, bentonite (blue clay), and omega-3s for ongoing detox support. After your sauna session, Vitamin C is a must-have, along with minerals like magnesium and calcium.
