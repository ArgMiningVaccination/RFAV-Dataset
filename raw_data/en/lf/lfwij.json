These are specifically selected to facilitate your own body's healing in order to rebalance meridian disharmonies. According to East Asian medicine, meridians, also named channels, carry \"energy essence\", Qi, and vital nourishment, Blood. These flow within channels located all over the body and are associated with different organ systems that can become out of balance due to various reasons. They can become depleted, excessive, slowed, blocked, or impacted by various pathogenic influences, which may result in illness and disharmony of bodily and organs systems. To learn more, visit my [acupuncture medicine](/about-acupuncture-medicine) about page. Acupuncture practitioners work to reestablish the smooth flow of Qi and Blood along these meridians in order to bring balance to the body, mind, and spirit. Treatments are individualized and created according to the concerns discussed with your provider during your visit. A regular treatment may include a front and/or back body treatment, as well as ear, scalp, and/or facial acupuncture if determined necessary for your concerns discussed at the time of visit. When done by a licensed and experienced practitioner, acupuncture is generally safe for everyone, even babies and children (non-needle treatments are typically recommended for the little ones), as every treatment and protocol can be modified according to specific concerns discussed during your appointment. See my [conditions treated](/conditions-treated) about page to learn more about what acupuncture can treat. cupping therapy Glass, plastic, or silicone cups are used to create skin suction. This provides something similar to the inverse of a massage, where, instead of pushing down on tissues, the suction pulls them up. The cups may be left in place or moved on the skin. According to East Asian medicine principles, cupping therapy is able to move stagnation of blood to the surface of the skin, allowing for the proper flow of Qi and Blood to be restored to the area. This technique can be used to release muscle tension, relieve pain, reduce toxin load, promote better circulation, and improve immune function. Take into consideration that this modality, although not typically painful, may leave temporary skin discoloration, ranging from pink to dark purple (never done to leave marks on the face). food & lifestyle therapy East Asian medicine views food as medicine and lifestyle choices as a foundation of robust health. Its theory is deeply rooted in the energetic and therapeutic properties of ingredients and habits. Learn to understand the basic principles of East Asian medicine theory, how to choose foods and daily habits that will bring balance to your unique body, how to adapt your life to changing seasons, and which types of habits can benefit your personal health in different stages of your life. Nutritional and lifestyle recommendations are individualized according to your constitution, current East Asian medicine diagnosis, changing seasons, budget, and ingredient accessibility, all with a focus on sustainability and harmony of the whole person. herbal medicine therapy Herbal medicine is a potent and versatile form of treatment that may be used on its own or in combination with other modalities. It is based on the same guiding and prescribing principles as other East Asian medicine therapies. When prescribed, customized herbal formulas are created according to your discussed individual needs, medication prescriptions, budget, and personal preferences. With over 300 individual herbs and hundreds of time-tested formulas, your herbal prescription will be unique to your current concerns, and most likely modified at every visit according to changes experienced over the prescribing period. These may include Chinese, Ayurvedic and Western herbs, in either loose dried, powdered, encapsulated, or tinctured forms. And in some cases the recommendation of nutritional supplements. gua sha therapy Repeated gentle to vigorous skin scraping with a smooth-edged gua sha tool or ceramic spoon. This technique is used to break up stagnation and promote proper Qi and Blood flow. It can be used as a preventative or active condition treatment to release muscle tension, relieve pain, reduce toxin load, promote better circulation, and improve immune function. Take into consideration that this modality, although not typically painful, may leave temporary skin discoloration, ranging from pink to dark purple (never done to leave marks on the face). moxibustion (moxa) therapy The burning of the herb Ai Ye, Chinese mugwort, on selected acupuncture points to promote healing, bring warmth, relieve pain, and facilitate Qi and Blood flow. This technique is meant to warm specific points on the skin (direct moxa) or above the skin (indirect moxa), and for the heat to gently penetrate deeper into the area. The warming sensation of the area should be pleasant. Communication between the patient and practitioner is key to avoid burning or scarring of the skin. The acupuncturist will stay in the room with you throughout this therapy to ensure safety. This technique can be done with smokeless moxa or medicated herbal oils for those sensitive to smoke. massage therapy Hands-on manipulation of muscles and other soft tissues used to relieve pain, facilitate healing of injuries, improve blood and lymph circulation, relieve stress, and aid in general wellness. This may include Swedish, Myofascial Release, Tui Na, Muscle Energy Technique, Lymphatic Drainage, and Craniosacral Therapy, with or without aromatherapy, as advised for the individualized treatment.
