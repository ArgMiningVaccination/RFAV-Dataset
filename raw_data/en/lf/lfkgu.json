It focuses on laboratory-basedfacilities within acute hospitals (on-site or stand-alone)serving acute and primary care needs across apathology network. It also touches upon point-of-caretesting facilities in acute and primary care settings. It recommends that each laboratory space, whether ageneral or specialised laboratory or support laboratory,should be based on a standard module size in order to maximise the flexibility and adaptability of facilities. It supports a multidisciplinary approach to pathologyworking by categorising laboratory spaces based onfunction rather than discipline and encouragingdisciplines to share facilities wherever possible.

It covers laboratory-basedfacilities in acute hospitals (on-site or stand-alone) andpoint-of-care testing (POCT) facilities in acute andprimary care settings. 1.2In order to maximise capacity, efficiency and economies of scale it suggests that pathology services should be organised around pathology networks. 1.3'Modernising Pathology Services' (DH) sets out the steps that can be taken locally to develop pathology modernisation strategies, including setting up managedpathology networks. It also describes the actions thatwill be taken nationally to support developments. ThisHBN should be read in conjunction with this publication. 1.4This HBN adopts standard module sizes for both laboratory and POCT facilities in order to increase their flexibility in use. 1.5It replaces the existing HBN 15 - 'Accommodation for pathology services' (1991 edition).1.6This HBN does not cover mortuary and post- mortem room facilities. These are covered in HBN 20 - 'Facilities for mortuary and post-mortem room services' TOPICS COVERED Planning considerations 1.7This chapter deals with general planning considerations, including: the function of pathology services; the increased demand for pathology services; the network approach to pathology services; the modular approach to pathology services.1.8It also sets out other aspects of planning for pathology accommodation, such as upgrading or adapting existing buildings. General functional and design considerations1.9This chapter covers the broader issues that are relevant to the design of pathology accommodation.1.10 This chapter also addresses particular issues such as safety, security, finishes and IT.Specific functional and design considerations1.11 This chapter provides detailed design guidance for pathology facilities including the layout and planning of the specimen reception area, storage and supportspaces, associated offices, staff facilities and laboratoryrequirements, including: non-laboratory Chapters 5-8 provide detailed guidance about engineering services. Chapter 9 provides cost information. 31 IntroductionTHE FUNCTION OF PATHOLOGY SERVICES 2.1NHS pathology services should provide a high- quality, timely analytical and interpretative service to assist in clinical diagnosis, preventative medicine (forexample screening programmes), research, teachingand training, and epidemiological studies. 2.2Currently, 60-70% of diagnoses are based upon pathology. 2.3Specimens dealt with in acute general hospitals will arrive from a number of sources, including:w a r d s ; out-patients A&E community clinics; treatment centres (TCs);HBN 15 FACILITIES FOR PATHOLOGY SERVICES 42 Planning considerations Clinical science centre, Wythenshawe Hospital (Photo: Bob Collier) other hospitals/trusts; other pathology facilities; social services; dentists.2.4NHS pathology services also provide support for national screening programmes, public health, communicable disease surveillance, local authorityenvironmental services, and national medical researchprogrammes. 2.5The wide range of clinical services offered, and the variety of investigations available, in both number and type, must be taken into consideration when planningand designing pathology facilities. INCREASED DEMAND FOR PATHOLOGY SERVICES 2.6Demand for pathology services continues to grow year by year. There are several reasons for this, including the increase in demand for tests from theprimary care sector. 2.7Although traditionally most pathology services have been based within acute hospital trusts, an increasing number of tests are being requested by clinicians whoare managing patients in the primary care setting.Primary care diagnostic requests currently constitutearound 40% of the work performed in pathologydepartments. 2.8There has also been an increase in the demand for POCT facilities, not only on acute hospital sites but also in GP surgeries, out-patient clinics and TCs. This hasimplications for pathology services in terms ofcommunications systems and quality controlrequirements. 2.9As part of the 'NHS Plan', clinical guidelines have been published, for example for cancer networks. These have prompted an increase in the number ofspecimens requested from individual patients togetherwith an increase in the complexity of tests and for moredetailed reports. 2.10 New scientific and technological developments are leading to the expansion of clinical specialties and to an associated increased demand for pathology services. 2.11 Such developments, in particular the increase in the use of molecular diagnostic techniques, has led to an increase in the use of shared equipment acrosspathology disciplines and to the development of closer working relationships between pathology staff.Therefore, during the planning phase, considerationshould be given to the desirability of pathologydisciplines sharing laboratory facilities.CHALLENGES FACING THE PLANNING OF PATHOLOGY SERVICES 2.12 Particular challenges that will influence the planning and building of pathology accommodation in the future include: the advent of pathology networks in order to maximise capacity, efficiency and economies of scale; the need for standardised and sophisticated IT systems across pathology networks; the EU Working Time Directive, which will affect how and where pathology services are organised and delivered. NETWORK APPROACH TO PATHOLOGY SERVICES 2.13 When new pathology facilities are being planned, it is important to consider whether a network approach is appropriate to service needs and whether it would leadto improvements in the following: capacity; turnaround time; multidisciplinary working; service standardisation across the health community.2.14 There is no single preferred model for the organisation of pathology services. However, where a network is in place or is being developed, one approachcould be for a \"lead\" trust to lead/manage the serviceon behalf of other trusts. 2.15 An effective network should cover a \"natural\" health community. This community will need to be determined locally. It may be based on a strategic healthauthority (SHA) or part of it, or in some circumstances, anatural health community may cross SHA boundaries. 2.16 During the initial planning phase, the design team must consider whether it is more appropriate to use existing pathology facilities or to build new facilities inorder to provide the optimum level of service. It isunlikely that one facility will provide pathology servicesfor an entire network; a combination of pathologyaccommodation across different sites may serve anetwork more effectively. 2.17 Possible planning options may include a combination of the following: the provision of all pathology services on one site associated with an acute hospital trust and serving the needs of the whole pathology network includingother acute hospitals, TCs and primary care services;2 GENERAL SERVICE CONSIDERATIONS 5 the provision of pathology accommodation across several acute sites within a pathology network. Where there is sufficient demand, several facilitiesmight cater for urgent and emergency specimenssuch as haematology (including cross-matching) andchemical pathology, whereas routine, non-urgent andspecialist testing might only be justified on fewer sitesor even one site; the provision of \"standalone\" pathology facilities, not located on an acute hospital trust site but providing aservice for a pathology network covering severalacute hospitals, TCs, GP surgeries and primary caretrusts (PCTs). These facilities may cater for routine,non-urgent, and specialised investigations; the provision of smaller facilities for POCT within acute hospitals, TCs, and the primary care setting aspart of the service provided by a pathology network. MODULAR APPROACH TO PATHOLOGY SERVICES 2.18 Whatever combination of services is most appropriate, a flexible modular approach to planning, designing, and building pathology facilities can be used.The modular approach allows: each laboratory facility, whether it is a general laboratory, automated laboratory, specialised laboratory or POCT facility, to be based on astandard module size; each module to be scaled to accommodate the demand for investigations; each module to be scaled to accommodate the configuration and size of the equipment required; laboratories to adapt as technologies develop; pathology networks to respond to local requirements. EVALUATING SERVICE REQUIREMENTS 2.19 During the initial option appraisal and planning stages of pathology accommodation, all key stakeholders, including people commissioning work onbehalf of PCTs, should be consulted and involved inevaluating the service requirements. Establishing a goodrelationship, at the earliest stages of the project,between the different disciplines and user groupsinvolved will help problem-solving throughout theplanning and design process. 2.20 The key stakeholders should consider the range of diagnostic services required to support existing clinical services and planned developments within thepathology network. The pathology accommodation mustbe able to provide a fully adequate service for the acuteand non-acute sectors.2.21 The planning team must also take into account other clinical services such as cancer networks,preventative screening programmes and epidemiologicalstudies undertaken within the area, and anyrequirements for specialised pathology services. 1 2.22 Local planning teams should consult with laboratory clinicians to assess the range of pathologyinvestigations to be provided. There may be situationswhen a network does not provide certain types ofinvestigation, for example highly specialised tests onlycarried out in a small number of laboratories. LOCATING AND SIZING PATHOLOGY FACILITIES 2.23 Local circumstances will need to be taken into account during the planning stage, and will influencedecisions on the location and size of the facilities. These local circumstances may include the network'spopulation and size, staffing levels, current equipmentand existing facilities, the topography, and location ofservice users. 2.24 Any option appraisal must examine the advantages and disadvantages of the various planning proposals in relation to patients' needs and include a balancedassessment of all the major factors affecting capital andrevenue costs for each proposal. 2.25 Whatever the most appropriate planning option, all pathology facilities on any one site should be linked together in one complex to ensure that commonservices can be shared. OTHER PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS 2.26 Other planning considerations may include: the cost versus benefit of standardising IT systems across multiple sites to ensure efficient, effective,quality reporting; the cost versus benefit of standardising equipment across multiple sites; local traffic conditions and the necessity for an efficient transport system if specimens are to beanalysed at another site; travel distances and the importance of delivering certain specimens to the laboratory without delay toensure analytical and clinical validity; consideration of staff travelling time between departments; the availability of car parking or good local public transport systems;HBN 15 FACILITIES FOR PATHOLOGY SERVICES 61 'Guidance on Commissioning Arrangements for Specialised Services', DH the financial implications of providing efficient transportation of specimens to \"standalone\" facilities. This must be weighed against the costs ofduplication of equipment, accommodation, staff, andrunning costs. UPGRADING OR ADAPTATION OF EXISTING BUILDINGS 2.27 Before a decision is made to upgrade or adapt an existing building, consideration must be given to the long-term strategy for the service, the space required for the new service, and the size of the existing building.Regard must also be paid to the orientation and aspectof the building, and whether key requirements can bemet, for example the need for accommodation withsuitable access for large pieces of equipment andsufficient space for the location of all necessary supportservices. 2.28 If the most appropriate planning option is to upgrade or adapt existing facilities, the functional and physical condition of the building should be thoroughlyexamined. The assessment of the physical and otheraspects of existing buildings should include: availability of space for alterations and additions, including office space and staff facilities; type of construction; insulation; age of the buildings and condition of fabric, for example external and internal walls, floors, roofs, doors and windows, which may be determined by acondition survey; life expectancy and adequacy of engineering services, ease of access and facility for installation ofnew wiring, pipework and ducts, if required; the height of ceilings - high ceilings do not necessarily require installation of false ceilings, whichare costly and often impair natural ventilation; changes of floor level that may be hazardous; fire precautions; physical constraints to adaptation, such as load- bearing walls. 2.29 When comparing the cost of upgrading or adapting an existing building to that of a new building, due consideration should be given, in addition to the buildingcost, to the cost of relocating staff, demolition, salvagecosts, disruption of services in a phased project, andthe temporary effects on running costs of any impairedfunctioning of areas affected by upgrading. 2.30 The advice set out in this guidance essentially applies to new-build facilities. However, the principles are equally valid, and should be applied, when existingaccommodation is being upgraded or newaccommodation is being constructed within an existingbuilding that may previously have been used for otherpurposes. 72 GENERAL SERVICE CONSIDERATIONSCLINICAL PATHOLOGY ACCREDITATION 3.1 Consideration should be given to the criteria required for pathology laboratories to receive Clinical Pathology Accreditation (CPA). The key issue withregard to premises is that they should provide a workingenvironment in which staff can perform their requiredfunctions in accordance with national legislation andguidelines. See 'Standards for the Medical Laboratory',Clinical Pathology Accreditation UK, for details. FLEXIBILITY AND ADAPTABILITY 3.2 Like their research and teaching laboratory counterparts, routine NHS diagnostic laboratory facilitiesare increasingly subject to changing requirements. Thisis due to the rising use of automated testing equipmentand the trend towards multidisciplinary working. 3.3 The terms \"flexible\" and \"adaptable\" are often used interchangeably to describe accommodation that can respond to changing user needs. 3.4 A \"flexible\" design enables different activities to be accommodated in a given space without physical rearrangement taking place. 3.5 An \"adaptable\" design allows physical rearrangement of building elements, services and furniture. 3.6 When designing pathology facilities, consideration should be given to the need to allow for growth and change, irrespective of the scale of work and scientificdisciplines involved. To avoid being constrained by initialrequirements, a flexible and/or adaptable design shouldbe adopted. 3.7 The flexibility of pathology facilities depends on the provision of generic laboratory spaces that can accommodate a defined range of pathology functionswithin an essentially unchanging spatial and servicesframework. New needs and organisational changes aremet by moving people and their equipment. 3.8 With a flexible design, an assessment is made at the design stage of the widest range of work that may take place in the foreseeable future, and a generalised - butfixed - arrangement is made. 3.9 A flexible design may incorporate: modular repetitive bays of laboratories - each laboratory having a locally agreed standard pattern ofbenches and services; service outlets arranged in a regular grid or pattern, with service runs in floor ducts, above ceilings or invertical ducts. This will ensure that any work positionis able to make use of the full range of servicesprovided. 3.10 The adaptability of pathology facilities depends on the detailing, design and specification of building andservice elements, as well as furniture and equipment, so that the facilities may be conveniently and cost-effectively altered. 3.11 An adaptable design allows tailored accommodation for each changing need by making physical adjustment of the facilities. The way in whichthis is done will vary depending upon how easy it is tomake the adjustment. 3.12 An adaptable design may incorporate: removable partitions between laboratory spaces; laboratory furniture that can be added to, subtracted from, or rearranged as required. LABORATORY ACCOMMODATION - GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN AND LAYOUT Laboratory modules 3.13 Laboratories planned on a modular concept allow maximum flexibility and future adaptation as well as the standardisation of mechanical and electrical systems. 3.14 A pathology laboratory may be based on a 3.3 m x 9.9 m module (as shown in Figure 3.1). The minimum module size should be the 13module. Modules may be added together to accommodate a range of facilitiesfrom individual support laboratories to generallaboratories. 3.15 The module width may vary from 3.0 m to 3.6 m. Reference should be made to BS EN 14056 to determine the correct aisle width between benches.Consideration should also be given to the bench depthHBN 15 FACILITIES FOR PATHOLOGY SERVICES 83 General functional and design considerations(between 750 and 900 mm) and the wall construction between rooms. 3.16 The number of modules required and their final configuration should be determined by pathology users based on workload and type of work carried out. Entry to the laboratory3.17 A lobby at each laboratory exit should form the boundary between the laboratory and non-laboratory space. This will allow for the hygienic, safe and securepassage of users between non-laboratory andlaboratory spaces. 3.18 Clinical hand-washing facilities and coat pegs for hanging laboratory protective clothing should be provided in the lobby, together with colour-coded linenbags for storing dirty protective clothing. Safety3.19 In order to arrive at a satisfactory and economical design solution that will minimise the risks from potential hazards, users should be consulted at an early stage ofthe project. 3.20 The design and layout of the facilities is important in encouraging safe working practices. Guidance on design features that contribute to safety (for examplehand-washing facilities, fittings, finishes and furniture,storage of chemicals etc) is given in Chapter 4.3.21 Special equipment such as exhaust protective cabinets and fume cupboards will be required (seeChapter 6 for further details). See also fire precautions inthe 'Firecode' suite of documents. 3.22 Provision should be made for the storage of, and easy access to, first-aid products, chemical poison antidotes and eye-care items. 3.23 See Appendix 9 for guidance on fire safety. Infection control3.24 Pathology facilities should be designed for easy, frequent and thorough cleaning. The number and design of waste bins need careful consideration. 3.25 The number and location of clinical hand-wash basins should be decided by the infection control team in conjunction with clinical staff. Alcohol hand-rubdispensers should be provided. Space should also beprovided for sharps bins to allow sharps to be discardedat point of use. Containment level 3.26 All laboratories in which routine pathology work is conducted should be at a minimum of containment level 2. 3.27 For microbiology work, separate laboratories at containment level 3 are required if work is to be carried out on hazard group 3 organisms and specimens.Pathologists will require access to containment level 33 GENERAL FUNCTIONAL AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 9Single module 33 m21/3 module 11 m 2 2/3 module 22 m2Double module 66 m 2 = 3300 mm Figure 3.1 Laboratory modulesaccommodation as the need arises (see paragraphs 4.167-4.169 and paragraphs 7.3-7.11 for furtherdetails). 3.28 See Appendix 9 for 'Regulations and guidance relating to containment laboratories'.Security 3.29 Pathology facilities contain equipment and other items that are both valuable and vulnerable; access should therefore be restricted to authorised personnelonly (this is a requirement of CPA). This should beattained by the use of security measures, for exampleswipe cards or locks to control entry. 3.30 Good security is also essential due to the serious danger presented to unauthorised persons from exposure to potential hazards in laboratories. 3.31 The entire laboratory area should be planned as a secure area, with all entrances capable of being controlled in accordance with the security policy of the whole hospital. Where microbiological cultures arepresent, reference should be made to the Anti-Terrorism,Crime and Security Act 2001. 3.32 Security arrangements should provide for staff safety out-of-hours, due to many pathology services operating 24 hours a day, seven days per week. The\"mastering\" of keys and their availability outside normalworking hours are matters for local decision. FINISHES, FITTINGS AND EQUIPMENT Benching 3.33 Bench surfaces should be easily cleanable, resistant to acids, alkalis, solvents and disinfectants (in normal use), and impervious to water. Ideally, theyshould be made of a solid plastic laminate or epoxy, andnot scribed directly to a wall but to an up-stand or backplate. 3.34 The colour of work surfaces should provide a suitable background without creating any problems of glare. For further information see HTM 67 - 'Laboratoryfitting-out systems'. 3.35 All benches should have minimal joints and seams, but where these are necessary (for example where benches meet, between bench and up-stand, aroundsinks, taps, sockets, shelf supports etc) they should besealed with non-shrinking sealant such as two-partepoxy grout. No open holes should be allowed for thefeeding of cables etc. 3.36 Reference should be made to BS EN 13150.Flooring 3.37 Floor coverings should be appropriate to functional use and contribute towards the creation of an attractive environment, but should not present a hazard todisabled people or the movement of wheeledequipment. Patterning should not producedisorientation. 3.38 Floor surfaces should be easily cleanable, resistant to acids, alkalis, solvents and disinfectants (in normal use), and impervious to water. They should be smoothand slip-resistant. Floors should only be non-slip (ratherthan slip-resistant) where specific conditions require this,for example in wet areas. 3.39 Joints in the flooring material should be kept to a minimum and sealed by hot welding. At wall junctions, the flooring should be coved to walls and sealed (a sit-on coved skirting is not acceptable). Sinks 3.40 General laboratory sinks should be \"all-in-one\" units to avoid the need for sealing around the sink. They should be epoxy or stainless steel and should draindirectly to the waste via a simple S-bend trap. 3.41 A dedicated sink is required when liquid radioactive or clinical waste is disposed of by dilution. 3.42 A sluice will also be required where urine samples are handled. Clinical hand-wash basins 3.43 Wall-mounted paper towel and soap dispensers should be provided at each clinical hand-wash basin. 3.44 Taps should be lever-, knee- or automatic sensor- operated. 3.45 Eyewash stations should be provided adjacent to clinical hand-wash basins. Ideally, these should double up as emergency shower hoses. Emergency showers 3.46 An emergency shower should be provided in a lobby or corridor adjacent to any work area in which there is a risk of severe chemical contamination. Itshould provide an immediate high-volume output ofwater. Floor drainage needs to be provided. Laboratory furniture 3.47 Laboratory furniture should demonstrate good ergonomic design and must be compliant with BS EN 14056.HBN 15 FACILITIES FOR PATHOLOGY SERVICES 10Pathology equipment 3.48 The In Vitro Diagnostics Directive covers much of the equipment used in pathology laboratories. When planning and designing a laboratory that will house in-vitro medical devices, instructions provided by themanufacturer, particularly regarding installation and sitespecifications, should be followed. 3.49 Reference should be made to 'Management of In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices' (Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency). INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 3.50 Pathology facilities require modern IT systems capable of supporting rapid information transfer andproviding a remote service. The system should meet theneeds of pathology providers and users. It should alsobe capable of transferring information across multiplesites including acute hospital sites, \"standalone\"pathology facilities, GP surgeries, TCs and POCTfacilities, and between laboratory networks. 3.51 During the initial planning phase, consideration should be given to the provision of adequate computerterminals within laboratories and associated offices.Separate accommodation for network services forlaboratory information management systems may berequired. Other issues that should be addressedinclude: system integration and standardisation; automated test ordering and results delivery; data protection and confidentiality. 3.52 Any new or upgraded IT system should be designed in conjunction with the guidance given on pathology information systems by the NHS InformationAuthority (NHSIA) and the National Accreditation andProcurement Process Service (NAPPS).3 GENERAL FUNCTIONAL AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 11 Clinical science building 2, Manchester Royal InfirmaryCENTRAL SPECIMEN RECEPTION AND HANDLING 4.1 Ideally, there should be a single specimen reception area on each pathology site, which should process all test requests and distribute samples to the appropriatelaboratory. It should have a direct and secureconnection to the outside in order to receive externalsamples via post or courier. 4.2 Internal samples should, where appropriate, be transported via pneumatic air tube transport systems. These provide a viable and rapid alternative to portersfor moving specimens. Adequate contingency plansshould be available in the advent of a breakdown of theair tube system. 4.3 For further information on pneumatic air transport systems see HTM 2009 - 'Pneumatic air tube transport systems'. 4.4 The specimen reception area should comprise a reception room with a reception hatch - with a fixed counter and secure hatch doors. This will allowspecimens not transported by pneumatic air tube to bedeposited. 4.5 The counter surface should be easy to clean, impervious to water and resistant to disinfectants. 4.6 Immediately adjacent to the reception area, a specimen sorting area for processing request forms and producing labels should be provided. This area requiresa number of workstations, each comprising a desktopPC, appropriate-sized desk, adjustable-height officechair and appropriate lighting for computer use. Theoffice chair should have an impervious covering. 4.7 Adjacent to the specimen sorting area, a separate specimen processing area should be provided for centrifuging, aliquoting, and dispatching samples to theappropriate laboratory. 4.8 The specimen processing area will require space for centrifuges, a laboratory sink, a refrigerator/freezer and, possibly, a microbiological safety cabinet (seeparagraphs 7.21-7.28 for further guidance onmicrobiological safety cabinets). Bench working spacewill be required for paperwork and packing samplesprior to despatch to laboratories. Storage for small itemsof laboratory equipment and hand-washing facilities willalso be required. Appropriate cooling to match the heatgain should be allowed. 4.9 Facilities should be provided for the reception of specimens contaminated with radioactive materials or highly infectious specimens. Facilities should also beprovided for the decontamination of staff. Storage willbe required for equipment and protective clothing. 4.10 The specimen processing area should be constructed to a suitable acoustical standard to reduce the effect of noisy equipment (for example centrifuges)on neighbouring users as well as users of the spaceitself. 4.11 Ideally, this area should be directly connected to the laboratories receiving samples (for example via a hole in the wall) to avoid any sample holding. 4.12 The use of communications systems (for example e-ordering and electronic patient records) should be considered. These allow specimen details and testrequests to be entered into computers directly linked tothe appropriate analytical instruments, which in turn willreduce transcription error (labelling, sorting, aliquoting,order entry etc). Out-of-hours facility4.13 Provision for holding specimens and blood cultures taken outside normal working hours and cross-matched blood (at 4\u00baC, room temperature and 37\u00baC) should beavailable. This facility should be accessible without theneed to enter laboratory areas. OFFICES 4.14 All office areas should be sited outside the laboratory zones. Offices opening off laboratory areasare not acceptable. Administration office 4.15 Normally, all reports of pathological examinations conducted on one site will be dispatched through a central administrative office. Reports received from thelaboratories will be entered into the computer system,printed and posted.

Single-person offices 4.17 Single-person offices, which are sufficiently private for confidential discussions between staff, will be required for senior clinicians and managers. Two typesof office will be needed: 1. Type A - This office is for administrative duties. It should accommodate an office workstation with monitor and keyboard, seating for up to three otherpeople, and storage for books and files. 2. Type B - This office is the same as type A but with additional space for a bench for the microscopicexamination of slides. Multi-person staff offices 4.18 Multi-person offices are required for secretarial, administrative and other desk-based work. Each secretarial workstation should have a desk with amonitor and keyboard. The position of all displayequipment, and the design and type of desk and chair,should comply with relevant guidelines on ergonomicsand lighting. 4.19 Space should be provided for holding files, limited quantities of stationery and office supplies, and for hanging coats. 4.20 All offices for laboratory and support staff should have easy access to the laboratories. The types of office will be determined once service needs have beenidentified. The local project team will establish thenumber of offices required. STAFF ACCOMMODATION 4.21 The provision of well-designed and appropriate staff facilities is very important to the functioning of apathology service and essential for compliance with CPArequirements. 4.22 Facilities should include: staff changing and shower facilities, including toilets and secure storage for personal effects; protective clothing storage; a rest room; kitchen and vending facilities; education and training facilities. Staff changing and shower facilities 4.23 Provision should be made for separate male and female changing facilities, including secure full-length lockers for holding outdoor clothing and personalpossessions. Access to changing areas should be viadoors with close-proximity card facilities or a similarsecurity system. 4.24 The number of changing spaces and lockers should reflect the number of full-time and part-time staff, including trainees and students. 4.25 Separate male and female shower facilities should be provided. 4.26 Changing areas should be equipped with mirrors, hair dryers and shaving points.4.27 Separate male and female WCs, and an accessible WC, should be provided. Each WC should comprise a self-contained room to provide maximum privacy;cubicles are not acceptable. For guidance on theappropriate number of male and female WCs see theWorkplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations1992. Protective clothing storage 4.28 A clean linen store should be sited adjacent to the changing facilities for issuing clean protective clothing (that is, white coats). Rest room 4.29 A rest room is required where staff can relax and consume beverages and snacks. The room should have windows with a pleasant outlook, providing naturallighting and ventilation. 4.30 The room should contain comfortable seating and low tables. A dining table and chairs should also be provided to enable staff to eat and drink in comfort. 4.31 Where a TV or music system is available in the room, a separate \"quiet\" area should be provided for staff wishing to read or talk. 4.32 The room should have direct access to a small kitchen. Kitchen and vending facilities 4.33 Kitchen facilities are required for preparing beverages and light snacks, washing and storing crockery and cutlery, and storing limited quantities of drygoods and refrigerated items. 4.34 Fittings and equipment should include a stainless steel sink and drainer, kettle, microwave cooker, worktop with cupboards, automatic dishwasher and aclinical hand-wash basin. HBN 15 FACILITIES FOR PATHOLOGY SERVICES 144.35 A vending machine alcove should be provided adjacent to the kitchen with access from the rest room to accommodate drink and snack vending machines. Education and training facilities 4.36 Facilities should include a seminar room and a library. All staff will need access to IT facilities. 4.37 The seminar room is required for teaching, tutorials and meetings. Furniture and equipment should include upright stacking chairs with writing arms, a wall-mounted whiteboard, an imaging viewer, a video/TVmonitor and a computer and keyboard. 4.38 A computer image projector is required. A retractable ceiling-mounted screen should be provided, with efficient blackout curtains and facilities forprojection of slides and overhead transparencies. 4.39 A separate library room is required that can satisfy the CPA requirement for a quiet room for private study.The library should have adequate storage for books and technical journals, and computer terminals with internetaccess. NON-LABORATORY SUPPORT SPACES 4.40 Non-laboratory support spaces will be required to store supplies, service equipment and deal with waste.These may be shared by all pathology disciplines. It is aCPA requirement that there are separate storagefacilities for the following: process and quality records; clinical material; blood and blood products; hazardous substances; drugs, vaccines and other therapeutics; reagents.4 SPECIFIC FUNCTIONAL AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 15 Cytopathology screening laboratory (left) and automated laboratories (housinghaematology and chemical pathology)(below) at Manchester Royal InfirmaryEquipment service room 4.41 Facilities are required for equipment servicing and the storage of spare parts (as defined in equipment manufacturers' user manuals, supplemented by anyformally agreed local instructions). Local instructionsmay require the provision of additional facilities. 4.42 Electronics and medical engineering technicians carrying out minor scheduled or unscheduled servicing will use this room. 4.43 Space provision should be sufficient to park and manoeuvre equipment and accommodate a workbench with integral lockable cupboards. There should besufficient socket-outlets protected by residual A clinical hand-wash basin should beprovided. 4.44 Manufacturers' user manuals should be kept in this room. 4.45 Medical gas outlets should supply oxygen, compressed air and vacuum. 4.46 Some items of equipment may require decontamination prior to servicing. Local policy will identify how and where this is undertaken. Equipment and supplies store 4.47 Bulk supplies and small items of equipment should be held in a central lockable laboratory store. A mobile racking system will maximise the available space. Anarea for storekeeping and material handling activitiesshould be allowed. 4.48 Non-flammable laboratory chemicals should be stored together - in a poisons cabinet, if appropriate. 4.49 A \"just in time\" system, which uses a barcode system to top up supplies on a regular basis, will minimise the quantity of supplies needed to be stored. HBN 15 FACILITIES FOR PATHOLOGY SERVICES 16 Clinical science centre at Wythenshawe Hospital (above; Photo: Bob Collier);automated laboratories (housinghaematology and chemical pathology atManchester Royal Infirmary (right) External gas bottle storage area 4.50 A vented weatherproof store will be necessary to accommodate a range of gas cylinders. A secure store, separate from the main building, may be required for thestorage of hydrogen cylinders. External flammable goods store 4.51 The main stock of flammable materials used in pathology should be stored in a vented, secure, external flammable goods store that is easily accessible from thelaboratories. It may be grouped with other flammablegoods stores to share vehicle access. 4.52 Day-to-day supplies of flammable materials should be stored in flameproof cabinets in each laboratory area. Advice on the storage of flammable materials can befound in 'Firecode'. 4.53 Histopathology laboratories, in particular, use absolute ethanol; external stores that are used for this solvent have to be licensed by HM Customs and Excise. Waste handling and disposal holding area 4.54 Secure facilities for the temporary holding of packed refuse should be provided. Disposal of laboratory waste, and the identification of waste bycolour coding, will depend on whole-hospital policy. Thesize of the disposal hold should be determined by thefrequency of collection. 4.55 A convenient and safe route should be provided from the decontamination and media preparation suite (see paragraphs 4.116-4.126) to the holding area. Housekeeping room 4.56 Where pathology facilities are split over more than one floor, each floor should have one housekeeping room. 4.57 The room should provide easy access to cleaning equipment and materials, and adequate space for manoeuvring machines, emptying and filling of buckets,and the routine servicing and cleaning of equipment. 4.58 There should be unrestricted access to the sink, which should be supplied with hot and cold water, and to a clinical hand-wash basin. The room should be welllit and ventilated so that equipment can dry quickly. Chemical store - preparation area 4.59 A chemical store will be required for the storage of reagents and solutions, flammable and toxic chemicals, and strong acids and bases. It is important that thevarious classes of chemical (for example flammables,oxidising agents, acids and bases) are stored inseparate areas within this room. 4.60 A flammable liquids cabinet and a poisons cabinet should be provided. The poisons cabinet will need to bein a separate secure room and may require a HomeOffice licence. A fume cupboard will also be required(see paragraphs 7.29-7.41 for further details). 4.61 This room will also be used for weighing and preparing reagents for use in the laboratory areas. Provision should be made for storing glassware andother equipment. There should be adequate benchingfor both working, and holding balances, mixers, stirrers,a hot plate and a hot air oven. A sink and refrigeratorwill be required. A glass wash facility should beassociated with the chemical storage and preparationarea. 4.62 Facilities for holding and storing protective clothing, and for hand-washing, should be available. AUTOMATED LABORATORIES 4.63 The increased automation of pathology tests has led to a demand for open-plan laboratories that can accommodate free-standing analytical equipment. Eachlaboratory should be modular in nature and sized toaccommodate the analytical equipment required (seeparagraphs 3.13-3.16 for details of laboratory modules). 4.64 A range of automated equipment is available for performing tests in chemical pathology, haematology, microbiology, immunology and virology. 4.65 Automated tests for chemical pathology and haematology (together with limited tests for immunology and viral serology) can currently be carried out on thesame equipment. Further integration of tests fromdifferent disciplines onto one platform may take place inthe future. 4.66 See Appendix 1 for typical workflow and tests in haematology and Appendix 2 for typical workflow and tests in chemical pathology. 4.67 Most existing equipment incorporates dedicated data processing systems linked to laboratory information management systems (LIMS). 4.68 There is evidence that future equipment will be more compact, modular and versatile.4.69 Automated laboratories should be open-plan, with minimal or preferably no internal column structure to enable a good line of sight. A central open floor shouldbe provided to allow optimal configuration of analyserswith access from all sides. 4.70 The laboratory should be as close as possible to the specimen reception area, preferably connected; consideration should be given to installing a conveyorbelt to transfer samples from the specimen receptionarea directly to the analysers. 4 SPECIFIC FUNCTIONAL AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 174.71 If such a close arrangement is not possible, the use of a pneumatic air system may be required - in which case bench space will be needed in thelaboratory for receiving specimens. 4.72 Fixed laboratory benching may not be required in the centre of the laboratory (where blood cell counters and other analysers are located), but perimeter benchingwill be needed to accommodate small bench-topanalysers and microscopes. The microscope areashould be quiet to allow undisturbed examination ofstained slides. 4.73 Automated laboratories should be designed with adaptability in mind. The ability to install new pieces of equipment in the central area (to supplement what isalready installed) and/or change the layout of theanalysers is important. 4.74 Engineering services should also be designed to allow for such adaptation - not only in terms of service connections, but also to deal with changing heat outputand electrical supply and drainage needs as newmodules of equipment are added or removed. 4.75 The design should allow for any future increase in the demand for engineering services. Consideration should be given to providing a drop-down distributionsystem from the ceiling level in order to supplyadditional IT cabling. 4.76 Most analysers require under-floor services in the form of drainage connections, and overhead services in the form of power and data connections. Overheadservices should be provided via a services wing directlyabove the equipment. 4.77 Cupboards and refrigerators will be required for storing \"in-use\" reagent solutions in small and large volumes. Storage should also be provided fordisposables and small, miscellaneous items ofequipment. 4.78 Specimens and reagents will need to be held under refrigerated or deep-freeze conditions. This requirement can be met by the provision of an adjacentsupport laboratory for refrigerators and freezers and a+4\u00baC cold room. 4.79 Adjustable shelving should be provided in the cold room for holding various types of tube, bottle, rack and basket. 4.80 Figure 4.2 shows a possible layout of an open-plan automated laboratory, plus adjacent support laboratories and a specialised laboratory (based on modules given inFigure 3.1).HBN 15 FACILITIES FOR PATHOLOGY SERVICES 18Figure 4.2 Possible layout of open-plan automated laboratory and support laboratories (see schedules of accommodation for indicative areas for individual laboratories)Specialised lab Support lab = 3300 mmSupport lab Support lab Support labSupport labOpen-plan lab for automated free-standing equipmentFootprint of robotic equipmentGENERAL LABORATORIES 4.81 General laboratories may be used across a range of disciplines. It is important to design each laboratory to support the requirements of the particular functionthat it will house. However, in order to allow futureflexibility the design should be as generic as possible. 4.82 Such laboratories are currently used for general microbiology (see Appendix 3) and general histopathology work (see paragraphs 4.218-4.225). 4.83 A general laboratory can vary from a single standalone module to several double modules (see Figure 3.1). 4.84 Fixed benching with above-bench shelving and cupboards and below-bench cupboards should be provided. A sink should be provided for every two tothree modules, and a clinical hand-wash basin for eachlaboratory area. An area for floor-standing equipmentshould also be provided. Engineering services to atypical laboratory module are discussed in chapters 5-8. 4.85 Figures 4.3 and 4.4 show possible models of general laboratories, plus adjacent support laboratories and specialised laboratories (based on modules given inFigure 3.1). Microbiology laboratories 4.86 Where general laboratories are used for microbiology work, space will be required for the reception of specimens from the main specimenreception area before despatch to the appropriateworkstation in the laboratory. 4.87 Some microbiological laboratories will require a separate reception area for the examination of food, water and environmental samples. This is specified bythe accreditation scheme for such tests operated by theUnited Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS). 4.88 Bacteriology work is normally undertaken at allotted workstations based on specimen type, for example urines, wounds and other swabs, genito-urinary specimens, faeces etc. One or two persons may operate at any workstation. 4.89 Space will be required for bench and free-standing equipment, and to allow for bench activities (see Appendix 3 for further details). 4.90 Storage may be required for standard commercial media formulations, which are stored in a dried state and prepared as required. Alternatively, ready-to-useproducts can be bought in at a higher cost. 4.91 Centrifuges will be required. These create noise and vibration problems and may interfere with other operations, for example the use of microscopes.Consideration should be given to housing these facilitiesin a dedicated support laboratory (see paragraphs4.112-4.113 for further details). 4.92 Facilities will be required for staining slides and microscopy work, including fluorescence microscopy. As benches used for microscopy work should be free fromvibration, this work should be carried out on a dedicatedbench. An additional microscope will be required at theurine examination workstation. 4.93 Inoculated media should be incubated under highly controlled temperature and atmospheric conditions, for example aerobically, anaerobically or in carbon dioxideatmospheres, to obtain growth of organisms. 4.94 Access to a hot room maintained at 37\u00baC, and use of separate incubators, will therefore be necessary. Anaerobic isolation of organisms may require the use ofspecial equipment with space and service implications,for example an anaerobic chamber. 4.95 Cell culture work will take place in a specialised cell culture laboratory (see paragraphs 4.143-4.144 for details). 4.96 A category 3 facility will be needed if samples from patients with SARS or TB are to be tested. This is due to the risk of infection to the operator when processingsamples that may contain hazard group 3 micro-organisms. For guidance on the design of category 3facilities, see paragraphs 4.167-4.169. SUPPORT LABORATORIES 4.97 These accommodate functions directly supporting automated, general and specialised laboratories. Notesting is carried out in support laboratories, whichinclude equipment rooms, instrument rooms andpreparation rooms. 4.98 They should comprise a central aisle with work areas on each side to accommodate free-standing or bench-mounted equipment. 4.99 A support laboratory can vary from a 13module to a double module (see Figure 3.1). 4.100 Figures 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 show possible layouts of support laboratories, of varying size, opening onto open-plan laboratories (automated and general). 4.101 Support laboratories may include the following: Common equipment rooms4.102 Common equipment rooms should house a mixture of laboratory equipment in common use by the testing laboratories. They should be carefully situated to support the main laboratories and designed with a4 SPECIFIC FUNCTIONAL AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 19mixture of wall benching for bench-mounted equipment and areas for floor-standing equipment. 4.103 Careful attention should be paid to the heat loads generated by the mixture of equipment likely to be in the room. Cold room (+4\u00baC) 4.104 Cold rooms are needed by a number of pathology disciplines for storing specimens and reagents requiringrefrigeration. These rooms should be maintained at +4\u00baC. Floor drainage will be required. Adjustableshelving should be provided for holding various types oftube, bottle, rack and basket. Cold rooms should besited within easy reach of their main users. Cryo-preservation room 4.105 A cryo-preservation room may be required to accommodate liquid nitrogen freezers, which come in a range of sizes. The freezers may be refilled via portableHBN 15 FACILITIES FOR PATHOLOGY SERVICES 20LobbySpecialised lab Open-plan general lab Support lab Support lab Support lab Support labSpecialised lab = 3300 mm Open-plan general lab Support lab Support lab Support lab Support labSpecialised lab = 3300 mmSupport labFigure 4.3 Possible layout of open-plan general laboratory and support laboratories (see schedules of accommodation for indicative areas for individual laboratories) Figure 4.4 Possible layout of open-plan general laboratory and support laboratories (see schedules of accommodation for indicative areas for individual laboratories)dewars or a piped liquid nitrogen system from an external large-capacity tank. Facilities will need to takeaccount of this. 4.106 Storage will be required for face shields, cryogenic gloves and aprons. 4.107 Liquid nitrogen can damage flooring. Disposable (moveable) rubber matting should be considered as a second layer of flooring within the room to protect themain floor finish. 4.108 See Chapter 6 for information on ventilation. 37\u00baC room 4.109 A hot room (at 37\u00baC) may be required for incubating cultures. Adjustable shelving should be provided for holding tubes, bottles, racks and baskets. Darkroom 4.110 A darkroom may be required for visualising DNA under UV light and will be needed for fluorescence microscopy, for example for immunology. The roomshould be fitted out with laboratory benching, under-bench storage and over-bench shelving, and shouldinclude a laboratory sink. 4.111 A specialist revolving darkroom door will be required to avoid leakage of light into the room.Centrifuge room 4.112 If compatible with laboratory operations, centrifuges should be housed in a single room due to the noise and heat gain of this equipment. The roommay need to contain bench-top and floor-standingcentrifuges. 4.113 Above-bench shelving and under-bench storage units may be required for the storage of rotors. Refrigerator/freezer storage room 4.114 Refrigerators and freezers should be located in one room due to the high heat gain of this equipment. A combination of +4\u00baC, -18\u00baC and -80\u00baC equipmentmay be accommodated in this room. Shelving will berequired. Laboratory stores 4.115 Stores for working stocks of materials and equipment will be required. They should be easily accessible from the relevant laboratory areas. Decontamination and media preparation suite 4.116 A decontamination and media suite may be required for production of in-house bacteriological culture media. Space requirements should be discussedand agreed with the pathology team during the earlyplanning stage, since procedures for media preparationare changing and increasingly media is bought in.4 SPECIFIC FUNCTIONAL AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 21 Clinical science centre, Wythenshawe Hospital (Photo: Bob Collier)4.117 The suite should comprise: central wash-up and sterilizing area; media preparation room; plate pouring/media dispensing room.4.118 Each room should be based on the standard laboratory modules (see Figure 3.1). See Figures 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 for possible layouts of support laboratories. 4.119 The central wash-up and sterilizing area should have direct access to the media preparation room, which in turn should have direct access to the platepouring/media dispensing room. Central wash-up and sterilizing area 4.120 The central wash-up and sterilizing area may need to use demineralised water for media preparation. It will need to house autoclaves and hot-air ovens.Equipment for producing demineralised water may belocated in the wash-up area or provided as part of thecentral plant installation. 4.121 Very efficient ventilation is essential in this area, as unpleasant smells and considerable heat can be generated. Air-cooling may be necessary to maintainoptimal working conditions. 4.122 Space will be required in the central wash-up and sterilizing area for: disinfection of contaminated material before disposal, and of glass and plastics prior to cleaning or disposal; disposal of solid and liquid waste; washing glassware by automatic machines or manually, including specialised glassware; capping cleansed tubes and containers and subsequent sterilization; storing sterilized items and materials; sterilizing bulk media in laboratory autoclaves; drying glassware in drying cabinets and sterilizing by dry heat. Media preparation room 4.123 Where media is produced on the premises, a media preparation room will be required for: preparing solid and liquid media in bulk; storing bulk materials such as dried media preparations on open shelves or under refrigerated conditions; filling of sterilized containers with prepared liquid media (using either manual or automated methods); storing miscellaneous laboratory containers, tubes and caps, consumables and disposable items, labelsand sundry items of minor equipment. Plate pouring/media dispensing room 4.124 The process of media preparation tends to disperse fine dust into the atmosphere; plate pouring should therefore take place in a separate area. 4.125 The plate pouring/media dispensing room will require a laminar flow cabinet if plate pouring is undertaken manually. Otherwise, equipment will berequired to do this - some of which can sterilize, pourand stack plates. Bench space will be required forlabelling prepared media, tubes and bottles. 4.126 See Appendices 4 and 5 for workflow through the decontamination and media preparation suite. SPECIALISED LABORATORIES 4.127 Each pathology discipline currently has its own specialised tests (and techniques). For some smaller disciplines, for example immunology, histocompatibilityand immunogenetics, most of the tests are specialised. 4.128 A specialised test is one that is extremely difficult to perform, is rarely requested or is a new and emerging test. As technology develops or clinical needs change,certain investigations may move from the \"specialised\"category; it may then be appropriate for the test to beperformed as part of a routine repertoire in a moregeneral laboratory environment. 4.129 It may be possible for different tests to share the same laboratory space (as is the case with mass spectrometry and chromatography testing), and thisshould be explored with user groups. 4.130 Specialised laboratories should be designed as generically as possible to allow for future flexibility. Each laboratory will require space for specialised testingequipment, which may be bench-top mounted or floor-mounted. 4.131 Bench space will be required for receiving specimens from the main specimen reception area. Further space may be required for preparing samplesprior to testing and recording results. 4.132 Specimens and reagents will need to be held in refrigerated or deep freeze conditions in adjacent support laboratories. 4.133 All specialised laboratories require hand-washing facilities close to exits, coat pegs (for hanging protectiveHBN 15 FACILITIES FOR PATHOLOGY SERVICES 22clothing), and an area for storing linen bags (for discarded dirty protective clothing). 4.134 A specialised laboratory can vary from a 13 module to several double modules depending on the quantity of tests, equipment and staff. 4.135 They should comprise a central aisle with work areas on each side to accommodate free-standing or bench-mounted equipment. 4.136 Figures 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 show possible layouts of specialised laboratories, opening onto open-plan laboratories (automated and general). 4.137 Specialised laboratories may include, but are not limited to the following:Immunoassay testing4.138 An immunoassay involves the analysis of body fluids to monitor hormone imbalances (associated with thyroid and reproductive functions) and cancer andother tumour markers. There are an increasing numberof other applications, for example screening for drugs ofabuse and infectious diseases. 4.139 Many immunoassay tests take place in automated laboratories, but some need to be carried out in specialised laboratories, for example if levelradioisotopes and/or flammable solvents are used. 4.140 Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are often performed on automated equipment. The capacity of such equipment and diversity ofmanufacturers supplying reagents and equipment meanthat within any pathology facility several instruments willbe needed. Allergy testing is currently carried out onspecific semi-automated equipment. ELISAs may becarried out in a specialised or automated laboratory. Chromatography testing 4.141 Some pathology centres may undertake chromatography testing as part of their chemical pathology, toxicology and haematology programmes.Gas liquid chromatography (GLC) and thin layerchromatography (TLC) cannot be accommodated in general laboratories due to the environmentalrequirements. High-pressure liquid chromatographyinvolves the use of a self-contained instrument, whichmay be located in a general laboratory. 4.142 Chromatography equipment tends to be bench- top mounted and controlled by an adjacent computer. Equipment for undertaking GLC and TLC may requirededicated ventilation and piped gases such as helium.Attention to the operating environment is important.Manufacturer information should be sought at an early stage of the design process to determine theappropriate temperature and humidity of the laboratoryas well as the acceptable particulate matter level andsensitivity of the equipment to vibration. Cell and tissue cultivation 4.143 A cell culture laboratory for the cultivation of cells and tissues may be required if genetics and virology testing is planned. Class II safety cabinets will berequired. 4.144 Each laboratory should accommodate a bench- mounted microscope, under-bench fridge and freezer, bench-mounted centrifuge, a floor-standing incubatorand a sink. Mass spectroscopy 4.145 A mass spectroscopy (MS) laboratory may be required if testing for steroids, immunosuppressive drugs and poisons. 4.146 Mass spectroscopy equipment tends to be bench-mounted with an accompanying computer workstation. However, larger equipment is available that is floor-mounted. All types may require dedicatedventilation above the equipment to vent toxic vapours,ozone and heat. The weight and size of the equipmentshould be taken into account when specifying laboratoryfurniture. 4.147 All MS tests require gas supplies, typically argon and oxygen. The type and nature of gases required are dependent on the individual equipment and test, andshould be carefully checked at the planning stages. Trace metal testing4.148 If testing for trace metals is planned, an atomic absorption laboratory may be required.4.149 The laboratory should have a dust-free, low- humidity atmosphere. Usually the equipment is not located near windows, doors or any other area wheredrafts may cause unstable thermal conditions. 4.150 Atomic absorption (AA) equipment is usually located on a workbench. The workbench must be free from vibration, and stable and strong enough to supportthe weight of the equipment. It should be large enoughto permit the free circulation of air around theinstrument. 4.151 Since the AA equipment emits fumes and vapours, it must be located under a flue that is vented by an exhaust fan and ducted to an external vent.Ducting must be corrosion-resistant and fireproof. 4.152 Piped gases will be required to the AA equipment; the type and volume will depend on the4 SPECIFIC FUNCTIONAL AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 23individual requirements of the test and the manufacturer of the equipment. Polymerase chain reaction 4.153 Molecular biology techniques are used increasingly in pathology. These techniques may be used in virology testing programmes as well asmolecular diagnostics and genetics. A key technique isthe polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which involvestaking small quantities of a DNA molecule and creatingmillions of copies of it. 4.154 Due to the extreme sensitivity of PCR, any contamination can cause widespread problems. To minimise the risk of contamination, sample processing,PCR set-up and post-PCR analysis involvingelectrophoresis (see paragraphs 4.160-4.164) should be done in separate areas, preferably in separatelaboratories with controlled access. 4.155 The use of sterile disposables (for example pipette tips and tubes) is recommended for the extraction process. Storage and disposal areas fordisposables will therefore be required. 4.156 All tubes should be centrifuged prior to opening; an area for a bench-mounted centrifuge should be provided. 4.157 Areas used for PCR set-up should be away from high-traffic areas, with minimal disturbance. They should not be directly under or near windows, air vents orfrequently-used doors. Mini hoods containing a UV lightsource for disruption of contaminating DNA can be used to create a \"mini PCR set-up area\" that is self-contained. These are best used in a designated PCRset-up room as an extra safeguard against cross-contamination. 4.158 Gloves should be worn and changed regularly; storage and disposal areas for gloves will therefore be required. 4.159 Space should also be provided for sufficient stocks of reagents, for example primers and sterile PCR-grade water. Electrophoresis 4.160 Routine electrophoresis work is automated. However, specialised work is more manual and may require a specialised laboratory. 4.161 All areas used for post-PCR analysis should be kept thoroughly clean before and after use. Cleaning should be carried out using 70% ethanol or 10% bleach.Floor, wall and work surfaces therefore need to be easyto clean and capable of withstanding this cleaningregime. Care should be taken with the detailing of thewall and floor junctions, and the junctions betweendifferent materials, to allow for easy cleaning. 4.162 Such a laboratory will need to accommodate small-scale bench-top equipment comprising a small gel tank, cooled passively or by water, and a compact,lightweight power unit. 4.163 Gloves should be worn to protect against the staining agent, ethidium bromide; storage and disposal areas for gloves will therefore be required. 4.164 This laboratory should be located in close proximity to a cold room and a darkroom. Flow cytometry 4.165 Flow cytometry equipment, used mainly for immunology and haematology work (but also for histocompatibility and immunogenetics), tends to bebench-mounted and controlled via computer. 4.166 Centrifuges are frequently used when preparing samples for examination by flow cytometers; access to centrifuges, as well as reagents in fridges/freezers, willbe required. Access to a safety cabinet may also berequired. This must be appropriately sited since manysamples analysed by flow cytometry will be HIV (andHCV) positive. Containment level 3 facilities 4.167 Laboratory activities on specimens known or suspected to contain pathogens from hazard group 3 should take place in a separate room. This shouldconform to containment level 3 requirements (seeparagraphs 7.3-7.11 for further details). 4.168 No access hatches (or anything else that breaks the sealed floor) should be located in floors within containment zones. There should be a lobby at theentrance/exit to containment level 3 rooms. 4.169 See Appendix 9 for 'Regulations and guidance relating to containment laboratories'. ELECTRON MICROSCOPY FACILITIES 4.170 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is used in diagnostic pathology for a number of processes including renal biopsy interpretation, investigation ofmyopathies and neuropathies, and virus identification. 4.171 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is rarely used for diagnosis, although it continues to have a role in research. Transmission electron microscopy 4.172 A TEM suite should comprise: sample preparation room; HBN 15 FACILITIES FOR PATHOLOGY SERVICES 24 TEM laboratory; darkroom; office. 4.173 The sample preparation room should be maintained as a clean environment, with the air double high-efficiency particle arrester (HEPA) filtered. 4.174 Bench space will be required for equipment and preparation work. The latter uses toxic and flammable chemicals, and appropriate ventilation should thereforebe provided. 4.175 An ultramicrotome station will be required for cutting sections, and a fume cupboard for the preparation of resin (in which samples will beembedded). 4.176 Access to a +4\u00baC fridge will be needed for fixing samples, and to an oven for polymerising samples (following embedding in resin). 4.177 Gloves should be worn and changed regularly; appropriate storage and disposal areas should be provided. 4.178 The TEM laboratory requires space for the TEM and console. The equipment is extremely sensitive to vibration and, although usually supplied with an anti-vibration table, is best located on a ground-bearing slabrather than a suspended slab on an upper floor. 4.179 The room does not require windows and should be capable of total blackout. 4.180 A darkroom and an office may be required. See paragraphs 4.110-4.111 and 4.14-4.20 respectively. Scanning electron microscopy 4.181 A SEM suite should comprise: sample preparation room; SEM laboratory; image processing room; darkroom; office. 4.182 The sample preparation room should be maintained as a clean environment, with the air double HEPA filtered. 4.183 Bench space will be required for a range of equipment including an evaporator, sputter coater, rapid-ion milling system, dimple grinder, jetelectropolisher, microtome and ultramicrotome. 4.184 The SEM room requires space for the SEM and console. The equipment is extremely sensitive tovibration and, although usually supplied with an anti-vibration table, is best located on a ground-bearing slabrather than a suspended slab on an upper floor. 4.185 The room does not require windows and should be capable of total blackout. A storage area and separate area for housing the HT (high tension) tank arerequired. 4.186 An image processing room may be required for processing SEM images. Typically an ergonomically designed workstation is required for the imageprocessing equipment. The room should be capable ofblackout. 4.187 A darkroom and an office may be required. See paragraphs 4.110-4.111 and 4.14-4.20 respectively. Future developments 4.188 Miniaturisation in electronics, particularly in semiconductors, has led to the development of the ultimate small-scale laboratory systems - so-called \"labon a chip\" biological processors, which can detect andmeasure specific analytes. 4.189 \"Lab-on-a-chip\" (LOC) technology is a rapidly growing research topic within the instrumentation and healthcare industries. The principle is to produce anautomated, microscale (or nano-scale) laboratory toenable sample preparation, fluid handling, separation,detection and analysis to be carried out on one platformwithin the confines of a single microchip. 4.190 \"Lab on a chip\" bioanalysers can move labs beyond messy, time-consuming gel preparation and electrophoresis. 4.191 The commercialisation of miniaturised devices is most advanced in the DNA analysis sector. 4.192 The equipment for LOC technology and DNA microassays is bench-mounted and supported by a flat screen display, keyboard and mouse. This can beaccommodated in a specialised laboratory. HISTOPATHOLOGY AND CYTOPATHOLOGY FACILITIES Histopathology 4.193 Histopathology is the morphological study of cells arranged in tissues that have been removed from the human body. See Appendix 6 for details of processesand workflow for a histopathology service. 4 SPECIFIC FUNCTIONAL AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 25Cytopathology 4.194 Cytopathology is the morphological study of dissociated cells. See Appendix 7 for details of processes and workflow for a cytopathology service. Histopathology and cytopathology specimen reception areas 4.195 Each specimen reception area should comprise a reception room with a reception hatch to allow for the deposit of specimens. The hatch should have a fixedcounter and secure hatch doors. The counter surfaceshould be easy to clean, impervious to water, andresistant to disinfectants expected in normal use. 4.196 The reception area should be separated into two areas: one for sorting and handling specimens; and the other for booking in specimens. The booking-in areashould comprise desk-height workstations, while thesorting area should contain bench-height workstations. 4.197 An adequate ventilation system is required to deal with formalin spillages (from specimens delivered in formalin). 4.198 Consideration should be given during the early design stage to merging the specimen reception areas of histopathology and cytopathology with the centralpathology reception area. A pneumatic air tube systemis not suitable for transporting specimens. Histopathology cut-up area (specimen dissection) 4.199 The cut-up area should contain height-adjustable down-draught benches, which provide intermittent exhaust ventilation. Ventilated benches shouldincorporate a sink and macerator, and a sluice for thedisposal of specimens. Particular attention should bepaid to the point at which air extracted from the cutting-up bench is vented, so that it does not re-enter thebuilding or adjacent buildings. 4.200 The ventilation requirements of formalin solution make-up and dispensing areas also need careful consideration. 4.201 Exhaust ventilation is required for waste disposal units used for the disposal of \"fixed\" specimens. 4.202 Particular attention should be given to the noise levels of the ventilated benches to ensure an acceptable working environment. 4.203 A free bench is required for the organisation of the work. 4.204 Floor space should be sufficient to enable the parking of a trolley without blocking any of the aisles. 4.205 A separate room is required for high-risk cut-up of potentially infectious specimens. There should be a lobby at the entrance/exit to the room. The room shouldHBN 15 FACILITIES FOR PATHOLOGY SERVICES 26 Clinical science centre, Wythenshawe Hospital (Photo: Bob Collier)contain a class 1 microbiological safety cabinet for handling specimens. See paragraphs 7.21-7.28 fordetails. 4.206 A clinical hand-wash basin station is required at the exit to the room. Histopathology processing room 4.207 Space will be required for tissue processors. 4.208 Most tissue processors do not require ventilation while in use. When changing reagents, fumes can be released; good ventilation and a down-draught benchare therefore required. 4.209 The processing room should be separate from other facilities as it presents a fire risk, and suitable fire precautions need to be incorporated into the design. 4.210 A free bench is required for the organisation of work. A clinical hand-wash basin station is required at the exit to the room. 4.211 The processing room should be adjacent to the cut-up room. Histopathology wet specimen store 4.212 Space will be required for the storage of large specimens in various sized containers. 4.213 Space will also be needed for the preparation of tissue for prolonged storage in plastic bags (using heat sealing) and for mounting prepared tissue fordemonstration purposes. 4.214 The room should be mechanically ventilated to deal with formalin and other nuisance vapours. 4.215 Alternatively, ventilated cupboard units may be used; these may be situated here or in the cut-up room depending on available space. 4.216 It may be necessary to store fresh tissue in -20\u00baC or -80\u00baC freezers, in which case a separate space should be provided in the central freezer storage room(see paragraph 4.114). 4.217 A separate wash-up area containing a sink with a waste disposal unit and a sluice will be required. General histopathology laboratory 4.218 This laboratory should house a number of microtomy workstations, each comprising a microtome,4 SPECIFIC FUNCTIONAL AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 27General histopathology laboratory Histopathology processing room Specimen lab/ storeSupport lab/storeHigh riskcut upLobbyHatchx x 4x6x x = 3300 mm Figure 4.5 Possible layout of histopathology laboratory facility (see schedules of accommodation for indicative areas for indi vidual laboratories)water bath, hot plate and ice tray. The number of microtomes required will depend upon the workload. 4.219 Routine stains are normally automated, but special stains are carried out manually. A sink, drying oven and automated staining machine should beprovided. 4.220 Bench space will be required for holding glass dishes (used in manual staining) and laying out slides. 4.221 Separate workstations for frozen section work should be provided. These should comprise a below- bench freezer and cryostat or a freezing microtome.Free wall space should be provided if cryostats are tobe used. The workstation should have access tofacilities for drying and staining sections. 4.222 A dedicated area for resin work should be provided, housing a thin resin section microtome and fume cupboard. The area should incorporate dedicatedfacilities for staining and mounting slides. Alternatively,resin work can take place in a separate laboratory. 4.223 Bench space should be provided for special histopathology procedures. This can be in a designated area of the laboratory or in a separate laboratory. 4.224 Down-draught benching should be used throughout the laboratory to remove fumes from the staining and mounting processes. 4.225 A clinical hand-wash basin station should be provided at the exit to the room. Histopathology slide and block store 4.226 Storage space for histopathology slides and blocks should be provided, based on annual workload. The floor loading of such storage items needs to beconsidered when designing the store. 4.227 Consideration should be given to locating long- term storage off-site or distant from the histopathology area. Histopathology chemical store and preparation area 4.228 An area for storing the chemicals and preparing the solutions and stains associated with histopathology work should be provided. Cytopathology processing laboratory 4.229 Laboratory bench space will be required for sorting and recording prepared slides and specimens suspended in fluid. 4.230 A microbiological safety cabinet (class 1) may be required for processing specimens suspended in fluid. 4.231 A centrifuge should be provided for specimens that need to be centrifuged prior to mounting on slides. 4.232 Prepared slides may be stained by automated or manual methods. 4.233 A slide staining machine and sink should be provided for manual staining. 4.234 Automated staining requires dedicated floor or bench space to accommodate the equipment. 4.235 A small oven or incubator should be provided for drying stained slides. A cover-slipping machine should also be available for applying glass cover slips. 4.236 Down-draught benching should be used to remove fumes from the staining and slide mounting processes. 4.237 A separate area for the preparation of semenology specimens may be required. 4.238 Access to a category 3 facility may be required from time to time. See paragraphs 4.167-4.169. 4.239 A clinical hand-wash basin station is required at the exit to the room. Cytopathology reporting room 4.240 An area is required for a number of desk-top mounted double- or multiple-headed microscope stations for teaching and discussion purposes. Thisshould take place in a carpeted office environment. 4.241 The position of all display equipment and microscopes, and the design of desks and chairs, should be carefully considered to minimise glare andprovide a comfortable seating position. Cytopathology screening area 4.242 A quiet, carpeted area should be provided for the microscopic examination of slides. The grade of carpet should minimise the release of fibres. 4.243 A quiet environment is necessary in order to aid the high levels of concentration needed by operators checking slides for subtle cellular differences. Operatorsshould have access to windows giving views of thedistant horizon to enable them to rest their eyes. 4.244 Consideration should be given to the control of glare through the use of blinds and careful positioning of monitors. 4.245 Purpose-designed, height-adjustable chairs with adjustable backrests should be provided. Fabric covers and a wide seat base are preferable. Where possible,seats should be positioned to allow external views. HBN 15 FACILITIES FOR PATHOLOGY SERVICES 284 SPECIFIC FUNCTIONAL AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 294.246 Backrests should be stable to avoid unwanted movements. All seat adjustments and controls should lock securely. Where foot support rings are used, theseshould allow operators to place their feet flat on thefloor. Where circumstances allow, consultation withindividual operators is strongly recommended. 4.247 Height-adjustable benches that offer stable support for microscopes should be provided. Benches should be uniform, neutral in colour and have non-glaresurfaces. Each bench should provide a minimumworking surface area of 1.5 m (width) x 0.9 m (depth).Space should allow for free circulation behind eachoperator without disturbance. 4.248 Artificial light sources that imitate daylight should be provided. Task and pool lighting are not appropriate. 4.249 The room should be provided with air-conditioning and humidity systems that can be controlled locally. Air outlets should be positioned to avoid disturbingoperators with air movements. The use of baffles anddiffusers may be helpful. 4.250 See 'Cytology screening - Ergonomic working standards for personnel engaged in the preparation,scanning and reporting on cervical screening slides', MDA (Medical Devices Agency) for further details onappropriate working arrangements for cytopathology. Cytopathology slide storage 4.251 A room for prolonged storage of cytopathology slides and reports will be needed. This will create an abnormal floor loading condition, which should beconsidered at the earliest stage of planning. Cytopathology offices 4.252 A multi-person open-plan office should be provided for secretarial staff. A number of type A offices for laboratory managers and type B offices forconsultants will also be required. Liquid-based cytopathology laboratory4.253 Where liquid-based cytopathology (LBC) is undertaken, the processing laboratory will require adequate mechanical ventilation to deal with xylene andformaldehyde vapours. This may become the maincytopathology processing laboratory in the future.Cytopathology processing laboratorySpecimen reception Liquid based cytopathology lab Support lab/ store LobbyHatch4x5x xx x = 3300 mmCyto cat 3Support lab/store Figure 4.6 Possible layout of cytopathology laboratory facility (see schedules of accommodation for indicative areas for indiv idual laboratories)HBN 15 FACILITIES FOR PATHOLOGY SERVICES 304.254 The use of an automated system for monitoring formaldehyde levels should be considered. This requires large bench-top equipment, with its associated heatload and service demands. 4.255 There will be a greater requirement for disposal of biological waste, including contaminated plastic, glass and liquid. This may be met by a commercial supplier. 4.256 Storage space for a month's supply of waste buckets should be provided. See HTM 2065 - 'Healthcare waste management' for further details. 4.257 Storage space should also be provided for consumables such as collection vials, preservatives and biohazard vessels. 4.258 LBC may enable the introduction of automated image scanning devices and create extra demand for LAN (local area network) connection points. BLOOD BANK, BLOOD GROUPING AND CROSS- MATCHING FACILITIES 4.259 Facilities should be available for storing blood received from the Regional Blood Transfusion Service and samples of patients' blood. Facilities will also berequired for blood grouping and cross-matching. 4.260 Exceptionally, a venepuncture room may be required for collecting blood from donors. 4.261 See Appendix 8 for details of tests undertaken.Blood bank area 4.262 The blood bank reception area should be adjacent to the blood grouping and cross-matching laboratories, and allow for the reception and delivery ofblood. 4.263 See Appendix 8 for workflow through this area. 4.264 Storage space should be provided for blood transport boxes. Facilities will also be required for recording and labelling blood. 4.265 Blood should be stored in blood bank refrigerators. Cross-matched blood should be stored in separate refrigerators from those containing blood thathas not been cross-matched. 4.266 Authorised hospital staff will require access to the blood bank at all hours. It should therefore be accessible to staff working in the cross-matching andblood grouping laboratories, and allow out-of-hoursaccess. Its location should not require entry to thelaboratory areas, nor should it create a security problem. Blood grouping laboratory 4.267 This area should contain centrifuges, incubators, water baths, cell washers and automated blood grouping apparatus. 4.268 Refrigerators and freezers will be required for storing test materials. Cytopathology training school, Manchester Royal Infirmary4.269 The size of the blood grouping laboratory may be based on the standard modules for laboratories (see Figure 3.1 for details). Cross-matching laboratory 4.270 This should be a similar workspace to the blood grouping laboratory. POINT-OF-CARE TESTING FACILITIES 4.271 The rapid development in recent years of analytical techniques has brought many diagnostic tests closer to the patient both in the hospital ward and in theGP's surgery. Many methods are in routine use, andinclude blood and urine stick tests. 4.272 Commercial interests are driving developments in this field, with the production of more sophisticated POCT equipment including small haematology andchemistry analysers. 4.273 Testing may take place on the ward, in the operating theatre, coronary care unit, critical care area or A&E department. For details of POCT in an A&Esetting, see HBN 22 - 'Accident and emergencyfacilities for adults and children'. 4.274 Testing may also take place at home (for example glucose and pregnancy tests) or at the GP surgery (for example urine dipstick tests). 4.275 The facilities required for POCT will vary depending on the equipment used. 4.276 Typical equipment includes: reagent-impregnated strips for urine or blood; single test equipment for glucose or cholesterol; fully automated instruments such as blood glucose monitoring systems and blood gas/critical care analysers. 4.277 In a hospital environment (for example within A&E), a 2.95 m wide (minimum) x 2.95 m longlaboratory module, allowing back-to-back working atlaboratory benches, is recommended. This can bescaled up to suit the workload and types of testundertaken. 4.278 This module should contain a sink, laboratory benching on which testing equipment and computers can be placed, floor space for under-benchrefrigerators, and separate clinical hand-washingfacilities. Storage space should be provided both aboveand below benching for equipment and supplies. 4.279 In a primary care environment, a POCT consulting area containing an examination couch, desk and chairs, clinical hand-washing facilities and POCT equipmentshould be provided. 4 SPECIFIC FUNCTIONAL AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 31ECONOMY AND VALUE ENGINEERING 5.1Engineering services account for a significant proportion of the capital cost and a continuing charge on revenue budgets. The project design engineer shouldensure economy in provision, whilst achieving functionalrequirements and maintaining clinical standards. 5.2Lifetime costs should be identified as part of the cost-benefit analysis. ENERGY CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY 5.3Energy usage has a major impact on the environment. Heating, ventilation, cooling and lighting should be automatically controlled when not in use (forexample at night or weekends). 5.4Facilities should be designed to meet the requirements of the Building Regulations 2000 Approved Document Part L2, Department of Transport, LocalGovernment and the Regions (DTLR). Natural lighting5.5Natural lighting should be used where possible. Passive solar design (PSD) should ensure that laboratory areas are located where they can benefit from naturaldaylight. Areas that do not benefit from natural lighting(for example stores and toilets) should be locatedtowards the core of the facility. 5.6Solar protection should be provided to minimise solar gain and control glare. This may include the use of brise soleil, solar reduction glazing and internal or mid-pane blinds. Areas where glare may be a problem (forexample rooms where computers are routinely used)should be located away from direct daylight. 5.7Glazing solutions should achieve an average daylight factor of 2%. This should result in the optimum control of glare and solar gain consistent with adequatedaylight. Where solar performance glass is used, thisshould be a neutral colour to ensure good colourrendering. Natural ventilation5.8Natural ventilation should be used where possible.5.9The design should incorporate measures for minimising solar heat gain (see paragraph 5.6). This will reduce the need for mechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation5.10 The shape of the building and/or spatial relationships may result in some enclosed internal areas. Ventilation costs can be minimised by ensuring thatinternal areas are reserved for: a. rooms that require mechanical ventilation irrespective of whether their location is internal or peripheral (for example sanitary facilities); b. spaces that only have transient occupation and therefore require little or no mechanical ventilation (for example circulation and some storage areas). Heat recovery 5.11 Where it is essential for ventilation systems to use 100% fresh air, the practicalities of heat recovery should be investigated. Consideration should be given to thefollowing potential hazards: leakage/recirculation between intake and exhaust air streams; biohazards to maintenance staff; chemical reaction on plant. SPACE REQUIRED FOR PLANT AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS 5.12 Plant areas should provide convenient and safe access, arranged to prevent unauthorised entry. Plant and equipment should be spaced to permit access forroutine inspection and maintenance. Removal andreplacement of plant and components should bepossible without disruption to other services. 5.13 To be most economical, plant should be located as close as possible to the areas served, but with regard to factors such as noise, vibration, flooding and fire. Therisks asssociated with these factors can be minimisedby the introduction of measures such as active firesuppression systems and additional acoustic treatment.A risk analysis should be undertaken to explore themost appropriate solution.HBN 15 FACILITIES FOR PATHOLOGY SERVICES 325 General engineering principles5 GENERAL ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES 335.14 See Appendix 9 for \"Regulations and guidance relating to spatial requirements\". MAINTENANCE OF PLANT AND SERVICES DISTRIBUTION 5.15 All plant (except heat rejection and certain ventilation extract plant) should be located within plantrooms. Main services distribution (cabling andpipework) should be routed above corridors and other circulation spaces. This will allow inspection,maintenance, modifications, additions and renewals tobe undertaken without disruption to the pathologyfacility. 5.16 In clean areas it is important to ensure that plant and equipment are arranged so that access to the space is only required for terminal outlets. 5.17 Engineering services within the pathology facility should be arranged so that they are secure but accessible for maintenance purposes. Only services thatserve the facility should be located above false ceilings,with the exception of drainage. 5.18 In clean areas and other areas requiring non- accessible ceiling voids, access for terminal filters etc should be from below. Access for items such as ceilingvoid smoke detectors should be via lighting fittings. Thiswill avoid the need for sealed access panels. Wheresuspended drainage above clean areas cannot beavoided, the system should have extended cleaningeyes that are accessible remote from the user space. FLEXIBILITY OF DESIGN 5.19 Engineering installations should provide an organised and systematic arrangement that can bemodified to facilitate changes in service requirements.This should be achieved by distributed systems withvertical or horizontal services ducts and bench spines.These should be readily accessible so they can beremodelled and maintained with minimal disruption tothe pathology facility. 5.20 Designers should provide solutions that enable alternative items of equipment to be used in the future, without causing extensive cost and disruption to theassociated engineering service infrastructure. DESIGN FOR SAFETY 5.21 Devices for the control and isolation of primary engineering services should be located in areas wherethey can be protected against unauthorised interference.This includes plantrooms, engineering service spacesand circulation areas. They should not be located inworking areas.5.22 Engineering design has an important role in infection control, particularly the design of water andventilation services. See HTM 2027 - 'Hot and coldwater supply, storage and mains services', HTM 2040 -'The control of legionellae in healthcare premises - A code of practice' and HTM 2025 - 'Ventilation inhealthcare premises' for further details. 5.23 The Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 imposes a statutory duty on all persons who design, manufacture, import, supply, install or erect \"articles foruse at work\". See Appendix 9 under \"Key regulationsrelating to premises and work equipment\". NOISE 5.24 Excessive noise can adversely affect the operational efficiency of a pathology facility and causediscomfort. The limits and means of control aredescribed in HTM 2045 - 'Acoustics'. 5.25 Auditory privacy may be required. Acceptable noise levels and requirements for auditory privacy in individual areas are shown on the Activity Data A-sheets. FIRE SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS 5.26 The principles of fire safety apply equally to new projects, alterations and upgrading of existing buildings. 5.27 Consideration should be given to the fire safety strategy during the design stage. The architect and engineer should verify the proposals with the relevantfire authority. The project team and all other planningstaff should be fully acquainted with the fire safetystrategy. This will include operational aspects such asstaff responsibilities, equipment provision, building andengineering layouts. 5.28 Fire safety policy is set out in the 'Firecode' series of documents. See Appendix 9 for \"Guidance on fire safety\". 5.29 Designers must comply with Building Regulations 2000, Approved Document B, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. DECONTAMINATION OF SYSTEMS 5.30 Engineering services should be designed to allow incidents (for example a spillage of hazardous material)to be dealt with effectively and with minimal risk to staff. 5.31 The design should permit the shortest possible exit route from the hazard area and ready access, if required, to a drencher. Rooms should be able to safelycontain any contamination until it can be removed andfumes have been extracted to a safe concentrationlevel.HEATING SYSTEMS 6.1Spaces heated by low-pressure hot water systems should use low surface temperature radiators or overhead radiant ceiling panels. temperature and allow spacesavings. 6.2Radiators should be located under windows or against exposed walls. There should be space between the top of the radiator and the windowsill to preventcurtains reducing the output. There should be adequatespace underneath (at least several inches) to allowcleaning machinery to be used. Where a radiator islocated on an external wall, back insulation should beprovided to reduce the rate of heat transmission throughthe building fabric. 6.3All radiators should be fitted with thermostatic control valves. These should be of robust construction and selected to match the temperature and pressurecharacteristics of the system. The thermostatic headshould incorporate a tamper-proof facility for pre-settingthe maximum room temperature. It should be controlledvia a sensor located integrally or remotely. To providefrost protection, the valve should not remain closedbelow a fixed temperature. 6.4Radiators should be used to offset only building fabric heat loss in mechanically ventilated rooms. All rooms should have local heating controls; the facilityshould be controlled throughout by the buildingmanagement system (BMS) (see paragraphs 6.63-6.65for details). VENTILATION AND AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEMS 6.5Where possible, natural ventilation should be used. 6.6Mechanical ventilation should be provided to general areas such as plantrooms, toilets and storage areas. 6.7Mechanical ventilation to internal rooms other than laboratories should provide minimum air change. In some cases, cooling will be necessary to maintaincomfortable conditions. A low-velocity mechanicalventilation system should be used. 6.8Diffusers and grilles should be located to encourage uniform air movement without causing discomfort tostaff. The design should allow for airflow from naturallyventilated spaces or spaces with a mechanical airsupply, into spaces that have only mechanical extractventilation, via transfer grilles in doors or walls. 6.9The design should avoid the introduction of untempered air and should not prejudice the requirements of fire safety, privacy, security or comfort. 6.10 There may be limited scope for using recirculated air ventilation systems in pathology facilities. However, the viability of this energy-saving option should beconsidered. 6.11 The supply air distribution system should not distort the unidirectional and stable airflow pattern required for fume cupboards and microbiological safetycabinets. Supply air ceiling diffusers or grilles should notdischarge directly towards fume cupboards or safetycabinets, unless the terminal velocity is such that theairflow pattern is unaffected. 6.12 Grilles and diffusers should be positioned some distance from the front face of fume cupboards and safety cabinets. The design should ensure that high airchange rates and/or opening and closing doors do nothave an adverse effect on the performance of safetycabinets or fume cabinets. A damped door closuremechanism may help. 6.13 The airflow rate for laboratory spaces will be determined by the following criteria: minimum requirement for air changes per hour (when occupied); heat gain from laboratory equipment; solar heat gain; use of fan coil or split local air-conditioning units to offset heat gains; extraction air volumes from fume cupboards, safety cabinets and other items of extract equipment. 6.14 Laboratories containment rooms and rooms using solvents or hazardous materials should be designed with supply and extract systems balanced to maintainHBN 15 FACILITIES FOR PATHOLOGY SERVICES 346 General mechanical engineering servicesnegative pressure. Negative pressure will range from -30 Pa to -50 Pa. 6.15 Ventilation systems for clean laboratories should maintain positive pressures at all times. They should normally use 100% fresh air. In some circumstances,however, it may be possible to re-circulate the ventilatedair. Temperature control should be achieved by meansof reheat coils in supply air systems. 6.16 Design of ventilation systems for summer conditions should be in accordance with CIBSE Guide A. HOT AND COLD WATER SYSTEMS 6.17 Hot and cold water supplies to laboratories should be served by separate storage vessels and pipeworkdistribution systems. There should be signs stating thatthe water is non-drinkable. 6.18 Hot and cold water for general areas of the facility should be taken from the general water supply.6.19 The hot water supply should be 60\u00baC \u00b1 2.5\u00baC at the storage vessel outflow. The return temperature at the calorifier should be at least 50\u00baC. 6.20 Outlet temperatures and fittings for washbasins, sinks and showers are shown on Activity Data Sheets relating to pathology facilities. 6.21 The cold water supply should be kept below 20\u00baC to restrict microbiological growth.6.22 All pipework, valves and flanges for water supply systems should be insulated and vapour-sealed.6.23 An emergency drenching shower should be provided for staff. The floor below the shower should be graded and drain into a suitable gully. 6.24 Hot and cold water systems should be designed in accordance with a number of regulations and guidance (see Appendix 9 for \"Regulations, codes and guidancerelating to hot and cold water systems\"). 6.25 To limit the risk of legionellae bacteria, the water services should meet the requirements of HTM 2040. COOLING SYSTEMS 6.26 Chilled water cooling systems should be used rather than the direct expansion type. If the location permits, the pathology facility could be connected to the main hospital chilled water plant. 6.27 Evaporative-type heat rejection plant should not be used. If cooling cannot be provided from a central chilling plant, a separate air-cooled chiller plant usingenvironmentally friendly refrigerant should be used.6.28 There may be a need to maintain temperatures within specified limits to prevent equipment failure.Temperature limits should be obtained from equipmentmanufacturers. 6.29 Consideration should also be given to the selection of a chilling plant that offers low ambient free cooling to applications requiring year-round cooling (for examplechilled water circuits serving fan coil units in equipmentrooms). DRAINAGE AND WASTE SYSTEMS 6.30 The internal drainage system should use the minimum of pipework and remain water/airtight at all joints and connections. The system should besufficiently ventilated to retain the integrity of waterseals. 6.31 Laboratory waste systems should be made of heat-sealed polypropylene. High silicone iron alloy (14.5%) should be used below ground. 6.32 Laboratories should be provided with an acid- resistant waste and vent system connected, after dilution, to the foul sewer outside the building perimeter.Space should be available for a neutralisation tank sincethis is likely to be required in the future. 6.33 Sink traps and piping to floor drops should be made of acid-resistant materials. Below ground, acid- resistant pipes will not be damaged by minor quantitiesof acids and solvents. Vents should be routed throughthe roof and not connected to sanitary vent piping. 6.34 Drainage systems from pathology laboratories may contain pathogens. To prevent any risk of cross- infection, the system should be routed to avoid otherhospital accommodation such as critical care areas,operating theatres and catering departments. 6.35 Drainage may also contain chemicals and should be designed for maximum dilution. Frequently-used large-volume appliances such as glassware washingmachines should be located upstream. Large-capacitycatch-pot receivers should be provided whereappropriate. 6.36 The internal drainage system should be connected to the main drainage system as far downstream as possible to ensure maximum dilution. The designershould liaise with the statutory authority to agreemaximum discharge volumes and the method ofconnection to main services. 6.37 The drainage system should allow easy access for inspection and maintenance. Access should be above the appliance flood/rim level so that spillage ofcontaminated effluent can be minimised. Access forcleaning should cause minimal disturbance to laboratorystaff. 6 GENERAL MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SERVICES 356.38 The designer should be familiar with the types of discharge produced by specialist equipment and the effect that the mixing of various chemical dischargesmay have upon the drainage system. 6.39 If radioactive effluent is to be discharged into the drainage system, the requirements for catch-pot recovery, dilution and maintenance should be discussedand agreed with the radiological protection advisor. 6.40 Autoclaves (except those used for decontamination of infected material), glassware washing machines and refrigerators should not be connected directly to thedrainage system. They should have an air gap toprevent the ingress of bacteria. 6.41 The sterilizer for discarded material should be connected to the drain via a vented break tank and trap. The break tank should be vented outside the building.The vent termination should be above roof level andclear of any ventilation inlet or window. The trap shouldbe positioned between the break tank and theconnection to the drainage system. 6.42 Floor gullies can become contaminated, and should be avoided or minimised.6.43 Metal pipework is not suitable for use in pathology laboratories. Copper and lead are not suitable for use with effluents containing azide and mercury compounds. 6.44 Glass, polypropylene, and other plastics are suitable, but consideration should be given to the chemical characteristics, temperature of the fluidsdischarged, and arrangements for fixing and supportingthe drain. EXTRACT SYSTEMS 6.45 Extract fans should be located close to the point of discharge to ensure that the extract system ismaintained at negative pressure. 6.46 Extract ducts from general extract, chemical fume cupboards and other special extract systems within the same laboratory unit may be combined into extractmanifolds on each floor. A manifold system offers thefollowing advantages: greatest dilution at stack discharge; increased flexibility for future additions; capital cost saving because of fewer fans and controls; optimum use of roof space; higher efficiency of energy use; reduced maintenance cost; energy recovery capability.6.47 Staining areas should have bench extract systems that ensure air flows away from operators' faces. Low- level extract should be provided adjacent to equipmentfor use when solvents are changed or when specimensin formaldehyde are opened. 6.48 External discharge arrangements for extract systems should be protected against back pressure from adverse wind effects. They should be located toavoid reintroduction of exhausted air into the buildingthrough air intakes and windows. CONTROL SYSTEMS 6.49 All supply and extract systems should have local control systems. These should be integrated with theoverall BMS (see paragraphs 6.63-6.65 for details). 6.50 Controls should include temperature, pressure and time-switching functions. Their selection should take account of the extent to which they can be linked to theBMS serving the whole hospital. 6.51 Supply and extract fans should be interlocked. This will ensure that the supply fan will not operate unless airflow is established with the extract system. 6.52 All heater battery coils and filters should be provided with frost protection control.6.53 Control systems should incorporate energy-efficient equipment including: high-efficiency motors; variable air volume systems (in laboratories); suitable air-to-air heat recovery systems.6.54 Laboratory air-conditioning systems should be controlled to ensure comfort, operational safety and regulatory compliance, and to satisfy processconstraints. A well-controlled system should provideflexibility and minimise the operational costs of thesystem. 6.55 A control system should provide the following minimal safety responses: detection of equipment failure by the BMS and automatic initiation of standby equipment; maintenance of relative negative and positive pressures in the laboratories; cessation of the air supply to laboratories to increase negative pressure levels in response to fire or smoke detection. Opening exit doors should not be affectedby this provision.HBN 15 FACILITIES FOR PATHOLOGY SERVICES 366 GENERAL MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SERVICES 376.56 The control of supply air volumes using a variable air volume (VAV) type system is recommended for large laboratories. Supply and extract air volumes should bebalanced to achieve desired pressurisation levels. Eachfume cupboard should be controlled to maintain aconstant face velocity. The VAV supply system shouldprovide temperature control and maintain the minimumroom ventilation rate. 6.57 Laboratory spaces should be comfort cooled without local humidity control. Large laboratory spaces should be zoned, with each zone equipped with athermostat for individual control. Local control of ventilation plant6.58 It may be necessary to have more than one microbiological safety cabinet and fume cabinet. Therefore, local controls for operating any associatedventilation plant will be necessary. 6.59 Work in the containment level 3 rooms should only be undertaken when ventilation systems serving associated rooms are operating. 6.60 Where \"make up\" air is provided by mechanical ventilation, a supply air failure warning system should be provided. If any safety enclosure or room extract systemfails, the associated supply system should be capable ofbeing shut down automatically or reduced to preventpressurisation of the room and possible contaminationof adjacent areas.6.61 The ventilation control system for safety cabinets should incorporate a five-minute delay timer. This willensure that the system will continue to run after workhas finished and purge any remaining contaminants. PNEUMATIC TUBE SYSTEMS 6.62 A pneumatic tube system will be required for the transfer of specimens to and from other departments to stations within the pathology facility. The systemshould be designed in accordance with HTM 2009. BUILDING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 6.63 Engineering plant and equipment should be monitored and regulated by the BMS, in accordancewith HTM 2005 - 'Building management systems'. 6.64 Plant and system operational data should be recorded and reported. The BMS should also monitor, measure and record energy consumption for the facility. 6.65 If the main site has a BMS, the pathology facility should be set up as an outstation so that systems serving the facility can be monitored and controlled at a central station. The engineering systems within thefacility should be capable of management from both thecentral station and the outstation itself. Cytopathology training school, Manchester Royal InfirmaryHBN 15 FACILITIES FOR PATHOLOGY SERVICES 38MAXIMUM DEMANDS 7.1Discussions with end users and manufacturers should take place to determine the service requirements of specialist equipment. 7.2The engineering service demands and capacities in Table 7.1 apply to a pathology facility of approximately 3000 m2gross area. MECHANICAL ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS OF SPECIFIC SPACES Containment level 3 laboratories 7.3Ventilation of containment level 3 laboratories should ensure a continuous airflow into the laboratory, when work is being undertaken on pathogens. The exhaust airshould be ducted from a microbiological safety cabinetto the outside through a HEPA filter. 7.4Containment level 3 laboratories must be maintained at negative air pressure.7.5In the event of fan failure, the system should indicate the failure through an alarm, and also fail to a safe operational state. To achieve this, the system should bedesigned to ensure that the air supply fan shuts down ifa failure of the extract system is detected, thus avoidingpositive pressurisation of the room.7.6The airtightness of the room should ensure that there is no leakage to the outside, but considerationshould be given to the provision of a standby extractventilation system. This should be operable from outsidethe containment room and should be protected by aHEPA filter. 7.7Safety cabinets and any separate extract system should be locally controlled to reduce the frequency at which HEPA filters need to be changed, and to permitthe cabinet and rooms to be sealed for fumigation if aspillage occurs. 7.8Safety cabinet fan(s) should be interlocked with general ventilation systems to maintain the desired air flow patterns. Where a separate supplementary extractis provided, the extract volume can be varied tocompensate for stationary safety cabinet fan(s). 7.9Supply and extract systems should be interlocked to prevent positive pressurisation of the room in the event of failure of the extract fan. Ventilation systems shouldalso incorporate a means of preventing reverse airflows. 7.10 The laboratory, including all ductwork and services, should be designed so that it can be sealed to permit fumigation. Ventilation controls for purging the spaceshould be located outside the laboratory. 7.11 See Appendix 9 for \"Regulations and guidance relating to containment laboratories\".7 Specific mechanical engineering services Service Typical max demand Notes Heating/ventilation/domestic hot water service 430 kW Cooling 85 kW Cold water 2.5 litres/sec 10,000 litres storage (24-hour supply) Laboratory cold water 3.0 litres/sec 12,000 litres storage (24-hour supply) De-ionised water 1.9 litres/sec 400 litres storage Hot water service 2.9 litres/sec 1000 litres storage (2 hours recovery) Supply ventilation 12 m2/s Extract ventilation 13.55 m2/s Electrical 178 kVA Inc 69 kVA essential Fuel gas (bench services) 0.6 litres/sec Steam 0.1 kg/sec At 5 barTABLE 7.1Hot rooms 7.12 Hot rooms should be well insulated and maintained at 37 \u00b1 0.5\u00baC. They should have lockable doors with internal safety release mechanisms. 7.13 The design of the heating system should provide an even distribution of air without stratification within the space. 7.14 A recording thermometer should be visible from outside the room. It should be connected to local and remote high/low temperature alarms. Cold rooms and blood bank7.15 Cold rooms should be maintained at a temperature of 5 \u00b1 1\u00baC. They should be well insulated and designed in accordance with BS 2502. Doors should have internalsafety releases. 7.16 Ceiling-mounted evaporators should provide low- velocity air distribution without stratification and with sufficient capacity to allow a rapid response to changesin temperature. 7.17 Free-standing blood bank cabinets should operate at 5 \u00b1 1\u00baC and should be designed in accordance with the relevant BS EN Code of Practice. 7.18 They should be capable of storing blood at a uniform temperature throughout the cabinet. There should be no rise in the internal temperature of thecabinet during the defrost cycle. 7.19 Refrigeration systems should incorporate duty and standby compressors. Selection of the duty compressor should be manual, with automatic changeover tostandby if the duty compressor fails. Air-cooledcondensers should be located outside the building. 7.20 Each cold room and blood bank cabinet should have a tamper-proof temperature recorder mounted externally. It should be equipped with a battery-maintained audio/visual alarm providing remoteindication at the telephone exchange (or otherpermanently manned station). This should warn if thetemperature rises or falls beyond a pre-set range. Apulsating lamp signal should indicate when there hasbeen a refrigeration system malfunction or a mainsfailure. MECHANICAL ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS OF SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT/FURNITURE Microbiological safety cabinets 7.21 A class 1 microbiological safety cabinet should be specified for routine work involving group 3 pathogens. 7.22 Siting and installation are of particular importance since: the protection afforded to the operator by the cabinet depends on a specific and stable unidirectional airflow through the open front; the protection afforded to the environment by the cabinet depends on the high-efficiency particulate airfilters as shown in Table 7.2. 7.23 Exhaust air should never be regarded as totally free from microbiological hazard. 7.24 Hazardous agents are contained within microbiological safety cabinets by maintaining negative pressurisation and use of HEPA filters. All safetycabinets should be equipped with visual and audiblealarms warning of unsafe airflow. 7.25 The general extract from containment level 3 laboratories and from class 2 microbiological safety cabinets should be HEPA-filtered. 7.26 Microbiological safety cabinets in containment level 2 and 3 laboratories may be manifolded within the same laboratory unit. All microbiological safety cabinet extractshould be separated from fume-cupboard and generalextract.7 SPECIFIC MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SERVICES 39Microbiological safety cabinet classFace velocity m/s Airflow pattern Containment level Product protection Class 1 0.7-1.0In at front; extract through HEPA filter2, 3 0.4Some air re-circulatedthrough HEPA; laminarairflow; extract throughHEPA 2, 3 3 N/ASupply air inlets andextract through 2 HEPAfilters 3, 4 Yes Notesa) Class 3 microbiological safety cabinets have closed fronts with glove port assemblies b) If extract air from a class 1 or class 2 microbiological safety cabinet is discharged into the room, double HEPA filters sho uld be providedTABLE 7.2HBN 15 FACILITIES FOR PATHOLOGY SERVICES 407.27 The discharge from HEPA-filtered safety cabinets is relatively clean. Discharge to outside provides additional safeguards by dilution (in the event of filter failure). Toavoid air re-entering the building, a roof-level dischargeis preferred. In such an installation, the extract fanshould be situated separate from the cabinet and closeto the discharge outlet to maintain the duct undernegative pressure. 7.28 The design, installation and use of microbiological safety cabinets are governed by a number of codes and standards. For further details see Appendix 9 under\"Codes, standards and other guidance relevant to thedesign and use of microbiological safety cabinets\". Fume cupboards7.29 Fume cupboards should have an adequate volume of draught-free replacement supply air and an effective exhaust system to enable the safe dispersal of wasteproducts into the atmosphere. 7.30 Chemical fume cupboards should maintain an average velocity of 0.5 m/s at the design sash position. Constant volume fume cupboards will operate at lowervelocities, down to a minimum of 0.3 m/s. 7.31 Fume cupboards should be constructed of non- combustible materials that are resistant to corrosion and deterioration. 7.32 Each fume cupboard should be equipped with a monitoring device and visual/audible alarm. 7.33 Fume cupboards designated by the Environmental Health and Safety Authority as especially hazardous should have a dedicated extract duct, fan and, ifrequired, treatment system. This category may includeradioisotope and perchloric acid cupboards. 7.34 The possibility of a fire or explosion that cannot be contained by a fume cupboard should be considered. A fume cupboard should not, therefore, be sited in aposition where exit to an escape route will necessitatepassing directly in front of it. 7.35 Fume cupboards fans should be installed as near as possible to the termination of the duct, thus maintaining the maximum amount of ductwork at anegative pressure. In certain circumstances, where thereare adjacent buildings with open windows or wheredowndraught occurs, it may be necessary to increasethe height of discharge ducts to achieve adequatedispersal. 7.36 To optimise the dispersal of fumes, a collection duct and a small stack may be considered where otherwise there would be a requirement for a largenumber of separate stacks.7.37 The optimum height of the stack should be established by carrying out a wind tunnel test orcomputer modelling. The exhaust system of individualfume cupboards should discharge via non-returndampers into a collection duct. 7.38 The collection duct should have a large cross- sectional area to minimise the effect of individual exhaust systems. It should be open to the atmosphere,up-stream of the first connection, and discharge a totalair volume at least equal to the combined individualextract systems. 7.39 Fume cupboards for certain processes should have separate exhaust systems. 7.40 Individual extract systems, discharging directly into the atmosphere or into a collection duct, do not require duplex fans. The collection duct provides dispersal ofeffluent for a number of individual extracts and shouldhave duplex fans with automatic changeover. 7.41 Fume cupboards should be installed to the requirements of BS 7258 and designed in accordance with a number of British Standards (see Appendix 9 for \"British Standards governing design of fumecupboards\"). Dissecting benches7.42 Air should flow towards dissecting benches from adjoining spaces. Local ventilation should limit the concentration of formaldehyde vapour within thebreathing zone of the operator. The recommendedthreshold limit value is 2 ppm. 7.43 The following system parameters outlined are aimed at maintaining a concentration below 1 ppm.7.44 A continuous run of benching (with a continuous up-stand at the rear) should be provided for dissecting activities. Benches should be a maximum of 650 mmdeep (that is, from front to rear). 7.45 Each dissecting position should have a linear extract grille mounted with its face flush with the up- stand. 7.46 The bottom of the grille should be as close as practicable to the level of the working surface. For cleaning purposes, the minimum height of the bottom ofthe grille opening above the working surface should be75 mm. 7.47 Each dissecting position should be 1.2 m long. The extract grille should also be 1.2 m long and 150 mm high. It should be mounted on a purpose-designed plenum box to ensure a minimum uniform facevelocity of 1 m/s along the total length, and across thefull height, of the grille opening. 7 SPECIFIC MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SERVICES 417.48 The grille should be easily de-mountable to permit periodic internal cleaning of the plenum box and any guide vanes. 7.49 Filtration of the extract system is not necessary. Extract hoods and laminar flow cabinets 7.50 Hoods are required over some equipment for the extraction of toxic fumes, odours heat and vapours. 7.51 A minimum hood face velocity of 0.2 m/sec should provide sufficient capture velocity near the process. A compact arrangement of equipment will minimise thehood area and reduce the air volume necessary toachieve the optimum capture velocity. 7.52 Hoods required for the control of heat gain and vapours can be connected to the general extract system. Guidance on the design of hoods is available in CIBSE Guide B2. 7.53 Very high temperatures are produced when burning nitrous oxide and acetylene in atomic absorption spectrometers. Heat damage can beavoided by designing the hood and extract system toensure adequate dilution of the products of combustion.Provided flue gases are adequately diluted, the extractsystem may be connected to one of the main laboratoryextract systems. A separate discharge is preferredwhere corrosive resistant ductwork materials arenecessary. 7.54 Vertical laminar flow cabinets (designed in accordance with BS 5726) may be required for media preparation. These cabinets operate by drawing air fromthe laboratory and discharging filtered air unidirectionallyover the workspace. 7.55 Although they protect the media from contamination, protection of the operator depends on the design of the cabinet and subsequent maintenance.Limitations on the use of class 2 cabinets are given in 'The management, design and operation ofmicrobiological containment laboratories', AdvisoryCommittee on Dangerous Pathogens. Washing/drying machines7.56 Washing/drying machines will be required to ensure that soiled glassware and hollowware are clean and microbiologically safe for re-use. The machinesshould be purpose-designed, and the final rinse cycleshould allow the use of de-ionised water. 7.57 A minimum water pressure of 1 bar is required. Sterilizers7.58 Sterilizers are required for sterilizing media, apparatus and discarded materials. Two multifunctionalunits will be required. Each unit should have a capacity of 0.4 cubic metres and a peak steam supply ofapproximately 180 kg/hour at a pressure of 5.0 bar(g). 7.59 Automatic media preparation systems are also used for sterilizing microbiological culture media. They consist of two or three modules designed to providecontrolled preparation, sterilization, cooling anddispensing of media with minimum intervention by the operator.. 7.60 The sterilizer plantroom should be ventilated to offset the heat generated by the plant. It should be protected from frost when it is not in use. Additionalspace should be provided if separate steam generatorsand water treatment plant are to be installed. 7.61 Further guidance concerning the selection and installation of sterilizers is contained in HTM 2010 - 'Sterilization'. MECHANICAL ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS OF SPECIFIC FIXTURES/FITTINGS Building extract stacks and air intakes 7.62 The fume extract stacks should terminate above the highest point of the building including penthouses and roof parapets. This will facilitate the removal ofhazardous materials from the building and ensure safedilution levels. The height of the stacks should becarefully determined in conjunction with localregulations. 7.63 Stacks should be tall enough to offer adequate protection to maintenance personnel. The minimum height of the termination point should be 3 m above thehighest point of the building, or 1.25 multiplied by thehighest point of the building in metres (whichever isgreater). 7.64 The minimum discharge velocity from the stacks should be 15 m/s. This will counteract any re- entrainment due to varying wind direction orenvironmental features. If vapour condensation mayoccur inside the stack, the discharge velocity should notexceed 10 m/sec. 7.65 Stacks should not terminate within enclosures or architectural screens. Architectural masking structures may be used, but the stack must extend at least onediameter above the structure. 7.66 Re-circulation of hazardous fumes from the stacks should be avoided by sufficient separation of exhaust from air intakes. 7.67 Air intakes should be located high above the ground to avoid dust or vehicle exhaust, and away from other sources of potential contamination such as vehiclewaiting areas and refuse collection points.HBN 15 FACILITIES FOR PATHOLOGY SERVICES 427.68 Consideration should be given to the effect of local physical and environmental conditions such as building geometry, wind conditions, surrounding buildings andtrees, which may affect the effluent dispersion patternsaround the pathology building. Filters7.69 Pre-filters and main filters should be provided for all air-conditioned spaces. Pre-filter efficiency should be G3 and final filter efficiency should be F6 (F8 if followed byHEPA terminal filter). 7.70 HEPA class 14 to BS EN 1822-1 filtration standard is required for certain laboratories such as biological containment category 3 laboratories, suites dealing withradioactive materials, and all clean rooms (for exampletissue culture, DNA extraction and PCR rooms). 7.71 Filters should be readily accessible for replacement and maintenance purposes. They should be provided with audible and visual pressure-differential alarms toindicate when replacement is required. Ductwork and fans7.72 Laboratory air extract systems should remove laboratory air through fume cupboards, canopy hoods, safety cabinets, snorkels or ceiling grilles. Extract fromlike areas may be grouped together into the sameextract system. 7.73 Supply air, return air, and non-contaminated laboratory extract air should be handled in galvanised steel low- and medium-pressure ductwork. 7.74 Fume cupboard extract ducts should be constructed of 16- or 18-gauge stainless steel, PVC-coated galvanised steel, polypropylene or PVCductwork. Longitudinal sections of extract ducts shouldbe a continuous seamless tube or continuously-weldedformed sheet.7.75 Low leakage levels should be maintained in both the supply and extract ducts. Duct velocity in the fumeextract duct mains should not exceed 10 m/s. 7.76 In event of failure, balancing and control dampers in the extract system should fail in the open position. 7.77 Fire dampers should not be placed in the fume extract ductwork.7.78 All fume cupboard extract ductwork within the building should be under negative pressure; fans should discharge directly to the extract stacks. 7.79 All fan materials or coatings in the air stream of the fume extract should be corrosion- and solvent-resistant. Fans should be located outside the building or in aseparate room under negative pressure and providedwith direct access to the outside. Fire resistance of ductwork7.80 Extract duct routes should avoid passing through other fire compartments. If this is unavoidable, the duct should be fire-resistant or have fire dampers. 7.81 Extract systems for microbiological safety cabinets and fume cupboards used for processes involving highly toxic and/or aggressive substances should not have firedampers. These ducts should be provided with fireprotection or fitted with intumescent collars. MECHANICAL ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO PROVISION/TREATMENT OFMATERIALS Purified water 7.82 A supply of de-ionised water will be required for laboratory use and for the final rinse cycle of glassware washing machines. It should be produced in a centralplant dedicated to pathology use. Clinical science centre, Wythenshawe Hospital (Photo: Bob Collier)7 SPECIFIC MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SERVICES 437.83 Small quantities of distilled water will be required in some laboratories and should be produced locally using portable electrically-operated automatic stills.Alternatively, supplies of treated water may be broughtin. Condensed steam from the hospital boiler plant isnot a suitable alternative. 7.84 The central de-ionisation plant and purification modules should be determined by local needs. 7.85 A laboratory grade BS EN ISO 3696 grade 1, 2, 3 reverse osmosis de-ionised water system should be supplied at 2-mega ohm cm resistivity at point of use,recirculated and filtered to maintain high purity. 7.86 Final selection will depend upon the raw water supply, the aggregate demand and the purity level required. 7.87 A reverse osmosis unit combined with ion exchange, together with an appropriate storage unit, will normally provide the most efficient and economicalinstallation. 7.88 The size and location of the plant and storage tank should be determined at an early stage. This will ensure that the required flow rates are obtained economicallyand efficiently, and distribution pipework is kept to aminimum. 7.89 Attention is required in the construction of the storage and distribution system to ensure the purity of the water. Distribution pipework and the storage vesselshould be manufactured from ABS class E or UPVCplastics. The system should have a fully automatic\"dump\" facility to ensure that water below the requiredstandard is discharged to drain. 7.90 Purified water (10-18 mega ohm cm) should be supplied using de-ionised water from local polishing units in selected laboratories (as requested in theActivity Data Sheets). 7.91 De-ionised water pipework should be high-density polyethylene or unpigmented polypropylene with heat- sealed joints. 7.92 The laboratory hot and cold water services should be copper tube standard BS EN 1057, R250 (class X) with copper fittings to BS EN 1254. 7.93 The purified water system should be designed in accordance with HTM 2027.Laboratory gases7.94 Pathology gases should be piped, although small quantities may be supplied from portable cylinders (for example acetylene at gauge pressures not exceeding0.6 bar). Prior approval of proposals should be obtainedfrom the Health and Safety Executive. 7.95 A specialist contractor should install and test the pipe system for laboratory gases. 7.96 The system should be capable of modification and extension. However, plugged tee outlets for future change of use should not be provided. 7.97 Terminal units for medical gases, medical compressed air and medical vacuum should not be used in a pathology laboratory. 7.98 A piped vacuum system is not required. Portable vacuum pumps working at -0.5 to -0.6 bar should be sufficient. 7.99 Oil-free compressed air should be supplied by exclusive small local units. A piped system is unnecessary. 7.100 Laboratory gases should be stored in a ventilated, secure external enclosure similar but separate from the medical gases store. 7.101 Further guidance on medical gases is contained in HTM 2022 - 'Medical gas pipeline systems'; this information is also applicable to laboratory gases. Steam7.102 Sterilizers, washing/drying equipment and humidifiers will require steam. If hospital steam is available, it should be reduced to a pressure of5.0 bar(g). Clean steam is not required for this purpose. 7.103 If hospital steam is not available, a local steam generating plant should be provided. It should be able to respond to sudden changes in demand. Steamgenerators should be fired on natural gas and/or gas oilto avoid the high operating cost of electricity. Clinical waste7.104 Waste that is not miscible with water should be incinerated or consigned to the local authority/private contractor for disposal (after it has been effectivelytreated in accordance with Health Guidance Note -'Safe disposal of clinical waste - whole hospital policyguidance'). 7.105 Waste disposal units should be free-standing and permanently connected to the main drainage system. They should have a solenoid valve to prevent operationunless a minimum flow of water is established. Thebranch drain should be located where adequate dilutioncan be assured. The unit should incorporate pressurisedflushing and cleaning of the waste hopper.HBN 15 FACILITIES FOR PATHOLOGY SERVICES 44INCOMING SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION BOARD 8.1The point of entry for the electrical supply will be a switchcupboard housing the main isolators and distribution equipment. This space should also be thedistribution centre for subsidiary electrical services. 8.2Wherever possible, all equipment should be mounted at a height to give easy access from a standing position. 8.3All switchgear should be lockable in the \"off\" position. EMERGENCY ELECTRICAL SUPPLIES 8.4Emergency electrical provision should comply with the requirements of HTM 2011 - 'Emergency electrical services'. It should have an automatic changeover to anemergency generator supply in the event of a mainsfailure. 8.5The emergency generator should be capable of providing full (100%) backup to the pathology facility, excluding the refrigeration plant serving the air-conditioning and comfort cooling plant. 8.6If the 100% coverage requirement cannot be met using an existing generator, it will be necessary to replace it with a larger set or provide separate essentialand non-essential distribution systems, as detailed inHTM 2011. 8.7Equipment and systems that cannot tolerate the delay inherent in bringing an emergency generator supply on line (particularly computer equipmentassociated with automated analytical systems) shouldbe provided with an uninterruptible power supply. 8.8In the event of a main supply or local final circuit failure, escape routes should be illuminated in accordance with HTM 2011 and BS 5266. These shouldbe self-contained, battery-powered luminaires, chargedcontinuously from the main supply and capable ofproviding illumination for a period of three hours. ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS 8.9Electrical installations should comply with BS 7671 (IEE Regulations - 16th edition), and HTM 2007 -'Electrical services supply and distribution'.8.10 Electrical installations in occupied areas should be concealed using low smoke and fume (LSF) insulatedcable in containment conduit or trunking. In certaincircumstances, mineral-insulated metal-sheathed cablesmay be necessary. 8.11 There should be separate containment for communication and data systems. This should be concealed wherever possible. 8.12 Laboratory sub-distribution panel-boards with locking covers should be located in corridors for safe access in the event of an emergency. Non-laboratoryloads should be served by separate sub-distributionpanel-boards located in the electrical rooms (orcorridors, if necessary) relevant to the particular floor. 8.13 Laboratory sub-distribution panel-boards should serve one or two laboratory units, depending on size. The panel-board bus bars should be suitably rated toallow for future flexibility and additional spare capacity. 8.14 Dual compartment trunking should be used at bench tops. One compartment should be for power distribution and the other for data and communicationsdistribution. 8.15 Due to potential electromagnetic interference between power and IT cabling, parallel services should be run with suitable separation between them other thanat bench tops and workspaces. 8.16 There should be sufficient 13 amp switched shuttered socket-outlets, connected to ring circuits or spurs, to allow all portable appliances (likely to beused simultaneously) to be individually supplied. Theinstallation of twin outlets should be considered wherethese activities occur in juxtaposition. An above-averageprovision of socket-outlets will be required for benchservices. 8.17 A socket-outlet trunking system can provide flexibility and minimise disturbance when repositioning or adding outlets. See HTM 2007 for information onRCD protection in laboratories and areas with trailingleads. For general guidance on the use of RCDprotection also see HTM 2007. 8 Electrical engineering services8 ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING SERVICES 458.18 Domestic cleaning appliance flexible leads are 9 m long. Socket-outlets should be provided to enable the machines to operate over the whole area of the facility. 8.19 Fixed appliances rated up to 13 amps should be permanently connected to double-pole switched spur boxes and fused as required. Appliances rated inexcess of this load, or those requiring a three-phasesupply, should be permanently connected to separatefinal circuits from fuse-boards. These should beindependently switched at a local isolator of appropriaterating. 8.20 Local switches or other means of electrical isolation should be provided adjacent to plant. The equipment should be suitably labelled to ensure thesafety of operators and maintenance staff. 8.21 Ventilation equipment and automatically operated equipment should be provided with indicator lights to show when the equipment is energised. Indicatorsshould be incorporated in the control panel of theapparatus, in the control switch, or in the outlet fromwhich the apparatus derives its supply. 8.22 The electrical supply to electro-medical equipment should comply with BS EN 60601-1 to avoid corruption of input data. Some equipment may require automaticdisconnection, with manual reset, following a mainsfailure. Other computer-controlled analytical equipmentmay require an uninterruptible power supply from astatic inverter of appropriate capacity. 8.23 A dedicated, clean earth network should be accessible to all laboratories and laboratory support spaces requiring a clean earth for laboratoryinstruments. This system should consist of a network oflarge-capacity cables with connections into all laboratoryareas. The network should terminate in a single-pointearth connection. ELECTRICAL INTERFERENCE 8.24 Guidance concerning the avoidance and abatement of electrical interference is given in HTM 2014 - 'Abatement of electrical interference'.Fluorescent luminaires should comply with BS EN55015. 8.25 Care should be taken to avoid mains-borne interference, harmonics and electrical radio frequency interference, which could affect computers and otherelectronic equipment. LINE CONDITIONING 8.26 High-energy transient voltage surge suppression devices should be provided with high-frequency linenoise filtering, suitable for application in category A, B,and C3 environments as required.ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE 8.27 Electromagnetic interference is a potential problem requiring solutions to minimise the effect between powerand data systems. The primary power service should belocated as far as possible from laboratories. LIGHTING 8.28 Practical methods of lighting the various functional spaces are contained in BS EN 12464-1. Luminairesshould be manufactured and tested in accordance withBS 4533. Their location should afford ready access forlamp changing and maintenance, although theoverriding requirement is that the recommendedstandard of illumination is provided. 8.29 Fluorescent lighting in consulting, examination, and venepuncture areas should be derived from lamps with suitable colour rendering, index 1a for clinical areas, andcolour temperature 3000-4000 K. 8.30 Control of lighting is normally by local switches, and these should be provided in sufficient numbers to allow variation in lighting options. Such a facility isparticularly important in large spaces where daylightlevels are not uniform, and artificial lighting is likely to beneeded for long periods in areas remote from windows. 8.31 To conserve energy, consideration should be given to photocell control of perimeter lighting zones and passive infra-red (PIR) control of lighting in intermittentlyoccupied areas. 8.32 In areas where computer terminals are to be used, lighting should be designed to avoid bright reflections on the screen and to ensure that the contents of the screenare legible. Further guidance can be found in CIBSELighting Guide (LG) 3. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) 8.33 Where possible, a structured wiring system should be provided (see Health Guidance Note - 'Structuredcabling for IT systems' for further details). This willpermit a unified approach to the provision of cabling for: voice systems; data Whilst this \"universal\" cabling system is initially more expensive than separate voice and data systems, the long-term cost is less.8.35 In determining the nature of the IT system to be provided, it is necessary to identify: rooms to be served; whether structured cabling will be used; what density of outlets is to be provided (not fewer than two per workstation); whether wiring will be on a \"flood\" or \"as required\" basis. TELEPHONE SYSTEMS 8.36 It may be beneficial to integrate voice cabling with the structured wiring system for IT. 8.37 Where a cabling system supporting voice/data is not available, the existing hospital block wiring should be extended to serve telephones within the pathologyfacility. 8.38 Telephones will normally be situated on desks, but wall-mounted telephones or a \"hands-off\" loudspeaking facility may be required in some areas. Wiring shouldterminate at each extension point in a standard point ina standard line jack unit. SECURITY SYSTEMS 8.39 A closed-circuit television system should be provided or extended from existing site-wide systems.This should allow video recording and cover external,entrance and reception areas. The entry of the publicinto the facility should be controlled from the receptionarea. 8.40 Staff access should be by means of swipe cards with second-level entry (second card or priority card) to sensitive areas. This should be supported byappropriate intercom systems. All external doors, anddoors to sensitive areas, should be monitored. Localalarms should be provided for high-risk areas.FIRE DETECTION AND ALARM SYSTEMS 8.41 The fire detection and alarm system should have automatic detectors of dual heat/smoke type. It shouldconform to the requirements of BS 5839 (Part 1, systemtype L2) and the appropriate authorities. 8.42 The system should be a fully addressable monitored system. It should be mains-powered with battery back-up and have break-glass, push-button callpoints and sounders. 8.43 The system should be suitably zoned and incorporate a main fire alarm panel located at the main entrance/reception. 8.44 The fire alarm should interface with BMS, mechanical plant, generators, lifts, security and access control systems to control or shut down plant andrelease doors in the event of a fire. LIGHTNING PROTECTION 8.45 A risk assessment should be carried out for the building in accordance with BS 6651. A lightningprotection system should be provided that links all roof-mounted equipment and structural steel. Wherepossible, the building structure should be used for themain lightning protection conductors. 8.46 Transient over-voltage protection should be provided on the main LV switchboards and on distribution boards supplying sensitive equipment. RADIO AND TV AERIAL SYSTEM 8.47 A system of terrestrial aerials, boosters and cabling should be provided to outlets in staff rooms and seminarrooms.HBN 15 FACILITIES FOR PATHOLOGY SERVICES 4647INTRODUCTION 9.1 Building costs and revenue expenditure for all types of healthcare facility should be kept as low as possible, consistent with requirements. In applying this guidance,the need for economy should always be of primeconcern. Where appropriate, space should be sharedbetween similar activities taking place at different times.However, this solution should not be detrimental to theproper functioning of the spaces involved nor to theneeds of users. DEPARTMENTAL COST ALLOWANCE GUIDES (DCAGs) 9.2 Departmental Cost Allowance Guides (DCAGs) related to this HBN are published in 'Quarterly Briefing' (NHS Estates). For a full listing of all DCAGs see'Healthcare Capital Investment' (NHS Estates). 9.3 The 'Capital Investment Manual: Business Case Guide' (DH) aims to reduce planning work and to encourage the production of sound business casesupport of both capital and revenue expenditure. Capitalworks estimates should be based, wherever applicable,on industry norms, such as DCAGs plus a percentageto cover on-costs. 9.4 The DCAGs for this HBN reflect the total building, engineering and accommodation requirements for pathology services generally located on an acutehospital site, where common services are shared. Costsare based on a typical two-storey new-build unit on agreenfield site with no planning constraints. 9.5 DCAGs are exclusive of VAT, building and planning fees and all local authority charges, and are based on a location factor of one. ON-COSTS 9.6 An allowance for on-costs (such as external works, external engineering services and abnormals) should be added to the DCAGs. Abnormals will largely bedetermined by site characteristics (such as an inner-citylocation or poor ground conditions) and by the conditionor type of any building to be refurbished. 9.7 Project teams should assess all likely on-cost implications of individual sites and schemes at theearliest opportunity. LOCATIONAL FACTORS 9.8 Locational factor adjustments should be applied to works costs (that is, DCAGs plus established on-costs)to take account of local market conditions. For furtherinformation, see 'Quarterly Briefing'. FUNCTIONAL UNITS 9.9 The schedules of accommodation use a modular approach to the planning of pathology facilities. 9.10 Examples using this modular approach are set out below. Areas given are for guidance only and will alter depending on the design solution. DCAGs have beencalculated using the examples as a cost base. SCHEDULES OF ACCOMMODATION 9.11 The schedules of accommodation show notional whole departments, which highlight the scope forsharing accommodation. The examples are not to betaken as ideal provision for any particular project. 9.12 The examples are as follows: Example 1: Full pathology service on an acute site serving a whole network. Example 2: Urgent and emergency pathology request service only on an acute site. Example 3: Routine, specialised and non-urgent pathology service on a standalone site coveringseveral acute sites. DIMENSIONS AND AREAS 9.13 The critical dimensions of an area are determined by the spatial requirements of any activities to be carried out within it. Studies to establish dimensionalrequirements, in the form of critical dimensions, appearas ergonomic diagrams in HBN 40 - 'Common activityspaces'. 9.14 Planning teams should have data available at the earliest stages of a project to enable the approximate9 Cost informationassessment of sizes involved. Areas used for the purpose of establishing cost allowances are listed on pages 48 to 53. These areas do not representrecommended sizes and should not be regarded asspecific individual entitlements. 9.15 The efficient planning of a building may necessitate a variation to the areas given. For example, in the refurbishment/conversion of older property: rooms tend to be larger than the areas given; some rooms may be too small or in the wrong location for efficient use; circulation space tends to form a larger than normal proportion of the total area. CIRCULATION 9.16 All internal corridors, small vertical ducts, spaces occupied by partitions/walls and other space for circulation, are costed in the DCAGs. Provision is alsomade for a 5% planning zone and 3% engineering zoneadjacent to the external walls. 9.17 Circulation figures included in the DCAGs are those anticipated for new-build facilities. Where constraints are encountered, for example in refurbishment/conversion ofolder types of property, this figure may increase. COMMUNICATIONS 9.18 Staircases and lifts are not included in the DCAGs. Costs related to these elements, along with a suitablespace allowance, should be made in the on-costs. LAND COSTS 9.19 DCAGs are exclusive of all land costs and associated fees. However, costs associated with landcosts should be included in business case submissions(as detailed in 'CIM') and may therefore have animportant impact on the overall cost viability of ascheme. ENGINEERING SERVICES 9.20 The following engineering services are included in the cost allowances (see chapters 5 to 8 and ActivityDataBase for further information). Primary engineeringservices are assumed to be conveniently available at theboundary of the department. 9.21 Mechanical services: Heating - low-pressure hot water system. Ventilation - mechanical supply to, and extraction from, all laboratory areas and other areas requiring mechanical ventilation such as WCs and showers(excludes ventilation plant, such as air handling unitsor extract fans). Cold water - central supply to service points including drinking water (excludes storage tanks). Hot water - supply from a central system (excludes storage and generation). Piped medical gases - oxygen, compressed air and vacuum (excludes medical compressed air andvacuum plant). 9.22 Electrical services: Departmental distribution boards.

haemoglobin and platelet estimation and cell counting using automated analysers (commonly referred to as blood cell counters); assessment of red cell sedimentation rates using automated analysers; blood specimens spread on slides and stained for microscopic examination (staining will be viaautomated processing); microscopic examination of blood specimens and bone marrow preparations (non-automated).The blood cell counter is a screening instrument thatanalyses blood cells and measures haemoglobin for avariety of haematological and physiological disorders.The basic methodology involves the application ofreagents to separate the different types of white and red blood cell. The method of analysis incorporating the whole blood count (WBC) measures several important parametersincluding blood cell structure and function. This is usedto evaluate the adequacy of oxygen delivery to thetissues and to detect abnormalities in cell size andshape, which may provide clues to a variety ofhaematological conditions.Appendix 1 - Automated haematology work Workflow for haematologySpecimens from pathology specimen reception Blood transfusion Blood group & cross-matching Specimens stored for timespecified by Royal College ofPathologists and, when notrequired further, disposed ofdirectly or after autoclavingAUTOMATED LABORATORYSPECIALISED LABORATORYCOLD ROOM GENERAL OFFICESome specimens stored under refrigeration SENIOR STAFF OFFICE(S) Despatch of reports to appropriate person and copy filedReporting & signing of reportsResults read, recorded & reportedTesting of blood specimen by automated processes for routine or emergency work Results read, recorded and reportedTesting of blood specimens by mechanical or manual processes and testing for coagulation disordersSpecimen sorted, labelled, numbered & batched 55HBN 15 FACILITIES FOR PATHOLOGY SERVICES 56Chemical pathgology includes the analysis of body fluids, such as serum, blood, cerebral cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and urine. Identification and monitoring ofphysiological changes and detection for the presence ofunusual substances are part of the discipline's remit. With current instruments, barcoded primary sample tubes are loaded onto analysers, and probes aspirate aminute portion of the sample and specific reagent(s) andmix within some form of reaction vessel. The reaction isthen measured, often photometrically, and the resultsallow for diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Applications include the diagnosis of liver, bone, thyroid and electrolyte complaints, the detection of drugs ofabuse, and measurement of the success of therapeuticdrugs.Appendix 2 - Chemical pathology work Workflow for clinical biochemistrySome specimens stored under refrigeration Preparation of chemicals and reagents Reporting and signing of reportsSpecimen from pathology specimen reception direct to pre-analysis SPECIMEN RECEPTION/PROCESSING COLD ROOM CHEMICAL STORE/PREPAUTOMATED LAB Specimen stored for time specified by Royal College of Pathologists and, when not required further, disposed of directly or after autoclavingSpecimen stored for time specified by Royal College of Pathologists and, when not required further, disposed of directly or after autoclavingSENIOR STAFF OFFICE(S) GENERAL OFFICEPreparation of batched specimens by centrifugation and the separation of serum Preparation processing of urine and faeces (use of fume cupboard required) Testing of blood, urine and other samples by automated processes for routine or emergency workTesting of specimens by special procedures Results read, recorded and reportedResults read, recorded and reported Despatch of reports to appropriate person and copy filedSPECIALISED LABSpecimens sorted, labelled, numbered and batched57Hospital microbiology is concerned with the diagnosis of human microbial disease by the detection of micro- organisms, antigens, antibodies or DNA in clinicalspecimens. Microbiology encompasses bacteria,parasites, fungi and viruses as infectious agents. Directmicroscopy of specimens may be used for rapiddiagnosis. Molecular diagnostic tests that detect specificDNA are becoming more widely used, particularly in thedetection of viruses and the bacteria that cause TB. Bacteriology involves the examination of clinical specimens for the presence of bacteria, parasites or fungi that may be causing disease. It involves thefollowing bench activities: preparation and staining of slides for microscopic examination; inoculation and plating out of specimens on appropriate culture media for the isolation and identification of bacteria or fungi; examination of cultures after overnight incubation; identification tests; antibiotic sensitivity tests; serum antibiotic levels.Virology is concerned with the diagnosis of viral disease. This is usually done by serological tests that demonstrate the presence of antigens and antibodies inserum samples. These tests can confirm past exposure,active disease or convalescent status of a viral illness.Most of this work is done in batches but may be urgent,for example HIV antigen/antibody tests in a sharps injurycase. Bench activities include: manual and automated serology tests; virus isolation by tissue cell culture (used less frequently nowadays); electron microscopy; molecular diagnostic tests.Appendix 3 - Hospital microbiology work Clinical science centre, Wythenshawe Hospital (Photo: Bob Collier)HBN 15 FACILITIES FOR PATHOLOGY SERVICES 58Workflow for microbiologyResults read, recorded and reportedTesting hazard group general incubation; identification; sensitivity testing; slide preparation, staining, microscope examination Specimens sorted, labelled, numbered and batched Bacterial and viral diagnostic serology testing: antibody assessment in blood and body fluids and antibiotic assays by manual or mechanical processes; microscopic examination; molecular diagnostic testing Specimens sorted, labelled, numbered and batched Inoculated blood in culture media bottles examined by manual or mechanical processes for organisms in blood.

Transferred to storage under refrigeration Media plates and bottles etc issued for use in laboratories61Most histopathology specimens are received fresh from operating theatres, out-patient clinics and post-mortemrooms. Formalin (a solution of formaldehyde gas in water) is used for fixing tissues. Some samples, including small biopsies, are delivered in formalin and may require examination as frozensections. Large specimens will need to be dissected.Selected portions of large specimens, or the whole of smaller specimens, are passed through automatic tissueprocessing machines overnight. This procedure may beassociated with the emission of fumes from formalin,alcohol and other solvents. Specimens are then commonly embedded in paraffin wax or resin blocks. After specimen processing and embedding, sections are cut from the cooled wax or resin blocks and floatedin a warm-water bath. These are then mounted on a microscope slide, de-waxed, and stained bymechanised or manual systems using routine or specialtechniques. Glass coverslips are applied manually or mechanicallyover the sections using stryrene mountant, and slidesare labelled. Frozen section investigations may be carried out on some specimens. This involves freezing a selectedportion of the unfixed tissue and cutting sections, which are then dried or fixed and stained. Certainimmunohistochemical techniques require this type ofprocedure. All stained slides are placed in trays for despatch to the pathologist for microscopic examination. Tissue remaining after the specimen has been cut up is stored until after the section has been reported. Fresh specimens (wet tissue) are stored in formaldehyde until four weeks after the final report has been issued(see Interim Guidelines for the 'Disposal of tissue blocksand slides from biopsies and surgical resections'(Bulletin of the Royal College of Pathologists , 121, January 2002)). Histopathology blocks should be kept for 30 years, and slides should be kept for a minimum of 10 years (see'Interim guidelines for the disposal of tissue blocks andslides from biopsies and surgical resections' ( Bulletin of the Royal College of Pathologists , 121, January 2002) for further details).Appendix 6 - Histopathology workHBN 15 FACILITIES FOR PATHOLOGY SERVICES 62Histopathology workflowRemaining tissue kept in ventilated storage Blocks processed CONSULTANT OFFICESPROCESSING HISTOPATHOLOGY LABORATORYInternal and external postSpecimens organised Blocks cassetedMicro Final reports printed Sections coverslippedSlide microscopy Slide microscopy (discussion) Slide microscopySpecimens dissectedSpecimen numbering Specimens registered Blocks embedded Reports generated Reports checked and signedReports sent out Reports checked and signedReports generated Sections checked and matched with formsREPORTING ROOMSECRETARIAL OFFICE Slide microscopy (discussion)Macro description entered Prelim reports printed Sections stained (routine) Sections stained (immuno)Sections stained (specials) FILING ROOM Slides returned for filingFrozen sections Resin sections Paraffin blocks cutSPECIMEN CUT-UPSpecimensSPECIMEN RECEPTION WET SPECIMEN STORE Request formsRequest forms EMBEDDINGMacroscopic descriptionCheck specimen details Blocks filed Slides filed63Appendix 7 - Cytopathology work Automated laboratories (housing haematology and chemical pathology), Manchester Royal InfirmarySpecimens will be received from the central specimen reception area. A proportion of specimens received will be fixed on slides. Others will be suspended in fluid and will need tobe spread onto slides or centrifuged before they aremounted and stained. Stained slides are dried in a small oven or incubator and then a glass cover slip applied using a coverslippingmachine. Stained slides will be viewed under a microscope by cytopathology staff and a report made. A proportion ofslides should be referred to a consultant for furtherexamination. Liquid based cytopathology (LBC) is a method of preparing cervical samples.LBC samples are placed in a vial of preservative fluid (atthe point at which the samples are obtained) instead ofbeing smeared onto a slide. Samples are then sent tocytopathology processing laboratories. Here theyundergo automated processing whereby they aretransferred from the liquid-based medium onto glassslides for staining. Screening is carried out as forconventional smears. All slides may have to be stored for many years. Cervical smears should be kept for 10 years (see 'Interim guidelines for the disposal of tissue blocks andslides from biopsies and surgical resections' ( Bulletin of the Royal College of Pathologists , 121, January 2002) for further details).HBN 15 FACILITIES FOR PATHOLOGY SERVICES 64Internal and external postMicro description entered Final reports printed Reports sent outSECRETARIAL OFFICE Slide microscopy Slide microscopy (discussion) Reports OFFICESCREENING ROOM Slide microscopy Reports checkedSlide microscopy (discussion) FILING ROOM Blocks filed Slides filedSpecimens organised Specimens processed, smears prepared and stainedSpecimen numberingSPECIMEN PREPARATION LABORATORYCheck specimen detailsSpecimens kept in refrigerated storageSPECIMEN STORE Specimens Slides returned for filing Slides returned for filingSlides coverslipped, labelled and sorted into cases, and sent to pathologistRequest forms Request formsSpecimens registered Reports signedSlides referred to pathologist Reports generatedPrelim reports printed Reports signedReports generated Cytopathology workflow65Blood transfusion involves blood grouping and cross- matching.
