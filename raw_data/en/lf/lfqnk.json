Our survival and well-being depend on plants and this dependence will increase as the climate changes rapidly. To improve how we obtain food, energy, and materials from plants and steward the health of our environment for future generations, we need to understand how plants work at multiple scales from molecules to cells to ecosystems. A major challenge to achieving this goal is a limited understanding of functions of plant genes. The majority of genes in plant genomes are uncharacterized and many of them are found only in plant lineages. Traditional sequence-similarity based biochemical function inference cannot address this challenge. Another aspect of gene function that is critical but generally lacking is the spatial and temporal context under which gene products operate. These challenges have, in part, driven the spectacular advances and inventions in genomics, imaging, mass spectrometry and we are now capable of high-throughput, high-content, and high-resolution measurements of gene and protein function parameters. Along with these technologies and emerging datasets, we need advances in computational biology and bioinformatics tools, concepts, and methods. In this talk, I will describe these challenges and some of the efforts we are making in addressing them. Perspective on Deep Imaging Ge Wang PhD Mar 05, 2020|12:00 PM - 1:00 PM 130 University Health Services Building (Pizza & drinks served at 11:50) Please RSVP to BMI@uky.edu Artificial intelligence is now recognized as an on-going paradigm shift, with an emphasis on machine learning especially deep learning. Computer vision and image analysis are two major applications of deep learning. While computer vision and image analysis deal with existing images and produce features of these images (images to features), tomographic imaging produces images of multi-dimensional structures from experimentally measured data (line integrals, harmonic components, and so on, of underlying images) which are tomographic features (features to images). Since 2016, deep learning is being actively developed worldwide for tomographic imaging, forming a new area of imaging research. In this presentation, we present a perspective on deep imaging involving data processing, image reconstruction, radiomics, and beyond. We show deeptomographic results and also explore network innovations. Slides from presentations: Accelerating Bioinformatics Applications using GPUs Fernanda Foertter PhD Feb 20, 2020|12:00 PM - 1:00 PM University Health Services 130 (pizza and drinks at 11:50 - RSVP to BMI@uky.edu) The biological sciences are currently experiencing an increase in data size and complexity. Traditional methods are now reaching the point they can no longer keep up with the data output. Larger datasets, particularly when combined with other data sources, open opportunities to apply methods like deep learning on these complex data. NVIDIA is contributing to these needs by developing algorithms that can leverage graphics processing units (GPUs). These problems benefit from high memory bandwidth and very high parallelism inherent of the GPU architecture. This talk will explore some of the collaborations we have with industry and academia and share some of what our research team is currently working on. Promoting Transparency in Biomedical Publications Using Natural Language Processing Halil Kilicoglu PhD Feb 06, 2020|12:00 PM - 1:00 PM 130 University Health Services Building, Please RSVP to BMI@uky.edu Rigor, reproducibility, and transparency of biomedical research has been the topic of much debate in recent years. Some ongoing efforts aim to address the issues in research conduct and dissemination by focusing on standardization and guideline development. As biomedical research output increases exponentially, automated tools are needed to complement such efforts and assist the stakeholders (e.g., scientists, journals, funding organizations) in assessing and improving research output. Textual artifacts (e.g., grant applications, study protocols, manuscripts, and publications) are central to biomedical communication. With the progress made in in biomedical language processing and text mining (bioNLP) in recent years, it is timely to ask if and how bioNLP techniques can be used to help address some of the rigor and integrity problems manifested in these artifacts. In this talk, I will motivate the use of bioNLP methods toward these goals by providing some use cases, and discuss a couple of tasks that I have recently pursued in this area: a) assessing clinical trial publications for reporting guideline adherence, and b) elucidating contradictory claims in biomedical publications. I will also highlight some of the challenges facing bioNLP research focusing on this area. Epigenomic insights of environmental disease Zhibin Wang PhD Dec 05, 2019|12:30 PM - 1:30 PM 130 University Health Services Building (Pizza & drinks served at 12:20.

CANCELLED - Deciphering the regulatory code of metabolism in Arabidopsis - CANCELLED Seung Yon (Sue) Rhee PhD Nov 07, 2019|12:30 PM - 1:30 PM Coordinated control of metabolic genes is crucial for plant development and adaptation to various environments. To discover general rules of metabolic regulation, we used omics data, machine learning, and experimental validation. To understand how metabolic genes are controlled by epigenetic marks, we mapped regulatory patterns of 16 epigenetic marks across metabolism in Arabidopsis and found a predominant regulatory pattern for specialized metabolic genes involved in controlling the precise timing of gene expression upon stimuli. To understand how transcription factors regulate metabolism, we constructed condition- and tissue-specific regulatory networks in Arabidopsis and identified patterns of transcriptional regulation at various levels. These studies elucidate metabolism coordination and contribute to developing toolkits for pathway engineering in plants. Reinforcement Learning for Brain Machine Interfaces Jihye Bae PhD Oct 17, 2019|12:30 PM - 1:30 PM 130 University Health Services Building There have been promising advances in brain machine interfaces. However, many challenges still remain before this technology can become practical. In this talk, we will discuss some of the main issues along with possible approaches to overcome them. In particular, methods to translate neural signals to control external devices using reinforcement learning will be introduced. Transforming Ontologies into Nested Facet Systems GQ Zhang PhD Sep 19, 2019|12:30 PM - 1:30 PM 130 University Health Services Building Irrespective of data size and complexity, query and exploration tools for accessing data resources remain a central linkage for human-data interaction. A fundamental barrier in making query interfaces easier to use,ultimately as easy as online shopping, is the lack of faceted, interactive capabilities. We propose to repurpose existing ontologies by transforming them into nested facet systems (NFS) to support human-data interaction. Two basic issues need to be addressed for this to happen: one is that the structure and quality of ontologies need to be examined and elevated for the purpose of NFS; the second is that mappings from data-source specific metadata to a corresponding NFS need to be developed to support this new generation of NFS-enabled web-interfaces. The purpose of this presentation is to motivate the concept of NFS, provide a preliminary order-theoretic formulation for NFS, and suggest topics for further investigation. Bacterial Outer Membranes and Interactions with Membrane Proteins Wonpil Im PhD Sep 05, 2019|12:30 PM - 1:30 PM 130 University Health Services Building (Pizza & drinks served at 12:20) The outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria is a unique asymmetric membrane bilayer that is composed of phospholipids in the inner leaflet and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the outer leaflet. Its function as a selective barrier is crucial for the survival of bacteria in many distinct environments, and it also renders gram-negative bacteria more resistant to antibiotics than their gram-positive counterparts. LPS comprises three regions: lipid A, core oligosaccharide, and O-antigen polysaccharide. In this talk, I will present our ongoing efforts to understanding various bacterial outer membranes and their interactions with outer membrane proteins. In addition, I will also present other research projects in my lab, such as the CHARMM-GUI development, a local structure-centric bioinformatics for drug development, and structure.
