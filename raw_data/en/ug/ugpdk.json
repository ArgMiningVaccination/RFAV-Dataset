Congenital rubella syndrome is caused by a virus known as a rubivirus. When adults and children contract the disease, it is known as [rubella](/conditions/rubella), or German measles. If a pregnant woman contracts rubella during her first trimester, there is a very good chance that she will pass it on to her fetus. There is also a chance that the infection will result in a miscarriage. Pregnant women who have been exposed to rubella need to seek medical attention immediately. Rubella is very uncommon now that children are vaccinated for the disease. Only 30 to 60 cases of are documented each year in the United States. Fewer than five infants each year are diagnosed with congenital rubella syndrome. The rubivirus does the most damage to a developing fetus during the first trimester. The developing fetus is especially vulnerable to illness because its immune system is not yet strong enough to permanently fight off infection. After the fourth month, the mother's rubella infection is less likely to harm the fetus. Babies who are born with congenital rubella syndrome may have severe [birth defects](/conditions/birth-defects-and-congenital-anomalies).

Congenital Rubella | Diagnosis & Treatments How we diagnose congenital rubella The first step in treating your child is forming an accurate and complete diagnosis. - For the mother: The skin lesions caused by rubella are unique, so usually a physician can make a diagnosis through a physical examination. Your doctor may also order blood or urine tests to confirm the diagnosis. - For the baby: If your child is born with congenital rubella syndrome, a simple blood test can detect the presence of the virus in the bloodstream. After we complete all necessary tests, our experts meet to review and discuss what they have learned. Then we will meet with you and your family to discuss the results and outline the best treatment options.
