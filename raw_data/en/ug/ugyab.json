These include: 1. A complete blood count 2. Blood type, RH factor, and antibody testing for blood cell antibodies 3. Blood testing for syphilis 4. HIV scr een 5. Screen for immunity to rubella (German measles) 6. Hepatitis B virus screen 7. Urine sample Rhogam: We will check your blood type at the beginning of your pregnancy. If you have an \"Rh negative\" blood type (A negative, B negative, AB negative or O negative), then you will need a shot of medicine called Rhogam at 28 weeks. We will check the baby's blood type after birth and give you an extra dose if the baby has an \"Rh positive\" blood type. We may also give extra doses during pregnancy if you experience any bleeding or trauma during the pregnancy. This medicine will prevent you from developing an immune reaction against your baby's blood type. If no Pap smear has been done in the past 3-5 years, this will also be done.Prenatal CareA Guide for Your Pregnancy > Prenatal Care Immunizations: Before becoming pregnant, a woman should be up-to-date on routine adult vaccines. This will help protect her and her child. Live vaccines should be given a month or more before pregnancy. Inactivated vaccines can be given before or during pregnancy, if needed. Flu Vaccine It is safe, and very important, for a pregnant woman to receive the inactivated flu vaccine. A pregnant woman who gets the flu is at risk for serious complications and hospitalization. To learn more about preventing the flu, visit the CDC website www.cdc.gov/flu. Tdap Vaccine Women should get adult tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) during each pregnancy. Ideally, the vaccine should be given between 27 and 36 weeks of pregnancy. Travel Many vaccine-preventable diseases, rarely seen in the United States, are still common in other parts of the world. A pregnant woman planning international travel should talk to her health professional about vaccines. Information about travel vaccines can be found at CDC's traveler's health website at www.cdc.gov/travel. Childhood Vaccines Pregnancy is a good time to learn about childhood vaccines. Parents-to-be can learn more about childhood vaccines from the CDC parents guide and from the child and adolescent vaccination schedules. This information can be downloaded and printed at www.cdc.gov/vaccines. It is safe for a woman to receive routine vaccines right after giving birth, even while she is breastfeeding. A woman who has not received the new vaccine for the prevention of tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap) should be vaccinated right after delivery. Vaccinating a new mother against pertussis (whooping cough) reduces the risk to her infant too. Also, a woman who is not immune to measles, mumps and rubella and/or varicella (chicken pox) should be vaccinated before leaving the hospital. If inactivated influenza vaccine was not given during pregnancy, a woman should receive it now because it will protect her infant. LAIV may be an option. A Guide for Your Pregnancy | 7Prenatal CareA Guide for Your Pregnancy > Prenatal Care Course of Prenatal Care: Pregnancy is a time of many changes, which can be both exciting and intimidating. As your care team, we want to help you know what to expect so you'll feel comfortable and informed. Below is a brief outline of what to anticipate during your pregnancy. We suggest that you refer to this handy reminder list periodically. First prenatal visit\u2014Here, a medical history is reviewed, a physical exam and laboratory tests are performed. The doctor will review some of the information in this packet, mainly that which you need to know early on. An ultrasound to confirm your due date may be performed. Visits will be about every 4 weeks until you are about 28 weeks pregnant. 11-12 weeks\u2014Usually can hear the heartbeat for the first time. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is done if indicated. 11-14 weeks\u2014First trimester genetic screen can be done only during this time period. 15-16 weeks\u2014Amniocentesis is done at this time if indicated. 15-18 weeks\u2014Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) Test or Multiple Marker AFP for Down Syndrome can be done. 18-22 weeks\u2014Mid-trimester ultrasound to evaluate fetal growth and anatomy. 24-28 weeks\u2014Blood test for diabetes, blood count and antibody testing (if Rh negative). A shot of Rhogam will also be given at about 28 weeks for Rh negative individuals. During this month, a brief survey will be given to you to screen for post-partum depression risk factors. Visits will now be every 2 weeks until 36 weeks, and then every week until delivery. 27-35 weeks\u2014Group B Strep Culture. Flu shot and Tdap wil be administered at this time as well. A full-term pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks. If you do not deliver by about a week after this date passes, your physician will discuss further testing, more frequent visits or induction of labor with you. Nutrition and Weight Gain: As you have probably noticed, your appetite has changed since you became pregnant. You still need a nutritious, well-balanced diet, but minor alterations may be needed. Once you overcome your nausea, you may be hungry more frequently, but you will feel full more quickly; thus, you will feel best if you eat small frequent meals and snacks. The absolute calorie requirement during pregnancy is only 300 additional calories a day, so try not to go overboard. Dietary requirements are similar to a typical food pyramid, but here are a few requirements that are unique to pregnancy: Your calcium requir ement is much higher\u2014about 1200 milligrams (mg) a day. An 8-ounce glass of milk has about 300 mg, a 4-ounce glass of calcium-fortified orange juice or 4 ounces of cottage cheese has 150 mg, and 1 ounce of hard cheese has about 175 mg. There are other great sources of dietary calcium, but if you are unable to get this in your diet, we do advise a supplement. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) re commends limiting certain fish intake during pregnancy, due to potentially high levels of mercury. You should completely avoid albacore tuna, swordfish, shark, tilefish and king mackerel. Limit chunk light or brown tuna to 6 ounces per week. All animal proteins should be cooked. Any red meat should be cooked to at least medium, and be sure pork and poultry are thoroughly cooked. A specific type of food poisoning called listeriosis (Listeria) is very dangerous to developing fetuses. Listeria is a harmful bacterium that can be found in refrigerated, ready-to-eat foods (meat, dairy), and in produce harvested from soil contaminated with listeria. It is recommended that you avoid all soft cheeses made from unpasteurized milk and cold deli salads and luncheon meats. If there is a listeria outbreak reported, avoid this food as well. If you think you have been exposed to listeria and feel ill (high fever, body aches, diarrhea), please contact your doctor.8 | A Guide for Your Pregnancy Prenatal CareA Guide for Your Pregnancy > Prenatal Care Advice A bout Eating Fish Wha t Pregnant Wom en & Parents Should Know THIS ADV ICE RE FERS T O FISH AND SHELLFISH COLLECTIVEL Y AS \"FISH. \" / ADVIC E UPDATE D JANUARY 2017For women of childbearing age (about 16-49 years old), especially pre gnant and breastf eeding w omen, and for parents and caregivers of young children.

A Guide for Your Pregnancy | 9Toxoplasmosis Precautions: Toxoplasmosis is a disease that can be transmitted to a pregnant woman and thus to her fetus. It has been found in cat feces, especially from outdoor cats. It is recommended that someone else clean and change the cat litter in your home if you own a cat, and you should consider getting tested for immunity to toxoplasmosis. This can also be transmitted through undercooked meat. Sexual Activity: Sexual activity is usually safe during pregnancy, but your physician may ask you to restrict sexual activity under certain circumstances. If you have vaginal bleeding, premature labor, premature cervical dilation or placenta previa, usually nothing is allowed in the vagina. Exercise: Most healthy pregnant women can and should exercise regularly. Regular exercise helps reduce pregnancy aches and pains, gets women in condition for the \"marathon\" of labor and can help keep weight gain in a healthy range. Be sure to stay well hydrated. Excellent forms of exercise include: Walking Biking\u2014stationary or recreational, not extr eme Swimming Prenatal exercise classes Yoga or Tai Chi Since you ar e pregnant, your joints and ligaments loosen and your center of gravity shifts. Falls as well as ankle, knee, hip and back problems can be triggered by an overly ambitious exercise program. We recommend caution. Due to balance and risk of injury, skiing and some competitive sports should be approached with caution and discussed with your physician. Under no circumstances should a pregnant woman go scuba diving.Prenatal CareA Guide for Your Pregnancy > Prenatal Care Exercise Precautions: If you develop severe shortness of breath, joint or back pain, abdominal cramping, or vaginal bleeding, stop the exercise\u2014this is your body telling you that you are overdoing it. Most pregnant women feel a little short of breath just from being pregnant, and some uterine crampiness during pregnancy is normal. Bleeding or painful regular cramping should be reported to your physician promptly. Women with high-risk pregnancies should discuss special restrictions with their caregivers. Also, avoid elevation of core body temperature, which can occur in hot tubs, saunas or with extreme, prolonged exercise. Environmental or Work Hazards: Please let your doctor know if you have any unusual hazardous exposure in the workplace, such as toxic materials or solvents. Some of these may be harmful to a developing fetus and may need to be avoided. If you suspect that your home is an at-risk area for toxic chemicals, you should arrange for an inspection. This is also a good time to make sure you have fresh batteries in your smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. Some professions may also pose risks, such as teaching young children. Please make sure that you have either had chickenpox or the vaccine, and if not, please stay away from school children if there is an outbreak. If you hear of an outbreak of Fifth Disease (also known as Parvovirus) let us know as soon as possible as this may have some risks that can potentially be prevented. This is an incomplete list\u2014please consider any hazards that may be in your environment. Travel: Whether for business or pleasure, many women will need to travel during their pregnancy. As long as no significant risks exist, this can be done safely until the last several weeks. One concern to remember is that high estrogen levels during pregnancy can increase the risks of blood clots, so prolonged sitting should be avoided. If in a plane or a car, make sure you get up every 90 minutes to stretch your legs and walk around. Airplane travel can dehydrate you, so drink extra fluids. A short trip is usually safe until one month before your due date, but be sure to avoid long trips after 32 weeks. If in the sun, use sunscreen. If in a warm climate, use bug spray with DEET. Your physician can give you more personalized instructions for specific travel needs.10 | A Guide for Your Pregnancy Prenatal CareA Guide for Your Pregnancy > Prenatal Care Tobacco, Alcohol, and Recreational Drug Use: If you smoke, the best advice is to quit. If you are unable to quit, cut down as much as possible. Smoking is detrimental to pregnancy and continued smoking after pregnancy is detrimental to your child via secondhand smoke. If your husband or partner is a smoker, both you and your child are being subjected to secondhand smoke, so they should also quit. We are happy to help you in any possible way. Alcohol is one of a few drugs proven to cause birth defects. There is no amount of alcohol that one can safely consume. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome has been known to result from as few as two drinks a day. Advise your physician about any alcohol that you have consumed to date and avoid it for the rest of your pregnancy. Recreational drugs are not safe during pregnancy. One marijuana cigarette contains several times the amount of cancer-causing chemicals as one standard cigarette, and cocaine has been shown to cause strokes in fetuses and induce premature labor. We don't want you using these substances, but we do ask you to be honest with us about their use. We are your advocates, and can help in many ways. Dental Work: It is okay to go to the dentist. You should in fact have normal dental care and get your teeth checked on a regular schedule. If you can avoid the first trimester, that is preferred. Gums can get swollen in pregnancy and are more likely to need regular brushing, and flossing helps. If you need x-rays, ask the dentist or dental technician to shield your abdomen. Hair Care: There are no studies that show harmful affects to hair coloring or perms. Waiting until the 2nd trimester is preferred. Medications: The following are recommended during pregnancy: Prenatal Vitamins: Can be either prescription or over-the-counter and should be taken once daily. A supplement of DHA\u2014a fatty acid\u2014also should be taken once daily. This is in some prenatal vitamins, but can also be found as a supplement (one brand is Expecta). Some women may need to take additional supplements such as iron, but we will advise you if this is necessary. Prescription Drugs: In general, you should avoid unnecessary medications. Almost any medication you take is passed on to your developing fetus, so we advise that you review any and all medications with your obstetrician at your initial visit (even better, review them with a pregnancy plan before you get pregnant). Any other prescribing physicians should be prescribing medications to childbearing-aged women only with a full review of potential risks during pregnancy, and plan for both planned and unplanned pregnancy. Do not either initiate or stop prescription medications during pregnancy without specific advice from the prescribing physician and/or your obstetrician. For some medications, there can be greater risk in stopping abruptly than in using them at all. A rating system used by the FDA categorizes risk of drugs during pregnancy in the following classes: Category Risk A Human studies indicate no risk. (Very few drugs have been formally studied) B No evidence of human risk; no controlled human studies. (Many drugs are in this category) C Risk to humans has not been ruled out. (Common with new drugs, this does not necessarily mean there is a problem.) D Evidence of risk to humans from human and/or animal studies. X Contradicted in pregnancy, known risks exist. Ther e are a number of problems with this categorization. Many class C drugs are widely used and one class X drug has been widely used to help prevent miscarriage, though that is not the drug's approved use by the FDA. A new system is being developed, but the current system gives physicians and consumers a general sense of a medication's safety for use during pregnancy. Specific medication questions can be addressed via TOXLINE, National Library of Medicine at (800) 638-8480, or several other online services. A Guide for Your Pregnancy | 11Prenatal CareA Guide for Your Pregnancy > Prenatal Care Over-the-Counter (OTC) Medications: Several OTC medications are generally regarded safe to take during pregnancy at standard doses. You may want to post the following table on your refrigerator for quick reference: Problem Medication Comments Acne Any standard OTC agent, Benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and Resorcinol can all be absorbed following instructions through the skin, but are not hazar dous in standard doses. Constipation Stool Softeners Minimally absorbed and okay to use on a regular basis. (Senekot, Metamucil) Some prenatal vitamins contain stool softeners. Docusate Sodium (Colace) Mineral oils and Castor oils Minimally absorbed, but could interfere with vitamin absorption if used regularly . Contact Cortisone Creams While cortisone is absorbed, the low concentration in OTC pr oducts makes these Dermatitis agents safe with standard use. Cough Dextromethorphan codein These agents are not associated with pregnancy pr oblems when used at (Robitussin DM) standard doses. Calcium Carbonate Heartburn (Tums, Rolaids) Use at moderate doses up to twice a day (1000 mg). Calcium Carbonate Supplemental calcium is an extra benefit. with Magnesium (Mylanta) Heartburn, Cimetidine (Tagamet). Widely used at higher than OTC doses for women with ulcers; reasonable levels Acid Reflux Ranitidine (Zantac), of OTC use is fine. Pepcid, Prilosec, Nexium Hemorrhoids (Preparation H, Anusol, Tucks) Hemorrhoids are common during pregnancy . A high fiber diet, plenty of fluid, and with or without hydrocortisone OTC products can be used to alleviate discomfort and bleeding. These can all be used safely as creams, ointments or suppositories. Minor Diarrhea Imodium AD, Standard OTC Use as directed. Nasal Pseudoepherine Commonly used decongestant not associated with congenital abnormalities. Congestion, (Sudafed) Class C, but extensive epidemiological studies do not indicate any problems. Allergies Can raise your blood pressure and may keep you up at night. Chlorpheniramine (Chlor-trimeton) No evidence that these drugs cause any problem at standard doses. Diphenhydramine (Benedryl, Class B. Antihistamines may Sprays Pain Acetominophen (Tylenol) No records of pr oblems during pregnancy with standard doses (up to 8x 500mg Fever <100.4 tablets/day). Overdose or use in conjunction with excessive alcohol can result in liver or kidney failure. Vaginal Y east Monistat Can be used during pregnancy; report unusual vaginal symptoms so your doctor can check for other infections if indicated. Avoid aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Bayer, Advil, Ibuprofen, Naprosyn, Aleve) as well Pepto-Bismol (contains aspirin) unless specifically directed for obstetrical reasons.12 | A Guide for Your Pregnancy Prenatal CareA Guide for Your Pregnancy > Prenatal Care Herbals: While herbal remedies have been widely used in many cultures for thousands of years, the manufacturing standards for herbs are not as tightly regulated as those for pharmaceutical agents. Therefore, the potential for contaminants and toxins is greater with herbal remedies than with pharmaceutical agents. We have no philosophic objections to herbal use, but it is probably safest to avoid herbal drugs during pregnancy\u2014and if you insist on using such drugs, do so under the guidance of an experienced herbalist who knows you are pregnant and use reputable manufacturer's products at recommended doses. Miscellaneous: Caffeine, \"diet\" drinks, aspartame, saccharine: While none of these items have nutritional value, there has been no indication that modest use poses any risk to pregnancy. Treatment of Common Medical Complaints: During this time, you may be so focused on the physical changes from pregnancy, you may forget that common illnesses and ailments may still occur. When you catch a cold or get a headache while pregnant, it's important to think about how to help yourself feel better and recover, but also how any remedies may affect your baby. The following are helpful guidelines for treating common ailments while pregnant. Colds: First line of treatment is fluids, a humidifier at your bedside, and lots of rest. It is alright to use recommended doses of acetaminophen (Tylenol) for aches and to keep your temperature under 100.4, Robitussin, Robitussin DM, or similar for congestion and cough, and simple decongestants as needed. Call us for advice if your temperature is 102 degrees or higher, the cold seems to be running an unexpectedly severe course, or if you have significant shortness of breath or wheezing. Women with asthma or lung disease need prompt care for asthma attacks not controlled by their usual medications.Constipation: Constipation is very common during pregnancy. It can be combated with lots of fluids, a high-fiber diet, and stool softeners such as Metamucil, Colace or Senekot. Avoid stimulants and cathartics as they can cause cramping. Some prenatal vitamins include stool softeners. Headaches: Headaches are common during pregnancy, especially at times when hormone levels may be very high (9-11 weeks) or your body is going through rapid fluid shifts (16-18 and 26-28 weeks). Staying well rested, drinking plenty of fluids, reducing stress and moderate acetaminophen use are sufficient for most women. Women with migraines should consult their physician about appropriate medications. Severe new onset headaches in later pregnancy can be a sign of preeclampsia, high blood pressure or even an impending stroke. Please call us immediately to report unusually severe or worsening frequent headaches, especially if you are close to term. Stomach Flu: Simple stomach upsets (commonly called \"the flu\") are characterized by aches, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Most of these illnesses do not pose unusual risks to the mother or fetus, and simply pushing fluids, taking acetaminophen for aches, and waiting a day to let it pass is fine. We do want you to call if you are unable to keep anything down for more than 24 hours (you may need intravenous hydration) and/or it seems like a more serious illness than the normal upset stomach. Viral Influenza: Viral influenza carries higher-than-usual risk of life-threatening complications in pregnant women, and may also cause premature labor and delivery. Therefore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a flu vaccine is given to all pregnant women, especially those with chronic medical conditions, immune system compromise, and individuals likely to be exposed occupationally or by household A Guide for Your Pregnancy | 13members. Flu vaccine may be given during breastfeeding. Contraindications to flu vaccine include allergy to eggs, and any active infection or unstable neurological condition. Please discuss the advisability of flu vaccine with your physician if you are pregnant during the months of September-December. Additional information can be obtained from the CDC at (800) 232-3228 or at www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/pregnant.htm. Nausea and Vomiting: The incidence of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy has been estimated at 80%. Although there are many theories, the exact cause is unknown. Symptoms usually occur around 7 weeks of pregnancy and usually begin to subside in the second trimester (after 12 weeks). Here are some helpful ideas you may consider: Temporarily discontinue your prenatal vitamin. Sometimes the vitamins can make the nausea worse. You should r esume taking vitamins when you are able to tolerate it. Do not allow yourself to become overly hungry or overly full. Eating smaller amounts more frequently may help alleviate nausea. Eat low-fat foods. Low-fat foods move through your body more quickly , which can reduce nausea and help your body get the nutrients it needs. This includes foods high in carbohydrates such as bread, cereal and potatoes. Avoid fast food and pizza. Food should either be very hot or very cold, lukewarm foods are not usually well tolerated. Drink liquids between meals and limit fluid intake during meals. Drinking liquid with meals makes the stomach expand and can increase nausea.Prenatal CareA Guide for Your Pregnancy > Prenatal Care Put plain crackers, popcorn, dry cereal or vanilla wafers in a container next to your bed. Eat something when you wake up, befor e you get out of bed. Get up slowly in the morning and avoid sudden movement. Avoid heavy spices such as garlic, pepper or chili. Avoid cooking odors. Eat high-protein snacks (meat, cheese, eggs) before bedtime to stabilize blood sugar . Sipping on Kool-Aid during the day and if you get up in the middle of the night may help. Drinking ginger tea or Ginger Ale may help. Take Vitamin B6 (50 mg 1-3 times daily) and/or Unisom (half a tablet every 12 hours). Take caution as Unisom may make you drowsy. If the symptoms are severe, contact your physician for medical advice. Foods which are usually well tolerated include: Animal crackers, bread sticks, dry cereal (excluding granola cereal), fresh fruit, frozen yogurt, fruit juice bars, graham crackers, hard candy (especially Sweet Tarts), hot baked potato, milk shakes made with yogurt and skim milk, plain hard rolls or French bread, plain toast, English muffins, bagels with a small amount of jelly, popcorn, popsicles, pop tarts, pretzels, rice, vanilla wafers, warm pasta with a small amount of parmesan, frozen slush drinks. continued >14 | A Guide for Your Pregnancy Prenatal CareA Guide for Your Pregnancy > Prenatal Care Ultrasound: Ultrasounds may be indicated at any time during pregnancy\u2014your provider will discuss this with you. An early ultrasound will often be done if dating of the pregnancy is uncertain, such as a woman with irregular cycles. Bleeding during pregnancy may also prompt us to order an ultrasound. We usually recommend one \"routine\" scan in the middle of pregnancy to assess growth, anatomy and placental location. High-risk conditions, unusual growth patter ns and multiple fetuses are some reasons for ultrasounds later on. Please note that only certain insurers will cover these tests. Make sure you know your insurance policy requirements. Additionally, we may recommend an ultrasound or any other test that your insurance company does not cover. These are still your financial responsibility, so please always know your coverage. Domestic Violence: Domestic battery is the most obvious form of abuse, but subtler forms can occur. These can include not allowing you to go out with friends or to doctor appointments without your partner, withholding financial support, not allowing you to function independently and emotional abuse. Abuse is often more severe during pregnancy and the immediate postpartum period. Please discuss any concerns with your doctor.Seat Belt Use: During your pregnancy, the lap belt goes across your waist and under your belly, and you should use the shoulder belt. If you are not already using seat belts every time you are in a car, now is the time to be 100% compliant. Although we know seat belt injuries can occur in an accident, the chance of a fatal accident is much higher without them. Depression: It is common for women to have emotional changes during and after pregnancy. These changes range from anxiety to mild or severe depression. Baby blues are mild changes in mood and are short lived. Depression, whether mild or severe, should be addressed. On rare occasions, depression can include psychosis. There is help available for any level of emotional change you may experience. At NorthShore, patients are screened twice; once during pregnancy and once postpartum. P lease let us know at any time if you are noticing any uncomfortable emotional changes. We have support groups, individual counseling and medication if needed. Our Hot Line number is 866.364.MOMS. A Guide for Your Pregnancy | 15Signs of LaborA Guide for Your Pregnancy Signs of Labor ?16 | A Guide for Your Pregnancy If you have never given birth before, you may assume that you will just \"know\" when the time has arrived to have your baby. In reality, onset of true labor is not always easy to identify, and events leading up to it can go on for days. Remember, too, that your due date is simply a point of reference\u2014it is normal for labor to start any time between three weeks before and two weeks after this date. So how will you know that labor is starting? First, you will need to understand the birth process. In a nutshell, here is what happens during labor: The uterus repeatedly contracts (tightens and relaxes), causing the cervix to thin (efface) and open up (dilate), so you can push your baby into the world. Calling Your Caregiver: Let your healthcare provider known when regular contractions are about 5 minutes apart. These may feel like your uterus is \"knotting up\" and be relatively painless at first, but gradually build in intensity, starting at the top of your uterus radiating through your belly and lower back. Your caregiver will want to know what other symptoms you're feeling, how far apart your contractions are, and whether you can talk during them. Also notify your provider if your bag of water breaks (either a large gush or a consistent small leak) or if you have bleeding similar to a period (or more). Once labor has started in earnest, when should you go to the hospital? Every situation is different, so talk to your caregiver well ahead of delivery day about the best plan for you. In general, though, expectant mothers should head to the hospital when their contractions are too painful to talk, last 60 seconds or more, and have been coming three-to-five minutes apart for at least an hour. If you're not sure, call your healthcare provider and talk about when to come in. Labor May Be Nearing if You Notice One or More of These Signs: Bloody show: If you have blood-tinged or brownish vaginal discharge, it means your cervix has dilated enough to expel the mucus plug that sealed it for the last nine months. This is a good sign, but active labor may still be days away. Signs of LaborA Guide for Your Pregnancy > Signs of Labor ? False Labor: Most expectant mothers feel mild contractions before they're actually in labor. These are called \"Braxton Hicks\" contractions. It can be hard to distinguish Braxton Hicks contractions from the real deal, especially if you're near your due date. If contractions aren't causing your cervix to dilate though, it's known as \"false\" labor. While true labor contractions get longer, stronger and closer together as time goes on, false labor contractions tend to be: Irregular: Braxton Hicks contractions are sporadic, have no predictable pattern, and usually stop if you rest or change positions. Felt in your belly and your groin: True labor contractions, on the other hand, usually \"wrap around\" from your back to your belly. If Braxton Hicks contractions are making you uncomfortable, take a warm bath and drink plenty of fluids to ease discomfort. Preterm Labor: Sometimes contractions cause the cervix to efface and dilate before 37 weeks of pregnancy. This is called preterm labor. A uterine or vaginal infection, or a host of other health problems, can bring on preterm labor. For unknown reasons, some women are more prone to it than others. The symptoms of preterm labor are similar to the symptoms of labor that begins at term. If you notice any of the labor signs listed above or feel strong, regular contractions before 37 weeks, call your caregiver right away. After examining you to see if your cervix is effecting or dilating, it may be recommended that you avoid intercourse, exertion and stress, and get as much rest as possible to stave off further contractions. In some cases you may be admitted to the hospital for observation or medications. A Guide for Your Pregnancy | 17Prenatal ScreeningA Guide for Your Pregnancy Prenatal Screening 18 | A Guide for Your Pregnancy Prenatal Screening A Guide for Your Pregnancy > Screening Carrier Screening Carrier screening is a test on you, the patient, to see if you are a carrier for any genetic mutations that you can pass on to the baby. Carrier screening is recommended to be offered to all women who are planning a pregnancy or are currently pregnant. Carriers generally have no symptoms and no family history of the specific condition. If you and your partner are both carriers of the same genetic condition, there is an increased chance for each pregnancy together to be affected with that condition. The following options are simple blood tests: Fundamental Panel\u2014Tests for three genetic conditions: Cystic Fibrosis, Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), and Hemoglobinopathies (red blood cell disorders such as sickle cell anemia, Beta-thalassemia, or Alpha-thalassemia). In general, the risk of being a carrier for cystic fibrosis is about 1 in 25 and the risk of being a carrier for SMA is about 1 in 50. Expanded Panel\u2014Tests for up to 176 genetic conditions with a wide range of severity, including all the conditions tested in the Fundamental Panel. This panel is recommended for couples who want to have the most comprehensive carrier screening available or for couples who have at least one partner with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Individual Tests\u2014In certain circumstances, screening for individual conditions may be ordered, but in general panel screening is recommended. How to Obtain Carrier Screening Please let us know if you are interested in one of the carrier screening options listed above. These tests are run by an outside lab called Counsyl. Counsyl will be provided with your cell phone number so that they can contact you and let you know your out-of-pocket cost via text message. If you do not respond to their text message within 48 hours of their notification, they will automatically run the test and you will be responsible for the out-of-pocket cost. Ideally, prior to screening, you can contact Counsyl directly at (888) 268-6795 to get an estimate of your out-of-pocket costs for this screening. Here are some important things about carrier screening that you should know: You only need to do this testing once in your lifetime. If you have been tested before and know the results\u2014you do not need to repeat the test. However, as technology improves, we may have the ability to offer screening for new conditions. If carrier screening is desired, our group believes that it is of \"medical necessity\" that all of our pregnant patients, regardless of their ethnic or racial background, should at least receive the Fundamental Panel. If you are of Ashkenazi Jewish background, the Expanded Panel is the \"medically necessary\" test that you should receive. You may start with only testing yourself. If you are NOT identified as a carrier, then the risk of your baby being affected is extremely low, and the father of the baby does not need to be screened. If you test POSITIVE as a carrier for a condition, it does not mean that your baby will be affected. However, the next step will be testing the father of the baby to see if he is a genetic carrier of the same condition. If he is found to be a carrier of the same condition, there is a 25% chance the baby will be affected. This will be the risk for any future pregnancies as well. In rare cases, you may still be a carrier of a condition even though your testing results were normal. For example, testing for cystic fibrosis through Counsyl is 99% sensitive, meaning that if testing is negative, you can be 99% sure that you are not a carrier. Genetic Testing In general, there are three types of tests offered to assess your baby's risk for a genetic condition: carrier screening, prenatal genetic screening, and prenatal diagnostic testing. Some are done by outside labs and not performed by NorthShore. As such, each of these requires independent insurance verification to see if you are covered. You may choose to have any of the genetic testing or screening options, however insurance may not cover all of these tests. For more information about prenatal screening and testing options, please feel free to consult your healthcare provider or call the Genetic Counseling Office at (847) 570-2864. A Guide for Your Pregnancy | 19Prenatal Genetic Screening You have the option of screening to see if your baby is at higher risk for an abnormality in the number of chromosomes such as Down syndrome. The normal number of chromosomes is 46. With prenatal genetic screening, we can screen for up to five of the most common disorders of chromosome numbers: Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21) - 47 chromosomes Trisomy 18 - 47 chromosomes Trisomy 13 - 47 chromosomes Turner Syndrome - 45 chromosomes Triploidy - 69 chromosomes The following are screens. It is important to know that screening cannot give you a yes-or-no answer. Instead, it tells you whether the fetus is at low risk or high risk for the condition. If you are found to be at high risk, there are other tests that are available to you to provide a definitive answer (prenatal diagnostic testing). It is generally recommended that a woman only have one, not all, of these screens during pregnancy. The screens that are available are as follows: Non-Invasive Prenatal Screening (NIPS, also known as Panorama)\u2014This test can be done as early as 10 weeks to screen for the five most common chromosome disorders. It involves a simple blood test and measures fetal DNA that is in your blood stream. It poses no risk to you or your baby. It is 94-99% sensitive, and you may also be able to determine the sex of the baby based on the results. If you weigh more than 200 lbs., there is an increased chance that the lab may not be able to get enough fetal DNA to run the test, and you may need to repeat the test or do a different test. The blood test can be done at any NorthShore outpatient lab and requires paperwork provided by your healthcare provider. The CPT code for the test is 81420 or 81507, depending on your insurance plan. You may contact the performing lab Natera at (650) 249-9090 if you have additional billing questions. Nuchal Translucency Ultrasound and First Trimester Screening (BUN Screen)\u2014This test can only be performed from 11 weeks 3 days until 13 weeks 6 days gestation to screen for three chromosome disorders (Down syndrome, Trisomy 18, and Trisomy 13). It involves an early ultrasound to measure the skin fold thickness of the fetal neck and to determine the presence of a nasal bone, as well as a finger stick blood test from you to measure three chemical markers. This test has a sensitivity of 90-96%. It also poses no risk to you or the baby. The Prenatal ScreeningA Guide for Your Pregnancy > Screening CPT codes for the ultrasound portion of this test are 76813 and 76801, and the CPT codes for the blood portion of this test are 84163 and 84704. Quad Screen\u2014This test is done between 15 to 21 weeks to screen for Down syndrome, Trisomy 18, and spina bifida. It involves a simple blood test and involves no risk to you or the baby. The test has a sensitivity of 60-75%. The CPT code for the test is 81511. Insurance Coverage These tests may or may not be covered by your insurance. Some insurance plans cover all the tests, some may cover one or two of the tests, and some do not cover any of them. Medical insurance plans are specialized and unique and are dependent on what your specific employer negotiated and contracted as part of your coverage. It is up to you to learn whether these tests are covered by your insurance. When it comes to insurance coverage for pregnancy, the following statements are generally observed, but are not true for everyone across the board: The BUN Screen and Quad Screen are generally covered by most insurance plans regardless of your age. NIPS is often covered by insurance plans if you will be 35 years or older at the time of delivery. NIPS may be covered by your plan even if you are younger than 35\u2014you will need to call your insurance to determine coverage. NIPS, If You Are Under Age 35 NIPS may be covered by your insurance even if you are younger than 35 years. You need to call your insurance company and ask whether NIPS (CPT code 81420 or 81507, depending on your plan) is covered for you. Some insurance companies will ask for a letter stating \"medical necessity\" in order to cover the NIPS test. We will issue a letter stating medical necessity for the following conditions: Moms 35 years or older at the time of expected delivery (due date) Abnormal BUN Screen or Quad Screen Abnormal ultrasound Prior pregnancy with an outcome of abnormal chromosomes If you do not meet one of these conditions, we can issue a letter stating it is \"medically appropriate\" for you to have NIPS as a prenatal screen. If you would like to pay for NIPS on your own, we can order the test for you and you can call the company that performs the test (Natera) to discuss payment options at (650) 249-9090. continued >20 | A Guide for Your PregnancyPrenatal ScreeningA Guide for Your Pregnancy > Screening Diagnosis Codes When checking on insurance coverage, you can use the following diagnosis code that is appropriate to you: Z34.90\u2014If you are less than 35 years oldO09.529\u2014If you will be 35 years or older at the time of delivery How to Obtain Prenatal Genetic Screening Please let us know that you are interested in receiving one of the prenatal genetic screening tests. NIPS\u2014This test can be ordered either by your provider or a genetic counselor. You will be required to bring paperwork with you to the lab. Let your provider know if you are interested in this screen, and they will provide you with the paperwork or refer you to genetic counseling. BUN Screen\u2014Your provider will place an order for the test and you will need to call Fetal Diagnostics at 847-570-2860 to schedule the ultrasound and blood work. Be prepared to tell them your estimated due date and they will give you a range of dates and locations. You will meet with a genetic counselor at the time of this appointment. Quad Screen\u2014This blood test can be drawn at a routinely scheduled prenatal visit between 15-21 weeks. No other arrangements need to be made. continued > Prenatal Diagnostic Testing Developed for pregnancies at \"high risk\" for a chromosome abnormality or other genetic disorder, diagnostic testing can provide a yes-or-no answer about whether the fetus is affected. Women who are considered at \"high risk\" to have a baby with a chromosome disorder include women who will be 35 years or older at the time of delivery, women who have had an abnormal screening result (NIPS, BUN, or Quad Screen), and pregnancies in which abnormalities are identified on ultrasound. Diagnostic testing is considered invasive, and therefore there is an increased rate of miscarriage associated with these procedures (0.3-0.5% risk). Diagnostic tests for chromosome abnormalities include: Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)\u2014This procedure is performed between 10-13 weeks of pregnancy. During the procedure, a small sample of the placenta is removed under ultrasound guidance. The cells from the placenta can be studied to analyze the fetal chromosomes. There is a small increased risk of miscarriage associated with CVS, which is thought to be approximately 1 in 200 (0.5%) above the background risk of miscarriage in the first trimester. Amniocentesis\u2014This procedure is performed after 15 weeks gestation. During the procedure, a small sample of amniotic fluid is removed with a needle under ultrasound guidance. The sample contains fetal cells floating in the amniotic fluid, which can be studied to analyze fetal chromosomes. There is a small increased risk of miscarriage associated with amniocentesis, which is thought to be approximately 1 in 300 or less (<0.3%) above the background risk of miscarriage. In addition to testing fetal chromosomes, the amniotic fluid can also be tested to measure the amount of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), which can detect the presence of open neural tube defects (such as spina bifida). Any woman may elect diagnostic testing if desired, regardless of being at a high or low risk. If you are interested in a CVS or amniocentesis, your provider can place an order for you and you must call 847-570-2860 to schedule the procedure. On the day of the procedure, you will also meet with a genetic counselor.

Most women get the baby blues after they deliver. Because they are so common, the baby blues are considered a normal part of the postpartum experience. A woman experiencing the baby blues feels mostly happy, but also may experience the following symptoms: Mood swings Crying for no particular reason Irritability Exhaustion Restlessness Anxiety This typically begins about 3-4 days after delivery and lasts for up to two weeks. The suspected reason for getting the baby blues is that your body and mind are making you more emotional so that you can bond with and take care of the baby. Symptoms of baby blues that do not get better after two weeks or so\u2014or become worse over time\u2014are more likely a sign of postpartum depression or anxiety. What is postpartum depression? Women can experience depression during and after pregnancy. Depression after pregnancy is called \"postpartum depression\" and can start anytime during the year after delivery. Women with depression during pregnancy or postpartum may feel some of the following symptoms most of the day for at least two weeks: Irritability or Crankiness Trouble sleeping even when you have the chance to sleep Trouble concentrating, r emembering things or making decisions Frequent crying Loss of appetite, or overeating Withdrawal from family and friends Loss of pleasure or interest in things you used to enjoy Not feeling like yourself Showing too much, or not enough, concern for the baby (not bonding or forming an attachment) Some women may also experience thoughts of harming themselves and/or their baby. For some women the thoughts come and go; for others the thoughts may be more serious and may require help. Frequently Asked Questions about Mood During and After Pregnancy continued > A Guide for Your Pregnancy | 23Do women also experience anxiety during pregnancy and postpartum? Most women experience some degree of anxiety about becoming a mother, but some women develop anxiety disorders during this time. Women may experience: Panic attacks So much worrying or nervousness that you can't do day-to-day tasks Compulsive behavior like excessive cleaning and hand washing Fears of intentionally or accidentally harming the fetus or baby How long does depression or anxiety during pregnancy or postpartum last? This greatly depends on how quickly women seek treatment.

A woman with postpartum psychosis may have times when the symptoms seem better . Postpartum psychosis is an emergency and it is important to get help as quickly as possible by calling 911 or going to the nearest emergency room. Why do women get depression or anxiety during pregnancy and postpartum? There are many theories about what causes depression or anxiety during and after pregnancy. Research suggests that some women may be naturally more vulnerable to becoming depressed or anxious when they are experiencing the stressors of adjustment to pregnancy or motherhood. Other women may be vulnerable to depression or anxiety as a result of the hormonal changes that occur in pregnancy and in the postpartum time, regardless of their stress level. continued > continued >24 | A Guide for Your PregnancyIf women have a history of depression, what are the chances of getting postpartum depression? Women with a family history or personal history of depression or anxiety have an increased risk of developing postpartum depression or anxiety.

A Guide for Your Pregnancy | 25Cord Blood A Guide for Your Pregnancy Cord Blood 26 | A Guide for Your Pregnancy Cord Blood Stem Cell PreservationA Guide for Your Pregnancy > Cord Blood What is cord blood? Cord blood is the blood remaining in your child's umbilical cord following birth. It is rich, non-controversial source of stem cells that must be collected at the time of birth. What are stem cells? Stem cells are the building blocks of our blood and immune systems. They are found throughout the body including bone marrow, cord blood and peripheral blood. They are particularly powerful because they have the ability to treat, repair and/or replace damaged cells in the body. Why do families choose to bank their newborn's stem cells? Today, cord blood stem cells have been used in the treatment of nearly 80 diseases. Banking your baby's stem cells guarantees the cells will be available to your family should you need to use them. Cord blood is also being used in emerging treatments, for diseases like Type 1 Diabetes and Cerebral Palsy, which require a child's own cord blood. Stem cells from a related source are the preferred option for all treatments, and transplants using cord blood from a family member are more likely to be successful than transplants using cord blood from a non-relative (i.e., a public source). How is cord blood collected? The collection process is safe, easy and painless for both mother and baby and does not interfere with the delivery. After the baby is born, but before the placenta is delivered, a medical professional will clean a 4 to 8 inch area of the umbilical cord with antiseptic solution and insert a needle connected to a blood bag into the umbilical vein. The blood flows into the bag by gravity until the umbilical vein is emptied. The blood bag is clamped, sealed, labeled, and shipped by courier to a processing lab. The collection itself typically takes about 2 to 4 minutes. Who can use my newborn's stem cells? Your newborn's stem cells have the potential to be used by the child, and, if there's an adequate match, by siblings and sometimes parents. An adequate match using related cord blood is defined as a 3 of 6 HLA Match. When two people share the same HLAs, they are said to be a 'match' which means their tissues are immunologically compatible. Your newborn's cord blood will always be a 100% for him or herself and there is up to a 75% probability of a match for a sibling.How long do cord blood stem cells last? Stem cells have been shown to be viable after more than 20 years of storage and the FDA does not require cryopreserved stem cells to have an expiration date. When stored in an undisturbed manner using liquid nitrogen vapor storage tanks, the stem cells do not age. If preserved and stored correctly, these cells are likely to be useful indefinitely. What are the odds of having a stem cell transplant? It is estimated that 1 in 217 people may need a stem cell transplant by the age of 70 using stem cells from the umbilical cord or bone marrow. The odds that someone would use the cells for regenerative medicine have been estimated to be 1 in 3. How much does it cost to preserve cord blood with a Family Banks? Generally, the cost for cord blood stem cell preservation has a one-time charge of about $2200 and an annual storage fee of about $125. Some companies offer payment plans and gift registries to help make banking affordable. What is cord tissue banking? Cord tissue banking is an additional service that some cord blood banks offer. Cord tissue, used with cord blood in transplant, has shown to improve engraftment in preclinical studies. Cord tissue stem cells also have the potential to treat additional disorders, like stroke, lung cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis. Some banks offer 'bundle and save' options when you bank both cord blood and cord tissue.

A Guide for Your Pregnancy | 33Your Body After Baby: Stay Fit and In ControlA Guide for Your Pregnancy > Postpartum After having a baby, it's natural for all focus to be on the newborn, the new center of your universe. But it's important to remember your body has just gone through a major physical event. Did you know that between 30 to 50 percent of moms report some loss of bladder control by age 40? Or that 25 percent of women notice some change in sexual function after six-months postpartum? These are problems that can diminish quality of life at home, in the bedroom or at work. And in most cases, these problems are preventable. Now is the best time to take control of your body and optimize your pelvic and core fitness, starting with a better understanding of \"what's going on down there\". Pelvic Floor: A group of supportive muscles and connective tissues that keep your pelvic organs (uterus, bladder, bowels) in their proper positions. A strong and healthy pelvic floor helps you maintain control over your bladder and bowels, and helps you to feel normal \"tone\". Even during a 'normal' pregnancy and delivery, the pelvic floor undergoes enormous strain and can become stretched and weakened. After childbirth, it's important to rehabilitate your pelvic floor. What Happens When the Pelvic Floor is Injured or Weak? Pelvic Organ \"Prolapse\": Weakened tissues can lead to a feeling of looseness, \"dropping,\" or pressure in the pelvic area and vagina. Perineal Injury: The perineum is the skin and muscle just below the vaginal opening. It has a lot of nerve endings and is sometimes affected by childbirth and/or episiotomy, leading to \"looseness\" or tenderness. Stress Urinary Incontinence: Accidental urine leakage occurring at the moment of a cough, sneeze, exercise or physical exertion. This impacts nearly 50 percent of moms by age 40, and if you have it\u2014 don't worry, just get help. Over 90 percent of cases can be completely cured. Overactive Bladder (\"OAB\"): Strong urges to urinate, frequent trips to the bathroom and, sometimes, leakage. Do you \"map\" the next bathroom when you're out of the house, anticipating the next sudden urge? If so, you may have OAB, a highly treatable condition. Sexual Dysfunction: Sexual changes after childbirth are common and often resolve with time and healing. But if not, there is help to be found, starting with a pelvic floor assessment. We are her e to help. If you have any of the above issues, please follow up with your physician. 34 | A Guide for Your Pregnancy Reprinted from Reproductive Health Access Project / June 2016 How well Method does it work?
