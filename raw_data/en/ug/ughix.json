This is a space where you can receive informed, safe, compassionate and unconditional support from Dr. Sarah Sue, whether in an office office, a virtual office session, classroom setting, at a birth or on a \"healing hike\" in nature. *Although Dr. Sarah Sue holds a doctorate in naturopathic medicine from Bastyr University in Seattle, WA, she is currently not practicing as a licensed naturopathic doctor. Therefore, any care received from Dr. Sarah Sue is not intended as a substitute for the care of a licensed healthcare professional. Naturopathy - Naturopathic medicine is unique as it addresses root-causes, prevention, treating the whole, rather than the parts, stimulating the body's innate ability to heal, person-centered medicine, founded in nature, science and clinical experience. Included is the \"Detective Work\" of physical exam, ordering preventive & diagnostic lab testing in order to discover what is going on within the body that may be at play with symptoms and illness. I have had the opportunity to support people through many health issues, from reactions to food allergies, hormone balancing and gut healing to lifestyle support with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune conditions, addiction, anxiety, and chronic pain. In my experience, it is not so much the conditions that claim the experience, but the process with my patients. Each approach, treatment plan and relationship is unique to the person whom I work with. The medicine is participatory, respectful, compassionate, enlightening and takes into consideration the whole being, rather than the health issue at hand. Coaching - This is a space where client & I explore what is truly needed for healing. This is where the care becomes individualized. Often, it can look like a conversation, exploration and education, to support the healing and growth that you seek. These moments often require some change to occur - in lifestyle, mindset or removing an obstacles along the way. This work is often rooted in building a deeper relationship with self, building emotional intelligence, creating meaningful changes, learning healthy communication, making and honoring boundaries, honoring rites of passage past & present, and navigating difficult life circumstances. It is where I get to empower you along your journey ~ to educate, train, inspire, counsel, mirror back, create connections, witness and hold space. Medicine Managing - supplement and medicine reviews, safe and therapeutic dosing guidance, education on actions and side effects, quality assessment, guidance to safe, sustainable and effective medicines. Are you wanting to fully get informed on safety, efficacy and therapeutic benefit of a new medicine you have heard of, or have recently been prescribed? This includes all forms of medicines ~ natural and pharmaceutical. Get informed by someone who has studied and learned about them all. Mind-Body Medicine, Soul Work, Ancestral Trauma & Healing Facilitator - Often, the biggest obstacles to cure lie on the mental, emotional and spiritual realms, as well as along the family lineage. These services are \"root cause\" medicine. It is important to be able to connect with oneself, have awareness and tools to calm down the nervous system, connect to soul / spirit, heal from past and generational trauma, heal ancestral trauma and patterns that have been passed down, develop skills to deeply listen and connect to oneself, and have agency and power in one's life. These sessions, and tools, deeply support these processes. One of the things I honor most about this work is getting to hold space, witness and support. Bodywork - Craniosacral therapy, visceral manipulation, myofascial release, lymphatic drainage, chakra balancing and other energy work. Learn more about craniosacral therapy [here](/blog). Herbal Medicine - Herbs are my passion. They are my friends. I hang out with them in my free time. I speak to them, sit with them, listen, learn and love them. I am inspired to share this passion, and all the medicine it provides, with my clients, students and attendees of classes and plant medicine walks. This can look like a personally formulated herbal tincture or flower essence blend, creative incorporation of medicine (food and herbs) into meals, taking a \"healing hike\" with me, education on herbal medicine gathering and processing one's own medicine, to teaching about the higher realms of plant medicines through stories, folklore, plant spirits, and flower essences. Stage of Life Support - \"Doula\" in ancient Greek means \"one who serves.\" Today, it is meant for someone who serves during the birthing process ~ prenatal, labor, postpartum. It also includes those who serve in the wake of loss ~ abortion, miscarriage, stillbirth, and infant death. It also is a term for those who serve in the final passage, as a death doula. All of these processes are significant rites of passage, where doulas are there to serve. I serve those in the prenatal stage, labor, postpartum as well as in the wake of grief and loss. I teach birthing classes to help prepare birthing bodies for the rite of passage into parenthood, focusing on the birthing process as well as postpartum care and early parenthood wisdom and lessons. [Contact me here](/contact) if you are interested in attending my birthing classes. \"Sarah Sue is an incredible healer, teacher, and guide to connecting soul, mind and body. This was very clear in how she taught her birthing class series which helped me as a first time mom and trauma survivor to feel safe, calm, and prepared for the arrival of my daughter. The information was invaluable. The way it was shared helped me and my partner to trust ourselves and receive the guidance we needed to build our foundation as parents. I am extremely grateful to have had this experience attending her birthing classes and having her as my doula, and would highly recommend Sarah Sue to anyone seeking a doula and/or the birthing class she teaches.\" -JW Teaching and Education Engagements (AKA workshops) Online or in person - [view my upcoming events here](/workshops) or [contact me](/contact) to plan your own workshop with Dr. Sarah Sue testimonial \"Dr. Sarah Sue has many tremendous healing gifts and she brings them all to the table in creative and special ways.

How does an ND practice medicine different from a conventional doctor (MD)? Naturopathic Doctors (ND) are trained as holistic primary care physicians with a unique skill set and philosophy. As NDs, our goal is to help individuals heal from illness, whether acute or chronic, and no matter how minor or severe. We understand that the body has complex and intelligent systems in place to return to wellness. Sometimes, there are obstacles to these processes. Our job as physicians is to stimulate healing in the most gentle and effective way possible, by incorporating the combined medicinal knowledge of our ancestors, scientific discovery, clinical experience and commitment to continuing training and education. Naturopathic Doctors have an expansive therapeutic tool box, unlike that of any other medical professional. This large field of medical and therapeutic expertise means we have the right tools at our disposal for every individual with whom we work. "}
