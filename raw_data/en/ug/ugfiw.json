The inoculations being rolled out now require two doses, and people are supposed to get two shots of the same vaccine, weeks apart. Guidelines in Britain and the U.S. say the vaccines aren't interchangeable, but can be mixed if the same kind isn't available for the second dose or if it's not known what was given for the first shot. Participants in the British government-funded study will get receive a shot of the [AstraZeneca-Oxford University vaccine](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-12-30/oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-how-does-it-compare) followed by a dose of the [Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-01-08/pfizer-study-covid-19-vaccine-works-coronavirus-variant), or vice versa. \"This study will give us greater insight into how we can use vaccines to stay on top of this nasty disease,\" said Jonathan Van-Tam, Britain's deputy chief medical officer. He said that, given the challenges of immunizing millions of people amid a global vaccine shortage, there would be advantages to having data that could support more \"flexible\" immunization campaigns. Johnson & Johnson says its vaccine appears to protect against COVID-19 with just one shot COVID-19 vaccines all train the body to recognize the coronavirus, mostly the spike protein that coats it. The ones from AstraZeneca and Pfizer use different technologies. AstraZeneca's uses a common cold virus to carry the spike gene into the body. Pfizer's is made by putting a piece of genetic code called mRNA \u2014 the instructions for that spike protein \u2014 inside a little ball of fat. The British study is scheduled to run 13 months and will also test different intervals between doses: four weeks and 12 weeks apart. A study published this week on the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine [showed that it was about 91% effective](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2021-02-02/study-russia-sputnik-covid-vaccine-appears-safe-effective) in preventing COVID-19. Some immunologists credit the fact that the vaccine uses two slightly different shots, made with similar technology to AstraZeneca's. But the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines are \"so different that it's really hard to know if that would work,\" said Alexander Edwards, an associate professor in biomedical technology at the University of Reading in England. The sites will be run by the federal government. One will be at Cal State Los Angeles, the other at the Oakland Coliseum. Matthew Snape, the new study's leader at Oxford University, called for British volunteers over age 50 to sign up; scientists are hoping to enroll more than 800 people. If the vaccines can be used interchangeably, \"this will greatly increase the flexibility of vaccine delivery,\" he said in a statement. \"[It] could provide clues as to how to increase the breadth of protection against new virus strains.\" In recent weeks, Britain, the European Union and numerous other countries have been [hit with vaccine-supply issues](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-01-28/eu-covid-vaccine-short-supply-poor-rollout): AstraZeneca said it would dramatically reduce the expected number of doses it could deliver because of manufacturing delays, and Pfizer also slowed deliveries while it upgraded its factory in Belgium.
