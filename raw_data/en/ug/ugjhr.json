Background. SARS-CoV-2 has been known to cause multisystemic involvement, gaining entry through ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 receptors.COVID-19vaccine-associatedthyroiditiscasesarenowbeingreported. CaseReport.

She was managed conservatively without corticosteroids or beta-blockers, and her symptoms resolved. A follow-up revealed increasing TSH, and levothyroxine was restarted. Case 2. A 33-year-old man with a history of anxiety disorder on Sertraline, presented with a two-week history of palpitations, heat intolerance, and 10-poundweightlossaftertheseconddoseofBNT162b2(Pfzer-BioNTech)vaccine.Examinationrevealedanormalthyroidglandwithno tendernesswithelevatedthyroidperoxidaseandthyroglobulinantibodies.Ultrasoundshowedadifuselyheterogeneousthyroid with increased vascularity, suggesting silent thyroiditis. Follow-up revealed hypothyroid phase with high TSH for which levothyroxine supplementation was started. Discussion. COVID-19 vaccine-associated subacute and silent thyroiditis have occurred following all three kinds of available vaccines, characterized by an initial thyrotoxic phase, followed by a hypothyroidphase and a recovery phase. Hypotheses include an immune response triggering thyroid infammation or cross-reactivity with viral proteins. Conclusions. COVID-19 vaccine-associated thyroiditis is rare, but long-term monitoring of these patients is essential to ensure appropriate diagnosis and management of the potential hypothyroid phase. 1.Introduction Te novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has afected more than transmembrane protease serine-2 (TMPRSS2) re-ceptors for entry that are expressed widely throughout thebodyincludingtheendocrineglands.Hence,COVID-19canhave multisystemic involvement with a range of severity [2, 3]. Several efective vaccines have been introduced, and currently, mass vaccination drives are underway. Te inactivated vaccines use adjuvants such as aluminum saltsand toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists to increase the im-munogenic response to vaccination [4]. However, in ge-netically susceptible individuals, adjuvants may lead toautoimmune/infammatorysyndromeinducedbyadjuvants (ASIA syndrome). Possible mechanisms include disrupting the immunological balance and molecular mimicry-triggering polyclonal activation of B lymphocytes [5].Subacute thyroiditis following COVID-19 vaccination hasbeen described with ASIA syndrome and also followingmRNA and adenovirus vaccines that do not have anadjuvant. We report two cases of thyroiditis that developed soon after receiving the second dose of the mRNA COVID-19vaccine. Te article's objective is to create awareness aboutHindawi Case Reports in Endocrinology Volume 2022, Article ID 7604295, 4 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/7604295 a possible association between thyroiditis and the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. 2.Case 1 A 36-year-old woman with a history of right hemi-thyroidectomy for a benign thyroid nodule six years ago,presented with a 6-week history of progressively worseningleft-sided neck pain accompanied by palpitations and heat intolerance. She developed transient myalgia and neck pain after her frst dose of mRNA1273 (Moderna COVID-19vaccine). Her current symptoms started 2 weeks after re-ceiving the second dose of the vaccine. She had been eu-thyroidonastabledoseoflevothyroxineforthelast6years.Shedeniedanyhistoryofviralorrespiratoryillnesspriortotheonsetofsymptoms.Shehadnofamilyhistoryofthyroiddisordersorautoimmuneconditions.Laboratoryevaluationrevealed suppressed TSH at urgent care triggering a con-sultation with an endocrinologist, which took place in a fewweeks, by when her symptoms were spontaneously resolving. On physical examination, her heart rate was 88/min, the temperature was 37.7 \u00b0C, her blood pressure was 110/ 65, and her respiratory rate was 20/min. A neck exami- nation revealed an enlarged and tender left thyroid lobe.Tere was no palpable lymphadenopathy, exophthalmos,pharyngeal erythema, irregular heart rhythm, hep-atosplenomegaly, edema, tremors, or skin lesions. Labo-ratory investigations revealed a of less than0.01mIU/LwithafreeT4of1.8ng/dlontheupperlimitofnormal (Table 1). Antithyroglobulin, anti-thyroid per- oxidase, and antibodies to the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)wasnormal.Shewas diagnosedwith subacutethyroiditis.Levothyroxine was TSH andelevated free T4. Corticosteroid treatment was not rec-ommended given the mild nature of the symptoms. Hersymptoms gradually subsided over the subsequent fewweeks, and TSH levels started rising. LevothyroxinetherapywasrestartedwhentheTSHlevelincreasedabovethe normal range.3.Case 2 A 33-year-old man with a past history of anxiety disordertreated with sertraline presented with a two-week history of persistent palpitations, heat intolerance, and 10 pounds of weightloss.Hereportednopastorfamilyhistoryofthyroiddisorders. He did not have any history of COVID-19 in-fection and was vaccinated with both doses of BNT162b2(Pfzer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine) 4 weeks apart. Soonafterreceivingthesecondvaccinedose,hedevelopedahigh-grade fever at 102.5F, myalgia, and sore throat, whichpersisted for 2 weeks. Subsequently, he experienced palpi-tations, diaphoresis, and heat intolerance along with gen-eralized weakness. An endocrinology referral was triggeredashewasfoundtohavesuppressedTSHalongwithelevated CRP at his primary care provider's ofce (Table 1). On physical examination, his heart rate was 86/min, bloodpressure was 143/71, and respiratory rate was 18. A thyroidexamination revealed a normal thyroid gland with no sig-nifcant tenderness. He had no extrathyroidal features ofGraves'disease.RepeatlaboratoryinvestigationsrevealedanundetectableTSHwithnormalT3andT4levels.Additionallab investigations revealed elevated thyroid peroxidase andthyroglobulin antibodies but undetectable levels of thyroidreceptor antibodies and thyroid-stimulating immunoglob-ulin antibodies. An ultrasound of the thyroid showed a difusely heterogeneous gland with increased vascularity and no nodules. Te clinical features were consistent withsilent thyroiditis. Tere were a few large benign-appearslymphnodes,whichwereresolvedonfollow-upultrasound.His symptoms improved with NSAIDs without corticoste-roid treatment. Repeat laboratory evaluation 4 weeks laterrevealed elevated TSH and low free T4 suggestive of a hy-pothyroid phase. He was transiently treated with levothyr-oxinebecauseofseverefatigueandrelativebradycardiawitha heart rate of 50s. Levothyroxine was subsequently dis-continued as his TSH normalized. He currently remains euthyroid and asymptomatic without levothyroxine supplementation. 4.Discussion We describe two cases of thyroiditis associated with theCOVID-19vaccine,subacutethyroiditisforthefrstcaseandsilent thyroiditis for the second case. Both patients had aninitial thyrotoxic phase followed by a hypothyroid phasewhich Subacute and silent thyroiditis is a self-limiting thyroid disorder. Tey are more prevalent in women. Viral in- fections and immune-modulatory drugs have been impli- cated as etiological factors. Characteristically, they have aninitial destructive thyrotoxic phase, followed by a hypothy-roid phase and a recovery phase, leading to the normali-zation of thyroid functions [6]. Te endocrine system has been found to be involved in COVID-19, causing hypopituitarism, adrenal necrosis,pancreatic beta-cell damage, gonadal unknown, but thehypothesis involves an immune-mediated hormonalTable1: Laboratory test results. Case 1 Case 2 At TSH (0.35-4.94mIU/L) <0.01<0.01 entry into cells causing cell de- struction or cellular dysfunction caused by infammation[7, 8]. AlongwiththecommonvirusessuchasCMVandHSV, cases of thyroiditis have emerged in ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 that allow SARS- CoV-2 to infltrate human cells are highly expressed in the thyroid follicular cells [9]. A recent study by Muller et al. suggested silent thy- roiditis induced by COVID-19 occurs in an underlyingsetting of nonthyroidal illness in critically ill male patients.Tiswasusuallyfollowedbyapermanenthypothyroidphase[10]. However recent systematic reviews have demonstratedseveralcasesofsubacutethyroiditissecondarytoCOVID-19infection,amongstwhich92%presentedwithneckpainandthemajoritywerefemalepatients[11,12].Tissuggeststhatthyroiditis caused by COVID-19 infection can have varied clinical presentations. Additionally, an increasing number of cases of COVID-19 vaccine-associated thyroiditis are now being reported.Tesecaseshaveoccurredfollowingallthreekindsof available vaccines, inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine,mRNA-basedvaccine,andvector-basedvaccine.Mostcasesthat developed after the inactivated vaccine have been at-tributed to adjuvants, triggering adverse reactions in ge-netically predisposed individuals, and causing ASIAsyndrome [13-15]. In a case report of two cases of subacutethyroiditis postvaccination from Germany, symptoms wereattributed to the adenovirus vector vaccine and the mRNA vaccine. Both the patients had classic symptoms and fne- needle aspiration cytology showed lymphocytic infltrateand multinucleated giant cells consistent with subacutethyroiditis [16]. A few other cases have been described, including a 42- year-old female who developed painful hyperthyroidsymptoms fve days after the frst dose of the BNT162b2vaccine and required a short course of steroids and beta-blockerswithwhichhersymptomsimproved[15].Similarly,a 46-year-old female developed neck pain after the seconddose of the Moderna vaccine and was diagnosed to have subacute thyroiditis. She was managed with analgesics, oral steroids, and beta-blockers and was found to have normalthyroid function at follow-up [17]. Adenovirus-vector vaccines stimulate innate immunity sensors whereas mRNA vaccines encode the viral spike Sglycoprotein,causingapotentimmunologicalresponse.Tevaccine is formulated in lipid particles which enable thedeliveryofRNAintothehostcellstoallowexpressionoftheSARS-CoV-2 S antigen. Tis process elicits an immuneresponsetotheSantigen,whichprotectsagainstCOVID-19infection [18]. Te mechanism of postvaccination-associated thyroid- itis remains unknown. It has been hypothesized that vac-cinations may be responsible for producing an immuneresponse that triggers thyroid infammation in predisposedpatients. Another hypothesis includes the SARS-CoV-2spike protein, nucleoprotein, and membrane proteinwhich cross-reacts with thyroid peroxidase [19].Terehasbeensomerecentunderstandingregardingthe potential immune upheaval due to mRNA COVID-19vaccination and its role in causing myocarditis, particularlyin young men. Te mechanism may include molecularmimicrybetweenthespikeproteinofSARS-CoV-2andself-antigens, increased cytokine expression secondary to dys- regulated immune pathways, or an exaggerated immune response to viral mRNA [20]. In these two cases of thyroiditis after the mRNA COVID-19vaccination,althoughadirectcausalrelationshipcould not be established, however, no other causes could beidentifed and temporality with the administration of themRNACOVID-19vaccineisverystronglysuggestive.Upto10%ofpatientswithsubacutethyroiditisdeveloppermanenthypothyroidism. Hence, it is important that these patientsarefollowedlong-term[21].Overall,furtherdataareneededto determine the association between subacute thyroiditis and COVID-19 vaccinations. 5.Conclusion COVID-19 vaccine-induced thyroiditis can range from sub- acute to silent presentation and is a rare phenomenon.
