An exploration of rongo Mori (traditional healing system) was conducted to ascertain the importance of landscape in the process of healing. Eight rongo healers or practitioners took part in semi-structured narrative interviews from June to November 2020. Transcribed interviews were analysed using an interpretative phenomenological analysis and Kaupapa Mori techniques. The findings show how rongo is underpinned by a complex set of cultural values and beliefs, drawing from the connection to wairua (spirit), tinana (body), tikanga and whakaora (customs and healing), rkau (plants), whenua (landscape) and whnau (family). Incorporating such constructs into the landscape can foster our understanding of health and well-being and its implications for conceptualising therapeutic environments and a culturally appropriate model of care for Mori and non-Mori communities.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-12-31", "cleaned_text": "Adapting Traditional Healing Values and Beliefs into Therapeutic Cultural Environments for Health and Well-Being [https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19010426](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19010426) [Global Indigenous Health: Maintaining Health in )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-ijerph-19-00426), [2](#B2-ijerph-19-00426), [3](#B3-ijerph-19-00426)]. Traditional medical systems focus on the relationship between spirituality, healing, illness and landscape [ [4](#B4-ijerph-19-00426)]. Such systems are deeply influenced by history, environment, places, attitudes, philosophy and traditional healing practices [ [5](#B5-ijerph-19-00426)]. Scholars have attempted to investigate and characterise traditional medical systems through different health models and theories [ [6](#B6-ijerph-19-00426), [7](#B7-ijerph-19-00426)], healing approaches [ [8](#B8-ijerph-19-00426), [9](#B9-ijerph-19-00426), [10](#B10-ijerph-19-00426)] and alternative therapies and treatments [ [11](#B11-ijerph-19-00426), [12](#B12-ijerph-19-00426), [13](#B13-ijerph-19-00426)]. In addition, many theories and traditional healing practices have been researched based on traditional Chinese philosophies [ [14](#B14-ijerph-19-00426)], native American healing [ [15](#B15-ijerph-19-00426), [16](#B16-ijerph-19-00426)], Australian aboriginal practices [ [17](#B17-ijerph-19-00426), [18](#B18-ijerph-19-00426)], and Indigenous Mori of Aotearoa/New Zealand [ [19](#B19-ijerph-19-00426), [20](#B20-ijerph-19-00426)]. Although a wide range of views and opinions from Indigenous peoples were reported across these studies, some commonalities were identified. Many studies have identified a set of health practices and approaches embedded in the knowledge and beliefs of a cultural group, incorporating plant, animal and/or mineral-based medicines, spiritual techniques, healing techniques and exercises, often transmitted orally from generation to generation with the intent to solve health problems and maintain well-being [ [21](#B21-ijerph-19-00426), [22](#B22-ijerph-19-00426)]. However, in contrast, Western-based medicine places little emphasis is placed on cultural values and beliefs associated with healing and relegates the importance of place and landscape. [23](#B23-ijerph-19-00426)]. For the Indigenous people of Aotearoa/New Zealand, their relationship to the natural environment, both physical and spiritual, is the core of their health and well-being. The medicinal properties of Aotearoa/New Zealand's native plants have been used historically by Mori in the form of Rongo Mori (traditional Mori healing), which continues to this day. Rongo Mori (RM) is a holistic system of healing derived from Mori philosophy and customs [ [24](#B24-ijerph-19-00426), [25](#B25-ijerph-19-00426)] that has faced many challenges with colonisation, the Tohunga Suppression Act of 1907, for example, that aimed at replacing tohunga (traditional Mori healers) with Western medicine and Western trained medical practitioners. The effects of globalisation and urbanisation have put Mori cultural knowledge and traditions at risk of disappearing. However, a growing interest in traditional Mori medicine and Indigenous knowledge in the context of health and well-being is clearly noticed, leading to varying patterns of integration with mainstream medicine. [26](#B26-ijerph-19-00426), [27](#B27-ijerph-19-00426)]. As such, there is little room to encompass Mori cultural concepts such as holism, the impact of the whnau (family) and wairuatanga (spirituality), all intrinsic to Mori health and well-being. Traditional healing or traditional medicine has been practised to some degree in all cultures and societies to maintain health and treat disease or illness. This paper explores the views and contributions of Mori healers and seeks to ascertain their understandings and perceptions of RM. It aims to provide a valuable exploration of the cultural values and beliefs that support healing, health and well-being and the importance of landscape. 2. Rongo Mori [28](#B28-ijerph-19-00426)], Indigenous therapeutic practice is interdisciplinary, combining knowledge of botany, toxicology, chemical physics, biochemistry, and psychology, making it deeply grounded in the surrounding landscape. Landscapes hold great importance in individual health and well-being as well as the communal quality of life. Indigenous health is interdependent on ecosystems and the services that nature provides, emphasising that it is through the connection to the landscape and ecosystems that well-being is achieved [ [29](#B29-ijerph-19-00426)]. In this context, RM is a system of healing techniques and practices embedded in the cultural history of Mori. As a holistic approach, RM encompasses physical, cultural customs and beliefs, and spiritual methodologies passed down through generations [ [30](#B30-ijerph-19-00426)]. [31](#B31-ijerph-19-00426), [32](#B32-ijerph-19-00426), [33](#B33-ijerph-19-00426), [34](#B34-ijerph-19-00426), [35](#B35-ijerph-19-00426)], few studies mention the importance of self, body, place and landscape [ [36](#B36-ijerph-19-00426), [37](#B37-ijerph-19-00426), [38](#B38-ijerph-19-00426)]. Central to this understanding, three dimensions of Mori knowledge\u2014whakapapa (genealogy) as a way of knowing things, understandings of time, and the importance of the spoken word rather than visual representation\u2014are used to demonstrate how Mori identify themselves, conceptualise the body as an arbiter of interaction with the environment, and create landscape through place naming. The world is represented through oral narratives, tales, songs, customs, place naming, and rituals that impress ancestors and deities into the landscape so that a place and its knowledge cannot be separated. This forms the base of mtauranga Mori (Mori knowledge), developed over thousands of years based on the intricate, holistic and interconnected relationship with the natural world [ [29](#B29-ijerph-19-00426)], recognising as well the significance of intangible values and how landscapes shape cultural identity [ [39](#B39-ijerph-19-00426)]. Mori cultural perspectives are deeply rooted in views of hinengaro (mind), tinana (body) and wairua (spirit), which is vital to rongo healers [ [25](#B25-ijerph-19-00426)], who need to access whakapapa (genealogy), whnau (extended family) and whenua (land) as essential aspects for healing a person's health ( [Figure 1](#ijerph-19-00426-f001)). The complex intersection of people, place and 'nature-culture' relations highlights the dimensions of Indigenous life and how that affects health and well-being [ [40](#B40-ijerph-19-00426)]. [41](#B41-ijerph-19-00426)] believes that this relationship with nature is better observed in forests to learn about the natural environment and our place within it. Mori believe that mauri (life force) runs through everything, connecting us to our natural environment, described as taha wairua or the spiritual side or dimension [ [41](#B41-ijerph-19-00426)]. Interactions with divine, spiritual, and ancestral beings that are part of the natural realm foster the diagnosis of an illness through the surrounding landscape. However, this spirituality does not correspond directly to a Western understanding of spirituality; rather, it is seen as a world of connections that flows through that wholeness. As we are only one small part of a far larger ecosystem, Mori deem that humanity must maintain the health of our surroundings, and in turn, the natural equilibrium of all things [ [40](#B40-ijerph-19-00426)]. This connection to whenua (land) brings forth the importance of care within the Mori value system, which calls for humans to be kaitiaki (caretakers) of the mauri (life force) in each other and in nature [ [42](#B42-ijerph-19-00426)]. If we are in harmony with ourselves and our surroundings, then we are well [ [41](#B41-ijerph-19-00426)]. [30](#B30-ijerph-19-00426)]. As elder relatives, plants are seen as a link between humans and the sacred ancestors of Papatnuku (Mother Earth) and Ranginui (Sky Father) [ [43](#B43-ijerph-19-00426)]. Mori used their extensive plant knowledge to harvest and utilise the resources that Aotearoa/New Zealand's unique ecological systems offer. However, this relationship between humans and nature was always one of kaitiakitanga (guardianship) and aroha (love and respect) [ [41](#B41-ijerph-19-00426)]. The benefits of this relationship had to be reciprocal. Mori understood that the best way to take care of themselves was to take care of the natural world so that it could continue to support them and their children for generations [ [44](#B44-ijerph-19-00426)]. For instance, the incorporation of wairuatanga (spirituality), often in the form of karakia (chants), ensures that appropriate rituals and traditions are upheld before, during and after the healing process is conducted to maintain the balance between living and non-living things (McGowan, 2000). The importance of wairuatanga (spirituality) also explains the need for spiritual rituals before the collection and use of herbal materials [ [43](#B43-ijerph-19-00426)], another essential aspect of RM. [45](#B45-ijerph-19-00426)]. Historically, herbal remedies were applied through various methods, including poultices, steam baths, tonics, and teas [ [46](#B46-ijerph-19-00426)]. These treatments were used for numerous ailments and complaints both internally and externally by harvesting the leaves, sap, bark or roots from certain plants [ [20](#B20-ijerph-19-00426), [47](#B47-ijerph-19-00426)]. Currently, RM focuses on treating the illness at the source or on prevention entirely, rather than simply seeking to remedy the symptoms once they become evident [ [48](#B48-ijerph-19-00426)]. The emphasis is placed on strengthening family relationships and mental health as these elements are fundamental to a person's well-being and must be considered in conjunction for a patient to heal properly [ [25](#B25-ijerph-19-00426), [41](#B41-ijerph-19-00426)]. Health and well-being, as intertwined constructs, result from a subtle balance between mind, body and spirit [ [49](#B49-ijerph-19-00426)]. In this way, the treatment differs in its principle values from Western medicine. While the Western model concentrates on treating the symptoms, RM aims to heal by improving the mental, physical and spiritual well-being of a patient to generate awareness about maintaining a healthy equilibrium [ [50](#B50-ijerph-19-00426)] ( [Figure 2](#ijerph-19-00426-f002)). With rongo practices, effectiveness is not simply related to the chemical composition and pharmacological action of a plant, but mainly to the process that is conducted within the context of traditional healing [ [46](#B46-ijerph-19-00426)]. [24](#B24-ijerph-19-00426), [51](#B51-ijerph-19-00426)]. Despite that, an increase in Mori healing practices has been recorded [ [30](#B30-ijerph-19-00426), [48](#B48-ijerph-19-00426)], supporting the value of traditional ecological knowledge, giving indigenous, holistic understandings and approaches a new-found contemporary significance. 3. Materials and Methods [Figure 3](#ijerph-19-00426-f003)). Located in the south-eastern corner, 80 km northeast of the capital city of Wellington, the Wairarapa region is known for its sheep grazing and dairy farming. It has a long history of occupation by Mori tribes, namely Ngti Kahungunu ki Wairarapa and Rangitne o Wairarapa. The regional population steadily increased throughout the twentieth century, reaching 41,097 individuals in 2013 [ [52](#B52-ijerph-19-00426)]. The Wairarapa region has a total area of 5900 km2 (or 590,000 hectares), but the rohe (tribal boundaries) both Rangitne o Wairarapa and Ngti Kahungunu ki Wairarapa extends to more than 10,000 km2 (one million hectares) to include the north-adjoining Hawke's Bay region [ [52](#B52-ijerph-19-00426)]. From the recorded population, 51.5% are females (or 21,162 individuals) and 48.5% are males (or 19,956 individuals). Looking at the population distribution, the higher proportion of people are in the younger age groups (0 to 17 years) and the older age groups (50+ years), representing jointly 65% or 26,832 individuals. Concerning the major ethnic groups, 87% of the region's population identify as of European ancestry (or Pkeh), 17.5% as Mori and a smaller proportion of people have identified as Pasifika. Although the Mori population increased by over 15% between 2006 and 2013, this ethnic group represents 7173 individuals of the Wairarapa region's total population. 3.1. Process 3.2. Recruitment [53](#B53-ijerph-19-00426)]. Participation in this study was open to any that self-identified as Mori healers or rongo practitioners. Working with established Mori elderly health groups and through the general hap/iwi (sub-tribe/tribe) was found to be an effective approach to recruit participants. Two participants were known to the researcher, while the remaining participants were identified by friends' and associates' contacts. Information sheets were provided at the start of each interview. Eight interviews were conducted, where 75% were whine (women) and 25% were tne (men). The groups 50-60 (37.5%) and 60+ (25%). Historically, each iwi (tribe) may have different perspectives and knowledge, and hence, interviewing mana whenua (those who have ancestral relationships with a particular territory) within their rohe (tribal boundaries) would be the best practice [ [40](#B40-ijerph-19-00426)]. However, over 85% of Mori now do not live in their rohe [ [54](#B54-ijerph-19-00426)], so they are not mana whenua; instead, they are termed ng matwaka or taura (those who are settled in a different territory to where their tribal ancestors settled). From the 8 participants, 63% were mana whenua, while the remaining were ng matwaka with mixed whakapapa (genealogy). Participants practised a wide range of healing techniques within Rongo Mori. 3.3. Interviews [55](#B55-ijerph-19-00426)]. A questionnaire with 8 open-ended questions and 8 dichotomous (yes or no) questions was generated to guide the interviews. Participants were introduced to the aim of this research in understanding the connection between landscape and health and well-being through the importance of Rongo healing practices. The questionnaire was adapted after testing and discussion with Mori elders as part of an early pilot study. The questions covered healing practices, outdoor environments, future use and protection and general demographics ( [Table 1](#ijerph-19-00426-t001)). Interviews started with a pepeha (introduction) to establish the relationship between people that at that time did not have a bond and become part of the whenua (land) and of the mana whenua (those who have ancestral relationships with a particular territory). Interviews lasted between 45 and 60 min and were audio-recorded. [56](#B56-ijerph-19-00426)]. In recognition of this background, a kaupapa Mori approach was adopted with the intent to make a positive change [ [57](#B57-ijerph-19-00426)]. It is necessary to acknowledge that the lead investigator in this research has no Mori heritage but has a pre-existing relationship established over time with both local iwi (tribe) in the Wairarapa region. Further to that, authenticity and accuracy were secured through engagement with Mori academics and related professionals in the community of practice [ [58](#B58-ijerph-19-00426)], and, as a result, this research was peer reviewed by the Indigenous groups represented. Therefore, the knowledge gained must be returned for the benefit of those taking part and for the kaupapa, or topic of the research. This acknowledgement of sharing of knowledge was included in the information for participants and was discussed in some detail with the participants before the interviews. 3.4. Data Analysis [59](#B59-ijerph-19-00426)] as its emphasis is on hermeneutics, experiences and in-depth analysis. An essential aspect of the IPA analysis process is the interpretation by the researcher (of the interpretation provided by the participants) of their experiences. The IPA coding provides for a detailed line by line analysis of the experiences and interpretations of each participant, and the identification of themes and super-themes, while observing context, language used and content. This was initially undertaken within each transcript of the interviews by using a qualitative data analysis computer software package, called Nvivo, version 12 [ [55](#B55-ijerph-19-00426)]. [60](#B60-ijerph-19-00426)]. This method takes a traditional form of Mori narrative, drawing from and responding to the broader historical, social and political research contexts [ [60](#B60-ijerph-19-00426), [61](#B61-ijerph-19-00426)]. Through prkau (narratives, stories), Mori maintain connections to the land, such as through narratives about landmarks as ancestors of spiritual significance (e.g., a maunga, or mountain, that is tpuna, or ancestral, to a particular iwi or tribe, who has significant mana, or authority, and thereby confers mana upon his descendants). As a methodology, it assists the researchers in unpacking the wisdom contained in sacred landscapes by the ancestors and draws on kaupapa Mori principles and values to understand and interpret such narratives. [62](#B62-ijerph-19-00426)] and participants' experiences as the holders of this knowledge. In addition, care was taken with making connections with participants with the objective that this should accord with tikanga (protocols) [ [63](#B63-ijerph-19-00426)]. For instance, participants were generally located through iwi (tribe) or personal contacts of the researchers. Interviews were generally undertaken within the mantle of the hap or sub-tribe, often commenced with a mihi whakatau (official welcome speech), which included karakia (chants), followed by a process of whakawhanaungatanga (to establish and maintain relationships) with food sharing, and concluded with karakia (chants). The essential aspect of karakia (chants) was often reaffirmed in interviews. Its role was to 'clear the path' and provide protection for those taking part and 'lift the heaviness of those discussions' at the end [ [62](#B62-ijerph-19-00426), [64](#B64-ijerph-19-00426)]. As part of kaupapa Mori methodology, the principles and practice of hap (sub-tribe), and the culture, beliefs, language, pepeha (way of introducing yourself) and mtauranga (knowledge) of participants were recognised for the leading role they provided in this research. Te reo Mori (Mori language) was part of the research, and although the interviews were generally conducted in English, participants were free to use either language. [Table 2](#ijerph-19-00426-t002)) [ [65](#B65-ijerph-19-00426), [66](#B66-ijerph-19-00426), [67](#B67-ijerph-19-00426)]. It started with the first three stages of the process by coding transcripts, adding first-order themes and subsequently moving coded data to second-order themes, allowing consolidation and data reduction. The fourth stage included clustering groups of themes into a coherent thematic framework. Each step of this methodology involved revisiting earlier stages and re-examining how and why themes were grouped together to ensure consistency between codes and themes, especially in lower-order themes, to avoid premature grouping. Each major decision and stage of the study was discussed in detail by the authors and justified using previous literature. An audit process was used to document each step as well as personal considerations and impacts. Findings were assessed in terms of relevance to current and future theory and practice. [68](#B68-ijerph-19-00426)] refers to this process as a means of facilitating the development of a conceptual framework, while Holloway and Todres [ [69](#B69-ijerph-19-00426)] defend that 'thematicising' is a form of qualitative inquiry that can be conducted with several theoretical frameworks, including kaupapa Mori as reported by Ihimaera [ [70](#B70-ijerph-19-00426)]. Based on a te ao Mori (traditional Mori worldview), four fundamental elements of health, namely, taha hinengaro (psychological), taha wairua (spiritual), taha tinana (physical) and taha Whnau (family), are used to help clustering groups of themes [ [71](#B71-ijerph-19-00426)]. 4. Results 4.1. Wairua (Spirit) [20](#B20-ijerph-19-00426)], some participants established the connection with the natural order of things, particularly with one's mauri (life force) or sacredness, acknowledging that the same life force is present amongst all other things. Others mentioned the importance of wairua when communicating with their tpuna (ancestors) during a healing session. \"It's our tpuna [ancestors] that do all the work.... we are just the vessel.\"(participant 4, female) \"When healing, we connect to the whaiora's [patient's] ancestors to do the mahi [work].\"(participant 1, male) [6](#B6-ijerph-19-00426)] and instead was acknowledged to influence physical well-being. In addition, healers agreed that healing begins with an assessment of spiritual experiences and understandings. The spiritual connection was fundamental for the healing process as the healers' views were that the ancestors were responsible for the actual healing. This aligns with the Mori construct that humans are composed of tinana (body), wairua (spirit) and mauri (life force) [ [30](#B30-ijerph-19-00426), [72](#B72-ijerph-19-00426)], and healing energy originates from the spiritual level and moves through the healer's body and is then sent to the client [ [23](#B23-ijerph-19-00426), [51](#B51-ijerph-19-00426)]. All rongo practitioners accepted that illness comes when mind, body and life force are not connected. \"If the balance is uneven, and you don't have that out there in the environment, then you bring that balance back. You must do one thing before you even attempt to go in and start doing.\"(participant 7, female) \"Go into the nghere [forests] to get rongo, you must first ask Tn Mahuta [god of the forests and birds]. You must go through all those Atua [gods], earthquakes, volcanoes and seasons]. You go through the whole lot where ever it is that you have to go....\"(participant 2, male) \"Rongo is like a journey... it involves opening up to the mauri [life force] around you and allow that to come through you.... if your surrounding taiao [environment] is polluted, the healing is not going to work.\"(participant 5, female) 4.2. Tinana (Body) [73](#B73-ijerph-19-00426)]. Like the previous superordinate theme, most healers accepted that illness is the physical manifestation of the disconnect between mind, body and life force. Rongo practitioners defended that the link between mind and body is through emotions. Most believe that negative emotions are held, trapped, or stored in the body and manifest as disease, including the mental and spiritual layers. Such negative emotions can be the catalyst to problems in specific parts of the body. Many defended that emotions are the link between mind and body: \"If those bad emotions and thoughts are trapped in your body, they can cause damage... it's all to do with the connection of mind, body and spirit.\"(participant 1, male) \"It is when our hinengaro and wairua [spirit] are separated that disharmony and illness appear in our lives. That can take many forms, from unhappiness to physical malfunction.\"(participant 3, female) \"Our tinana [body] is stronger than you think, it has the power to heal itself.\"(participant 6, female) \"And with the karakia [chants], you put in that karakia what you need to be done for the tinana [body], for the mauri [life force], for the mana [authority or prestige] of your people. If the balance is uneven, then you must bring that balance back.\"(participant 4, female) [30](#B30-ijerph-19-00426)]. For most healers, that is accomplished by the body's instinctive urge derived from internal wisdom that fosters the healing potential. In addition, healers emphasised the importance of rituals and traditions, such as karakia (chants), to maintain the connection between mind, body and life force or spirit. Formally, karakia was performed by tohunga (healers) in all kinds of healing situations, and such knowledge was tribe-specific and never shared [ [74](#B74-ijerph-19-00426)]. The tradition of karakia remained an essential part of Mori society, and today is performed in different settings. 4.3. Tikanga (Customs) and Whakaora (Healing) \"Often, when somebody is unwell, I would feel whatever they have first in my own skin, you know... the quick I can make sense of it, better I can offer assistance.\"(participant 8, female) \"The first thing is to put the person at ease and get to know them.... so I can connect in with that whenua [land] and whakapapa [genealogy].\"(participant 2, male) \"Aroha [love and respect] is the most critical part of the healing process... oh yes, it needs to be with your patient...it is that love that helps with the healing.\"(participant 3, female) [51](#B51-ijerph-19-00426)], many healers reported numerous examples of healing that have a physical, emotional and mental impact on patients. The most common healing interventions referred to by the rongo healers included those at a spiritual level related to balancing energies, clearing fear and strengthening through belief [ [75](#B75-ijerph-19-00426)], but also those at a physical level with visible body ailments, thus illustrating the relationship-based treatment and holist nature of healing: \"So, I came here first, I stopped there dropped him off some rongo pain relief, so by the time I got back there after here, he hadn't chopped his leg off. We gauged it from Monday, by Wednesday he was fine, by Thursday it was still a bit tender, but he pushed it and by Friday he was running around. Saturday, he was going nightclubbing.\"(participant 5, female) \"I've got a two-year-old mokopuna [grandchild] that has had eczema since, I don't know, the word goes, of which we actually have to use rongo on him. Our children and their generation, they're actually turning towards rongo because they've studied to find out that mainstream medicine doesn't work, and it isn't fixing them, and they don't trust it.\"(participant 3, female) [43](#B43-ijerph-19-00426), [48](#B48-ijerph-19-00426)], the importance of mind, body and life force or spirit has become prominent over the last decades as a new underlying concept of holist healing. Nevertheless, the significance of knowledge, grounded in aroha (love and respect), was described as fundamental to assist health and well-being. Knowledge was seen as descending from ancestors and through to the current and future generations. Rongo healers were perceived as the protectors of knowledge, which meant that their health and well-being depended on the presence (or not) of Mori knowledge to assist with the healing process of others. 4.4. Rkau (Plants) [41](#B41-ijerph-19-00426)]. The bark, leaves, roots, berries and branches are carefully harvested, removing only what is needed and ensuring that nature could continue to accommodate harvesting in the future. The healers describe the complexity of the process: \"Rongo is a different world, you know, it has its own process and generally takes a day... it starts with a karakia [chants] at home and... there's more karakia [chants] while you walk the bush while you connect with the atua [gods] and with the rkau [trees, plants, herbs].\"(participant 6, \"It is of mauri [life force] and [emotional] stuff... noses] with the rkau [plants] as they've their own stories, you know, they're individuals like us.\"(participant 8, female) \"We get to know their [plants] whakapapa [genealogy], that's the connection we want to have...cause everyone can boil stuff but it's becoming tuned with the rkau [plants] that releases the full potential of it.\"(participant 7, female) [76](#B76-ijerph-19-00426)]. Plants are viewed as individual entities that are alive and can communicate their stories and genealogy to the healer. This relationship between healers and plants may be due to the belief of Mori healers in the ability of particular people to communicate with plants through their mauri (life force) [ [51](#B51-ijerph-19-00426), [72](#B72-ijerph-19-00426)]. In addition, when plants are taken, there is an acknowledgement of the spiritual world through karakia (chants) to give thanks. However, more importantly, there is also a recognition that the plants actively contribute to the healing process, even when preparing the remedies. \"Depending on how connected with the taiao [environment] you are, you know which leaves to pick first...even from which tree...doesn't matter the illness, the tukana [elder siblings, referring to plants] always have the right answers.\"(participant 1, male) \"Even though the mauri [life force] of the rkau [plants] is being taken, you know, it returns to become one with people... helping them [people] in their journey.\"(participant 4, female) \"We make our own pani [spread] for our own rongo and we utilise our native plants. For the pani, we use beeswax mainly. But, some whnau [extended family] are allergic to honey, therefore, they are allergic to beeswax. So, we use coconut oil as another source.\"(participant 7, female) [25](#B25-ijerph-19-00426)]. \"We've got marae clinics massage]. We also use native plants of our lands to make rongo, ah, for different ailments.\"(participant 5, female) \"We do honohono, you know, energy work, so we don't have to touch people at all... and whitiwhiti krero, which is about holistic well-being.\"(participant 8, female) \"We also do whnau mirimiri. We only touch the hands, the feet, and work the wairua [spirit].\"(participant 2, male) \"Mahi wheua, which is a realignment of the bones, but also gets rid of the uric acid in whnau [extended family], especially kaumtua [elders]. Um, it makes the blood flow so those crystals that crystallise around the bone don't get to stay there.\"(participant 6, female) 4.5. Whenua (Land) and Whnau (Family) \"Healing is a holistic thing, you're working with and for the whenua [land], once the whenua [land] is healed, then our people will feel better.\"(participant male) \"The whenua [land] grounds our know, 'cause some whnau [family] float around up in the sky. There's a time for that, aye. I'm not saying that, you know, that's not done, but there's time for that, we need to anchor, and we anchor in our tipuna [ancestors] and whenua [land]. Especially us when we go to do mahi [work].\"(participant 3, female) [77](#B77-ijerph-19-00426)]. In addition, participants mentioned that tikanga Mori (customs and traditions) acknowledges that individuals are inherently connected to one another, their surrounding landscape, and that one's self is but a part of the more outstanding landscape, and the landscape is part of one's being [ [58](#B58-ijerph-19-00426)]. Many rongo healers agreed that when the whenua (land), or the person, is damaged somehow, their mauri (life force) is also damaged or even lost. They agreed that their responsibility is to protect the whenua (land) and that the land can be healed, similar to healing a person [ [45](#B45-ijerph-19-00426), [72](#B72-ijerph-19-00426)]. [78](#B78-ijerph-19-00426)]. \"It's amazing what water can do in the spiritual realm for us as iwi. We have a true belief in this awa [river]... that keeps us safe, within that tapu [sacred] realm of our Mori tikanga [customs and traditions].\"(participant 1, male) \"You know, if you were feeling not so good, you went back to your land... You took yourself and your troubles back to the land.\"(participant 4, female) \"Our children are actually a bit more close to rongo than we are. I do find that it's taken time.\"(participant 8, female) \"Cause the kids go, 'aunty, we've seen that stuff work.' It ain't my stuff, it's our stuff. And as long as I'm picking those leaves from your whenua [land], it's your stuff.\"(participant 5, female) \"So, really, these things that we have learned, to reach a young person, you've got to come down to their level, not expect them to come up to you. You want to reach your mokopuna [grandchildren] or whoever and put it across and make it exciting. Who the hell wants to listen to an old person? Oh, please.\"(participant 6, female) 5. Discussion [79](#B79-ijerph-19-00426)]. While some of the results concerning spirit, body and mind are consistent with previous research [ [19](#B19-ijerph-19-00426), [25](#B25-ijerph-19-00426), [30](#B30-ijerph-19-00426)], emphasis is placed on the landscape as the mediator. This supports the notion that the whenua (land) is accepted as the arena where the connection between the healer and tpuna (ancestors) is established and the grounding place to engage with the whakapapa (genealogy) of the patient and the mauri (life force) of the rkau (plants). This conception of whenua (land) expands the existing ecological and biophysical understandings to accommodate the place-specific cultural and spiritual significance. As living with nature implies the guardianship of both land and people, places are seen as sacred [ [80](#B80-ijerph-19-00426)]. In this manner, health, healing and well-being are directly associated with a site or place. [81](#B81-ijerph-19-00426)]. The resultant bond formed from the landscape and the healing process explains why certain places or situations are perceived as therapeutic for rongo practitioners. In this regard, the principles of RM apply equally to healing the land as to healing those who are part of the land. [9](#B9-ijerph-19-00426), [27](#B27-ijerph-19-00426), [82](#B82-ijerph-19-00426), [83](#B83-ijerph-19-00426), [84](#B84-ijerph-19-00426)]. However, few studies explore the connection between the landscape and the health of people culturally associated with it [ [17](#B17-ijerph-19-00426), [85](#B85-ijerph-19-00426), [86](#B86-ijerph-19-00426)], mainly described as 'therapeutic cultural landscapes'. By understanding therapeutic cultural landscapes, key concepts can be amalgamated and lead to meaningful and reflective places. It was evident for rongo practitioners that the ideals inherent in these therapeutic cultural landscapes should not be seen as separate entities but part of a broader holistic system that caters to people's senses, emotions, and values. People's interactions with the land provide a spiritual connection; those connections cannot be gained through disenfranchised minds. The land cannot be healed nor managed with respect if the connections to it are jeopardised ( [Figure 4](#ijerph-19-00426-f004)). [10](#B10-ijerph-19-00426)]. In addition, many rongo healers referred to the need to re-establish the balance on the landscape, allowing the growth and harvest of rkau (plants) and preserving the tikanga (customs) around rongo. Similar concerns are shared in different fields of practice, including the built environment disciplines. For many researchers [ [84](#B84-ijerph-19-00426), [87](#B87-ijerph-19-00426)], a sense of coherence can be achieved through a salutogenic approach of connecting the individual, the group and the broader environment [ [88](#B88-ijerph-19-00426)]. A strong sense of belonging and coherence is reported when spaces are designed to foster a healthy balance of mind, body and spirit [ [89](#B89-ijerph-19-00426), [90](#B90-ijerph-19-00426)]. By restoring the land and acknowledging the significance of the site, we can aid the health of those drawing resources from the site. Such findings also align with other theoretical frameworks, such as topophilia (place attachment) and biophilia (innate human connection to nature). The more exposure people have and the more profound their immersion within the natural environment, the deeper their understanding will be, allowing them to heal themselves through this process. [41](#B41-ijerph-19-00426)]. However, a re-emergence in the interest of rongo offers opportunities for iwi (tribes), hap (sub-tribes) and whnau (family) to embrace their cultural identity and support the sustainable practice of rongo into the broader community. The importance of maintaining traditional values and beliefs within a contemporary context is fundamental as it permits to better comprehend the relationship between people and landscape and how the landscape can function holistically. For some, it is not \"not only culturally appropriate, but it is vital to Indigenous health, healing, and well-being in a new and changing world\" [ [30](#B30-ijerph-19-00426)]. Moreover, they should conserve and promote cultural heritage and build on natural features to inspire a deep connection to place and provide diverse habitats for appropriate species to enhance biodiversity and create safe and healthy places for connecting with others and recreation and mental relaxation. 6.
