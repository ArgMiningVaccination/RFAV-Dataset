Testimonials \"More Energy\" \"I credit Melinda for helping me regain freedom, energy and wellbeing; both physical and mental. I had suffered a few health complaints for several years that many traditional doctors couldn't alleviate; but Melinda made it happen. She's welcoming, honest and incredibly mindful of what is best for you... particularly with realistic timeframes and budgets. Melinda is the best!\" Gabrielle, Stylist and Art Director \"Improved Mood and Spiritual Awareness\" \"Throughout my sessions with Melinda, I have become aware of how deeply committed she is to guiding her clients towards healing. I leave my sessions lighter, mood shifted, unblocked and feeling a greater connection to universal energy.\" Sally, Teacher and Illustrator \"Reconnected to Intuition\" \"I feel so blessed to have found Melinda. Her loving kindness and sensitive awareness has allowed me to unveil and pursue a path that is lit by the trust and wisdom of my spirit. Melinda practices without judgement and holds the ability to delicately balance naturopathy with multifaceted holistic healing.\" Lily, Sustainability Manager \"Self-Discovery & Purpose\" \"Many years ago if I had been told of the journey I was to embark on when I began Melinda's sessions I would have struggled to believe it. I initially sought advice in regards to my diet and nutrition and the ways in which healthy living could be incorporated into my busy lifestyle. I had this reoccurring feeling that things were 'not quite right'. Melinda's approach was gentle yet informed. Beginning with my physical health, new concepts and ideas were translated in an inspired and accessible manner. I was looking for a purely physical solution but with Melinda's knowledge, help and support I have been able to journey to the centre of myself, to look at my life and begin to heal, to learn to love and embrace every element of my physical and emotional being. I take these discoveries and apply them to my everyday life, which is more joyful and inspired as a result.\" Emily, Film Locations Coordinator \"Committed to Self-Love and Healing\" \"I feel very blessed to have crossed paths with Melinda. I had recently experienced one of the most challenging times of my life, my energy levels were low, I had a variety of health issues, and strained relationships with various people. Initially I went to Melinda for a naturopathic consultation and discovered that everything is connected. Melinda delicately explained that my physical state was related to my emotional state. She has taught me to let go of many things and express love. I now try my hardest to express love, to practice daily affirmations and meditate. This, in addition to the naturopathic herbs I take are healing me physically and emotionally. I can honestly declare that all my relationships are mended, and my body and mind are in the process of healing too.\" Mary, Meditation & Life Coach \"Better Relationships and More Fun!\" \"I remember the first time when I started seeing Melinda there was a lot going on with me. With her guidance and immense love of her work today I'm a better me. I am a better Mum, my relationships with everybody has heightened to a new and fun-loving level. Melinda help's with what you are ready for. She is very intuitive, insightful and non judgemental, she is a guiding angel without wings. I absolutely love the work Melinda does and and I love her energy, thank God for having given me the opportunity to have met her.\" Nurdan, Mother of 3 & Spiritual Seeker \"Transformational Life Direction\" \"Melinda has been an enormous inspiration to me as I've been working my way through prerequisite coursework to get into medical school. I have been accepted into a four-year naturopathic medicine program at Bastyr University in Washington State (in the US). I am so happy and ready to start on this adventure. I'm tearing up a little, as Melinda's warm heart, generous help and great mind did truly inspire me to strike off on a different path, and I thank her for that.\" Lauren, Medical Student (USA) \"Soul Nourishment\" \"Melinda has helped me learn to trust my intuition and to set much needed boundaries. She has guided me through a number of challenges, for which I will be forever grateful. Her presence and gentle words are so nourishing to the soul you can't help but feel like you are on cloud 9 after just one session.\" Evette, Mother of 2 \"Deep Understanding of Healing\" \"You know what's rare? Walking into a room and feeling like the weight you've been carrying around for the last month has magically been lifted off your shoulders. That's how I feel every session. I'm quite picky when it comes to finding the right type of treatment and practitioner for me and I've spent years searching for someone who truly understands the things I'm going through, mentally, physically and emotionally. What makes our sessions so special is that Melinda's not afraid to share her own journey and health issues, which always helps me feel less alone in whatever it is I'm going through. The time I've spent with her has been eye-opening and beneficial in ways I can't put into words. She has a way of tapping into the energy that flows through us all, and on many occasions she has pointed out things that have previously eluded me. A beautiful human and talented healer: she is patient, centred, kind, non-judgmental and most importantly, completely honest.\" Nadja, Publicist \"Emotional Strength & Self-Forgiveness\" \"During my healing sessions with Melinda I felt as if an incredible weight had been lifted. More lasting was how emotionally and mentally stronger I felt, free of chains of old I had placed, and replacing with love and forgiveness of self. I have nothing but praise for Melinda, I recommend her highly for her sessions - placing you on your road to healing.\" Kim, Health Food Store Manager "}
