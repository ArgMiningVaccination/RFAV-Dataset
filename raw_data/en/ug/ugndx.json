The patient was an adopted three-year-old girl who was conceived at 28 weeks. She weighed 2 pounds, 5 ounces, and was born of a mother with a history of drug abuse. Following two years of abnormal behavior and multiple \"autism\" diagnoses from doctors, her foster parents chose to take her in for an intensive developmental evaluation. The three year-old failed vice critical tests: social/emotional, communication, cognitive, adaptive/self-help and sensory. A Child's life is changed by chiropractic Care The children's parents soon visited a nearby chiropractor, hoping he could provide them with solutions to severe problems. The chiropractor was tasked with reducing such symptoms as common neurological autism manifestations, unrelenting headaches, acid reflux, vomiting, sleeplessness and seizures. Subluxation-based specific chiropractic care was performed on the patient, which brought about total relief of her headaches, acid reflux, vomiting and sleeplessness within the month. Improvements in extreme autism-related issues were likewise noted. These included: calm behavior, increased eye contact, happier demeanor, improved attitude, increased focus and attention, and an initiation to sound out words. The tests report that the patient continued to advance as confirmed by an expanded vocabulary. Additional improvements were proven in her focus and disappearance of epileptic seizures. As indicated by her mother, the patient from this test has been \"off all of her medications, she's making improvements with her occupational therapists, speech therapists, even her pre-school teachers are noticing a big difference. I'm getting my little girl back - look, she's making eye contact with me, and even starting to say a few words! She'll use her hands to do the motions to the Itsy Bitsy Spider song!\" Her mom cannot express enough the impact that chiropractic care had on her daughter. Opinions from Natural Health Experts Dr. Matthew McCoy, a chiropractor, public health specialist and editor of the journal that published the study, explained, \"If you damage or compress or otherwise interfere with the neurological structures in the spine this can have far reaching implications on the functioning of the body. Through research reports like this we are finding that correcting the misalignments or abnormal motion associated with these spinal problems reduces the nerve interference and people experience improvement.\" Dr. McCoy continued, stating that, \"We believe that working together, chiropractors, MDs, occupational therapists, and other health care provides will see results by managing the root cause(s) and not just the various symptoms presented by ASD children.\" Explaining Vertebral subluxation \"Finding the cause of autism, and not simply masking the symptoms, is the most effective way of managing the disease,\" one author of the study explains. One such cause is believed to be spinal misalignments as well as unusual movement of the spine, named \"vertebral subluxations\" by chiropractors. This results in basic and neurological interference to the spine and central nervous system. It is this obstruction that may cause neuroendocrine occasions that prompt anomalous cholesterol metabolism. The theory suggests that once those spinal distortions are corrected, the body is better able to balance its physiology. In addition to this study, other researchers have discovered comparable outcomes with respect to diseases in the autism spectrum. They have noted autism to be more controllable with chiropractic adjustments, and this case is one of many studies detailing this treatment.
