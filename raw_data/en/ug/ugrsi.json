Introduction [1](#B1-children-10-00713)], in addition to headache and stroke [ [2](#B2-children-10-00713)]. Childhood epilepsies are a heterogeneous group of conditions with differing diagnostic criteria, treatment, and prognosis. It is characterized as recurrent, unprovoked seizures, involving sudden changes in behavior, including the loss of consciousness and sensory or motor disturbances. The International League Against Epilepsy states that epilepsy is diagnosed if one of the following three criteria are met: a patient has (1) 2 or more unprovoked seizures occurring greater than 24 h apart; (2) 1 unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after 2 unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years; or (3) a diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome [ [3](#B3-children-10-00713)]. Treatment involves anti-seizure medications (ASM); however, only about two-thirds of patients are seizure-free while on appropriate ASM. Epilepsy can lead to stigmatization and/or discrimination, and it is associated with increased morbidity (e.g., injury) and mortality [ [4](#B4-children-10-00713), [5](#B5-children-10-00713), [6](#B6-children-10-00713)]. Patients with epilepsy or their families may decide to use CAM for their condition for various purported reasons. [7](#B7-children-10-00713)]. Integrative medicine focuses on treating the whole person and utilizes appropriate therapies (including CAM), healthcare professionals, and other modalities to address the underlying cause of health problems and achieve optimal healing and health [ [8](#B8-children-10-00713)]. [9](#B9-children-10-00713)]. Patients or families may also turn to CAM as supplementary to conventional medicines (ASMs) due to religious beliefs [ [10](#B10-children-10-00713)]. Others may be more motivated to use CAM over conventional treatments as they believe that CAM aligns well with their values, beliefs, and lifestyle [ [11](#B11-children-10-00713)]. Suboptimal seizure control and a lack of access to conventional medical care are other reasons that may motivate patients or their families to seek CAM [ [12](#B12-children-10-00713), [13](#B13-children-10-00713)]. [14](#B14-children-10-00713)]. In industrialized countries, the percentage of users is also high (around 50%) [ [14](#B14-children-10-00713)]. As the popularity of CAM is high, there is a trend toward the integration of conventional medicine and CAM [ [15](#B15-children-10-00713)]. While many believe CAM treatments/therapies to be benign, side effects have been reported [ [13](#B13-children-10-00713), [15](#B15-children-10-00713), [16](#B16-children-10-00713)]. Herbal remedies, for example, have the potential to interact with ASMs. Herbs may also have intrinsic proconvulsant properties, thereby increasing the risk of seizures [ [16](#B16-children-10-00713), [17](#B17-children-10-00713)]. Therefore, patient-physician discussions on CAM usage are important to facilitate the safe use of CAM. 2. Materials and Methods [Figure 1](#children-10-00713-f001)): \"pediatric*[tw] OR children[tw] MEDLINE generated 193 results and CINAHL generated 201 articles. 3. Results 3.1. Literature Review [Table 1](#children-10-00713-t001). Of the thirteen studies, eight studies involved self-administered surveys to parents/caregivers and five studies involved structured interviews with the parents/caregivers. 3.1.1. Prevalence and Common Types of CAM Usage [Table 1](#children-10-00713-t001)) by geographic location, differing across countries and even in different states within some countries. [13](#B13-children-10-00713), [18](#B18-children-10-00713), [19](#B19-children-10-00713)]. The most commonly used therapy ( [Table 1](#children-10-00713-t001)). Based on the cross-sectional studies, the CAM prevalence in the international studies was reported to range from 13 to 100%, with common types of CAM being prayer, homeopathy, osteopathy, kinesiology, herbal remedies, acupuncture, diet therapy, and multivitamins. 3.1.2. Types of Commonly Used CAM - Natural products (Herbs/vitamins/supplements) [30](#B30-children-10-00713)]. [31](#B31-children-10-00713)]. While herbal medicine is popular in the United States, in other parts of the world, especially in developing countries, patients are also turning to herbal remedies for the treatment of their epilepsy [ [32](#B32-children-10-00713)]. The factors for the usage of herbal medications are multifactorial, varying from a lack of access to anti-seizure medications to cultural reasons, such as valuing traditional healers [ [33](#B33-children-10-00713)]. [17](#B17-children-10-00713)]. Kava and mistletoe had laboratory data to support the antiepileptic effects; however, they lacked clinical data support. As is the case for most herbal treatments, this lack of safety data and the potential side effects make it difficult to recommend it as epilepsy treatment. [15](#B15-children-10-00713)]. Many can alter cytochrome P450 enzymes and P-glycoproteins, leading to altered ASM levels. For example, borage oil is reported to carry pro-seizure effects and gingko biloba induces cytochrome P450, which can reduce the serum levels of drugs, such as phenytoin and valproate [ [34](#B34-children-10-00713)]. Herbal medicines also pose a risk as they may be contaminated by heavy metals [ [35](#B35-children-10-00713)]. A study conducted in Boston investigated 70 Ayurvedic herbal medicine products sold in stores and found that 20% contained potentially harmful levels of mercury, lead, and/or arsenic [ [36](#B36-children-10-00713)]. This raises the concern for potential heavy metal toxicity, which may increase the risk of seizures [ [37](#B37-children-10-00713)]. - 1a. - Traditional medicine [38](#B38-children-10-00713)]. More high-quality evidence is needed before clinical recommendations can be made [ [39](#B39-children-10-00713)]. [40](#B40-children-10-00713)]. Xiaocheng Yan's clinical experience collection of epilepsy is a text compilation of clinical cases, in which the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy using TCM were documented [ [41](#B41-children-10-00713)]. It is an important resource for TCM knowledge, and this medical record was analyzed. Commonly used Chinese medicinal herbs in the treatment of epilepsy were These herbs were reported to be effective in the treatment of epilepsy, all without side effects. Shihogyejitang (SGT), a herbal medication, was studied in Korea, in which a retrospective study of pediatric patients with drug-resistant epilepsy using SGT were analyzed [ [42](#B42-children-10-00713)]. Over 44% of the patients showed a greater than 50% reduction in seizures, with 24% being seizure free. Side effects, such as a skin rash and fever, were reported. [43](#B43-children-10-00713)]. After 4 weeks, there was a significant decrease in seizures, with 62.5% of the participants having a 50% or more decrease in seizures. This activity can be attributed to the presence of various bioactive components, such as flavonoids, polyphenols, and monoterpenes. [44](#B44-children-10-00713)]. [45](#B45-children-10-00713)]. [46](#B46-children-10-00713)]. Rhy may be a promising compound in drug development for epilepsy, and further studies are needed. - 1b. - Ayurveda [47](#B47-children-10-00713)]. [48](#B48-children-10-00713)]. [49](#B49-children-10-00713)]. [50](#B50-children-10-00713)]. [15](#B15-children-10-00713)]. Another consideration is that Ayurveda incorporates metals such as lead, mercury, and arsenic as adjuvants as ancient texts indicate that metals enhance drug delivery in the body. Patients may develop acute lead toxicity, as seen in the case of a 26-year-old man who took herbal medications regularly for his epigastric pain [ [51](#B51-children-10-00713)]. Ayurveda is highly utilized in Asia, and more laboratory and clinical research is needed. - 2. - Supplements/Pills [9](#B9-children-10-00713)] as the patients were not prescribed ASDs; however, the presence of ASD in CAMs was not verified through further testing of the product. Phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, and phenobarbital were among the ASD drugs detected on the serum work-up and the levels ranged from subtherapeutic to supratherapeutic. The study found that the most probable reason for the patients' loss of seizure control was the sudden withdrawal or overdose of ASDs content from the pills. It is unclear how an overdose of ASDs would cause seizures. This may have been mistakenly written. [52](#B52-children-10-00713)]. In a double-blinded, randomized control study, sixty children with ADHD and intractable epilepsy were enrolled and assigned to the omega-3 supplementation or placebo group in addition to antiepileptic drugs. The frequency and severity of seizures were assessed at baseline and monthly. Omega-3 supplementation was found to significantly decrease the monthly seizure frequency after 6 months compared to the baseline measurement before supplementation [ [53](#B53-children-10-00713)]. A meta-analysis on the use of omega-3 supplementation showed a beneficial effect on the seizure frequency in adults and children with epilepsy [ [54](#B54-children-10-00713)]. [55](#B55-children-10-00713)]. Seven products contained ingredients reported to have the potential to induce seizures, such as gingko, ginseng, black cohosh, evening primrose, ephedra, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and caffeine [ [55](#B55-children-10-00713)]. While this study was conducted on adult patients, younger patients may also be at risk of using similar products. [56](#B56-children-10-00713)]. [57](#B57-children-10-00713)]. - 3. - sclerosis [ [58](#B58-children-10-00713), [59](#B59-children-10-00713)]. The medical community and families of children with rare neurological disorders are also turning to pharmaceutical investigation and the development of CBD in hopes of finding new effective treatment. Other various cannabis products being used include medical marijuana and hemp oil. Cannabidiol (CBD) is widely available for purchase online or in stores and can be found in products of numerous forms, from gummies and drinks to shampoos and creams. The issue is that it is claimed to be CBD, but it is actually a mixture of several cannabis derivatives. As the interest in CBD products continues to rise, it is especially important to understand the current CBD research. Parents with children with refractory epilepsy are more likely to turn to CAM, particularly cannabis-related products, to attempt to control their child's seizures [ [13](#B13-children-10-00713)]. Children with early-onset drug-resistant epilepsy and a higher seizure burden tend to suffer from greater neurodevelopmental problems. Therefore, research on the safety and efficacy of cannabidiol would be particularly useful for pediatric patients with epilepsy. [60](#B60-children-10-00713)]. Consequently, scientific, and medical research on cannabis products such as marijuana dwindled. Currently, state laws differ regarding marijuana use recreationally and/or medicinally, with 23 states taking action for legal use. While there is past and current clinical trial research investigating the therapeutic usage of CBD in the field of epilepsy, more high-quality clinical trials are needed to understand the safety and efficacy of CBD usage in patients with epilepsy that do not qualify for the use of Epidiolex. - 3a. - Pharmacology of Cannabinoids [61](#B61-children-10-00713), [62](#B62-children-10-00713)]. THC is widely known for its psychoactive effects that create a feeling of being \"high,\" whereas CBD is non-psychotropic and therefore ideal for medicinal use and research. Research on THC and CBD is difficult as there is much variability in the plant product content and strains due to various growing techniques and processing. Furthermore, these products lack pharmaceutical quality control and other regulatory processes that ASMs are typically subjected to. - 3b. - Mechanism of Cannabinoids [63](#B63-children-10-00713)]. - 3c. - Data on the use of cannabis in children with epilepsy [64](#B64-children-10-00713)]. [65](#B65-children-10-00713), [72](#B72-children-10-00713)]. Acupuncture may act on the thalamus, which plays an integral role in epilepsy generation and propagation. In acupuncture, the \"Dazhui\" acupoint (GV14, the depression between the 7th cervical and 1st thoracic vertebra along the posterior midline) has been shown to inhibit pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced epilepsy activity in the ventrobasal thalamic neurons [ [70](#B70-children-10-00713)]. [73](#B73-children-10-00713)]. Adverse events reported to be associated with acupuncture are pneumothorax, central and/or peripheral nervous system injury, infections, syncope, organ and/or tissue injury, and hemorrhage [ [74](#B74-children-10-00713)]. - 5. - Chiropractic care [75](#B75-children-10-00713)]. This suggests that chiropractic care may be a potential non-pharmaceutical approach to pediatric epilepsy; however, further scientific studies are needed to investigate the effectiveness of chiropractic treatment in children with epilepsy. With spinal manipulation in chiropractic care, especially of the upper spine, the most common serious adverse events were due to vertebral artery dissections [ [76](#B76-children-10-00713)]. - 6. - Religious and Cultural Practices [77](#B77-children-10-00713)]. The literature has described the various patterns of use among the different countries in that region. [10](#B10-children-10-00713)]. Religious beliefs (68%), fathers older than 30 years, and mothers with basic school education were the factors associated with CAM use. None reported a lack of trust in modern medicine as the reason behind resorting to CAM methods. It was noted that honey consumption was based on religious beliefs as the healing power of honey is highlighted in Islamic teachings. [21](#B21-children-10-00713)]. [78](#B78-children-10-00713)]. Taking these cultural and religious factors into consideration, prayer is one of the most used approaches by parents in CAM. In Saudi, 79 mothers were questioned regarding the reasons they resorted to CAM use in their children with chronic conditions, including epilepsy. A total of 42% of the families used CAM for their children, and 57% of those had not asked for medical help beforehand. In addition, 82% relied on religious healing, and oral preparations or herbs were used in 30 % of the patients [ [79](#B79-children-10-00713)]. [80](#B80-children-10-00713)]. Traditional healers are consulted for epilepsy treatment and are trusted. In a study that interviewed 180 parents of epilepsy patients, 58 (32.2%) interviewees believed epilepsy is due to supernatural causes. A large majority of them (70.5%) used CAM (e.g., incantations (45.6%), spitting cure (37.2%), and ritual incensing (36.7%)) to treat epilepsy [ [81](#B81-children-10-00713)]. [82](#B82-children-10-00713)]. More than 250 species from different families have been categorized in massive archives of plant species and are used by some to this day [ [77](#B77-children-10-00713), [83](#B83-children-10-00713), [84](#B84-children-10-00713)]. The study reviewed five of the most important Iranian herbal books between the 10th and 18th centuries, one of which was the Canon. The Canon, which means ''The Law'', was one of the most significant contributions made by the famous Persian physician Avicenna in the Western world (980-1037 AD). It is considered the biggest medical encyclopedia of its time L. were mentioned in all five books reviewed, demonstrating their significance through hundreds of years. \"Peganum harmala L.\" and \"Ruta graveolens L.\" are examples of known plants for the treatment of epilepsy in ancient Egypt [ [85](#B85-children-10-00713)]. \"Mariam's palm\", or Anastatica hierochuntica L. is used for the treatment of seizures by Bedouin people in the Sinai desert [ [86](#B86-children-10-00713)]. [87](#B87-children-10-00713)]. [88](#B88-children-10-00713)]. For example, newer Briveracetam, Rufinamide, and other hand, Lacosamide, Eslicarbazepine, and Perampanel are only available in the richer gulf countries of the region [ [12](#B12-children-10-00713)]. - 7. - Yoga [84](#B84-children-10-00713)]. Yoga helps reduce stress and cortisol levels and restores the balance between the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems [ [89](#B89-children-10-00713)]. This can be attributed to \"yoga breathing.\" Because emotional states can increase respiratory demand, yoga helps to reverse this by increasing parasympathetic activity. Stretching the alveolar receptors, baroreceptors, and chemoreceptors in the respiratory system transmits information to the nervous systems that regulate emotion, behavior, cognition, and perception. Reducing stress is a method to also diminish the allosteric load. The allosteric load is the impact that deviation from homeostasis has on the body and disease progression, and when stressed, the allosteric load increases [ [89](#B89-children-10-00713)]. The practice of yoga has been shown to diminish the allosteric load through reducing stress reactivity and regulating the GABA release, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. Lower than normal levels of GABA have been associated with epilepsy, and yoga practices increase the levels of GABA along with serotonin and dopamine, which are protective from other psychiatric disorders (Streeter). [90](#B90-children-10-00713)]. The subjects engaged in 2-3 home sessions over 6 months. The results showed that after a 6-week period with 2-3 sessions per week, there was a downward trend in anxiety and depression symptoms and no seizures were reported during the study. Another similar study was a randomized controlled trial involving 20 patients, showing that yoga is helpful in reducing seizures and improving EEG results after 6 months compared to the control group [ [91](#B91-children-10-00713)]. The limitations included a small sample size and the lack of a randomized controlled study. [23](#B23-children-10-00713)]. - 8. - Diets [92](#B92-children-10-00713)]. Apart from the ketogenic or Atkins diet and dietary considerations in children with metabolic syndromes, patients or families may turn to diet therapies that are self-imposed. The Mediterranean diet is high in plant-based foods and seafood and low in processed meats and sweets. A cross-sectional study looked at the nutritional status of the Mediterranean diet on 85 children with epilepsy. Adherence to the diet was measured with the Mediterranean Diet Quality Index (KIDMED). The results showed a positive statistical relationship between the KIDMED score and the levels of magnesium, carbohydrates, iron, potassium, calcium, and soluble fiber. The results showed that the average number of seizures per week in children with a moderate to high adherence to the diet was lower than the children with a low adherence; however, it was not statistically significant [ [93](#B93-children-10-00713)]. Children with a higher adherence to the diet may be more likely to also be adherent to ASDs, which may have contributed to the results. Additionally, the Mediterranean diet has numerous other positive health benefits and is potentially easier to adhere to than the ketogenic diet. Conversely, the diet is also high in sodium, which has been associated with hypertension and cardiovascular disease, and children were found to have a higher sodium intake when there was a stronger adherence to the diet. [94](#B94-children-10-00713)]. After five months of a gluten-free diet, six of seven patients had their seizure activity successfully controlled and anticonvulsant medication was stopped. The limitations include but are not limited to the sample size. [95](#B95-children-10-00713)]. It is an eating plan which removes foods believed to cause food intolerance. Studies have speculated that the inflammatory processes that elicit epileptic episodes are largely attributed to allergic reactions. In a prospective study of 34 patients aged 3 months to 16 years old with non-IgE-mediated and mixed food allergies based on skin and serum testing, an elimination diet was instituted over 12 weeks and the seizure frequency was measured following the intervention. There were six food eliminations, which included cow's milk, egg, peanut, soy, wheat, and sea foods. After 12 weeks, it was found that 17 patients did not have any seizures after 8 weeks and 12 patients had a significant decrease (51-99%) in the number of seizures. [96](#B96-children-10-00713)]. The Feingold diet eliminates natural salicylates and artificial colors and flavors. The child was given the Feingold diet and then removed from it three times. Each time the diet was added, there was a notable reduction in the seizure frequency. The seizures were eliminated after one year. However, due to the Feingold diet decreasing the intake of carbohydrates and potentially some essential vitamins, it is recommended that this diet only be implemented under medical supervision. This is a single case report and hence the efficacy of the Feingold diet may need further research. [97](#B97-children-10-00713)]. - 9. - Music Therapy [98](#B98-children-10-00713)]. A 2014 pediatric RCT study showed that listening to Mozart K.448 reduced epileptiform discharges and seizure recurrence in children who had one unprovoked seizure of unknown etiology [ [99](#B99-children-10-00713)]. A long-term (up to 6 months) beneficial effect of listening to Mozart K.448 was found [ [99](#B99-children-10-00713), [100](#B100-children-10-00713)]. Larger randomized control studies are needed to determine the effectiveness. Further research would elucidate whether these beneficial effects exist only while listening to specific types of music or may persist after listening to the music. - 10. - Aromatherapy and Olfactory Stimulation or Training [101](#B101-children-10-00713)]. Yilmaz et al. studied the effect of olfactory training with lavender aroma in 24 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy [ [102](#B102-children-10-00713)]. The results demonstrated a decrease in seizure frequency and duration and an increase in quality of life that were statistically significant. In Isler et al.'s study conducted in Turkey, parents reported using various aromas to stop their child's seizures, such as the smell of a lemon cologne, onions, and garlic [ [21](#B21-children-10-00713)]. In South East Asia, smelling shoes is a method to cease seizures [ [103](#B103-children-10-00713)]. 3.1.3. Perceived Effectiveness and Adverse Effects of CAM Therapies [15](#B15-children-10-00713)]. 3.1.4. Reasons for Using CAM [104](#B104-children-10-00713)]. In Beattie et al., 5% percent of the patients used CAM because they believed that prescribed medications were harmful, 14% because the prescribed medications were ineffective, 2% because CAM resonated with their beliefs, and 9% because CAM worked on others [ [19](#B19-children-10-00713)]. The majority reported that they were willing to try anything that would improve their child's epilepsy. [105](#B105-children-10-00713), [106](#B106-children-10-00713), [107](#B107-children-10-00713), [108](#B108-children-10-00713), [109](#B109-children-10-00713)]. In a German study, the majority of participants were compliant with conventional care while using CAM [ [23](#B23-children-10-00713)] but were significantly less satisfied with conventional care than non-CAM users. Reasons patients cited for using CAM included a reduction in seizure frequency, the treatment of ASM side effects, or management of other health problems. [110](#B110-children-10-00713)]. [111](#B111-children-10-00713)]. Most patients with epilepsy visited traditional healers of more than 3 years prior to starting medical therapy and initiating medications regardless of age, gender, or household education level. This was due to the widespread, inaccurate beliefs about the cause and transmissibility of epilepsy. Collaboration with traditional healers is essential for public health education regarding epilepsy. [Table 2](#children-10-00713-t002)summarizes the numerous reasons parents have for using CAM, predictors of CAM use, and whether the parents had discussed CAM usage with their child's physician. 3.1.5. Predictors of CAM Use [20](#B20-children-10-00713)]. This may also reflect that these patients may have less tractable epilepsy. Past use of CAM was reported to be a reliable predictor of current CAM use [ [29](#B29-children-10-00713)]. [18](#B18-children-10-00713)]. [10](#B10-children-10-00713)]. Education level and its association with CAM use appears to differ in different geographical locations based on the literature. It was postulated that the association between CAM use and speech delay was likely explained by the lack of accessible speech therapy services in the community. [19](#B19-children-10-00713)]. Not surprisingly, a large percentage (85%) of the respondents identified as Christian. 3.1.6. Patient-Physician Communication Regarding CAM Use [19](#B19-children-10-00713)]. Furthermore, a large percentage of patients stated that they had not discussed using CAM with their child's physician ( [Table 2](#children-10-00713-t002)). Liow et al. found that less than half of the participants indicated that their child's physician was aware of their CAM usage [ [112](#B112-children-10-00713)]. Caregivers or parents may not voluntarily offer such information unless asked. Some patients did not believe sharing such information was necessary. Other potential reasons for the lack of voluntary disclosure of CAM use were hypothesized to include a fear of judgement, stigma, or rejection. [Table 2](#children-10-00713-t002)). Furthermore, over 85% of all parents wished to discuss CAM usage with their child's neurologist but did not. Another survey of pediatric patients in a multiethnic community in Singapore concluded that caregivers used CAM for their child without thoroughly understanding the effects and drug interactions of CAM [ [27](#B27-children-10-00713)]. 4. Discussion [113](#B113-children-10-00713)]. While herbal medicines have the potential to cause severe side effects, only a few countries have laws requiring licensing for herbal remedies, such as Germany, France, Australia, and Sweden, to ensure the quality of herbal preparations. In the United States, products such as herbal medicines were removed from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s jurisdiction due to the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. As herbs are considered dietary supplements, manufacturers are not required to demonstrate safety and efficacy before producing, selling, and marketing herbs. However, herbal supplements are still regulated by the FDA despite FDA approval not being needed to sell these products. As part of FDA regulation, herbal medicine falls under the dietary supplement category and must be free of contaminants, be accurately labeled, and refrain from making medical claims. Products not being regulated by the FDA does not mean there are no manufacturing standards in place as pharmaceutical-grade herbal products are commercially available as well as independent labs that test products for purity and contamination. [114](#B114-children-10-00713)]. [115](#B115-children-10-00713)]. While some states require a medical prescription to buy CBD products, elsewhere CBD products are sold only at licensed dispensaries. As a result of the 2018 farm bill (Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, P.L. 115-334), CBD products derived from hemp are not subject to federal regulation and oversight. Therefore, hemp-derived CBD products are available for purchase over [117](#B117-children-10-00713), [118](#B118-children-10-00713), [119](#B119-children-10-00713)]. While pharmaceutical-grade cannabidiol (CBD) oil, also known as Epidiolex, has already been FDA approved for use, parents may purchase unregulated CBD oil, which may be unpurified, contaminated, or not contain CBD oil [ [120](#B120-children-10-00713)]. Furthermore, the inaccurate labeling of CBD products is a major concern for consumers. The FDA has tested CBD products on the market and issued several warning letters for the mislabeling of products [ [121](#B121-children-10-00713), [122](#B122-children-10-00713)]. This may lead to the inadvertent consumption of CBD products without consumers being aware or intoxication if dosing is not accurately labeled. Of note, THC intoxication has been shown to affect white matter development in the brain and impact cognitive functioning in adolescents [ [123](#B123-children-10-00713)]. [122](#B122-children-10-00713)]. It may be difficult for parents and patients to find healthcare providers knowledgeable about CBD products; however, healthcare providers can still play an instrumental role in guiding and supporting patients and their families in their pursuit. Certain companies provide third-party testing and a \"Certificate of analysis (CAO)\" for their CBD products, which provides information about the quantity of CBD and the purity of the product. Furthermore, regarding the use of CBD products, patients should be advised to start with a low dose and gradually increase to minimize side effects and overdosing. While parents often perceive CBD as a suitable and safe option for their child, side effects to be aware of include somnolence, decreased appetite, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, and headache [ [124](#B124-children-10-00713)]. The positive side effects reported include improved cognition, sleep, and mood in addition to improved seizure control [ [125](#B125-children-10-00713)]. To minimize adverse effects, purchasing from a reputable brand with third-party testing and a CAO, ensuring the storage of the CBD out of reach of children, and starting with a low dose while gradually increasing may be helpful [ [126](#B126-children-10-00713)]. [19](#B19-children-10-00713)]. Limitations [25](#B25-children-10-00713)]. The questions and options listed in surveys administered may additionally impact the results. Therefore, the comparability of the percentage of CAM users is limited and is a major limitation in comparing the prevalence of CAM use. 5.
