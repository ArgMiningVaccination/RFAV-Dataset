Exercises, stress reduction, weight loss, and detoxification are some of the lifestyle modifications that you can bring into your life. Read this blog to know ways to stimulate your pancreas to produce insulin hormones in your body. Pancreas And Its Functions Before jumping directly on how to increase insulin in body, let's understand what pancreas is. Picture a small, flat organ near your stomach - that's your pancreas! Even though it's small, its job is super important. The pancreas is a multitasking organ with two main types of functions: endocrine and exocrine. Let's dive deeper into the pancreas function insulin. 1. Endocrine Functions: The endocrine functions of the pancreas involve the production and secretion of hormones directly into the bloodstream. These hormones play a crucial role in regulating [blood sugar levels](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/blood-sugar-levels-how-glucose-levels-affect-your-body/) and various other bodily functions. Insulin The insulin hormone of pancreas stimulates through special cells called beta cells. Insulin is a key hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels. When you eat, your blood sugar rises. Insulin allows sugar to enter your body's cells, where it's used for energy. This helps lower your blood sugar back to normal. Glucagon Another hormone produced by the pancreas, specifically by alpha cells, is glucagon. When your blood sugar drops too low, glucagon steps in. It tells the liver to release stored sugar, which raises your blood sugar levels back to where they should be.

It helps maintain a steady balance of these hormones to keep your blood sugar stable. Pancreatic Polypeptide This hormone is produced by pancreatic polypeptide cells and helps regulate various digestive processes, appetite, and food intake. 2. Exocrine Functions The exocrine functions of the pancreas involve producing enzymes and other substances that aid in digestion. These substances are released into the digestive tract to help break down food so that the body can absorb nutrients. Enzymes The pancreas produces and releases enzymes such as amylase, lipase, and protease. Amylase breaks down carbohydrates into sugars, lipase breaks down fats into fatty acids, and protease breaks down proteins into amino acids. These enzymes are crucial for breaking down the different types of nutrients in your food, making them easier for your body to absorb. Bicarbonate The pancreas also secretes bicarbonate, a substance that neutralizes the acidic contents of your stomach as they enter the small intestine. This provides a more suitable environment for the enzymes to work effectively and protects the lining of the intestine from the acidity. Summary The pancreas has a dual role. Its endocrine functions involve producing hormones that regulate blood sugar and other bodily processes. Its exocrine functions involve producing enzymes and substances that aid in digestion, making it a vital player in maintaining overall health and ensuring the efficient functioning of the digestive and metabolic systems.
