Homeopathic medicine is based on the research and observation of the 18th century, German doctor, Samuel Hahnemann. He hypothesized, like Hippocrates, two thousand years earlier, that what a drug can cause, it can cure, which is the way of similar. Indeed the word 'homeopathy' is Greek for 'similar suffering'. Unhappy with the large doses of compound mixtures prescribed by conventional doctors in his time, which Hahnemann felt did more harm than good, he strove to reduce the toxic side-effects of his remedies, by serial dilution and succession, or shaking.
