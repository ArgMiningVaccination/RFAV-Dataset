The lucky ones who can enjoy this moment in the comfort of their own home may have already rolled out this seasonal activity in all its glory. Some others, instead, are waiting for the next weekend getaway to enjoy the hotel room bathtub. Whatever the case, pretty much everyone loves to indulge in a comforting, relaxing bath, whether it's daily, weekly, monthly, during New Moon or whenever you feel the need to. In today's Love Letter, we give you the lowdown to revamp your current bath rituals and take them up a notch by sprinkling a little luxury here and there. With the help of course, of the best holistic tools to make each bath a memorable one! TAKE A DEEP BREATH, RELAX AND IMMERSE IN THE BEST BATH OF YOUR LIFE Unlike Japan, Korea or Iceland, the Western culture does not equate baths as a part of our overall health. We are often brought to think of them as an unnecessary waste of time, which can be optimized with a quick shower. However, in other parts of the globe, baths have spoken for centuries to the natural healing properties of water. Beyond the more obvious relaxing and muscle-soothing benefits, baths are a unique chance for soulful transformations, as they can channel your creativity and activate powerful insights, establish and strengthen boundaries, or even heal from deep, psychic pain. And if you fancy tapping into the Moon's power, a New Moon bath is an overall cleansing experience to help you part with what is no longer serving you, while helping you set a new intention or start fresh with focus and clarity. The goal is to try and create an emotional connection with your bathroom. Take a deep breath, this is your moment to feel good.
