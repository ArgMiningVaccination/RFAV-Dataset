As the name implies, complementary therapies complement conventional treatments. Many of them such as therapeutic touch contain diagnostic and therapeutic methods that require special training. Others such as guided imagery and breathwork are easily learned and applied. Complementary therapies also include relaxation; exercise; massage; reflexology; prayer; biofeedback; hypnotherapy; creative therapy; meditation. Chiropractic therapy; and herbs/supplements (Lindquist etal., 2014). Another term that is used to describe interventions used in this fashion, particularly by licensed health care providers, isintegrative therapies. Alternative therapiessometimes include the same interventions as complementary therapies; but they become the primary treatment (Table 33-1). For example, a person with chronic pain uses yoga to encourage flexibility and relaxation while nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory or opioid medications are prescribed. Both sets of interventions are based on conventional pathophysiology and anatomy while acknowledging the mind-body connection that contributes to the physiological pain response. In this case yoga is used as a complementary intervention. In contrast, another patient decides that a meditative practice that includes yoga and other lifestyle changes is more helpful than an allopathic approach to chronic pain. This patient studies these practices more deeply, adhering to one of the many schools or traditions, and decides to use them as the primary approach to manage chronic pain. In this case yoga is an alternative treatment. Several therapies are always considered alternative because they are based on completely different philosophies and life systems than those used by allopathic medicine. These are identified by the NIH/NCCIH aswhole medical systemsand include practices such astraditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Ayurveda, and naturopathy (see Table 33-1).
