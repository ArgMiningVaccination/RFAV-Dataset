Why didn't anyone ever tell me?\" This is a conservation I recently had with my father. He was referring to my mother, but his addled brain often mixes things up. You see, my father has Alzheimer disease. Over the last few years he has gradually deteriorated to the point where his cognitive issues are now obvious to everyone. However, I suspect this dementing process has been going on for much longer than we know. My father is outgoing and constantly joking, so he can make it seem like he knows someone without ever ac - tually having to identify them. He still talks to everyone, and he'll tell me that he used to play golf with complete strangers he meets at the store. These confabulations fit seam-lessly into the day-to-day situations he is confronted with. (As an aside, I suspect that he has been making up his golf scores for years.) I'm not sure he is even aware of who I am at times. I still get glimpses of the man he used to be, and I am very thankful that his underlying personality hasn't changed. He remains happy, pleas-ant, appreciative, and easygoing. So far he hasn't demonstrated any sig-nificant irritability or agitation and is blissfully unconcerned about his de - clining mental functions. If you asked friends and family to describe my father in one word, I'm pretty sure it would be jokester. My father would never turn down an opportunity to goof around, make someone laugh, or dress up in some funny\u2014often inappropriate\u2014cos-tume. This is the man most likely to be found at the office in a gorilla suit, not necessarily on Halloween. I dis-tinctly remember him coming to my parent-teacher interviews and draw-ing funny faces on the chalkboard. In old party photos he is often dressed up as a woman holding a liquor bottle, but that's another story. My parents' house was often adorned with singing Christmas trees, fish, dogs, etc. If my father knew he was going to get de-mentia, he would have probably made jokes about it and encouraged me to make fun of him when he no longer made any sense. Now, don't get me wrong, this disease is terrible and causes much sadness. I am losing my father, my mother has lost her partner, and my children have lost their grandfather. When I remember the man he was, I suffer a little despair as to all that is missing. However, the humorous things he does make the progression of his dementia more tolerable, and I know he would encourage everyone to laugh along if he could. So, if I gig-gle a little, I feel less guilty because I remind myself that making people laugh has been his lifelong mission. Recently friends took him to vis- it my mother in hospital, which is a 30-minute drive from his house. Lat - er, I asked him how he got there, and after thinking for a while he stated, \"I think I walked.\" After a chuckle, I thought to my- self that living with his dementia re-ally is a journey, and as we walk together I will do my best to support him with grace, love, and laughter. \u2014DRReditorials \" info@pollockclinics.com 604-717-6200 www.pollockclinics.com Men's Sexual Health Program for your Patients with Erectile Dysfunction Shockwave Therapy - low intensity acoustic sound wave technology Platelet Rich Plasma Therapy (PRP Shot)Sex Therapy with a certified and experienced Sex Therapist No doctor referral is required.62 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 2, march 2019 bcmj.orgeditorials We buried a colleague re- cently. To be more precise, we said farewell to a now- deceased colleague. He was a true gentleman, an excellent surgeon, and notably, possessed an incredible ca-pacity to make his family, his friends, and his patients feel special. What was really astounding about him, though, was how he navigated all of the chal-lenges of his personal and professional life with such grace and balance. (He was the only surgeon in town when he first arrived, and is the only surgeon I've ever known to do house calls.) How did he do it? How did he cultivate a resiliency adequate to the demands of his life? And, as his former col-league who is struggling with similar demands, how can I do the same? Most of his (and my) colleagues who were at his memorial were either fully retired or had relinquished their hospital privileges years ago. None of them ever expressed regret over their decision to leave the hospital, and many of them told stories of the mo-ments that were the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. I almost had one of those mo- ments a few weekends ago after a particularly grueling overnight call shift and group ward rounds over the same weekend. Although these irri - tants don't happen often, when they do it is extremely upsetting. After be-ing at the hospital from early Saturday morning to early Sunday afternoon, I was about to pull into my garage when my pager went off. The call was from a nurse asking me to return to the hospital to provide a consent for transfusion on a patient who was about to be transfused for the 16th time over the previous year. I asked politely for her to check the patient's file, as he had received a transfusion as recently as 10 days prior. The nurse looked through his file, found the nec-essary document, and a return trip to the hospital was avoided. I planned an early night with the hope of getting a good recovery sleep. It was not to be. My home phone rang at 2:15 a.m. from a different nurse re-garding the same patient. I asked the nurse, in my most polite voice, why he was calling me at that hour as op-posed to calling the doctor on call for our group. He told me that it was be-cause he thought I was the doctor re-sponsible for the patient on any day at any hour. The nurse soon realized that I wasn't even this patient's fam-ily doctor, so he told me that he would call my colleague instead. Hastily, I corrected him and referred him to the call schedule for our group. He must have been new, as he was completely oblivious to the on-call system at our hospital. So, at 2:15 in the morning, instead of getting a good amount of sleep, I found myself in a highly ir - ritated state trying to politely school this nurse into figuring out which doc-tor was on call. The following day I came this close (my right thumb and index fin-ger are just millimetres apart) to giv-ing up my hospital privileges. After venting to colleagues and practising some mindfulness, I was able to calm down. But the events of that week-end along with personal factors in my life have made me re-evaluate my priorities. I had had an epiphany a few weeks prior. I had been using work to escape from some of the personal challenges I faced. I have stopped doing that and am now enjoying having the major - ity of my weekends completely free to exercise, cook, read, relax, and spend time with my loved ones. I'm starting to feel like a normal person, perhaps for the first time since I quali - fied as a doctor. I feel more resilient and happier in my work and personal life. When I remarked on this to my 18-year-old son, he informed me that he had known for years what I had just realized about myself. What a smart kid he is. Hopefully he won't take after his dad! \u2014DBC Lessons, priorities, mindfulness, challenges, and epiphanies I had been using work to escape from some of the personal challenges I faced.

Yet just as we wouldn't improve as cooks, planners, and par - ents without the occasional defeat along the way, we cannot have prog-ress in health care without failure. History has shown that success rarely comes quickly or easily\u2014and certainly not without failure. The next time you fix your squeaky door you can thank the engineers who failed 39 times before finding the water-dis-placing formula that is still used more than 65 years later in WD-40. 1 And while you may not remember Apple's desktop computer, Lisa, Steve Jobs learned from that mistake and focused his vision on creating the Macintosh, which paved the way for the iPhones and iPads so central in our lives to-day. And millions of us have seen the SpaceX landing, but how could we possibly dock a rocket on a raft with-out a number of unexpected ocean splashes? In health care, a teenager's fail- ure to create a synthetic form of an antimalarial drug led to the creation of purple dye, which in turn allowed As we scroll through Facebook photos and Instagram stories, it's easy to think that every- one else is winning at life with their perfect meals, epic beach vacations, and overachieving children. While sometimes opportunity does meet preparation, reality is usually full of burned dinners, rainouts, and excru-ciating tantrums. In health care, we have our own culture of perfection where success is rightly celebrated, but we are slow to move away from the traditionally judgmental nature of morbidity and mortality rounds or the stoked com-petition of quantifying our learners through hallway pop quizzes. We've all experienced the disappointments Let's be real, we need more failure Dr Paul Ehr - lich to found the field of immunology. 2 And thanks to Wilson Great - batch's use of the wrong tran-sistor while trying to record a heartbeat, the implantable cardiac defibrillator was discovered. 3 However, conditions necessary for the productive process of failure are rarely in place. So how can we change this? Move past blame \" Remember that failure is an event, not a person.\" \u2014Zig Ziglar Despite the politicized times we live in, we must move past blaming others and recognize that health care is ex-tremely complex, and failure is in-evitable. We experience this in our clinical lives: some couples require more IVF treatments than others; some cancers respond to a certain chemotherapy while others don't; and some patients develop postsur - gery complications while others who have undergone the same procedure, in the same hospital, with the same team, don't. Depersonalizing failure will allow us to fairly assess outcomes and reassure others that they won't be judged solely by their outcomes, but rather by their efforts, intentions, it-erations, and inclusivity. Encourage and support failure \" I have not failed. I've just found 10 000 ways that won't work.\" \u2014Thomas Edison Like any process, failure requires re- sources.

Sure, there is a financial cost to failing\u2014at least in the short term\u2014but without a proper, protected budget, governments and health authorities have no incentives to be ambitious, and instead continue down the safer path, making small changes or blaming foundational issues on those who came before.

Our biggest mistake is not in failing, but in failing to learn from our fail-ures. 4 The health care landscape is full of ambitious ideas and projects such as one person/one record EMRs, alternative payment models, pooled referrals, primary care networks, and urgent primary care centres. They will not\u2014cannot\u2014all succeed every-where at once. And these bumps in the road will inform the rest of the journey, giving us the opportunity to improve all aspects of these projects, from change management, to fund-ing, to local needs, to leadership, even the assessment process itself. So let's move beyond the curated personas we see online and get real about helping our patients and build-ing a better health care system, be-cause only by recognizing the value of failure and supporting innovation can we ever truly succeed. \u2014Eric Cadesky, MDCM, CCFP, FCFP Doctors of BC President References 1.

I knew that my Doctors of BC membership is free during my 4 years of medical school, but I had forgotten that this includes a free CMA mem-bership, which means free access to handy resources such as RxTx and DynaMed Plus, not to mention vari - ous additional deals and discounts. I knew that I received free life in- surance with Doctors of BC through my 4 years of medical school as well, but as of the 2018-19 school year Doctors of BC disability insurance is also free through all 4 years. That's saving me at least $925 in premiums! I knew about the rural-rotation travel stipend of up to $800, but I al-most forgot about the $250 weekly housing allowance for up to 8 weeks: all the more reason to do a rural elec - tive in fourth year. I knew that Doctors of BC pro- vides some of the needs-based bursa-ries applied through the UBC Student Service Centre (up to $250 000 is do-nated each year), but I was not aware of other ways to win money. I could win a $1000 prize for submitting an article to the BCMJ, a $250 prize for writing a BCMJ blog post, a $5000 award for demonstrating interest in rural medicine, and a $1000 Change-maker Award for demonstrating lead - ership in advocacy. Of course, Doctors of BC hosts the much-anticipated annual Back-pack Day for first-year students, but this year I attended the other big (and arguably more important) annual event\u2014Find Your Match, where I and other students got insider tips from physicians from various disciplines while enjoying a scrumptious, fully catered meal.

This change affects the fol-lowing four GPSC incentives: G14033: GP Complex Care Planning and Manage-ment Fee G14043: GP Mental Health Planning Fee G14063: GP Palliative Care Planning Fee G14075: GP Frailty Complex Care Planning and Management Fee Simplifying billing The Personal Health Risk Assessment (Prevention) (G14066) has been amended to align with the GPSC planning fees. Physicians are no longer required to bill a visit fee in addition to the G14066 fee. A visit fee may still be billed in addition if medically required and does not take place concurrently with the face-to-face plan-ning included under G14066. This change is effective 1 January 2019.Clarifying documentation To reflect a recent change to MSP's counseling fee 0120, the GPSC added the following note to some of its mental health fees: \"Documentation of the effect(s) of the condition on the patient and what advice or service was provided is required.\" This note has been added to the following five GPSC fees: G14044: GP Mental Health Management Fee age 2-49 G14045: GP Mental Health Management Fee age 50-59 G14046: GP Mental Health Management Fee age 60-69 G14047: GP Mental Health Management Fee age 70-79 G14048: GP Mental Health Management Fee age 80+ It is recommended that GPs ensure that clinical notes for any 0120 or GPSC mental health management fee billing include the required documentation as of 1 December 2018.

ABSTRACT: Biotin, also known as vitamin B7 or vitamin H, has seen a surge in popularity in recent years based on limited evidence that it en-hances hair, skin, and nail growth. Due to its water-soluble properties, biotin is excreted through the uri - nary system and is considered non-toxic even at large doses. However, a high concentration of biotin in blood can interfere with laboratory tests that use technology dependent on biotin-streptavidin interactions. These tests include immunoassays used to investigate or monitor car - diac disease, endocrine disorders, malignancies, anemias, and infec - tious diseases. Increasingly, cases of erroneous laboratory results due to biotin use have been reported in the medical literature. The results can be falsely low or falsely high, and in either case can lead to pa-tient misdiagnosis and misman-agement. Mitigation is possible when biotin interference is iden - tified. Patients can be advised to discontinue the supplement before follow-up testing or physicians can order an alternative testing meth - od. While laboratory professionals have been aware of biotin interfer - ence for many years, greater aware-ness among health care providers in general is needed to ensure that biotin supplementation is identi-fied and mitigation strategies are considered. A 54-year-old female was be- ing assessed for thyroid dysfunction following self- reported symptoms of weight gain and lethargy. The patient had no neck tenderness and exhibited no symp-toms of goiter. Past medical history was significant for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and anxiety. Labo-ratory investigations were ordered and the results were consistent with thyroid-stimulating pmol/L).

When a similar pattern of values was found (TSH 0.01 mU/L, FT4 > 103.0 pmol/L, a referral was made to en-docrinology. Upon being questioned by the endocrinologist, the patient described taking high-dose biotin for her multiple sclerosis. The patient was advised to stop the biotin for 1 week before repeat testing. Follow-up blood work revealed the patient to be euthy-roid, with a TSH level of 1.78 mU/L, FT4 of 12.6 pmol/L, and FT3 of 3.7 pmol/L, along with an undetectable TSH receptor antibody titre. Clinical and commercial use of biotin Biotin, also known as vitamin B7 or vitamin H, is a water-soluble vitamin that serves as a cofactor for a number of carboxylase reactions, making it essential to the functioning of various metabolic pathways. 1-4 It is involved in fatty acid synthesis, of branched-chain amino acids, gluco-neogenesis, islet cell gene expres-sion, insulin secretion, and the Krebs cycle. 4 The recommended dietary ref- erence intake for biotin is 30 g/day. The vitamin is found in various foods, including egg yolk, pork, liver, whole cereals, soybeans, avocado, cauli-flower, and leafy greens. 1-4 Because of its abundance in a typical North American diet, biotin deficiency is uncommon, and supplementation is rarely indicated. Clinically, biotin may be prescribed in patients with malabsorptive disorders or in those on total parenteral nutrition. It may also be useful in relieving muscle cramps in hemodialysis patients. 5 High doses of biotin (5 to 30 mg/day) are recom-mended in certain inborn errors of metabolism, such as in biotinidase deficiency, propionic acidemia, or in holocarboxylase synthetase dis-orders. recently, mega-doses of biotin (up to 300 mg/day) have shown promise in secondary progres-sive multiple sclerosis. 7 In the past decade, biotin supple- mentation in doses up to 20 mg a day has been marketed to promote hair, skin, and nail growth. Although there is limited evidence to support this claim, marketing led to biotin sales of up to 49.6 million units in the US alone between July 2016 and July 2017. 1 Biotin is currently the top- selling multivitamin supplement on Amazon.ca. Locally, a survey of 660 patients visiting the Diamond Health Care Centre Outpatient Laboratory at Vancouver General Hospital found that 50 respondents (7.6%) were tak-ing biotin. The majority of users were female (92%) and biotin users tended to be younger than non-users: age 49 (19 to 85) years versus age 54 (19 to 98) years. The prevalence of biotin supplementation in our survey popu-lation was similar to that reported by the Mayo Clinic, which found 7.7% of outpatients to be ingesting biotin. 1Biotin interference with laboratory tests As biotin is readily available over the counter and is perceived to be harm-less, patients may not disclose their biotin use to physicians unless spe-cifically asked. Further, health care providers may also view biotin sup-plementation as innocuous. However, when found in high concentrations in blood, biotin can interfere with laboratory tests that employ biotin-streptavidin interactions as part of the assay technology. Biotin-streptavidin binding is commonly used in immuno-assays due to its avidity and stability, which facilitate immunoassay sensi-tivity and specificity. A 2017 study by Holmes and colleagues found that out of the 374 methods operated by 8 of the most popular immunoassay analyzers in the US, 221 (59%) were biotin-based. 4 Depending on the lab- oratory and the analytical platforms used, a broad range of tests may be affected by biotin supplementation, including those used in the diagnosis Increasingly, biotin consumption is being found to result in inaccurate laboratory findings that lead to misdiagnosis and mismanagement.68 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 2, march 2019 bcmj.orgWhen vitamin supplementation leads to harm: The growing popularity of biotin and its impact on laboratory testing or monitoring of cardiac disease, endocrine disorders, malignancies, anemias, and infectious diseases ( Table 1 ).6 Biotin-containing blood samples can affect laboratory tests by com - peting with biotinylated reagents for binding to streptavidin. Depending on whether the assay is noncompeti-tive or competitive, the result may be falsely low or falsely high ( Figure ). In noncompetitive or sandwich immu - noassays, supplemental biotin com - petes with reagent biotin for binding to streptavidin-coated beads. With a smaller volume of reagent biotin-streptavidin complexes formed, the assay signal is decreased and a facti-tiously low result is reported. This is in contrast to competitive immunoas-says, which are generally used to mea-sure small molecules such as FT4 or FT3, where the assay signal is inverse-ly proportional to the analyte concen-tration. In these immunoassays, biotin competes with labelled biotinylated analyte for binding to streptavidin and results can be spuriously high. In the Holmes study referred to above, 37% of the biotin-based im - munoassays evaluated were affected by serum biotin levels of less than 51 ng/mL. 4 Mean peak serum biotin concentrations of 8.6 ng/mL have been reported following consumption of a single dose of 1 mg, while con-centrations of 495 ng/mL have been reported following consumption of 100 mg. 4 In a study by Grimsey and colleagues, ingestion of biotin for 5 consecutive days was found to pro-duce peak median serum biotin lev-els of 46 ng/mL (5 mg dose daily), 103 ng/mL (10 mg dose daily), and 184 ng/mL (20 mg dose daily). 8 The higher the dose of biotin ingested, the more likely that biotin-based labora-tory assays will be impacted. Increasingly, biotin consumption is being found to result in inaccurate laboratory findings that lead to mis-diagnosis and mismanagement. Mis-leading thyroid function results are often described in the medical litera-ture, 2,3,9-13 as biotin causes falsely high FT4 and FT3 values and falsely low TSH results that mimic hyperthyroid-ism. In one reported case, a newborn female with a positive screening test for congenital hypothyroidism was found to have decreasing TSH levels and elevated FT4 levels on subsequent testing. 12 Further investigations re - vealed that the neonate had been start-ed on a vitamin cocktail containing 10 mg of biotin daily because the baby's sibling had died of organic acidosis a few years prior. Discontinuation of biotin supplementation and repeat thyroid function testing using an alter - native methodology confirmed the ini-tial diagnosis of hypothyroidism, and thyroxine therapy was initiated. In another case, a 64-year-old fe - male with end-stage renal disease was thought to have adynamic bone dis-ease due to a low normal parathyroid hormone (PTH) level, intermittently Conditions Immunoassays Cardiac disease Troponin I, troponin Gastrin, alpha fetoprotein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (CA) 19-9, CA 125, CA 15-3 Calcitonin Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) Anemias Ferritin Folate, vitamin B12 Infectious diseases Hepatitis A virus (HAV) serologies: HAV total, anti-HAV total, anti-HAV IgM Samarasinghe S, Emanuele A, Meah F .4Table 1.

It was later discovered that the patient had been ingesting 10 mg of biotin per day for restless leg syn-drome. Repeat testing on a different analytical perform that did not use biotin-streptavidin technology found the patient's PTH concentration to be markedly elevated, consistent with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Mitigating biotin interference While laboratory professionals have been aware of biotin interference for many years, the problem has been amplified recently with increasing use of the supplement. In November 2017 a growing number of adverse events associated with biotin, including one patient death following an incorrect cardiac troponin assessment second-ary to biotin interference, led the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to warn the public, health care pro-viders, and laboratory personnel that biotin may interfere with certain lab-oratory tests and cause misleading test results. 15 It is paramount that health care providers and patients be informed of the potential errors in laboratory results with biotin use. Physicians should always ask their patients about biotin supplementation during history taking. The question should be thoughtfully posed (e.g., \"Are you taking any supplement for hair, skin, or nail benefits?\") since patients may not be aware of the ingredients in a supplement, as these are not always listed clearly on the label. Patients taking biotin should be advised to discontinue the vitamin for at least 1 day before a blood test, or up to a week before testing if high doses have been consumed. The half-life of biotin is dependent on various factors, including the patient's kidney function and the dose and duration of biotin use. In individuals with normal renal parameters, the half-life of bio-tin after a single dose of 0.6 mg has been reported as less than 2 hours. In contrast, the half-life following a sin-gle biotin dose of 100 mg to 300 mg is between 8 and 19 hours. 4,16 When patients on biotin require urgent blood work, such as when they present to the emergency department, the ordering physician should consult Competitive immunoassay Figure.

Laboratory physicians can provide information on which particular assays on the test menu may be affected by biotin, the magnitude and direction of interfer - ence, and whether some laboratory tests on the same analytical platform are more vulnerable to biotin in-terference than others. Further, the laboratory physician can arrange for alternative testing using a different methodology not affected by biotin or may be able to request removal of bi-otin from the sample via pretreatment with streptavidin-coated beads. 6,17 Fortunately, the results of a re - cent survey completed by 18 endo-crinologists in BC indicate a good understanding of biotin interference ( Table 2 ). However, endocrinology is not the only specialty affected, and further work is needed to ensure in-formation about the impact of biotin on laboratory testing is disseminated to all physicians. Summary The case of a 54-year-old female be-ing assessed for thyroid dysfunction demonstrates the harm vitamin sup - plementation can cause. In this case, laboratory findings erroneously indi - cated thyrotoxicosis\u2014findings that were eventually determined to be the result of high-dose biotin supple-mentation when the patient received follow-up testing, and she was ultim - ately diagnosed as euthryoid. When found in high concentra- tions in blood, biotin can interfere with laboratory tests that employ biotin-streptavidin interactions as part of the assay technology. Depend-ing on whether the assay is noncom-petitive or competitive, the result may be falsely low or falsely high. Increas-ingly, biotin consumption is being found to result in inaccurate labora-tory findings that can lead to misdiag-nosis and mismanagement. While responses from a recent survey completed by endocrinologists in BC indicate a good level of under - standing where biotin interference is concerned, more must be done to en-sure that physicians working within and outside the laboratory become fa-miliar with the potential of biotin to interfere with test results .

Interference thresholds differ widely among assays. Also, high biotin doses take more time to clear than low doses, and clearance takes longer in patients with impaired renal function. As a general rule: If a patient has been taking 10 mg of biotin per day, we recommend laboratory testing 24 hours following discontinuation of biotin for tests listed in Table 1. If a patient has been taking 300 mg of biotin per day, we recommend laboratory testing 7 days following discontinuation of biotin for tests listed in Table 1. 5. If the patient takes a high dose of biotin prior to the blood sample collection, will the laboratory be able to detect interference before issuing a report?a. Yes 0 0% b. No 16 94% c. Not sure 1 6% Answer: b. No The laboratory will not be able to detect the interference. We recommend health care providers always ask about biotin supplementation . If the patient is taking biotin, be sure to communicate this information to the laboratory. If you encounter a laboratory result that is inconsistent with the patient's clinical presentation, contact the laboratory to perform additional investigations or arrange for alternate testing, as needed.Table 2.

ABSTRACT: Since hepatitis C was discovered in 1989, the pharmaco-logical management of infections caused by the virus has undergone revolutionary changes, significant-ly improving cure rates and reduc-ing patient morbidity and mortality. Early treatment options included in-terferon and ribavirin, which were associated with significant side ef-fects and poor efficacy. In 2011 the first direct-acting antiviral agents were introduced and since have con-tinued to improve both the efficacy and tolerability of treatment. The development of the direct-acting antiviral agents has reduced disease burden, expanded treatment options for patients with different hepatitis C genotypes or other pre-existing comorbidities, and significantly im-proved cure rates, which now exceed 95% with newer antiviral agents. Barriers to using this therapy in British Columbia include subopti-mal population screening and diag-nosis, variable patient and physician knowledge, high drug costs, lack of insurance coverage for some antivi-rals, and difficulty accessing cover - age under Pharmacare. Re infection is also an ever-present risk. Using the antiviral therapies currently available and ensuring patients have better access to care would make eliminating hepatitis C pos-sible in British Columbia, especial-ly if health care providers, patient communities, and government agen-cies all strive to achieve this goal.Worldwide, hepatitis C is a major public health con-cern, with an estimated 71 million people being chronically infected with the virus (www.who .int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-c). Individuals with untreat-ed hepatitis C infection have an approximate fivefold increase in all-cause mortality and a twentyfold increase in liver-related mortality. 1 Acute hepatitis C infections can pres-ent asymptomatically, and approxi-mately 85% of acute infections will develop into chronic disease. 2 Chron- ic hepatitis C infections can cause significant liver damage, including the development of cirrhosis and he-patocellular carcinoma. 3,4 In addition Ms Dahiya is a student in the MD Under - graduate Program at the University of Brit- ish Columbia.

This article has been peer reviewed.73 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 2, march 2019 bcmj.orgThe revolutionary changes in hepatitis C treatment: A concise review to the hepatic manifestations, acute and chronic hepatitis C can have extra-hepatic manifestations, includ-ing disease processes associated with the virus and more specific immune-related end-organ effects. 5 Disease pro cesses associated with hepatitis C infection include renal insufficiency, type 2 diabetes, and insulin resis-tance, while more specific hepatitis C immune-related manifestations in-clude sicca syndrome, arthralgia, and extra-hepatic mani-festations contribute to the huge bur-den of disease that negatively impacts patient well-being and quality of life. In British Columbia, more new- ly reported hepatitis C cases are re-ported than elsewhere in Canada, 1 with the Metro Vancouver area hav-ing an alarmingly high incidence rate of 37.3 per 100 person-years among young injection drug users. 6 In a re- cent study of more than 1.1 million individuals in BC tested for hepati - tis C, a prevalence rate of 5.8% was reported. 1 While high incidence rates are associated with sex-trade work, incarceration, and injection drug use, high prevalence rates in British Co-lumbia are associated with the fol-lowing: male gender, a birthdate from 1945 to 1964, HIV or hepatitis B co-infection, a mental health condition, a substance and/or alcohol abuse dis-order, and low socioeconomic status. 1 Despite advances in management and better understanding of viral gen-otypes, 7 hepatitis C infection contin- ues to pose a threat to public health in Canada and other countries. 2 Screening A high proportion of Canadians with chronic hepatitis C infection remain undiagnosed, 8 making it important for physicians and other health care providers to understand screening recommendations that will help with diagnosis and, ultimately, eradica-tion of hepatitis C. The Canadian As-sociation for the Study of the Liver released updated guidelines in 2018 that include recommendations on the assessment, evaluation, and manage-ment of hepatitis C. 8 The 2018 guide- lines recommend taking a risk-based and population-based approach to screening. 8 Chronic hepatitis C infec- tion is prevalent in individuals born from 1945 to 1975. 8 Despite the high prevalence of hepatitis C infection in this birth cohort, screening rates are low 8 and the guidelines recommend one-time screening in all individuals in the 1945 to 1975 birth cohort, in-dependent of individual risk factors. 8 For those with risk factors, testing for hepatitis C infection is recommended. Some notable risk factors for hep- atitis C are: A history of injection drug use. Having received a blood transfu-sion, blood products, or an organ transplant in Canada before 1992. A history of or current incarceration. Having received chronic hemo-dialysis. HIV infection. Initial screening includes a test for hepatitis C antibodies. 8 If test results are positive, active infection should be confirmed with an RNA screen for hepatitis C. 8 Subsequently, patients should be referred to practitioners with experience in hepatitis C man - agement to optimize treatment and outcomes. 8 The 2018 guidelines also recom- mend that patients with confirmed hepatitis C infections undergo further testing to help establish a baseline and individualize treatment. 8 Sug- gested testing includes routine blood work with a complete blood count, liver enzymes (alanine is recommended to exclude other infections (HIV , hepa-titis B) and common liver diseases (transferrin saturation for hemochro-matosis evaluation, IgG for autoim-mune hepatitis). 8 Furthermore, all patients with hepatitis C should un-dergo staging of their liver disease, including a baseline ultrasound and evaluation for fibrosis. 8 Other recommendations include resistance testing, if indicated, and genotype testing. 8 Six hepatitis C gen- otypes have been identified based on nucleotide differences. In turn, these numbered genotypes have been fur - ther classified by letter (1a, 2b, 3c, etc.). 7 Geographic differences are seen in the prevalence of some variants, with genotypes 1, 2, and 3 being com-mon throughout the world, genotype 4 being common in the Middle East, and genotype 1 being overwhelmingly dominant in North America. Knowing a patient's genotype can help select the most effective treatment. Early treatment options The first pharmacological regimen for hepatitis C was introduced in the 1990s and consisted of non-pegylated interferon alpha-2a or alpha-2b mono-therapy. 9 The treatment duration was 24 or 48 weeks, depending on the hepa-titis C genotype, and required thrice weekly injections. 9 As well as being cumbersome to patients and having significant side effects, the treatment was not very successful in achieving viral clearance as measured by the sustained virological response\u2014un-detectable hepatitis C RNA levels at 12 weeks or 24 weeks following the end of therapy. To increase the rates of sustained virological response, ribavirin was added to the interferon alpha treatment regimen, which im-proved outcomes and increased the response rates to approximately 30% to 40%. 9 However, treatment 74 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 2, march 2019 bcmj.orgresponse was heavily dependent on the hepatitis C genotype, with rela-tively poor cure rates reported in cases of genotype 1 and 4. 9 In the latter half of the 1990s, pegylated interferon alpha formu- lations were introduced. Pegylation slows down the rate of drug absorp-tion, reduces distribution, and de - creases the rate of elimination. 10 With pegylation, ideal plasma concentra - tions for inhibiting viral replication are better maintained, improving drug efficacy and increasing rates of sustained virological response. 10 However, response rates for pegylat-ed interferon were found to be heavily dependent on patient-specific charac-teristics: body mass index, degree of pretreatment hepatic damage (specif-ically, cirrhosis), IL-28B genotype, and hepatitis C RNA viral load. In cases of patients with treatment expe-rience, the response to previous treat-ment (i.e., relapse vs nonresponse) was also a factor. 11,12 Although pa - tients treated with pegylated interfer - on plus ribavirin required only one rather than multiple injections per week, the therapy had a number of side effects. 10 Adverse effects associ- ated with hypothyroidism, hyperthy-roidism, flu-like symptoms, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. 13 Interfer - on therapy was also associated with neuropsychiatric side effects, namely impaired memory and concentration, depression, and irritability. 13 Addi- tional side effects associated with ribavirin specifically included ane-mia, respiratory complications, and teratogenicity. 13 Due to the many po-tential systemic toxicities and com-plications, interferon therapy was contraindicated in many patients. For genotype 1, the most common genotype in Canada, the likelihood of achieving a sustained virological response was a disappointing 40%, at best, in noncirrhotic patients af-ter 48 weeks of therapy. 14 For the combined genotype 2 and 3 patients, 24 weeks of pegylated interferon and ribavirin yielded a sustained virologi-cal response of 76%. 15 Cirrhotic pa - tients in general responded less well to any interferon-based therapy, and those with advanced cirrhosis requir - ing a liver transplant tolerated the therapy poorly and experienced sig-nificant adverse side effects, includ-ing worsening decompensation and death. 16 In short, interferon-based therapies were associated with sig-nificant side effects and suboptimal treatment success rates, and the use of interferon was contraindicated in patients with advanced liver disease. Current treatment options In 2011 the first direct-acting antiviral agents were developed and approved for the treatment of hepatitis C infec-tion. 17 These novel antiviral medica - tions include the following classes of drugs: NS3/4A protease inhibitors, NS5A replication complex inhibitors, and NS5B polymerase inhibitors. As shown in the Figure ,18 direct-acting antiviral agents were developed to target the products of the nonstruc - tural coding sequence of hepatitis C, thus directly impairing the replicative machinery of the virus rather than relying on the nonspecific antiviral ef-fects of pegylated interferon and riba-virin. 7 The Table shows a list of the currently available products and their pivotal registration clinical trials. 19-53 Each product uses a combination of drugs to achieve an additive or syner - gistic effect.

Barriers to overcome Treatment of hepatitis C has under - gone revolutionary changes since the early 1990s. The introduction of direct-acting antivirals in particular has improved cure rates and reduced patient all-cause and liver-specific mortality and morbidity. Treatment has gone from being cumbersome and ineffective to being well tolerated and highly effective. But although good treatment options exist, the complete eradication of the disease in British Columbia will require over - coming some barriers. These include suboptimal population screening and diagnosis, variable patient and phys-ician knowledge, high drug costs, lack of insurance coverage for some antivirals, and difficulty accessing coverage under Pharmacare. In addi-tion, direct-acting antivirals do not work for a small but real minority, and reinfection is an ever-present risk. 54 The World Health Organization has declared that eliminating hepatitis C globally by 2030 is feasible. 55 Using the antiviral therapies currently avail - able and ensuring patients have better access to care would make eliminat-ing hepatitis C a realistic goal in Brit-ish Columbia, especially if health care providers, patient communities, Brand nameManufacturer Geno-typeDrugs and doses use in patients with chronic kidney disease (including dialysis patients) 39 Vosevi Gilead Sciences41 1-68400 mg sofosbuvir, 100 For use in patients with chronic kidney disease (including dialysis patients) 53Table.

The revolutionary changes in hepatitis C treatment: A concise review78 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 2, march 2019 bcmj.orgCare cascades Care cascades are visual tools used to track patients' journeys across illness and care stages such as screened or diagnosed, referred to care, treatment assessment, treatment, and status of treatment goal (e.g., viral suppression or cure). They can be constructed at various levels, from groups of pa - tients at one or more clinics to entire geographic areas such as a health au-thority or province. Care cascades 1 are usually presented as bar graphs, showing stages of care for a particu-lar disease, and the number or por - tion of people progressing through each stage, thereby helping to rapidly identify stages where patients fall out of care and where barriers to care pro-gression may be occurring; determine program effectiveness; and monitor progress toward achieving desired health outcomes. Using integrated health data Tracking patients across disease and care stages at the population level requires integrating data from mul - tiple sources, such as surveillance and diagnostic laboratory data, health care utilization and prescription medi-cation dispensing data, disease regis-tries, and vital statistics records. Data linked at the patient level are used to produce population-level estimates of care and treatment progress, which are visualized as a care cascade. Be-cause health and administrative data already exist, integrating them to es-timate these measures is an efficient method to assess care cascades, and bc centre for disease control Using population-level integrated health data to monitor and assess patients' progression across care and treatment continuums eliminates many biases associated with other types of data sources (e.g., clinical or cohort studies). Care cascades for hepatitis C While hepatitis C virus infection is associated with various liver and nonliver complications and high mor - bidity and mortality, the advent of highly effective direct-acting anti - viral medications has revolution-ized its management, prompting the World Health Organization to issue global hepatitis elimination goals. 2 To monitor progress toward achieving these goals, systems tracking patient progress across hepatitis C virus ill-ness and care stages are needed. To this end, in British Columbia, lab-oratory testing, prescription dispen-sation, mortality, and other health care administrative data have been integrated to create the BC Hepatitis Testers Cohort (BC-HTC), which contains health information on over 2 million BC residents. BC-HTC has helped identify gaps along the hepatitis C virus care con -tinuum,3 such as many patients not re- ceiving confirmatory hepatitis C virus RNA testing after a positive hepatitis C virus antibody test. These findings supported improved care-provider training, resources for care provid-ers and patients, and a reflexive hepa-titis C virus RNA testing pilot study at the BCCDC Public Health Labo-ratory. Having multiple data sources in the BC-HTC permits hepatitis C virus care cascades to be stratified by age, gender, geographic location, disease stage, comorbidities, and co-infections. Stratification of hepa - titis C virus care cascades based on these characteristics identified gaps in urban, rural, and remote services delivery, and highlighted how well population-specific needs are being met. In BC, the stage of care with the largest improvement in recent years has been driven by the availability of direct-acting antiviral medications, shown to improve all-cause mortality and reduce the risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer. However, the cascade of care in BC demonstrates contin-ued gaps in treatment uptake among people with a history of injection drug use. 4 Curing hepatitis C virus among people who inject drugs can prevent transmission to others, but to improve real-world health outcomes and meet hepatitis C virus elimination goals, more comprehensive harm reduction, addiction, and mental health supports are required.

Continued on page 8079 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 2, march 2019 bcmj.orgAccess to safe drinking water in First Nations communities and beyond The First Nations health Authority reports on the successes, the struggles, and the work still required to ensure all Canadians have potable water in their homes. Helena Swinkels, MD, MHSc, FCFP, FRCPC, Sylvia Struck, PhD, Linda Pillsworth, Btech, CPHI(C) As public health professionals at the First Nations Health Authority (FNHA), which serves First Nations communities in BC, we read with great interest Dr Charuka Maheswaran's article, \"Wa-ter, water everywhere but not a drop to drink!\" in the May 2018 issue of the BCMJ. 1 We would like to thank Dr Maheswaran and the Environmen-tal Health Committee of the Doctors of BC's Council on Health Promotion for their interest in this very important topic. We agree that it should indeed be possible for all Canadians to have potable water in their homes, and are working on this in partnership with First Nations communities in BC and the Department of Indigenous Servic-es Canada (ISC). There are common issues across remote, rural, and very small systems in Canada, including lack of access to and ability to retain trained operators, issues of scale, and treatment accep-tance (chlorination), among others. In general, however, and unlike in some areas of Canada, in First Na-tions communities in BC all homes that are occupied year round have access to piped water, and there is a low frequency of significant wa- ter quality issues such as E. coli and chemical exceedances in community and public water systems. Out of the 334 community and public water sys-tems that the FNHA reports on, 4% of drinking water systems are currently under drinking water advisories (as of 31 October 2018). 2 The number of advisories can fluctuate mainly due to short-term advisories. While the majority of First Na- tions community water systems meet Canadian guidelines for safe drink-ing water, additional progress can and must be made to improve sup-port for systems under advisory and for smaller systems (those with fewer than five connections), which current-ly do not receive infrastructure fund-ing through the federal government. The following key activities are sup-porting progress toward sustainable access to safe drinking water: First Nations communities work with the FNHA to assess if water meets or exceeds federal and pro-vincial guidelines for drinking wa-ter quality, and support access to safe drinking water. The FNHA and First Nations com-munities work together to increase the capacity and ownership of wa-ter systems in communities. The FNHA trains and funds members of First Nations communities as community-based water monitors to sample and test drinking water using in-community and accredited labs, and fully supports and funds this testing. ISC provides funding for commu-nity water systems infrastructure and operation and has commit-ted additional funding to support the resolution of drinking water special feature Continued on page 79Dr Swinkels is the senior medical officer public health for the First Nations Health Authority.

The FNHA's drinking water safety program manager and environmental health officers work with ISC to resolve drinking water issues and provide sustainable ac-cess to safe drinking water in First Nations communities. ISC provides training for First Na-tions water systems operators, and supports the Circuit Rider Program, which provides training and men-torship by highly experienced and certified operators and works with operators in First Nation communi - ties to support operation of drinking water systems. First Nations leaders have expressed interest in determining and devel - oping priorities and strategies for safe drinking water legislation and a framework that would effectively support safe and sustainable drink-ing water for communities. First Nations water operators in BC and Yukon have launched their own network (First Nations' Operators Water Net) to support and advocate for their profession. This great work needs to be sus- tained and expanded. Community or public water systems may not ad-dress all water needs in First Nations communities; the federal fiduciary responsibility to these communities needs to be extended to fund and support smaller systems, which also serve residents in First Nations com-munities. We also need to recognize that First Nations view water holisti - cally, extending beyond what comes from the tap to source water and is-sues that arise in watersheds. Joint collaboration across First Nations communities, local governments, provincial ministries and regional health authorities, and land owners is needed to achieve effective source water protection. While supporting the continued drive to improve services, we also need to highlight what is going well in First Nations communities. The de-velopment of highly skilled women and men as water treatment plant op-erators and caretakers of their water, installation of modern-day treatment facilities, and a supportive network of community, government, and FNHA staff have all contributed to a reduc-tion in the number and duration of ad-visories. The excellent work carried out by First Nations water treatment plant operators, community-based drinking water monitors, community health staff, and many others in com-munities who support provision of safe drinking water is but one exam-ple of First Nations individuals and communities leading wellness.

They enable doctors to rely on each other for practice cover - age, and to support each other with clinical services to meet the compre-hensive care needs of their patients. The supportive, connected nature of physician networks will place them at the foundation of primary care net-works as they are built. In physician networks, GPs can increase their capacity to support pa-tients, access shared team-based care resources, provide peer support for clinical matters, and increase work-life balance. A network can comprise a group of doctors and a combina-tion of relationships: GP to GP, GP to specialist, and patient medical home to patient medical home. Physicians determine the makeup of their net-works and decide which services they will collectively provide to best sup-port local needs. Patients benefit from these relationships through increased access to continuous, comprehensive primary care, improved coordination of specialist care, and better access to after-hours care. Physicians in some areas are al- ready part of a network or on-call group, or are starting networks with colleagues to provide care for specific patient populations, including resi-dential care, maternity, in-hospital, and end-of-life care. In many commu-nities, divisions of family practice are actively involved in (or planning for) the development of formal physician networks with funding from the GPSC and Shared Care.

Division maternity care projects The division and Shared Care mater - nity care projects highlighted in the GPSC column in the January/Feb-ruary issue of the BCMJ 1 represent networks that enable family doctors, midwives, and obstetricians to pro-vide coverage for patients\u2014and for each other. Maternity care provides an example of how networks can be organized in different ways\u2014for in-stance, the Burnaby Maternity Clin-ic is a GP-to-GP network, while the South Okanagan Maternity Centre networks GPs and midwives to pro-vide patients with collaborative care. Richmond Neighbourhood Networks Richmond is a city that comprises many small, unique neighborhoods, each with distinct socioeconomic, cultural, language, and health care needs. To enhance primary care cap-acity in these diverse communities, the Richmond Division of Family Practice created Neighbourhood Net-works 2\u2014geographically clustered groups of GPs\u2014with the belief that enhancing support to physicians at the practice level would create paral-lel effects of enhanced patient experi-ence. 3 By fostering and supporting collegial relationships between local GPs, Neighbourhood Networks cre-ate a systemic approach to coordin-ating multidisciplinary care, patient attachment, physician recruitment, peer support, and practice coverage. The division has created a series of papers outlining what they have learned and recommendations for creating Neighbourhood Networks, which are available on their website. 2 Chilliwack Gender Care Network The Chilliwack Division of Family Practice supports the Chilliwack Gender Care Network, with the goal of improving the quality of care for transgender, two-spirit, and gender-diverse clients in the community. This network consists of a physician and nurse practitioner who have received additional training through the PHSA for hormone readiness assessment, hormone therapy, and surgical readi-ness assessments. Network members are also members of the Chilliwack Gender Care Committee, which in-cludes patients, parents, service pro-viders, and organizations that work with transgender clients to promote public education and stigma reduc-tion.

The division has sponsored two education sessions for physicians on addiction medicine and is planning to conduct a short research project that will track patients who go to an ER in part due to substance use. Surrey-North Delta Opioid Agonist Therapy Network The Surrey-North Delta Division's Opioid Agonist Therapy Network is a mentoring and support system for family physicians interested in tak-ing on patients who need opioid ag-onist therapy, with a focus on stigma reduction, trauma-informed practice, and effective buprenorphine-naloxone therapy in full-service family practice. Victoria and South Island FP Palliative Network The Victoria and South Island Div- isions of Family Practice have col-laborated to create the FP Palliative Network. This network links togeth-er a group of geographically diverse South Island and Victoria physicians who accept unattached end-of-life patients based on referrals from Vic - toria Hospice and the BCCA Pain and Symptom Management Clinic. Physician networks are an evolv- ing area of work, and these are just a few examples that have been formed around the province. As work unfolds on primary care networks\u2014including data gathering and evaluation\u2014more information will become available about how connecting GPs, special-ists, nurse practitioners, and other care providers through physician net-works will help to improve physician experience and patient access to care in communities around the province.

Doctors Helping Doctors83 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 2, march 2019 bcmj.orgobituaries Dr Peter Doris 1948-2018 Dr Peter Doris grew up in Ontario. He was a medical student at Queen's University at Kingston and later a general surgeon at affiliated hospi - tals. Mid-career he moved to Surrey, BC, where he was quickly recognized as an outstanding surgeon, especially for abdominal pathology. On appoint-ment as chief of the Department of Surgery at Surrey Memorial Hospital, he addressed the management of sur - gical services in the emergency room and moved to 24-hour surgical care. As surgical chief he found himself on numerous committees, where he was a popular advocate. On executive committees he found himself increas-ingly involved with Surrey Memorial Hospital's role in the rapid expansion of Surrey's community and its multi - cultural development. Dr Doris's dream was that Surrey Memorial would be the link, as a teaching hospi-tal, between the University of British Columbia and the Surrey campus of Simon Fraser University. He had the support of the medical staff but not of the administration, which over subse-quent years removed physicians from roles in the hospital's development. Despite having a busy surgical practice, his door was always open to colleagues seeking advice on patients or hospital issues, and he continued to press for physician involvement in the hospital's development. He spoke about the role of the physician in the hospital system at the 2016 College of Physicians and Surgeons of BC annual general meeting, and his pre-sentation was so popular that it was repeated twice during the day. Struck by sudden illness, Dr Do- ris lingered in hospital care, and it is saddening that in his final months he didn't have the attention he needed and deserved. \u2014John O'Brien-Bell, MB Surrey Dr Ralph William Spitzer 1918-2018 Dr Ralph William Spitzer passed away in Victoria, BC, on 17 October 2018 at the age of 100. He is survived by his loving family: wife, Hisako Kurotaki; daughter, Eloise (Rob); and granddaughter, Kali. Ralph was pre-deceased by his first wife of 59 years, Therese, and their son, Matthew. Ralph's contribution to building a superb laboratory medicine-chemical pathology service in the Lower Main-land was immense. I was fortunate to have been chosen by him in the postdoctoral program in clinical bio-chemistry that he had set up at Royal Columbian Hospital in 1970; thus, my career in the medical biochemis-try field was launched because of his vision. I am eternally grateful. Ralph was a unique individual with a strong commitment to a plural-istic and diverse society. He lived his values and supported many initiatives that were embedded in those values. He had a brilliant mind, graduat - ing from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, with a BSc in chemistry at the age of 20, and completing a PhD at the age of 23. His PhD mentor was Dr Linus Pauling, winner of two Nobel prizes. Ralph pursued an academic career at Oregon State University as an associate professor in biochemis-try. In 1949, he became a victim of the McCarthy era in the United States and was fired from the university for his political views. In 1950, while travel-ing and lecturing in Europe, he was arrested, incarcerated, and held in iso-lation in Rotterdam. His passport con-fiscated, he was forced to return to the United States. In 1954 Ralph decided to move to Canada, which benefited Canada greatly. He completed medi-cal school at the University of Mani-toba, and in 1958 the family moved to New Westminster, where he began his long career as a chemical patholo-gist with the newly formed group, Dr C.J. Coady and Associates, which operated BC Biomedical Medical Laboratories and provided consulta-tive services to the Royal Columbian Hospital regional laboratory system. Ralph contributed to the academ - ic world and was a professor at the UBC School of Medicine. He was a true pioneer, being the first medical biochemist in the province, devel - oping both a high-level community-based laboratory service as well as contributing to academic excellence. He took the practice of biochemis-try to patients' bedsides, thus ben-efiting thousands of patients who received care at the Royal Columbian Hospital. Laboratory medicine also Continued on page 8484 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 2, march 2019 bcmj.orgobituaries UCC hospitals across Canada. A gift- ed orator, he spent the next 24 years traveling to UCC medical outposts from BC to Newfoundland negotiat-ing the building of new hospitals and acquiring new equipment, recruiting dedicated staff, encouraging local hir - ing, and ensuring local representation on hospital boards. He continued to practise medicine as a relief physician wherever needed. While in Vancouver, Don served on the boards of St. Michael's Cen-tre, Chalmers Lodge, St. Stephen's United Church, and the Alcohol-Drug Education Service. A proponent of full-service family medicine, Don received his CCFP in 1971 and his FCFP in 1974. Beginning in 1980 he served two terms as president of the BC College of Family Physicians, and in 1986 was president of the Col-lege of Family Physicians Canada. A champion of the 2-year family prac - tice residency, he spent 25 years as a clinical instructor for the UBC Medi-cal School. Don received an honor - ary doctorate of divinity from Union College, UBC, in 1970, and the Da-vid M. Bachop Gold Medal in 1989 in recognition of \"his successful and resourceful efforts to bring care to small, isolated communities.\" Don and June will be forever missed, but their legacy of hospital-ity, selflessness, humor, grace, and excellence in delivering medical care to those who needed it most remains. More of their story can be found in the book Healing in the Wilderness, by Rev. Bob Burrows. A memorial ser - vice and celebration of this extraor - dinary life was held at Trinity United Memorial Church in Abbotsford on 2 February. \u2014Elizabeth J. Watt, MD Abbotsfordbenefited from Ralph's creative en-ergy, innovative mind, and commit-ment to excellence. He was generous in teaching and mentored several postdoctoral students for successful careers in clinical biochemistry. Ralph was a man of many seasons. Besides being a brilliant scientist, cli - nician, and teacher, he had many out-side interests. He was an avid skier and a mountaineer. He became a bon-sai gardener, and he learned to play the organ in retirement, building an organ in his living room that had over 2000 pipes. He traveled widely well into his 90s, visiting Europe, Turkey, China, Japan, Southeast Asia, India, South America, and Antarctica. Stenciled at the base of Ralph's massive pipe organ is a phrase that perfectly captured his perspective on life: ars longa, vita brevis (art is long, life is short). He was loved and ad-mired by his colleagues, friends, and family. He will be missed by his col-leagues and students, whose lives he influenced significantly. \u2014Arun K. Garg, PhD, MD New Westminster Dr W. Donald Watt 1924-2018 It is with sadness that we announce the passing of Dr (William) Donald Watt. Don was born in Allendale (now Bar - rie) Ontario on 14 November 1924, and passed away peacefully in his sleep on 29 December 2018 at the age of 94 in Abbotsford, BC. He was predeceased by his wife of 57 years, (Victoria) June Watt; his parents, Rev (William) John Watt and Edith Cath-erine Watt; his six older siblings and their partners; and his first grandchild, Lorraine. He is survived by his chil - dren, (William) David Watt (Cindy), George Donald Watt (Ying), Victoria Joy Manson (Bradley), and Elizabeth June Watt (Denis Durand). Don joined the Royal Canadian Air Force after high school and re-ceived his wings as World War II was ending. He graduated from the Uni-versity of Toronto with his MD in 1950, then interned and worked at the Wellesley Hospital, Hospital for Sick Children, and Toronto Western Hos-pital for the next 2 years where he met June, a nurse and former World War II Wren (member of the Women's Royal Canadian Naval Service). In 1952 Don began a 38-year ca- reer working for the United Church of Canada (UCC), Board of Home Mis-sions. Initially placed as the lone MD on the Queen Charlotte Islands (now Haida Gwaii), he delivered medical care via plane, truck, and boat, with June volunteering by his side. He was soon assigned the position of coro-ner, justice of the peace, and medi-cal health officer. He set up clinics in Sandspit, Skidegate Village, Mas-set, and in logging camps at Juskatla and Cumshewa Inlet, and facilitated building the 21-bed Queen Charlotte City Hospital, which opened in 1955. In 1956 Don moved to Bella Coo- la, where he spent 7 years as physi-cian, hospital superintendent, and caregiver to lighthouses and remote logging camps in the area. He was later adopted into the Nuxalk (Bella Coola) Nation by the Walkus and Ed-gar families and named Nooskumiich (one who heals with his hands) and Nenetsmlayc (one who brings back to life) at the opening of the new Bella Coola Hospital in 1980.

Frailty is a state of increased vulner - ability and decreased physiologic re- serve that impedes the body's ability to withstand and recover from minor challenges. 1 Frailty is multidimen- sional and consists of psychological, social, and physical aspects, and puts people at risk of adverse health out - comes, including falls, disability, ad-mission to hospital, and death, and has been reviewed in the CMAJ. 2 Despite what one might intuit, frailty is not an inevitable part of ag-ing, although its prevalence does rise with age, from 16% of people 65 years old to over 50% of those over 85. 3 Mounting evidence suggests that early identification and intervention can not only slow the progression of frailty but even prevent it. The interventions include physical activ-ity, nutritional support, and social networking. 4 How can frailty be assessed? One can start assessing frailty with the PRISMA 7 questionnaire5 and the Timed Up and Go test.6 Additionally, the Clinical Frailty Scale, developed and validated in 2005, is still in use to-day. More recently, the Fraser Health Authority launched the Community Actions and Resources Empowering Seniors (CARES) model in BC, a col-laborative primary care model using an electronic comprehensive geriatric assessment and coaching to prevent frailty. A patient's comprehensive geriatric assessment is loaded into the physician's EMR, which calcu-lates a frailty index. Once the frailty index is determined, supports such as health coaches can be put in place to assist the pre-frail senior. Preliminary data from a pilot CARES study show that with 6 months of coaching, the number of participants exercising fre-quently increased by 65%, and walk-ing independently increased by 30%. Moreover, participants endorsing a positive health attitude increased by 59%. 7 What programs are feasible to address frailty? In a current project targeting sen- iors (but including other ages), the White Rock-South Surrey Division of Family Practice partnered with the Peace Arch Hospital and Community Foundation to offer subsidized per - sonal exercise prescriptions through the MOVE for LIFE program. 8 Other divisions can team up with local groups such as the YMCA to offer programs suitable for their commun-ities, and many already are. This article is the opinion of the Athletics and Recreation Committee, a subcommit-tee of Doctors of BC's Council on Health Promotion, and is not necessarily the opin-ion of Doctors of BC. This article has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.For a home-based program, the Go4Life website9 from the National Institute for Aging provides seniors with simple tools to prevent frailty and maintain independence. This in-cludes exercises and videos focused on improving flexibility, strength, balance, and endurance. How early should frailty be addressed? We know that obesity rates are in- creasing in both children and adults, and obesity is associated with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and musculoskeletal impairments. We also know exercise improves cardiorespiratory fitness, enhances psychosocial well-being, and reduces obesity. 10 Habits established in child- hood and reinforced throughout life are more likely to endure later in life. Additionally, regular exercisers are less likely to live with chronic dis-eases that contribute to frailty. BC pro-grams such as Be Active Every Day 11 are one way for family physicians and educators to collaborate in establish-ing healthy exercise and eating habits early in school-age children. As our population ages, frailty becomes an increasingly prevalent condition that threatens the health of seniors and the viability of our health care system. We know it can be pre - vented by targeted assessments at the primary care level with specific inter - ventions that can begin early in life. Preventing frailty is consistent with the foundational concepts of the pa-tient medical home, and should be considered in the evolution of pri-mary care networks and public policy decisions. \u2014Steven Larigakis, MD References on page 86Despite what one might intuit, frailty is not an inevitable part of aging, although its prevalence does rise with age, from 16% of people 65 years old to over 50% of those over 85. 86 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 2, march 2019 bcmj.orgReferences 1.

The review article, \"Wom- en's perspectives about cannabis use during pregnancy and the post-partum period: An integrative re - view,\" is available online at www .sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743518303773?via%3Dihub (login required). Preventing overdose deaths among people recently released from a correctional facility A new project aimed at supporting people transitioning back to their communities when they are released from a correctional facility could pre-vent overdoses and help clients get on a healthier path. Roughly two-thirds of British Co- lumbians who died of an illegal drug overdose between 1 January 2016 and 31 July 2017 had recent contact with the criminal justice system, accord-ing to a death review panel report 1 released by the BC Coroners Service in 2018. Of those, 10% (333 people) died within their first month of release from a correctional facility. Five new community transition teams stationed throughout BC aim to address this problem by helping peo-ple with opioid-use disorders access treatment in their communities after release from a corrections facility. The teams are currently stationed in Surrey, Prince George, Kamloops, Nanaimo, and Port Coquitlam. Each consists of a social worker and a peer\u2014a person with lived experience news Some pregnant women don't believe cannabis is harmful to their fetus Up to one-third of pregnant women do not believe cannabis is harmful to their fetus, according to a review by Uni-versity of British Columbia research-ers. In some cases, women perceived a lack of communication from their health care providers about the risks of cannabis as an indication that the drug is safe to use during pregnancy. The findings are outlined in a new review, published in Preventive Medicine, in which UBC researchers sought to identify the latest evidence on women's perspectives on the health aspects of cannabis use during preg-nancy and postpartum, and whether their perceptions influence decision making about using the drug. The research suggests that, over the past decade, more women seem to be us-ing cannabis during pregnancy, even though evidence of its safety is lim - ited and conflicting. For the review, researchers identified six studies con-ducted in the United States that looked at women's perceptions about canna-bis use during pregnancy. Across the studies, the rate of cannabis use among pregnant women varied considerably. In a large US population-based study, nearly 4% of women self-reported us-ing cannabis within the past month, while 7% self-reported using cannabis within the past year. In another study that saw researchers also test hair and urine samples, the rate of cannabis use increased to 28%. Pregnant cannabis users were more likely to be under age 25, unem-ployed, single or uninsured, African-American, and to have low income and education, or use other substanc-es such as tobacco and alcohol. A di-agnosis of anxiety or depression was also associated with cannabis use dur - ing pregnancy. Researchers found that cannabis use rates were highest dur - ing the first trimester (7.4%) and low-est during the third trimester (1.8%). Most pregnant users reported using cannabis to treat nausea early in their pregnancy. In one study involving 306 pregnant women, 35% reported being cannabis users when they real-ized they were pregnant. Two-thirds of those women quit after finding out they were pregnant, but among those who continued to use cannabis, half reported using almost daily or twice a week. When women were asked about their perception of general harm asso-ciated with cannabis use, 70% of both pregnant and nonpregnant cannabis users responded that they perceived slight or no risk of harm. In another study, when asked if they believed cannabis is harmful to a baby during pregnancy, 30% of pregnant women responded \"no.\" When women were asked to identify substances most likely to harm the baby during preg-nancy, 70% chose alcohol, 16% chose tobacco, and 2% chose cannabis (see Figure ). While research on the health ef - fects of cannabis is limited, some studies have shown an increased risk of problems for pregnant women, including anemia, low birth weight, stillbirth, and newborn admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. Due to the risk of potential problems, many professional organizations, including the Society of Obstetricians and Gyn-aecologists of Canada, recommend women not use cannabis when trying to conceive, during pregnancy, and while breastfeeding. Still, some wom-en reported that not having specific counseling provided about the risks of cannabis use suggests that the drug is safe. One finding revealed that some people don't consider cannabis to be a drug, making it especially important for health care providers to ask specif-ic questions about cannabis use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

The teams will work with clients for approximately 30 days following their release to connect with a commu-nity physician, fill prescriptions, and access other recovery supports. Recently incarcerated clients at greater risk of overdose Dr Nader Sharifi, medical director for Correctional Health Services and ad-dictions lead for BC Mental Health news and Substance Use Services, reports that currently about 40% of people in corrections facilities receive opi-oid agonist treatment, which includes medications such as Suboxone and methadone to treat opioid use disor - der. He says people are at heightened risk when they leave corrections and no longer have access to the facility's physician. Additional risk factors include lowered tolerance and the trauma associated with release.Role of peers in recovery is vital Andrew MacFarlane, provincial exec-utive director for Correctional Health Services, has spent 20 years working with people with mental health and substance use issues, and the last 5 working with people on Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. MacFarlane and his team designed the community transition team project after consult-ing with regional health authorities The Canada India Network Society was established in 2010 to connect leaders from Canada and India in or - der to build collaborative opportun-ities among the countries' academic institutions and industries. The Can-ada India Network Initiative 2018 was the society's third conference. Though focused on a subset of the South Asian population, the confer - ence vision was global engagement and building links between people through health care. The conference started with wel- come remarks from the Honourable Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr Arun Garg, the conference chair. Sessions included: War on Diabetes. Deljit Bains, leader at the South Asian Health Institute, advocated for transfor - mation in the community in health promotion through direct engage-ment at places like gurudwaras and temples. Dr Gulzar Cheema shared his work on the interCul-tural Online Health Network, a community-driven health-promo-tion initiative that supports mul-ticultural communities, patients, and caregivers across BC to opti-mize chronic disease prevention and self-management. Sean McK-elvey shared his work in making diabetes care drug-free. The final speaker, Dr JST Thakur of India, addressed the approaching tsuna-mi of diabetes. Mental Illness. Dr Nitasha Puri spoke about the need for immedi - ate action in the prevention and cure of addictions in the context of her work with Fraser Health's Ro-shni Clinic. Dr Suman Kollipara focused on alternative and inte-grated approaches like meditation and self-empowerment tools for prevention of mental illness. Public Health Approaches to Pal-liative Care in India and BC, look-ing at the work done by the Two Worlds Cancer Collaboration, was presented by Drs Doris Barwich and Gillian Fyles and facilitated by Dr Simon Sutcliffe. Leadership in Health. Drs Arvind Lal, Anupam Sibal, and Robert Woollard brought decades of expe-rience to shed light on the need for better practices in health care. Empowering Physicians. This ses- sion was presented using the LEADS framework, including principles of leading self, engaging others, achieving results, developing coali-tions, and transforming systems. Integrative Medicine and Health. Medical professionals, research scientists, traditional Chinese med-icine practitioners, and yoga prac-titioners reflected on their personal journeys as well as their patients' journeys. Presentations covered the importance of integrative medicine in the prevention of dementia, sup-portive cancer care, food as medi - cine, traditional Chinese medicine, Indigenous medicine, and inte-grated yoga therapy. The overall message was that chronic disease requires an integrative approach to care. Technology and Innovation. Dis-cussions centred on artificial intel - ligence in health care, taking ac-tion against tuberculosis, the role of technology in access to health information, mobile technologies, and using neuroethology in youth depression and addiction. Kathy Kinloch, BCIT President, and the Honourable Bruce Ralston, Minis-ter of Jobs, Trade and Technology, were featured speakers. Two roundtable discussions on technology and integrative medi - cine focused on identifying re-search opportunities between India and Canada\u2014building bridges be-tween modern innovation and an-cient technologies.

UBC research examines living well while dying A University of British Columbia pro- fessor in the Faculty of Health and So-cial Development, School of Nursing, Kelowna, has determined that people diagnosed with terminal cancer\u2014who have hope, positivity, and family sup-port\u2014are able to live well during the advanced stage of the disease. Carole Robinson, professor emeri- tus with the UBC Okanagan School of Nursing, recently published a paper with co-authors explaining the pro-cess of living well with an awareness of dying. Robinson notes that glob-ally there are 14.1 million new cancer cases diagnosed each year, 8.2 million cancer deaths, and 32.6 million peo-ple living with cancer. Historically, re-searchers have studied the concept of living well with a chronic illness, but not specifically cancer. Robinson says those studies convey the idea it may be possible to live well with advanced cancer, but little is known about how it is done or how to support it. The study analyzed 22 interviews with Spanish adults involved in previ-ous research that explored their expe-rience of living with advanced cancer. The researchers found the partici-pants engaged in a five-phase itera-tive process: struggling, accepting, living with advanced cancer, sharing the illness experience, and recon-structing life. This process revolved around participants' awareness of dy-ing, which differed from people living with chronic illness, and was a unique aspect of this new research. Each phase was revisited and, as the disease advanced, living well got more challenging. Participants talked about strategies for living with ad-vanced cancer, including making life adjustments, maintaining a positive attitude, normalizing, and hoping. Over time, participants realized struggling against the disease created additional difficulties. They under - stood it was counterproductive so they made a conscious choice to let go of struggling. Some referred to it as being the only choice they could make while living with the uncertainty of advanced cancer. This enabled accepting their life circumstances at some level and learning to live alongside their illness. Robinson says that the importance of family love and support cannot be underestimated. For all the participants, she adds, awareness of dying led them to focus on living well. Sharing the ex-perience with loved ones softened suf-fering remarkably. They were aware they did not have time to lose. Robinson says the key takeaways to living well encompass a balance between depen-dence and independence, being able to see the positive, and maintaining hope even in the end stages of the disease. The study, \"People with advanced cancer: The process of living well with awareness of dying,\" was published in Qualitative Health Research.

The following concepts are empha-sized in these documents. Rest is no longer recommended for an indefinite period of time. 4 Af- ter an initial 24 to 48 hours of rest, the worker should be activated. Activa-tion begins using a concept of symp - tom threshold wherein key symptoms are provoked at certain levels of ag-gravation. Producing a slight aggrava-tion of symptoms is not harmful and is thought that, over time, will set the threshold higher and higher until nor - mal activities both in and out of work are no longer symptom provoking. Individuals should gradually re- sume normal physical and cognitive work-related activities. While this is sometimes difficult to initiate and un-derstand, a rule of thumb that I have incorporated into my practice is to be-gin with the 10-20-30 rule. Cognitive activity can be initiated in 10-minute periods followed by 30-minute rest periods. If doing this three successive times does not exacerbate the symp-toms, progress to 20-minute activity periods followed by 30-minute rest periods, three times.

Early introduction of aerobic physical activity is a major factor in rapid recovery. Lawrence and col-leagues reported that, \"for each suc-cessive day in delay to initiation of aerobic exercise, individuals had a less favorable recovery trajectory.\" 5 Dr John Leddy of the University of Buffalo Concussion Clinic pioneered the concept of subsymptom exercise threshold rehabilitation. 6 Patients can be exercise-challenged to determine the level, duration, and intensity of activity at which symptoms appear and peak no more than 2 out of 10 above their baseline symptoms. The doctor can then prescribe an indi - vidualized exercise regimen, gradu - ally increasing intensity and duration to the endpoint of submaximal heart rate exercise for 30 minutes without symptom exacerbation. This has been shown to accelerate recovery. Interventions that are associated with better outcomes include early education and early psychological and physical support. 7,8 Setting a pa- tient's expectations of recovery and reentry into the workplace and es - tablishing a goal of returning to their previous job early in the course of treatment and management is rec - ommended. Occupational therapists have a 4-P strategy for assisting re - turn to work: prioritize, pace, plan, and position (that is, change positions frequently and switch up activities). 9 This approach can be initiated by the patient's primary care physician and supported by allied health care pro-fessionals such as physiotherapists or occupational therapists. Primary care physicians can play a significant role in identifying injured workers with significant multiple risk modifiers who should be consid-ered for early referral to a multidisci-plinary clinic, such as WorkSafeBC's Head Injury Assessment and Treat-ment Service (HIATS). Significant modifiers include a history of prior concussions or migraine headaches, and patients for whom headache is the predominant symptom.
