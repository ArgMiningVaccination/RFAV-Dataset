In recent years, breast nodules, thyroid nodules, and uterine myoma are more commonly encountered in clinical prac- tice. They are commonly seen among women aged 30 to 40 years.1-3Breast nodules and thyroid nodules may turn into cancer. Although uterine myoma is benign, it may causesymptoms like hypermenorrhea, peripheral organ compres- sion, and infertility, two or more of which are often found in one of the patients. Dong et al 4conrmed that the incidence of these three diseases was positively correlated, which seriously harmed the physical and mental health of women patients who desire treatment. From the view of modernmedicine, these three diseases belong to different depart- ments. In treating them, close follow-up or surgery is often required. However, the ef cacy was not satisfactory and patients suffered from heavy mind-load. When they turned to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for help, patients mostly hope their diseases to be treated with one prescrip-tion. How to control or eliminate the nodules with the theory of syndrome differentiation is a problem to be solved in TCM clinical practice. Breast nodules, thyroid nodules, and uterine myoma belong to\"accumulation pattern \"in TCM theory. \"Accumulation \" generally refers to all the masses formed in the human body. According to their characteristics and location, they can be divided into concretion, conglomeration, cord-like mass, lump,tumor, and cancer. 5Accumulation in blood level is a tangible mass and is xed while accumulation in qi level may migrate. According to the historical literature on the etiology, patho-genesis, and clinical characteristics of breast nodules, thyroid nodules, and uterus myoma, these three kinds of diseases can be classi ed according to benign accumulation patterns. The research team has found in TCM clinical practice that the benign accumulation pattern in young and middle-aged wom- en is closely related to yang stagnation.Keywords yang stagnation accumulation pattern thyroid nodule nodules and uterus accumulation pattern unblocking yang method six depressionAbstract Benign breast nodules, thyroid nodules, and myoma of the uterus are similar in etiology and pathogenesis. These three diseases are classi ed according to accumulation patterns in traditional Chinese medicine theory and can be treated with the same prescription. Yang stagnation is the basic pathogenesis of benign accumulationpatterns in young and middle-aged women. Its treatment principle should be\"unblocking yang, \"and its treating methods should include diffusing yang, warming yang, dissolving phlegm, and dissipating st asis, which can unblock yang qi and dissolve stasis. Meanwhile, heart-nourishing and mind-calming ingredients should be includedin the prescriptions to improve the clinical manifestations. received June 20, 2022 accepted after revisionAugust 29, 2022 article published online 2023DOI https://doi.org/ 10.1055/s-0043-1764129.

However, there are several clinical manifestations, such as irritability, facial acne, thirst, and constipation, which cannot be explained by the theory of \"liver fails to govern the flow of qi.\" It can be learned from related literature that Chinese medicine can alleviate patients 'symptoms of breast diseases, thyroid nodules, and uterus adenomyosis by using the \"six depression \"theory.8-10The above-mentioned symptoms which could hardly be explained by \"failure of liver to govern theflow of qi \"can also be effectively alleviated with the theory of yang stagnation.11,12The six stagnations, however, is part of the yang stagnation theory.13Guided by Prof. Wanlin Wang, the national famous TCM expert, the research team has been working for many years on benign accumula- tion patterns in young and middle-aged women and haspointed out that yang stagnation is the basic pathogenesis. Andao Wang stated in Discourse on Tracing Back to the Medical Classics (Yi Jing Su Hui Ji) that \"All diseases occur because of stagnation. \"Based on this, he made prescriptions to alleviate the symptoms of many female patients with this pattern. Therefore, the research team believes that mostclinical manifestations of benign accumulation patterns in young and middle-aged women are caused by stagnated yang qi which cannot be propelled to the whole body. Many modern practitioners also treat benign accumula- tion patterns in young and middle-aged women from the point of stagnation. Academician Tong 14believes that the etiology of the triad is qi stagnation, blood stagnation, and phlegm stagnation, which shall be treated with the mainprinciple of releasing stagnation, dissolving phlegm, dissi- pating masses, and unblocking the meridians. The main treatment methods shall be dissolving the stagnation andtonifying the de ciency. In treating thyroid nodules, mam- mary hyperplasia, and uterine myoma, professor Lin 15 believes that it is most important to unblock qi movement and restore its function of ascending, descending, exiting, and entering. Methods that dissolve phlegm, invigorate blood, and dissipate stasis are all effective. It can be observedfrom the formulas that mostly have unblocking ingredients in them, which implies that benign accumulation patterns shall be treated from the view of yang stagnation. Yang stagnation means that yang qi is blocked in the body and fails to warm. Although yang qi is blocked, it is not decient. Young and middle-aged women are in a physio- logical period when yang qi is exuberant. In the Yellow Emperor 's Inner Classic (Huang Di Nei Jing) , they are described as\"At the age of 28, their muscles and bones are strong and hair grows best; at the age of 35, large intestine meridian and stomach meridian turn weak, their faces start to turn yellow and hairs start to fall. \"With improving living conditions andlife expectancy nowadays, the average age of natural meno- pause for Chinese women is 49 /C63.7 years old. 16Therefore, modern women are still in their prime at their thirties, and their yang qi is not de cient. According to clinical observa- tion, yang de ciency manifestations such as cold hands and feet, sore waist and knees, clear and long urine, and loose stools are not common in young and middle-aged women. Therefore, the research team believes that most symptomsthat are seen in patients with yang stagnation are not caused by yang de ciency but by too much yang qi blocked inside, which cannot be dispersed. Discussion on the Theory of Yang Stagnation Literature Review on Yang Stagnation Theory \"Yang stagnation \"originated from the Yellow Emperor 'sI n n e r Classic (Huang Di Nei Jing) . The book recorded many causes of stagnation of yang qi, like wind being restrained by coldness, coldness stagnating with dampness, pathogen qi invading the body, and coldness remaining in the stomach. Practi-tioners in later generations discussed yang stagnation from the theory of \"dispersing the stagnated re,\"which overrode yang stagnation with re stagnation, thus hindered the development of yang stagnation. By the time of Song and Yuan Dynasties, practitioners had understood deeper about yang stagnation theory. In Key to Diagnosis and Treatment of Children 's Diseases (Xiao Er Yao Zheng Zhi Jue) , Yi Qian noted that the stagnation of lung re should be treated with White-Draining Powder (Xie Bai San),hidden re in the stomach by Yellow-Draining Powder (Xie Huang San), and stagnated re in heart meridian by Red- Guiding Powder (Dao Chi San). Danxi Zhu discussed yangstagnation with the six-stagnation theory. Practitioners in Ming Dynasty took depression as the primary cause of stagnation. For example, Xianke Zhao mentioned in the treatise of depression syndrome of the Key Link of Medicine (Yi Guan) that \"Depression causes dampness stagnation, which turns into heat, heat stagnation produces phlegm and blood circulation will be affected, blood stagnation affects food digestion. These six symptomsplay as causes and results. \"This point of view further restricted the development of the theory of yang stagnation. Since Qing Dynasty, yang stagnation has gradually becomemature. For example, Mengyao He said in A Steppingstone of Medicine (Yi Bian) that\"Stagnation means blockage, which is the cause of many diseases. \" With the continuous development of the yang stagnation theory, the idea of TCM diagnosis and treatment has been expanded and the system of TCM clinical syndrome differ-entiation has been enriched. Circulation Is the Key Factor to Yang Qi Through ascending, descending, exiting, and entering, yang qi plays a dominating role in the growing process of the human body. Yang qi is active, it goes in all directions andenters all organs and collaterals. It moves ceaselessly in the body. Once it is stagnated, diseases may occur. 17InSu Wen: Liu Wei Zhi Da Lun (Plain Conversations:Major Discussion on Chinese Medicine and Natural Products V ol. 3 No. 1/2023 \u00a9 2023. The Author(s).Treating Benign Accumulation Pattern in Young and Middle-Aged Women Zhang et al. e10 the Abstruseness of the Six Kinds of Qi) it is stated that \" Without exiting and entering, there is no developing process;without ascending and descending, there is no growing circle. Ascending, descending, exiting and entering exist in all living things. \" In qi transformation of human body, qi pertains to yang while essence pertains to yin. Qi keeps moving and consumes energy, which turns into yin essence to nourish organs andmeridians. After metabolism, yin essence turns into qi which promotes the human body to growth. Only through this continuous circulation can a status of dynamic balance bekept and a physiological status of calm yin and sound yang be obtained. Therefore, circulation is the key to yang qi. Yang Qi Functions to Warm and Dissipate Su Wen:Sheng Qi Tong Tian Lun (Plain Conversations:Discus- sion on Interrelationship Between Life and Nature) states that only when yin is calm and yang is sound, essence-spirit can be normal, which emphasizes that the dynamic balance of yin and yang is the secret to human health and longevity. Thebook also states that yang transforms into qi, while yin constitutes form, which stresses that the basis of qi transfor- mation is yang and the basis of formation is yin. Only throughwarming, scattering, and circulating in the human body can qi be normally transformed. Only in the same way can the nutrient substance go to its proper location. With no stagna-tion of yin-essence, there will not be the pathogenic status of yang transforming into qi or yin constituting form. Normal human life activities are indispensable to the warming function of yang qi, which covers the whole body. When yang qi fails to warm the organs, functions that heart governs spirit, lung frees and regulates the water-ways, spleen governs transportation and transformation, liver governs the free flow of qi, the kidney stores essence will be affected and all diseases emerge. Therefore, yang qi has to keep warming the organs and meridians, as well as warming qi, blood, and body fluids. Yang Stagnation May Cause Phlegm and Stasis, Making a Vicious Circle of Yang Stagnation -Phlegm Stasis -Worse Stagnation There is a saying in Su Wen:Sheng Qi Tong Tian Lun (Plain Conversations:Discussion on Interrelationship Between Lifeand Nature) that \"The relation of yang qi and human body is similar to the relation of the sun and the sky. Once yang qi is weakened, human health will be affected. \"It emphasizes that yang qi is the basis of human life activities. Once it fails to function properly, human life will be threatened. It is also stated in Su Wen:Bao Ming Quan Xing Lun (Plain Conversa- tions:Discussion on Preserving Health and Protecting Life) that \"Yang is active and is the source of human energy. \"Yang qi is active and circulates around the whole body, propelling thetransformation of blood essence and body fluid. It nourishes limbs, bones, and zang-fu organs. Once there is stagnation, blood essence and body fluid will not be dissipated to the whole body to nourish zang-fu organs and meridians. They stagnate in the body and tend to produce phlegm and stasis, which may turn into accumulation. It is stated in CompleteMedical Records by Tianshi Ye (Ye Tian Shi Yi An Da Quan) that \"Turbid yin coagulates where yang qi fails to reach. \"Intro- duction to Medicine (Yi Xue Ru Men) points out that \"Qi cannot become a mass. Masses are formed by tangible substances like food accumulation or blood stasis. Theycoagulate and become conglomerations. \" When phlegm stasis is formed and blocks organs and meridians, it affects the circulation of yang qi. When yang qiis stagnated, yang stagnation will be more serious and phlegm stasis in zang-fu organs will be worse. With time it may turn into a vicious circle of yang stagnation -phlegm stasis -worse stagnation. The imbalance of yin and yang in this vicious circle has exceeded the normal self-healing function of the human body and is dif cult to restore. Chronic Yang Stagnation May Turn into Fire Yang qi must flow freely. It cannot be stagnated because stagnation is most likely to be transferred into re and heat. In addition, pathological products like blood stasis and phlegm coagulation may be produced because of yangstagnation. When this kind of qi, phlegm, and stasis are coagulated, it is also easy to turn into pathological status of re and heat. 18There may be many clinical manifestations like feeling irritated easily, bitter taste in the mouth, often feeling thirsty, preference for cold food, getting \"re\"easily, insomnia, profuse dreaming, red tongue with a yellow greasycoating, and rapid wiry pulse. Shimao Li, one of the Masters of Chinese Medicine, stated in Discussing Febrile Disease by Pulse Checking and Syndrome Differentiation (Ping Mai BianZheng Wen Zheng Qiu Suo) that \"Yang qi is the healthy qi of human body, it nourishes organs, limbs and bones by as- cending, descending, exiting, entering and ceaselessly circu-lating ...Once qi movement is constrained ...the stagnation will turn into re.\" In conclusion, only through circulation can yang qi work properly in the human body. Once it stagnates in the organs and meridians, pathogenic products like phlegm-damp andblood stasis will be produced. These pathogenic products, circulating with qi movement, will not stay xed. They become breast nodules when stagnated in mammy glands,thyroid nodules when stagnated in the neck area, and uterus tumor when stagnated in the uterus. When yang qi is stagnated for a long time, it may move from the qi level tothe blood level and keep qi, phlegm, and stasis in the body. These pathogens, cold or warm, will tangle together and could not be eliminated within a short time. These chronicaccumulation disorders may recur after surgery or develop into a malignant tumor. Discussion on Benign Accumulation Pattern with the Theory of Yang Stagnation Treating Breast Nodules, Thyroid Nodules, and Uterus Tumor with the Same Method Breast nodules, thyroid nodule, and uterus tumor are all endocrine diseases. They are affected and regulated by the chain of hypothalamus-hypophysis-gland. Regulating hor- mones shall be the key to treating these three diseases. Chinese Medicine and Natural Products Vol. 3 No. 1/2023 \u00a9 2023. The Author(s).Treating Benign Accumulation Pattern in Young and Middle-Aged Women Zhang et al. e11 Hormones shall be supplemented, accelerated, or inhibited, to make the disordered endocrine system work properly. In TCM theory, there is similar pathogenesis in these three diseases. It is stated in Compiled Case Records of External Syndromes (Wai Zheng Yi An Hui Bian) that \"Breast diseases are all stagnation in the liver and spleen that turn into lumps. \"InFormulas to Aid the Living (Yan Shi Ji Sheng Fang) , it is stated that \"Goiters mainly grow in the necks while tumors are produced in muscles along with qi move- ment. Tumor may bulge abruptly like a plum and grow bigger with time. \"Orthodox Lineage of External Medicine (Wai Ke Zheng Zong) recorded that \"Goiters or tumors are not pro- duced by healthy qi but are formed because of blood stasis in ve organs or turbid qi and phlegm stasis. \"InSecrets to Conception (Yun Yu Xuan Ji) , it is mentioned that \"Most of these diseases are caused by lack of blood and qi in the liver and spleen, or stagnation in these organs. \"From these literature studies, we can conclude that these three diseases are located in the liver and spleen. Depression hurts the liver and anxiety hurts the spleen. Both emotions affect theascending, descending, exiting, and entering of qi. Qi pertains to yang, so the dysfunction of qi movement may produce pathological products like phlegm and stasis, which coagu-late and become an accumulation. The accumulation pattern discussed in this thesis includes different diseases, which, however, not only share the samebasis of physiopathology from the view of modern medicine but also share similar pathogenesis from the view of TCM. Therefore, they can be treated with the same method. Unblocking Yang Is the Key to Treat Yang Stagnation InSu Wen:Sheng Qi Tong Tian Lun (Plain Conversations: Discussion on Interrelationship Between Life and Nature), it points out that yang dominates the balance of yin and yang. The book emphasizes that only when yang qi functions well can health be maintained. Every step of human growth, people 's social life and work, as well as emotion regulation all depends on yang qi to drive. The basic pathogenesis of benign accumulation patterns in young and middle-aged women is yang stagnation. Yang qi shall be active and itdominates ascending, so it cannot be stagnated. Therefore, unblocking yang should be the basis in treating benign accumulation patterns in young and middle-aged women.When yang qi is unblocked, qi and blood can move smoothly, in which circumstance stasis and pathogen toxin are not likely to be formed. Then, the stagnation disease is cured andthe symptoms disappear. Effect of Unblocking Yang T h eP r i m a r yP u r p o s eI st oD i f f u s eY a n gQ i In six stagnation in the Teachings of Danxi (Dan Xi Xin Fa), Danxi Zhu stated that \"When qi and blood are in harmony, no disease will occur; when a man is down in emotion, diseases take place. That is to say that many diseases are caused bydepression. \"It stresses that emotion is a common factor of diseases. Depression is a pathological factor of accumulation syndromes, so diffusing yang qi shall be the rst step toeliminate stagnation. Patients with reversal cold in the limbs or pain in stomach and rib-side areas should be treated withmodi ed Frigid Extremities Powder (Si Ni San) to sooth liver, alleviate stagnation, and unblock yang qi; patients with stagnated re in liver and bladder, whose yang qi is stagnated in bladder meridian, and has symptoms like bitter mouth, constipation, and irritation should be treated with modi ed Minor Bupleurum Decoction (Xiao Chai Hu Tang) to regulateqi movement, dissipate stagnated re in liver and bladder, and unblock yang qi. Diffusing ingredients also be used. Yang Qi Circulates Freely When Phlegm Is Dissolved and Stasis Is Dissipated Diseases are mostly caused by phlegm. Phlegm and dampness are body fluids not being transformed properly. They share the same origin but have their own characteristics. They are bothnonnegligible pathogenic factors in the formation used to dissolve phlegm and unblock yang qi; ve substances powder with Poria (Wu Ling San) should be used to drain dampness and unblock yang qi. Qi and blood shall be circulating ceaselessly. Its circulation is warmed and propelledby yang qi. If yang qi is stagnated, blood would turn into stasis, which shall be eliminated by herbs that invigorate blood and dissolve stasis to clear the running path of yang qi and restoreits function to unblock yang qi and most commonly used in clinical practice; yang stagnation is likely to turn into re and heat, and tangible excess pathogen also generates toxic heat. 17Herbs which can clear heat, resolve toxins, and be used to drain heat and unblock qi. After eliminating the tangible excess pathogens like phlegm and stasis, yang qi will move freely around the whole body. It will function to propel, transform qi and warmth,driving the body fluids into their proper path and make it nourish the body. And the vicious circle of yang stagnation - phlegm stasis -worse stagnation will be relieved. It Is Necessary to Warm Yang While Unblocking Yang Qi It is stated in Spiritual Pivot (Ling Shu) that \"Accumulation starts because of coldness. Then it develops into disease. \" This sentence suggests that coldness is an important patho-genic factor in forming an accumulation pattern. Further- more, when there is yang stagnation in the human body, warming herbs shall be used to generate mild re and Chinese Medicine and Natural Products V ol. 3 No. 1/2023 \u00a9 2023. The Author(s).Treating Benign Accumulation Pattern in Young and Middle-Aged Women Zhang et al. e12 produce qi. De ciency and stagnation of yang qi interact as both cause and effect; therefore, warming and unblockingyang shall be performed simultaneously. They complement each other and are inseparable. Yang stagnation, in essence, is not a de ciency in yang qi. Therefore, tonifying medicinal shall not be used, one of the reasons is that strong re consumes qi and the other is that it may enlarge the stagnated re which consumes yin essence, which may cause the syndrome of yin de ciency. However, mildly tonifying can be used, but their dose should not be large. Heart-Nourishing and Mind-Calming Herbs Can Be Added to Unblock Yang Qi Li et al6have proved that benign accumulation in young and middle-aged women has related to the disorder of female hormones. Jing et al11report that the change in female hormones largely affects women 's emotion. Female patients are easy to feel sad or angry before and during menstruation. Emotion is the main factor that forms accumulation syn- drome; therefore, heart-nourishing and mind-calming herbs,combined with comforting words, Flos) are most commonly used. With the improvement in the living standard, the diet of modern people has changed greatly. Many people nowadays prefer oily and salty food, some of which cannot be digestedby the spleen and stomach and leads to accumulated phlegm and food remaining. Therefore, ingredients to fortify the to strengthen the function of transportation andtransformation. Benign accumulation syndrome may be- come cancer. Guided by the principle of preventing the existing disease from developing, toxin-resolving or added. Recognition of the Method of Unblocking Yang Qi by Modern Medicine and Pharmacology Yang stagnation is the basic pathology of benign accumula- tion syndrome in young and middle-aged women. Unblock- ing yang is its key treatment method. In treating breastnodules, thyroid nodules and uterine myoma, Tang 19and Xia20use a single or combination of ingredients which can unblock yang qi, soothe the liver, promote urination, dissolvephlegm, dissipate stasis, warm yang, and clear heat. From databases like CNKI, ChinaInfo, VIP, and PubMed, Zhang et al 21have retrieved totally 567 Chinese herbal compounds which treat hyperplasia of mammary glands, thyroid nodule, and uterine myoma. All these formulas 'ingredients have the functions of heat-clearing, tonifying, phlegm dissolving,cough-alleviating, blood invigorating, and stasis dissolving. All the compounds include warming ingredients to help yangqi circulate. There are also ingredients to drain stagnated heat. All these methods are applied to alleviate clinical symptoms and improve the patients 'living quality. Modern pharmacology also showed that herbs which un- block yang qi, soothe the liver, dissolve phlegm, dissipate stasis, warm yang, dissipate masses, and clear heat can aloneor together improvetheinner environmentof thehumanbody. (Cinnamomi Ramu- lus)-Fuling (Poria) can increase urine volume in mice and has along-lasting diuretic effect, which proves that ve substances powder with Poria (Wu Ling San) is effective in unblocking yang and promoting urination 22;the combination of and Taoren (Persicae Semen) has an anticoagulate effect and is more effective than a single ingre- dient, which shows that the function of unblocking yang qi ofRamulus Cinnamomi promoted the function of dissipating stagnation of Semen Persicae 23; the Macrostemonis Bul-bus) has phlegm and relieving cough, antiatherosclerosis, antiplatelet aggregation, and antitumor, which shows that herbs to unblock yang qi, propel qi, anddissolving phlegm combined can eliminate the pathogenic products like phlegm and stasis 24; warming the function of anitumor and regulating sex hormone25;costunolide (Cos) and dehydrocodeno lactone active ingredient. They can prevent theexisting disease from developing. 26 Conclusion Benign accumulation pattern is becoming a kind of common-ly encountered disease in young and middle-aged women. It is urgent to study its pathogenesis and to discuss its treat- ment method. Yang stagnation is the basic pathogenesis ofthis pattern. Unblocking yang is its basic treatment method, which embodies the theoretical characteristics of syndrome differentiation of TCM. Considering the physical character-istics of the patients in this age, the evolving rule of yang stagnation-phlegm stasis-worse stagnation is precisely ap- plied. It has important practical guiding signi cance for preventing and treating benign accumulation patterns in young and middle-aged women.
