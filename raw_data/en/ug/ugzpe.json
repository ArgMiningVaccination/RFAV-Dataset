Introduction The combination of a fluoroquinolone with rifampin is one of thecornerstonesinthetreatmentof prostheticjointinfections(PJI)caused by staphylococci. In 1998, Zimmerli et al. demonstrated rate of 100% using ciprofloxacin plus rifampin in combi-nation with debridement and retention of the implant (DAIR) inpatients with acute infection [1]. The success rate was only 67% in patients who were treated with ciprofloxacin monotherapy. In ad-dition,severalstudieshaveshownthatrifampincombinationswithagents other than fluoroquinolones are less successful [2,3]. These important ndings have led to an international recommendationto use ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin in combination with rifampinas a rst-line oral therapy in staphylococci infections [4]. Moxifloxacin is a newer fluoroquinolone with a high oral bioavailability and bone penetration [5-7]. Compared with levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin exhibits (MSSA). In addi- tion, moxifloxacin has a lower potential than other quinolones to* Corresponding author. University and International Society of Chemotherapy.

Therefore, moxifloxacin is an attractive antimicrobial agent in the treatmentof PJI. However, some studies on tuberculosis have shown thatrifampin lowers moxifloxacin serum levels by 30%, whereaslevofloxacin and associated with no lowering oflevofloxacinserumlevelsinpatientswithpyogenicspondylodiscitis [10-12].Inaddition,moxifloxacinaloneshowshighintra-variability in serum levels and bone concentrations [11-13]. The clinical rel- evance of these ndings remains unclear.

Therefore, we retrospectively compared two cohorts of pa- tients with early acute PJI caused by MSSA who were treated withrifampincombinedwitheithermoxifloxacinorlevofloxacin.Theob-jective of our study was to compare the clinical outcome of bothcohorts. 2. Patients and methods2.1. Data collection We retrospectively analysed the medical les of patients who were treated with moxifloxacin and rifampin (at the UniversityMedical Centre Groningen [UMCG], The Netherlands) andlevofloxacinandrifampin(attheHospitalClinicof Barcelona,Spain)in the period 2005-2015. The use of these two different antibioticregimensisthestandardrst-lineoralantimicrobialtherapyintherespective University Hospitals. Patients with early acute PJI(i.e. <3monthspost-operativelyandsymptoms <3weeks)of knee or hip, caused by MSSA and treated with DAIR, were included inthe analysis. A PJI was diagnosed according to the diagnostic cri-teriadescribedbytheMusculoskeletalInfectionSociety(MSIS) [15]. Several baseline characteristics were collected, including the pa-rametersthatareprognosticfortreatmentfailureaccordingtotheKLIC score (i.e. Kidney failure, Liver cirrhosis, Index surgery,C-Reactive Protein [CRP], and Cemented prosthesis) [16]. 2.2. Surgical approach Foradebridement,pre-existingincisionsofthearthroplastywere used. of extensive excision of necrotic/infectedtissue,lavageof 6-9Lof saline,exchangeof mobilecomponentsandmechanical cleaning with brushes of the exposed surfaces of thexedcomponents.Whenmobilecomponentswerenotexchangedaccordingtothejudgmentoftheorthopaedicsurgeon(i.e.xedcom-ponents and/or clinical suspicion of supercial wound infection),thiswasrecorded.AttheUMCG,ingeneral,gentamicinbeadchainsand/orgentamicin-impregnatedcollagenspongeswereinsertedatthe time of the DAIR. According to protocol, the gentamicin beadchains were removed 2 weeks after insertion and an extra lavageof the joint was performed. When there were still active signs ofinfections as judged by the orthopaedic surgeon (i.e. persistentwound leakage, persistent rise of inflammatory parameters and/orpurulentwounddischargeduringsurgery),aseconddebridementwas performed during this surgery. 2.3. Antimicrobial treatment After DAIR, patients were treated empirically with broad- spectrum antibiotics and were switched to intravenous cloxacillinorflucloxacillin12g/24hfor7-14daysaftercultureresultsbecameavailable.Theintravenousinductionperiodwasfollowedbyanoral debridement as soon as the antibiogram wasavailable. For all cases, S. aureus was considered susceptible to moxifloxacin or levofloxacin if they were found susceptible tociprofloxacin according to EUCAST breakpoints, as determined bydisk diffusion, Vitek 2 or Etest. Before the start of moxifloxacin, anelectrocardiogram was performed to rule out a prolonged QT-intervalandwasrepeated1weeklaterwhilstontreatment.Incaseof polymicrobialinfections,anextraantimicrobialagentwithspe-cic activity against the other microorganism(s) was added whennecessary. The total duration of antimicrobial therapy was gener-ally approximately 90 days. 2.4. Clinical outcome treatmentwasdenedastheneedforrevisionsurgery during antimicrobial treatment, death-related infection, of infection with S. aureus during follow-up. Follow-up cultures were reviewed to evaluate the development ofrifampin-resistant S. aureus strains. 2.5. Follow-up After discharge, patients were followed at the outpatient clinic at monthly intervals during the period of antimicrobial treatment.After discontinuation of antibiotic treatment, patients were fol-lowedevery3-6monthsduringtherstyearafterDAIRandannuallyafterwards.Theendpointof follow-upwasdenedasthelastvisitof the patient at the outpatient clinic of the orthopaedic or rheu-matology department or as the time point of failure. 2.6. Statistical analysis Within this retrospective cohort study, comparison between groups for continuous variables was analysed using an indepen-dent student t-test or Mann-Whitney U test if the data were notequally distributed. Levene's test was used to test for equalitybetweenvariances.Continuousvariablesweredepictedasmeanandstandarddeviation(SD)ormedianandinterquartilerange(IQR).Forcategorical variables, a Chi-square test was used.

Patient characteristics Atotalof 58patientswereincludedintheanalysis. Table1shows the patient characteristics of the moxifloxacin (n =18) vs. the levofloxacin (n =40) group. Patients were followed with mean du- ration of 50 months (34 SD) in the moxifloxacin group and 67months (50 SD) in the levofloxacin group ( P=0.29). Comorbidity and ASA classication were similar in the two groups. The degreeof inflammation before debridement, as a surrogate parameter forthe severity of infection, was the same for the moxifloxacin andlevofloxacin groups (median CRP The contained (72%) compared with the levofloxacin group39 M. Wouthuyzen-Bakker et al. / International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents 51 (2018) 38-42(28%) ( P=0.001), and polymicrobial respectively; P=0.03). 3.2. Surgical approach Asdescribedinthepatientandmethodsection,thesurgicalap- proach differed between the two groups. Most patients in themoxifloxacingroup(89%)receivedgentamicin-impregnatedbeads(n=12) and/or sponges (n =4). During the surgical procedure to remove the gentamicin beads and perform a lavage, 9 of 12 pa-tients underwent a second debridement based on the pre- and/orintra-operative decision of the orthopaedic The percent-ageof patientswithaseconddebridementinthelevofloxacingroupwas only 2.5% (n =1) In 8 of 9 patients who under- wentanextradebridementinthemoxifloxacingroup, S. aureus was not isolated anymore in the intraoperative cultures. 3.3. Antimicrobial treatment Themediannumberof daysof intravenousantimicrobialtreat- ment was higher in the moxifloxacin group (14 days [14-22 IQR])than in the levofloxacin group days [4-12 IQR]) P<0.001), but the total number of antimicrobial treatment was thesame (90 IQR] versus oral antimicrobial agent during the whole treat-ment period because of a polymicrobial infection that also hadS. aureus activity (linezolid and clindamycin). In the levofloxacin group, this was the case in 2/40 patients (linezolid andcotrimoxazole). 3.4. Prognostic risk score for failure Because of the above-mentioned differences in the groups, we also calculated the KLIC score, which is a prognosticrisk score for treatment failure in early acute PJI, as describedin the patient and method section. The KLIC score was the samein the moxifloxacin and 2.2 [1.2 SD], respectively [ P=0.16]), which corresponds to a chance of treatment failure of 4.5-19.4% [16].Table 1 Patient characteristics.

Wouthuyzen-Bakker et al. / International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents 51 (2018) 38-423.5. Clinical outcome Treatment was successful in 16/19 patients (89%) in the moxifloxacin group vs. in levofloxacingroup( after debridement in both groups (log-rank test, P=0.99). Almost half the patients failed despite receiving antimicrobial therapy. Inthe moxifloxacin group, 1 of 2 patients (50%) failed during treat-ment,whichrequiredanextractionoftheprosthesis,and2of5(40%)patientsfailedduringtreatmentinthelevofloxacingroup( P=1.0); 1 patient died due to an infection, and 1 patient was put on sup-pressivetherapybecauseof clinicalfailure.Inbothcohorts,1patienthad a relapse of infection with S. aureus during follow-up. In 14 of 18 patients in the moxifloxacin group, no follow-up cultures withS. aureus wereavailable.Therewerenorifampin-ormoxifloxacin- resistant S. aureus strains detected in the 4 patients with follow- upculturesduringandaftertreatment(includingthe2patientswithtreatmentfailure).Inthelevofloxacingroup,follow-upcultureswithS. aureus wereavailableforonly2of 40patients,andneitherof them had levofloxacin-resistant strains. Because of the relatively smallnumbersof patientsinthemoxifloxacingroupandthehighsuccessrate (2/18), we considered it not feasible to perform a multiple re-gressionanalysisontheparametersthatweredifferentbetweenthetwo groups. 4. Discussion As previous studies have shown that rifampin signicantly reducesmoxifloxacinserumlevels,theaimof ourstudywastoeval-uate the outcome of patients with early acute PJI caused by MSSAandtreatedwiththemoxifloxacin/rifampincombination.Ourresultsshowasuccessrateof 89%,whichiscomparabletothe87.5%successrateweobservedinpatientstreatedwithlevofloxacinandrifampin.Noneofthefailuresinthemoxifloxacingroupwereduetorifampin-resistant S. aureus strains.Ourdataindicatethatmoxifloxacincould be an effective alternative for levofloxacin in the treatment of PJIwith retention of the implant. To the best of our knowledge this is the rst study to evaluate the ecacy of moxifloxacin combined with rifampin in the treat-ment of PJI. Several studies demonstrate a worrisome interactionofrifampinwithseveralantimicrobials;e.g.rifampinhasbeenshowntodecreasetheserumlevelsof cotrimoxazol,clindamycin,linezolidand fusidic acid [17-21]. Therefore, these combinations should be used with caution in the treatment of implant infections. Torneroet al. demonstrated in Gram-positive PJI that when these so-called 'rifampin-dependent antibiotics' 'rifampin-independent antibiotics' areused [20]. Despite the clear interaction that has also beendemonstrated with moxifloxacin, we observed no negative effect on clinical outcome. The moxifloxacin AUC 0-24hhas been observed 0.12mg/L,theratiois166,whichwouldbeenougheven for bone penetration of around 50% [5-7]. Ourstudyshouldbeviewedinthelightof somelimitations.For example, we included a relatively small number of patients in themoxifloxacin group. In addition, we observed several differencesbetween the moxifloxacin and levofloxacin groups. Although themoxifloxacin group had a very high success rate, the observed dif-ferencesmakedirectcomparisonbetweentheantibioticregimenscomplex.Themostrelevantdifferencebetweenthegroupswasthesurgicalapproach,withtheuseof gentamicinbeadsand/orspongesinthemoxifloxacingroup.Becauseofthis,mostpatientsinthisgroupunderwentasecondlavage,andhalf thepatientsanextradebride-ment. The use of gentamicin-impregnated material remainscontroversial [23]. Extra surgery with additional disruption of the soft tissue might also have a negative effect by disturbing woundhealing and exposing the patient to a new infection. Kuiper et al.analysedwhethertheuseof gentamicinbeadsandspongeswasas-sociated with treatment success in patients with early PJI, but alogisticregressionanalysisdidnotshowanyassociation [24].There- fore, it is not likely that this difference in surgical approach had amajor impact on the treatment outcome. The moxifloxacin grouphad a higher rate of hip PJI and a longer duration of intravenousantimicrobial treatment, but several studies have shown that theaffectedjointandashorterdurationof intravenoustherapyarenotrisk factors for failure [2,22,25] . Indeed, the KLIC score, a prognos- ticriskscorefortreatmentfailureinearlyPJI,wasthesameinbothgroups. In addition, because the number of polymicrobial infec-tions was higher in the moxifloxacin group, and this has beenassociated with a higher failure rate, the treatment success ofmoxifloxacin is unlikely to be overestimated in the studied pa-tients [2,25]. Inconclusion,theexcellentactivityofmoxifloxacinagainststaph- ylococci, its high genetic barrier for resistance and its easy usagein patients with renal insuciency, makes moxifloxacin an attrac-tive agent to use in clinical practice. Our data indicate thatmoxifloxacin and rifampin combination therapy can be used as analternative for levofloxacin and rifampin in the treatment of earlyacutePJIcausedbyMSSA.Asthiswasaretrospectivestudydesign,with observed baseline differences between the cohorts and a rel-atively small sample size, the non-inferiority of moxifloxacin tolevofloxacin should ideally be studied in a randomized controlledtrial to ultimately prove its ecacy.
