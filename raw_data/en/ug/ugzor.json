Mild to moderate symptoms, including feverishness, chills and fatigue, were reported more frequently after the second dose among those who received mixed doses. Adverse reactions were short lived and no other safety concerns were reported, researchers added. \"The results from this study suggest that mixed dose schedules could result in an increase in work absences the day after immunisation, and this is important to consider when planning immunization of healthcare workers,\" [said](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-05-13-preliminary-data-suggests-mixing-covid-19-vaccine-increases-reactogenicity-0) Matthew Snape, MD, lead study investigator and associate professor in pediatrics and vaccinology at the University of Oxford. Study participants were aged 50 and above, which suggests such reactions to mixed doses could be more common among younger age groups, according to researchers. The preliminary findings are part of the U.K.'s larger \"Com-COV\" study, launched earlier this year to evaluate participants' immune response to mixed vaccine doses. The research on mixed doses being associated with more mild and moderate symptoms was an early, secondary finding. Data on whether mixed dosing schedules affects the immune response will likely be reported in the coming months, researchers said. "}
