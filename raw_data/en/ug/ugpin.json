View this on Karina's website here [https://www.karinagrant.co.uk/events](https://www.karinagrant.co.uk/events) For more information about Quantum-Touch - [https://www.karinagrant.co.uk/quantum-touch/what-is-quantum-touch-energy-healing](https://www.karinagrant.co.uk/quantum-touch/what-is-quantum-touch-energy-healing) Quantum-Touch is an energy healing technique that is unique in both its speed and effectiveness, producing the most remarkable results many have ever seen in any healing modality yet. Quantum-Touch is a method of energy healing that uses very specific breathing techniques and body awareness exercises - to create a powerful, yet natural, field of healing energy. When the practitioner holds a high vibrational field of life-force energy around an affected area, this inspires the body's healing process and creates a rapid healing response. There is no physical manipulation in Quantum-Touch. Only the lightest, most gentle touch is used. Quantum-Touch is a method of natural healing that works with the Life Force Energy of the body to promote optimal wellness. Life Force Energy, also known as \"chi\" in Chinese and \"prana\" in Sanskrit, is the flow of energy that sustains all living beings. Quantum-Touch teaches us how to focus, amplify, and direct this energy, for a wide range of benefits with surprising and often extraordinary results. Quantum-Touch is a highly effective method for reducing back pain, realigning structure, balancing organs, glands and systems, reducing muscle aches, healing injuries, healing burns, and so much more.What is Quantum-Touch used for? Your body has the unfathomable energy to heal itself. You do not have to instruct your body how to heal a cut, a bruise or a broken bone; it has the innate ability to do so. However, if your health is poor or your immune system is in some way compromised, then your body does not have the energy needed to heal itself from serious illness or injury. Quantum-Touch simply provides a powerful field of natural healing energy that your body entrains to and can draw upon to accelerate its healing. In this short video Clare talks about some of the highlights she has witnessed with Quantum-Touch. This includes blood pressure reduce, better breath output when doing \"air flow tests\" for the lungs and it is a part of her life as a nurse - especially through covid. Clare has been using the Quantum-Touch breath and techniques both personally and professionally.What Will You Learn in a Quantum Touch Level 1 workshop? and much much more..!! You will learn: This is the core technique that is used in Quantum-Touch and is easily learned by people of all ages and ability. Children and great - grand parents have taken the workshop. All by itself, this is an invaluable skill and is especially useful for treating injuries and any pain caused by inflammation. Actually, the body moves them into correct alignment. You don't have to figure it out any more than you need to understand how you digest your breakfast. This may well be the easiest as well as the most effective way to reduce or eliminate back pain. We have dozens of chiropractors that are now using Quantum-Touch because it is so effective. When those you love are not near and you want to help, don't feel helpless because there is something significant you can do. Distant healing with Quantum-Touch is tremendously effective. This truly ups the power of your sessions tremendously. This is the most powerful technique presented in the basic workshop. This allows individuals to run energy as if they were a whole group of people. It's a great joy to use this work with animals as they usually respond amazingly quickly. Vets and those working with animals frequently attend Quantum-Touch workshops.A note about healing Quantum-Touch does not claim to treat or heal specific conditions. Ultimately if the body can, it will heal itself and Quantum-Touch may accelerate that process.About Karina Karina was born in 1977 and attended her first Louise Hay and breath work seminar at age 12. When her Father was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 2005, she searched for ways to help his symptoms and discovered Quantum-Touch (QT). After seeing the immediate effect the treatment had on his posture, which straightened completely in just one session, she decided to explore this incredible technique fully in order to be able to help him herself. The profound results from their Quantum-Touch sessions led her on a fast track journey into exploring the most powerful energy healing methods available in the world, in order to help others. Her passion for pro active natural healthcare that stimulates the body's innate capacity to return to health has since inspired her to teach this powerful form of energy healing to as many people as possible, through workshops and private sessions. In 2007 Karina was invited to become England's advanced instructor for Quantum-Touch, and has instructed many large workshops internationally. As a natural progression in her fulfilling journey a practitioner and instructor, Karina started the HI CHI Integrated Health Institute in 2015. The HI CHI Integrated Health Institute offers powerful resources to facilitate balance and wellness.
