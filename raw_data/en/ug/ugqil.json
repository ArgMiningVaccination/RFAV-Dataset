Are there truly any benefits to lemon water? There's a great deal of anecdotal evidence surrounding the benefits of drinking lemon water, but not much scientific evidence for the practice. However, by including studies into the health benefits from lemons, we can deduce more from how incorporating them in our everyday diet can improve our health. Let's take a look first at the nutritional properties of lemon juice. According to the website [NutritionData](https://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/fruits-and-fruit-juices/1938/2), the juice from one lemon contains: - Energy: 11.7 calories (kcal) - Vitamin C: (mg) - Folate: 6.1 micrograms (mcg) - Calcium: 3.3 mg - Magnesium mg - Phosphorus: 2.8 mg - Potassium: 58.3mg [NutritionData](https://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/fruits-and-fruit-juices/1938/2) says that lemon juice is a good source of folate and potassium and a very good source of vitamin C. It's also very low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and salt. Here's how the clinical evidence stacks up in favor of lemons and lemon water: A 2017 review published in the peer-reviewed journal, [Nutrients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/), compared the benefits of ingesting vitamin C with topical application of creams and ointments. It found that having more vitamin C in the diet helped the skin to heal faster and reduce the appearance of scars. Moreover, a study the year before in [Food Chemistry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308814615013023?via%3Dihub) found that the vitamin C in 'citrus based juice mixtures' helped to suppress wrinkle formation in hairless mice, by stimulating [collagen](https://www.livescience.com/collagen.html) production. Large doses of vitamin C can also be effective in protecting the body's immune system, protecting it from infection. A study by researchers that was published in [Nutrients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5707683/pdf/nutrients-09-01211.pdf) in 2017 found that 200mg of vitamin C a day could treat respiratory infections, such as the common cold and even pneumonia. According to [NutritionData](https://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/fruits-and-fruit-juices/1937/2), lemons contain around 139% of the recommended daily intake of vitamin C, so they're a great place to start when it comes to upping your daily intake. The calcium and potassium found in lemons may also help to reduce blood pressure. A [Journal of Nutrition and Metabolism](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jnme/2014/912684/) found that women who ingested lemons daily and combined this with exercise had lower blood pressure than those who didn't, although it's not clear from the study whether the participants drank lemon juice or ate the flesh. Finally, there's less clinical evidence to support the use of lemon as an aid to digestion and weight loss, but an abundance of anecdotal support. If you take lemon water instead of fruit juices or sodas, you'll be slashing your calorie intake, which will help you lose weight. [Staying hydrated](https://www.livescience.com/35952-hydration-health-tips.html) can also help to boost weight loss, by reducing water retention, so it's a win-win! Lemon water: Considerations It's worth noting that, despite the potential benefits, lemon water could increase the risk of enamel erosion, because of the acidity of the water. When enamel is worn away, it exposes the underlying dentin and may cause you to experience sensitivity. However, there are some simple ways to drink your lemon water without damaging your tooth enamel: - Brush your teeth before drinking and rinse your mouth with plain water afterwards. - Use juice from a fresh lemon, not concentrated, commercial juice. - Drink it through a straw to minimize contact with your teeth. - Wait an hour before you brush your teeth. Acids soften tooth enamel, and brushing this could damage it further. How can I make lemon water at home? This part is super easy! Simply slice up a lemon and put as many slices into a cup of just-boiled water as you wish. Or you can squeeze the lemon or use a juicer to extract the juice first and then add it to your beverage. Make sure you remove any pips first and allow the water to cool a little before drinking. You can also boil the lemon in the water, by quartering or slicing the fruit, and adding it to a pot of boiling water. Allow to simmer or boil for 3 minutes, before cooling and drinking. If you find lemon water too bitter, you can add a little honey to sweeten.
