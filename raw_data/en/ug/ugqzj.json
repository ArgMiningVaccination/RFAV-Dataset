{"title": "Improvement of Chronic Neck Pain After Posterior Atlantoaxial Surgical Fusion via Multimodal Chiropractic Care: A Case Report", "author": "Eric Chun-Pu Chu; Robert J Trager; Cliff Tao", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "There is a lack of research regarding the effectiveness and safety of manual therapies, including spinal manipulative therapy (SMT), for patients with previous cervical spine surgery. A 66-year-old, otherwise healthy, woman who underwent C1/2 posterior surgical fusion for rotatory instability during adolescence presented to a chiropractor with a six-month history of progressive worsening of chronic neck pain and headaches despite acetaminophen, tramadol, and physical therapy. Upon examination, the chiropractor noted postural changes, limited cervical range of motion, and muscle hypertonicity. Computed tomography revealed a successful C1/2 fusion, and degenerative findings at C0/1, C2/3, C3/4, and C5/6, without cord compression. As the patient had no neurologic deficits or myelopathy and tolerated spinal mobilization well, the chiropractor applied cervical SMT, along with soft tissue manipulation, ultrasound therapy, mechanical traction, and thoracic SMT. The patient's pain was reduced to a mild level and the range of motion improved over three weeks of treatment. Benefits were maintained over a three-month follow-up as treatments were spaced apart. Despite the apparent success in the current case, evidence for manual therapies and SMT in patients with cervical spine surgery remains limited, and these therapies should be used with caution on an individual patient basis. Further research is needed to examine the safety of manual therapies and SMT in patients following cervical spine surgery and determine predictors of treatment response.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2023-02-04", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
