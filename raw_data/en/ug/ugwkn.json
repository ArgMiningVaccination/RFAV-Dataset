Specifically, the Department received questions on what should be included in the medical exemption documentation to ensure that it meets the requirements for the exemptions. In response, the Department is issuing this guidance document to assist healthcare providers, schools, preschools, child care facilities, and local health departments with medical exemptions for mandatory vaccines. By way of background, N.J.A.C. 8:57 - 4.2 states that a \"principal, director or other person in charge of a school, preschool, or child care facility shall not knowingly admit or retain any child whose parents or guardian has not submitted acceptable evidence of the child's immunization, \" according to the schedules specified in the rules. However, an unvaccinated child may attend a school, preschool, or child care facility if the required vaccination is medically contraindicated for the child. See N.J.A.C. 8:57-4.3. In order to obtain a medical exemption, N.J.A.C. 8:57-4.3 requires a written statement to be submitted to the school, preschool, or child care center by a physician licensed to practice medicine or osteopathy, or an advanced practice nurse who is licensed in any jurisdiction in the United States indicating that the immunization is medically contraindicated for the child for a specific period of time, and the reason(s) for the medical contraindication, based upon valid reasons as enumerated by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the United States Public Health Service or the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines. To assist treating healthcare providers with submitting adequate and sufficient medical exemption requests that meet the requirements of N.J.A.C. 8:57-4.3, and to guide school, preschools, child care facilities, and local health departments with determining whether an exemption is consistent with the rule requirements, the Department drafted the attached Request for Medical Exemption from Mandatory Immunization form that may be used for medical exemptions. Table 1. of the form lists the vaccines that are mandated for children to attend schools, preschools, and child care facilities and current ACIP contraindications and precautions for each vaccine. This form allows the healthcare provider to indicate the vaccine for which the exemption is sought as well as the ACIP contraindication or precaution that is recognized for that specific vaccine and applies to the child. In the event the form does not list the specific contraindication or precaution that exempts the child from a particular vaccine, the form also includes a space marked as \"Other\" where the healthcare provider may explain, in detail, the contraindication or precaution for the child's receipt of vaccine. The use of \"Other\" as a contraindication or precaution should be extremely rare, and the contraindication/precaution must be consistent with ACIP guidelines and established national standards for vaccination practices to be accepted. Table 2. of the form lists conditions that are incorrectly perceived as contraindications or precautions for vaccines, which provides further guidance to the healthcare provider in determining whether the exemption is valid and medically accepted. These guidelines are accessible on the CDC and AAP website at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/contraindications.html or https://redbook.solutions.aap.org/redbook.aspx.GUIDANCE FOR REQUESTING A MEDICAL EXEMPTION FROM MANDATORY IMMUNIZATIONVaccine Preventable Disease Program IMM-53JULY 19Page 1 of 7 The form will also assist schools, preschools, child care facilities, and local health departments in determining the validity of the exemption and whether it should be accepted or rejected. Specifically, the school, preschool, child care facility, and local health department may accept a medical exemption in which a healthcare provider indicates a contraindication or precaution listed in Table 1. However, a school, preschool, child care facility, and local health department should not accept a medical exemption in which a healthcare provider indicates a condition listed in Table 2. It should be noted that healthcare providers who submit medical exemptions for mandatory vaccinations must ensure that the information submitted is accurate and verifiable. Supporting medical documentation may be requested by the school, preschool, or child care facility and/or by local or state public health authorities. Healthcare providers who misrepresent medical information may be referred to the New Jersey State Board of Medical Examiners and/or appropriate licensing/regulatory agency. If a healthcare provider, school, preschool, or child care facility has questions about medical exemptions, it should direct the questions to the local health department with jurisdiction over the municipality in which the school is located. To locate the local health department, please visit the New Jersey Department of Health website at https://www.nj.gov/health/lh/community/index.shtml#1. Local health departments with questions can directly contact the Vaccine Preventable Disease Program at 609-826-4861. Please also note that the use of the Form is not a mandate or requirement, but rather a tool that may be used by healthcare providers, schools, preschools, child care facilities, and local health departments in determining the validity of a medical exemption from a mandatory immunization. The form will also assist schools, preschools, child care facilities, and local health departments in determining the validity of the exemption and whether it should be accepted or rejected. Specifically, the school, preschool, child care facility, and local health department may accept a medical exemption in which a healthcare provider indicates a c ontraindication or precaution listed in Table 1.
