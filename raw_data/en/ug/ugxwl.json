COC can be surface treated like other olefins, using standard technologies such as corona, plasma or flame. When treated, TOPAS COC tends to achieve and maintain higher treatment levels than similar resins, including polyolefins like PE and PP. In healthcare, other polymers may have a higher energy surface that can compromise drug storage. Lower surface energy can promote liquid transfer efficiency to maximize drug utility, leaving less active ingredient remaining in the container.
