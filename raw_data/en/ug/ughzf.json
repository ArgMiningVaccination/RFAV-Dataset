It's the time of the year many of us look forward to. While this can be a period of relaxation, being carefree, and celebrating with your loved ones, for other people, it can be quite the opposite, and stress levels may be at their highest. Now is the time to start building \u2014 and using \u2014 your aromatic support toolkit. According to data from an American Psychological Association survey (Greenberg & Berktold, 2006), during the holidays, over 50% of respondents experienced symptoms such as: This concerning trend is mainly observed in adult women, who are most affected by stress and the associated decline in mood and mental well-being. An increase in stress levels during the holidays was observed by as many as 44% of surveyed women. Among men, this figure was 31% \u2014 lower, but still too high. Many factors influence holiday stress, from operating under time pressure and strained finances to the unique pressures of exchanging gifts with others. While stress itself is a vast topic, it's important to focus on how it affects us. Living under constant stress takes a huge toll on our bodies, and the effects reach far beyond the obvious impact on our well-being and psychological comfort. Being overwhelmed by the number of stressors around you has a tremendous impact on the proper functioning of our entire organism...especially when it comes to our immune system. You might wonder \u2014 how is that possible? Scientists in the 1970s and 1980s observed that our psyche and mental health have a direct impact on our overall physical health. Over time, a new branch of science began to emerge, which we now call psychoneuroimmunology (PNI). PNI combines psychological and medical sciences and looks for connections between the functioning of the nervous system and the immune system. Research in the field of PNI focuses mainly on the impact of the stress hormone cortisol and signaling proteins called cytokines on the cells of the immune system, as well as on analysis of gene expression activated in the cells of the immune system when it is under stress. The nervous system, specifically the autonomic nervous system, innervates the organs of the immune system (such as the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes). Nerve endings are even found in our marrow. The organs and cells of the immune system have receptors for neurotransmitters that are released by nerve endings throughout the body. As you may know, our autonomic nervous system responds to our stress levels. If you've heard the term \"fight or flight response,\" that's part of your autonomic nervous system \u2014 specifically, the sympathetic nervous system \u2014 kicking into gear when you're stressed. In other words \u2014 the amount of stress and emotions we experience really does affect our physical health. \"Individuals exposed to chronic stressors can exhibit immune dysregulation that may be persistent and severe.\" (Morey et al., 2015) Conversely, certain psychological or physiological disorders can influence the development of psychosomatic disease. These include, for example, stomach ulcers, migraines, hypertension, eating disorders, or insomnia. These are also a focus of psychoneuroimmunology. To broaden your perspective, here are a few quick examples courtesy of Bryniarski (2017): Then, how you feel begins to actually determine how you feel. Stress and emotions begin to overwhelm you physically, and a disturbed immune system does not help at all. Your body stops dealing with the encountered viruses, bacteria and fungi. This is one of the best and safest (at Essence of Thyme, these two words are synonyms!) ways to use your essential oils for supporting your overall health during the holiday season. We recommend essential oils that support general relaxation, a calm mood, and healthy cortisol levels. Below you will find 3 essential oils that you may find useful during the holiday season. You can combine aromatherapy with other relaxation methods (e.g., breathing techniques, meditation, or yoga) to maximize their therapeutic potential. Inhalation is a particularly effective method if you are using aromatherapy for emotional benefits. Aromas delivered directly to the smell receptors in our brain have a powerful effect on our behaviour. And that is exactly what we need in this case. You can use your essential oils in a diffuser, add 10-20 drops of your essential oil blend to an inhaler for a healthy adult, or put 1-4 drops on a tissue and inhale gently for a few minutes. While each essential oil can be used on its own, we recommend blending them together to benefit from the combination of therapeutic constituents and for a more complex aroma. There are many studies about lavender oil, but for the sake of this post, we want to talk about 3 of them. A single-blind clinical trial by Hosseini et al. (2016) aimed to determine the effect of lavender essential oil on anxiety and blood cortisol levels in candidates for open heart surgery. The study and control groups inhaled 2 drops of lavender and distilled water for 20 minutes respectively, then blood samples were taken. Results showed a significant reduction in mean anxiety score in the study group compared to the control group. There was also a higher difference in cortisol levels in the study group compared to the control group. Other tests showed that the 10.8% variance in anxiety score and 69.6% decrease in blood cortisol resulted from the inhalation of lavender. In the other study, pregnant women were massaged with 2% lavender oil (please note that at Essence of Thyme, we recommend 1% dilution for pregnant women). After 20 weeks, their saliva had a lot more IgA antibodies and decreased cortisol levels (Chen et al., 2017). A similar study examined the effect of a massage mixture of lavender, marjoram, and cypress oils, which was found to lead to an increase in the number of lymphocytes in the blood (Kuriyama et al., 2005). Based on these results, researchers concluded that the calming effect of lavender oil may have a positive effect on the functioning of the immune system. During winter, sweet orange not only reminds us of the sun and summertime, but it also suits the festive mood of December. Let's examine some studies concerning sweet orange oil. In a study by Jafarzadeh et al. (2013), 30 children aged 6-9 years participated in a type of study called a crossover intervention study. Every child underwent 2 dental treatment appointments with orange aroma in one session (intervention) and without any aroma (control) in the other. Each child's anxiety level was measured using salivary cortisol and pulse rate before and after treatment in each visit. These results suggest that the use of aromatherapy with sweet orange essential oil could reduce salivary cortisol and pulse rate due to a child's anxiety state. In another interesting study by Komori et al. (1995), citrus oils (including orange oil) were given to 12 people diagnosed with depression. Results indicated that the doses of these individuals' antidepressants could be markedly reduced. The use of citrus oils normalized neuroendocrine hormone levels and immune function and was concluded to be more effective than antidepressants in this regard as measured during the course of the study. Research by Goes et al. (2012) also suggests that sweet orange essential oil shows anxiolytic activity, and could be used by aromatherapists to support a calmer mood. Clary sage is another great essential oil to use when dealing with stress and improving your mood. It is often recommended for women who are entering the menopausal transition and the unpleasant symptoms that can go with it. In a study by Lee et al. (2014), the researchers examined 22 women (some of whom were diagnosed with depression) in their 50s, and their cortisol levels, neurotransmitter concentrations, and thyroid stimulating hormone. The results showed that after inhalation of clary sage oil, cortisol levels were significantly decreased. Another conclusion is that clary sage oil might have an antidepressant-like effect and can elevate one's mood. Essential oils are a great tool for many things, and you can safely use them to elevate your mood during stressful situations. Taking care of your immune system should be a priority all year round. It is about very simple things, which are often easy to forget, such as a balanced diet, adequate sleep, proper hydration, physical activity, and reducing the stress that we encounter every day. Stress can often make us feel isolated, and it's very difficult to feel alone, especially during the holiday season. If you are dealing with a personal crisis or feel overwhelmed, please don't hesitate to seek support, including taking advantage of support hotlines available to us all over the world.

Please also use caution and follow safety guidelines when blending for children, people who are pregnant, or people with health concerns.
