Is East Asian Medicine Effective? Although the practice of Chinese Medicine is relatively new to the West, it has been used in Asia for more than 4000 years to treat a vast number of conditions. Acupuncture is the oldest continuously practiced medical system in the world and is used by one-third of the world's population as a primary health-care system. Both the World Health Organization and the National Institute of Health have evaluated scientific research and clinical trials of acupuncture and found it to be effective for a wide range of conditions. How Does Acupuncture Work? Acupuncture is an ancient medicine system of balancing, regulating and strengthening the life force of the human body; called Qi (pronounced chee). Acupuncturists recognize particular pathways called \"channels or meridians\" through which Qi circulates throughout the body. The channels connect all of the internal organs with the rest of the body and provide a constant flow of energy to every cell. The imbalances or blockages in the flow of qi will result in illness, disease and pain. The gentle insertion of hair-thin sterile needles at specific points along the body's channels of qi energy helps restore harmony at the deepest level for the body, mind and spirit. Modern research suggests that acupuncture works by stimulating an auto-immune reaction. Endorphins and other physiological agents in the blood react at the sight and throughout the body. There is often a \"flare\" or pink around the needle indicating increased circulation. Our ancestors used the word Qi to describe many physiological effects that we can describe scientifically today. What Is Fascia? Fascia is connective tissue organized as an interconnected 3D network. It wraps around every cell, tissue and organ. Think of it like a web that supports the bones, muscles, etc. Without it the body would fall apart. It holds the bones in place as opposed to the bones holding the muscles and fascia in place. As much as we would love to delve into the scientific properties we have only so much to work with, so the following is more theoretical with some clinical pearls. So take this with a grain of salt as you should with all information out there. We simply do not know enough. Our bodies maintain form through constant tensional forces from lines & layers of fascia from superficial, to deep to innermost. This connective tissue is also one of the primary water storage units found within the body. "}
