Journal articles Those examples are references to articles in scholarly journals and how they are supposed to appear in your bibliography. Not all journals organize their published articles in volumes and issues, so these fields are optional. Some electronic journals do not provide a page range, but instead list an article identifier. In a case like this it's safe to use the article identifier instead of the page range. Books and book chapters Here are examples of references for authored and edited books as well as book chapters. Web sites Sometimes references to web sites should appear directly in the text rather than in the bibliography. Refer to the Instructions to authors for Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine. Reports This example shows the general structure used for government reports, technical reports, and scientific reports. If you can't locate the report number then it might be better to cite the report as a book. For reports it is usually not individual people that are credited as authors, but a governmental department or agency like \"U. S. Food and Drug Administration\" or \"National Cancer Institute\". Theses and dissertations Theses including Ph.D. dissertations, Master's theses or Bachelor theses follow the basic format outlined below. News paper articles Unlike scholarly journals, news papers do not usually have a volume and issue number. Instead, the full date and page number is required for a correct reference. In-text citations References should be cited in the text by sequential numbers in square brackets: This sentence cites two references [1,2]. This sentence cites four references [1-4].
