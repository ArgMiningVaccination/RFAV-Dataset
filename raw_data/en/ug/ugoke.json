{"title": "Can Integrative and Conventional Medicine Co-Exist?", "author": null, "url": "https://www.chenmed.com/blog/can-integrative-and-conventional-medicine-co-exist", "hostname": "chenmed.com", "description": "American healthcare is irrefutably a world leader in life-saving interventions such as someone experiencing a heart attack, saving someone's life after a vehicle accident, or having a malignant tumor removed. These life-saving measures in the modern healthcare delivery model can be compared to taking your car to a mechanic: you show up with a broken part, and the mechanic repairs or replaces it. But in many ways, we are more like an ecological system than a transactional mechanical system regarding whole-person health. And treating the whole person requires taking a closer look at the ecological system or \"garden\" that comprises the human experience\u2014the physical body, mental and spiritual health, environment and lifestyle, social components, and more. In this regard, American healthcare delivery leaves much to be desired. The flip side of this coin, however, is that treating the person holistically is often likened to pseudo-science or \"woo woo\" practices not backed by as much science or anecdotal evidence as other mainstream medical interventions\u2014treating high blood pressure with mindfulness practices like yoga and meditation versus antihypertensives, for example. Integrating whole-person or holistic treatments within the allopathic or western medical model has proven to be uniquely challenging. A growing number of patients seeking alternative care parallels the growing cynicism among doctors. But also growing is a body of evidence suggesting alternative healthcare measures like acupuncture can be just as successful and with fewer side effects than conventional medical interventions. But questions remain: Is alternative healthcare evidence-based? And what challenges persist when it comes to providing patient-requested integrative healthcare in the current fee-for-service model? Is Integrative Medicine Science-Backed? Based on treating a person as a whole, integrative medicine is based on treating the whole person. Also called complementary or alternative medicine, Integrative medicine combines lifestyle-based healing modalities and conventional medicine to improve patients' health. Because integrative medicine combines the most well-researched conventional medicine with the most well-researched, evidence-based complementary therapies to achieve the appropriate care for each person, patients tend to experience better and more lasting health outcomes. Many integrative therapies are evidence-based, such as: Acupuncture for pain management Aromatherapy Yoga Dietary and herbal supplements Massage therapy Music therapy Meditation and mindfulness techniques Massage therapy is linked to relief from depression, anxiety, and even pain associated with fibromyalgia. Further, it has shown promise for improving digestive disorders, improving symptoms of osteoarthritis, and cancer-related symptoms. Dementia, Memory Loss, and Higher Life Expectancy Even promoting more frequent social interactions can be considered an integrative approach to medical care when you consider that having close relationships, according to one groundbreaking Harvard study, is the single most important determinant for a long life, even more than diet, exercise, or getting quality rest. Dr. Wayne Jonas from Samueli Integrative Health Programs urges that some of these integrative practices are more or less common-sense measures that simply make us human. \"If you were embedded in a loving, social environment in a social community, those were the people that did well for a long, long time,\" Dr. Jonas shares. Relating the study findings to his own practice, he says, \"The first question I should ask is, \"How are your social relationships? How is your social support?\" But how often is that the first question we ask our patients when they walk in and say they've been having a problem?\" He continues, \"We're seeing that even with memory loss and dementia\u2014we've heard Dr. Teal present about how he's been able to reverse memory loss by having patients create and maintain social relationships and interactions. Isn't this what makes us human? Have we really gone that far away?\" In many ways, approaching healthcare holistically is just going back to the basics\u2014leveraging the healing modalities that worked centuries before modern medicine revolutionized healthcare delivery. But persisting challenges in the fee-for-service model make the integration between the two uniquely challenging. \"The FDA, the NIH, and others have said that for chronic pain, we need to use nonpharmacological approaches. But I wasn't trained in how to do that. I was trained to write a prescription. I wasn't trained in how to deliver and support mind-body practices, acupuncture, or the nutritional components that alter the inflammatory setpoint and contribute to the improvement of chronic pain. Now we have to tell patients, 'Oh, we can't pay for that. That's not covered. I can't make that available to my patients because it's not set up to be delivered or accessed through our current payment system,\" Jonas laments. As the healthcare landscape continues to innovate and evolve, value-based care will continue to prioritize the quality of care and the patient-doctor relationship. And as the obsolete one-size-fits-all healthcare approach continues to make its way out of the revolving door of family medicine, ChenMed will continue to encourage physicians to treat the whole person with evidence-based therapies proven to drive positive health outcomes.
