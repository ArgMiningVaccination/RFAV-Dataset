A content analysis of anti-vaccine websites to inform the development of vaccine promotion strategies Objective: We sought to understand the tactics anti-vaccine advocates use to persuade parents against vaccination. Methods: We conducted a content analysis of 480 anti-vaccine websites. Four coders coded 480 websites for: content of the vaccine misinformation presented, source of the vaccine misinformation and the types of persuasive tactics used. We also coded for behaviors and values co-promoted by the websites that could help vaccine promotion efforts develop better targeted materials. Results: Anti-vaccine websites contained a considerable amount of misinformation; primarily that vaccines were dangerous (65.6%), cause autism (62.2%) and \"brain injury\" (41.1%). Websites used both scientific evidence (64.7%) and anecdotes (30.0%) to support these claims. Values such as choice (41.0%), freedom (20.5%) and individuality (17.4%) were used. Commonly co-promoted behaviors included the use of alternative medicine (18.8%) and homeopathy (10.2%), and eating a healthy (18.5%) or organic (5.2%) diet. Cleanisng one's body of also co-promoted (6.8%). Conclusions: Anti-vaccine messages effective tactics to persuade parents against vaccination, including using both credible (scientific) and relatable (parents' anecdotes) sources, and appealing to parents' values and lifestyles. Clinicians and practitioners can leverage these tactics to promote vaccinations.
