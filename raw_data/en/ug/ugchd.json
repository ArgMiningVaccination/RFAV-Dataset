April 2011. Available at: www. ahrq.gov/clinic/tp/probiotictp.htm . ii Preface The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), through its Evidence- Based Practice Centers (EPCs), sponsors the development of evidence reports and technology assessments to assist public - and private-sector organizations in their efforts to improve the quality of health care in the United States . This review was jointly sponsored by the National Institute s of Health (NIH) Office of Dietary Supplement s (ODS) , the NIH National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN). The reports and assessments provide organizations with comprehensive, science-based information on common, costly medical conditions and new health care technologies. The EPCs systematically review the relevant scientific literature on topics assigned to them by AHRQ and conduct additional analyses when appropriate prior to developing their reports and assessments. To bring the broadest range of experts into the development of evidence reports and health technology assessments, AHRQ encourages the EPCs to form partnerships and enter into collaborations with other medical and research organizations. The EPCs work with these partner organizations to ensure that the evidence reports and technology assessments they produce will become building blocks for health care quality improvement projects throughout the Nation. The reports under go peer review prior to their release. AHRQ expects that the EPC evidence reports and technology assessments will inform individual health plans, providers, and purchasers as well as the health care system as a whole by providing important information to help improve health care quality. We welcome co mments on this evidence report.

To catalog what is known about the safety of interventions containing Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus , and/or Bacillus strains used as probiotic agents in research to reduce the risk of, prevent, or treat disease. Data Sources . We searched 12 electronic databases , references of included studies , and pertinent reviews for studies addressing the safety of probiotics from database inception to August 2010 without language restriction. Review Methods . We identified intervention studies on probiotics that reported the presence or absence of adverse health outcomes in human participants, without restriction by study design, participant type, or clinical field. We investigated the quantity, quality, and nature of adverse events. Results . The search identified 11,977 publicat ions, of which 622 studies were included in the review. In 235 studies, o nly nonspecific safety statements were made (\"well tolerated\") ; the remaining 387 studies reported the presence or absence of specific adverse events . Interventions and adverse events were poorly documented. A number of case studies described fungemia and some bacteremia potentially associated with administered probiotic organisms. C ontrolled trials did not monitor routinely for such infections and primarily reported on gastroi ntestinal adverse events. Based on reported adverse events , randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) showed no statistically significantly increased relative risk (RR) of the overall number of experienced adverse events (RR 1.00; 95% confidence interval [ CI]: 0.93, 1.07, p=0.999); gastrointestinal; infections; or other adverse events (RR 1.06; 95% CI: 0.97, 1.16; p=0.201), associated with short- term probiotic use compared to control group participants; long- term effects are larg ely unknown. E xisting studies primarily examined Lactobacillus alone or in combination with other genera, often Bifidobacterium . Few studies directly compared the safety among different intervention or participant characteristics. Indirect comparisons indi cated that effects of delivery vehicles (e.g., yogurt , dairy) should be investigated further. Case studies suggest ed that participants with compromised health are most likely to experience adverse events associated with probiotics . However , RCTs in medium- risk and critically ill participants did not report a statistically significant ly increased risk of adverse events compared to control group participants. Conclusions . There is a lack of assessment and systematic reporting of adverse events in probiotic intervention studies, and interventions are poorly documented. The available evidence in RCTs does not indicate an increased risk ; however, r are adverse events are difficult to assess , and despite the substantial number of publications, the current literatu re is not well equipped to answer question s on the safety of probiotic interventions with confidence. vi Contents Executive Summary ...................................................................................................................ES -1 Introduction ......................................................................................................................................1 Background ..........................................................................................................................1 Project Purpose ....................................................................................................................3 Scope ....................................................................................................................................4 Analytic Framework ............................................................................................................6 Methods ............................................................................................................................................8 Electronic Search for Literature Review ..............................................................................8 Inclusion Screening ..............................................................................................................9 Data Abstraction and Quality Assessment .........................................................................11 Analysis ..............................................................................................................................13 Rating the Strength of the Evidence ..................................................................................15 Resul ts............................................................................................................................................16 Potentially Relevant Studies Not Addressing Safety .........................................................18 Included Studies With Nonspecific Sa fety Statements ......................................................18 Included Studies Addressing Specific Harms ....................................................................20 Discussion ....................................................................................................................................102 Results Summary .............................................................................................................102 Scope and Limitations ......................................................................................................103 Key Questions ..................................................................................................................107 Future Research ...........................................................................................................................115 Conclusions ..................................................................................................................................117 References ....................................................................................................................................118 Included Studies ...........................................................................................................................138 Acronyms and Abbreviations ......................................................................................................182 Figures Figure 1.

T echnical Expert Panel and Peer Reviewers viii Executive Summary Introduction The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) commissioned the Southern California Evid ence- based Practice Center based at RAND to carry out a systematic review on the safety of p robiotics used in research to reduce the risk of, prevent, or treat disease. The evidence report was jointly sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Dietary Supplements , the NIH National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, and the Food and Drug Administration Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. Probiotics (literally, \"for life \") are bacteria or yeasts considered to confer a health benefit on the host organism. The review objective was to catalog what is known about the safety of interventions containing organisms from six different genera used as probiotic agents (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus , and Bacillus ), alone or in combination, used to reduce the risk of, preve nt, or treat disease in research studies. This evidence report has a broad scope and was not restricted to specific interventions, specific patient groups, or specific clinical outcomes. The large number of included studies allow ed unique analyses to explore adverse events reported to date in research on probiotics. Methods We searched 12 electronic databases (DARE, Cochrane Database of S ystematic Reviews, CENTRAL, AMED, MANTIS, TOXLINE, T oxFile , NTIS, and AGRICOLA) and scanned the references of included studies and pertinent reviews for studies addressing the safety of interventions using products containing micro organisms purported to have probiotic properties (henceforth called \"probiotics\") from database inception to August 2010 without language restriction. We systematically identified studies monitoring the presence or absence of participants' adverse health outcomes, without restriction due to study design, participant, or clinical field. Any studies that assessed the effect of microorganisms used as probiotic agents and reported on an adverse health outcome (its presence or absence) were included. Two reviewers independently screened studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed their quality. We differentiated studies th at addressed a specific adverse event from those with nonspecific safety statements. We investigated the quantity of adverse events (number of participants with adverse events per treatment group, number of adverse event incidences per treatment group), the quality of the adverse events (all adverse events, serious adverse events), and the nature of adverse events (e.g., gastrointestinal events, infections). The review aims to answer a large number of questions pertaining to product and participant factors. Studies reporting direct comparisons (e.g., between two different probiotic organisms) were primarily sought ; in addition, indirect evidence was analyzed in stratified analyses and meta- regressions. Results The review demonstrates that there is a large v olume of literature on probiotics. However, the literature provided only limited evidence to address the questions the review set out to answer. ES-1 The literature search identified 11,981 publications, of which 2,189 were ordered as full- text publications after title and abstract screening and 622 studies were included in the review. Of these, 235 studies made only nonspecific safety statements (e.g., \" the intervention was well tolerated \") with out indicatin g what kind of adverse events were monitored. The remaining 387 studies reported the presence or absence of one or more specific adverse events; these studies were abstracted in detail and used to answer the Key Questions . Across all included studies and treatment arms, 24,615 participants used a probiotic product. The review considered reports without study design restrictions and included a large number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs); however, the majority were not designed to address safety. The quality of included studies varied greatly within study design categories. Adverse events were poorly documented, and the parameters that were monitored were often not stated. Interventions were poorly documented, lacking detail, for example, on the specific probiotic strain administered. Very few of the ide ntified studies investigated Saccharomyces or Streptococcus , and even fewer Enterococcus or Bacillus ; the majority of identified studies used Lactobacillus , alone or in combination with other genera, most often Bifidobacterium . To estimate the proportion of existing studies of probiotic organisms found in the literature that are included in this safety review, we noted all RCTs of probiotics that were found in our searches that reported on patient outcomes. Of this pool of potentially relevant RCTs, 58 percent met inclusion criteria for the review (i.e., made a nonspecific safety statement or reported the presence or absence of a specific adverse event) . The remaining RCTs did not address the safety of probiotics as defined in this evidence review. Key Questions Key Question 1 . What is the evidence that the active and lyophilized forms of probiotics (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Bacillus ) as single ingredients or in combination with other probiotics or prebiotics in all delivery vehicles (and formulations) when used to cure, treat, mitigate , or prevent a disease or reduce disease risk are safe in the short term? In the l ong term? Case studies indicated that fungemia, bacteremia, sepsis , and other infections m ay be associated with administered probiotic organisms ; the ability to reliably determine whether administered strains match the clinical isolate is now possible through DNA-based methods. None of the identified case series, controlled clinical trials, or parallel and crossover RCTs reported an infection caused by the administered probiotic organisms. However, studies seldom reported that they monitored for infections of the types identified in case reports. In fact, most did not state what adverse events were monitored and did not systematically address the safety of the probiotic products. Across parallel RCTs there was no indication that the quantity of reported adverse events was increased in short- term probiotic intervention arms compared to control groups, based on the relative risk (RR) of the number of participants with adverse events (RR 0.98; 95% confidence interval [ CI]: 0.93, 1.04, p=0.537; 121 RCTs) a s well as the number of adverse- event incidences reported in each treatment 1.00; 95% CI: 0.93, 1.07, p=0.999; 208 RCTs). The current available evidence does not suggest a widespread risk of adverse events associated with ES-2 probiotics, but future studies that explicitly monitor for the issues of concern are needed to quantify the actual risk of specific adverse events in intervention studies. Key Question 2 . What are characteristics and associations of the reported harms in Question 1? Across all included studies, the most commonly reported adverse events were gastrointestinal in nature. This was followed by reported infections and infestations. The third most common category was the \"other\" category for symptoms that could not be assigned to a specific organ system or type of adverse event. Across identified RCTs, there was no indication that participants using probiotic organisms experienced statistically significantly more gastrointestinal (RR 1.03; 1.01; 95% CI: 0.91 1.12, p=0.923, 131 RCTs) compared to control group participants. Studies rarely reported efforts to monitor adverse events specific to probiotic products. Hence, safety evaluations m ay change with future , more targeted assessment of adverse events in intervention studies. Key Question 3 . What is the evidence that harms of Lactobacillus , Bifidobacterium , Saccharomyces , Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Bacillus differ by product and delivery characteristics? The lack of detail in the description of administered probiotic organisms in most studies hindered evaluations of the safety. Many studies did not specify which probiotic strains were investigated , nor was there indication that intervention preparations were tested for identity of the included organi sms, quantity, viability, or contaminants. Stratified analyses by probiotic genus showed no increased risk of adverse events among the probiotic group compared to a control group in RCTs using interventions reported to contain exclusively Lactobacillus meta the relative risk ratio associated with the genera indicated a statistically significantly higher risk for Streptococcus strains compared with the other genera; however, this indirect comparison is based on a small number of studies that investigated Streptococcus, Enterococcus, or Bacillus interventions. Direct (head- to-head) comparisons of genera, species, strains, or delivery vehicles are largely absent in the literature. There was some indication across studies that safety findings may differ by delivery vehicle. Intervention participants in studies in which yogurt or other dairy products were administered were more likely to experience adverse events compared with control group participants (RR 1.37; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.79; p=0.022) based on the number of adverse event incidences reported across groups in a subgroup analysis. However, studies directly comparing delivery vehicles are missing . We d id not find conclusive evidence in the existing literature that interventions with a mixture of different organisms reported more adverse events than studies using one probiotic strain only or evidence that synbiotics (mixtures of prebiotics and probiotics) differ from probiotics; however, there is a lack of direct comparisons. ES-3 Key Question 4 . How do the , Bifidobacterium , Saccharomyces , Streptococcus, (a) dose; (b) timing; (c) mode of administration; (d) age, gender, ethnic ity, disease or immunologic status; (e) relationship to efficacy? Very few studies overall explored the effect of intervention or participant characteristics on safety. To summarize, in the few studies that reported on the time of onset of gastrointestinal effects, most effects were observed in the first 3 days of treatment. The onset of infections tended to occur 1 week to several weeks after initiation of probiotics use; however, this information is primarily derived from case studies and was not systemat ically reported. In indirect comparisons across studies, we found no evidence that a particular mechanism or route of administration of probiotic organisms was associated with an increased risk of an adverse event in intervention participants relative to control group participants. Stratified analyses and meta- regression s showed no increased risk of adverse events for children (RR 0.96; 95% RCTs ) with adverse events observed in corresponding control groups; however, it has to be noted that only very few studies were identified that reported on elderly participants. There was some indication tha t health status is associated with the experience of an adverse event when using probiotics. Case studies reporting serious adverse events described health-compromised, not generally healthy participants who contracted (most often) a serious infection potentially caused by probiotic organisms. However, subgroup analyses of RCTs in medi um health -compromised participants ( RR 1.03; 95% CI: CI: 0.51, 1.22; p=0.286) did not show a statistically significantly increased risk of experiencing adverse events for intervention participants compared with control group participants with similar patient characteristics. Key Question 5 . How often does harm associated Sacchar omyces , Streptococcus, to hospital admission or lengthened hospitalization? While several case studies reported hospitalization s associated with the consumption of a product including Saccharomyces, Lactobacillus, or Bacillus strains , none of the case series or controlled trials reported that a probiotics intervention led to a hospitalization in the intervention participants. However, the number of hospitalizations due to adverse events was only explicitly reported on in a few of the included studies, and older publications may not have associated a hospitalization with probiotics intake. RCTs report ing on the presence or absence of serious adverse events showed that differences across probiotic and control group participants were not stat istically significant (RR 1.06; 95% CI: 0.97, 1.16; p=0.201, 66 RCTs). However, this result is primarily based on Lactobacillus interventions, and a few studies investigating Saccharomyces and Bifidobacterium ; there was a lack of studies reporting on the presence or absence of serious adverse events for other genera. ES-4 Key Question 6 . How does , Bifidobacterium , Saccharomyces , Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Bacillus use of concomitant antibiotics, confounding diet therapies, corticosteroid use, immune suppressants, or other potential confounders? We did not identify studies that address ed possible interactions or confounders of probiotics interventions. Although the risk of adverse events in general might be higher in individuals taking multiple medications, subgroup analyses of studies in which the intervention participants as well as the control group participants received antibiotics ( RR 1.07; 95% p=0.650) found no statistically significant increased risk of adverse effects among intervention participants. There were too few studies to explore interactions with concomitant diet therapies , and studies in participants using immune suppressants were also largely absent from the existing literature. Future Research Future studies need to characterize the intervention preparations in more detail. As identification methods progress, the reporting should include verification with D NA-based methods to identify the individual strains included in preparation, the ir potency and viability , and any potential confounders. The majority of existing studies report on Lactobacillus , alone or in combination with other genera, most commonly Bifidobacterium strains, and more studies are needed to explore potential adverse events associated with interventions that include the genera Enterococcus and Bacillus , in addition to studies on Streptococcus species selected for their probiotic properties, as well as studies on the use of Saccharomyces in some patient groups. Studies should describe which adverse events were monitored to allow a clearer understanding of the presence and absence of adverse events in probiotics intervention studies. The reporting of adverse events should follow reporting guidelines such as the extension of the CONSORT statement for harms. In addition, there are comprehensive systems for cataloging adverse events , such as the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events system . Monitored harms should include infections with probiotics organisms as well as treatment failures in order to be able to quantify the risk for participants in intervention studies. Critical outcomes, such as all -cause mortality , should be assessed and reported in primary studies, and reviews should consider all studies measuring the outcome regardless of whether the study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention or the occurrence of adverse events. Long -term effects of probiotic interventions are largely unknown, and there is a need to evaluate long -term interventions . In addition, large cohort studies following self- selected use of probiotic organisms are needed to fully understand the efficacy and safety of probiotics among representati ve populations. Currently, few studies address complex questions about probiotic safety, such as interactions of participant or intervention characteristics with the use of probiotic products. The effect of product, intervention, or participant characteristics should be addressed with appropriate multivariate analyses. There is also indication that participants with compromised health should be monitored closely for potential adverse events associated with the use of probiotic products. Studies evaluating e ffects on elderly participants are largely absent from the literature, and the effects of delivery vehicles should be investigated systematically. ES-5 Conclusions There is a lack of assessment and systematic reporting of adverse events in probiotic intervention studies, and interventions are poorly documented. RCTs and case studies diverge in the outcomes they report. The available evidence in RCTs do es not indicate an increased risk ; however, rare adverse events are difficult to assess, and despite the substantial number of publications, the current literature is not well equipped to answer specific questions on the safety of probiotic interventions with confidence. ES-6 Introduction The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) has commissioned the Southern California Evidence- based Practice Center based at RAND to carry out a systematic review on the safety of products containing micro organisms believed to have probiotic properties (henceforth called probiotics or products containing probiotics). This re view was jointly sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Dietary Supplements , the NIH National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, and the Food and Drug Administration Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. Background Probiotics (literally, \"for life \") are micro organisms purported to have a health benefit on the host organism. The definition of what is a probiotic has evolved as the sciences of microbiology, medicine, and the manufacturing industr ies have matured . According to one definition offered by an expert committee convened by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Health Organization, probiotic organisms are live microorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host (FAO/WHO, 2001). This definition explicitly restricts what can be considered a probiotic to live organisms. Other definitions do not emphasize the viability of the microorganisms and woul d include heat -killed preparations (e.g., Salminen, Ouwehand, Benno, & Lee, 1999). Defining probiotics is challenging becaus e of the limits in our understanding of how organisms benefit the human host, the apparent variation in what may constitute a beneficial balance for digestion and other physiological processes, the effects of probiotic organisms on the normal gut environment, and our limited understanding of the gut ecosystem (Schmid, 2006). The genera of bacteria and fungi that have been employed for their probiotic properties are most commonly species of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium ; other bacterial genera, such as Streptococcus, Enterococcus , and Bacillus , and species of the yeast genus Saccharomyces have also been studied. Probiotic properties of genera, species, and st rains may vary according to the indication. Related to probiotic organisms, prebiotics are food products defined as nondigestible food ingredients that benefit the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of one or a limited number of bacteria in the colon and thus improve host health. Synbiotics are preparations in which probiotic organisms and prebiotics are combined, presumably to form a synergistic relationship. The intentional use of microorganisms in the preparation of foods as well as the belief in their health -promoting properties has a long history. Species of the lactic acid bacterium genus Lactobacillus have been used for thousands of years to preserve dairy products by converting milk to yogurt ; likewise, the yeast, Saccharomyce s cerevisiae, has long been used for leavening bread and for f ermenting grains and fru its to make spirits. Various other fungi (molds) have long been known for their use in cheesemaking. Bacillus subtilis , a soil bacterium, has long been used to ferment so y beans to make the Japanese staple food natto. Mixtures of microorganisms have been used to treat infections topically and systemically since ancient times . The use of probiotics to prevent and treat gastrointestinal disorders in particular has been proposed , for example, by Metchnikoff in the 1890s, using Lactobacillus strains to restore normal gastrointestinal microbial balance. The use of Lactobacillus strains to treat urogenital infections is often attributed to Newman , who published a paper in 1915 on this topic (McGroarty, 1993). More recently, the use 1 of the commensal bacterium, Bifidobacterium , has been advocated to promote immune and gastrointestinal function in infants. Probiotic strains of Streptococcus have been used in an attempt to prevent and treat dental disease and gastrointestinal disorders. Probiotic strains of Enterococcus have also been used to treat gastrointestinal infections. Bacillus subtilis has fungicidal properties and, for example, was used as a treatment for gastrointestinal complaints prior to the introduction of sulfur-based antibiotics. Regarding these last two examples, particular concerns have been raised about the safety of the genera Enterococcus and Bacillus , both of which include pathogenic species . Depending on the form and the country in which they are administered or used, probiotic products are classified as any one of several different en tities: dietary supplements, foods, food components, or pharmaceuticals . Each of these categories is subject to entirely different regulations and burdens of proof regarding the demonstration of a health benefit as well as safety, and these regulations and guidelines differ by country (Sanders, 2010; Venugopalan, 2010). Further complicatin g the current picture is that very little is known about the quantities required for the vario us genera, species, and strains to show probiotic properties. The scientific and popular literature includes numerous reviews on the efficacy or effectiveness of probiotic organisms for treating or preventing a variety of conditions. However, despite their popularity, questions remain about the efficacy and effectiveness of probiotics; published reports for specific conditions often provide conflicting results, and the efficacy and effectiveness of probiotics is quite likely to be strain and indication specific. In 2010, the European Food Safety Authority denied the merit of multiple health claims filed on behalf of probiotic products, citing lack of scientific basis (EFSA, 2010). Regardless of the evidence base for the efficacy and effectiveness of products containing probiotics, the widespread availab ility and popularity of products promoted as containing probiotic organisms indicate that their safety warrants further investigation. Probiotic organism s added to foods (i.e., yogurt and some infant formulas ) have been described by some authors as \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS) . Food ingredients considered GRAS are those affirmed or apparently affirmed by their manufacturers as meeting the requirements for the GRAS exemption from the requirement for regulation as a food additive. This term, defined in sections 201(s) and 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, applies to any substance that is intentionally added to food and has been exempted from premarket approval because it is \"generally recognized, among qualified experts, as having been adequately shown to be safe under the conditions of its intended use.\" A uthors often cite the fact that lactic acid bacteria have been used for preservation of food by fermentation for thousands of years as evidence of their safety (World Gastroenterology Organisation, 2008). However, the GRAS designation can be applied only to specified uses of a specific ingredient . Other uses, particularly if they are based on higher exposure or exposure to an ingredient with very different properties, may not be included in the original GRAS designation. Advances in microbiology and molecular biology, along with the adoption of organisms not previously used as probiotics, have contributed to a growing concern about the potential safety of these micro organisms. Specific concerns include the isolation of administered probiotic organisms from infection sites , and the possibility of gene transfer between probiotic organisms and bacteria or fungi dwelling in the digestive tract and antibiotic resistance shown in in vitro studies. A number of cases of infection have been documented that resemble closely the strains given as probiotic agents to the infected individuals or persons in their vicinity. Such concerns suggest that the pathogeni city, infectivity, toxicity, and intrinsic properties of the organisms may 2 require closer study (Ishibashi, 2001). Liong (2008) concluded from a review of the literature that translocation and infection reports associated with use of probiotics deserve further investigation and should become a part of safety assessments so that the negative effects of probiotics do not outweigh the benefi ts. Recent trials and reviews that failed to show the efficacy of probiotics and in some cases report an increased risk of undesirable effects associated with probiotic interventions (Besselink, 2008; Whelan, 2010) also point to a closer look into the safety of probiotics, in particular for patients with compromised health . In order to make informed decisions about the use of probiotic organisms, it would thus appear helpful at this point to assess the evidence for their safety across clinical areas . To date, no comprehensive systematic review has synthesized the available evidence of adverse symptomatic health outcomes in human participants. Project Purpose The review set out to answer a number of research questions posed by the sponsors of the evidence review. Key Questions 1. What is the evidence that the active ( e.g., live or viable) and lyophilized ) sin gle ingredients or in combination with other probiotics or prebiotics in all delivery vehicles (and formulations) when used to cure, treat, mitigate, or prevent a disease or reduce disease risk are safe in the short term? Long term? a. What safety parameters are collected in clinical studies (Phases I -IV)? b. What harms are reported in clinical studies (Phases I -IV)? c. What harms are reported in case reports? d. What safety parameters are collected in population surveillance studies and other observational studies, and do these include only standard clinical safety parameters ( e.g., standard blood chemistry profiles) or also expanded laboratory or clinical testing unique to the use of probiotics? e. What harms are reported in population surveillance studies and other observational studies? f. What harms are reported in human mechanistic studies? g. Do the studies describe an antibiotic therapy designed to treat unintended pathology caused by the administered organism? h. Do the studies describe methods for recovery of the a dministered organism from either the gastrointestinal tract or serum? 2. What are characteristics and associations of the reported harms in Question 1? a. What interactions between probiotics and medications are reported? b. What harms related to acquired antibi otic resistance and/or transferability are reported? c. What is the nature of harms ( e.g., toxicogenic, immunologic, hematologic, deleterious physiologic or metabolic activity, allergic, blood infections, hematocytometric values, liver and renal function enterotoxin, production, proteases, or opportunistic infection, etc.), and do these include only standard harms or also harms that might be uniquely applicable to the use of a probiotic? 3 3. What is the evidence that harms of Lactobacillus , Bifidobacterium , Saccharomyces , Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Bacillus differ by product and delivery characteristics? a. What is the scientific evidence that harms differ by delivery vehicle including excipients or novel delivery vehicles? b. What is the scientific evidence t hat harms differ by genus, species, and strain (including intraspecies strain variations)? c. What is the scientific evidence that harms differ between active and lyophilized forms of probiotics? d. Does harm differ by products containing a single probiotic ve rsus a mixture of probiotics? e. Does harm differ by products containing only probiotics and those containing a mixture of probiotics and prebiotics? 4. How do the Saccharomyces , Streptococcus, on (a) dose (cfu); (b) timing; (c) mode of administration ( e.g., catheter); (d) age (all ages, including infants), gender, ethnicity, disease or immunologic status of the patient; (e) relationship to efficacy? a. Is there a threshold or dose -response relationship between probiotics and harm? Does the duration of intervention relate to harm? b. Is there a relationship between time of onset of harm and time of probiotic administration (e.g., prior to onset of disease under stud y, after disease onset) ? How doe s time of exposure affect harm? Is harm sustained after the intervention or exposure stops? c. Does the route of administration ( e.g., orally, jejunostomy tube, central venous catheter) relate to harm? d. How does harm relate to subpopulations, including different age groups (specifically including neonates and infants under age 24 months), men and women, ethnic/race subgroups, or health status (healthy to high risk) individuals? e. Do randomized controlled studies that report harm show efficacy or no ef ficacy? 5. How often does harm Bifidobacterium , Saccharomyces , Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Bacillus lead to hospital admission or lengthened hospitalization? 6. How does harm associated with Lactobacillus , Bifidobacterium , Saccharomyces , Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Bacillus use of concomitant antibiotics, confounding diet therapies, corticosteroid use, immune suppressants, or other potential confounders? Scope This review on the safety of probiotics is explici tly exploratory in nature. Therefore, a number of clarifications are warranted regarding what th e review set out to achieve and what questions may have to be addressed in future research. First, because little evidence currently suggests the kind s of pote ntial harms that should be investigated in a review on the safety of probiotics, the safety outcomes considered for this review were explicitly not specified a priori ; instead, all reported adverse events were included in the review. Theoretically, a selection of particular kinds of harms could be guided by the nature of the intervention\u2014for example, the exposure to bacteria and yeasts suggests monitoring infections\u2014and as a general research approach, serious adverse events should have priority. But given the lack of any prior synthesis on the specific risks of probiotic organisms for human 4 participants, a broad, unrestricted overview of what has been assessed in the literature and what has been reported appeared most informative. Thus , the review aimed to i dentify the adverse events reported in the literature, without restriction to specific outcomes of interest, as further outlined in the inclusion criteria, with one limitation: The focus was on health outcomes, that is , symptomatic outcomes and/or clinically relevant outcomes, rather than on intermediate outcomes or in vitro results. In this review we explore the quantity, the quality, and the nature of the adverse events as outlined in the methods section. This report is not an efficacy or effectiveness review investigating the usefulness of probiotic organisms for preventing adverse events caused by other treatments such as antibiotic treatment. That is, studies in which efficacy outcomes were identical with adverse events (e.g., prevention of antibiotic -induced diarrhea) were not considered for this review, as further outlined in the inclusion criteria . This restriction required careful review of individual studies, but has also been imposed in other safety reviews (e.g., Pitrou, Boutron, Ahmad & Ravand, 2009), and an overview of the efficacy and effectiveness of probiotic organisms for the prevention of adverse events from other treatments was outside the resources and scope of this project. We considered failed effectiveness outcomes only in those cases where this was explicitly highlighted by the study authors as one of the main results of the study. Throughout this report we use the term \"harm \" and \"adverse event \" interchangeably. We explicitly avoid the term \" adverse effects ,\" as it implies a causal relationship between harm and intervention. In most included studies, there are multiple alternative explanations for the encountered adverse events ; hence we only list the encountered events per treatment group. This review focuses on published literature. A substantial number of peer- reviewed articles reporting on studies of probiotics have been published in scientific journals. Although the pursuit of unpublished data (for example through approaching manufacturers of probiotic products) might be desirable, the approach taken for this exploratory review was to summarize the existing literature in the public domain to develop a clear picture of the readily available body of evidence. The data sources are outlined in the search strategy, and the implications of the search strategy are further addressed in the discussion section. Furthermore, t he review aimed to capture the safety of organisms\u2014Lactobacillus as probiotic agents, rather than the safety of any exposure to any member of these genera of microbiological organisms. The search strategy primarily aimed to identify studies of probiotics , rather than aiming to identify every study th at investigated the effects of the above bacterial or fungal organisms, such as exposure to Streptococcus bacteria strains. Studies were included in the review if they were d escribed as probiotic studies, without further restriction to particular dose; demonstrated health benefits; genera, species , or strains of known quality ; rather , all studies investigating the effect of purposeful intake of probiotic organisms of the genera of interest were considered. However, a reported intervention was part of the inclusion criteria for this review as outlined in detail in the inclusion criteria section. Publications reporting incidences of infections, such as documented cases of Lactobacillus infections, were included in the review only if an intervention prior to the infection was reported, e.g., the probiotic organisms were purposefully consumed or administered . Studies were not restricted to investigator-controlled studies; observational studies of participants using probiotic organisms were also eligible for inclu sion. We also did not restrict the review to products that would be classified as dietary supplements, foods, food ingredients, or pharmaceuticals. 5 Finally, the review summarizes the existing evidence from studies in human participants only; animal studies and in vitro studies were outside the scope of the review. As outlined, t he focus was on adverse events encountered in research studies that used probiotics to reduce the risk, prevent, or treat disease in human participants. In summary, the review aimed to document what is currently known about the safety of probiotics in the existing published research literature on interventions , assuming an inclusive definition of safety and inclusive definition of probiotics . The purpose of the project was to catalog what is known about the safety of probiotics, in particular Lactobacillus , Bifidobacterium , Saccharomyces , Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Bacillus organisms, used in research to reduce the risk of, prevent, or treat disease. The literature review also as sesse d the quality and completeness of the available information and our confidence in interpret ing this information. The overview aimed to provide information relevant to practitioners, researchers, and regulators for assessing the safety of probiotic adm inistration as well as to identify priorities or needs for future research. Analytic Framework Figure 1 shows the universe of studies from which the studies included in this review stem were drawn . Only studies in human participants; studies that used the genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and/or Bacillus as probiotic agents to cure, treat, mitigate , or prevent a disease or reduce the risk of a disease; and studies that addressed health outcomes were sought. Within these studies, we included those studies that addressed the safety of probiotics. All studies that contained vague safety statements as well as those that addressed specific harms, adverse events, adverse effects, side effects, or unintended effects were considered. 6 Figure 1. Included studies Genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and/or Bacillus as probiotic agents Given to cure, treat, mitigate , or prevent a disease or reduce disease risk Human parti cipants Addressing health outcomes Addressing safety All Key Questions were answered with studies within the above outlined universe of studies 7 Methods Electronic Search for Literature Review A pilot literature search undertaken at the outset of the proj ect revealed that whereas safety aspects are not a research priority in the existing probiotics literature, many studies undertake a limited safety analysis as part of assessing efficacy. However , the inclusion of safety results in a publication was rarely indicated in the title or abstract of the publication or referred to in the keywords assigned by the individual electronic database (a finding that is not unique to the research field of probiotics). Although search filters exist for effectiveness studies in some clinical areas, filters to address adverse events tend not to be successful in reliably identifying relevant studies. And because the volume of literature on the efficacy of probiotics, both original research and reviews , was vast, it was necessar y to conduct a careful review of the full text of a large number of publications to identify the relevant body of research results on the safety of probiotics. The chosen search strategy was very inclusive in order not to miss potentially relevant publications. The truncated term \"probiotic\" and the term \"synbiotic\" were used to adequately reflect the scope of this project (see Appendix A) . The term \"prebiotic\" also appeared initially useful and was added to the search strategy. The electronic search was no t restricted to the genera specified in the key questions in order not to miss articles that did not mention the genus in the title, abstract, or keywords of the publication. The genera alone (without reference to their use as probiotics) were not useful s earch terms, as their inclusion added a very large number of irrelevant publications (e.g., all studies on Bacillus infections). Given the large number of probiotic and synbiotic products marketed as dietary supplements, foods, food ingredients, or drugs, the search also did not rely on product names. Many studies used mixtures that were not commercially obtained or available . Thus, an incomplete list of commercial product names might have introduced bias into the selection of studies for review. The identi fied manufacturers of probiotic products are listed in Appendix A. The searches were performed without restriction by publication year or language, taking into consideration that a substantial proportion of research is published in Asian language publications. While uncertainty exists regarding whether the strains investigated in these studies are similar to those common in the U .S. market, these studies need to be assessed. The review also was not restricted with regard to study design; hence, no methodolo gical search filter was applied. The review was restricted to studies in human participants. Rather than searching for studies that were indexed as studies in human participants, th e electronic search was designed to exclude only publications that were ind exed by the individual databases as studies in animals (where possible). Th e intent was to avoid missing studies that were not yet indexed accordingly or were misclassified. Databases The following databases were searched as sources for safety data on prob iotics: DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects) Cochrane library of systematic reviews CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) 8 PubMed (National Library of Medicine, includes MEDLINE) (Figure 2 depicts the PubMed search strategy) Embase (Biomedical and pharmacological bibliographic database) CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) AMED ( Allied and Complementary Medicine ) MANTIS (Manual, Alternative and Natural Therapy Index System) TOXLINE (biochemical, p harmacological, physiological, and toxicological chemicals) ToxFile (biochemical, pharmacological, physiological, and toxicological effects of drugs and other chemicals) NTIS (National Technical Information Service) AGRICOLA (agr icultural journals) Figure 2. PubMed search strategy PubMed - 1966-2010 probiotic* OR prebiotic* OR synbiotic* NOT animals NOT humans Other Sources The electronic search was complemented by screening the references of included studies and the references of relevant reviews. In addition, we hand searched the International Journal of Probiotics and Prebiotics. Clinicaltrials.gov w as searched during the update searches. The database lists a number of registered probiotic trials. Personal files from Evidence- based Practice Center projects on related topic s were also scanned to identify additional relevant studies. The safety data from MedWatch; the Web pages of the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ), including Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition CFSAN and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Reasearch ; and the CFSAN Adverse Event Reporting System database were also explored but did not contribute studies eligible for inclusion in the review. Inclusion S creening This section describes the inclusion cri teria for the review. Inclusion Criteria Participants: o Studies in human participants were eligible for inclusion in the review; animal and in vitro studies were excluded Intervention: o Studies using probiotics or synbiotics to cure, treat, mitigate , or p revent a disease or reduce disease risk (including probiotic drinks or supplements \"to boost immunity\" or similar) were eligible for inclusion in the review. The organisms had to be taken purposefully, and documented cases of infections were included only if use of a probiotic or synbiotic intervention was reported Comparator and Study D esign: 9 o Original research studies were considered without study design restriction, but uncontrolled studies were included only when they explicitly addressed the effect of probiotic or synbiotic intake. Studies primarily testing the effects of a combination of a probiotic and another medication that could also result in adverse events were included only if the study also reported on a group receiving that medication without probiotics or the study explicitly addressed the safety of probiotic intake: Randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ), clinical controlled trials , and cohort studies with at least two arms comparing the use of probiotics or synbiotics to placebo, other treatm ent, or other types of probiotics or synbiotics Before -after studies and time series with measurements before and after introducing probiotics or synbiotics Case series (no comparator) that address the effects of probiotics or synbiotics Case reports that explicitly address the effects of probiotics or synbiotics Mechanistic probiotics or synbiotics studies of all designs addressing patient health outcomes Case-control studies that focus on probiotics or synbiotics as predictors of an adverse event in parti cipants Outcomes: o Studies that addressed adverse patient health outcomes, particularly symptomatic outcomes, were included in the review. Studies that reported only intermediate outcomes such as gene transfer or gastric colonization without reference to participants ' negative health status were not eligible for inclusion in the review. Dislike o r the taste o f the product was not considered eligible adverse events . Studies where efficacy outcomes were identical to adverse events ( e.g., efficacy of probioti cs in the treatment of diarrhea; efficacy of probiotics in the prevention or reduction of negative health outcomes caused by antibiotic treatment) were excluded unless the safety of the probiotics was also explicitly addressed in the publication. As no effectiveness review was undertaken in conjunction with the safety review exacerbations of primary outcomes, such as exacerbation instead of improvement in allergy symptoms in some participants, compared to baseline or in comparison to a control group (treatm ent failures) , were also not included in the review unless these results we re one of the main findings of the publication and highlighted in the abstract of the publication Genus: o Studies investigating Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and/or Bacillus as probiotic agents alone or in combination with other ingredients were eligible for inclusion in the review. Studies were excluded if the genera used could not be verified. Studies administering yogurt or milk produc ts containing only Lactobacillus and/or Streptococcus organisms as starter cultures were not included unless an additional probiotic strain was added to the product. We included studies regardless of whether authors stated that viable organisms were used but interventions of explicitly heat- killed or inactivated organisms were excluded , as the criterion of viability is part of the established definition s of probiotics and interventions using heat- killed forms rarely labeled these preparations \"probiotics.\" 10 Title and Abstract Inclusion Screening The initial relevance screening was performed using the reference manager software Endnote. Endnote allows the import of titles, abstracts, and keywords for each reference identified through electronic searches. All identified records were screened independently by two reviewers in order not to miss potentially relevant studies. Records deemed by at least one reviewer to potentially report safety information were ordered as full text copies for further scrutiny. Identifying safety data is challenging since most publications focus on the clinical efficacy of the intervention in question with either no, sparse, or incomplete and nonsystematic reporting of safety aspects. The review team followed inclusive decision rules for ordering full paper copies of publications in order not to miss studies that might report on adverse events in the full publication but did not indicate so in the title, abstract, or keywords of the publication. In summary, we ordered all publications that targeted the safety of probiotics as full- text articles. In addition, all empirical studies on probiotics in humans that addressed health outcomes were ordered to check the full text publication for data on the safety of probiotics. Publications that clearly addressed animal studies or in vitro studies, comments, opinion pieces without data, unsystematic reviews not specific to safety, and publications that did not address health topics were excluded. Full Text Inclusion Screening Two reviewers independently screened the selected full text publications using a standardized form outlining the inclusion criteria. Any disagreement was resolved through discussion, through consultation with the review team, or with other input such as the local content expert or the technical expert panel (TEP). Studies identified through reference mining were included in the review if they met all the above mentioned inclusion criteria. The inclusion screening process also identified all RCTs reporting patient health outcomes in human participants using probiotics or synbiotics of the genus Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, or Bacillus to cure, treat, mitigate , or prevent a disease or reduce disease risk compared to placebo, another probiotic, prebiotic or synbiotic, other, or no intervention. The number of such relevant RCTs was determined as a denominator for assessing the proportion of those that addressed safety. Data Abstraction and Quality Assessment This report considered two different kinds of publications. Our primary interest was in identifying publications that addressed specific adverse events . However, a number of publications were found that addressed the safety of probiotics but did not report the presence or absence of specific adverse events . For papers that did not address specific adverse events but instead provided only general statements such as \"well tolerated, \" \"no adverse events,\" or \"two participants dropped out due to adverse events \" without specifying whi ch adverse events were assessed, the data abstraction was minimal. These studies were included for reasons of completeness but their informational value for this evidence review is minimal due to the lack of outcome determination. For studies addressing sp ecific adverse events , detailed information was extracted regarding the type of study, the participants , the product containing probiotics or synbiotics, the assessed 11 adverse events , and the results of the study regarding the safety of the intervention (se e abstraction form in Appendix B) . The data were abstracted using defined categories where possible and appropriate, and, if not, using free text. These studies were the primary basis for answering the research question addressed in this review. All extracted information is documented for each study in the evidence tables (Appendix C). Multiple publications of the same study were counted (and extracted, quality assessed and analyzed) as one study to ensure that the same participants did not enter the analys es multiple times. Publications of a particular study were defined by the investigated participant population. Publications that reported the results of two different studies were counted as different studies if both studies met the inclusion criteria of the review (human participants; eligible study design; report of an intervention; Lactobacillus and Bacillus used as probiotic agents; adverse health outcome addressed). For studies with more than one arm, we selected a main treatment arm (arm 1 in evidence tables) and a control group that was most similar to the main treatment arm but did not receive probiotics or synbiotics if available (arm 2 in evidence tables). If additional probiotic and synbiotic groups (arms) were included in the study (including interventions of heat-killed or inactivated organisms), those data are shown as arm 3 and 4 in the evidence tables. We extracted data on all Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces , Streptococcus, Enterococcus, or Bacillus strains contained in the intervention preparations regardless of the probiotic qualities of the strain. If an intervention included a yogurt starter culture with a probiotic strain added, we listed the starter cultures alongside the probiotics strain , if that information was provided. Studies were inconsistent in differentiating strains with assumed probiotic properties from strains without assumed probiotics properties (the product was assumed to have probiotic effects, without attributing these effects to individual strains); hence, we recorded all reported strains. Initially , we had considered contacting authors of primary studies for missing information on the identity of probiotic organisms, that is, whether the administered probiotics strains were verified in the study. However, the quality of reporting on the administered probiotic organisms was rather poor overall, and our resources did not permit contacting what would have been the majority of study authors for this e xtensive literature review. Therefore, study details were extracted as reported. Adverse events . Regarding safety data, we extracted any adverse event reported in the publication and assessed the quantity, quality, and nature of the adverse events . We considered reasons for dropouts as well as adverse events reported for participants finishing the study. We extracted all adverse events for all treatment groups , including those that study authors did not consider related to the intervention. Because such judgments are difficult to make and may depend on the development of the clinical field, we report the complete set of adverse events . Reports of individual treatment failures were not extracted , as these outcomes should be addressed systematically in an effectiveness review extracting all data for the selected outcome. We extracted the number of incidences of the individual adverse events and the number of participants with an adverse even t per group if this information was clearly provided in the publicatio n or could be derived with confidence from the reported information. We extracted the number of participants with adverse events per group and the number of all individual incidences of adverse events per treatment arm. The nature of the reported adverse events w as explored by categoriz ing events with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) classification system. The reported 12 adverse events and reasons for dropping out were classified according to the 27 areas specified in the CTCAE and , where possible, graded in their severity on a scale from 1 (mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated) to 5 (death from adverse event) according to the CTCAE system. The reported adverse events were also assessed as to whether they constituted serious adverse events f ollowing the FDA definitions. Serious adverse events were defined as death, a life-threatening event, hospitalization, a disability -causing event, a congenital anomaly, or events requiring an intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage. Sepsis was classified as a serious adverse event . In trials where mothers and their children received probiotic interventions, only the adverse events for children were considered for pooled analyses because studies reported in consistently on children and their mothers. The number of participants was calculated as the number of mother-child dyads randomized to the treatment groups. Quality . Each study was also assessed regarding its quality. We considered a wide range of study designs in this review, and some quality dimensions were specific to the individual study design (e.g., concealment of treatment alloc ation for RCTs), while others were sources of bias that apply to all study designs ( e.g., blinding of outcome assessors). The quality assessment incorporated the quality of the reporting of the product and probiotic genus, species, and strain; the methods; and the reporting of the assessment and the documentation of observed adverse events. Each quality indicator was scored using a three-point scale (0 = high risk of bias, 1 = unclear or possible risk of bias, 2 = low risk of bias). The specific markers of quality were the quality of the probiotic description (genus, species, and strain), the quality of the reporting of the assessment of adverse events, the quality of the reporting of the adverse events themselves, selection bias, baseline comparability of groups, power calculation for harms, ascertainment of compliance and exposure, method of ascertaining adverse events , random treatment allocation, concealment of allocation, participant blinding, outcome assessor blinding, rate and description of dropouts, intention to treat analysis, presence or handling of confounders, and the potential conflict of interest. Procedure. The data abstraction and quality assessment were performed in duplicate with two reviewers independently reviewing the publications using a standardized form. The numerical results for the eligible outcomes were abstracted and checked by a statistician. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion, through consultation with the review team, or with other input such as from the local content expert or the TEP. Analysis Several of the questions the review set out to address required only descriptive data ( e.g., number of studies reporting adverse events, type of harms, etc.). For studies that reported the presence or absence of a specific adverse event , we extracted two different measures of the quantity of adverse events where possible: the number of participants who experienced adverse events and the number of incidences of individual, reported adverse events. For controlled studies, w e extracted the number of participants with adverse events and the number of individual incidences for each intervention arm. In cases where the number of events was reported for one group within a study but not explicitly for the other group, we assumed t hat zero events occurred for this second group. 13 For each study, w e extracted the total number of participants entering the study and the number of participants per treatment arm. Th e latter was the number of participants per group as randomized or initial ly entering the treatment group where stated; in nonrandomized and single group studies we used the number of participants in the treatment group as reported. In addition, we extracted the number of dropouts and the number of dropouts due to adverse events per group. Where appropriate, we pooled results across studies in a meta -analysis to obtain a summar y estimate . Studies were included in pooled analyses if they reported complete information on the total number of participants in each treatment group, as well as the number of participants with events in each group or the number of adverse event incidences per group. W e identified a large number of RCTs and restricted the pooled analyses to parallel RCTs . Trials that did not randomize participants or that used a crossover design were used only for sensitivity analyses , where appropriate . When pooling studies with adverse event incidences, we excluded those trials where the total number of adverse events incidences exceeded the number of participants per treatment arm (this was very rare but not impossible as participants can experience more than one adverse event) . For parallel RCTs , we computed the relative risk for adverse events , comparing treatment and control groups, and the absolute risk per group and compared risk differences across groups. Where the number of cases with an adverse event for a treatment arm was zero, an increment of 0.5 was added, where required for the specific statistical analysis. Studies were pooled with random effects analysis usin g the DerSimonian -Laird procedure, using the metafor package, v1.4 (Viechtbauer, 2010) within R 2.10.2. We report t he pooled relative risk and risk diff erences together with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Pertinent results were depicted graphically in forest plots. Each forest plot indicates the point estimate and confidence interval associated with the data reported for each included study . The area of each square is proportional to the study's weight in the meta- analysis. Throughout, the forest plots show the log of the relative risk on the horizontal axis. The evidence report set out to answer a large number of Key Questions pertaining to product and participant factors . We primarily sought s tudies that report ed direct comparisons to answer Key Questions. For example, studies comparing two different delivery vehicles within the same study were used to address differences associated with the delivery vehicle. Where no direct comparisons or only few comparisons were identified , or w here comparisons were unusual or inappropriate (e.g., comparing effects in children and in adults), we used subgroup analyses and metaregressions to investigate the factor in question. Subgroup analyses stratified RCTs by the factor in question. F or example, a separate pooled analysis comparing intervention and control groups was undertaken for studies in children, in adults, and in elderly participants to investigate whether safety results vary by age. Metaregression s were undertaken to investigate the potential predictors (or moderators) of effects such as the age of the participants. In the metaregressions, we incorporated additional predictors into the model, assessing the 95% CI and p- value associated with the ratio of relative risk for the particular predictor. This type of analysis can identify interaction effects, that is, whether the risk compared to control is statistically significantly higher than compared to the risk seen in other study types. Where a categorical moderator had more than two levels, we first assessed the joint significance of the predictor before examining the univariate effects. Metaregressions and subgroup analyses are indirect comparisons across stu dies and were interpreted with caution , as they are confounded by many factors. 14 The proportion of RCTs that address ed adverse events was also determined relative to the total number of identified RCTs reporting patient health outcomes in human participants using probiotics or synbiotics of the genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, , or Bacillus to cure, treat, mitigate , or prevent a disease or reduce disease risk compared to placebo, another probiotic or synbiotic, other intervention, or no intervention. This assessment answers the question of what proportion of high evidence level studies do and do not address the safety of using probiotics or synbiotics. This analysis is based on a literature scoping approach of the excluded literature and is an estimate only. Rating the Strength of the Evidence For each of the key research questions, a synopsis of the evidence was undertaken. The body of evidence consisting of all studies that were identified that contribute to answer ing the research question was rated according to the following criteria: risk of bias, consistency, directness, and precision. The risk of bias was assessed for each study by taking the study design and the results of the quality assessment of the individual study into account. The quality criteria are outlined above. In addition, the consistency of results across studies was considered. For this dimension, we checked whether the direction of results was similar across comparable studies. The directn ess of the evidence takes into account whether any head- to-head trials were identified that allowed a direct comparison (between two probiotic genera, for example) within the same study rather than having to rely on indications across studies. Across -study comparisons are confounded by many factors, results may be misleading, and conclusions from indirect comparisons have to be regarded with caution. The precision relates to the confidence intervals around a summary estimate, the range of values that have t o be considered true based on the given data. In addition, this dimension considers, for example, whether the risk of adverse events in the intervention group is statistically significantly different from the risk of adverse events in a control group. Finally, for each question we graded the strength of the evidence that was identified for the particular topic. The strength of evidence reflects the confidence in answering each Key Question. The following categories were used: high, moderate, low, or insufficient. High indicates that we have confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect; the research question can be sufficiently answered with the available evidence. Moderate indicates that we have only moderate confidence that the identified evidence reflects the true effect. A rating of low indicates that we have only low confidence that the identified evidence reflects the true effect and that it is likely that future research will change currently available estimates of effects. When the strength of evidence is rated as insufficient, it indicates that evidence to answer the research question is unavailable. The absence of evidence does not equal the absence of an effect; it indicates that there is insufficient evidence to answer the research questio n. A summary of the general approach is outlined in the Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews (AHRQ, 2007). 15 Results The literature search revealed a large research volume on the topic of probiotics, with a particular increase in research publications shown in recent years. All databases were searched from inception. Figure 3 plots the identified publications by the year of publication. Figure 3.

Literature flow Electronic Database Search n = 11,201 Reference Mining , Expert Identified, and Hand Search n = 776 Full Text Articles Screened n = 2,189 Background (not included in analyses ) n = 315 Subsequen tly Excluded n = 1 ,252; Reasons: 636 Adverse events / safety not addressed 243 No Intervention 141 Ineligible Participants 101 Ineligible Design 86 Not probiotic intervention or ineligible genus 45 Duplicate Excluded based on title and abstract (animal study, in vitro, no data, unsystematic reviews not specific to safety, not health ) Included in the review (meeting all in clusion criteria) n = 622 Specific harm addressed, thus selected for detailed data extraction and quality assessment n = 387 291 RCTs and CCTs 53 Case Series 43 Case Studies Nonspecific safety statements only n = 235 Of all identified publications, 9,788 were excluded on title and abstract level where publications clearly addressed animal studies, in vitro studies, comments and opinion pieces without data, unsystematic reviews not specific to safety, and publications that did not address health topics. We ordered 2,189 full text articles for further scrutiny. Applying the standardized form to inclusion screen full text papers by two independent reviewers , 1,252 publications were excluded. Excluded publications a re listed in Appendix D with the primary reason for exclusion. The screening process considered, in this order, 17 monitoring and/or reporting of adverse events , participants, genus, design, intervention, and duplicates. Only one reason for exclusion was recorded , although most publications would have not passed two or three exclusion criteria. Also listed in the appendix are 315 studies that were classified as background papers. These were mostly reviews used for further reference mining or multiple publications of included studies. Overall, 622 studies met inclusion criteria. The full list of included studies is shown in the appendix together with the source the publication was identified from. The electronic databases were searched in a particular order , starting with PubMed as outlined in the search strategy. The majority of included studies were indexed in PubMed. A substantial number of studies were identified through reference screening of included studies and background papers. The included studies were then screened again in a further step to differentiate studies that addressed a specific adverse event from those that did not (nonspecific safety statements). Potentially Relevant S tudies Not Addressing S afety To estimate the proportion of existing probi otics studies currently found in the literature that are included in this safety review , we enumerated the probiotics randomized controlled trials (RCTs ) reporting on patient outcomes that were found in our searches. We then calculated the proportion of RC Ts included in this review as an estimate of the proportion of currently available studies that were included. RCTs are regarded as high evidence level studies , and of all published research studies, these should be more likely to adhere to good reporting practices, which include the reporting of adverse events . We have identified 774 RCTs in our literature searches that were potentially relevant for the Key Questions and were theoretically eligible to be included in this review based on the participant, intervention, genus, and study design criteria of this review . Of these relevant RCTs , 446 (58 percent ) met inclusion criteria for this review because the y addressed the safety of probiotics. All other RCTs reported on relevant interventions, in relevant participant groups , but they did not address adverse patient health outcomes as defined in this evidence review. Of all published RCTs that we identified in our searches , 279 (36 percent ) reported on the presence or absence of a specific adverse event . Included S tudies With N onspecific S afety S tatements Evidence Table C6, Non specific Safety Statements ,in Appendix C summarizes the 235 identified studies that made only vague safety statements indicating that \"there were no adverse events \" or that the intervention was \" well tolerated \" but gave no indication what kind of adverse events were screened for or did occur. The evidence table shows what the publication reported regarding the assessment of adverse events and the safety results. The majority of these stud ies were RCT s. Very few included studies were \" mechanistic studies,\" that is, specifically investigating the mechanism of action with which probiotic organism s potentially achieve effects. Mechanistic studies rarely addressed patient health outcomes, including adverse events. Only few studies (67/235) provided details about the assessment procedure ( e.g. \"any side effects were also recorded ,\"), but no specific outcomes that were monitored in the study were reported. The large majority of studies did not ref er to the assessment of adverse events. The table also shows the investigated genus, species, strain, and form of probiotic organism s given, as well as the potency and the administered dose, and the product name, where applicable, for these studies. Lactob acillus was by far the most common ly investigated genus, and about 18 three- fourths of the identified studies used products that included Lactobacillus alone or in combination with other genera. Enterococcus and Bacillus studies accounted for less than 5 percent of the sample. Figure 5 shows the frequency of the genera of all strains used in the studies. Figure 5. Included strains by genus in studies with nonspecific safety statements 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 Several publications reported the species and in some cases subspecies th at were investigated. Common in this sample were Lactobacillus rhamnosus coagulans . One -third of the studies did not report the investigated strain. These studies provided no information on what exactly was studied or at least what was supposed to be studied. In addition, most studies did not state that any efforts were made to test the administered micro organism(s) . In more than half of the identified publications, the form of the organism was not described, such as whether the organism was active, lyophilized (freeze -dried), or heat killed. Most common was the description \" live,\" \"active ,\" or \"viable \" (32 percent); reference to freeze- dried stored organisms was made in a quarter of the publications. No studies that employed heat-killed organisms and provided vague safety statement s were identified using the search algorithm. The potency of the studied pr obiotic strain was reported for a third of the articles (expressed as colony -forming units [cfu] for bacterial strains ), although with rare exceptions, the potency does not appear to have been tested as part of the study. Thus, t he reported potency information may have been that provided by the manufacturer of the product. The actual potency can deviate from the product label and can be influenced by the delivery vehicle that is employed in the study so the stated potency information is only a rough indicator. In addition, the dose information was usually not clearly documented or not linked to the potency information, or the potency and dose w ere reported only on the product, not at the individual organism level, so that in most cases the daily amount of exposure of the probiotic organisms remained unknown. A third of these publications stated that the investigated intervention had \" no side effects .\" The statement s \"no adverse effects ,\" \"well tolerated ,\" and \" no adverse events \" were also, and all equally, co mmon, each found in about 20 percent of the identified publications. The statement \"safe\" was a rarely used expression , accounting for fewer than 5 percent of the publications, 19 presumably acknowledging that this statement is very difficult to ascertain with a single study. The remaining studies used other expressions. None of these publications clearly reported the ir basis for the conclusions related to the absence of harms . That is, they did not state the specific parameters they monitored, or characteriz e the encountered adverse events further. A small number of publications monitored specific harms according to the methods section but the results were not reported. Studies describing the presence or absence of a specific adverse event were eligible for d etailed data extraction , are described in the next section , and were used to answer the Key Questions . Included S tudies Addressing Specific Harms A total of 387 studies were identified that addressed a specific adverse event . These studies were used to answer the Key Questions posed by the sponsors. Evidence Tables Detailed information o n the included studies is shown in five evidence tables in Appendix C. Table C1 lists the study details and participant information , table C2 shows the intervention details , Table C3 outlines the assessment and analyses , Table C4 summarizes the reported results and Table C5 shows the quality assessment. Studies appear in alphabetical order ( by name of the first author) within study design categories. For this categorization , we differentiated three study design groups : controlled trials, observational studies, and case studies. The nonrandomized controlled trials and the crossover and parallel randomized controlled trials were extracted in the same category ; the observational study design group included only uncontrolled case series. Study and Participant Details Table C1 : Study and Participant Details provides an overview of the type of study and the included participants. Almost all included studies were published as articles. Although abstracts and letters with data were eligible for inclusion in the review, these publications accounted for fewer than 5 percent of the included publications. Multiple publications about the same study were extracted as one study, regardless of the number of publications employed to report the data. Publications reporting more than one study, in particular with different research designs, are shown as multiple studies. Fewer than one-third of studies reported that safety was one of the main aims of the publication. The efficacy of the intervention was the most common research question addressed by the included studies. In all, 49 percent of included studies were conducted in European countries; Italian publications alone accounted for 10 percent of the sample. Studies were included regardless of the language of the publication. The number of U.S. studies included (11 percent ) was similar to the number of Asian studies (16 percent ). We determined the country by the study participants, not the authors of the publication. The individual countries are shown in the evidence table. The majority of included studies employed a modest number of participants, that is, ranging between 11 and 100 participants. However, we also identified 111 larger studies (2 9 percent of all included studies) with more than 100 participants. Small studies with between 1 and 10 participants constituted 14 percent of the entire sample of included studies; most, but not all, were case studies . Figure 6 shows the number of participants included in the identified studies. 20 Figure 6. Number of participants in included studies Across all studies and treatment arms , 24,615 intervention participants used a probiotics product, of which 21,403 were in the main treatment group. Across all s tudies, 16,574 participants were allocated to a nonprobiotic control group. In terms of study design, parallel RCTs accounted for two- thirds of the entire sample addressing specific adverse event s. We only classified those studies as RCTs that explicitly stated the random allocation to treatment and control group. All other trials were categorized as clinical controlled trials (CCT). We distinguished parallel and crossover RCTs , because with a crossover design , a carryover effect from the intervention phase cannot be ruled out and may lead to misinterpretation of the data. These trials included all studies where the intervention was under the control of the investigator. Cohort studies comparing two cohorts or case-control studies that addressed the safety o f probiotics were not found. Cohort studies compare groups of participants using probiotic organism s with a group of participants not using probiotics; the intervention, that is, the use of probiotic organisms, is not controlled by the investigator but self- selected by the participant , and the data obtained are purely observational. Case-control studies are defined by the outcome, that is, a specific harm, and the intervention, the use of probiotic organisms, is investigated as a possible risk factor for the outcome in question. The remaining studies we included were case series and case studies, which represented 14 percent and 11 percent respectively . Case series report on a number of patients receiving the same intervention without a control group. Some c ase series were before-after studies , but for this safety analys is, these studies were not differentiated from other case series , because the preintervention data for safety aspects were typically missing so there was no baseline that allowed a comparison . The included c ase studies reported on one or more cases of adverse events attributed to probiotic organisms. We also categorized the health status of the participants taking part in the included studies. We differentiated generally healthy, critically ill or high- risk patients , and participants with medium or indeterminate risk on the continuum from generally healthy to critically ill. Two - thirds of studies were in participants who were neither generally healthy nor critically ill. These participants were suffering from a variety of health complaints such as diarrhea, ulcerative colitis, or bacterial vaginosis . Some of the participant samples were generally healthy 21 participants (81/387). The smallest group of included participants w as critically ill or high- risk patients, for example patients currently being treated in an intensive care unit or babies with very low birth weight. The participants' specific health problems were also extracted. We also noted whether participant groups of interest to the Key Qu estions were systematically excluded from each study, such as newborn and very young children; elderly participants; or immune - compromised, critically ill, or high-risk patients. In all, 52 studies explicitly reported that immunocompromised patients were excluded from the study. Another 73 studies excluded pregnant women, and 36 excluded breastfeeding or lactating women. For each study, w e noted the reason for which the probiotic organisms were given. Seventy - nine percent of studies used probiotic organisms in an attempt to either treat or prevent a specific condition. Although probiotic organisms can be admi nistered in the form of a food or food ingredient, a drug, or a dietary supplement, and our search or inclusion criteria did not favor one particular fo rm over another, the probiotic organisms were administered in a clinical context in the vast majority of identified studies , that is, testing the efficacy or effectiveness of the preparation to treat or prevent a clinical indication. On a related note, although definitions of drugs vary across countries (as reflected in the international literature) , the vast majority of interventions were not commercial food or dietary supplement products (see also Evidence Table C2, Intervention). The evidence table also lists pertinent cotreatment s such as antibiotics, immunosuppressants, steroids, or dietary therapies. Of all included studies, 28 percent reported that participants also took antibiotics while participating in the probiotics study. Intervention The Evidence T able C2 , Intervention presents an overview of the specific interventions evaluated in the included studies. When provided, the name of the product under evaluation was extracted . Furthermore , we extracted the delivery vehicle for the probiotic organism s where reported : in one-quarter of all included studies, th e delivery vehicle was a pill or capsule. We also extracted the target of the intervention, since we identified somestudies that gave probiotic organisms to pregnant women, their babies after deli very, or both. We also categorized the studies as to whether they investigated only one probiotic strain or several (i.e., a mixed product). A single -genus product was investigated in 55 percent of studies. In 39 percent of studies, more than one strain was included in the intervention preparation. The latter studies included those in which the probiotic agents were given in yogurt or other milk products, and we have included Lactobacillus and Streptococcus in this evaluation where reported , even when the study did not claim any probiotic characteristics for the yogurt strains (studies were inconsistent in differentiating strains with assumed probiotic properties or attributing probiotic properties to the studied product in its entirety). We carefully avoi ded searching by the names of particular strains , species , or genera. However, the majority of identified studies targeted at least one Lactobacillus strain ( 73 percent ). In all, 34 percent of studies included at least one Bifidobacterium strain . The other genera of interest to the report were represented in only 18 percent (Streptococcus ), 12 percent (Saccharomyces ), 4 percent ( 3 percent (Bacillus ) of studies , respectively . Figure 7 shows the number of strains by genus that were investigated in the included studies in the various treatment groups. Many studies used exclusively one Lactobacillus strain and many studies included more than one Lactobacillus strain but no other genera in the intervention. 22 Figure 7. Included strains by genus 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 We also categorized studies according to whether the intervention included only probiotics, or a combination of probiotics and prebiotics, that is, synbiotics. Fewer than 10 percent of studies stated clearly that they used a synbiotic product or reported the addition of ingredients with assumed prebiotic properties. Details of the interventions were documented only sketchily . Studies reported the investigated genus and often the species but strain information was often not reported, as indicated by the large number of \" not available ( n/a)\" entries in the evidence table. The evidence tables include the species as reported regardless of reclassifications on genus, species , or strain level based on new evidence. Apart from the genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus , and Pediococcus , and Propionibacterium cerevisiae and reported Enterococcus species were faecalis and salivarius, sanguis, as Streptococcus faecium . The st udied Bacillus IP, licheniformis, oligonitrophilus, stearothermophilus , and subtilis . Of all included studies, 43 percent did not report on included strains. The form of the probiotic strain was also often not reported: 62 percent of studies did not report whether the organisms in the various intervention arms were in active, lyophilized , or heat-killed form, and/or whether the tested organisms were viable. For studies that reported using a commercial product, w e extracted only the intervention detail as reported by the authors, that is, we did not search for information from manufacturers to determine the composition of the product . The review covers the international literature and was 23 searched without restrict ion by publication year; it is possible that the product compositions vary across countries and have also changed over time. Fewer than 10 percent of studies clearly reported that they verified the probiotic strains that were given to participants as part of the study. The verification checked for the included strains, whether any contaminants were identified , and /or the number of active organisms. The evidence table also shows the dose information as reported by the individual study authors. For each study, we extracted the daily intake of probiotic products where possible. The dose information was often incomplete , that is, the information provided was insufficient to calculate participants' actual daily or overall study exposure. The evidence table also reports the length of the intervention in months. Many intervention periods in the included studies were of short duration, often lasting for only 1 week. We categorized studies by short -term, medium, and long-term use. Definin g short -term use as 1 month or less and long- term use as 1 year or longer, we note that almost half of the included studies (46 percent ) reported an intervention period of 1 month or less, and only 5 percent of studies explicitly investigated the long -term use of probiotic organisms, that is, use of probiotic product s for 1 year or longer. I n the remaining studies, medium intervention durations w ere studied (more than 1 month but less than 12 months) or in some cases , it could not be established how long the probiotic product was taken. Figure 8 shows the individual study durations in months. Figure 8. Intervention duration in months We also differentiated the route of administration of the probiotic product. In two -thirds of studies, probiotic organism s were administered orally . In 10 percent of the se studies, enteral feeding tubes were used , owing to the fact that a number of studies evaluated probiotics in critically ill patients (see Evidence Table C1 , Study and Participant Details) . In controlled studies, the probiotic intervention was most commonly compared to a placebo , or a group receiving probiotic organisms in addition to another medication, product , or treatment (the standard intervention) was compared to a group receiving only the standard intervention without the probiotic addition. For studies with multiple interventions , we chose as the primary intervention arm the one that differed from the control group only in the administration of a probiotic. 24 Assessment We distinguished descriptions of the assessment of adverse events from the reported events . Evidence Table C4 , Results lists all reported events ; however, the Evidence Table C3 , Assessment lists the specific adverse events that were reportedly assessed according to the methods section of the publication . We noted all reported published systems used to record, categorize, and grade adverse events; however, this information was not very common in the included studies. The assessed safety parameters of controlled trials are summarized in Key Question 1a. The information on observational studies is summarized in Key Question 1d. We also categorized the duration of followup. In particular , in studies with multiple publications, this categorization was based on the longest reported followup period. In terms of short-, medium-, or long-term effects of probiotics use, outcomes were often elicited immediately after the end of the intervention period. The use of the probiotic product had either recently stopped , or in some instances was still ongoing at the time of the followup a ssessment . One-third of included studies assessed the effects of a probiotic intervention within 6 months after the intervention. Very few studies assessed long- term effects of probiotic use, i.e., effects reported more than 1 year after the treatment had stopped. Results Evidence Table C4 , Results lists the reported results separately for each treatment group in the included studies (arm 1 to 4). The table documents the quantity, the quality, and the nature of the reported adverse events. For each study, w e also extracted the total number of participants per study, the number of participants in each group at the time of randomization where applicable, the specific reported adverse event s, the number of dropouts, and the number of dropouts due to adverse events . In terms of the quantity of adverse events , we extracted the number of adverse event incidences separately for each treatment arm. In addition, we extracted the number of participants who experienced one or more adverse events per treatment arm. Since participants could experience multiple adverse events, the number of par ticipants with adverse events and the total number of individual adverse events do not coincide and were extracted individually. In terms of the nature of the adverse events, as outlined in the Methods section , we extracted the exact adverse events as reported by the authors of the publication, and in addition, we applied the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) system and categorized the events according to 27 categories. The R oman numerals in the evidence table refer to the CTCAE category, e.g., VII is gastrointestinal disorders, XII is infections and infestations, and XXVI I is a miscellaneous category for events not covered by the CTCAE system or where adverse events were reported in a way that did not allow the assignment to a single category. In brackets after the individual adverse event , we added a characterization where possible (e.g. mild, or classified as 1 according to the CTCAE system). However, this information was usually not available. For each individual adverse event , we extracted the reported number of instances of the event . In terms of the quality of the adverse events, we assessed for each reported adverse event whether it represents a serious adverse event (SAE) as outlined in the Methods section to distinguish the large number of minor complaints from the serious events. In the evidence table, the latter are noted as \" (SAE)\" for each applicable adverse event. We also extracted a number of additional variables pertinent to the Key Questions such as the number of hospitalizations and the duration of hospitalization, where reported. Whether the 25 administered organism was recovered from the gastrointestinal tract, serum, mouth, or vagina (indicator of efficacy or safety) ; the need for antibiotic therapy to treat an infection ; and occurrences of antibiotic resistance were also extracted and are explained in detail in the following sections. We noted that the quality of the reporting seems to have increased in recent years; however , it is challenging to quantify this subjective observation. A logistic regression of the number of individual adverse events (including zero events, i.e., reporting on the presence or absence of adverse events) showed that the reporting of gastrointestinal events increased (B=0.048; p=0.010), however, there was a larger increase in the reporting of infections and infestations (B=0.014; p<0.0010). Quality Evidence Table C5 , Quality summarizes the quality of the individual included studies , as judged by two independent reviewers. W e applied a number of quality criteria covering the quality of the reporting as well as internal validity criteria for the study design. Only \"met criteria \" or \"possibly met/not enough information to judge the quality \" are displayed in the table , to allow an easy overview of the entire sample. Figure 9 synthesizes the quality of the reporting and the risk of bias for all asses sed variables for the included 387 studies meeting all inclusion criteria. Figure 9. Quality of the reporting and risk of bias in included studies 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 AE= adverse event; ITT=intention -to-treat 26 For each study, we evaluated the quality of the intervention reporting : Only studies reporting the administered strain as well as the genus and species met the criterion (211/387 studies). The assessment of adverse events was judged as clear and well reported by the two independent reviewers in 93/3 87 studies. The repo rting of the adverse event s themselves was judged adequate in 229/387 studies. We also assessed the selection of the sample : 27/3 87 studies were judged to protect adequately against selection bias , for example, through the use of consecutive patients or explicitly representative samples drawn from the study population. A lso, for controlled trials, we assessed the comparab ility of the groups allocated to the probiotics and to the control interventions. Of all controlled trials , 195/291 relevant studies were classified as adequate; these studies reported basic baseline information on both groups, and the data were considered comparable. As a quality measure for the study , we also judged whether the study reported a power calculation that considered an y advers e event. Of all included studies, six studies assessed in advance whether their study would be adequately powered to show a statistically significant difference in adverse events between treatment arms , should they occur. Because w e expected to find a number of case -control studies, we also assessed the studies for exposure ascertainment . In 194/3 87 studies, the reviewers were relatively certain that the probiotics were used as described, for example, because studies reported on the compliance of the participants, or it was assumed that the probiotic organisms were taken as indicated because studies took place in a controlled hospital environment (i.e., most likely administered by hospital staff). The reviewers also judged the method of harms surveillance. R eported adverse events can differ across studies due to the method used to elicit adverse events. We differentiated passive surveillance, such as health care providers record ing adverse events when spontaneously disclosed by participants, from active surveillance, for example, mention of a structured assessment of harms that was part of the study protocol as evidence that participants were explicitly prompted to report adverse events . In total, 172/3 87 studies were classified as using active surveillance, w hile for the other studies only passive surveillance could be assumed , or it was unclear from the reporting of the study. Among the included studies were a large number of RCTs . In total, 121 studies described as randomized had a randomization sequence approach that was described and considered adequate (e.g., use of table of random numbers, computer generated sequences). We also judged the concealment of treatment allocation \u2014whether study personnel were able to predict the study arm in which the participan t would end up or whether the allocation to treatment groups was concealed. Only 56 out of all 266 parallel RCTs reported treatment allocation concealment. Finally, we assessed participant and outcome assessor blinding. In 223 studies, the participants were blinded to the treatment they received; they did not know whether they consumed or were exposed to the probiotic organisms in question, a placebo , or another control preparation. In a similar number of studies (221/3 87), the outcome assessor was described as blinded: it was assumed that the person eliciting the study outcomes was not aware whether the participant was taking probiotic organisms or not. When assessing the risk for adverse events in a particular study , it is important to identify the number of dropouts (withdrawals) . Whereas p articipants completing the intervention may report no adverse events, adverse events can lead to withdrawal (and might or might not be accounted for). In 290/3 87 studies, the numbers of withdrawals and dropouts were reported and the reason s for drop ping out were described , or it was clearly reported that there were no dropouts and all participants were followed up. Of all parallel RCTs , 75 percent were jud ged by two independent 27 reviewers to report adequately on withdrawals. As a general quality measure, we also assessed whether studies reported an intention- to-treat analysis. In all, 99 included trials reported that they analyzed participants according to the treatment group to which they were originally assigned regardles s of whether they completed the intervention or switched to another treatment. We also assessed whether studies reported any attempts to investigate or to avoid upfront confounding factors. Of all included studies, 126 were classified as attempting to addr ess confounders, either through statistical analyses ( e.g., multivariate analyses) or by features of the study design ( e.g., matching control groups). We also assessed the potential for conflict s of interest. We differentiated studies that were funded by a manufacturer of probiotics and studies where the conflict of interest was somewhat unclear because of lack of reporting or because the researcher's affiliation indicated no conflict of interest but the article reported that the study products were donated by a manufacturer. In 61/387 included studies, the authors explicitly state d in the publication that they had no conflict of interest. Key Question 1. What is the evidence that the active ( e.g., live or viable) and ingredients or in combination with other probiotics or prebiotics in all delivery vehicles (and formulations) when used to cure, treat, mitigate or prevent a disease or reduce disease risk are safe in the short term? Long term? All 387 studies meeting criteria for full data abstraction were considered to answer Key Question 1. Studies were considered , regardless of the genus, species, or strain ; form ; and delivery vehicles. Probiotics as well as synbiotics are included in the summary. We have identified only very few studies that investigated Enterococcus or Bacillus strains and that could be included in this review, despite an extensive and unrestricted search. The following results primarily pertain to Lactobacillus , alone or in combination with other genera, most often Bifidobacterium strains. Very few included studies (nine in total) investigated long- term effects defined as reporting on followup periods of one or more years . (1a) What safety parameters are collected in clinical studies (Phases I -IV)? The monitored safety parameter s of the included CCTs and parallel and crossover RCT s are shown in Evidence Table C3, Assessment in Appendix C. We distinguished as sessed harms from actually reported adverse events. Evidence Table C3, Assessment lists only outcomes that were explicitly monitored according to the publication. The majority of publications reported little information on the assessment of adverse events , including what adverse events were monitored. Safety was one of the primary outcomes in only 55 publications out of all 291 identified CCTs, and parallel and crossover RCTs. Often, adverse events were not specified a priori . Many trials did not mention safety or adverse events in the study outcome section (103 trials ). A substantial number of publications reported in the methods section of the publication that 'adverse events' were monitored but did not define these outcomes further and reported no examples of what kind of events would be monitored (55 studies). The \"AE Non- specific\" category in Evidence Table C3, Assessment 28 includes those studies that explicitly monitored for any adverse event that occurred during the study period. The trials rarely rep orted the use of a protocol or a systematic approach for t he assessment of adverse events . Some publications used published tools to categorize adverse events. Allen (2010) recorded all untoward medical occurrences and these were then independently reviewed. The authors referred to the Directive 2001/20/EC and the ICD10 criteria. Aso (1992 and 1995) evaluated adverse reactions according to the criteria of the Japan Society for Cancer Therapy (Furue et al., 1986). Chouraqui (2008) and Dylewski (2010) reported that adverse events were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA) . Hemm erling (2009) used Vaginal Microbicide Studies, WHO/CONRAD colposcopy manual 1994, and DAIDS Adult Toxicity Table (Division of AIDS, 2007) . The severity of adverse reactions was assessed using the C TCAE , version 2.0 in the trial by Naito (2008). The Common Toxicity Criteria of the National Cancer Institute of Canada scale version 2 was used by Osterlund (2007) to assess and grade any adverse events. Sykora (2005) used a tool for H. pylori treatment side effects (de Boer, 1996) and assessed the causal relationship of the encountered side effects to the treatment. Wind (2010) also used published tools to assess safety (Gastrointestinal symptom rating scale, Svedlund et al., 1988; King's stool chart, Whelan et al., 2004). When specified, t he assessment of adverse events was either by pr ovider assessment at the time of clinical examination ( 165 trials), by patient diary (68 trials), by questionnaire (24 trials), or explicitly by telephone interview (21 trials) , and some trials used lab test s (24 trials), but a substantial number of trials (52 trials) did not specify how adverse events were elicited. In studies with provider assessment, i t was usually unclear whether participants were prompted to report adverse events, whether clinicians routinely checked for particular events, or whether i t was left up to the participants to mention events that they noticed. We suspected that studies that completed an Investigational New Drug (IND) application were more likely to report a systematic approach to assessing harms, but only one publication ( McF arland , 1994) reported on the completion of an IND application. Individual outcomes that were frequently explicitly monitored were \" diarrhea\" (37 trials) , \"vomiting \" (27 trials), \"constipation\" (22 trials), \"flatulence trials) , \"abdominal pain\" trials) , \"bloating\" (10 trials) , \" nausea\" (9 trials) (see Evidence Table C3 , Assessment in Appendix C). Signs of infections were rarely explicitly monitored in the included trials . The outcome \"s epsis \" or signs of sepsis was assessed in 11 of the included trials. Nine trials reported that \"infections\" were monitored, two trials explicitly monitored for bacteremia, and none of the trials stated in the method s section that fungemia was monitored. The outcome \" death \" was specified as a monitored adverse event in nine trials (this number does not include studies assessing mortality as an efficacy or effectiveness measure). Data on hospitalizations are presented in detail in Key Question 5. All studies eligible for full data extraction had to report on a specific adverse event . All specific adverse events that were recorded are presented in Evidence Table C4, Results in Appendix C . These adverse events were reported in the publication, even though the study might not ha ve stated upfront that safety was assessed or defined what would be considered an adverse event. The table covers the presence as well as the absence of adverse events (zero events) . In other words, the publications that reported identif ied no instances of a particular harm . The specific outcome most commonly reported on across studies was \" diarrhea.\" In total, 59 studies reported the absence or presence of diarrhea incidences in the treatment arms. This was 29 followed by \" vomiting \" (39 studies) . Incidences of \"death \" or the absence of incidences was reported in 36 studies. The outcome \" nausea \" was recorded in 24 studies. \" Sepsis \" or \"septicemia \" was reported on in 21 studies. Twenty-three studies reported on \"abdominal pain\" and 30 on \"constipation.\" \" Headache \" was reported on in 22 studies. Flatulence was reported on in 19 studies, and 16 studies reported on the presence or absence of \"bloating\" incidences. All other outcomes were addressed in fewer than 10 studies. In almost all included studies, the outcom e assessment took place shortly after probiotic organism s were given (assessing short - and medium- term effects) , and the intervention period was less than one year long (studying short- and medium -term use) . (1b) What harms are reported in clinical studie s (Phases I -IV)? For all CCT s and parallel and crossover RCT s, we recorded which adverse events were reported and how many participants per treatment group experienced the presence or absence of this particular outcome . In the evidence tables, the study arms appear in this order: main treatment group, control group, and additional treatment groups to which probiotics were given. Exact adverse events as reported were extracted and are shown in Evidence Table C4 , Results , in Appendix C . We extracted all rep orted results, including zero events (e.g., zero cases of sepsis). We classified the adverse events according to the CTCAE system and added the corresponding codes I to XXVII . Where possible, we graded the severity of the symptom on a scale from 1 to 5 or characterized the adverse event further if additional information was provided (in brackets after the harm). Studies reported on the presence or absence of a very large number of individual outcomes. The number of reported adverse events per study varied greatly, presumably depending in part on the thoroughness of the adverse event recording and potentially in part on the type of study; for example, most studies whose primary aim was to assess the efficacy of probiotics reported one or more cases of each of a small number of adverse events encountered. Other studies, the primary aim of which was to specifically investigate the safety of probiotics in substantial participant samples, compared the incidence of relatively common occurrences such as colic in inf ants. Finally, this review also considered studies of \"failed effectiveness,\" that is, studies that assessed the efficacy or effectiveness of probiotics in preventing a particular condition (e.g., antibiotic -induced diarrhea or allergic dermatitis), where, unexpectedly, the risk for the condition actually increased in the probiotics group (rather than decreasing, as was hoped); thus, the primary outcome (efficacy, or lack thereof) became the safety issue. Frequent Individual Adverse Events The most commonly reported individual adverse events were \" death ,\" \"'diarrhea ,\" \"constipation,\" \" nausea,\" \" respiratory infections ,\" ,\" ,\" and \"pain on micturition .\" This analysis considers only the exact wording; similar symptoms or syndromes were not grouped. A categorization of reported adverse events is undertaken in response to Key Question 2c. Only data that indicated the treatment group in which the adverse event occ urred were considered. Across all trials, 177 incidences of \"deaths\" were reported in probiotic treatment groups, and 174 incidences were reported in a control group. Mortality was recorded in 32 trials , and each contributed one or two cases to the total number, with the exception of Kerac (2009), Besselink (2008), and Awad (2010). Kerac (2009) monitored deaths in children with severe acute 30 malnutrition and reported 108/399 deaths in a group receiving synbiotics compared to 119/396 in children using a control formula. The PROPATRIA trial reported by Besselink et al. (2008) , a study of failed effectiveness , reported on 24 deat hs in a treatment group compared to 9 cases in the control group in patients with acute pancreatitis. The deaths were not directly associated with cases of sepsis caused by the administered organism (0 incidences). Awad (2010) reported 5/60 deaths in a Lactobacillus acidophilus interv ention group for the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis and sepsis compared to 6/30 neonates receiving placebo; however mortality was 14/60 in the heat- killed Lactobacillus acidophilus group. Of the other trials that reported on the group the decease d participant was originally allocated to, eight recorded more death incidences in one or more probiotic or synbiotic treatment groups compared to a of deaths across groups (Dewan, 2007; Klarin, 2005; Tempe, 1985). Several studies reported that no deaths occurred in either treatment group of the trial (Anukam, 2008; Delia, Rio, 2002). total, 130 cases of diarrhea were reported in probiotics treatment groups, compared to 126 cases in a control group; the outcome was assessed in a large number of studies. Individual study results varied, sometimes favoring the probiotics treatment group, sometimes the control group, or reporting an equal number of incidences as documented in the Evidence Table C4 , Results. Constipation was assessed in a large number of studies that contributed 1 or 2 cases of constipation in each of the treatment groups to the total number of 78 cases in a probiotics intervention and 73 cases in a control group. McFarland (1994) reported eight cases of constipation in the treatment group and two in the placebo group. Nausea was assessed in many studies, and several contributed 1 or 2 cases to the total number of 58 in probiotics users and 52 across control groups. However, Besselink (2008) reported 20 cases of nausea in the treatment group and 23 in the control group. Respiratory infections were assessed in a number of studies, but 47 out of all 58 reported infections in a treatment group , and 49 out of all 59 control group incidences were reported by Gibson (2008), investigating the safety of a probiotic infant formula. The 52 cases of \"spitting up \" in participants taking probiotics compared to 45 control group cases were almost all reported in a st udy by Abrahamsson (2007) (2 control group c ases were reported by Maldonado (2009) investigating a probiotics inte rvention in the prevention of eczema). There were 46 cases of \"dyspepsia\" in the probiotics group across studies and 3 in control group participants. As 45 cases came from one study that did not explicitly report on the control group (Turchet, 2003) , the interp retation of the difference in results has to be regarded with caution. The adverse event with the next highest incidence was that of \" constipation \" (76 cases vs. 71 cases among control). In all, 44 cases of \"abdominal discomfort\" were reported across probiotics intervention groups (compared to the same number in a control group) where the number of adverse events was clearly stated. The symptom was assessed in a number of studies but the cases primarily came from one study (Kukkonen, 2007) that evaluated a synbiotic infant formula (35 cases in treatment, 37 in control group). 31 Colic was assessed in a number of studies , but 17 out of the 38 treatment group cases and 15 out of all 33 incidences of colic in control group infants were reported in Vlieger (2009), who investigated the tolerance and safety of a probiotic infant formula. There were 36 recorded incidences of abdominal fullness in a probiotics intervention group and 43 incidences across the control groups, all reported in one study (Besselink, 2008). All 35 cases of 'allergy sensitization' in the treatment group compared to 21 cases in the control group were identified in a failed effectiv eness study (Taylor, 2007) that investigated the role of probiotic infant formula in the prevention of atopic dermatitis. The 31 cases of pain on micturition compared to 42 control group incidences were reported by Naito (2008) investigating adverse events in patients with transurethral resection of bladder cancer. All other events occurred in fewer than 30 participants across the 2 91 trials; all individual study results are shown in the Evidence Ta ble C4 , Results. Number of Adverse Events To quantify the risk of adverse events, we extracted two measures from individual studies, the number of participants with adverse events and the number of incidences of adverse events. This review included studies in generally healthy as well as critically ill pa rticipants with multiple morbidities. The listed adverse events are primarily of interest only in relation to a control group. Only controlled studies allow a comparison of the natural occurring rate of adverse events , the rate that can be expected with patients suffering from a particular condition , or that are caused by cointerventions. Number of participants with adverse events. For each included study, we extracted the number of participants who experienced an adverse event in each group , where available. There were 121 studies that reported this number for a group with probiotics intake and a control group not receiving probiotic organisms as part of the intervention. The pooled relative risk effect for the number of adverse events was 0.98 (95% confidence interval [ CI]: 0.93, 1.04, p=0.537) indicating that the risk to experience any adverse event was not higher in the probiotic group than in a control group not taking probiotics. The pooled risk 0.005, 0.003, p=0.993), indicating no difference between treatment and control groups. The included controlled trials used a variety of control interventions. For comparisons between treatment groups , we considered all control interventions that were characterized by the absence of probiotics use. In a further sensitivity analysis, we restricted the comparison to parallel placebo -controlled RCTs. There was also no indication of an increased risk of adverse events relative to placebo control group participants ( relative risk [ RR]: . Not all studies reported explicitly the total number of participants who experienced an y adverse event in each treatment group. The majority of studies reported one or more instances of adverse events that occurred in each group. From the publication it was not always clear whether these events were the only adverse events encountered and how many participants experienced an adverse event, as a participant can experience more than one adverse event . An alternative way to approach the risk for adverse events is to synthesize across all mentioned adverse event incidences. Studies where the total number of adverse event incidences exceeded the number of participants were excluded from this analysis , but 208 studies entered the analys es. The pooled relative risk for probiotics groups relative to control groups was 1.00 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.07, p=0.999) in this analysis, indicating a n 32 equal risk of adverse events in the intervention group and the control group. T he risk difference between intervention and control groups was 0.002 (95% CI: -0.002, 0.007, p=0.303). T he small difference statistically significant; despite the large number of RCTs , no difference across treatment arms in the quantity of adverse events could be observed. Considering only parallel placebo -controlled trials , there was also no evidence for a statistically significantly increased risk of adverse events based on the number of adverse event incidences only the total number of adverse events reported in the main treatment group and the main control group, regardless of the type of outcome, including mild side effects such as bloating as well as serious adverse events such as sepsis and death . In section 2c we explore the nature of reported ad verse events further , and Key Question 5 summarizes the evidence on serious adverse events. A detailed analysis of the genera -specific safety reported in controlled trials is provided in Key Question 3b, additional intervention factors are also explored in Key Question 3. Long-T erm Effects Of all included controlled trials , six addressed long- term effects of probiotics intake , meaning the studies reported followup assessments of one year or more. All investigated Lactobacillus strain interventions, alone or in combination with Bifidobacterium . Abrahamsson (2007) investigated a short prenatal exposure and then 1 year of intake of probiotic organisms ( Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 55730) in infants to prevent eczema and fo und no differences in gastrointestinal problems between groups (spitting up, colic, or constipation), the last followup was at two years, one year after the original treatment had stopped , and no other adverse events were reported . Kopp (2008) investigated a short prenatal exposure and then six months of probiotics intake ( Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG ATCC 53103) in infants to prevent atopic dermatitis and pointed out that children with recurrent episodes of wheezing bronchitis were more frequent in the probiotics treatment group (13 vs. 4 cases, p=0.03) at the 2\u00ad year followup, 1.5 years after the original treatment had stopped; the authors reported that no other notable adverse effects attributable to the probiotics supplementation were observed. Kuitunen (2009) (see also Kukkonen, 2007) investi gated a short prenatal exposure and then 6 months of probiotics intake ( Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG ATCC -55 103) in infants to prevent allergic diseases and found similar rates of abdominal discomfort, vomiting, excessive crying, and difficulty swallowing the product across groups , but infants in the probiotic group had significantly lower hemoglobin values than the placebo group. T he followup period was 2 years; the last followup was 1.5 years after the intervention had stopped. Ljungberg (2006) followed children with genetic risk for type 1 diabetes mellitus for two years to evaluate the feasibility of using Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in the first 6 months of life to decrease the appearance of Type 1 diabetes -associated autoantibodies. A t the 2-year followup, the study found two sample s positive for autoantibodies (3 across all followup periods), but the treatment group allocation was not specified , and other adverse event results were not reported. Naito (2008) investigated a 1\u00ad year probiotic supplementation ( Lactobacillus casei Shirota) of participants on chemotherapy and reported no statistically significant differences between pain on micturition, urinary frequency, gross hematuria, constipation, or diarrhea across groups in the 3- year followup period, 2 years after the intervention stopped. Niers (2009) investigated a short prenatal exposure and then 1 year of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus intake of mothers and their high-risk children to prevent allergic disease and 33 followed these dyads for 2 years. The flow diagram shows that the rate of dropouts for health problems of the child or the mother, feeding difficulties, or gastrointe stinal colic were similar across groups. No other trials were identified that reported on long- term effects of probiotics. The effect s of long-term use of probiotics (defined as intervention durations of 1 year or more) are described in Key Question 4a. (1c) What harms are reported in case reports? In total, 43 case studies were identified that reported 1 case 2005), 4 cases (Hennequin, 2000; Richard, 1988) or 6 cases (Lherm, 2002) of individuals who experienced an adverse event potentially associated with administered probiotic organism s. Only patients reported to have taken probiotic organisms purposefully (intervention study criterion) were eligible for inclusion in the review; hence, Perapoch et al. (2000) and Piarroux et al. (1999) contributed only one case each to the evidence tables, Munoz (2005) three cases , and Lherm (2002) six out of seven discussed cases. The identified case studies reported on 62 cases in total. The participant details are abstracted in Evidence Table C1 , Study and Participant Detail ; the product details are abstracted in Evidence Table C2 , Intervention. We extracted details for all included case studies that reported adverse events. We extracted the exact reported adverse event (s) and classified them using the CTCAE classification system. Although the reporting o f adverse events tended to be more detailed in case studies , it was nonetheless rarely possible to grade the severity of the individual symptoms. The adverse events are shown in Evidence Table C4, Results. The safety of probiotics was the main aim of all i ncluded case studies; the topic was an adverse event potentially associated with the intake of probiotic organisms . The case reports considered the adverse event to have potentially been caused by the intake of probiotic organisms. The majority of publications presented the finding as a rare event of clinical importance encountered in clinical practice were identifi ed by following up a particular infection and then investigating whether it might be linked to exposure to probiotics. Lherm (2002) describe seven cases of fungemia in an intensive care unit, 6 of which could be linked to pretreatment with Saccharomyces boulardii [cerevisiae]. Munoz (2005) observed three patients with Saccharomyces cerevisiae fungemia in an intensive care unit for whom a review of the medical 34 record s identified the treatment with Ultralev ura as a risk factor. Piarroux (1999) retrospectively analy zed case histories of 437 observed cases of fungemia and concluded that Saccharomyces accounted for 16 cases. The authors described a Saccharomyces boulardii [cerevisiae] intervention for one patient but provided no further details on the other cases. Rich ard (1988) followed up all encountered cases of bacteremia caused by a Bacillus strain in a 6-year period and concluded that four of eight cases of Bacillus subtilis bacteremia were associated with the absorption of an oral preparation containing Bacillus subtilis spores. The most commonly reported single outcome in the case studies was fungemia. Fungemia or presence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae /boulardii in blood cultures was reported for 33 in 21 publications cation reported the spread of fungemia to another infant who had not consumed probiotic organisms (Perapoch, 2000). All studies reported that the infection was associated with the administered organism Saccharomyces boulardii [cerevisiae]; however more details on the reliability and valid ity of the recovery methods are given in section 1h. Eight c ases of bacteremia associated Lactobacillus casei , Lactobacillus GG , and Bacillus subtilis were reported six publications 2001; De Groote, 2005; Ledoux, 2006; Richard, 1988; Tommasi, 2008). Sepsis was reported for nine cases described in seven publications with the intake of Saccharomyces boulardii [cerevisiae], Lactobacillus GG, Bacillus blend of Bifidobac terium and Lactobacillus strains , but more details are reported in section 1h. D-lactic acidosis was reportedly associated with Lactobacillus acidophilus in one case, a blend of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis in one other, and a Munakata, 2010; Oh, 1979). Endocarditis was reported in two publications reporting on two total cases (Mackay, 1999; Presterl, 2001), associated with a blend of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus strains . The development of an abscess associated with Lactobacillus rhamnosus was reported in two publications describing one case each (Conen, 2009; Rautio, 1999). Fever as the main adverse event after Saccharomyces boulardii [cerevisiae] use was described in one publication describing one patient (Jensen, 1976). One case of food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome was associated with a Saccharomyces boulardii [cerevisiae] intervention (Hwang, 2009). Kniehl et al. (2003) reported 3 cases of diarrhea in patients who took a Bacillus product, but concluded that probiotics medication may result in diagnostically misleading results when stool specimen s are taken (pseudo-outbreak of Bacillus cereus ). Twelve of the 59 patients described above died : 1 patient due to neurological complications (Richard, 1988), 1 due to pulmonary infection (Richard, 1988), 1 due to c omplications of anorexia nervosa (Cherifi, 2004), 1 due to multiple organ failure after bypass operation (Lestin, 2003), 2 presumably primarily sepsis related (Oggioni, 1998; Rijnders, 2000), and 6 patients due to causes not further specified (Lherm, 2002; Munoz, 2005). 35 Long-T erm Effects Three studies reported on the clinical course of the pr esented case studies and followed the patient for 1 year or more . Oh (1979) reported on an incidence of d- lactic acidosis in a patient with short-bowel syndrome taking Lactobacillus acidophilus . After treatment with neomycin, the patient remained free of acidosis and neurologic dysfunction in the reported 1- year followup period. Presterl (2001) reported on a case of endocarditis initially associated with the intake of Lactobacillus rhamnosus after possible long-term consumption of probiotic yogurt (exact duration not reported , DNA- based m ethods showed no match of organisms) . After treatment with penicillin for the infection and other medical procedures for further morbidities, the patient was well at the 3-, 6-, and 12-month checkups. Cesaro (2000) reported on a case of Saccharomyces cerevisiae fungemia in a neutropenic patient. After treatment with amphotericin -B, bone marrow transplantation, and chemotherapy to treat leukemia, the patient was well at least 3 years after the fungemia incidence. (1d) What safety parameters are collected in population surveillance studies and other observational studies, and do these include only standard clinical safety parameters ( e.g., standard blood chemistry profiles) or also expanded laboratory or clinical testi ng unique to the use of probiotics? None of the included studies in this review is a traditional population surveillance study. None of the screened studies followed participants who chose to take probiotics or synbiotics, and hence would have been a self -selected intervention group. With the exception of some case studies, all of the included studies were part of a research study investigating the effects of probiotics or synbiotics chosen by the study investigators. We identified no cohort study comparin g a group of participants who us ed probiotics with a group of people who did not. We also did not identify case- control studies that met all our inclusion criteria, that is, studies that identify cases by the outcome and look for potential risk factors, of which taking probiotics might be one. Hence there is no evidence from traditional population surveillance studies. We identified 53 case series, studies that follow ed a group of participants who w ere given probiotics or synbiotics. Case series do not compare the results of the treatment sample to a control group, so this evidence is typically classified as observational and limited in its power to allow inferences from observed adverse events to the received intervention. Two thirds of the identified studies used medium sample size s. Only 8 large studies (reporting on 100 or more participants) were identified on 10 or fewer participants (Benchimol, 2004; Weiss, Nineteen of the case series indicated that i nvestigatin g the safety of the intervention was one of the main aims of the publication (Bibiloni, However, almost half of the case series did not report that they assessed adverse events as part of their treatment evaluation , as can be seen in Evidence Table C3, Assessment. 36 Where studies stated that adverse events were monitored, they typically did not define what would be considered an adverse event and what exactly was monitored. Where specified, studies mentioned that they monitored gastrointestinal symptoms or blood chemistry results. To assess any adverse events that may occur during the treatment period, some studies used a patient diary n most cases , the assessment was done by a health care professional . It was often not clear whether the assessment of adverse events was prompted or whether the health care professionals recorded only adverse event s that participants chose to mention. Colechia (2006) reported the use of a published questionnaire (Neri, 2000) for the harms assessment. The measure was designed to discriminate irritable bowel syndrome and gastrointestinal diseases from food allergies; however it also covered drug tolerance. Mego (2005 and 2006) graded toxicity according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 2.0), designed to report results of cancer treatment. We also extracted which adverse events were reported on by the authors, regardless of whether the harm occurred or it was reported that no incidence of the harm was found. Th e most frequently recorded individual adverse event was diarrhea or watery stool (recorded in nine studies); gas studies); and nausea ( six st udies). (1e) What harms are reported in population surveillance studies and other observational studies? As described under Key Question 1d, we did not identify conventional population surveillance studies that met our inclusion criteria. The only evidenc e that can be described here stems from case series. In this review, a c ase series was defined as a study reporting on a single group of participants using probiotics or synbiotics. In total, 53 case series were identified reporting on 3,473 participants. The majority investigated Lactobacillus strain interventions, mainly alone or in some cases in combination with strains of other genera. Five studies investigated an intervention including Bifidobacterium , Saccharomyces , three Enterococcus , , and two Bacillus organisms. All included genera are indicated in the Evidence Table C4 , Results, details of the individual interventions are shown in Evidence Table C2 , Intervention. For all case series , we extracted which adverse events were reported in the publication, using the exact wording from the articles. In addition we classified the adverse events using the CTCAE classification system and graded events where possible; however the reported detail of adverse events rarely permitted gra ding the severity. We also indicated for each outcome whether it was considered an SAE. The details of each study can be seen in Evidence Table C4 , Results. The most frequent ly reported incidence of an individual symptom across the case series was bloating or fullness (25 participants, recorded in 7 studies) followed by diarrhea or watery stools (22 participants across studies, 16 studies recorded the outcome). F latulence or gas ( 20 participants , 9 studies recorded the outcome) and n ausea ( 18 participants , recorded in 13 studies) were also recorded in more than 10 participants. In total, the case series reported 12 deaths acro ss studies, and the outcome was recorded in 3 studies. During the study reported by Carlsson (2009), two dementia patients using Lactobacillus and Lactococcus among other medications di ed. Malkov (2006) report ing on a sample of 10 37 cancer patients using, among other medication, a Bacillus oligonitrophilus KU-1 containing product, all of whom died from unspecified causes, liver failure, pulmonary edema , and stroke. Mego (2006) reported that no deaths occurred (Enterococcus faecium M-74 containing intervention). In the absence of a control group and multiple alternative explanations for the reported adverse events , it is not possible to attribute the events to the probiotics intervention. Long-T erm Effects None of the included case series reported on long- term treatment effects (a followup of 1 or more years after the administration of probiotic organisms). (1f) What harms are reported in human mechanistic studies? Of the included studies that reported a specific a dverse event , none could clearly be described as a mechanistic study. Studies primarily investigating possible mechanisms of action of probiotics are either not published in the peer- reviewed literature and databases we searched , which concentrated on heal th research , or they do not consider patient health outcomes, the focus of this review. We also identified only a very small number of studies that report ed nonspecific safety statements and that could be described as mechanistic studies (see Appendix C, E vidence Table C6, Nonspecific Safety Statements). A study focusing in part on a mechanistic question (Garrido, 2005) investigated how the ingestion of different amounts of Lactobacillus johnsonii La1 influences the main bacterial populations of the fecal microbiota in eight symptomatic volunteers. The study stated that the participants showed good tolerance for the product and noted only mild increases of borborygmi. Johansson (1998) investigated the survival of Lactobacillus plantarum DSM 9843 (299v) after ingestion in a RCT and reported that five participants in the probiotic and (the rose-hip drink) control group experienced transient abdominal discomfort, nausea, or flulik e symptoms. Songisepp (2005) studied the fecal lactoflora composition, Lactobacillus fermentum ME-3 recovery, intestinal lactoflora, and oxidative stress markers of blood in healthy volunteers and reported one acute respiratory viral infection (treatment group unclear) and no changes in gastrointestinal functions or other adverse e ffects on general welfare. A case series by Biblioni (2005) that investigated the composition of biopsy- associated microbiota in patients with ulcerative colitis among other questions reported that no b iochemical adverse events occurred with VSL#3, but 29 percent of participants reported increased bloating. Satokari (2001) published an additional article on polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel ele ctrophoresis monitoring of fecal Bifidobacterium populations in a prebiotic and probiotic trial, and reported one incident of abdominal discomfort in the control group and one control group participant who did not complete the study due to antibiotic treat ment. (1g) Do the studies describe an antibiotic therapy designed to treat unintended pathology caused by the administered organism? Of the 387 included studies, 40 case studies (of all 43 case studies) describe d an antibiotic or antifungal therapy design ed to treat unintended pathology potentially caused by the administered organism the case studies are described in section 1c. None of the other studies (i.e., case series, CCTs, parallel and crossover RCTs) reported the use of antibiotics to treat unintended effects of the probiotics treatment. However, causes for antibiotic or antifunga l therapy were neither always clearly stated nor easy to establish , and authors might not have associated the treatment with the probiotic intervention. Hence, we extracted any mention of antibiotic treatment in the included studies. This summary does not include studies where all participants received antibiotics as a cotreatment or studies where the reduction or prevention of antibiotics use was an efficacy outcome. Only studies were considered that reported that a course of antibiotic or antifungal treatment was required to treat an adverse event of individual participants during or after the intervention period. Two case series reported that a par ticipant required antibiotic treatment during a probiotic intervention. One study reported antibiotic treatment for febrile neutropenia (Mego, 2006) . The other study reported treatment for a case of bronchitis (Reid, 2001). Seventeen RCTs in total reported explicitly that a participant req uired antibiotic treatment during or after the intervention. In none of the RCTs did the authors relate the infections requiring antibiotic treatment to the probiotic , and antibiotic treatment was required in treatment and control group participants. One study reported that participants receiving the probi otic had more otitis media , and it was then treated with an antibiotic (Abrahamsson, 2007). Allen (2010) reported more respiratory infections in the probiotic treatment group compared to placebo, and nine cases across arms were treated with antibiotics. Basu (2007) reported that two participants in each group were treated for septicemia (presumably with antibiotics, although not explicitly stated). Another study reported that two participant s received antibiotics for abscesses that the authors attributed to Crohn's disease, specifically stating that they were \"not caused by LGG ,\" or Lactobacillus GG (Bousvaros, 2005). Gerasimov (2010) reported that three preschool children ( two treatment group and one control group) treated for atopic dermatitis w ere lost to followup due to respiratory tract infections requi ring antibacterial therapy. Two of the RCTs reported unanticipated antibiotic use required during probiotic and placebo treatment but did not specify what it was treating (Chouraqui, 2008; Krasse, 2006). Haschke- Becher (2008 ) reported that one child in a p robiotic intervention and three children in control groups withdrew due to antibiotic intake. One of the RCTs reported a gastrointestinal infection in the probiotics treatment group, without identification of the causative organism (Mimura, 2004). In another study, one case of perineal Candida was found in both arms and was treated with antibiotics (Millar, 1993). Niers (2009) reported that three mother-child pairs out of each treatment group discontinued a trial on prevention of allergic diseases due to use of antibiotics. Satokari (2001) reported that one control group participant did not complete the study because of an antibiotic treatment (details not reported). Sullivan (2003) reported that one participant in the probiotics group developed diarrhea , with no causative organism confirmed and was later treated with antibiotics. T ursi (2006 and 2008) reported that one case in a probiotics group was admitted to a hospital due to acute bronchial pneumonia and treated with antibiotics. Larsson (2008) reported that 10 participants received antibiotics for upper respiratory infections or other reasons, at least 4 of whom were in the probiotic group. De Preter (2006) 39 reported that 1 participant withdrew from a crossover trial comparing Saccharomyces boulardii [cerevisiae], lactulose, and placebo intake but the group to which the participant was a ssign ed was not reported. (1h) Do the studies describe methods for recovery of the administered organism from either the gastrointestinal tract or serum? To be included in the review, studies had to report an adverse patient health outcome; the recovery of the administered organism alone was not a sufficient outcome to be eligible for inclusion in the review. Nonetheless, a large number of included studies reported r mouth , or vagina. In most cases , the attempt to recover the organism was used as an efficacy measure, an indicator of a successful intervention and quality check that the organism was indeed consumed. None of the case series, CCTs, or parallel or crossover RCTs reported an infection or other significant clinical signs and the recovery of the administered organism. Some of the trials reported that infections and/or the recovery of the administered organisms in the blood w ere monitored but that no cases occurred. A description of the methods was not reported ; however, any suspected positive iden tification may have changed that. Evidence From Controlled Trials In total, 36 trials reported that sepsis, bacteremia or fungemia, infections, or blood cultures were monitored to investigate associations with the administered organism as a safety precauti on. A small number of trials reported explicitly on the absence of probiotics- associated sepsis, bacteremia or fungemia. Alberda (2007) reported no cases of Lactobacillus -induced sepsis. Bin- Nun (2005) reported no cases of sepsis due to administered probiotics ( Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus strains) . Forestier (2008) reported no cases of Lactobacillus -related sepsis. Jirapinyo (2002) reported no cases of sepsis due to Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium . Kerac (2009) reported no cases of probiotics- related sepsis (Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, and Pediococcus ). Li (2004) reported no cases of sepsis due to Bifidobacterium . Lin (2005) reported no cases of sepsi s due to probiotics ( Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium ). Lin (2008) reported no cases of sepsis due to probiotics ( Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium ). Manzoni (2006) reported no cases of sepsis due to LGG. Millar (1993) reported no cases of sepsis or infections attributable to LGG. Rouge (2009) reported no cases of sepsis due to Lactobacillus and Bifidob acterium . Barraud (2010) reported no cases of bacteremia due to Lactobacillus . Honeycutt (2007) reported no cases of Lactobacillus bacteremia. Morrow (2010) reported no cases of Lactobacillus bacteremia. Song (2010) reported no cases of fungemia due to Saccharomyces . A small number of trials reported on the absence of probiotic- associated infections or signs of infections. Allen (2010) reported no infections due to Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium . The PROPATRIA trial (Besselink, 2008) reported no infections caused by the administered probiotics ( Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains) . Frohmader (2010) reported infections due to Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium , and Streptococcus strains) . Kotzampassi (2006) reported no cases of infections due to Lactobacillus species contained in formula. Lawrence (2005 ) reported no cases of Lactobacillus infections. Salminen (2004) reported no cases of infections due to Lactobacillus . Awad (2010) reported no probiotic bacteria were found 40 in blood ( Lactobacillus ). Osterlund (2007) reported no cases of Lactobacillus growth in blood. Peral (2009) reported that the administered Lactobacillus organism was not recovered in peripheral blood or wound samples. Samanta (2008 ) reported no blood cultures grew Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium . Wolf (1998) reported that all cultures for bacteria in blood samples showed no growth after seven days of incubation ( Lactobacillus ). Finally, some studies reported on the absence of infectious incidences without reference to the administered probiotic. Anukam (2008) reported no cases of bacteremia ( Lactobacillus and Streptococcus strain intervention). Delia (2007) reported no cases of bacteremia or sepsis (intervention with Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium , and Streptococcus strains) . Kianifar (2009) reported bacteremia or fungemia ( Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium intervention). Luoto (2010) reported no cases of sepsis (Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium intervention). Merenstein (2010) reported no cases of viral infections causing fever in the treatment group (Lactobacillus and Streptococcus strains) . Panigrahi (2008) reported no cases of sepsis (Lactobacillus intervention). Reid (1992) reported no cases of superinfections (Lactobacillus strains) . Saint- Marc (2010 ) reported no cases of infections (Saccharomyces intervention). Songisepp (2005) reported no infections ( Lactobacillus intervention). Wada (2010) reported no cases of bacteremia ( Bifidobacterium intervention). Knight (2007) reviewed whether any deaths in the samples were attributable to probiotic organisms and reported also on colonization of Leuconostoc in tracheal aspirate which may indicate that they also looked for the administered organisms. McFarland (1994) reported no cases of Staphylococcus sepsis, which may indicate that they also looked for the administered organisms. Evidence From Case Series Of the case series, Luoto (2010) reported no cases of LGG sepsis. Mego (2005) reported that the seven cases of bacteremia were mainly caused by coagulase -negative Staphylococcus and concluded that no infection was induced by the tested strain ( Enterococcus faecium M-74). In a second study, Mego (2005) described a test for colonization of the gut by Enterococcus bacteria and in addition stated that bacteremia or infection caused by the tested probiotic strain (Enterococcus faecium M-74) w as not found. Schneider (2005) described stool analyses and reported that no fever or fungemia occurred but did not mention a specific test ( Saccharomy ces boulardii [cerevisiae] intervention. Srinivasan (2006) explicitly stated that cultures did not show a pathologic growth of Lactobacillus bacteria (in surface cultures or sterile body fluids). Evidence From Case Studies Most case studies reported the recovery of an organism that resembled the administered probiotic strain (see Evidence Table C4 , Results) . The years of publication of the case studies encompass almost 40 years, during which time methods of identification have evolved. In several cases , there remained some doubt whether the recovered strain was identical to the administered organism. In most publications , authors suspected that there was an association rather than being able to show conclusively that the administered and the recovered organism were identical . Several case studies did not report on an identification method, used phenotypic identification alone, or used other indicators such as the temporal closeness to the reaction (Burkhardt, 2005; in particular more recent ones, described a genetic fingerprinting approach to match species or strains. Lactobacillus. Conen (2009) reported that Lactobacillus rhamnosus species recovered from an abscess were identical to the intervention species according to not further specified genetic sequencing pattern and resistance testing. De Groote (2005) used sequencing of the ribosomal operon region and strain typing of the isolates with pulsed field gel electrophoresis to show identi ty of the intervention organism and the Lactobacillus rhamnosus blood stream isolates. Kunz (2004) used PFGE to identify Lactobacillus GG from blood culture isolate in a case of sepsis and intervention isolates. Land (2005) used repetitive element sequence- based polymerase chain reaction DNA fingerprinting to match Lactobacillus GG isolates from bacteremia and sepsis cases and the intervention isolate. Rautio (1999) used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to identify Lactobacillus rhamnosus species. Presterl (2001) used randomly amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction (RAPD) -PCR assays to distinguish pathogens and the probiotic strain and concluded that the Lactobacillus rhamnosus isolate causing endocarditis and septic arthritis was not identical with the probiotic yogurt Lactobacillus rhamnosus isolate as initially suspected. Bifidobacterium. Ohishi (2010) used polymerase chain reaction analysis and strain -specific identification by a randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis to confirm the identity of sepsis isolates and the Bifidobacterium breve BBG -01 to match Saccharomyces cerevisiae species seen in fungemia with the intervention species. Fredenucci (1998) used electrophoretic patterns and variations in DNA-band patterns to establish the identity of the administere d Saccharomyces boulardii [cerevisiae] organisms and fungemia isolates. Hennequin (2000) used mitochondrial DNA patterns to compare fungemia isolates and intervention Saccharomyces boulardii [cerevisiae] organisms. Lherm (2002) used a comparison of the polymorphism of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA with 13 restriction enzymes from the Saccharomyces boulardii [cerevisiae] ) isolated in patients and the intervention. Lolis (2008) used sequencing analysis on the DNA of the fungemia strain isolated as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the isolate obtained from the intervention product and reported 98 percent correspondence. Munoz (2005) reported that Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolates were compared in PCR fin gerprinting profiles. Perapoch (2000) used molecular identification based on mitochondrial DNA restriction analysis and chromosomal DNA profiles to show that Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolates were identical. Piarroux (1999) used DNA sequences Streptococcus. No case studies associated with Streptococcus strains used as probiotics were identified. Enterococcus . No case studies associated with Enterococcus strains used as probiotics were identified. 42 Bacillus . Oggioni (1998) used randomly amplified polymorphic DNA technique for two Bacillus subtilis strains . Summary and Strength of Evidence Key Question 1 What is the evidence that the active ( e.g., live or viable) and lyophilized forms of Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus , and Bacillus ) as single ingredients or in combination with other probiotics or prebiotics in all delivery vehicles (and formulations) when used to cure, treat, mitigate or prevent a disease or reduce disease risk are safe in the short term? Long term? Volume : 387 studies Risk of bias : Medium The evidence to answer this Key Question stem s from a variety of study designs and quality. Although a large number of RCTs have been identified , the majority wa s not designed to systematically assess safety outcomes. Consistency: Inconsistent The RCTs, CCTs , and case series show very different results from case studies. Directness: Direct The evidence base includes a large number of RCTs directly comparing inte rvention and control group participants. Precision: Imprecise The majority of included studies use a moderate sample size; very few large studies have been identified. The studies are not powered to detect differences in adverse event incidences. The identified evidence is insufficient to answer the Key Question with confidence. The current literature is not sufficient to allow statements on the safety of probiotics in research studies if the term \"probiotics\" comprises the Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus , and Bacillus . The currently available literature describes primarily Lactobacillus interventions, alone or in combination with other genera, most often Bifidobacterium , and some interventions use Saccharomyces organisms. The available literature includes only a few reports on the genera Streptococcus, Enterococcus , and Bacillus . The absence of case reports of serious adverse events potentially caused by products containing Streptococcus or Enterococcus strains cannot be used as an indicator that the risk of serious adverse events is absent: the overall identified body of literature reporting on the presence and absence of harms indicates absence of relevant literature. The microorganisms have not been used in research studies , which may indicate less use in clinical practice. Few studies indicated what adverse events were monitored. The clinical studies such as controlled clinical trials, and parallel and crossover randomized controlled trials and observational case series that reported on monitoring of adverse events listed gastrointestinal adverse events such as diarrhea, vomiting, and constipation as explicitly monitored. Individual outcomes that were often reported on were death, diarrhea, constipation, and nausea, seemingly equally frequent across treatment arms. Individual outcomes such as mortality 43 and allergy sensitization should be assessed in a risk-benefit analysis including the outcome regardless of whether it was investigated as a safety concern or efficacy measure according to reports of failed effectiveness. We have identified a number of case studies reporting cases of fungemia and some bacteremia cases that are likely to have been caused by the administered probiotic strain. The number of cas es is small considering the volume of the literature searched ; however, the studies indicate that probiotic strains can be associated with serious adverse event s and that they can be linked to the use of probiotic products. To quantify the risk, study desi gns other than case studies are needed (e.g., RCTs). Even though the risk potential has been documented in the literature, studies do not routinely state that they assessed the risk of infections caused by the administered strain. None of the identified case series, CCT s, or crossover and parallel RCTs reported an infection caused by the administered probiotic strain. In the absence of a control group and multiple alternative explanations for the adverse events reported in case series , it is not possible to attribute the events to the probiotics intervention. Across RCTs , there was no evidence for a statistically significantly increased relative risk of the quantity of adverse events for intervention participants compared to control based on two alternative measures: the number of participants with adverse events per treatment arm (RR 0.98; 95% CI: 0.93, 1.04; p=0.537) and the (RR 1.00; CI: 0.93, 107; p=0.999) in short and medium followup studies. The review did not identify comparative population surveillance studies that systematically assessed safety. Very few publications were identified that reported on long- term effects of probiotics use. Key Question 2. What are characteristics and association s of the reported harms in Question 1? All 387 studies meeting criteria for full data abstraction were considered to answer Key Question 2. The overview presented at the beginning of this chapter and Key Question 1 show the literature is incomplete with regard to the assessment of adverse events potentially associated with probiotics interventions . The evaluation of the characteristics and associations is limited to adverse events as currently reported in research studies. (2a) What interactions between probiotics and medications are reported? None of the included studies reported a formal interaction analysis for safety data. A number of studies commented on interaction effects for efficacy outcomes, but none of the studies investigated statistically whether medication leads to differential safety results For the purpose of this review, we recorded whether participants in included studies used antibiotics, corticosteroids, immune suppressants, dietary therapies, or other pertinent cotreatment s (e.g., che motherapy) that m ight possibly influence the adverse events experienced by participants. We found a large number of parallel RCTs where participants systematically used additional treatments apart from the probiotics preparation under review. To address the question of an interaction between probiotics and medications, we differentiated RCTs broadly into those that reported a pertinent cotreatment and those that did not and added this factor to a meta -regression predicting effect size. This analysis compares the risk ratio between intervention and control group participants for studies with cotreatment s and for studies without cotreatment s, and determines whether this difference in risk is statistically significant. 44 Using the number of participants with adverse events , we found that the relative risk to experience an adverse event for studies with cotreatment s was slightly higher but not statistically significantly different from studies without pertinent cotreatment s (RR 1.12; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.26; p=0.074). This interaction analysis is based on 106 RCTs for which data were available for pooling. In total, 44 of these RCTs reported pertinent cotreatments. These numbers are based on the number of participants experiencing an adverse event. Using the total numbe r of events across groups as a sensitivity analysis for the robustness of the result, we find a very similar result: the relative risk for studies with cotreatment s was 1.04 times higher than for studies without cotreatment s (95 % CI: 0.90, 1.20; p=0.627), also indicating no evidence for a statistically significant difference in the relative risk of probiotics for studies with and without cotreatment s. This interaction analysis is based on 195 studies; 86 included cotreatment s. Methodologically it is problem atic trying to identify an interaction signal across studies rather than having information that stems from within studies , so this result has to be interpreted with caution. It is noteworthy that the included case studies that reported harms such as fung emia and bacteremia appear to be primarily in patients with multiple morbidities. Although the concomitant medications were not explicitly listed in all studies, the underlying conditions make it very likely that these patients were taking other medication s (see Evidence Table C1 , Study and Participant Details in the appendix for a description of patients). Whether an interaction between probiotics and medications contributed to the observed adverse events, and whether this interaction exists independent of a possible interaction between the underlying condition and probiotics cannot be determined in case studies. Key Question 6 reports stratified analyses for the individual reported cotreatment s. (2b) What harms related to acquired antibiotic resistance and /or transferability are reported? We included reports of acquired antibiotic resistance as well as antifungal resistance, given that the scope of the review included Saccharomyces strains. However, only studies reporting on patient health outcomes were el igible for inclusion in the review ; hence this Key Question considered antibiotic or antifungal resistance and transferability incidences as a patient health outcome with clinical significance. Reports of laboratory tests showing antibiotic or antifungal resistance of microbial strains in isolation are outside the scope of the review. None of the parallel or crossover RCTs , CCTs, or case series reported an incidence of antibiotic resistance and/or transferability. With regard to monitoring antibiotic resis tance or transferability , one RCT (Reid, 1992) explicitly reported that none of the par ticipants with urinary tract infections in a Lactobacillus suppository intervention showed any evidence of super-infection. Antibiotic or antifungal resistance was addressed i n six case reports . Conen (2009) report that Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains recovered from an abscess were resistant to cephalosporin classes I through IV and carbapenems but the patient improved with imipenem, clindamycin , and fluconazole. Oggioni (1998) describe an immunocompromised patient with recurrent septicemia. The patient's condition deteriorated despite antibiotic therapy. Bacillus subtilis strains isolated during fever episodes showed resistance to penicillin, erythromycin, rifampin, and novobiocin in two samples . Ohishi (2010) describe a neonate with omphalocele who developed Bifidobacterium septicemia. The isolated strain was susceptible in vitro to penicillin and ampicillin sulbactam but not to meropenem or amikacin. Piechno (2007) described a case of 45 fungemia in a cancer patient ; one of the blood cultures show ed the presence of Saccharomyces boulardii [cerevisiae] and indicated resist ance to amphotericin B and possibly fluconazole. The patient recovered after a course of voriconazole. Trautman n (2008) report ed on an intensive care patient who developed fungemia and presented with fever after initial clinical improvement while on fluconazole . The patient was able to leave the intensive care unit after administration of caspofungin. Zein (2008) reported on a diabetic patient who developed Lactobacillus rhamnosus septicemia; an antibiogram indicated resistance to nalidixic acid, vancomycin, and teicoplanin. The patient recovered after amoxicillin treatment. (2c) What is the nature of harms, and do these include only standard harms or also harms that might be uniquely applicable to the use of a probiotic? Key Question 1 addressed primarily the quantity of adverse events and specific harms that were monitored and / or reported. The a dverse events repo rted in the included studies were found within many organ systems. To explore the nature of the adverse events , we used the CTCAE system to differentiate adverse events and added an additional category , 'other,' so that all harms could be classified. The categorization system can be seen in Appendix B ( data extraction form ). By far the most commonly reported incidence across all included studies was a gastrointestinal symptom (category VII in the Evidence Table C4, Results) , followed by the category Infect ions and I nfestations (category XI) , and the \"other\" category (category XXVII). The last category included deaths not further specified, unclear adverse event s (e.g., \" collapse, \" \"general health problems\" ), and summary incidences (\"ear, nose, throat symptoms \"). The graph shows the distribution of adverse events within the categories for all probiotic intervention arms (up to three per study) across studies and study designs. For studies that included a control group, frequencies are also shown. Figure 10 shows data from all included studies, both controlled and uncontrolled. 46 Figure 10. Adverse events per CTCAE category for participants using probiotics and control participants (up to 3 probiotics intervention groups, 1 control group 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 Tx Con The categories VII (Gastrointestinal disorders ), XI (Infections and infestations); and also XXVII ( Other ) are the most common categories describing the observed adverse event s. Some encountered adverse events were included in categories X (Investigations), XX (Renal and urinar y disorders); XXII (Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders) , and XXIII (Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders). The other categories (Blood and lymphatic system disorders; Cardiac disorders; Congenital, disorders; disorders; General and administration site conditions; Hepatobiliary disorders; Immune system disorders; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications; Metabolism and nutrition disorders; Musculoskeleta l and connective tissue disorders; Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts polyps); system disorders; Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions; Psychiatric disorders; Reproductive system and breast disorders; Social c ircumstances; Surgical and medical procedures; and Vascular disorders) rarely described the reported adverse event s. The following sections report the risk of adverse events separately for each of the three established domains (gastrointestinal, infections , and 'other' ). The 'other' category was analyzed together with all other observed incidences, excluding only categor ies VII and XI. Gastrointestinal Adverse Events To investigate the relative risk for a gastrointestinal adverse event to occur, we pooled t he parallel RCTs that reported on the presence or the absence of these adverse events . The risk for participants in probiotics intervention groups, relative to non-probiotics control group participants , was 1.03 (95% CI: 0.89, 1.18, p=0.693) indicating that the probiotic interventions were not associated with a statistically significantly increased risk of gastrointestinal adverse events. Overall, there was no evidence across the included RCTs for a statistically significantly 47 increased risk to experience a gastrointestinal symptom in the probiotic group compared to another group from the same pa rticipant population with similar co -interventions and the presence or absence of underlying diseases . The control groups either received a placebo , no treatment, or the co -medication or infant formula without the probiotic supplement. The analysis was based on 126 parallel RCTs. Studies comparing two probiotic or synbiotic treatments were excluded from this analysis and only one probiotic group was selected per stud y so that each study entered the meta- analysis only once (the main treatment group, most similar to the control group apart from the probiotic addition). This analysis included 104 studies that use Lactobacillus strains alone or in combination, indicating that Lactobacillus organisms were most commonly used in the included RCTs. Figure 11 graphically represents individual and pooled point estimates and 95% CIs obtained in included RCTs. Due to the large number of studies, numerical estimates and study identifiers of individual RCTs could not be displayed. 48 Figure 11. Graphical representation of the RR of the number of gastrointestinal adverse events across RCTs 49 The forest plot demonstrates that individual results differed across studies, sometimes favori ng the control group and sometimes the intervention group, with no clear trend in either direction. Confidence intervals were wide in the large majority of studies, and very few individual studies reported a statistically significant difference between int ervention and control group participants. The pooled risk difference between groups for gastrointestinal adverse events was 0.006 (95% CI: -0.001 0.012, p=0.071). The small difference between intervention and control group participant incidences was not statistically significant at the 5 percent level . All individual study results are shown in the Evidence Table C4, Results. Stratified analyses for individual genera, participant characteristics or other intervention characteristics are reported in the following sections. Infections and Infestations We also pooled all incidences of infections and infestations (CTCAE category XI) across the included 65 parallel RCTs that reported the presence or the absence of these adverse event s. The relative risk for indiv iduals in probiotics groups, relative to a control, was 1.00 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.16, p=0.967). Across all included studies, genera, participant groups, and interventions, there was no difference in the risk of experiencing infections and infestations. Figure 12 graphically represents individual and pooled point estimates and 95% CI s obtained in included studies . The numbering on the left hand side of the forest plot indicates the investigated genus. The number 1 indicates that a Lactobacillus strain was part of the intervention. In total, 39 percent of studies investigated blends and most often the blend included a Lactobacillus strain. The number 2 indicates that Bifidobacterium was present without Lactobacillus . Number 3 indicates that Saccharomyces organisms were present without Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium . The number 4 indicates that Streptococcus or Enterococcus were present without Lactobacillus , Bifidobacterium , or Saccharomyces strains. The number 6 indicates that the intervention included Bacillus strains , but no Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococ cus, or Enterococcus strains. Due to the large number of studies, numerical estimates and study identifiers of individual RCTs could not be displayed. 50 Figure 12. Graphical representation of the RR of the number of infection and infestation adverse events across RCTs 51 The forest plot demonstrates that individual results differed across studies, sometimes favoring the control group and sometimes the intervention group, with n o clear trend in either direction. Confidence intervals were wide in the large majority of studies, and no individual study reported a statistically significant difference between intervention and control group participants. Considering the absolute risk d ifference model, the risk difference across treatment and control groups was not detectable (RD 0.000; 95% CI: -0.002, 0.002, p=0.918). There was no indication that reported infections and infestations were more common in probiotics groups compared to a comparable participant sample per group across all included parallel RCTs . All individual study results are shown in the Evidence Table C4, Results. Stratified analyses for individual genera, participant characteristics , or other intervention characteristics are reported in the following sections. Other A dverse Event s The relative risk for individuals in the intervention group compared to the controls was 1.01 (95% CI: 0.91 1.12, p=0.923). In total, 131 RCTs were included in this analysis. The category 'othe r' contains all other adverse event incidences that were not categorized as gastrointestinal in nature or part of the infections and infestations adverse event domain. This category included the number of deaths, when the cause of death was not specified and attributed to a specific organ system . Figure 13 graphically represents individual and pooled point estimates and 95% CI s obtained in included RCTs. In this analysis, the majority of included trials contributing data on other adverse events (107/131) used a Lactobacillus strain alone or in combination with other genera. Due to the large number of included studies, numerical estimates and study identifiers of individual RCTs could not be displayed. 52 Figure 13. Graphical representation of the RR of the num ber of other adverse events across RCTs 53 The forest plot demonstrates that individual results differed across studies, sometimes favoring the control group and sometimes the intervention group, with no clear trend in either direction. Confidence interval s were wide in the large majority of studies , and very few individual studies reported a statistically significant difference between intervention and control group participants. The risk difference to experience any of the other adverse event s (not gastro intestinal or infections) across treatment groups relative to control was 0.001 (95% CI: \u00ad 0.003, 0.004; p=0.713). There was no indication that the adverse event incidences were more frequent in a group using probiotic organism s. All individual study results are shown in the Evidence Table C4, Results. Stratified analyses for individual genera, participant characteristics or other intervention characteristics are reported in the following sections. Evidence pertaining to serious adverse events is documented in Key Question 5. Unique Harms Generally, the identified literature was not very specific with regard to the adverse events that were monitored. The assessment and results evidence table shows, for example, that several studies analyzed blood chemistry variables , but researchers rarely reported exactly what they monitored, and none of the included studies highlighted incidences of unusual or unique results. Harms unique to probiotics were primarily infections attributed to the administered organism. Several case studies reported a DNA -based identification of strains (see section 1c). Of all other included studies, only a few reported explicitly that infections, bacteremia, or sepsis incidences could possibly be attributed to the administered probiotics st rain (see response to Key Question 1h). In the studies that monitored the incidence of infection, none was observed to have been caused by probiotic organisms. Some trials explicitly reported that no incidences of serious infections occurred (see Evidence Table C4 , Results). Other trials reported only the number of incidences of sepsis as an adverse event , and it was not clear whether the administered probiotic strain was considered as a possible cause of the infection. The frequency of reported gastrointes tinal symptoms in the existing literature is noteworthy ; however, neither the quantity nor the quality is unique to probiotics intake; similar symptoms in a similar quantity were also encountered in control groups. Summary and Strength of Evidence Key Ques tion 2 What are characteristics and associations of the reported harms in Question 1? Volume : 387 in total, but varied across subquestions and analyses Risk of bias : Medium The evidence to answer this Key Question stem s from a variety of study designs and quality. Consistency: Inconsistent The RCTs, CCTs, and case series show different results from case studies. Directness: Varies across subquestions The evidence base includes a large number of RCTs . Precision: Precise 54 The majority of included studies use a moderate sample sizes but studies were pooled in a meta -analysis . The identified evidence is moderate to low with regard to being able to answer the Key Question with confidence. As described, the interventions and adverse events are not well documented and studies were not designed to assess adverse events systematically. The majority of studies investigated Lactobacillus interventions, alone or in combination with other genera, most often Bifidobacterium . Studies rarely reported efforts to monitor adverse events specific to probiotic products. Hence, evaluations of the safety might change with future, more targeted, assessment of adverse events. Across all included studies, by far the most commonly reported adverse events were gastrointestinal in nature, followed by reported infections and infestations. The third most common category was the \"other\" category for symptoms that could not be assigned to one of the organ systems outlined in the applied CTCAE system . While the case studies primarily repor ted infections suspected or confirmed to be caused by an administered probiotics strain, the majority of other studies report ed gastrointestinal incidences. Across identified RCTs, there was no indication that participants using probiotic organism s experienced statistically significantly more gastrointestinal adverse events , infections and infestations, or other adverse events compared to control group participants. Individual comparisons were based on a large number of RCTs. There is a lack of individual studies assessing interaction effects of medication affecting adverse events. An indirect comparison of RCTs in participants with pertinent co -medication s compared to studies not describing these comedications indicated a slightly increased , but not statistically significantly differen t, relative risk ratio of adverse event s between treatment and control group participants. We identified only a very small number of studies addressing acquired antibiotic resistance as a patient outcome with clinical relevanc e. Evidence for potential harms came from case studies in patients with multiple morbidities. Resistance was reported only to selected antibiotics . Adverse events other than infections potentially caused by the administered probiotics strain and unique to probiotics were not addressed in the literature . Evidence for infections came from case studies; included trials did not report on this outcome and/or did not find any cases and did not highlight adverse events unique to probiotics use. Key Question 3. What is the evidence that harms of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus , and Bacillus differ by product and delivery characteristics? Very few studies were identified that explicitly investigated the effects of a commercially available food product (see Evidence Table C2 , Intervention) . The majority of identified studies appeared to provide a probiotic intervention prepared especially for the particular research study to investigate a beneficial health effect in par ticipants with moderate health impairments . Most included studies investigated Lactobacillus and/ or Bifidobacterium preparations. In particular there were few reports on the genera Enterococcus , and Bacillus . The reporting of the interventions was insufficient. A large number of studies did not report the strain that was investigated. The lack of reporting is a safety concern. 55 (3a) What is the scientific evidence that harms differ by delivery vehicle including excipients or novel delivery vehicles? We extracted the investigated product name where reported in the publication. D ifferent products such as Actimel, Culturelle, Infloran, or Yakult were described. However, the majority of studies did not state any product name and reported only the genus, such as Lactobacillus , that was given to participants. By far the most common delivery vehicle was a pill or capsule, used in 101 included studies (see Evidence Table C2 , Intervention). We also identified 29 studies of probiotic organisms in a dairy 2003). Among all identified studies, 29 added probiotic organisms to an infant formula used less common delivery vehicles such as vaginal suppositories; powder, often to be dissolved in water; chewing gum ; drops; spray; or cultures on gauze pads as the Evidence Table C2 , Intervention shows. Whe re available, we extracted the information on the delivery vehicle, such as whether the preparation was diluted with water or juice (Champagne, 2005) or mixed with breast milk (Lin, 2005). However, most studies did not describe exactly how the preparation was taken and whether it varied across participants. Only one study was identified that compared two different delivery vehicles directly (Isolauri, 1991), that is, providing direct evidence on the ef fect of delivery vehicles . In this study, a group of children given a Lactobacillus casei GG fermented milk product was compared to a group of children using Lactobacillus GG as a lyophilized powder to promote recovery from acute diarrhea. The study report ed that on day one, 58 percent of children in the milk product group vomited compared to 43 percent in the powder group; on day two, 21 percent versus 22 percent vomited ; on day three, 0 versus 9 percent vomited, and after that , no more vomiting occurred. One other study (Metts, 2003) randomized participants to vaginal suppositories of Lactobacillus acidophilus , suppositories and oral capsules containing Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains, and placebo; one participant in the oral and vaginal suppository group and one in the placebo group reported vaginal discharge. Th ese individual study results do not allow any conclusions regarding the effects of one delivery vehicle over the other. Metaregression : Delivery Vehicle In the absence of direct comparisons, we investigated the delivery vehicle further in a meta \u00ad regression. A metaregression adding the factor \" delivery vehicle \" to a meta- analysis model indicated that adverse events results differ by delivery vehicle based on the number of 56 participants with adverse events (p=0.0157) as well as based on the number of adverse event incidences (p=0.040). The risk ratio between probiotic group participant s and control group participants appeared to vary based on the chose n delivery vehicle. Hence, we investigated individual delivery vehicle further in stratified analyses. Pill/Capsule First, we compared the relative risk seen in a probiotics group using a pill, capsule, or gelcap compared to the risk of adverse events seen in a group a cross the included parallel RCTs. This subgroup represent s the majority of included studies, as this delivery vehicle was most commonly used. We excluded all studies where the vehicle was described as a \" tablet ,\" as it was not clear from the o riginal publication whether this was equivalent to a pill that was meant to be swallowed or a chewable tablet or a tablet that dissolves in water , for example. Compared to controls, participants in a probiotics group were not more likely to experience adverse events , based on the number of participants with adverse p=0.888) in this subgroup of studies using pills, capsules, or gelcaps as the probiotics delivery vehicle. Exploring the nature of the reported adverse events across probiotics and control groups in these studies , there was also no difference in gastrointestinal complaints (RR 1.02; 95 % but no and infestations Secondly, we undertook a stratified analysis for studies that delivered the probiotic organisms in a yogurt or dairy drink. It is conceivable that probiotic organisms react to the delivery vehicle; hence participants in probiotics groups might have an increased risk of adverse events in dairy or yogurt studies. Infant formulas were excluded from this analysis in order not to add another confounder (all infant formula studies have infants as participants). Compared to controls, participants in a probiotics group were not more likely to experience adverse events , based on the number of participants with adverse the number of adverse event incidences in the 24 studies that used this delivery vehicle and reported data, the relative risk was 1.37 (95 % CI: 1.05, 1.79; p=0.022), indicating that participants in the probiotics groups experienced more adverse events than control group participants. The absolute risk difference between studies was 0 .023; it was not statistically significant ( 95% CI: -0.003, 0.049; p=0.078). Exploring the nature of the reported adverse events in this subgroup of studies across probiotics and control groups, there was a trend for more gastrointestinal complaints none of the results showed a 57 statistically significantly increased relative risk or absolute risk difference for adverse events in dairy or yogurt studies comparing treatment to control group participants . There were too few studies to investigate systematic differences between yogurt and dairy studies or to differentiate less common delivery vehicles further in a meta -analysis. Infant formula study results are presented in the response to Key Question 4d in the section on children. Resul ts of all individual studies are shown in the Evidence Table C4, Results. Overall, there was an indication that safety results may differ by delivery vehicle . However, given the type of analysis (an indirect analysis across studies) , this result has to be regarded with caution and cannot replace evidence from direct, within study comparisons. In addition, chosen delivery vehicles can in part be confounded with participant characteristics (e.g. infant formula). (3b) What is the scientific evidence that harms differ by genus, species, and strain (including intraspecies strain variations)? The interventions in the included studies were not well documented. In many cases it was not reported what strains of organisms were used ; only the genera, and sometimes, but not always the species , were stated. To meet inclusion criteria for the review , studies had to report a specific genus contained in the tested intervention. Genus The available research volume differs for the six investigated probiotic agents. A Lactobacillus strain was part of the intervention in 215 (68 percent ) of the included studies, thereby being the most commonly studied genus. This number includes Lactobacillus strains not explicitly used as a probiotic agent but included in the product, for exa mple as a starter culture for yogurt. Bifidobacterium was included in 32 percent of studies. Saccharomyces organisms were investigated in 1 3 percent of studies. Streptococcus strains were included in 15 percent of studies; this number includes studies inve stigating Streptococcus strains explicitly as probiotic agents as well as other uses such as part of a yogurt starter culture. Enterococcus strains were investigated in 16 studies only (5 percent of included studies). Preparations containing Bacillus strains were investigated in 10 studies (3 percent ). With regard to direct comparisons of genera across the included controlled studies, only very few studies were identified that directly compared the effects of two different genera within the study. Cui (2004) compared Bacillus coagulans and Bifidobacterium longum in the treatment of acute and chronic diarrhea and reported that body weight, body temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, routine blood tests, and liver and renal function wer e within normal limits after treatment, and no adverse reactions were found. Dekker (2009) compared the safety of Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 and Bifidobacterium animalis lactis HN019 in a study of infants with asthma, hay fever, or eczema and found a rate of 19.6 percent versus 18.5 percent of hospitalizations in the two groups (17.6 percent for placebo ) and found no statis tically significant differences in gastrointestinal adverse events (diarrhea, reflux, abdominal pain, or vomiting) across groups. De Simone (2001) compared a commercial product containing Streptococcus thermophilus, Bifidobacterium to a product containing Enterococcus faecium in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and found no significant changes in blood counts and chemistry in the groups. Margreiter (2006 ) compared a Lactobacillus gass eri and Bifidobacterium longum intervention with Enterococcus faecium and reported no lab abnormalities in either group. 58 O'Mahony (2005) found no changes in blood counts, serum chemistry, or serum immunoglobulins UCC4331, Bifidobacterium infantis 35624, or placebo. case each of epistaxis, unstable angina , and chest pain due to anxiety , but the group was not specified. Weizman (2005) stated that there was no difference between growth parameters, behavior , or stooling patterns, and there was no difference in the incidence of bloody stools or hospitalization across a Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12, Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 55730, and placebo group. Lactobacillus. Probiotic studies often used Lactobacillus strains in combination with other genera, but we also identified a substantial number of studies using exclusively Lactobacillus strains . The identified case studies describing har ms potentially associated with this genus are described in Key Question 1. To quantify risks, we compared participants in parallel RCTs where one group received a Lactobacillus intervention and the other group received no or nonprobiotic treatment. In para llel RCTs, the relative risk for intervention participants to experience an adverse event was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.11; p=0.785) compared to the nonprobiotic control group, based on all studies that used exclusively Lactobacillus strains and reported the number of participants with adverse events. Figure 14 shows the risk differences observed in individual RCTs . 59 Figure 14. R R number of participants with adverse events Lactobacillus RCTs Individual study results varied, and there was no indication that the number of participants with adverse events differed systematically between groups on a Lactobacillus strain intervention and an equivalent group of control participants. The risk difference was -0.003 (95% CI: -0.014, 0.009; p=0.668). Using the alternative measure, the number of incidences per group, the relative risk was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.88, 1.06; CI: -0.007, 0.011; p=0.746). To explore the nature of adverse events experienced in Lactobacillus exclusive trials , we differentiated gastrointestinal complaints, infections and infestations, and all other reported adverse events. There was no statistically significant difference between intervention and control group in their risk to experience any of the three different types of adverse events (gastrointestinal also investigated the genus Lactobacillus as a factor in a metaregression comparing studies that used Lactobacillus strains (alone or in combination) with interventions that did not. The relative risk ratio across studies did not indicate that the Lactobacillus genus was associated 60 with a statistically significantly increased risk of adverse events compared to other genera based on the number of participants with adverse events (relative risk ratio 1.08; 95% CI 0.95, 1.22; p=0.224). This result was confirmed by the alternative measure of adverse event incidences (relative strains in combination with other genera, and we also identified a few studies using exclusively Bifidobacterium organisms. The identified case study describing harms potentially associated with this genus is described in Key Question 1. Selecting only parallel RCTs that used exclusively Bifidobacterium products, the relative risk based on the number of participants with adverse events was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.82, 1.03; p=0.141) between groups . Figure 15 shows the estimated relative risk reported in each included RCT . Figure 15. RR number of participants with adverse events Bifidobacterium RCTs Individual study results varied, and there was no indication that the number of participants with adverse events differed systematically between a group taking a Bifidobacterium strain and an equivalent control group not taking probiotics. The equivalent risk difference was -0.006 (95% CI: -0.017, 0.004; p=0.228) across all included trials. Using the alternative measure, the number of adverse event incidences, the relative risk was 0.90 (95% CI: -0.74, 1.10; p=0.302) for intervention participants compared to control, with a corresponding risk difference of -0.005 (95% CI:--0.0145, 0.004; p=0.289). To explore the nature of adverse events experienced in exclusively Bifidobacterium trials , we differentiated gastrointestinal complaints, infections and infestations, and all other reported adverse events. There was no statistically significant difference between intervention and control group in their risk to experience any of the three most common types of adverse events (gastrointestinal the genus Bifidobacterium as a factor in a metaregression comparing studies that used Bifidobacterium strains (alone or in combination) with interventions that did not. The relative risk ratio across studies did not indicate that the Bifidobacterium genus was associated with an increased or reduced risk of adverse events co mpared to other genera, based on the number of participants with adverse events (relative risk ratio 1.04; 95% CI 0.93, 1.17; p=0.700). This result was confirmed by the alternative measure of adverse event incidences (relative risk ratio 1.11; We identified a number of case studies describing harms potentially associated with this genus; details are reported in the response to Key Question 1. Selecting o nly parallel RCTs investigating exclusively Saccharomyces interventions, the relative risk of adverse events in the intervention group was 1.00 (95% CI: 0.46, 2.18; p=0.993) compared to control and based on the number of participants with adverse events. The forest plot in Figure 16 shows the results of RCTs that were included in the analysis. Figure 16. RR number of participants with adverse events Saccharomyces RCTs Individual study results varied: Some studies reported no adverse events in either group or an equal number of events; there was no indication that the number of participants with adverse events differed systematically between a group taking a Saccharomyces strain and an equivalent control group not taking probiotics. The risk difference for intervention and control group participants was not detect able (RD 0.000; 95% CI: -0.005, 0.005; p=0.890) in the alternative measure, the number of adverse event incidences per treatment group, the relative risk was 1.15 (95% CI: 0.38, 3.52; p=0.802) , also not statistically significantly different from that of control group participants, and the corresponding risk difference was -0.001 (95% CI: -0.025, 0.024; p=0.956). To explore the nature of adverse events experienced in RCTs using exclusively Saccharomyces organisms, we different iated gastrointestinal complaints, infections and infestations, and all other reported adverse events. There was no statistically significant 62 difference between intervention and control groups in their risk to experience gastrointestinal adverse events ( a trend for more infections and infestations in intervention participants compared to control, but it was not statistically significant across the three studies that reported on infections and infestations (RR 1.69; 95% CI: 0.21, 13.53; p=0.622), 0.000; 95% CI -0.006, 0.006; p=0.919) . There was also no statistically significant difference for all other adverse events ( RR the genus Saccharomyces as a factor in a metaregression comparing studies that used Saccharomyces strains (alone or in combination) with interventions that did not. The relative risk ratio across studies did not indicate that the Saccharomyces genus was associated with a statistically significantly increased risk of adverse events compared to other genera, based on the number of participants with adverse events (relative risk ratio 1.08; 95% CI 0.51, 2.27; p=0.845). This result was confirmed by the alternative measure of adverse event incidences (relative risk ratio 1.57; 95% CI: 0.77, 3.20; p=0.215). Very few studies were identified that studied exclusively Streptococcus strains. Across the parallel RCTs using exclusively Streptococcus strains , the relative risk for adverse events was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.78, 1.25; p=0.907) in the intervention group, compared to an equivalent control group. The forest plot in Figure 17 shows results obtained in individual RCTs . Figure 17. R R number of participants with adverse events Streptococcus RCTs The analysis was based on only three RCTs, the individual study results varied, and there was no indication that the number of participants with adverse events differed systematically between groups taking Streptococcus and control group participants. The corresponding risk difference RCTs the number of adverse event incidences, there was also no statistically significant difference between intervention and control groups (RR 0.90 (95% based on only three RCTs . The results of the individual studies are reported in the Evidence Table C4, Results. We also investigated the genus Streptococcus as a factor in a metaregression comparing studies that used Streptococcus strains (alone or in combination) with interventions that did not. The relative risk ratio across studies did not indicate that the Streptococcus genus was associated with an increased or reduced risk of adverse events compared to other genera, based on the number of participants with adverse events (relative risk ratio 1.03; 95% CI 0.91, 1.17; p=0.624). However , the result using the alternative measure of adverse event incidences indicated that intervention participants were at a greater risk of adverse events compared to other genera (relative risk ratio . Few Enterococcus were identified. The relative risk seen in the Enterococcus arm compared to control was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.47, 1.54; p=0.588) across all studies that reported data. The forest plot in Figure 18 shows the individual results obtained in the included RCTs. Figure 18.

The results of the individual studies are reported in the Evidence Table C4 , Results. We also investigated the genus Enterococcus as a factor in a metaregression comparing studies that used Enterococcus strains (alone or in combination) with interventions that did not. The relative risk ratio across studies did not indicate that the Enterococcus genus was associated 64 with a statistically significantly increased or reduced risk of adverse events compared to other genera, based on the number of participants with adverse eve nts (relative risk ratio 0.88; 95% CI 0.52, 1.51; p=0.507). This finding was confirmed by the alternative measure of adverse event incidences (relative risk ratio 0.79; 95% CI 0.39, 1.60; p=0.507). Bacillus . Few Bacillus studies were identified , as indicated in Figure 19. We included the study described by La Rosa (2003), although the study originally described the investigated organism as Lactobacillus coagulans . The relative risk for intervention participants exposed to Bacillus organisms to experience an adverse event was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.44, 2.22; p=0.973) compared to control and based on the number of par ticipants with adverse events. Figure 19. R R number of participants with adverse events Bacillus RCTs The analysis was based on only three RCTs with an exclusive Bacillus intervention, and individual study results varied. The corresponding risk difference in Bacillus RCTs was -0.014 (95% incidences could not be computed, as only two studies reported the number of individual adverse event incidences for both treatment groups. The only other study that investigated a Bacillus intervention (Cui, 2004) found no adverse reactions in either the Bacillus coagulans group or the control group receiving Bifidobacterium longum . We also investigated the genus Bacillus as a factor in a metaregression comparing studies that used Bacillus strains (alone or in combination) with interventions that did not. The relative risk ratio across studies did not indicate that the Bacillus genus was associated with a statistically significantly different risk of adverse events compared to other genera, based on the number of participants with adverse events (relative risk ratio 0.94; 95% CI 0.44, 2.01; p=0.883). This result was confirmed by the alternative measure of adverse event incidences (relative risk ratio 0.88 95% CI 0.27, 2.92; p=0.841). The indirect comparison of genera across studies did not indicate genera- specific safety results , with the exception of Streptococcus interventions: a metaregression based on the number of adverse incidences indicated a different risk ratio for participant and control group participants compared t o other genera. However, this result was not confirmed based on the alternative measure, the number of participants with adverse events; the risk difference between intervention 65 0.1 1 10 Relative Risk and control groups was not statistically significant ly different ; and only few studies were identified overall that used other genera than Lactobacillus and B ifidobacterium alone or in combination. Finally, direct comparisons within studies are needed to answer this Key Question with confidence. Figure 20 shows the relative risk rat io and confidence intervals for studies using each genus , compared with all other RCTs using other genera in the probiotics interventions. Figure 20. Comparison of adverse events across genera ( RR log scale) The absence of case reports of serious adverse events potentially caused by Streptococcus or Enterococcus (see Key Question 1c) can not be used as an indicat ion that the risk of serious adverse events is absent: The overall identified body of literature reporting on the presence and absence of harms indicates absence of relevant literature. The strains have not been used in research studies , which may indicate less use in clinical practice. Species We identified one study comparing different species within genera. Rosenfeldt (2003) compared Lactobacillus rhamnosus plus Lactobacillus reuteri with containing Lactobacillus 53103 and reported mild, transitory abdominal pain in two participants in the former group ( one par ticipant in the placebo group reported abdominal pain and loose stools). The case studies that used genetic fingerprinting methods to match administered a nd recovered organisms identified species specified as Bacillus subtilis (see Key Question 1). Given the potentially unreliable identification of species actua lly used in the intervention studies, the large number of blends, the differences in dosing, the absence of direct comparisons, and the unsystematic assessment of adverse events across studies , it appears infeasible to draw conclusions regarding species- specific safety in interventions studies. Strains We identified four studies comparing different probiotic strain s. Chouraqui (2008) compared Bifidobacterium longum BL999 Lactobacillus paracasei ST11 and found 7 incidences of noteworthy adverse events in the first 66 group (1 diarrhea, 1 surgery, 3 bronchiolitis, 2 inguinal hernia; n=70) and 4 in the second group (2 vomiting, 1 pyelonephritis, 1 bronchiolitis; n=74). Grach eva (1999) reported one incident of abdominal pain in a group given Bifidobacterium bifidum forte to treat acute intestinal infections, chronic diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, and viral hepatitis B (the parti cipant withdrew) but no incidence in another Bifidobacterium bifidum treatment group. The exact strains were not reported. Higashikawa (2010) compared yogurt containing Lactobacillus plantarum SN35N with yogurt containing Lactobacillus plantarum SN13T and reported no abnormal changes in urinalysis or in serum biochemical parameters in either group. Krasse (2005) compared 2 Lactobacillus reuteri strains (both of human origin but not named) and reported that 1/20 participants in one of the groups experienced increased bowel movement. Some included studies compared groups consuming a yogurt product enriched with probiotic organisms to a control group consuming ordinary yogurt, and the results are documented in the evidence tables, but other comparisons of probiotic species were not found. No other studies made direct comparisons between probiotic products or compared mixtures of genera, species, or strains that would allow insight into the differential adverse event rates of individual species or individual strains. Based on the extremely limited number of studies that directly compared adverse events between probiotic organisms of different species or strains , it is not possible to draw any conclusions regarding the comparative safety of species or strains. Few studies employed a single species or strain ; few studies characterized or verified the exact strain used; and given that microbial strains also mutate relatively quickly , the potential for attributing a particular event to a particular strain, let alone comparing events attributed to particular strains , is limited. (3c) What is the scientific evidence that harms differ between active and lyophilized forms of probiotics? In many studies, the form of the probiotic organism was not described, as can be seen in the Evidence Table C2 , Intervention. We identified 10 studies that compared adverse events between forms of organisms, but these were comparisons of viable and heat- killed strains rather than comparisons between active and lyophilized forms. The direct comparisons did not indicate that adverse events were restricted to or more common in viable preparations. Alberda (2007) compared viable probiotic strains ( Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Streptococcus strains) with bacterial sonicates and reported one case of bowel obstruction and one congestive heart failure death in the viable treatment group. There was one death due to respiratory failure in the sonicates group and one myocardial infarction in the placebo groups. No cases of Lactobacillus induced sepsis occurred in this group of critically ill patients. Awad (2010) compared living and heat- killed LGG preparations to reduce sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates and reported 14 deaths in the heat-killed arm compared to 5 deaths in the viable intervention arm. No cases of probiotic bacteria in blood samples were observed. Horvat (2010) reported one mild wound infection with secretion in the heat-killed group of a synbiotic intervention containing , Pediococcus , and casei GG fermented milk product with Lactobacillus GG as a freeze-dried powder (as described in section 3a, delivery vehicles) and reported no significant difference in vomiting across groups of children recovering from diarrhea. Kirjavainen (2003) randomized infants with atopic eczema and cow's milk allerg y to placebo, viable Lactobacillus GG, or heat- killed Lactobacillus GG. The study was prematurely terminated due to complaints 67 of adverse gastrointestinal symptoms in the heat-killed group. In total, 5/13 children in the heat- killed LGG group reported diar rhea, while none in the viable group or the placebo group reported any adverse events (p=0.05). Merenstein (2009) reported one incidence of emesis in the active and one incidence of constipation in the heat- killed g roup. Rampengan (2010) compared a live and a heat -killed Lactobacillus preparation and reported four versus three adverse events (respiratory or bowel symptoms) in the respective groups. Rayes (2002) compared active and heat-killed Lactobacillus plantarum 299 strains and found 6/31 abdominal side effects in the active group, 11/31 in the heat- killed group and 8/32 in the not enriched enteral nutrition formula group in liver transplant recipients. In a study on patients with major abdominal surgery, Rayes (2002) reported three incidences of abdominal distention, fou r of abdominal cramps, and zero of diarrhea in the active Lactobacillus plantarum 299 group compared to six, five, and zero events in the heat -killed group; the corresponding control group incidences were four, six, and zero. Tsuchiya (2004) compared a synbiotic with (presumably) active Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains with a similar hea t-killed preparation and found no overt clinical or biochemical adverse side effects , but \" a few \" of the irritable bowel syndrome participants presented initially with transient diarrhea -like symptoms (group unclear). Xiao (2003) compared lyophilized and heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus to an active strain and found three cases of vomiting in the active group compared to one case in the heat -killed group. There was one case of constipation and one case of insomnia in the heat-killed group. The authors' descr iptions of the investigated organisms varied to such an extent in the included studies that the data do not seem suitable for an analysis across trials using metaregression or subgroup analyses. In particular , the description of \" active\" may have been used interchangeably with \"viable\" rather than explicitly differentiating active and lyophilized form s. Very few studies indicated that they independently tested the content of the preparation given to participants, either for contaminants or for the viability of the included organisms at the time of the intervention . (3d) Does harm differ by products containing a single probiotic v ersus a mixture of probiotics? The Evidence Table C4 , Results lists the organisms that constituted the intervention for easy reference. Overall, 60 percent of the included studies investigated the effect of only one genus believed to have probiotic properties, while 40 percent investigated the effect of a mixture of organisms, for example using a product that contained Lactobacillus and Bifidobac terium strains . Only two studies were identified that compared a single probiotic with a mixture of probiotic organisms directly . As described previously, De Simone (2001) compared a commercial product including several Streptococcus, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus strains to treatment with Enterococcus faecium and found no significant changes in blood counts and chemistry across groups. Margreiter (2006 ) compared results of Lactobacillus gasseri plus Bifidobacterium longum treatment with the results of a group receiving Enterococcus faecium and reported no adverse event s or clinically relevant abnormalities in labora tory characteristics. One other study (Metts, 2003) randomized participants to vaginal suppositories of Lactobacillus acidophilus , suppositories and oral capsules containing Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains, and placebo; one participant in the oral and vaginal suppository group and one in the placebo group reported vaginal discharge. Kim (2006) compared interventions with 5, 6, and 12 probiotic species and reported that one participant with pre-existing hypertension had elevated blood pressure, loose stool, diarrhea, and dehydration in the 12- species treatment group, one participant 68 each in the 5- and the 6- species group s reported loose stool, diarrhea, and worsening of gastrointestinal symptoms. In the absence of further direct comparisons, we compared the included trials indirectly in subgroup analyses and a metaregression. Single Probiotic Strain Interventions A stratified analysis for studies using only one probiotic strain indicated a somewhat reduced, although not statistically significant, relative risk of adverse events compared to control (0.94; 95% CI: 0.86, 1.03; p=0.171) based on the number of pa rticipants with adverse events. The corresponding risk difference between intervention and control group participants was -0.001 (95% CI: -0.006, 0.003; p=0.557). Using the alternative measure, the number of adverse event incidences showed a similar result, a relative ri sk of for also explored the nature of the adverse events encountered in single- strain studies and found no statistically significant diff erences in the relative or absolute risk for any of the adverse event groups (gastrointestinal intervention and control group participants. Multiple Probiotic Strains Interventions Across studies with m ultiple probiotic strains, the relative risk for the number of participants with adverse events was slightly higher compared to the result observed for single probiotic strains but it was not different from the risk for control group participants (RR 1 .01; 95% CI: 0.94, 1.09; CI: -0.010, 0.008; p=0.79). Similar results were seen using the alternative measure, the number of adverse incidences Both types of intervention showed no statistically significantly increased risk of adverse events compared to control; however, results appeared to favor single-strain interventions compared to interventions including multiple probiotic strains. We also explored the nature of the adverse events encountered in multiple strain studies but found no statistically significant differences in the relative or absolute risk for any of the adverse event groups (gastrointestinal and control group participants. Meta-R egression : Single Versus Multiple P robiotics To find out whether the risk for adverse events was significantly different between these two kinds of interventions, we conducted a meta-regression. The metaregression did not indicate a statistically significant difference for the risk of adverse events between single and multiple strain interventions (relative risk ratio 0.93; 95% CI: 0.82, 1.04; p=0.205). 69 (3e) Does harm differ by products containing only probiotics and those containing a mixture of probiotics and prebiotics? A number of studies were identified that investigated a synbiotic product; that is containing a probiotic as well as a prebiotic, or explicitly gave probiotic organisms together with prebiotics. Some studies were identified that compared the effects of probiotics and synbiotics directly. Satokari (2001) and also Alander ( 2001) reported one incident of gastrointestinal symptoms and one participant not completing the study in the pre biotic treatment group (galacto \u00ad oligosaccharide) , and no adverse events in the probiotic group or the group consuming probiotics and prebiotics ( as described in the response to Key Question 1f). Chouraqui (2008) reported 7/70 adverse event group; and 7/70 in a control group (for event details see Evidence Table C4 , Results). De Preter (2006 ) and placebo various sequences and reported that \"some\" participants experienced flatulence in the lactulose and placebo phases. Fujimori (2009) reported no adverse events related to blood counts, liver enzymes, total protein, albumin, total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, serum urea nitrogen, creatinine, preparations). Ishikawa (2005) reported the deaths of two participants who died from colorectal cancer in a probiotic group during a 4-year study on prevention of colorectal tumors compared to one death from colorectal cancer in the group that consumed probiotics and wheat bran biscuits; in addition, one par ticipant in this group died from cerebral hemorrhage, and one reported peritonitis , but no lung cancer death occurred in either group. Tomoda (1991) reported no changes in blood chemistry in treatment groups receiving a Bifidobacterium intervention with or without lactulose. Underwood (2009) reported four cases of necrotizing enterocolitis, six infections, and three cases of feeding intolerance in the probiotics group compared to one, two, and zero incidences of the same outcome in the synbiotic group. Worth ley (2009) reported that 11/18 participants in the synbiotic group reported excessive flatus compared to 5/19 in the probiotic group. In the absence of further direct comparisons we investigated differences between probiotics and synbiotics in subgroup analyses and a metaregression. Probiotics Only Probiotic studies showed CI: 0.92, 1.04; p=0.446) for the number of participants with adverse events, comparing probiotics and control groups, and a risk difference of -0.001 CI: -0.05, 0.004; p=0.681). Using the number of incidences per group as an alternative measure, no significant difference between probiotics and control groups are shown either also explored the nature of the adverse events encountered in all studies that used a probiotic rather than a synbiotic and found no differences in the relative or absolute risk for any of the adverse event groups, comparing intervention and control group participants (gastrointestinal events : Selecting only synbiotic studies, that is, studies that explicitly g ave a product that contained prebiotics as well as probiotics , or studies that g ave probiotics together with prebiotics, we f ound a slightly higher risk of adverse events than seen in the probiotics-only studies d ifferen ce between intervention and control group participants, based on the number of participants with adverse events . This result was confirmed using the alternative measure, the number of adverse event also explored the nature of the adverse events encountered in studies using synbiotics and found no statistically significant differences in the relative or absolute risk for any of the adverse event groups (gas trointestinal events : Meta-R egression : Probiotics Versus Synbiotics To establish whether the results seen in probiotics only and synbiotics studies differ statistically significantly, a metaregression was undertaken. This analysis indicated no statistically significant difference in the number of adverse events ( 1.44; CI: 0.93, 1.09; p=0.879 for adverse event incidences). Summary and Strength of Evidence Key Question 3 What is the evidence that harms of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus , and Bacillus differ by product and delivery chara cteristics? Volume : Varied across questions Risk of bias : Medium The evidence to answer this Key Question stem from a variety of study designs and quality. Consistency: Inconsistent Very few studies overall were identified that directly compared delive ry characteristics . Indirect comparisons showed only trends in replications rather than confirming exact results. Directness: Indirect Very f ew direct comparisons were identified; the majority of comparisons were indirect, across different RCTs . Precisio n: Imprecise The maj ority of included studies used small or moderate sample sizes and although some large studies were included, these were not designed to monitor adverse events. Overall, the identified evidence is insufficient to answer the Key Question with confidence. 71 The lack of detail in the description of administered probiotic organisms in most studies hindered evaluations of the safety. Many studies did not specify which probiotic strains were investigated , nor was there indication that intervention preparations were tested for identity of the included organisms, viability, or contaminants. Stratified analy ses by probiotic genus identified a large number of studies exclusively using Lactobacillus strains ; about a dozen studies on Bifidobacterium entered stratified analyses ; and there w ere a small number of exclusive Saccharomyces interventions. H owever , there were very few studies using Streptococcus , Enterococcus , and Bacillus strains exclusively , and only some studies using these genera in combination with other genera. Due to the absence of studies on the latter group, there is an insufficient evidence base to answer product- specific safety questions . However, even for Lactobacillus , Bifidobacterium , and Saccharomyces research , there is a lack of direct comparisons between genera; information on the genera-specific safety of probiotics is primarily based on indirect comparisons. Stratified analyses indicated that adverse events were not statistically significantly increased in treatment participan ts compared to control group participants for any of the reviewed genera. In indirect comparisons, there was some indication that interventions including Streptococcus strains showed more adverse events compared to the other genera, but as outlined before, the risk for intervention participants relative to control group participants was also not increased in these interventions. There is a lack of studies directly comparing product characteristics. There was some indication across studies that safety findings may differ by delivery vehicle. Intervention participants in yogurt or dairy product studies were more likely to experience adverse event incidences than control group participants in subgroup analyses (RR 1.37; 95% CI : 1.05, 1.79; p=0.022). H owever , studies directly comparing delivery vehicles are missing . The only included studies that compared the form of probiotic organism s directly compared viable and heat-killed organisms. Heat-killed organisms are not included in prominent definitions of probioti cs; hence, this comparison is of minor interest. There was no indication that active forms were associated with a higher number of adverse events. The reporting of the form of organisms was too poor in included studies to allow a systematic investigation of the influence of the form. There was a trend of single probiotic studies to report fewer adverse events compared to studies using a mixture of organisms; however, this finding was based on an indirect comparison across studies , in the absence of direct comparisons, and the difference did not reach statistical significance. We did not identify evidence showing that synbiotics differ from probiotics with respect to adverse events ; however, there is a lack of direct comparisons. Key Question 4. How do the h arms of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus , and Bacillus vary based on (a) dose (cfu); (b) timing; (c) mode of administration ( e.g., catheter); (d) age (all ages, including infants), gender, ethnicity, disease or imm unologic status of the patient; (e) relationship to efficacy? Although a large number of probiotics studies are included in the review, the identified studies rarely addressed more complex questions such as associat ions of participant or study characteris tics and adverse events , which should be investigated with appropriate multivariate 72 methods. The number of studies contributing to answer the Key Questions varied across subquestions. (4a) Is there a threshold or dose -response relationship between probioti cs and harm? Does the duration of intervention relate to harm? Threshold/Dose Response Few studies were identified that comp ared different doses of a probiotic product. We considered the daily dose, rather than the length of exposure, for this question. Lactobacillus. In the controlled trials, most studies investigated effects of Lactobacillus dosing. Basu (2009 ) compared two doses of 1010 and 1012 cfu of LGG powder among children with acute watery diarrhea and recorded that five children in the higher dose group dropped out due to electrolyte imbalance (compared with three in the lower dose group) ; three developed septicemia (compared with one in the low- dose group) ; one death occurred in the control group (compared with none in the treatment groups ). Gao (2010) compared doses using 1 or 2 capsules containing 50 billion cfu Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei and reported 1 case of fever in the higher dose group that was not study-related according to the authors, and 1 incidence of hematochezia in the control group. Hemmerling (2009 ) randomized participants to 5 * 108, 109, 2 * 109 cfu of Lactobacillus crispatus CTV -05 organisms or placebo, and reported that all participants experienced at least 1 of 45 adverse events without any apparent pattern associated with treatment arms. Ishikawa (2003) compared a dose of 2 * 107 versus 108 cfu of Lactobacillus salivarius , Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and reported that 2 participants withdrew due to soft stools and abdominal discomfort, but it was not reported to which group these participants had been allocated . Karvonen (2001) compared Lactobacillus reuteri in doses of 105, 107, and 109 cfu and concluded that abdominal symptoms (days with discomfort, pain, or cramps) were similar across groups of neonates. Lu (2004) compared what they characterized as a low (1.5 * 108 cfu), medium (2.7 * 108 cfu), and high (4 * 108 cfu) dose of Lactobacillus rhamnosus given to participants and reported no episodes of vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, cough, or other allergic reaction. Nobuta (2009) randomized participants to 3 * 109, 6 * 109, 1010, or 3 * 1010 cfu Lactobacillus brevis KB290 or placebo and reported that 1 participant in the first group reported abdominal pain, 1 participant in the second group reported a cold, and 1 participant in the group with the highest dose reported abdominal pain and diarrhea. Petschow (2005) compared a low (106 cfu), medium (107 cfu) and high (108 cfu) dose of LGG and found that stool consistency, flatulence , and fussiness were similar among groups. Tursi (2008) randomized participants to various doses of Lactobacillus casei casei DG and reported 2 incidences of epigastric pain, 1 nausea, 1 diarrhea, but the group allocation was unclear ; 1 participant in the 1.6 * 10 7 group developed acute bronchial pneumonia. Bifidobacterium (alone or i n combination). Gill (2001) compared Bifidobacterium lactis HN019 given in a dose of 5 * 1010 or 5 * 109 cfu and 1 participant in the lower dose reported digestive discomfort. Guyonnet (2009) compared a group eating 1 pot of a commercially available probiotic yogurt versus 2 pots of yogurt (each containing 1.25 * 1010 cfu Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173010 and yogurt Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus ) and reported no adverse effects on digestive comfort. Larsen (2006) compared doses of 108, 109, 1010, and 1011 reported 1 case of diarrhea in the 1010 group and that across 73 all groups, 68 percent of participants reported flatulence, 37 percent of abdominal bloating, and 22 percent of headache. Ruiz- Palacios (1996) compared a low (106 cfu), medi um (108 cfu), and high dose (1010 cfu) of a probiotic blend containing Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium infantis and reported that intake, incidence of vomiting, abdominal discomfort, gas, and stool characteristics were not statistically significantly different across groups. Saavedra (2004) compared a dose of 106 and 107 cfu of Bifidobacterium, lactis , Bb 12 and Streptococcus thermophilus and reported that 3 infants in the higher dose treatment group withdrew due to a viral rash, loose stools, or vomi ting. Saccharomyces. De Preter (2006 ) randomized participants to various groups and treatment periods receiving 2 or 4 times 250mg of Saccharomyces boulardii [cerevisiae] and reported that some participants reporte d flatulence during prebiotic intake (but not during probiotic intake). A case series (Elmer, 1995) described a group of participants that used a Saccharomyces boulardii [cerevisiae] product in increasing doses required to achieve a satisfactory response; the study reported that 1/7 participants reported intestinal gas (dose unknown). Streptococcus and Enterococcus . Borgia (1982) compared treatment groups received one, two, or three capsules of Streptococcus [Enterococcus] faecium SF68 or control interventions in a trial to prevent side effects of antibiotic treatment and reported two cardiovascular deaths , but it was not clear to which treatment group these par ticipants had been allocated. Other blends including these genera are described in the Bifidobacterium section. Bacillus (alone or in combination) : No controlled trial was identified that compared differe nt doses of Bacillus . In a case series , Garrido (2005) administered 100mL of a product containing 108 cfu/ml of Lactobacillus and Bacillus strains daily for 1 week, increasing the dose to 200 mL during the second w eek, and 500mL during the third week. They reported mild increases of borborygmi during the last week. Overall, no threshold effect or trend was identified indicating that a higher dose was associated with a larger number of reported adverse events. However, co mparing the exposure across studies , it is apparent that there is no accepted standard of what is considered a low or high dose of exposure . The high dose in one comparative study is the low dose in another. Dosing depended in part on the publication year , with later publications using higher doses, and the dose characteristics are also likely to be genera or species dependent, precluding systematic analyses . In addition, many studies used a mixture of organisms, confounding potentially existing effe cts of dose-response relationships for specific genera, species , or strains . Intervention Duration Many of the included studies used intervention periods of short duration, often only 1 week . For analysis purposes, we characterized short -term use as 1 month or less and long- term use as 1 year or more. In total, 46 percent of studies reported intervention periods of 1 month or less. Only 5 percent of all identified studies reported on long-term use of probiotic products. In the remaining studies (49 percent ), participants used probiotics for longer than 1 month but less than 1 year (medium- term use), or in rare cases , it could not be established how long the study product was used. The exact reported intervention duration is shown for each study in Evidence 74 Table C2 , Intervention. We undertook stratified analyses and metaregression to explore whether the intervention duration is associated with encountered adverse events. Short- term use. The relative risk of adverse events across all short -term studies was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.89, 1.17; p=0.780), with no detectable risk differences between treatment and control groups (RD 0.000; 95% CI : -0.005, 0.004; p=0.866) based on the number of participants with adverse events. Using the alternative measure, the number of adv erse event incidences, results were -0.002, 0.017; p=0.132). Medium- term use. Medium -term studies showed a relative risk of 0.98 (95 % CI : on the number of participants with adverse events. The total number of adverse event incidences showed very similar results (RR 95% 0.003; p=0.914), also indicating no increased risk of adverse events for intervention participants compared to controls. Long- term use. Adverse events associated with l ong-term use is of particular interest. The 18 identified studies that reported on long- term use (defined as one year or longer) incl uded 1 case study (Jensen, 1976) that described a patient who used Saccharomyces boulardii [cerevisiae] for several years and was hospitalized for fever of unknown origin. We did not identify any other observational studies, such as case series , on long- term use. The other long- term studies were controlled trials ; adverse events results varied , sometimes favor ing the intervention, sometimes the control group. To investigate whether the intervention duration was associated with an increased risk of adverse events , we undertook a subgroup analysis for long- term use in parallel RCTs. The individual RCTs investigated Lactobacillus interventions intervention In press) , a blend of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains (Gionchetti, 2003; Ishikawa, 2003), or (Miele, 2009; Mimura, 2004). First, c onsidering the number of participants with adverse events, t he relative risk was RR: 0.76; 95% CI : 0.41, 1.39; p=0.259) for intervention participants compared to control group participants, with a trend favoring intervention participants, although not statistically significantly . The forest plot in Figure 21 shows the individual studies that entered the analysis. 75 Figure 21. RR number of participants with adverse events in long -term use RCTs Individual study results varied, sometimes favoring the probiotics group, sometimes the control group. The risk difference between treatment and control group participants was very small and not statistically significant ( RD -0.006; 95% CI -0.016, 0.004; p=0.259). Using an alternative measure, the total reported incidences per g roup, the results also do not indicate a relative or absolute risk differen ce from control group participants (RR -0.014, 0.005; p=0.311). Each individual encountered adverse event in the intervention and control groups is documented in the Evidence Table C4, Results. To explore the nature of the adverse events associated with long -term use , we differentiated gastrointestinal complaints, infections and infestations , and other adverse events and undertook separate analys es. None of the analyses indicated an increased risk of adverse events in any of the three categories , compared to control group participants (gastrointestinal events: RR CI : and infestations : RR 1. 84; 95 % CI : 0.59, 5.74; p=0.293; all other adverse events: 0.59, 5.02; p=0.075). Metaregression . None of the stratified analyses indicated a statistically significantly increased risk of adverse events for intervention participants compared to control group participants. However, the subgroup analyses indicated that long- term use may be associated with fewer adverse events compared to results found in short-term and medium- term use studies. In order to investigate whether the results diffe r statistically significantly between studies , we undertook a meta -regression. For this , two different analyses were available. First, we used a categorical variable differentiating short- term, medium-term, and long- term use. For the number of participants with adverse events, no statistically significant difference was found (p=0.596); however, for the number of adverse event incidences, studies differed 76 significantly across short-, medium-, and long-term use (p=0.039). We then used the intervention duration as a continuous variable, extract ing the exact duration of the intervention in months. This analysis did not confirm a statistically significant difference between studies associated with the length of the intervention; neither an analysis based on the number of participants with adverse events (p=0.115), nor one based on the number of adverse event incidences ( p=0.162) showed a statistically significant difference . It has to be kept in mind that the proportion of identified long- term use studies was very small compared to the overwhelming proportion of short- and medium- term studies reported in the literature . (4b) Is there a relationship between time of onset of harm and time of probiotic administration? How does time of exposure affect harm? Is harm sustained after the intervention or exposure stops? For the purpose of this review, we recorded the time of onset of the harm whenever possible. The time of onset was then compared to the timing of the administration of the probiotic. We also recorded any information regarding the clinical course of adverse events and the length of time for which harms were sustained after the intervention was stopped and the participant was no longer exposed to the probiotic product. Few studies provided information on the onset of adverse events , but some of these studies, in particular the case studies, gave some insight into the development of harms. Timing descriptions included information on gastrointestinal side effects such as constipation, which was reported in two studies. In one of these studies, constipation began 2 weeks after treatment while another did not pass stools beginning on the third day of the intervention period (Hirata, 2002; Rosenfeldt, 2002) and 10 days afte r treatment in one case (Loguercio, 1987). Loose stools and diarrhea were also reported on the first day of treatment, 3 days into treatment, on days 3 to 7 of treatment, and accompanied by abdominal discomfort aft er 1 week of taking probiotic (Black, 1991; Fukuda, 2008; Gotteland, 2003; Ishikawa, 2003) ; at 10 days (Mimura, 2004) ; in the third week of treatment after dose increase (Garrido, 2005) ; or after 1 month (Glintborg, 2007). Projectile vomiting after 2 hours was reported in one infant (Hwang, 2009). Vomiting occurred on the first day of treatment and incidences continued until the third day (Isolauri, 1991) in another study. One study reported one par ticipant leaving the study on the second day due to nausea (Tasli, 2006); large amounts of gas on the third day (Beck, 1961) ; increased appetite was reported for the first 5 days of treatment (Anukam, 2006), another reported that four par ticipants discontinued during the first week because of vomiting (Xiao, 2003); and bloating occurred primarily during the first week of treatment in three reports (Gionchetti, 2007; Parfenov, 2005; Ranganathan, 2009). One study reported that one par ticipant dropped out on day 11, following 1 week of abdominal pain (Nobuta, 2009) . General gastrointestinal side effects were reported in anotherone study at week 1 (Lee, 2010). With regard to infections, a submandibular abscess was noted 2 weeks after study entry in one study (Vleggaar, 2008); one par ticipant received antibiotics for bronchitis after 3 weeks (Reid, 2001); one infant developed a viral rash after 30 days (Saavedra, 2004); an abscess developed after 4 weeks (Conen, 2009); a coryza -like illness developed in the second month of treatment (Ishikawa, 2003); one case of liver abscess was reported in one case after 4 months of probiotic ingestion (Rautio, 1999); D-lactic acidosis was diagnosed after 3 months (Oh, 1979), and 4 months (Ku, 2006). Reports of more serious infections included incidences of fungemia and bacteremia. C ases of fungemia Munoz, 2005), 8 days (Hennequin, 2000; Munoz, 2005), 10 days (Ohishi, 2010), 13 days (Pletinex, 1995), 18 days (Bassetti, 1998) , 20 days (Riquelme, 2003), 21 days (Niault, 1999), 32 days (Hennequin, 2000), 7 weeks (Hennequin, 2000; Trautmann, 2008) and 2 months (Hennequin, 2000) after starting treatment. Bacteremia was seen after a median of 9 days in four patients (Richard, 1988) and 1.5 weeks (De Groote, 2005), 20 days (Land, 2005), and 3 weeks (Ledoux, 2006) after starting probiotic treatment. Sepsis started after \"several \" days (Rijnders, 2000), 6 days (Lestin, 2003), 23 days (Kunz, 2004), and 179 days (Kunz, 2004) of treatment. These adverse events developed while u sing probiotics. O nly Niault (1999) and Land (2005) reported on adverse events that developed after the treatment was stopped. Other adverse events that occurred included local burning and irritation on the first 2 days of product application (Di Pierro, 2009); colposcopy findings of erythema, petechiae, edema, abrasion on days 1, 7 and/or 14 (Hemmerling, 2009); anemia in 1 infant at 6 months and in 16 at 2 years (Kuitunen, 2009); one case of cervicobrachialgia that began 2 weeks after stopping activ e treatment (Ligaarden, 2010); increased days with eye symptoms early in treatment (Ouwehand, 2009); and a flare of rheumatoid arthritis at week 1 in one par ticipant (Lee, 2010). Few studies provided information on the clinical course of experienced adverse events. Gastrointestinal events appeared to resolve spontaneously, regardless of whether the intervention was continued or discontinued. The described cases of bacteremia and sepsis resolved within 24 to 72 hours (Bassetti, 1998; Land, 2005) or 8 days (Ledoux, 2006) in the studies that provided information on the clinical course. Blood cultures were negative after 10 days (Kunz, 2004) and 21 days (De Groote, 2005). Fungemia resolved within 58 hours (Hennequin, 2000), 6 days (Viggiano, 1995), 8 days (Piechno, 2007), 10 days (Pletinex, 1995), 11 days (Riquelme, 2003), 13 days (Trautmann, 2008), 15 days (Niault, 1999), 18 days (Riquelme, 2003), 60 days (Hennequin, 2000), 3 weeks (Hennequin, 2000), or 6 months (Conen, 2009) . Sepsis cleared after 14 days (Zein, 2008). Burning and irritation lasted only a few hours (Di Pierro, 2009) . Increased eye symptoms resolved within a month (O uwehand, 2009). One par ticipant experienced pseudomonas aeruginosa septicemia from leg cellulitis believed to be due to spending time in a public hot tub (Bajaj, 2008) and died on day 67 of the study. (4c) Does th e route of administration ( e.g., orally, jejunostomy tube, central venous catheter) relate to harm? We differentiated a number of enteral feeding, intravaginal , and topical routes of administration \u2014to investigate whether the route of administration of probiotics is linked to the risk of adverse events. As the route of administration depends primarily on clinical necessity, no study was identified that directly compared two routes of administration. To identify potentially different safety trends associated with the use of a particular route of administration , we undertook stratified analyses and a metaregression to compare across studies. Oral Administration In most of the included studies, the participan ts consumed the probiotic organisms orally (272/387); participants swallowed pills or capsules or ate probiotics -enriched food. This number included 17 case studies that reported the mode of administration. 78 To investigate whether adverse events are more fr equent in probiotic interventions compared to control interventions, we undertook a stratified analysis. Across all parallel RCTs that reported oral administration , the relative risk of adverse events for intervention participants compared to controls was 0.98 (95% CI : 0.93, 1.04; p=0.581) based on the number of participants with adverse events. The corresponding risk difference between groups was -0.001 (95% CI : -0.005, 0.003; p=0.207). Based on the alternative measure, the number of adverse event incidences, no statistically significant difference between intervention and control group participants could be found either (RR 1.01; 95% CI : -0.002, 0.009; p=0.207). To explore the nature of encountered adverse events, we differentiated gastrointestinal complaints, infections and infestations, and all other reported adverse events. In none of the categories did the probiotic intervention group show an increased risk compared to control (gastrointestinal: RR 1.06; 95% CI : -0.004, 0.003; p=0.867). Individual adverse events reported in each study are shown in Evidence T able C4 , Results. Enteral Administration A number of studies (43/387) reported on interventions where probiotics were administered through enteral feeding tubes in hospitalized patients. We grouped all studies that described the use of a nasal tube or gastric feeding tubes , or indicated a jejunostomy in this category. This group included 11 of the 29 case studies that reported the mode of administration for described patient s. To investigate whether this group of studies reported more adverse events in a probiotics group than in a control group from the same patient population, we undertook a stratified analysis. Even if adverse events are more likely in patients need ing enteral feeding overall, and events may have a greater clinical impact in these people (e.g., an infection), it is critical to evaluate whether patients on probiotics experience more adverse events relative to a control group with similar patient characteristics. A pooled analysis based on the number of participants with adverse events indicated no statistically significantly different risk or trend of an increased risk compared to control (RR 0.84; 95% CI : the alternative measure, the number of adverse event incidences, no statistically significantly increased risk was identified either (RR 1.15; 95% CI : -0.009, 0.011; p=0.777). To explore the nature of encountered adverse events, we differentiated gastrointestinal complaints, infections and infestations, and all other reported adverse events. In none of the categories did the probiotic intervention group show an increased risk compared to controls (gastrointestinal events : RR 0.85; 95% CI -0.013, 0.020; p=0.637). Individual adverse events reported in each study are shown in Evidence T able C4, Results. 79 Other R outes of Administration Fifteen studies included in this review investigated the intravaginal administration of probiotic organisms. Most of the adverse events related to the administration of probiotic organism s or placebo were mild to moderate (such as vaginal discharge ). None of the case studies reported this mode of administration. Based on the number of women with adverse events in each treatment group, the parallel RCTs reported no statistically increased risk of adverse events compared to control s (RR 1.06; 95% CI : -0.054, 0.046; p=0.870). No statistically significant difference compared to control or even a trend for increased risk of events was identified in the alternative measure, the number of adverse event incidences either -0.039, 0.012; p=0.313). To explore the nature of encountered adverse events in studies with an intravaginal administration of probiotics, we differentiated gastrointestinal complaints, infections and infestations, and all other reported adverse events. In none of the adve rse event categories did the probiotic intervention group show an increased risk compared to control (gastrointestinal events : RR 0.67; 95% CI : : -0.052, 0.020; p=0.389). Individual adverse events reported in each study are shown in Evidence Table C4 , Resul ts. With regard to other routes of administration, four studies reported a topical application of probiotic organisms. Details of the intervention and the adverse events results are shown in the evidence tables. Across the three parallel RCTs , no statistically significant difference in adverse events between intervention and control group could be detected (RR 1.06; 95% CI : 0.65, : -0.045, 0.0140; p=0.311). The nature of the adverse events encountered with topical applications varied. Falck (1999) used alpha-streptococci to treat recurrence of streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis and reported that 16 percent of par ticipants reported respiratory complaints related to the common cold compared to 13 percent in the control group. Klarin (2008) reported 5/23 deaths in the treatment group (Lactobacillus plantarum 299) compared to 6/21 in the control group of intubated patients. Peral (2009) reported that five patients with burns in the Lactobacillus plantarum group had (tolerable) pain, there were no l ocal or systemic allergic symptoms , and the administered organism was not found in blood or wound samples. Roos (1996) reported 13 par ticipants with throat pain, headache, coughing, runny nose, common cold, and fever compared to 18 control group participants reporting similar adverse events, among the 130 par ticipants with streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis. The case of Saccharomyces boulardii [cerevisiae] sepsis reported by Piechno (2007) described the use of an intravenous catheter for parenteral nutrition; no other study reported explicitly on this route of administration Metaregression : Routes of Administration To investigate whether study results different significantly based on the route of administration , we undertook a metaregression adding the route of administration as a moderator in the meta -analysis. Based on both alternative measures of adverse event risks , no statistically significant difference was found (number of participants with adverse events : p=0.840; number of adverse event incidences: p=0.633). In addition, enteral feeding is a route of administration as 80 well as intrinsically related to the participant characteristics. Differences associated with participant characteristics, such as the health status, are described in the next result section (4d). (4d) How does harm relate to subpopulations, includin g different age groups (specifically including neonates and infants under age 24 months), men and women, ethnic/race subgroups, or health status (healthy to high risk) individuals? Age The majority of the identified studies included adult participants . We distinguished, where possible, studies in children (up to 18), adults, and elderly participants (using 65 as the age cut\u00ad off). Children. We identified 123 studies that included children. Some of the studies in children exposed them to probiotic organisms prenatally with the mother consuming probiotic organisms as well as postnatal ly. Overall, studies in children tended to be better reported than studies in adults. This pertained to the reporting of the intervention (e.g., reporting the strain of the admi nistered probiotics) and the reporting of the adverse events (e.g., reporting a list of adverse events that was determined a priori and monitored and then reporting on the results ). Seventeen of the included 43 case studies described children (Barton, 2001; Cesaro, identified 35 parallel RCTs that reported the total number of participating children in a group receiving probiotics compared to a group of children not using probiotics, and the total number of children with adverse events per treatment group. Most studies in children investigated Lactobacillus interventions, alone or in combination with Bifidobacterium , some studies used only Bifidobacterium strains (in infant formulae), and there were some exceptions of studies using Saccharomyces (Kurugol, 2005), Str eptococcus (Roos, 2001), Enterococcus (Bellomo, 1979), or Bacillus (La Rosa, 2003 [ Lactobacillus sporogenes ]) strain interventions. The relative risk of children in probiotics groups to experience an adverse event was not statistically significantly different from children receiving the control intervention (RR 0.96; 95% CI : 0.88, 1.04; p=0.296). The forest plot in Figure 22 shows the individual study results. 81 Figure 22. RR number of children with adverse events The ri sk difference across intervention and control group participants was -0.004 (95% CI : \u00ad 0.012, 0.004; p=0.302) based on the number of children with adverse events in each group. The alternative measure, the relative risk of adverse event incidences, was 0.95 (95% CI : 0.87, 1.04; p=0.296) comparing intervention and control groups was similar and the corresponding risk difference was -0.001 (95% CI : -0.004, 0.003; p=0.757); this analysis is based on a much larger number of trials (75 RCTs), as the number of individual adverse event incidences was reported more often than the number of children with adverse events per treatment group. For very young children (under 24 months of age), the relative risk to exp erience an adverse event was 0.96 (95 % CI : 0.88, 1.05; p=0.332; 27 trials) compared to the control group, and the risk difference was -0.005 (95% CI : -0.013, 0.004; p=0.289), indicating no trend for increased adverse events associated with the probiotics intervention. The alternative measure, the relative risk of adverse event incidences, was similar , with a relative risk of 0.94 (95% CI : 0.86, 1.03; p=0.202; 65 RCTs) comparing intervention and control groups, and the corresponding risk difference was -0.001 (CI: -0.005, 0.003; p=0.0505). To explore the nature of encountered adverse events, we differentiated gastrointestinal complaints, infections and infestations, and all other reported adverse events. In none of the categories did the probiotic interventio n group show an increased risk compared to control 82 (gastrointestinal events : RR 0.99; 95% CI -0.005, 0.004; p=0.683). Individual adverse events reported in each study are shown in Evidence T able C4 , Results. Adults. The majority of identified studies included adult participants (233 studies ). A separate meta -analysis for parallel RCTs with only adult participants indicated a relative risk of adults in probiotics group to experience an adverse event of 0.97 (95% CI : 0.79, 1.19; p=0.745) compared to control. The individual results are shown in the forest plot in Figure 23, and the corresponding risk difference was 0.001 (95% CI : -0.009, 0.011; p=0.865). Individual study results varied, sometimes favoring the probiotic intervention group, sometimes the control group. The pooled results indicated no trend that the intervention was associated with a higher risk of adverse events compared to control. Figure 23.RR number of adults with adverse events 83 The alternative measure, the relative risk of adverse event i ncidences, was 1.02 (95% CI : 0.82, 1.27; p=0.851; 63 RCTs) comparing intervention and control groups and the corresponding risk difference was 0.005 (95% CI : -0.005, 0.015; p=0.319), both also not indicating a statistically significant risk of adverse even ts compared to control. To explore the nature of encountered adverse events, we differentiated gastrointestinal complaints, infections and infestations, and all other reported adverse events. In none of the categories did the probiotic intervention group show an increased risk compared to controls (gastrointestinal events : RR 1.17; 95% CI -0.005, 0.012; p=0.430). Individual adverse events reported in each study are shown in Evidence T able C4, Results. Elderly . Although one- third of the identified studies in cluded participants 65 years of age or older, studies exclusively in the elderly account for only 5 percent of the review sample. In addition, e lderly participants were explicitly excluded from 5 percent of the included studies (of those studies that were not in infants or other specified age samples). We identified 17 studies in total that reported exclusively on participants 65 years of age or older. Among these were several case studies of serious infections (Cher ifi, 2004; of the t wo identified case series with elderly participants reported no adverse events (An, 2010); in the other one, two of the par ticipants with dementia died during the followup, and one experienced diarrhea (Carlsson, 2009). Only a small number of controlled trials targeted exclusively elderly participants Simone, 1992; Gill, on four parallel RCTs that reported on the number of participants with adverse events, as depicted in Figure 24, the relative risk of elderly participants in the probiotics group experiencing an adverse event was 0.94 (95% CI : 0.82, 1.08; p=0.367) compared to control s, and the risk difference was -0.013 (95% CI : -0.069, 0.033; p=0.545) indicating that the intervention was not associated with a n increased relativ e risk of adverse events. The individual RCTs investigated Lactobacillus in combination with Bifidobacterium or Streptococcus /Enterococcus strains. 84 Figure 24. RR number of elderly participants with adverse events The nature of the encountered adverse ev ents varied across RCTs that studied participants 65 years of age and older. The Boge (2009) trials reported common infectious diseases , and Guillemard (2010) reported muscular -bone adverse events, gastrointestinal adverse events, and infections other than common infectious diseases , but the exact number per treatment group was not reported. De Simone (1992) reported 2 participants with incidences of intestinal rumbling and fl atulence compared to 1 participant with variation in stool consistency and diarrhea among 15 elderly participants taking Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus acidophilus treatment and 10 elderly control participants . Gill (2001) reported only one case of digestive discomfort in the control group in a study using Bifidobacterium lactis HN019 to enhance immunity. Of the 17 elderly participants with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth described by Stotzer (1996), 1 was excluded from a crossover trial on Lactobacillus fermentum due to the deterioration of her general condition (presumably associated with radiation enteritis after treatment for ovarian cancer) ; 1 other participant was excluded due to side effects not further described. Given the paucity of trials exclusively in the elderly , we also investigated the presence of participants 65 years of age or older in the study sample s and its effects on adverse events. A metaregression showed no statistically significant effect based on the number of participants with adverse events (p=0.438) and based on the number of adverse event incidences (p=0.991). Metaregression . Age : In order to investigate whether different safety results are reported for different age groups for treat ed participants relative to controls (relative risk ratio) , we tested this assumption in a meta -regression. Based on the number of participants with adverse events, t here was no indication that the risk of experiencing an adverse event in the treatment group relative to controls differs by age (p= 0.559, joint sig nificance test) . For the outcome adverse event incidences, no analysis could be undertaken due to the small number of studies in the elderly. 85 Gender Almost all samples in the included studies were of mixed gender . We identified 38 studies describing female participants only and 35 studies that included only male participants . The case studies described more male than female patients , where gender was report ed (see Evidence Table C1 , Study Details) , and 24 of the exclusively male studies were case studies . Very few parallel RCTs with exclusively male participant samples were identified. Studies in female participants were primarily those using the vaginal route of administration , and the results have been described under Key Question 4c. To investigate whether there was any indication that adverse events depended on the sex of the participants , we added gender as a moderator in a metaregression model. This question was investigated using two different approaches. First, we investigated exclusively male and exclusively female parallel RCTs (categorical variable analysis ). Second , we used the number of female participants in each RCT a s a moderator for safety res ults (continuous variable analysis ). In both analyses, there was no indication that encountered adverse events due to probiotics compared to control w as more common in female or in male participant groups based on the number of participants (categorical va riable analysis: p=0.188; continuous variable analysis: p=0.210) and incidences (categorical variable analysis: p=0.123; continuous variable analysis: p=0.447). Ethnicity With regard to race and ethnicity, almost none of the studies targeted a particular demographic group, and many studies provided no information regarding these participants' features , as recorded in the Evidence Table C1 , Participant and Study Details. Health Status The clinical characteristics of participants i ncluded in the identified studies are reported in Evidence Table C1 , Participant and Study Details. The included studies report on par ticipants with widely varying health conditions. In addition to indicating the specific clinical condition (where applicable) , we also differentiated participants on a continuum ranging from generally healthy to critically ill. A large number of included studies (229 studies) could not be classified as enroll ing either critically ill or generally healthy persons but fell into the middle of this continuum. This group included the many studies in participants being treated for a health concern such as IBS , ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, diabetes , or other similar health concerns . Of all included studies, 83 were in participants that could be classified as generally healthy . In all, 76 studies described high-risk patients , that is, those hospitalized for serious health concerns and critically ill patients . Of note, 13 percent of included studies reported explicitly that immunocompromised participa nts were excluded from identified studies. Generally healthy. First, o f all included case studies that reported cases of serious adverse events such as fungemia and bacteremia, only one reported case (see Jensen, 1974) was considered generally healthy before the onset of the observed adverse event. To investiga te whether healthy participants using probiotics were more likely to experience adverse events compared to control group participants not using probiotics we undertook a subgroup analysis for all studies enroll ing generally healthy participants. There was no indication that healthy participants using probiotics were statistically significantly more likely to suffer 86 from adverse events than control group participants based on the number of participants with adverse events (RR 0.95; 95% CI -0.016, 0.008; and similar results were seen based on the number of adverse event incidences (RR -0.004, 0.020; p=0.213). To explore the nature of encountered adverse events, we differentiated gastrointestinal complaints, infections and infestations, and other adverse events. There was no indication of a statistically significantly increased risk of gastrointestinal complaints ( RR -0.005, 0.009; p=0.198). There was a trend for more other adverse events compared to control (RR 1.30; 95% CI : However , this trend was not statistically significant across studies. Medium health status. For 17 case studies , the preceding health status of the presented patients was categorized as medium on a scale ranging fr om generally healthy to critically ill, the described patients varied, or the health status before the probiotic associated adverse event was not reported. To investigate whether the participants with medium health status studied in the included trials wer e more likely to experience adverse events compared to control group participants not using probiotics we undertook a subgroup analysis for all parallel RCTs studying this health status group. There was no indication that participants with medium health status were statistically significantly more likely to suffer from adverse events than control group participants , based on the number of participants with adverse events (RR 1.03; 95% CI : 0.94, : -0.005, 0.003; p=0.475), and similar results were seen based on the number of adverse event incidences (RR -0.004, 0.008; p=0.560). To explore the nature of encountered adverse events, we differentiated gastrointestinal complaints, infections and infestations, and other adverse events. There was no indication of a statistically significantly increased risk of gastrointestinal complaints ( RR Critically ill. Twenty -five case studies reporting 42 cases (Barton, described a high -risk patient, an individual who was critically ill be fore consuming probiotic organisms and experienced any subsequent associated harms. Described cases were patients who were already hospitalized for other conditions, who suffered from multiple health concerns, or who had to be considered high risk due to a serious health condition. Adverse events are more likely and potentially more harmful in critically ill and high -risk patients . To investigate whether any of the observed adverse events could be linked to probiotic 87 intake, we undertook a stratified anal ysis for all parallel RCTs studying critically ill or high- risk patients , such as patients currently being treated in an intensive care unit or babies with very low birth weight. This analysis can show whether participants using probiotics were more likely to experience adverse events compared to a control group with similar health status and similar co \u00ad interventions and risk factors apart from the probiotics intake. Almost all interventions in critically ill patients included Lactobacillus strains. Some studies used Bifidobacterium strains alone or in combination with Lactobacillus . Across studies, t here was no indication that critically ill and high risk participants taking probiotics were more likely to experience adverse events than control participants with the same health status (RR 0.79; 95% CI: 0.51, 1.22; p=0.286) when comparing the number of participants with adverse events per treatment arm . The forest plot in Figure 25 shows results obtained in individual studies. Figure 25. RR number of critica lly ill or high -risk participants with adverse events Results differed in individual studies, sometimes favoring the probiotics, sometimes the control group. The observed risk difference across treatment and control group participants was \u00ad0.001 (95% CI : -0.020, 0.019; p=0.955). Using the alternative measure, the number of incidences per treatment arm , the relative risk for treatment group participants was 0.91 (95% CI : 0.76, 1.09; p=0.297). The risk difference between treatment and control group participants was too small to be detected ( RD 0.000; 95% CI : -0.005, 0.004; p=0.62). To explore the nature of adverse events encountered in studies of critically ill or high risk participants , we differentiated gast rointestinal symptoms , infections and infestat ions, and other adverse events . No statistically significant differences between control and intervention 88 participants could be observed for gastrointestinal adverse events (RR 0.91; 95% CI : -0.007, 0.006; p=0.787). We explored in a sensitivity analysis whether the difference in adverse events is still non\u00ad significant wh en the deaths reported in the PROPATRIA trial (Besselink, 2008) are added . In our categorization system, the patients and their baseline disease were not seen as critically ill , but the patients were predicted to have a severe disease course; hence, it is possible to classify them as critically ill/high risk. The sensitivity analysis showed similar results, also no t indicating a statistically significantly increased risk of adverse events (RR 0.98; 95% CI : . Health status : To investigate whether the reported adverse events differed across the three types of studies, we u ndertook a metaregression. There was no indication that adverse events differed statistically significantly depending on the health status of the participants, based on the number of participants with adverse events (p=0.329) as well as the number of adverse event incidences (p=0.352) observed in treatment and control groups. (4e) Do randomized controlled studies that report harm show efficacy or no efficacy? In total, 59 percent of included studies that monitored the presence or absence of harms described the intervention as effective; 23 percent described the intervention as not effective, and for the remaining studies, it was not clearly stated or the authors reported mixed results . We used the abstract of the publication as the author's summary statement. The efficacy of the included interventions was not the target of the review; hence, we did not extract data that would allow an independent analysis of the efficacy or effectiveness of the intervention. Whether interventions were considered effective by the authors is indicated for each study in the Evidence Table C4 , Results. To investigate whether reported adverse events are associated with the efficacy of the intervention, we differentiated studies where the intervention was described as effective an d studies where it was described as not effective and added this variable as a moderator to a meta\u00ad analysis. Unclear publications were excluded from this analysis. There was no statistically significant indication that adverse event results differ ed across studies based on the efficacy of the intervention using the number of participants with adverse events (relative risk ratio 0.99; 95% CI : 0.88, 1.12; p=0.909) or the adverse event ratio 0.93; 95% CI : 0.80, 1.08; p=0.352). Summary and Strength of Evidence Key Question 4 How do the harms of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus , and Bacillus vary based on (a) dose (cfu); (b) timing; (c) mode of administration (e.g., catheter); (d) age ( all ages, including infants), gender, ethnicity, disease or immunologic status of the patient; (e) relationship to efficacy? Volume : Varied across questions Risk of bias: Medium 89 The evidence to answer this Key Question stem from a variety of study desig ns and quality. Consistency: Inconsistent The high level of evidence studies show different results from case studies. Directness: Indirect Few direct comparisons; the majority of comparisons are indirect across different studies. Precision: Imprecise The majority of included studies use moderate sample sizes , but studies were pooled in a meta -analysis. The identified evidence is insufficient or has to be characterized as low with regard to being able to answer the Key Question with confidence. Only a f ew studies in the literature explore the effect of intervention and participant characteristics on safety. Very few studies explored the effect of different treatment dos es on the experienced adverse events . Definitions of high and low dose varied across the small number of studies that attempted to conduct dose comparisons. This issue, together with other confounders, hindered systematic evaluation of a dose-response relationship. Very few published studies were identified that investigated the effects o f long- term use of probiotics; information on the safety of long-term consumption is lacking. There were few descriptions of the time of onset of harms and the further clinical cou rse of adverse events. In the few studies that reported on the time of onset of gastrointestinal effects , most effects were observed in the first three days of treatment. The onset of infections tended to occur one or several weeks later, however this information is primarily based on case studies. The described bacteremia cases cleared within 8 days; several fungemia cases took up to 3 weeks to clear. The route of administration is as much an intervention as it is a patient characteristic , and direct comparisons across routes of administrations are unlikely. In indirect comparisons, we found no evidence that the form of administration (oral, enteral, or other) of probiotic organisms pointed to an increased risk of participants in the probiotics group to experience an adverse event relative to a comparable control group from the sam e participant population. Stratified analyses and metaregressions showed no increased risk for adverse events for children , adults, or elderly participants who took probiotics compared to adverse events observed in equivalent control groups ; however it has to be noted that only very few studies were identified that reported on elderly participants. The identified case studies described more male than female patients . In indirect comparisons across RCTs , we found no indication that encountered adverse events relative to control group incidences depend on the sex of the participants. The included studies did not provide enough information to investigate whether safety results are associated with ethnic characteristics. With regard to the health status of participants, there was some indication that health status is associated with the experience of an adverse event when using probiotics. Case studies reporting serious adverse events described health -compromised patients, not generally healthy participants, contract ing (most commonly) a serious infection potentially caused by probiotic organisms. However, a subgroup analysis of RCTs in critically ill patients did not show a statistically 90 significantly increased risk of experiencing adverse events for participan ts using probiotics compared to control group participants with similar patient characteristics. There was no indication that the efficacy of the intervention was associated with encountered adverse events across all included parallel RCTs . Key Question 5. How often does harm associated with Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus , and Bacillus lead to hospital admission or lengthened hospitalization? The following describes the evidence related to hospitalizations as well as serious adverse events. Hospitalizations None of the case series, controlled trials, crossover RCTs , or parallel RCTs indicated that the use a product including Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus , or Bacillu s led to a hospital admission. Evidence for hospital admissions due to probiotics use came only from case studies. However, we also recorded all hospitalizations in included studies, regardless of perceived associations with the study products in question. Lactobacillus intervention. Conen (2009) described a patient with ulcerative colitis who was hospitalized with a neck abscess that the authors associated with the intake of a product containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus (DNA- based identification) . LeDoux (2006) described a patient with AIDS and Hodgkin's disease who presented to the emergency department with fever, intermittent chills , and left neck pain with swelling; the diagnosis of bacteremia due to Lactobacillus acidophilus was associated with the intake of a probiotic medication. Mackay et al. (1999) reported on a patient with Lactobacillus rhamnosus -associated endocarditis who was admitted to the hospital; the patient was taking a probiotic preparation that included rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus , and Streptococcus faecalis . Munakata (2010) described a child with short bowel syndrome admitted to a hospital for evaluation of ataxia; the authors associated the diagnosis of D- lactic acidosis with a probiotic Oh (1979) described a patient brought to the emergency room because of sudden disorientation, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. D- lactic acidosis was associated with Lactobacillus acidophilus intake. Rautio (1999) described a diabet ic patient who was admitted to a hospital because of a 2-week history of mild abdominal discomfort and then fever. The diagnosis of liver abscess was associated with a dairy drink containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (DNA -based identification). Tommasi (2008) described a patient admitted to a hospital for persistent fever and night sweating who was later diagnosed with bacteremia, associated with consumption of Lactobacillus casei - containing products. The case report by Zein (2008) described a hospital admission due to fever, headaches, nausea , and vomiting. The publication linked the Lactobacillus rhamnosus -associated septicemia to a probiotic . No study was identified that reported a new hospitalization other than the potentially Lactobacillus -associated case reported by Zein (2008), which involved use of a probiotics blend that included Bifidobacterium organisms. Saccharomyces intervention. Hwang (2009) reported on an infant who was treated for presumed bacterial colitis and in addition was taking a Saccharomyces boulardii [cerevisiae] product and who presented to the emergency department with repetitive vomiting and cyanosis, requir ing intravenous fluid resuscitation. The condition was assumed to be food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome caused by the probiotic intervention, according to the authors. Jensen (1974) reported on a patient admitted to a hospital with fever, diaphoresis, and nausea, which the authors associated with the patient's use of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae product. Streptococcus intervention. No study was identified that reported a new hospitalization ot her than the potentially Lactobacillus -associated case studies described above that used blends. Enterococcus intervention . No study was identified that reported a new hospitalization other than the potentially Lactobacillus -associated case studies descri bed above that used blends. Bacillus intervention . Oggioni et al. (1998) reported on an immunocompromised pati ent admitted to a hospital with high fever who subsequently developed septicemia that was associated with previous treatment with Bacillus subtilis (DNA-based identification). All other case reports were in patients who were already hospitalized , or an in -hospital treatment was not reported. All hospitalizations . Given that the specific diagnostic reason for hospitalization may be difficult to determine and hospitalizations may not have been associated with probiotic product use at all by other study investigators, we recorded all hospitalizations mentioned in included studies during or after receiving the study intervention. The outcome, hospitalization , was not an inclusion criterion per se for this review. Only hospitalizations recorded in publications addressing adverse events were considered, and studies using the number of hospitalizations as an efficacy or effectiveness measure were not sought. Only new hospitalizations wer e considered for this question; participants already hospitalized when a probiotic intervention was initiated were not counted. As shown in the Evidence Table C4, Results, a number of studies reported SAEs of which several must have led to hospitalizations. However, the studies did not report this outcome explicitly , and in order to provide a systematic evidence overview, only the exact reported outcome was considered for all treatment groups. A case series described by Huynh (2009 ) reported that one child with acute ulcerative colitis taking a product containing various Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus strains was hospitalized for vomiting and diarrhea, diagnosed as viral gastroenteritis. No virus or bacterial pathogens were isolated from the stool. In 12 parallel RCTs that reported the number of new hospitalizations , the relative risk was 1.14 (95% CI : 0.79, 1.65; p=0.470; 11 RCTs) , \u00ad 0.006, 0.020; p=0.276) indicating that the probiotics intervention was not associated with a statistically significantly higher risk of hospitalization across all parallel RCTs. Study authors did not report that the intervention caused the hospitalization s in the included trials, but Gibson (2008) reported 18/72 serious adverse events that required hospitalizations in the treatment group 92 compared to 11/70 in the control group. The au thors reported further that three events in total were judged to be possibly related to the formula intervention (one gastrointestinal problem in each group and one respiratory problem in the control group). None of the identified studies indicated that th e evaluated intervention led to a lengthened hospitalization. Only five the review reported the number of newly hospitalized patients and the length of hospitalization (this number excludes in -hospital samples , and studies that used the length of hospitalization as an efficacy or effectiveness measure were also not sought). In the included controlled studie s, Kerac (2009) reported 27/399 readmissions to hospital in a group of maln ourished Malawian children receiving synbiotics compared to 16/396 children in the control group. The other data on the length of hospitalization stem from c ase studies. The participant described by Oggioni (1998) remained in the hospital 25 days; in the case described by Mackay (1999), 14 days; the child with D- lactic acidosis described by Munakata (2010 ) was hospitalized for 25 days; and the case described by Tommasi (2008) appears to have spent a total of about 90 days in the hospital but not necessarily without interruption when symptoms were under control. Serious Adverse Events We also investigated the quality of the adverse event s, apart from exploring the quantity (Key Question 1) and the nature of the adverse event s (Key Question 2). For all recorded adverse event s reported in the individual studies, we assessed whether the experienced harm was a serious adverse event such as a hospitalization or recorded incidences of death . For a conservative analysis , we also included any sign of probiotics bacteria in blood samples as a serious adverse event. Several included studies reported on the presence or absence of serious adverse event s, in particular the case studies. The results of case studies have been summarized in Key Question 1c. However, some controlled studies also reported on the presence or absence of serious adverse events and these studies allow a comparison of the risk experienced in a probiotic group compared to that of participants not using probiotics but from a similar population and with comparable underlying diseases, cointerventions , and other factors that may contribute to serious adverse events . Some of the included studies enrolled critically ill patients ; the occurrence of serious adverse events and health concerns regardless of any association with probiotics is more likely in this c linical population than in other participant groups. In total, 67 parallel RCTs reported on the presence or the absence of at least one serious adverse event, recorded the number of serious adverse event incidences in the treatment and the control group a rms, and also reported the total number of participants in each treatment arm. Only the main treatment group was compared with the control group most similar to the treatment group minus the probiotics. The relative risk of a serious adverse event was 1.06 (95% CI : 0.97, 1.16; p=0.201), indicating that probiotics interventions were not associated with a statistically significantly higher risk of serious adverse events. The forest plot for the relative risk is shown in Figure 26. The graph is ordered by the included probiotic gen era, starting with Lactobacillus , used alone or in combination with other genera, followed by Bifidobacterium (#2) interventions that did not include a Lactobacillus strain , and finally Saccharomyces (#3) interventions without Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium strains In total, 39 percent of studies investigated blends, and most often the blend included a Lactobacillus strain. The lack of Streptococ cus, Enterococcus , and Bacillus interventions is highlighted in the following text. 93 Figure 26. RR number of participants with serious adverse events Results in most included trials were accompanied by wide confidence intervals , and the obtained relative ri sks within the individual RCTs varied greatly , sometimes favoring the probiotics group, sometimes the control group. A large effect indicating problems with probiotics was seen only in the PROPATRIA trial (Besselink, 2008), a failed effectiveness study in patients with acute pancreatitis. The pooled risk difference for a serious adverse event was not detectable (RD 0.000; 95% CI : -0.003, 0.003; p=0.866) across the treatment groups. The risk of a serious 94 adverse event was low in both groups, and the difference between the probiotic and control groups was not detectable. The Evidence Table C4 , Results shows all serious adverse events reported in all included studies. Lactobacillus intervention. As documented in the Key Question 1 section , the serious adverse events associated with a Lactobacillus intervention where administered species or strains were matched with genetic fingerprinting approaches included two cases of an abscess , two cases of bacteremia, and one case of sepsis. To quantify the risk of serious adverse events associated with Lactobacillus strains , we stratified parallel RCTs by genus. Interventions exclusively using Lactobacillus strains indicated no increased risk of serious adverse events compared to controls (RR 1.03; 95% CI : -0.006, 0.006; p=0.981). In order to explore further whether the genus of the organism could be associated with reported serious adverse events, we undertook a metaregression adding the genus as a moderator to a meta- analysis of serious adverse events. This analysis compared studies that used Lactobacillus strains, alone or in combinations with other microorganisms, with interventions that did not. The relative risk ratio across studies did not indicate that the Lactobacillus genus was associated with a statistically significa ntly different risk of serious adverse events compared to other genera (relative risk ratio 1.07; 95% CI : 0.78, 1.46; p=0.423). Bifidobacterium intervention . As documented in the Key Question 1 section , the serious adverse events associated with a Bifido bacterium interventions where administered species or strains were matched with genetic fingerprinting approaches included one documented case of septicemia. No stratified analysis of parallel RCTs to quantify the risk of serious adverse events could be undertaken , as no study was identified that used exclusively Bifidobacterium strains and reported on the presence or the absence of a serious adverse event. A metaregression adding the presence of the genus Bifidobacterium in the intervention as a moderator to a meta -analysis of serious adverse events did not indicate that the Bifidobacterium genus was associated with a statistically significantly increased risk of serious adverse events (relative risk ratio 1.18; 95% CI: 0.96, 1.47; p=0.814). Saccharomyces intervention in the Key Question 1 section , the serious adverse events associated with a Saccharomyces interventions where administered species were matched with genetic fingerprinting approaches included 20 cases of fungemia. No stratified analysis could be undertaken for parallel RCTs to quantify the risk , as no study was identified that used exclusively Saccharomyces strains and reported on the presence or the absence of a serious adverse event. A metaregression adding the presence of the genus Saccharomyces in the intervention as a moderator to a meta-analysis of serious adverse events did not indicate that the Saccharomyces genus was associated with a statistically significantly increased risk of serious adverse events (relative risk rat io 0.68; 95% CI : 0.22, 2.07; p=0.494). Streptococcus intervention. No Streptococcus intervention where administered species were matched with genetic fingerprinting approaches was identified, and a stratified analysis for parallel RCTs also could not be undertaken, as no study was identified that used exclusively Streptococcus strains and reported on the presence or the absence of a serious adverse event. A metaregression adding the presence of the genus Streptococcus in the intervention as a moderator 95 to a meta-analysis of serious adverse events did not indicate that the Streptococcus genus was associated with a statistically significantly increased risk of serious adverse events (relative risk ratio 1.17; 95% CI No Enterococcus intervention where administered species were matched with genetic fingerprinting approaches was identified and a stratified analysis for parallel RCTs could also not be undertaken, as no study was identified that used exclusively Enterococcus strains and reported on the presence or the absence of a serious adverse event. A metaregression adding the presence of the genus Enterococcus in the intervention as a moderator to a meta -analysis of serious adverse events did not indicate tha t the Enterococcus genus was associated with a statistically significantly increased risk of serious adverse events (relative risk ratio 0.59; 95% CI : 0.06, 6.05; p=0.656). Bacillus intervention . As documented in the Key Question 1 section , the serious a dverse events associated with a Bacillus intervention where administered species were matched with genetic fingerprinting approaches included 1 case of sepsis. No stratified analysis and metaregression could be undertaken for parallel RCTs to quantify the risk of serious adverse events due to the lack of Bacillus studies reporting on serious adverse events. We also explored pertinent subgroups that were identified in the review with regard to serious adverse events. The quality of adverse events can be ver y different , ranging from mild complaints to critical events , and analyses in prior chapters have shown that some investigated participants and some intervention characteristics warrant more exploration. Serious adverse events by health status. We also exp lored whether critically ill participants taking probiotics were more likely to experience serious adverse events compared to control group participants. In these patients, serious adverse events are of critical importance. There was no indication that cri tically ill patients were more likely to experience serious adverse events when we stratified results for this subgroup. The relative risk in studies with participants of this health status to experience a serious adverse event was 1.01 (95% CI : 0.89, -0.004, 0.004; relative to control group participants with similar clinical symptomatology. In addition, we added health status as a variable to a meta- analysis in order to see if health status moderates reported serious adverse events seen in participants relative to control group participants, but there was also no empirical evidence for an increased or reduced risk of serious adverse events that depended on the participants' health status (p=0.481). Serious adverse events by participant age. Children in probiotics groups were not more likely to experience serious adverse events than control group participants (RR 1.02; 95% CI : 0.92, : -0.006, 0.003, p=0.458). The few published studies in the elderly did not report on the presence or absence of serious adverse events. Comparing the relative risk ratio of children and adults for serious adverse events, there was a significant difference (p=0.019) indicating that adults in probiotics groups were more likely to experience serious adverse events ; however this result was driven entirely by the PROPATRIA trial (Besselink, 2008) in acute pancreatitis , which report ed statistically significantly more incide nces of death in the probiotics group compared to control. Excluding this study, there was no evidence of serious adverse event results being moderated by participants' ages (p=0.728). 96 Serious adverse events by delivery vehicle. Stratified analyses indicated that yogurt and dairy delivery vehicles may influence the ratio of risks for adverse events seen in intervention and control groups. There was no evidence that intervention participants in yogurt and dairy studies were statistically more likely to experience adverse events compared to control group participants (RR 1.16; 95% CI : -0.009, 0.012, p=0.219). In addition, we added delivery vehicles as a variable to a meta -analysis in order to see if this factor moderated reported serious adverse events seen in participants relative to control group participants, but there was also no empirical evidence for an increased or reduced risk of serious adverse events depending on the vehicle the probiotic organisms were delivered in (p=0.998). Serious adverse events by route of administration. There was a trend but no evidence for a statistically significantly different risk for patients receiving probiotics through enteral feeding tubes to experience a serious adverse event co mpared to control group participants (RR 1.21; 95% CI : : -0.008, 0.011, p=0.694), based on the existing literature. We also added routes of administration as a variable to a meta -analysis in order to see if these factor s moderate d the serious adverse events seen in participants relative to control group participants , but there was no evidence for an increased or reduced risk of serious adverse events that depended on the route of administration (p=0.714). Summary and Strength of Evidence Key Question 5 How often does harm associated with Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus , and Bacillus lead to hospital admission or lengthened hospitalization? Volume: 26 studies for hospitalization, 66 controlled trials for serious adverse events Risk of bias: Medium Evidence to answer this Key Question stem s from RCTs and case studies , but the RCTs may not have reported on the outcome of hospitalization consisten tly Consistency: Inconsistent Directness: Direct Several comparative studies if the Key Question is wide ned to include serious adverse events Precision: Precise The identified evidence has to be characterized as medium to low with regard to being able to answer the Key Question with confi dence. While several case studies reported a new hospitalization associated with the consumption of a product, including Saccharomyces, Lactobacillus, or Bacillus strains , none of the case series, CCTs, or parallel and crossover RCTs reported that a probiotics intervention led to a hospitalization in the intervention participants . A comparison of all reported hospitalizations regardless of the perceived association with the intervention treatment indicated no statistically significantly increased risk in probiotics interventions compared to the number of hospitalizations in control group participants . However, 97 the number of hospitalizations due to adverse events was explicitly reported on in only a few of the included studies, older publications may not ha ve asso ciated a hospitalization with probiotics intake, and several studies reported on participants who were already hospitalized. Only a few studies overall reported on the presence or absence of serious adverse events following the FDA definition , as ou tlined in the method section. Results for serious adverse event s varied across RCTs , sometimes favoring the probiotics group and sometimes the control group, and differences across probiotic and control groups were not statistically significant. The same result was obtained for Lactobacillus and Saccharomyces interventions, but there were too few studies ( Bifidobacterium ) or no studies ( Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Bacillus ) to analyze serious adverse events as studies did not report on the presence or absence of serious adverse events. We also investigated pertinent subgroups that were highlighted in previous chapters of the report. There was no evidence to document an increased risk of critically ill patients in probiotics groups experiencing more serious adverse events than critically ill patients in a control group; the health status of participants was not associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events relative to control group participants. Children in intervention groups were not more like ly to experience serious adverse events compared to control group children, but a formal systematic analysis of age as a moderator could not be undertaken due to the absence of reporting on the presence or absence of serious adverse events in the few identified studies in the elderly. The ratio of adverse events between intervention and control group participants also was not affected by the delivery vehicle or the route of administration. However, this finding is again based on an indirect comparison across studies; direct evidence is missing. Key Question 6. How does harm associated with Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Bacillus relate to use of concomitant antibiotics, confounding diet therapies, corticostero id use, immune suppressants, or other potential confounders? None of the studies included in this review reported a statistical interaction analysis investigating whether confounders such as concomitant antibiotics, diet therapies, corticosteroid use, use of other immune suppressants, or other variables affect s adverse events associated with probiotics . An interaction effect m ight indicate that participants on probiotics and antibiotics are more likely to experience adverse events, beyond the adverse events that can be expected in a control group of patients with similar characteristics. A potential interaction effect between probiotics and medications has been explored in the Key Question 2a and indicated a trend but no statistically significant indicatio n that intervention participants in studies with pertinent cointerventions report more adverse events than control group participants with corresponding cotreatment s. Antibiotics A substantial number of identified studies described concomitant antibiotic use ( 110/3 87). In these studies , probiotics were often given to counterbalance adverse events caused by antibiotics, for example, to prevent or treat antibiotic -associated diarrhea. We included only those studies that did report on adverse events associated with probiotics, that is, studies addressing the safety of probiotics in addition to efficacy or effectiveness outcomes. Studies reporting only on the efficacy or effectiveness of probiotics in the prevention or reduction of antibiotics- associated adverse events were outside the scope of this review. 98 In order to answer the question of whether participants using probiotics and antibiotics simultaneously makes them more at risk to experience adverse events associated with probiotics, we undertook a stratifie d analysis for all RCTs with concomitant antibiotic treatment. There was a trend but no statistically significant indication that participants in the probiotics group were more likely to experience adverse events compared to control group participants also taking antibiotics , based on the number of participants with adverse events (RR 1.07; 95% CI : 0.94, : -0.005, 0.006; p=0.855) well as according to the number of adverse incidences across groups (RR 1.13; 95% CI \u00ad 0.004, 0.014; p=0.259). Exploring the nature of the adverse events further, there was also no indication that participants experience statistically significantly more gastrointestinal adverse events compared to control group participants (RR 1.10; 95% CI : -0.003, other ( CI : : -0.005, 0.015; p=0.365). Participants were also not more likely to experience serious adverse events compared to control group participants also on antibiotic cotreatment (RR 1.04; 95% CI : 0.91, : -0.005, 0.005; p=0.972). Diet Therapies Seven studies ( five parallel and one crossover RCT) were identified that described participants on a particular diet regime (e.g., a diet based on the American Heart Association guidelines) in addition to probiotics intake. The relative risk for the number of participants with adverse events in this subgroup of studies was 1.08 (95% CI : 0.74, and the relative risk for the number of adverse event incidences in the treatment arms was 0.97 (95% CI : -0.020, 0.018; There was also no indication of differences gastrointestinal complaints (1.10; 95% CI -0.016, 0.036; p=0.449) compared to control group. How ever, it should be noted that the stratified analyses were based on between three and seven RCTs only, due to the small number of studies reporting conc omitant diet therapies . Most individual trials reported either no adverse events or similar incidences across groups. Corticosteroid Use There were 2 6 studies that reported using corticosteroids in conjunction with an intervention of probiotic organisms. None of these studies reported an interaction analysis or related the adverse events experienced to the use of confounding corticosteroids with probiotics. In order to answer the question of whether participants using probiotics and corticosteroids simulta neously makes them more at risk to experience adverse events associated with probiotics , we undertook a stratified analysis for all RCTs with concomitant corticosteroid treatment. There was no indication that participants in the probiotics group were more likely to experience adverse events compared to control group participants also taking corticosteroids, based on the number of 99 participants with adverse events (RR 1.04; 95% CI : well as according to the number of adverse incidences across groups (RR -0.021, 0.021; p=0.986). Exploring the nature of the adverse events further, there was a trend but no statistically significant indication that participants experience statistically significantly more gastrointestinal adverse events compared to control group participants (RR 1.11; 95% CI : -0.010, 0.232; p=0.448). Participants were also not more likely to experience serious adverse events compared to control group participants also on corticosteroid cotreatment (RR Immune Suppressants Eight studies , including three case studies, were identified that reported on pa tients using probiotics while taking immune suppressant medications several studies described patients with ulcerative colitis . Two case reports in patients using immune suppressants to control an underlying condition described fungemia infections (Bassetti, 1998; Zunic, 1991), and one case report reported an abscess potentially associated with Lactobacillus rhamnosus . One of the case series in patients on immune suppressant medications noted a patient with an erythema around the anus (Benchimol, 2004), and two other case series reported several gastrointestinal incidences in patients with ulcerative colitis (Huynh, One RCT in patients with atopic dermatitis listed abdominal pain as an adverse event with 2/24 in the treatment group compared to 1/24 in the prebiotics control group (Passeron, 2006). An RCT in transplant patients noted diarrhea, abdominal pain, and abdominal cramps similarly distributed across treatment arms (Rayes, 2005). Tursi (2010) reported 8/65 adverse events such as abdominal bloating with or without discomfort compared to 9/66 patients with adverse events in the control group in a n RCT in patients with ulcerative colitis No other pertinent confounder was identified in this review that clearly warranted further investigation. Summary and Strength of Evidence Key Question 6 How does harm associated with Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Bacillus relate to use of concomitant antib iotics, confounding diet therapies, corticosteroid use, immune suppressants, or other potential confounders? Volume: Indirect comparisons are based on 387 studies, no evidence from individual interaction studies Risk of bias : Medium Evidence to answer th is Key Question stem s from RCTs and case studies Consistency: Inconsistent Directness: Indirect 100 Question can be analyzed only through cross- study comparisons or subgroup analyses Precision: Precise There is insufficient evidence to answer this Key Ques tion with confidence. We did not identify studies meeting the review inclusion criteria that report ed statistical interactions between concomitant antibiotics, diet therapies, corticosteroid use , or immune suppressants. Although the risk of adverse events in general might be higher in participants on multiple medications, in subgroup analyse s of studies in which the intervention participants as well as the control group participants received antibiotics or corticosteroid s, no statistically significantly increased risk of adverse events was identified among intervention participants. Across RCTs, there was no evidence for a statistically significant interaction between these medications and the risk for adverse events being increased in the treatment group r elative to the control group. We identified only a few studies with concomitant diet therapies , and studies in participants using immune suppressants were also largely absent in the existing literature . The few studies identified did not indicate an increa sed risk of adverse events , but rare events are difficult to assess, and the existing evidence base is not sufficient to draw conclusive conclusions. 101 Discussion Results Su mmary The review demonstrates that there is a large volume of literature on probi otics . However, the literature provided only limited evidence to address the questions the review set out to answer. The search of 10 databases combined with reference screening of included studies and pertinent reviews identified 11,201 publications, and 622 studies were included in the review. Of these 622 studies, 235 studies made only nonspecific safety statements (\"well tolerated\") , and the remaining 387 studies reported the presence or absence of one or more specific adverse events . The r eview includes a large number of randomized controlled trial ( RCTs ); however, the majority of these were not designed to monitored adverse events but primarily tested the efficacy of probiotics in managing, treating, or preventing clinical symptoms. The quality of inc luded studies varied within study design categories; only a minority of trials reported adequate randomization methods, concealment of treatment group allocation, and blinding of outcome assessors to the treatment group ; and studies were not powered to ass ess adverse events . Adverse events were poorly documented and publications seldom stated what parameters were monitored. Further, in the majority of included studies, interventions were poorly documented, lacking detail , for example, on the specific probiotic strain that was administered as well as the dose and viability . Identified c ase studies indicated that fungemia , bacteremia, and sepsis may be associated with administered probiotic organisms. None of the identified case series, controlled clinical trials ( CCTs ), parallel and crossover RCTs reported an infections caused by the administered probiotic strains. However, these studies did not monitor routinely for such infections ; reported adverse events were primarily gastrointestinal in nature. In parall el RCTs , no statistically increased risk for adverse events in the quantity of adverse events w as observed, analyzing the number of participants with adverse events and reported adverse event incidences per treatment group. Exploring the nature of reported events in the literature , we found that adverse events were gastrointestinal in nature, addressed infections and infestations, or addressed other adverse events . In none of the different types of adverse events did parallel RCT show a statistically signif icant ly increased risk for adverse events in intervention participants compared to control. Across studies, there was also no statistically significantly increased risk of serious adverse events associated with probiotic product use. Long- term effects are largely unknown as very few existing studies report on followup periods of one year or more. Stratifying s tudies by probiotic genus, it was apparent that the existing literature covers primarily the gen us Lactobacillus , alone or in combination with other genera, most frequently Bifidobacterium . There was some evidence from a metaregression that indicated Streptococcus interventions may be associated with a larger number of adverse events compared to other genera, but evidence from direct, head- to-head comp arisons is lacking. Stratifying RCTs that used each genus exclusively, no statistically significant difference between intervention and control group participants was observed for any of the six genera. However, published reports on the genera Enterococcus , Bacillus , Streptococcus are largely absent from the literature. Saccharomyces interventions and Bifidobacterium interventions were also rare, and a substantial proportion of studies used blends of probiotic organisms. 102 The review aimed to address a large number of participant and intervention variables and their effect on safety. Direct evidence comparing intervention factors is largely absent from the existing literature. Few studies directly compared the safety of different product or participant charact eristics. Indirect comparisons indicated that effects of delivery vehicles should be investigated further. Analyzing participant factors such as health status showed that c ase studies described adverse events in patients with existing health concerns, ofte n already hospitalized when potentially probiotics associated infections occurred . However , RCTs did not indicate a statistically significantly increased risk of adverse events in healthy, medium- risk, or critically ill participant groups compared to control. Scope and Limitations This evidence report considers a large number of studies and addresses a large number of research questions. Unlike the majority of existing reviews , this evidence report considers only adverse events reported in studies of probiotics, and does not cover efficacy or effectiveness questions for the management , prevention, or treat ment of clinical symptoms or other indications for using probiotic products . For a risk -benefit analys is, both aspects would need to be considered . A substantial number of reviews summarizing individual studies of effects of probiotics have been published. However, existing reviews focus on selected interventions, selected probiotic genera, selected patient groups, or selected 2007). This evidence report has a broader scope, and due to the large number of included studies, allows unique statistical analyses. Adverse events reported in intervention studies of probiotic organisms are largely rare events encounter ed by only a small number of participants. Thus, large sample sizes are necessary to be able to detect any statistically significant incidence rates of such adverse events. Search This review aimed to capture the safety of probiotics, in particular the saf ety of Lactobacillus , Bifidobacterium Saccharomyces , Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Bacillus used as probiotic agents. The search strategy was primarily designed to capture all explicitly identified probiotic studies, and steps were taken to ensure the completeness of the body of evidence of probiotic literature. We identified a large number of publications on probiotics and carefully screened full paper copies of all publications that m ight contain information on the safety of probiotics. Other studies that investigated the same genera in ways that resembled their use as probiotic agents but did not label their intervention s as probiotic studies were not excluded but were also not sought systematically as outlined in the search strategy justification , and no claim 103 of completeness is made. These studies were primarily identified through reference mining , that is, scanning the bibliographies of included studies and pertinent review articles. This review was not restricted to particular species, strain s, patient group, clinical field s, settings , or study design, and the sought interventions included genera such as Bacillus with known pathogenic properties, hence the decision to restrict the search to probiotic studies rather than expanding it to the wider literature on the individual bacteria and yeast strains. Judging from our experience, future reviews targeted towards more specific research questions should use a combination of search terms covering both the term \"probiotic\" and the gen us to identify those studies that used a particular strain as a probiotic agent. This review adopted a thorough process of identifying information on the safety of probiotics by screening full paper copies of empirical studies on probiotics, regardless of whether the safety of probiotics was mentioned in the summary of the article, that is, the title or abstract of the publication. Initial experiments with search filters have shown that screening studies at the title or abstract level would have resulted in missing a large proportion of the pertinent literature . The majority of included studies w ere not tagged by databases as including safety information, the title and the abstract gave no indication that adverse events would be addressed in the publication, and in the overwhelming majority of studies other than case reports, safety was not the main aim of the publication. The review focuses on published literature, and a substantial number of studies of probiotics have been published in scientific journals. However, there may also be a substantial number of unpublished studies, most likely from manufacturers of probiotics. This factor, combined with the fact that we could not be certain studies that failed to mention adverse events indeed had no adverse events, limits the utility of the review as a basis for true risk -benefit analysis of probiotics. Probiotics This exploratory review on the safety of probiotics lists the reported presence and absence of adverse events for interventions that used Lactobacillus , Bifidobacterium , Sac charomyces , Streptococcus, Enterococcus, as probiotic agents. The imbalance of genera in the included studies (favoring Lactobacillus alone and in combination with Bifidobacterium ) presumably reflect s the research conducted to date. We adopted a very inclusive definition of probiotics. H owever, there is an ongoing debate about whether yogurt should be considered a probiotic product, since yogurt contains live bacteria ( e.g., Guarner, Perdigon, Corthier, et al. , 2005) of genera that are associated with probiotic properties, and the debate also extends to whether there is any reason to think adverse events need to be monitored for yogurt and lactic acid bacteria products (e.g., MacGregor, Smith, Thakker and Kinsella, 2002). For this review, yogurt studies that did not explicitly report the addition of a probiotic agent, that is, a strain in addition to the yogurt starter culture, were excluded . A distinct limitation of this review is th at most of the identified studies provided insuffi cient information on the intervention, that is, a clear description of the microbes that were included in the investigated probiotic product. The lack of identification or proper classification of the admin istered probiotic organisms is a safety concern in itself. A large number of published studies did not report the strain of the probiotic agent included in the preparation. Given that the efficacy of probiotics is often considered strain specific, the informational value of these studies 104 has to be questioned. Lack of documentation is hindering efficacy as well as safety evaluations (EFSA, 2009; Shane, 2010) and limits overviews necessary for consumers and policymake rs. A further limitation is the uncertain reliability of the reported product details. For this literature review , we rely on the information reported by the study authors. Very few studies reported using accepted methods (or any methods) to test the cont ent of preparations given to participants . The exact organisms as well as any contaminants present in the preparations are pertinent information. For example, included studies indicated that the species used was Lactobacillus sporogenes however; the species designation Lactobacillus sporogenes is now considered an invalid name for Bacillus coagulans (Becker, 1950; De Clerck, 2004; Jung, 2009). Similarly, some reported on Str eptococcus faecium and Streptococc us faecalis, which have been transferred to the genus Enterococcus (Schleifer, 1984). A study published in 2006 conducted a survey of commercial probiotic strains and found that 28 percent of the strains intended for use in humans as probiotics were misidentified at the genus or species level (Huys, 2006). Other reports show that products can contain more species than noted on the product labels (Marcobal, 2008; Underwood, 2009). Also, over the time span covered by our literature search , many of the employed organisms may have undergone mutations (spontaneous or otherwise), identification techniques have improved (e.g., revealing them to be less similar to a more familiar strain or to belong to a different genus than previously thought), and taxonomic name changes were introduced (see, e.g., Masco, No 2009). Finally , we identified a large number of studies that gave a blend of different probiotic organisms to participants . These studies individually do not permit to attribute reported harms to a particular genus, species, or strain. Metaregressions can to some extent trace effects across studies, but this process cannot replace adequate study designs to investigate the safety of probiotic strains. Intervention Studies This report was explicitly limited to assessing the outcomes of interventions (as opposed to merely passive or accidental exposure). We identified a large number o f intervention studies in the international literature assessing the effects of Lactobacillus , Bifidobacterium , Saccharomyces , agents. A number of publications exists that systematically collated example cases of fungemia associated with Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( e.g., Munoz, 2005), or infections associated with Lactobacillus (e.g., Aguirre, 1993; Husni, 1997), or Bifidobacteri um (e.g., Bourne, 1978). However, we considered only those case descriptions that reported a preceding intervention, that is, the purposeful use of probiotics. This limitation also pertains to reports from hospitals describing out break s of fungemia such as reports on an intensive care unit (ICU) where patients did not purposefully consume probiotics, but the yeast was reported to linger in the ICU (Cassone, 2003). On e of the included case studies (Perapoch, 2000) also reported on an infant who appeared to have contracted an infection from an infant treated with Saccharomyces cerevisiae who later developed fungemia; hence, spread of infections should also be monitored in research studies. The review considered studies without study design restrictions and it includes a large number of different study designs such as parallel and crossover RCTs, CCTs, case series , and case studies. However, the literature search di d not identify any observational cohort studies comparing two cohorts or retrospective case-control studies on the safety (or even the efficacy) 105 of organisms used for their probiotic properties; all observational data came from case series following only one intervention group and case studies. The reason for th is lack of large -scale observational studies of probiotic safety is unclear but may be the result of a general presumption of probiotic safety on the part of epidemiologists (and the failure to implicate them as the cause of any particular conditions). A 2002 epidemiological study addressing a similar question assessed changes in the incidence of Lactobacillus -associated bacteremia in Finland after a rapid increase in the use of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG as a probiotic agent. The study found no increase in the incidence of Lactobacillus -associated bacteremia in the population, although a small proportion of isolates matched the strain of the probiotic agent, using the typing technology available at th at time (Salminen, 2002). Safety The review identified a large number of relevant publications addressing the safety of probiotic products. For RCTs , we identified a similar volume of publications that addressed the potential efficacy of probiotic preparations but not the ir safety. It is not possible to extrapolate from the lack of mention of adverse events t hat no adverse events occurred in interventions (e.g., the adverse events associated with a particular trial might be reported in an accompanying or subsequent, not- yet-published, article). Even fewer RCTs reported on the presence and the absence of specif ic adverse events. The review identified a large number of publications that ma de vague safety statements such as \"the intervention was well tolerated\" and \"there were no adverse events. \" We compiled these vague references to safety to allow a complete overview o f the existing literature , but the se studies were analyzed separately from studies with more specific statements. This group of studies reported no information on what was monitored or how \"well tolerated\" was defined. For an evidence report such as this whose purpose is to synthesize the evidence , these studies are of little informational value. When publications reported that there were no adverse events , we did not make inferences from this statement to specific outcomes. Although it may appear plausible to assume that this means no death or hospitalizations occurred, this assumption is very problematic and should not replace actual empirical evidence on the safety of probiotics. The safety of probiotics has only recently been considered as an iss ue warranting further investigation (Liong, 2008) . Older publications may not have thought to associat e such harms with an intervention considered completely harmless. In order to advance the empirical evidence on the safety of probiotics, studies should monitor and report the presence and also the absence of specific harms. For this review we extracted all reported adverse events, regardless of whether the authors of the publication considered these in their summary statement regarding the safety of probiotics. We also included outcomes regardless of the author's assurance that the event was unrelated to the intervention. Such judgments are difficult to make and may change with increasing knowledge of the safety of probiotics. Very few publications appear to have addressed the assessment of the strength of association between adverse event and intervention systematically , as reported for example in Gibson (2009). Safety r eviews on probiotics have focus ed on various aspects of safety such as toxicity, the potential for translocation , and antibiotic resistance or other virulence factors (Ishibashi, 2001; Sanders, 2010; Yazdankhah, 2009). This report operationalized safety as the presence or absence of unintended adverse health events in probiotics interventions for human participants. We 106 document the quantity, quality, and nature of adverse events reported in research studies using probiotics to reduce risk of and prevent or treat disease in vivo. Efficacy studies for which the efficacy outcome was the mitigation of an adverse event (e.g., efficacy of probiotics in preventing or treating antibiotic-induced diarrhea or other negative health outcomes) were excluded unless (1) the outcome was actually exacerbated in the probiotic treatment group compared to baseline or to a control group and this outcome was one of the main safety findings of the paper (stated in the abstract of the publication, so- called treatment failures); or (2) the safety of the probiotics, themselves, was also explicitly addressed in the publication. This operationalization is not without problems but it is a pragmatic solution adopted in other recent overviews of the safety literature (e.g., Pitrou, Boutron, Ahmad & Ravand, 2009). Particular outcomes addressed in this review warrant further investigation as a risk -benefit analysis in a review that includes all studies reporting on a particular outcome such as all -cause mortality . Such a review would need to include all studies addressing the outcome, regardless of whether the outcome was considered a measure of efficacy or an unintended effect. Key Questions Key Question 1. Wh at is the evidence that the active and lyophilized forms of probiotics (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Bacillus ) as single ingredients or in combination with other probiotics or prebiotics in all delivery vehicles (and formulations) when used to cure, treat, mitigate or prevent a disease or reduce disease risk are safe in the short term? Long term? The question of whether probiotic interventions are safe cannot be answered with sufficient confidence based on the existing literature. The existing literature includes primarily the genera Lactobacillus , alone and in combination with other genera, often Bifidobacterium ; adverse events associated with other genera are not well documented. Case studies indicated t hat primarily fungemia, but also bacteremia, and incidences o f sepsis have been linked to administered probiotic organisms. Although the confidence of matching strains has only recently been improved through DNA-based matching methods, the existing reports indicate that an association between administered probiotic strains and observed infections must be considered (Liong, 2008). RCTs, CCTs, and case series did not report that they routinely monitor for the kinds of infections identified in case reports. This is particularly distressing as the identified case studies span a long period; t he infectious potential of probiotic organisms is not a recent observation (Jensen, 1976; Richard, 1988). Most c ontrolled trials did not state what harms were monitored, and the safety of the probiotic products was not addressed systematically. Poor reporting of adverse events is not specific to studies on probiotic products but a general concern of intervention studies (Ioannidis, 2004). None of the identified case series, C CTs, or parallel and crossover RCTs reported an infections caused by the administered probiotic strains. However, these studies did not monitor routinely for such infections. The absence of reliable evidence on adverse events should not be mistaken for evidence of the absence of adverse events. The adverse events reported in RCTs in 107 the current literature do not suggest a widespread risk, but future studies that explicitly monitor for the safety issues of concern are needed to quantify the actual risk of sp ecific adverse events in intervention studies. Freque ntly reported individual adverse events were deaths that occurred during the study followup period; many gastrointestinal incidences such as diarrhea, constipation, or nausea; and respiratory infections. These types of outcomes were reported for both study arms , participants using probiotics as well as participants in control groups. Across studies most incidences were distributed evenly across treatment groups ; nonetheless , there were individual studies such as the PROPATRIA trial reported by Besselink et al. (2008 ), a study of failed effectiveness reported a higher mortality rate in the probiotic treatment group than in the control group in patients with acute pancreatitis, which indicates that individual outcomes such as mortality should be monitored. In particular , as the mechanism of action must be investigated further, the study reported no incidences of infections caused by the administered probiotics organis ms (Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains). In a further publication, this mortality rate was determined to be increased in those taking probiotics who had organ failure, as compared to those who did not (Bessel ink, 2009). The analysis of i ndividual outcomes also suggests that treatment failures should be highlighted in current research. Although treatment failures were not considered per se for this review, failed efficacy was sometimes considered a safety concern (Besselink, 2008; Boyle, 2008) and a central outcome of the study. Individual outcomes such as mortality should be assessed in a risk-benefit analysis that includes the outcome regardless of whether it was inve stigated as a safety concern or efficacy measure (i.e., where probiotics were given to reduce mortality) . To approach the question of safety of probiotics, we also systematically investigated the quantity of adverse events reported in probiotics studies. This information is meaningful only in comparison to a control group, a comparable group with similar patient characteristics, co\u00adinterventions, and other similar circumstances that permit investigation of whether adverse events are increased with probiotic s use. We investigated two alternative measures, the number of patients with adverse events in each treatment group and the number of adverse- event incidences per treatment group. Each measure has inherent advantages and disadvantages , and the measures are not identical, as a single participant can experience multiple adverse events. Across all individual studies and identified adverse events , parallel RCTs did not indicate a statistically significantly increased risk of adverse events in either of the comp lementary measures. However, i t has to be considered, though, that the existing literature is dominated by Lactobacillus -based interventions, both in combination with several other genera or alone. Finally , the current literature also does not permit statements on the long- term safety of probiotics. With few exceptions, the existing literature reports on short- and medium- term use of probiotics assessed for a short or medium- term followup period. Research on probiotics has increased dramatically in recent years and studies in the near future may report more information on long- term effects of probiotics. Key Question 2. What are characteristics and associations of the reported harms in Question 1? The reported adverse events were primarily gastrointestinal in nature, others concerned infections and infestations, and a large group of studies did not fit any particular category in the published system used to classify adverse events (DHHS, 2009). While the case studies primarily 108 reported infections suspected or confirmed to be caused by an administered probiotic organism, the majority of other studies reported gastrointestinal incidences. In the included RCTs , there was no indication that participants using probiotic organisms have a higher risk of experiencing gastrointestinal adverse events than those not using them and this was also the case for infections and infestations and all other reported adverse events across studies. Studies rarely reported efforts to monitor harms specific to probiotic product interventions, including infections due to the administered strains. Hence, evaluations of the safety might change with future, more targeted, assessment of adverse events (Liong, 2008). There is a lack of studies investigating potential interactions between probiotics and other, concomitantly administered, medications. The descriptions of cases experiencing serious adverse events suggest that either multiple medications or the underlying condition may have contributed to the severe adverse events reported but studies systematically addressing interaction effects are lacking. We identified only a very small number of studies addressing acquired antibiotic resistance as a patient outcome with clinical relevance. Evidence for potential harms came from case studies in patients with multiple morbidities. Reported resistance perta ined only to selected antibiotics. However, it has to be noted that w e restricted the current review to patient outcomes, only where antibiotic resistance and translocation were described as clinical adverse events were these eligible for inclusion in the review. This excluded , for example, in vitro and animal research on the potential, or lack of potential, for antibiotic resistance and translocation that has been published for the investigated genera (Abe, 2010; Corthesy, 2007; Ishibashi, 2001). Key Question 3. What is the evidence that harms of Lactobacillus , Bifidobacterium , Saccharomyces , Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Bacillus differ by product and delivery characteristics? We set out to answer a large number of research questions related to the interventions and delivery characteristics. However, identified s tudies lacked detail in their description of administered probiotic organisms. Many studies did not specify which probiotic strains were investigated , nor was there indication that intervention preparations were tested for identity of the included organisms, viability, or contaminants. The question of genus- specific safety profiles is not easy to answer with the existing literature. The review included pr obiotic organisms that were very different in nature (bacterial as well as yeast strains) with different histories and research experiences of using the genera as probiotic products (e.g., Lactobacillus versus Enterococcus ). The number of identified fungem ia case reports associated with of Saccharomyces boulardii [cerevisiae] outnumbered case reports of infections reported for the bacterial strains. However, RCTs, CCTs , and case series investigated primarily Lactobacillus, alone or in combination with Bifid obacterium strain interventions; the available evidence, including reports of the absence and the presence of adverse events as well as effectiveness studies, is very unbalanced across genera. The kind of postmarket reports of adverse events that participants m ight encounter when using probiotic products had to be elicited from studies that often investigate d products that included different genera or g ave different probiotic genera for very different purposes, to different participant groups, in different doses and potencies. Very few studies provided head -to\u00ad head comparisons of different genera. For the included RCTs, w e undertook stratified analyses for each genus in studies that used organisms from one genus only, for example, all studies using 109 exclusiv ely Lactobacillus organisms. Stratified analyses by probiotic genus showed no increased risk of adverse events for any of the genera in studies using the genus in question exclusively. In addition, we undertook a metaregression and investigated each genus as a moderator in studies that used a particular genus alone or in combination with other genera (e.g., all studies including a Lactobacillus strain). There was some indication that interventions including Streptococcus strain s showed a higher risk of adve rse events compared to the other genera. However, t his result was based on a small number of studies given the paucity of studies using genera other than Lactobacillus and direct evidence is missing. Included studies used unique interventions that comprise d a large number of different species and strains to investigate the efficacy , and in some cases the safety, for use as probiotic agents. Typically , there were t oo few comparable studies to enable individual safety statements for species or strain s: many s tudies used interventions that included more than one probiotic organism so that it was not possible to link encountered adverse events to specific species or strains , and as outlined before, the documentation and validation of the interventions as well as the monitored adverse events w ere lacking . Other factors , such as a history of safe use of species in the food production, data on the prevalence of opportunistic infections, or reports of resistance to antibiotic or antifungal medications , may be con sidered to determine the potential for safe use . (see e.g., EFSA opinion, 2007; [Cote, 2006.]). However, these factors do not preclude the occurrence of rare adverse events , and such known properties of genera or speci es are only useful if there is evidence to suggest that all strains within the genus or within a species can be expected to behave similarly. Assuming that because a genus or individual species has low toxicity , no strain of the genus or species an d no intervention including organisms of that genus or species can cause adverse events in intervention studies appears to be an overgeneralization. There is also a lack of studies directly comparing product characteristics such as the mode of delivery. Indirect c omparisons across the RCTs identified in this review indicated that the potential effect of different delivery vehicles should be investigated further. Subgroups indicated more adverse event incidences in the treatment group when probiotics were taken in a yogurt or other dairy product than when taken in any other vehicle. It must be kept in mind that no study actually compared adverse events between a yogurt/other dairy vehicle and any other vehicle within the same study; nevertheless, there are alternativ e explanations for such an observation. Probiotic organisms might maintain greater viability in dairy than nondairy vehicles, or the adverse events are actually attributable to lactose intolerance. Given that many consumers consume probiotics as part of dairy or yogurt products, this effect should be further investigated in direct comparisons. The possibility that the use of a particular food as a vehicle for probiotic organisms might alter their viability (and therefore the potential efficacy and toxicity) has been explored in a number of studies (Champagne, 2005), and some have reported that Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG isolated from 15 different manufactured food products (carriers) showed strain differences that could affect both efficacy and safety (Grzeskowiak, 2010). The only included studies that compared the form of probiotic organisms directly compared viable and heat-killed organisms. Heat-killed organisms are not included in prominent definitions of probiotics; hence, this comparison is of minor interest. There was no indication that active forms were associated with a higher number of adverse events. The characterization of organisms was too poor in included studies to allow a systematic investigation of the influence of the form. Also seldom tested or reported was the viability of the administered organisms: Considering that probiotics are live organisms and that they presumably need to remain live to be 110 fully functional, it is concerning that few studies demonstrated that they were indeed able to maintain the evaluated organisms in a live and robust state. Related to this concern, Bacillus species are capable of forming spores, which would affect the count of viable organisms in a preparation. Furthermore, because several of the genera of interest are primarily anaerobic, exposure to oxygen during storage could easily affect viability. Another factor that might lower the potency of probiotic products is the failure to c onsider the potential for cryogenic damage during lyophilization and/or storage and to compensate by adding a cryoprotectant (see e.g., Savini, 2010). We did not identify conclusive evidence in the existing literature showing that interventions with a mixture of different organisms reported more adverse events than studies using one probiotic strain only or that synbiotics (mixtures of prebiotics and probiotics) differ from probiotics; however, there is a lack of direct comparisons. Although the risk of adverse events (as well as the efficacy ) is not necessarily comparable across species and strains, direct head -to\u00ad head comparisons are largely absent in the literature and in practice, probiotic interventions often included several different probiotics genera, species , and strains. Key Question 4. How do the harms of Lactobacillu s, Bifidobacterium , Saccharomyces , Streptococcus, Enterococcus, based on (a) dose (cfu); (b) timing; (c) mode of administration (e.g., catheter); (d) age (all ages, including infants), gender, ethnicity, disease or immunologic status of the patient; (e) relationship to efficacy? Only a few primary studies explored the effect of intervention and participant characteristics on safety. Both the variation in definitions of high and low dose across published studies and other factors such as the inherent differences in the compared organisms as outlined previously precluded a systematic evaluation of a dose-response relationship. Very few published studies were identified that investigated the effects of long -term use of probiotics, that is, in tervention durations of 1 year or longer; information on the safety of long- term use is lacking. Given the current research interest (Shane, 2010) studies will hopefully provide needed evidence on long- term interventions. There were few descriptions of the time of onset of harms relative to treatment and the further clinical course of adverse events. In the few studies that reported on the time of onset of gastrointestinal effects, most effects were observed within in the first 3 days of treatment. The onset of infections tended to occur 1 to several weeks after initiation of probiotics use ; however, this information is primarily based on case studies and was not systematically reported. A further pertinent question may b e the optimal time for administering probiotics, that is, early to prevent, rather than aiming to treat or improve particular conditions, which may be associated with the risk-benefit ratio of interventions (Arciero, 2010; Sanders, 2010). In indirect comparisons across all identified RCTs in this review , we found no evidence that a particular mechanism or route of administration of probiotic organisms (e.g., through enteral feeding) was associated with an increased risk of an adverse event relative to a control group. In the literature, serio us adverse events associated with probiotic use have been linked to catheter use (e.g., Sanders, 2010). However, t he route of administration is closely linked to the health status of participants. 111 With regard to the health status of participants, there was some indication that health status is associated with the risk for an adverse event when using probiotics. The majority of case studies reporting serious adverse events described a critically ill patient or someone suffering from multiple morbidities whe n they contracted a serious infection potentially caused by probiotic organisms. There was some indication in the metaregressions that health status may predict an increased risk of adverse events associated with probiotic organisms. However, a subgroup analysis of all controlled trials enrolling critically ill participants did not show a statistically significantly increased risk of experiencing adverse events for participants using probiotic organisms compared to control group participants with similar pa tient characteristics. Critically ill patients may be more prone to experience adverse events; however, these were not associated with the use of probiotics; adverse events were equally distributed across treatment groups. Further large controlled studies are needed to identify any increased risk for rare but pertinent adverse events , and the risk-benefit ratio should be considered (also Whelan, 2010). For studies enrolling patients with compromised health , it would appear appropriate to use a data monitor ing committee. A study by the Society for Clinical Trials' DAMOCLES Study Group found that only about 25 percent of articles presenting the main results of clinical trials mentioned having used a data monitoring committee to ensure the appropriate collection of data throughout the trial (Sydes, 2004). Such committees would also be helpful in standardizing the collection of adverse event data in large, well -powered trials as well as in some smaller trials in populations of interest; a data monitoring working group has provided a set of guidelines (STC, 2006). To assess the role of the age in the safety of probiotics, w e stratified studie s according to the age of participants and undertook separate analyses for studies in children, adults, or elderly participant s. The stratified analyses did not indicate an increased risk of adverse events in any of the subgroups associated with the use of probiotics compared to corresponding control group participants. However it has to be noted that very few studies were identified that reported on elderly participants. The identified case studies described more male than female patients . In the RCTs , we investigated the results of subgroups in female only and male only studies as well as analyzing the percent of female participants as a factor in a meta- analysis. In these indirect comparisons across RCTs , we found no indication that encountered adverse events relative to control group incidences depend on the gender of the participants. The included studies did not provide enough information to investigate whether probiotic safety is associated with racial/ ethnic characteristics . It should be kept in mind that the majority of included studies w ere conducted in European countries where ethnic characteristics are rarely assessed in research studies . The research field need s to advance much further in order to be able to answer such specific questions regardi ng the safety of probiotics; such evidence is not available for other more established interventions (such as antibiotics use) either. In total, 59 percent of included studies were explicitly described as effective by the study authors for the various applications of probiotic use under investigation. We found no indication that the efficacy of an intervention was related to the number of encountered adverse events across all included RCTs. 112 Key Question 5. How often does harm associated with Lactobacillus , Bifidobacterium , Saccharomyces , Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Bacillus lead to hospital admission or lengthened hospitalization? While several case studies reported a new hospitalization potentially associated with the consumption of a product including Saccharomyces, Lactobacillus, or Bacillus strains , none of the case series, CCTs, and parallel and crossover RCTs reported that a probiotics intervention led to a hospitalization in the intervention participants. A comparison of all reported hospitalizations regardless of the perceived association with the intervention treatment indicated no statistically significant risk in probiotics interventions compared to the number of hospitalizations in control group participants . However, the number of hospitalizations due to adverse events was only explicitly reported on in a few of the included studies. Older publications may not have associated a hospitalization with probiotics intake , and several studies were in participants already hospitalized. As outlined previously, the safety of probiotic products has only recently been considered as an issue warranting further investigation (Liong, 2008). A proportion of included studies reported on the prese nce or absence of serious adverse events following the Food and D rug A dministration definition . Results for serious adverse event varied across RCTs, sometimes favoring the probiotics group and sometimes the control group, and differences across probiotic and control group were not statistically significant. The same result was obtained for Lactobacillus and Saccharomyces interventions, but there were too few studies ( Bifidobacterium ) or no studies ( Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Bacillus ) in order to analyze serious adverse events for other genera, as studies did not report on the presence or absence of serious adverse events. The reporting of adverse events appear s to have improved in recent years, presumably due to stricter guidelines and higher standards imposed by journals, for example, making it mandatory to report on adverse events when reporting the results of RCTs (e.g., Item 19 of the CONSORT statement, \"All important harms or unintended effects in each group\" ). Relevant to this review is that the rep orting of the presence and absence of infections has increased in particular, possibly a reaction in part to the PROPATRIA trial reported by Besselink et al. (2008). We also investigated pertinent subgroups that were of particular interest to this evidence report. Most notably, we did not find evidence that health -compromised patients were at increased risk of experiencing more serious adverse events than health -compromised control group participants . However, it has to be taken into account that the monito ring and reporting of adverse events is lacking, existing interventions were again primarily Lactobacillus interventions, and future assessments may come to different conclusions as the evidence base improves. Key Question 6. How does harm associated with Lactobacillus , Bifidobacterium , Saccharomyces , Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Bacillus use of concomitant antibiotics, confounding diet therapies, corticosteroid use, immune suppressants, or other potential confounders? Multivariate analyses in primary research studies are suitable to systematically trace interactions between cointerventions and probiotic use. In studies where some of the participants use these cointerventions while others do not, this factor and its effect on the study outcome can be investigated. We did not identify studies meeting the review inclusion criteria that reported 113 statistical interactions between concomitant antibiotics, diet therapies, corticosteroid use , or immune suppressants and probiotics. Although the risk of adverse events in general might be higher in participants on multiple medications, the crucial issue for this Key Question is whether participants in probiotics interventions are more likely to experience adverse events compared to corresponding control group participants. Interactions between comorbidities and cotreatment s are complex research questions (Fitzgerald , 2010). For example, we might assume an interaction between corticosteroids and probiotics when studies in participant samples using corticosteroids report a higher risk ratio of adverse events than other studies. In subgroup analyses of identified studi es in which the intervention participants as well as the control group participants received corticosteroid s, we found no statistically significantly increased risk of adverse events for intervention participants compared to control. Probiotic interventio ns have been the focus of much research interest for the prevention of side effects associated with antibiotics (Abernethy, 2008; Zou, 2009). While efficacy studies for the prevention of side effects were not eligible for inclusion in the review, we included those studies that addressed side effects of probiotics in addition to side effects of antibiotics where feasible, through the design and t he adverse event monitoring of the study. Across RCTs, there was no evidence for a statistically significant ly increased risk of adverse events for intervention participants compared to controls or an interaction between antibiotics and probiotics. We identified only a few studies with concomitant diet therapies . Studies in participants using immune suppressants were also largely absent in the existing literature and patients on immune suppressants were systematically excluded from a number of RCTs . The ex isting evidence base is not sufficient to draw any meaningful conclusions from adverse events observed in the few studies that addressed these patients . 114 Future Research Our search of the published literature on probiotics failed to uncover answers to several of the questions posed by the sponsors and identified little information on several of the organisms of interest. P erforming a formal gap analysis was beyond the scope of the review; however a major aim of these recommendations for future research must be to fill in the research gaps we identified. Monitoring and r eporting . Future studies should describe the intervention and the results of interventions in more detail . This improved description would entail , first of all , documenting the investigated product with regard to the genus, species, and strain. As technology and methods develop, this should also entail a more reliable, DNA- based validation of the characteristics of the included micro organisms, that is, the valid identification of the studied organism and the purity or the identification of all included microorganism in the study product. There is a need for more reliable information on the identity, potency, and viability of the included microorganisms given to participants at the time of the intervention as this may depend on the storage and delivery vehicles chosen for interventions. Future studies should describe which adverse events were monitored to allow a clearer overview of the presence and absence of adverse events in probiotics studi es, in order to quantify the risk of adverse events for future intervention participants. The reporting of adverse events should follow reporting guidelines such as the extension of the CONSORT statement for harms (Ioannidis, 2004). In addition, there are comprehensive systems for cataloging adverse event s such as the C TCAE system . The mention of adverse event s almost in passing, as is typical for the existing literature , is hindering knowledge accumulation. Generally, it should be standard to monitor and report on adverse events in interventions; general research into microbial behavior and early toxicity inve stigations cannot replace empirical evidence for the presence and absence of adverse events in studies aiming to reduce risk for, prevent, or treat diseases in human participants. Study designs . Long -term effects of probiotics interventions are largely unknown and should be considered in future studies; despite the large number of publications on probiotics, there is a lack of long- term assessment studies. There is also a need to evaluate the long -term use of probiotics, that is, intervention durations of more than a few weeks , as are currently typical . In addition, t he current literature is dominated by clinical research studies ; large cohort studies following populations who have self-selected to use probiotics as dietary supplements or food components are needed to fully understand the effectiveness and safety of probiotics. Population surveillance studies and case- control studies are largely absent from the literature. Research questions . Studies are needed to explore potential adverse events associated with interventions that include the genera Enterococcus and Bacillus , and possibly the use of some Streptococcus species , as well as the use of Saccharomyces in some patient groups; the majority of existing studies report on Lactobacillus , alone or in combination with other genera, most commonly Bifidobacterium strains. In addition, it is possible that safety results differ not only by genus but also by species or strains; hence, all probiotics research studies should report adverse events and not rely on results obtained with other species or strains. 115 The current literature rarely reports assessment efforts to monitor harms specific to probiotics, and more targeted assessments may change our understanding of the safety of probiotics from what is presented in this evidence report. The harms assessment should consider safety issues warranting further investigation as documented in this review. This process would include systematically monitoring for infections associated with probiotic organisms. Critical patient outcomes such as all-cause mortality or hospitalizations as well as treatment failures as suggested by reports of failed efficacy and effectiveness studies ( for example, allergy sensitization) should be assessed in future primary research using contr olled trials. Reviews should consider all studies measuring the outcome regardless of whether that outcome was utilized to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention or observed as an adverse event. There is also a lack of studies addressing complex research questions such as interactions with participant, product, or intervention factors associated with the use of probiotic products. These effect s should be addressed with appropriate multivariate analyses, or where possible, in head -to-head comparisons . With regard to participant characteristics studies evaluating effects on elderly participants are largely absent from the current literature. T here is indication that participants with compromised health s hould be monitored closely for potential adverse event s associated with probiotics, such as through the use of data monitoring boards . Controlled trials are needed to determine whether these patients are more likely to experience adverse events compared to control groups with similar participant characteristics , in order to address risk- benefit questions. Interactions with delivery vehicles, in particular yogurt and dairy products, should be investigated further in direct, head -to-head comparisons in order to fully understand the effect of these vehicles. 116 Conclusions Despite a substantial number of publications on probiotics little evidence is available to answer specific questions regarding their safety in research studies. RCTs and case studies diverge in the outcomes they report, there is a lack of assessment and structured reporting of adverse events, and interventions are poorly documented. The available evidence in RCTs does not indicate an increased risk; however, rare adverse events are difficult to assess and the current literature is not well equippe d to answer specific questions on the safety of probiotics in intervention studies with confidence. To quantify potential health risks the presence and absence of adverse events should be reported, adverse events should be monitored (particularly in health-compromised participants), infections due to the administered organisms and treatment failures should be documented; and the effect of delivery vehicles should be assessed systematically. In addition, few studies currently exist that report on effects in the elderly, the long- term effects of probiotics use, or on interventions based on genera other than Lactobacillus . These limitations hinder conclusions regarding the safety of probiotics used to reduce risk and prevent or treat disease. 117 References Judicial Commission of t he International Committee on Systematics of Bacteria.
