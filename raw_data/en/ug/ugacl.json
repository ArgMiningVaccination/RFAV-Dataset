Immunization with a safe and effec tive COVID -19 vaccine is critical t o reduce COVID -19-related illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths. Initial vaccines were authorized by emergency use authorizations (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) when enough preliminary data on their e ffectiveness and safety was collect ed. In a global health pandemic, an EUA allows the FDA to review information from a vaccine manufacturer to determine if a vaccine can be released early. They weigh the benefits of early release against the known and unknown risks of a vaccine. Information about effectiveness and safety conti nues to be collected. If at any time vaccine data shows more risk than benefit, an EUA is re -evaluated. Prov iders are responsible for adhering to all requirements outlined in the CDC C OVID -19 Vaccination Program Provide r agreement. Specifically, providers must administer COVID -19 vaccines in accordance with all program requirements and recommendations of CDC, th e Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and FDA . This applies to both EUA and FDA approved COVID -19 vaccines. Accordingly, use of the se products outside of those that have been approved and authorized by FDA is a violat ion of the provider agreement and could expose providers to the following risks: Administration of the product may not be covered under the PREP Act or the PREP Act decla ration; therefore, providers may not have immunity from claims. Individuals who receive dose s may not be eligible for compensation under the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program after a possible adverse event. CDC has defined the scope of the CDC CO VID-19 Vaccination Program in terms of how vaccines provided by the U nited States government ( USG ) may be us ed. Providers administering doses outside the published recommendations are violat ing the CDC Program provider agreement potentially impacting their ability to remain a provider. Administration fees may not be reimbursable by third party payers. Use of this guide Anyone who handles and/or administer s COVID -19 vaccine should read t his guide . Bookmark this guide for easy reference and check back often for updates. Updates are highlighted in the weekly COVID -19 vaccine provider bulletin. Sign up at COVID -19 Vaccine Provider Updates (www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/vaccine/vaxbulletin.html) . Training requirements The vaccine coordinator and back- up coordinator at each registered site are required to read this COVID -19 vaccine provider guide and watch MDH's online COVID -19 Vaccination Providers Training . These individuals are identified during the registration process. Other people storing, handling, and adminis tering COVID -19 vaccines are highly encouraged to complete the training and read this guide to strengthen their competency in using these vaccines. Access the training at COVID -19 Vaccine Trainings for Health Professionals (www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/vaccine/training.html) . INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINE PROVIDER GUIDE 4 of 17 Roles and responsibilities The vaccine coordinator, at every enrolled provider site, is responsible for ensuring that staff handling and administering vaccine are properly trained and fully competent on stor age, handling, preparation, and adm inistration of the vaccine as applicable to their role. The coordinator can host an internal training and/or require all staff to complete the trainings tha t can be found at COVID -19 Vaccine Trainings for Health Professionals (www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/vaccine/training.html) . Staff new to vacc inating may need additional hands -on training provided by the vaccine coordi nator or other clinical staff at th e registered site. Providers should track , maintain documentation, and monitor the training status of staff.

The vaccine manufact urer will send details on shipment tracking to the primary contact as soon a s the package leaves their warehous e. If you would like to update the contacts for your site, please email health.mdhvaccine@state.mn.us . Enrolled and approved sites do not need to complete any additional registration with the vaccine m anufacturer or distributor to receive doses. INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINE PROVIDER GUIDE 5 of 17 COVID -19 vaccine providers do not need to be enrolled in the Minnesota Vaccines for Children (MnVFC ) program to vaccinate people ages 6 months through 18 years with COVID -19 vaccine. Redistribution If you redistribute COVID -19 vaccine, you must sign a redistribution agreement. To receive a redistribu tion agreement or to determine if your site is covered by an agreement, please email health.mdhvaccine@state.mn.us . S ites must strictly follow the components of the ag reement during redistribution and off -site vaccination. Providers can request redistributed doses or list excess inventory using the COVID -1 9 Vaccine Redistribution Dashboard (https://app.smartsheet.com/b/publish?EQBCT=356419d9e62a427991faa57d6d17c0f2).

For information on transporting COVID -19 vaccine, refer to Transporting COVID -19 V accines (www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/vaccine/transport.pdf) . COVID -19 vaccine supplies COVID -19 vaccines and supplies for administration are distributed at no cost to providers registered for COVID -19 vaccination. Ancillary supply kits are automatically ordered in amounts to match vaccine orders. Pediatric ancillary kits are available with the same supplies as adult kits , except they include 1 -inch needle s only. Diluent , mixing needles and syringes, and extra alcohol pads will be included in the ancillary kit for vaccines requiring reconstitution . Note : kits do not include sharps containers, gloves, or bandages. Providers can opt out of getting ancillary k its for vaccines that do not require diluent for vaccine shipments coming from MDH . For vaccines that require reconstitution , a combined kit will be included that contains administration supplies (as noted above), mixing supplies , and diluent vials. If you redistribute vaccine, you also need to redistribute the ancillary supplies. Single dose vial vaccines do not come with ancillary kits. In order to opt out of ancillary kits, please note this in the shipping information s ection i n MIIC. For questions or p roblems related to ancillary supply kits (e.g., missing supplies, etc.), contact : Pfizer vaccine: McKesson MedSurg to report email COVIDVaccineSupport@McKesson.com . To report defective o r faulty me dical equipment (e.g., syringes, needles), visit the FDA's MedWatch Online Voluntary Reporting Form (www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/) and complete FD A Form 3500 for health professionals . COVID -19 vaccine products and recommendations Several COVID -19 vaccines are currently available. Having mul tiple products makes COVID -19 vaccine more accessible, but it also increase s the risk of medication errors and can lead to vaccine waste . Sites a re encouraged to only store and administer one COV ID-19 mRNA vaccine product . Double check the product specific EUA provider fact sheet or package insert for age indication, route, dosage, and storage and handling requirements. The currently FDA -approved o r FDA -authorized COVID -19 vaccines are summarized below. None of the current vaccines are live -virus vaccines o r contain any preservatives.

A shorter interval (3 week s for Novavax and Pfizer -BioNTe ch; 4 weeks for Moderna) between the first and second doses remains the recommended interval for: people who are moderately to severely immunoc ompromised; adults ages 65 years and older; and others who need rapid protection due to increased concern about c ommunity transmission or risk of severe disease. *** A monovalent Novavax booster dose may be used in limited situations in people ages 18 year s and older who completed any FDA - approved or FDA -authorized monovalent primary series, have not received any previous booster dose(s), and are unable to receive an mRNA vaccine (i.e., mRNA vaccine contraindicated or not available) or unwilling to receive an mRNA vaccine and would otherwise not receive a booster dose. The monovalent Nov avax booster do se is administer ed at least 6 months after completion of any primary series. COVID -19 vaccination guidance for people NOT moderately or severely immunocompromi sed CDC recommends that people ages 6 months and older receive at least one bivale nt mRNA COVID -19 vaccine. The number of bivalent doses varies by age, vaccine, previous COVID -19 vaccines received, and the presence of moderate or severe immune compromise. Refer to CDC: Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID -19 Vaccines: Guidance for people who are not moderately or severely immunocompromised f or detailed schedules. COVID -19 vaccination guidanc e for people moderately or severely immunocompromised People who are moderately or severely immunocompromised have the option to receive one additional dose of a homol ogous b ivalent mRNA vaccine at least two months following the last recommended bivalent m RNA COVID - 19 vaccine dose. Further additional homologous bivalent dose(s) may be administered, informed by the clinical judgement of a healthcare provider and personal prefer ence and circumstances. Any further additional doses should be administered at lea st two months after the last CO VID-19 vaccine dose. Refer to : CDC: Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID -19 Vaccines: Guidance for people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised (www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid- 19/clinical- considerations/interim -considerations - us.html#immunocompromised) for more specific information on this population, including detailed schedules . Considerations for people ages 65 years and older to receive an additional bivalent mRNA dose People ages 65 years and older h ave the option to receive one additional bivalent mRNA vaccine dose if it has been at least four months after their first bivalent mRNA dose. The option to receive one additi onal bivalent mRNA dose may be informed by the clinical judgement of a healthcare provider, a person's risk for severe COVID - 19 due to the presence of underlying medial conditions and age, and personal preference and circumstances. INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINE PROVIDER GUIDE 8 of 17 COVID -19 vaccine storage and handling COVID -19 vaccine products are temperature -sensitive and must be stored and handled correctly to e nsure efficacy and maximize shelf life. Proper storage and handling practices are critical to minimize vaccine loss and limit risk of administering COVID -19 vaccine with reduced effectiveness. Storage and handling requirements for COVID -19 vaccine products vary. Follow specific shipping, storage, and handling requirements for each vaccine product in their respective package insert o r EUA fact sheet for healthcare providers at FDA: COVID must be stored in dedicated refrigeration/freezer units. Find more information on C DC's storage and handling recommendations at Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit (www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storage/toolkit/index.html ). St oring vaccine in the freezer o f a combinati on household unit is not recommended. If your facility provides frozen vaccine, you must have a separate freezer. Refer to Va ccination at Satellite, Temporary, or Off -site Locations (www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/vaccine/guideappd.pdf) f or storage and handling guidance , including many helpful resources for transporting vaccine and monitoring temperatures. Provide rs new to vaccine storage and handling, should view CDC's, You Call the Shots module. Learn more at CDC: CE Ins tructions for WB4417: Immunization: You Ten and Handling \u20142021 (www2a.cdc.gov/nip/isd/ycts/mod1/courses/sh/ce.asp ). Expiration date and beyond- use date (BUD) In certain conditions vaccines must be used before the actu al expiration date. This is referred to as the beyond- use date (BUD). T he BUD is determined based on the storage conditions and the time a vial is first punctured for COVID -19 vaccines . The person that performs the step in the administration process that c hanges the BUD (e.g., punctures the vial, reconstitutes it, moves it from the free zer to refrigerator, etc.) must document the new BUD on a label. BUD tracker labels are available on CDC's website. Check expiration dates and beyond- use dates closely. Disca rd the vaccine based on the earliest date, whether that is the manufacturer's labe led expiration date or the BUD. Example: Undiluted Pfizer 5-11 years vaccine (orange cap) can be stored for 10 weeks in the refrigerator. If it was placed in the refrigerator on December 20, its BUD is February 28. However, if the vaccine vial's expiration date is February 8, then it needs to be discarded at the end of the day on February 8. Keep in mind that COVID -19 vaccine products do not contain any preservative and theref ore can't be used after a certain number of hours after the vial is first puncture d. Carefully read and follow th e EUA fact sheet for health care providers and/or manufacturers' websites for each vaccine product regarding expiration and beyond -use dates. Managing out -of-range temperatures (excursions) As with all vaccines, if COVID -19 vaccines are exposed to out -of-range temperatures, take imm ediate action. Mark the vaccine \"do not use\" until its usability is determined. If vaccine thaws, do not re -freeze. Contact MDH 's Immunization Program Monday through Friday between 8 :00 a.m. and 4:3 0 p.m. at 651- 201- 5414 to determine your next steps. Make sure to have specific information about temperatures, duration of excursion, etc. available. Contact information for vaccine manufacturers : INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINE PROVIDER GUIDE 9 of 17 (www.novavax.com/contact -us/email -us) Some vaccine manufacturers have online temperature excursion tools you may use : Moderna: Storage & temperature excursion for Moderna COVID -19 vaccine (https://tools.modernamedinfo.com/en- US/excursion/introduction- landing -page) Contact MDH even if you have contacted the vaccine manufacturer or used their onli ne temper ature excursion tool and the issue was resolved . Information to include when reporting a vaccine excursion Your email address and phone number. Storage condition at the time of excursion (e.g., frozen storage, refrigerated storage, or room tempera ture). Duration of excursion. Interim disposition of affected vials (e.g., returned to freezer or refrigerator , moved to another storage unit, or maintained at room temperature). Visual inspection, noting any change in the vaccine's state (e.g., frozen via ls that thawed or thawed vials that were re- frozen). If the vaccine is determined to be nonviable (not usable) it should be disca rded immediately. Report these doses as nonviable vaccine to MDH in the Minnesota Immunization Information Connection (MIIC). Refer to the section below on reporting vaccine wastage and spoilage for instructions. Clinical considerations for authorized vaccines ACIP has issued interim recommendations for the use of COVID -19 vaccines for the preve ntion of COVID -19. These recommendations are published in CDC: Use of COVID -19 Vaccines in the United States (www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid -19/clinical- considerations/covid -19-vaccines -us.html) . C DC is updating these recommendations frequently as new vaccines are authorized and information changes. A summary of recent changes and the date they were last updated is at the top of the webpage. Resources for scre ening patients before COVID -19 vaccination Template : COVID -19 Vaccine Screening and Agreement on COVID -19 Vaccine Providers (www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/vaccine/provider.ht ml). CDC: Prevaccination -form.pdf ). INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINE PROVIDER GUIDE 10 of 17 Verify patient COVID -19 immunization data Prior to administering a dose of COVID -19 vaccine, please review the patient's immunization history. The primary source of COVID -19 vaccine administration data should be the Minnesota Immunization Information Connect ion (MIIC ). If the data for a patient is not in MIIC, other acceptable sources include : 1. Their CDC vaccination card. 2. An official document from a health care provider or another state's Immunization Information System (IIS) with day, month, year , and produc t administered as well as the patient's name and date of birth. 3. Electronic documentation from a health care provider or another state's Immunization Information System (IIS) such as the MyChart app or another consumer access application (a pp) that includes day, month, year, and product administered as well as the patient's name and date of birth. 4. A patient's U.S. Department of State's Vaccination Documentation form DS -3025 that includes a patient's verified past immunizations. Verbal presentations of data are not acceptable. Please enter immunization data from these acceptable sources into a patient's record in your electronic health record ( EHR ) or directly into MIIC. Remember that in addition to M innesota data, MIIC regularly receives data for Minnesota residents for doses administered in Iowa, Wisconsin, and North Dakota. A patient may not yet be in MIIC because they have recently moved to Minnesota or do not have any recent immunizations administered in Minnesota . If a patient is found in MIIC, t heir asso ciated immun ization data still may not be in MIIC for several reasons , including : they received an immunization in another state/country that does not regularly send data to MIIC , the provider who administered the dose didn't enter i t into their s ystems or MIIC , the data was entered by the provider into their systems but has not yet been sent to MIIC , the patient has opted out of MIIC , or the patient has locked their record to another provider. For more information, review MIIC user guidance for looking up a client at Client Search and Printing Immunization Records (www.health.st ate.mn.us/people/immunize/miic/train/clientsearch.html) a nd entering immunization data at Adding Immunizations Not Using Inventory (www.health.state.mn.us/people/immunize/miic/train/addnoinv.html) . COVID -19 vaccine administration Based on their scope of practice, all people who administer vaccines should receive comprehensiv e, compet ency- based staff training and education, including the \"ri ghts of vaccine administration,\" patient care before, during, and after vaccine administration, vaccine preparation, and skill validation. Vaccine administration resources for all people who vaccina te, including staff who are new to vaccination and staff w ho need a refresher: CDC: Immunization Education and Training (www.cdc.gov/vaccines/ed/index.html ) CDC: COVID Vaccination Training Programs -19-Clinical- Training -and- \"Vaccine Administration\" e -Learn CD C: an d Prevention of Vaccine -Preventable Diseases (www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/index.html ) Known as the \"Pink IM (Intramuscular) Injections (www.health.s tate.mn.us/people/immunize/hcp/admim.pdf) INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINE PROVIDER GUIDE 11 of 17 Intramuscular (IM) Injection: Sites (https://youtu.be/PqSuCPnPeYE) Preparing COV ID-19 Vaccines COVID -19 (www.health.stat e.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/vaccine/pedstips.html) COVID -19 Vaccine Trainings for Health Professionals (www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/vaccine/training.html#supp) Immunization Basic Principles supplemental on- demand training for vaccine providers COVID -19 PPE and Source Control Grids (www.health.state.mn.us/disease s/coronavirus/hcp/ppegrid.pdf) One & use authorization ( EUA ) fact and vaccine information sheets (VISs) EUA fact sheets EUA fact sheets for vacc ination providers are product -specific information sheets that replace the usual package insert. The fact sheet for vaccine recipients is similar to a licensed product's VIS . The EUA fact sheet for vaccine rec ipients e xplains the vaccine risks and benefits, specific vaccine product information and its use, and information from clinical trials that support the FDA's emergency use authorization. You are legally required to give an EUA fact sheet to each recipient /parent/l egal representative prior to vaccinati on. Be prepared to answer questions about the vaccine. EUA fact sheets for providers and recipients are available on FDA, CDC, MDH, and vaccine manufacturer websites. Translated fact sheets in multiple languag es are on the FDA website: Pfizer Healthcare Provider Fact Sheet (www.fda.gov/media/167211/download) Moderna Healthcare Provider Fact Sheet (www.fda.gov/media/167208/download) Novavax COVID -19 Vaccine Healthcare Provider Fact Sheet (www.fda.gov/media/159897/download) Vaccine information sheets (VIS) Vaccines licensed through the FDA and added to the vaccine injury table are required to have a vaccine information sheet. Federal law requires that patients receive a vaccine inform ation she et prior to administration of a licensed vaccine. COVID -19 vaccine reminders Most people age d 6 years a nd older now only need one dose of the bivalent vaccine. For those under 6 years old or who are immunocompromised and need more than one dose for a prim ary series , it is important that people receive all doses, and that doses are the same vaccine product. Make an effort to keep doses within the recommended interval. If the interval is missed, the dose should be given as soon as possible , and the series do es not need to be restarted. Providers should refer to: CDC: Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID -19 Overvi ew of COVID considerations -us.html#covid- vaccines ) to unde rstand the schedule for situations that require more than one dose . Vaccination reminders are critical to ensu re compli ance with vaccine dosing intervals and to achieve optimal vaccine effectiveness. Use these tips for COVID -19 vaccine reminders: INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINE PROVIDER GUIDE 12 of 17 Make sure each person getting vaccinated knows if they need additional doses and schedule an appointment for the next dose. Comp lete a COV ID-19 vaccination record card (vaccine manufacturer, lot number, date of dose received, and the date the next dose is due) for each person who is vaccinated. Encourage them to keep the card and bring it to the next dose appointment. If the patient has a sm artphone, ask them to take a photo of their vaccination card and/or enter the date when the next vaccine is due into their electronic calendar. Using Minnesota Immunization Information Connection (MIIC) for vaccine reminders : Record all vaccinati ons in MIIC within 7 days after vaccine administration. Pull lists of people overdue/recommended for COVID -19 vaccine using the MIIC client follow -up functionality in MIIC . Information on client follow -up is available at Client Follow -Up (www.health.state.mn.us/people/immunize/miic/train/followup.html) . Partner with MDH to text your clients who have not received any COVID -19 vaccine or are kids ov erdue for routin e immuniz ations. This program is free to the participating provider and does not take a lot of resources to implement. Typically, a 30-minute conference call is all that's needed to set up the texting activity. For more information, please email the MIIC Help Desk at health.miic texting hstate.mn.us . Please fi nd more information on this project here at Reminder/Recall Using T ex t Messages (www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/vaccine/remindrecall.pdf) . Look at your electronic health record or vaccine management tool to identify if there is a next dose reminder function already built in (e.g., patient portal). Use other methods, such as text messaging, phone calls, email, and mail. Post -vaccination care Vaccine efficacy All COVID -19 vaccines currently a pproved or authorized in the United States (Pfizer -BioNTech , Moderna, Novavax , and Janssen) are effective at pre venting severe disease, hospitalizations , and death from COVID -19. Post -vaccination instructions Preparing people for what to expect after vaccination and when to follow up with a health care provider is a best practice and expectation. Patient instruction s should include information specific to the produc t they are receiving. This information should include: Common side effects (listed in the EUA fact sheet). When to contact their health care provider (such as signs of an allergic reaction or medical conce rns that may or may not be related to vaccination). For vaccine(s) requiring more than one dose, the importance of receiving all recommended dose (s) of vaccine to build an adequate immune response. What it means to be up to date with your COVID -19 Vaccines refer to : CDC: Stay Up to Date with Your COVID - 19 Vaccines (www.cdc.gov/coronav irus/2019- ncov/vaccines/stay -up-to-date.html) Treatment ng a COV ID-19 vaccine dose, over the counter fever, or pain medication (e.g., acetaminophen, non- steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs) may be used for local or systemic symptoms, if medically appropriate. Refer to the applicable EUA fact sheet for recipients to view side effects listed for each vaccine produc t. INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINE PROVIDER GUIDE 13 of 17 It is not recommended to routinely take over -the-counter fever or pain medication prior to vaccination to prevent symptoms following vaccination. Allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) Anaphylactic re actions i n people receiving the COVID -19 vaccine outside of clinical trials have been reported. While rare, these events highlight the importance of a quick and competent response. A ntihistamines should not be taken before vaccination to pre vent allergic r eactions , as they do not prevent anaphylaxis and might mask cutaneous (skin) symptoms. Refer to CDC: Interim Cl inical Considerations fo r Use precautions (www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid- 19/clinical- or more information regarding adv erse reactions. Appropriate medical treatment used to manag e immediate allergic reactions (e.g., epinephrine) must be immediately available in the event an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs following administration of the vaccine. An allergic reaction to a vaccine can be a life -threatening event. Know the early s igns of anaphylaxis: throat closing sensation , swelling of throat, face or lips , hives or itching , stridor (high- pitched whistling sound) , wheezing , coughing , dizzines s, fainting , fast heart rate , low blood pressure , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , and/or abdo minal pain. CDC has a helpful poster on Recognizing and Responding to A naphylaxis (www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid- 19/downloads/recognizing -responding -to-anaphylaxis -508.pdf ). Observation periods following Syncope (fainting) might occur in association with any injectable vaccine, espe cially in adolescents. In accordance with general best practice guidelines for immunization (GBPG) , vaccination providers, particularly whe n vaccinating adolescents, should consider observing vaccine recipients for 15 minutes after vaccination. Additionally, providers should consider observing people with the following medical histories for 30 minutes after COVID -19 vaccination to monitor for allergic reactions: Allergy -related contraindication to a different type of COVID -19 vaccine . Non-severe, immediate (onset within 4 hour s) allerg ic reaction after a previous dose of COVID -19 vaccine . Anaphylaxis after non- COVID the rapies . See also CDC: Interim Clinical Considerations for Use and precautions (www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid Administer vaccines in settin gs where staff are trained to recognize and respond to re actions. Immediate systemic reactions can include fainting (syncope) and severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). Learn more about how to prepare for anaphylactic reactions at CDC: Interim Consid erations: Preparing for the Potential Management of Vaccination nsiderations: Staff should be trained in CPR and be familiar with the signs, symptoms, and treatment of anaphylaxis. Have the appropriate equipment and medication on hand. Have trained staff available to administer epinephrine and maintain an airway in set tings where vaccinations are given. COVID -19 vaccination locations should have at least three doses of epinephrine available at all times and a way to quickly replace doses. INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINE PROVIDER GUIDE 14 of 17 Have a signed hard copy of a plan and age-appropri ate protocol s for the medical management of a vaccine reaction. Ensure staff review the plan and protocol and are ready to carry it out before giving vaccinations or providing related services. Immunization Action Coalition ( IAC): Vaccine Information for Health Care Professionals (immuni ze.org) has examples of emergency plans. Refer to Medical Management of Vaccine Reactions in Children and Teens in a Community Setting (www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3082a.pdf ) and Medical Management of Vaccine Reactions in Adults in a Community Setting (www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3082.pdf) f or more information. Report vaccine ad verse events and administration errors As with licensed vaccines, vaccines under an Emergency Use Authorization have the same requirements to report to the Vaccine Adverse Event Report System (VAERS) any situations , including serious adverse events , that occurred a fter vaccination. This is regardless of determination of cause. As part of the CDC COVID -19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement, vacc ination providers are required to report the following to VAERS: Vaccine administration errors, even if they di d not inv olve an adverse effect . Serious adverse events : Death . A life-threatening adverse event . An event requiring hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization . Prolonged impact on a person's ability to perform daily activities . A congenital anomaly/birth defect. A significant medical event that may cause harm to a person and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outc omes listed above. Cases of M ultisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS) in children and adults . Cases of myocarditis o r peri carditis. Cases of COVID -19 (including vaccine breakthrough cases) that result in hospitalization or death. Learn more about VAERS at CDC: Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS): How VAERS works (www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html#anchor_1616772696807. To submit an event, go to VAERS: Report an Adv erse Event (vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html) . There is a checklist on this page to help gather information needed when submitting a report ( VAERS 2.0 C hecklist [vaers.hhs.gov/docs/VAERS 2.0_Checklist.pdf ]). HIPAA permits reporting of vaccine adverse events and medical documentation to VAERS for public health purposes under 45 CFR, section 164.512(b), as authorized by 42 USC 300aa -25. Resources to assist clinicians in possible COVID -19 vacci ne-related adverse events Urgent consults: Health care providers can contact the CDC Emergency Opera tions Center at 770 -488- 7100 if they need an urgent COVID -19 vaccine safety consultation. In case of a health emergency, provider s should call 911. Complex health situations following COVID -19 vacc ination: For complex vaccine safety questions, health care providers or health departments in the United States can request a consultation f rom the CDC : Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) Project (www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/cisa/index.html) C OVIDvax clinicians. For non -urgent concerns, providers may Contact CDC -INFO (wwwn.cdc.gov/DCS/ContactUs/Form) . Document administered doses INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINE PROVIDER GUIDE 15 of 17 Give the vaccinated person (and caregiver, if applicable), a completed COVID -19 vaccination record card that includes the name of the vaccine given, the l ot number , the date administered, and the name and location of the administering clinic. Providers sho uld follow their usual documentation processes in the patient's permanent medical record. Record vaccine administration information such as: Vaccine name . Date of administration. Vaccine manufacturer and lot number. Vaccination site and route. Name and title of the person who administered the va ccine. If a vaccinated person misplaces their COVID -19 vaccination record card , providers that administered the vaccine should replace their card if requested. COVID -19 vaccine reporting requirements The Minnesota Immunization Information Connection (MIIC) (www.health.state.mn.us/miic) is a statewide immunization in formation system that stores electronic immunization records for Minnesota health s ervice providers and for the public. MIIC combines immunizations a person has received into a single record, even if the shots were given by different health care providers in the st ate. Per the CDC provider agreement, product -specific COVID -19 vaccination data must be reported within 24 hours of vaccine administration. Data reported to MIIC in a timely manner will be routinely sent to the CDC in de -identified form to meet th eir data requirements and in a manner consistent with Minnesota laws. There are a number of data elements for each COVID -19 vaccination that is administered. Data elements for COVID -19 vaccination reporting These data elements are subject to change. Vaccin e recipie nt data First name Middle name Last name Date of birth Sex Full address (street, street 2, city, county, state, ZIP code) Race/ethnicity* *MDH requires providers to enter available race/ethnicity information into MIIC as part of their regular reporting f or all patie nts who are getting vaccinated. Vaccine administration data Administration date CVX code CPT code ( note: For Moderna boosters to be reported as a booster and not a third dose, the corresponding CPT code MUST be included) NDC (if kno wn) MVX cod e Lot number Expiration date Body site Route of administration Responsible organization Administered at location Vaccination refusal (when appropriate) Become familiar with MIIC.

If you have any questions, please contact the MIIC Help Desk at health.miichelp@state.mn.us . Managing vaccine inventory Reporting vaccine inventory MDH report s inventory to CDC weekly . To facilitate this reporting and identify inventory across the state, all COVID -19 vaccine that is redistributed needs to be reported to MDH within one week of redistribution. Learn more about COVID -19 vaccine redistribution at COVID -19 Va ccine: Redistribution and Off -site Vaccination Guide (www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/vaccine/vaxredistribution.pdf) . Reporting vaccine wastage and spoilage Tracking vaccine wastage is part of vaccine inventory. Sites are asked to report wastage or spoilage of vaccine doses (e.g., exposure to out -of-range temperatures, vaccines in refrigerator past the allowed time, doses drawn up and not used, doses remaining in vials at the time of the beyond use date (BUD) expiration, vaccine discoloration or p articu lates, unable to get the recommended number of doses out of a vial, etc.). A ny vaccine determined to be nonviable (not usable) should be discarded immediately. Registered COVID -19 providers must report vaccine wastage in MIIC within one week of wa stage. There are two ways to report wastage/spoilage. Choose one method of reporting: Preferred: Submit this information in MIIC. More information is available at Reportin g Nonviable COVID -19 Vaccine to MIIC ( www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/vaccine/nonviablereport.pdf ). If your organization is not able to use the preferred method of reporting via MIIC, you may use the PDF form, Minnesota Department of Health COVID -19 Nonviable Vaccine Form (www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/vaccine/nonviableform.pdf ). To report wasted vaccine to MIIC, you need to be se t up with a MIIC user role that has ordering privileges. Please contact health.mdhvaccine@state.mn.us with questions about getting set up to access this feature in MIIC. INTERIM COVID -19 VACCINE PROVIDER GUIDE 17 of 17 Expired or spoiled COVID -19 via ls are not being returned to the manufacturer or McKesson. When entering nonviable COVID -19 vaccine into MIIC, you may receive an email about returning vaccine. Please disregard the email. Returning vaccine is our process only for other, non- COVID -19 vacci nes. Billing and reimbursement COVID -19 vaccine administration fee There is no cost for COVID -19 vaccine for vaccine prov iders or for vaccine recipients. Per the CDC provider agreement, vaccine providers must administer COVID -19 vaccine, regardless of the vac cine r ecipient's ability to pay COVID -19 vaccine administration fees or their insurance coverage status. There should be no out -of- pocket costs for COVID -19 vaccine. Insurance plans should reimburse providers for the administration fee. Vaccine provider s may see k appropriate reimbursement from a program or plan that covers COVID -19 vaccine administration fees for the vacc ine recipient. For patients who have a Minnesota Health Care Plan (MHCP), providers will be reimbursed. As a reminder, COVID -19 vaccine s are exempt from cost -sharing. MHCP also covers vaccine counseling that occurs during visits and for thos e COVID -19 vacc ines they can administer. For details, r Provider Manual: .
