We are also working together to help local health departments provide COVID-19 vaccinations in Knox and surrounding counties. As of March 4, 2021, Blount Memorial Hospital, Covenant Health, East Tennessee Children's Hospital, Tennova Healthcare and The University of Tennessee Medical Center have collectively provided a milestone 100,662 doses through on-site, drive-through and community vaccine clinics while following Tennessee Department of Health guidelines for who can receive the vaccine and when. Currently, community members age 65 years and older as well as front-line healthcare workers, hospital employees, healthcare professionals and staff (including doctors, dentists and first responders), patients in long-term care facilities, teachers and other school and child-care staff are eligible to receive the vaccine. On Monday, March 8, eligibility expands to Phase 1c including those 16 years old or older with high-risk health conditions. For the full phased eligibility list and criteria, see the [Tennessee Vaccine Phases](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcovid19.tn.gov%2Fcovid-19-vaccines%2Fvaccine-phases%2F&data=04%7C01%7CSWhitt%40utmck.edu%7C6d9352951c4743adee2a08d8d9c5d449%7Caa72ecc9aba94cf5b980b2abebe86276%7C0%7C0%7C637498790983263123%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=DRPjUAF0SSwIxyX%2BrXwIdH2al%2BnfjVRoUteicNj6nEw%3D&reserved=0) guidelines by the Tennessee Department of Health. The hospital systems will continue to offer vaccinations as supplies become available and encourage people who want to receive the vaccine to check the websites and social media channels of the health systems as well as local health departments to learn about future vaccination opportunities. Information is updated frequently, as vaccine availability depends on the supplies provided to the hospital systems by the state of Tennessee. "}
