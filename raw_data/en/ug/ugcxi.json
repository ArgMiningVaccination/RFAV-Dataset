MOTHER OF GOD MEDIATRIX OF ALL GRACE THE MESSAGE OF OUR LADY OF MOUNT GANXIM-BATIM, GOA - INDIA 'PLEAD FOR PEACE FROM THE IMMACULATE HEART OF MARY, FOR THE LORD HAS CONFIDED THE PEACE OF THE WORLD TO HER' Description of the Video: This video broadcast does NOT disapprove Covid-19 Vaccination, neither does it question the current medical and scientific evidence of Covid-19 disease prevention through Covid-19 Vaccination but offers material for spiritual discernment with regards to ethically compromised Covid-19 Vaccines. As of February 2021, there are more than 175 Covid-19 vaccines being developed worldwide and of these there are more than 60 that are into clinical trials and a few that use foetal cell lines generated from Human Embryonic Kidney cells - from the remains of a voluntary aborted foetus in their research and production process. In August 2020, three of Australia's most senior archbishops wrote to the Australian Prime Minister, criticising this vaccine being developed with the use of \"a cell line cultured from an electively aborted human foetus\"[1], whilst in the US - their Bishops in a statement have advised their faithful to avoid morally compromised vaccines if possible[2]. The Catholic Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith has in a statement on 21st December 2020[3] declared their support for ethically uncompromised vaccines over ethically compromised ones, but however has had to accept ethically compromised vaccines when there are no other vaccines available. In this Book 'Suffering and The Thesis of Purgatory' the Blessed Virgin Mary reveals to Iveta Fernandes that 'abortion is a sacrifice to Satan'[ [4](https://www.mediatrixofallgrace.com/spiritual-warning)] and a diabolic act[ [5](https://www.mediatrixofallgrace.com/spiritual-warning)] and essentially what we are doing here is raiding this dead body of an intentionally killed foetus, made in the image of God and with unavailable consent create foetal cell lines from the tissue of this unborn child to be used in the production of such a vaccine. This is a serious bioethics flaw and an outrageous offence against God! There is however a moral obligation on each one of us to safeguard ourselves and our neighbour in this pandemic, but moral obligation relies on conscience[ [6](https://www.mediatrixofallgrace.com/spiritual-warning)] and there are other irreproachable vaccines available and we should if possible choose these. Our Blessed Mother laments 'that the conscience of many has grown dull.. for sin is compounding as the sacraments which they have neglected in the past are now no longer available in many areas' [ [7](https://www.mediatrixofallgrace.com/spiritual-warning)] In the book: 'Suffering and The Thesis of Purgatory: With Prophetic Warnings for Our World', the Blessed Virgin Mary expounds on the Biblical truths of marriage, family and sexual morality. She also speaks about the culture of death and against abortion, Euthanasia and other sins and warns us about the fall out of the diabolic vaccine - the ethically compromised Vaccine - resulting in spiritual death, bodily harm and even physical death. Considering the Holistic approach of Medicine focusing on a person's physical, emotional, social and spiritual wellbeing - receiving such an 'ethically compromised Covid-19 vaccine' is a harbinger of spiritual defilement and bodily harm to a person[ [8](https://www.mediatrixofallgrace.com/spiritual-warning) []](https://www.mediatrixofallgrace.com/spiritual-warning). While nobody will deny that we must respect the dignity of an unborn human life, we should also respect on moral or ethical grounds the choice of an individual to accept another Covid-19 Vaccination other than an ethically compromised Covid-19 vaccine. We request that you spiritually and morally discern on the message of Ethically compromised Covid-19 Vaccines presented in the book ['Suffering and The Thesis of Purgatory: With Prophetic Warnings for Our World'. ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XFP59C9/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=suffering+and+the+thesis&qid=1614245642&sr=8-1) In this message through Iveta, Our Blessed Mother calls upon the priests to take upon the mission to exorcise those affected by the spirits of darkness and bring them into the spirit of light. And once purified as when they were at Baptism, they will have the grace, courage and strength to offer deliverance to those in darkness and bring them back to God [ [9](https://www.mediatrixofallgrace.com/spiritual-warning)] To those who have accepted the diabolic Vaccine - that is the vaccine that uses aborted foetal cell lines in their research and production process or the ethically compromised Vaccine - Our Blessed Mother calls upon such children to be exorcised to prevent them from becoming demonic advocates [ [10](https://www.mediatrixofallgrace.com/spiritual-warning)] Pope Leo XIII has given us a Prayer of Exocism and even guidelines for both the Laity and Priests. Serious cases of possession of souls are only exorcised by a Catholic priest, who has been granted special permission with a Blessing by a Bishop. However, the Spiritual & Natural Remedy that Our Blessed Mother has made known - the sacramental, though it seems foolish in the eyes of the wise - has the Power of God and Grace in it to destroy the power of evil that no other can do so in this battle between good and evil[ [11](https://www.mediatrixofallgrace.com/spiritual-warning)].
