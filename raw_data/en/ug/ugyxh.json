Naturopathy is a complementary medicine system that works holistically to treat the underlying cause or causes of health conditions. This means that a naturopath looks at the body as a whole and not as separate body systems. We investigate how insufficiency or weakness in one system, affects the functioning of others and how this ultimately presents as signs and symptoms of illness and disease. This interplay between all our body systems should be in a state of balance (homeostasis) for optimal health. There are many factors in our modern lifestyles that drive our health out of this balance. Naturopathic treatment aims to counteract these drivers and restore vitality and well being. Naturopathy can assist in the management of a vast array of health conditions Gastrointestinal Conditions Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Gut Dysbiosis (micro flora imbalance) Endocrine Ovary Syndrome Reflux constipation and/or diarrhoea Skin Conditions Eczema/dermatitis, Acne, Psoriasis, Urticaria/hives Nervous System Support Stress, Fatigue, Anxiety, Insomnia, Low mood & other mood disorders, Headaches Hormonal Imbalances Both male & female reproductive health, Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS), Endometriosis This is by no means an extensive list. Many health conditions can improve with a wholistic approach to treatment. Prevention is also key. Naturopathic treatment always looks at ways to minimise the development of disease. Naturopathic Treatments Herbal Medicine Herbs can be prescribed in many forms, such as tablet and capsule formulations and topical preparations like creams and ointments. But my favourite way of prescribing herbs is as a liquid mixture. Herbal mixtures allow multiple herb extracts to be blended in a tailored manner for the individual patient according to their needs. This means that one prescribed herbal mix can have several therapeutic actions which address multiple concerns. Dietary Advice What we eat has a significant impact on every aspect of our overall health. You have probably heard the words of Hippocrates \"All disease begins in the gut.\" Looking at one's diet is an integral part of a wholistic approach to health. I can help patients identify which components of their diet may be causing harm. Nutritional Supplementation Many of you would be aware of the numerous vitamin and mineral supplements available. As a naturopath I prescribe nutritional supplements in an evidence based and targeted manner. This involves using therapeutic dosing ranges and specific combinations for best health outcomes. Lifestyle Modification Treating patients wholistically includes considering the different environmental and lifestyle factors that may be contributing to their health status. I like working with patients to modify these factors in a realistic way. Some things can be easy changes while others can take some commitment and time. It's all a balance. "}
