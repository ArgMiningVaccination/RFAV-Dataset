Wellness touches every aspect of your life, from your nutrition to your movements to your self-care routines. You control your wellness. Chiropractic care is centered around the understanding that the body is able to achieve and maintain health through its own natural recuperative abilities. To do this, your body must have a well-functioning nervous system and receive health maintenance necessities such as adequate nutrition, water, rest, and movement or exercise. Without having these necessities on a consistent basis, your body cannot maintain a state of good health. Your wellness needs are as unique as you are. Achieve Balance is dedicated to offering individualized chiropractic care. Our [wide range of services](/individualized-chiropractic-care-services) can match your specific conditions like [back pain](/back-pain), [migraines](/migraines), [posture correction](/posture-correction) & [more](/individualized-chiropractic-care-services). We can improve your natural health together. Ready to live pain free? Stress Management and Treatment Healing the effects of stress, naturally One in five Americans feel regular, intense amounts of stress. It's not a shocking statistic. Life comes with stress. At home, at work, or even engaging in activities with those close to us, we experience stress. This doesn't mean stress cannot be managed. Stress affects your body's makeup. Stress affects the sympathetic nervous system. This part of the nervous system activates our fight, flight, or freeze response. When we feel stressed or anxious, our bodies release two hormones, cortisol and adrenaline. High stress will cause a higher production of these hormones, which jumpstarts stress responses. We may start to feel physically and mentally unwell. Stress in the body causes tension. Tension causes the cartilage around the bones to flare up and inflame. Corrective chiropractic care not only treats the pain, but the cause of discomfort to the body. By pushing our bodies to over work, stress forces our lives out of balance, changing our posture, modifying how we eat and sleep, and causing chronic pain. Often the first clues about being stressed are physical signs such as tiredness, headaches, or an upset stomach. Stress is not a life requirement Chiropractic care works from the spine, the core of the nervous system. This is why chiropractic care can treat a wide variety of wellness blockers, such as carpal tunnel or shoulder pain. [Chiropractic care is a natural and effective treatment for stress](https://www.achievebalancechiropractic.com/stress-management). After your first treatment, you may no longer feel the effects of pain. Chiropractic care can also release your dependency on pain medications.

Food and nutrition are important determinants of morbidity and mortality in our modern communities. Almost everyone will say they could use a little more vegetables or fruit in their diets; quickly followed by admitting to eating too much sugar or processed food. The miracle of nutrient-dense foods is that they will work faster than you can imagine. Achieve Balance offers nutrition advice to guide patients to a practical balanced diet. Our nutrition knowledge provides supportive, in-depth wellness coaching throughout your corrective chiropractic experience and beyond. Food allergy testing is an important first step in our process. Food allergy testing will alert us if there are any quick corrective issues. Food allergies are the unknown root of a wide variety of health issues.
