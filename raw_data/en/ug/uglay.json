UConn President Susan Herbst and Dr.Marc Lalande (Vice President for Research Programs, Shriners Hospitals, and Founder and previous Director of the ISG) opened the conference, highlighting the significant accomplishments of the Institute, including the establishment of the Center for Genome Innovation, the Computational Biology Core, and the Single Cell Genomics Center. The ISG has held numerous workshops and symposia topromote genomics research collaborations among UConn, UConn Health, and the Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine faculty. The celebration i ncluded presentations by: Mark Gerstein (Yale ); Eric Green (Director, National Human Genome Research Institute); Charles Lee (ISG, The Jackson Laboratory Graveley and Rachel O'Neill (ISG, UConn). The day-long event included a poster session, with 45 posters being displayed from undergraduates and master's students, graduate students, and senior researchers (postdocs, research technicians, and junior faculty). Institute for Systems Genomics Newsletter Message message from the new ISG Director Rachel O'Neill has accepted the position asDirector of the Institute for Systems Genomics. Over the lastfive years, the ISG has developed top- tierservice and training structures inthe Center for Genome Innovation, Computational Biology Core and a joint JAX-UConn Single Cell Facility . These facilities are open toallfaculty and students across allcampuses of UConn through support services or curricularparticipation. Todate, wehave supported over 160 different PIsand the generation of over $100 million in grant revenues, established a new PSM inGenetic Counseling under the directorship of Maria Gyure and Judy Brown, and supported outreach, networkingactivities and conferences. Our goals for the ISG include broadening the genomics expertise and capacity, supporting innovative research and training initiative, and bringing international recognition toour faculty and institutions. Brenton Graveley will continue his service asAssociate Director for the ISG, serving asscientific liaison with our members atUCONN Health, the state legislators in Hartford, and our Jackson Laboratory partners.
