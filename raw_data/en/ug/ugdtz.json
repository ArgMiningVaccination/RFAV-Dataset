I'm Dr. Alison Finger, ND, a naturopathic doctor, and I founded the Doylestown Natural Medicine Center because I believe that healthcare is about so much more than managing symptoms. It's about seeing you as a whole person and creating an individualized plan for your health that meets you where you are and helps you get where you want to be. It's about combining ancient, natural modalities with modern technology and science to support you in bringing balance and vitality to your life. Most of all, it's about relationships. My team and I are here to guide and support you in reclaiming your health. That makes you part of our community and connects you with others who are learning how to transform their lives through natural medicine. Fatigue. Weight issues. Mood swings. Struggles with blood pressure or blood sugar. Digestive problems. All of these things can sap our ability to enjoy our lives and be as active and engaged as we want to be. They are also all symptoms of imbalances in the body. When all we do is manage the symptoms, the underlying cause goes unaddressed, and we never really get to that space of health and vitality we want. That's where naturopathic medicine steps in. As a naturopathic doctor, I'm trained as a primary care doctor who specializes in natural medicine. That means I see you as a whole person, not just a condition or a collection of symptoms. I'll work with you to develop an individualized plan that gets at the root cause of the imbalance so your body doesn't just mask the symptoms any more\u2014it stops producing them, because you've been restored to your proper balance. I use diet, supplements, lifestyle changes, and other natural modalities to address your illness in the most gentle way to allow you to find balance in both body and mind. So, what would you do if you had more control over your health than you thought you did? How would it feel to break that cycle of symptom flare ups and enjoy a freer, healthier life? Let's find out together. "}
