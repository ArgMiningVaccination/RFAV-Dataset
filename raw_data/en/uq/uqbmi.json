In addition to one-on-one counseling Nathalie has also worked at Weill Cornell Medical College and New York Presbyterian Hospital. The relationship between food, emotion, science, and spirituality is complex. Nathalie's background in psychology has provided her with the tools for the deep psychological exploration that is needed to accompany intensive nutrition therapy for true success. Nathalie not only has a strong science foundation, but she has a unique understanding of the connection between the mind and the body, and absolutely loves good food! Nathalie is the founder of Nutrition by Nathalie LLC and All Good Eats, a social media health and wellness brand focusing on healthy, practical recipes and leading a clean, holistic lifestyle. When she isn't working with her clients or on media projects, you can find Nathalie working out, experimenting with new recipes in the All Good Eats Kitchen, or traveling with her husband, baby boy, and mini-aussie! \"I've seen a few nutritionists before coming to Nathalie and each have helped me to meet some short term goals, however when I met Nathalie she helped me to completely reshape my thinking of how food affects my body and the way I feel every day\" - Kim C NUTRITIONAL COUNSELING A comprehensive nutrition program customized just for you.
