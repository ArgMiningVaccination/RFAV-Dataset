More about aromatherapy Aromatherapy and essential oils have been used throughout the ages. Until the late 19th century aromatherapy and the use of essential oils were considered a discipline of medicine. Incense, ointments and oils were all made from plant by holistic healers. Aromatherapy is one of our oldest, non-invasive health disciplines. Scent have an effect on our mind and body; they can evoke memories, stimulate feeling and arouse the senses. Certain essential oils have the ability to relax, stimulate, or create balance between the body and mind. An essential oil's aroma is picked up by the olfactory nerve located in the back of our nose and then carried to the brain where is can have an effect on the senses. Scent can stimulate an emotional response due to their direct impact on the limbic system, which processes our memories, emotions and feelings.

We go to great lengths to ensure that every oil we produce is brought to you in a manner that's both scientifically and environmentally responsible. USB Cable included, power adapter not included.
