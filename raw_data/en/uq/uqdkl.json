Make a bath mixture. Here's a pared-down version of a recipe I share in my book, [Sleep Rituals](https://healingbrave.com/collections/books/products/sleep-rituals). Combine these ingredients in a mixing bowl: - 1/4 cup [Epsom salt](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004N7DQHA/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=aimhappy-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B004N7DQHA&linkId=ce3b76ef1840c564a53a3d7fbf69c118) - 1/4 cup [Himalayan salt](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HVJI7KI/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=aimhappy-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00HVJI7KI&linkId=fc76aa9c163396e6ef8a4f0df861930f)or [dead sea salt](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GITYJU/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=aimhappy-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B004GITYJU&linkId=627666b970241ff63320041343f0bf01) - 1/4 cup powdered milk of choice (if you don't have this, put 1 cup full-fat milk to the side) - 2 tablespoons ground oats (oat flour) - 2 tablespoons [rose petals](https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/products/pink-roses/profile), fresh or dried (optional) - 5 drops [rose essential oil](https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/products/rose-chinese-essential-oil/profile)(optional) Scoop dried ingredients into a large tea filter or several small filters. Organza bags or even clean socks you don't wear anymore will work, as long as they don't have holes where the toes used to be. 3. Run yourself a bath. Add your bath tea bag/mixture to the running water and gently squeeze or swirl to help dissolve. 4. Write down what you love. While the water is running, take out a piece of paper and a pen. Stand, sit on a towel, or pull in a chair for this. Write down a few things you love about your life, this moment, yourself, someone or something else. Be simple or detailed. One word or several sentences. Whatever you write, feel it. When you feel like you've finished, place your love notes aside. 5. Bathe in love. When your bath is ready, step in with these words of love on your mind. Enter the water as if it, itself, is a pool of love. Sink into this healing space. Thank yourself for this time to rest. While bathing, you can do a candle gazing meditation: with the candle at least a few feet from you, watch the flame with a relaxed gaze, using the flame as a focal point when any stray thoughts come up. Think about what you wrote down. Then, let the specifics fade away, into the candle's flame and into the ether. Rest your attention on this one word: love. Let it be a feeling experience more than a thinking one. Close your eyes. Feel your body in the tub, in the water. Consider how your body gives you the chance to feel this -- all of it. To experience this life. To breathe, to laugh, to cry, to cleanse yourself at the end of the day. This water is a body of love. You are a body of love. And you're the love that permeates this body, this home, this earth, this everything. Wondering if you're love is like the ocean wondering if it's water. 6. Self-massage. After about 20-30 minutes, end your bath and lightly pat your skin dry. Apply your favorite body oil: jojoba, coconut, grapeseed, almond, and other oils offer their own benefits. Stay away from what you might be sensitive to, obviously. I love [Morrocco Method's Euro Oil](https://www.morroccoaffiliate.com/aff.php?id=1220&url=899) for hair and body. As you massage the oil in, take your time. Enjoy your candles, music, and lights. Make it a simple, final act of thanks and care for the body that got you through this, and every other day. 7. Rest in love. Love top of mind, go through the rest of your night a little less tense. A little softer than you felt before, mind and body. Make a cup of tea with honey, color, or read a book (nothing too stimulating -- my book [Sleep Affirmations helps a lot](https://healingbrave.com/collections/books/products/sleep-affirmations) of people chill out). All that's left to do today is rest in the love you brought to the surface. Rest. Love. Repeat as needed. . . . Tell me: What's your favorite way to end the day on a positive note? Tell me in the comments. I ready every single one, and I'd love to know! Don't go to bed without reminding yourself... that you ARE love. It feels so good to remember. Love, Jen P.S.
