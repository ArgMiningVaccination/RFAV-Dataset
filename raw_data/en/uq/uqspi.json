Since this is still a new disease, you likely have lots of questions about it. Many of the common questions about coronavirus are answered here, and though there's still a lot that scientists don't know about this disease, more is being discovered each day.

Most of these viruses cause the common cold and are very prevalent. Less common strains of coronavirus also cause Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which are serious variations of the virus. [[2]](#_note-2)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital [Go to source](#)COVID-19 is a new, rare type of coronavirus that came to the public's attention in late 2019. [[3]](#_note-3)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)World Health Organization Health information and news provided by the World Health Organization [Go to source](#) Advertisement - The coronavirus we are currently dealing with is novel, meaning that it hasn't been seen in people before. - COVID-19 is a term for the respiratory syndrome that can be caused by this new coronavirus, meaning that it causes you to have difficulty breathing. In some cases, it can cause pneumonia. What are the symptoms of COVID-19? - Most people who get COVID-19 have few to no symptoms. You might think you have a cold or the flu and be better in a few days. However, up to 1 in 5 people who get coronavirus will become seriously ill and may have trouble breathing. Symptoms to watch for include: [[4]](#_note-4)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals [Go to source](#) - Fever - Cough - Shortness of breath - Difficulty breathing Tip: If you have these symptoms but have not been in close contact with anyone who has COVID-19, you probably just have a cold or the flu. However, it's still a good idea to isolate yourself until your symptoms have passed. If you get COVID-19, are you going to die? - Not likely. Although it is more deadly than the flu, most people recover or have only mild cases. However, COVID-19 can be very dangerous for patients who are elderly or have other chronic diseases or conditions. [[5]](#_note-5)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health [Go to source](#) EXPERT TIP - Compared to SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), another coronavirus, COVID-19 is more easily transmissible but not nearly as deadly.
