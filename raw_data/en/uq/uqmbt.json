Inserting the fine needles into specific points, known as acupuncture points, on the meridians is believed to stimulate the body's own healing responses and help restore its natural balance. Incorporating Acupuncture into another treatment by introducing only one or a few needles during the treatment can greatly increase relaxation of the client. People often find that acupuncture can lead to increased energy levels, better sleep and a sense of good health, as well as helping their specific problem. Nutrition and Lifestyle Instruction Integrated into the Chinese Medical system is a focus on finding and living a balanced and happy life. Diet, Sleep, Exercise and Mindset: These four pillars, especially in our modern world, are a major key to finding that balanced and happy life. As Chinese Medicine is an individualized medicine, an acupuncturist may help patients look at specific areas of their life. This may include: Finding balance in eating habits and food choices, possibly suggesting herbal formulas. Taking a look at sleep hygiene. Recommending fitness regimens such as yoga, Tai Chi, Qigong and even cardio and strength training. And most importantly, working to cultivate a positive mindset to mitigate stress and find emotional wellbeing. Gua Sha Similar to cupping gua sha is an adjunct technique used prior to or following acupuncture to treat not only muscular pain but a variety of health issues. In gua sha a tool is used on the skin in a scraping like motion. Usually a massage oil or liniment is applied prior. And, like cupping there can be some bruise like discoloration which appears on the skin above the injured areas causing pain. This discoloration usually lasts 3 to 5 days following. Tui Na Tuina or tui-na (pronounced twee-nah) massage originated in ancient China and is believed to be the oldest system of bodywork. It's one of the four main branches of traditional Chinese medicine, along with acupuncture, qi gong and Chinese herbal medicine. Tuina massage stimulates the flow of qi to promote balance and harmony within the body using many of the same principles of acupuncture. It's similar to acupuncture in the way it targets specific acupoints, but practitioners use fingers instead of needles to apply pressure to stimulate these points. Tuina massage is often used in combination with acupuncture. "}
