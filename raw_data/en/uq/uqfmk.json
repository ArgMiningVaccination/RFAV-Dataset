F.L.Abstract Cellular senescence is a typical tumor suppressive mechanism that restricts the pro- liferation of premalignant cells. However, mounting evidence suggests that senes- cent cells, which also persist in vivo , can promote the incidence of aging related disorders principally via the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP), among which cancer is particularly devastating. Despite the beneficial effects of the SASP on certain physiological events such as wound healing and tissue repair, more studies have demonstrated that senescent cells can substantially contribute to pathological conditions and accelerate disease exacerbation, particularly cancer resis- tance, relapse and metastasis. To limit the detrimental properties while retaining thebeneficial aspects of senescent cells, research advancements that support screening, design and optimization of anti aging therapeutic agents are in rapid progress in the setting of prospective development of clinical strategies, which together represent anew wave of efforts to control human malignancies or mitigate degenerative compli- cations.

Aging Cell published by the Anatomical Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Received: 22 August 2018 |Revised: 9 October 2018 |Accepted: 15 associated galactosidase (SA Gal) activity (Ozcan et al., 2016). However, senescent cells are frequently implicated in multiple disorders, mainly through secretion of numerous bioactive molecules, a distinctive phenomenon found a decade ago and ter- med as the senescence associated secretory et al., 2008). Thefull SASP spectrum comprises a myriad of soluble factors including proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and pro- teases, whose functional involvement can be classified into severalaspects including but not limited to extracellular matrix formation, metabolic processes, ox redox events and gene expression regulation (Ozcan et al., 2016). The SASP promotes embryonic development, tissue repair and wound healing, serving as an evolutionarily adapted mechanism in maintaining tissue and /or organ homeostasis (Davaapil, Brockes, & Yun, 2017; Demaria et & Lau, 2010;Munoz Espin et al., 2013; Storer et al., 2013). Senescent cells com- municate with their surrounding environment by expressing theSASP, with the potential to boost immune surveillance by mounting specific inflammatory responses including those mediated by CD4 +T cells against antigens expressed in senescent cells, particularly thoseobserved in premalignant lesions (Georgilis et al., 2018; Kang et al., 2011; Toso et al., 2014). Although the SASP is beneficial to severalhealth associated events, more evidence has showed that it actively contributes to the formation of a pro carcinogenic tumor microenvi- ronment (TME). Long term secretion of the SASP factors by senes- cent cells can impair the functional integrity of adjacent normal cellsin the local tissue, serving as a major cause of chronic inflammation which drives aging related degeneration of multiple organs (He & Sharpless, 2017). Thus, senescent cells and their unique phenotype,the SASP, can be defined as a form of antagonistic pleiotropy, aproperty that is beneficial in early life and during tissue turnover, but deleterious over time with advanced age, making both mechanis-tic investigation and therapeutic intervention of paramount signifi- cance in current era of precision medicine. As the SASP can generate contrasting pathophysiological conse- quences, substantial interest has been sparked in recent years to achieve an accurate and thorough understanding of this cell nonau- tonomous phenotype. In cancer patients, the most frequentlyobserved formats of cellular senescence encompass oncogene in- duced senescence (OIS) and therapy induced senescence (TIS) (Sie- ben, Sturmlechner, Sluis, & Deursen, 2018) (Figure 1). Indeed, bothmodalities are initially tumor suppressive, but later tend to manifest a pro tumorigenic capacity by substantially activating the DNA dam- age response (DDR), which once perceived irreparable by the dam-aged cells can potently induce the SASP (Rodier et al., 2011). It is now clear that regulation of the initiation and development of the SASP involves multiple signaling pathways, including those to act post transcrip- tionally, most SASP regulators converge on two transcription factors, NFB and C /EBP, which co regulate many SASP components (Di Mitri & Alimonti, 2016). Furthermore, some interleukins (ILs) are encoded by the SASP but can reciprocally modulate the SASP by feedback mechanisms, such as IL6, IL 8 and IL 1(Di Mitri & Ali- monti, 2016). Although activation of DNA damage response (DDR) isessential for the induction and maintenance of senescence (Rodier et al., 2009, 2011 ), the precise regulatory mechanism directly linking the DDR events to the SASP development remains largely unclear FIGURE 1 Oncogene and therapy induced cellular senescence. (a) oncogene induced senescence (OIS) represents a cell responsive program provoked upon aberrant activation of specific oncogenes such as Ras, Raf, Akt, Cyclin E and c Myc (Acosta & Gil, 2012; Ko et al., 2018; Warnier et al., 2018). OIS results from the enforcement of a DDR triggered by DNA hyper replication induced by oncogene expression, a process that is initially transient but ultimately ends with the permanent establishment of cellular senescence (Di Micco et al., 2006). In such a case, persistent DDR events are observed in senescent cells, and molecules such as ATM/ATR, Nbs1 and Chk2 are actively engaged in DDR associated signaling. Regulation of the SASP is subject to multiple intracellular pathways including but not 2015; Toso et al., 2014), which inevitably converge on transcription factors such asNFB, C/EBP and AP 1 (Han et al., 2018; Ito et al., 2017). Recent studies revealed that GATA4 is an upstream modulator of NF B signaling in senescent cells, while the chromatin reader protein BRD4 dynamically binds to super enhancer elements adjacent to the genes encoding SASP factors (Kang et al., 2015; Tasdemir et al., 2016). As different cell types show different responses to oncogenic stress, the relevantmechanisms dictating the sensitivity or resistance to a specific oncogene remain to be elucidated by future investigations. (b) Therapy induced senescence (TIS) can be typically induced in normal, immortal or transformed, and cancer cells by anticancer compounds or ionizing radiation.Although generally considered tumor suppressive, TIS has recently been demonstrated by multiple studies to be able to enhance cancerresistance, relapse and metastasis by causing diverse cytotoxicity related side effects including an in vivo form of the SASP (Chen et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2017; Mikula Pietrasik et al., 2016; Wieland et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018). Furthermore, experimental data suggested that TIS induced by genotoxic chemotherapy promotes cancer metastasis from primary sites to distant organs (Demaria et al., 2017). It is imaginablethat similar consequences could be observed in cancer clinics, a process driven by senescent cells with the tendency to promote malignantprogression in the post treatment stage, particularly cancer metastasis. We also raise the possibility of assaying typical SASP factors in peripheral blood of cancer patients for appraisal of treatment outcome and prognosis of disease exacerbation, a significant and innovativestrategy of the SASP based pathological assessment that may be realized in future medicine.

Briefly, cGAS is a highly conserved cytosolic DNA sensor, which can be activated once bound by double stranded DNA released from genome instability induced micronuclei, a process that engages a second messenger cGMP AMP (cGAMP), which subse- quently triggers the adaptor protein STING to recruit TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and I B kinase to activate IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF B, respectively, causing the production of type I interferons and expression of numerous SASP factors (Dou et al., 2017; Gluck et al., 2017; Mackenzie et al., 2017; Yang, Wang, Ren, Chen, & Chen, 2017). However, how the cGAS STING pathway is functionally connected with other SASP modulators including but not limited to p38MAPK, Jak2 /Stat3 and GATA4, remains an open question that merits future exploration. Given the remarkable com-plexity of the SASP signaling, further experimental inputs are essen- tial to achieve new insights and to present optimal molecules for therapeutic targeting of such a distinctive phenotype. In clinical medicine, anticancer agents not only triggers significant apoptosis of cancer cells but also causes substantial damage in the TME and induces typical TIS of the resident stromal cells, which cause therapeutic resistance via secretion of the SASP factors (Chen et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2012, 2016 ). Interestingly, damage provoked SASP can also be restrained to preserve tissue homeostasis and pre- vent chronic inflammation, as suggested by recent study that revealed PI3K /Akt/mTOR pathway as a molecular rheostat to control the SASP progression (Bent, Gilbert, & Hemann, 2016). Indeed, aTMEspecific stress response is engaged promptly upon cellular dam- age particularly those induced by genotoxic insults, and stromal cellsexhibit an acute stress associated phenotype (ASAP) characterized by subsequent secretion of a small handful of soluble factors includ-ing IL 6 and Timp 1 (Gilbert & Hemann, 2010). In contrast to the ASAP as a rapid response mainly involving the ATM TRAF6 TAK1 axis, the SASP is a relatively chronic process governed by key signal-ing nodes such as TAK1, a central kinase that functionally mediates phenotypic transition from the ASAP to the SASP and holds remark- able potential as an optimal therapeutic target to manipulate the SASP with a higher efficacy than that of p38 or mTOR oriented suppression (Zhang et al., 2018). A new function of the SASP was recently discovered, which is linked with increased expression of stem cell markers and ker-atinocyte plasticity upon short term exposure of cells to the SASP in vitro and liver regeneration of a treatment inducible OIS mouse model in vivo , thus raising the possibility that transient therapeutic delivery of senescent cells could be harnessed to promote tissueregeneration (Ritschka et al., 2017). Interestingly, another study used agent inducible senescence animal trimethylation of lysine histone H3 (H3K9me3) or p53 to simulate spontaneousescape from cellular senescence, and found that cells released from senescence can re enter cell cycle with pronouncedly enhanced stemness and Wnt dependent growth potential compared to identi- cal cell populations exposed to same chemotherapy but withoutexperiencing senescence (Milanovic et al., 2018). Thus, senescence associated reprogramming promotes cancer stemness (senescence associated stemness, or SAS), a distinct property that has profoundimplications for cancer therapy and presents new mechanisticinsights into cancer cell plasticity. Partially resembling cancer cells which pose substantial threat to human lifespan, senescent cells are functionally involved in tumor progression and can be viable targets for some reasons. First, senescent cells share common biochemical features, allowing use of a single therapeutic agent to eliminate them from the tissue microenvironment. Second, new protocols targeting senescent cells could practically synergize with hitherto established or proposed anticancer programs, which are frequently based on a presenescence scenario (Acosta & Gil, 2012). Given that manychemotherapeutics induces collateral senescence in the TME, phar- maceutical agents targeting senescent cells can be a key component of advanced anticancer arsenal (Childs et al., 2017). However, is there a way to radically remove senescent cells in the damaged or aged tissue rather than merely inhibition of the SASP, so that long term drug administration can be circumvented? Several recent studies provided a series of pilot evidence in specific clearing senescent cells, including single or dual treatment ofsenescent cells with quercetin /dasatinib, and pan BCL inhibition (Chang et al., 2016; Yosef et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2015). Frequently detected in fruits and vegetables, quercetin is nat-ural product and beneficial against aging, as evidenced by its capac- ity in attenuating premature senescence of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in Hutchinson Gilford progeria syndrome and postponing physiological aging of hMSCs in Werner syndrome (Geng et al., 2018). Dasatinib is a suppressor of Src kinase family and has showed prominent efficacy for some cancer types including chronic myeloid leukemia and colon cancer (Benthani et al., 2018; Naqvi et al., 2018). The senolytic cocktail consisting of dasatinib and quer- cetin reduces the number of naturally occurring senescent cells inexplants of human adipose tissue, while intermittent oral administra- tion of senolytics to either senescent cell implanted young animals or naturally aged mice can alleviate physical dysfunction and extendposttreatment survival (Xu et al., 2018). However, both compounds (dasatinib and quercetin) were considered to be nonspecific amongtypes of senescent cells and can display cell type dependent effects (Zhu et al., 2015). Given the prominent efficacy of the senolyticcocktail in controlling aging related symptoms as demonstrated in multiple lines of experimental mice including those of an immunode-ficient or immunocompetent background, and in human adipose tis- sue explants (Ogrodnik et al., 2017; Schafer et al., 2017; Xu et al.,2018), a comprehensive and practical use of these compounds as clinical senolytics upon systemic evaluation is intriguing for future medicine. In addition, BCL inhibitors or BH3 mimetic drugs appeared to be an alternative group of agents against senescent cells by specifically targeting multiple BCL family members including BCl 2, BCLxl, and BCL w (Chang et al., et al., 2016).

ABT263 has been extensively applied with success in treatment of human malignancies including lymphoma and multiple solid tumors; while another BCL inhibitorABT737 has experienced an ex vivo evaluation in ovarian tumor sam- ples (Lheureux et al., 2015). Unfortunately, a major drawback ofBCLtargeting agents merits attention, which predominantly results from their pronounced cytotoxicity, especially BCL 2 inhibitors such as ABT263 and ABT199 (also venetoclax), the strong apoptosis inducers that pose a substantial risk to most cell types. Although applicable for immediate life threatening conditions including advanced malignancies, off target damage should be avoided inten- tionally for cancer patients and those at high age. Despite the antise-nescence potential of these agents, future studies should be able to address whether further optimization is technically feasible or more selective agents can be designed, the latter ideally targeting intracel- lular molecules /pathways that are specifically up or down regulated in senescent cells and are inherently correlated with their survival.To date, several senolytic molecules have been identified that show promising potency and selectivity such as a D retro inverso (DRI) peptide that perturbs FOXO4 interaction of senescent cells (Baar et al., 2017). Further- more, utilization of these \"firstgeneration \"senolytic strategies in preclinical models is disease minimizing, presumably through attenua- tion of the SASP. This implies that diseases associated with senes-cent cells, such as cancer, may be amenable to senotherapy mediated by agents that are in currently ongoing clinical trials but have the potential to be exploited as modulators or eliminators of senescent cells (Table 1). Cellular senescence occurs throughout lifespan, and senescent cells are beneficial to certain physiological and pathological pro- cesses including embryonic patterning, tissue repair, wound healing and immune surveillance. However, as address above, a steady accu-mulation of senescent cells in the tissue has adverse consequences, ultimately enhancing clinical morbidity. Thus, the abundance of senescent cells in vivo may serve as a \"molecular \"marker for disease occurrence and guide patient stratification (Demaria et al., 2017), anovel approach for clinical advancement which can be correlated with benefit of senotherapy. Despite all the recent findings from senescence and cancer research, there are several caveats before we move forward. Agents targeting senescent cells, especially SASP inhibitors, should be inves- tigated meticulously to ensure continued maintenance of cell cycle arrest, as bypassing the crisis can inevitably promote carcinogenesis.As senescent cells also have certain health promoting functions, identification of the beneficial components of the SASP could leadto development of optimal strategies that preserve vital factors while depleting their detrimental counterparts derived from senescent cells. As a technical issue, achieving the balance between deleterious and beneficial impact of senolytics in cancer patients requires careful and rational design of administration regimens such as classic chemotherapy followed by senolytic treatment, each provided in metronomic cycles to minimize in vivo toxicity but enhancing overall efficacy. Such a therapeutic modality is desirable and holds thepotential to enhance patient treatment efficacy while reducing adverse side effects that can be observed upon administration of each agent in a single dose. Finally, targeting senescent cells whilesimultaneously promoting tissue regeneration represents an optimal solution to remove senescent cells from individuals particularly those with advanced diseases or at later stage in life. In doing so, we are getting even closer to achieving the goal of a real \"healthy \"therapy against human cancer and aging. CONFLICT OF INTEREST None Declared.
