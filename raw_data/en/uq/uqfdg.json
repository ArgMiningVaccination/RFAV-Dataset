Physically and emotionally, the soul needs to be touched through understanding, meeting people where they are at, and holding them in a space where they can come into a place of calm homeostasis and healing. There has never been a better time to seek an education in massage and the healing arts than now because we have been isolated for so long that we now understand how connection and human interaction is such an important part of the human psyche.\" - Joel Hamilton, SWIHA Associate Dean of On-Campus Education The world is moving into a more holistic approach of mind, body, spirit when it comes to healing, eating, and other qualities of life. Doctors are beginning to recommend more holistic modalities such as massage therapy, to patients in addition to or in substitute of medical procedures and treatments. About 30% of consumers who got a massage in 2020 for health and wellness reasons state it was part of a treatment plan from a doctor/medical provider (AMTA, 2021). With the absurd year that 2020 was, it is understandable that more of the population became stressed and had the self-realization that they needed to work on their health and wellness. The need for more people to get into [massage school](https://swiha.edu/arizona-massage-school/) to meet the ever-increasing demand from the public, franchises, spas, and other employers have never been more important. During the past few years, people have not been touched as they kept their social distancing from others. [Human touch](https://swiha.edu/massage-programs/) is a basic human need, as our bodies come to a state of homeostasis when we are held. This has been lacking in so many people's lives who are in need of healing. Never forget that our hearts direct our intention and our path in life and passion. Dive headfirst into your massage education if you are being guided to be a healer of others. [There are endless possibilities in massage therapy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-v-8pTq735g&t=2s), and you have the power to mold it into the career you have always wanted. Joel Hamilton's grandfather used to tell him growing up, \"It's important to recognize that 80% of success is just showing up and doing what comes your way. If we live in fear and don't show up for life then we are going to get left behind and not ever realize the place that our passion can take us.\" Don't let your passion slip away from you. Take hold of it and create the life that YOU want to live!
