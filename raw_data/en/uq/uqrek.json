Organizers of the demonstration said in a letter that the demonstration shows \"of our community standing for freedom\" against Gov. J.B. Pritzker's mandates \"that are crippling our education system.\" In late August, Pritzker announced vaccine mandates for preschool through 12th-grade teachers and staff, higher education personnel, higher education students, and healthcare workers in a variety of settings like hospitals, nursing homes, urgent care and doctor's offices. Those who refused to get vaccinated by the September 19 deadline have been subject to COVID-19 testing. \"The community members who participated in the shoe demonstration are defending our education system and the people who are part of it by standing together against these mandates and the forced compliance being imposed upon them,\" the organizers said in the letter. Participants of the demonstration also left flyers and posters on the door of District 47's administration office. \"Stop forcing teachers to choose between their jobs and unlawful mandate! Freedom not force,\" one poster read. \"What is right for you, may not be right for me. What is right for me, may not be right for you. But what is not right for either of us is being stripped of the freedom to choose what is right for ourselves,\" a second poster read.
