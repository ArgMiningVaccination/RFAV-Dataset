Hypertension and its complications are estimated to cause 9.4 million deaths every year (Lims et al. 2012). More than 80% of these deaths occur in low and middle income countries. Mortality from hypertension and its complications are projected to increase if current prevalence rates persist (Global burden of Disease, 2008). The increasing mortality from hypertension and its complications especially in low and middle income countries attest to the growing importance of hypertension as a major global health threat (Awuah et al, 2016; Walker, 2000). WHO projects that Africa will experience the largest increase in mortality from CVDs in the next few years (WHO,2013). The rising burden of hypertension in Ghana is similar to the African situation. Over a twenty-year period, there was a tenfold increase in new cases of hypertension from 49,087 in 1988 to 505,180 in 2007 recorded in public health facilities across the country (Bosu, 2014). A review of population based studies in Ghana showed a high prevalence of hypertension ranging from 19.3% in rural areas to 54.6% in some urban areas (Addo et al. 2012). Hypertension is the 5th most important 2 cause of outpatient morbidity nationally. In the Greater Accra Region (where the reported study was conducted) however, hypertension is the second major cause of outpatient morbidity, next to Malaria. The rising burden of hypertension in Ghana is compounded by poor control (Awuah et al, 2014; Bosu, 2014; Addo et al, 2012). The protracted polarized model of the epidemiological transition suggests disadvantaged groups such as urban poor communities are at a greater risk of the combined effect of infectious and chronic diseases (Frenk et al. 1989, Agyei-Mensah and de-Graft Aikins, 2010). In addition to the double impact of chronic and infectious diseases, poorer communities experience health inequalities at multiple levels (Nilunger et al. 2004), from individual level factors (personal beliefs about health, low income, low level of education, actual behaviour, presentation, risk assessment etc.) to access and utilization of quality health care services. Furthermore, health systems in many African countries are struggling to cope with the double burden of infectious and chronic diseases (de-Graft Aikins et al, 2010). The vacuum created by weak biomedical health systems is filled by competitive alternative health systems, including traditional herbal medicine and faith healing systems, which offer unregulated and often iatrogenic treatments. A complex interaction of these factors leads to high morbidity and mortality from a potentially preventable condition like hypertension. This study a ims to explore the health seeking behaviour of people living with hypertension in two urban poor communities in Accra. Theoretically, it is informed by the concepts of explanatory models (Kleinman, 1980) and illness action (de-Graft Aikins, 2005 ). The examination of the community context of hypertension is informed by neighbourhood research (Al-Taiar et al. 2010; Noor, 2006 ). 3 Examining explanatory models and illness action Kleinman (1980) describes different domains of chronic disease treatment and management. The study defined the professional sector as treatment and management of a disease within formal biomedical system whereas the popular sector referred to management outside the formal system. He defined treatment within ethno-medical or herbal systems of healthcare as folk sector treatments. The study observed that the popular sector constituted an important aspect of chronic disease management because this was the domain where the condition is first encountered. In addition, chronic disease management is deeply connected to the individual lives of people which is largely influenced by popular sector activities. Many qualitative studies on hypertension in Africa have applied Kleinman's framework (Buene et al. 2008; Buene et al. 2006, Boutin-Foster, 2007; Connell, 2005 ). In a study of diabetes experiences in rural and urban Ghana, de-Graft Aikins (2005) demonstrated that health seeking within Africa's pluralistic medical context was not only driven by representations of disease and illness but also the high cost of treatment and psychosocial impac t of the lived condition. de-Graft Aikins (2015) observed that people living with diabetes privileged biomedical systems over ethno-medical and faith systems of health care. The use of non- biomedical healing systems was often a product of the high cost of biomedical care and a lack of access to biomedical health services. de-Graft Aikins (2005) categorized health seeking practices into four types of illness actions: biomedical action, spiritual action, cure seeking (passive and active) and medi cal inaction. Biomedical action relates to seeking health through the formal biomedical or hospital system. Spiritual action constituted a passive disconnection from the formal biomedical system and a 4 reliance on (Christian) faith. Cure seeking involved healer shopping between biomedicine, faith and ethno-medicine with the intention of curing the condition. Healer shopping is defined as \"the use of a second healer without referral from the first for a single episode of disease .\" (de-Graft Aikins, 2005; Kroeger,1983) The illness action interpretive approach mapped health seeking behaviours in a pluralistic medical environment. The utility of this approach in the African context has been supported by subsequent studies in Tanzania (Kolling et al, 2010), South Africa (Goudge 2009) and regional studies on Africa (Levit, 2008, Candib, 2007). However, the illness action concept has been applied to the study of diabetes, which is fundamentally different from hypertension. Assessment of the health environment While important contributions of the different health care systems have long been recognized, a comprehensive assessment of the health environment incorporating all the elements of the popular sector has not been fully assessed. A few studies on accessibility have looked at physical accessibility measures to major hospitals calculated within distances and travel times to major health facilities (Al-Taiar et al. 2010; Noor, 2006; O'Meara et al. 2009; Branford et al, 2012). Measured distances and travel times to major biomedical facilities assess opportunities of health care available within those measured geographical distances. While this is an important contribution, the focus on one type of health care system is limited in contexts where individuals use different systems of healthcare sequentially or simultaneously. The limited focus may in part be due to non-availability of readily available data on geographic locations of small clinics, pharmacies, chemist shops, churches, shrines and herbalist shops which define the popular and folk sector of health and healing in many parts of the Africa. The lack of a proper address system (Weeks et al, 2012) further complicates identification and location of these 5 health facilities. These data challenges limit our understanding of how individuals navigate pluralistic medical systems in search of treatment or cures. In high income countries, a strong body of work exists on neighbourhoods as a spatial unit of analysis in more advanced countries (Weeks, 2009). The second aim of this study was to draw on the existing methods to explore the community context of hypertension control paying attention to all the different systems of health care found in the community and how respondents use them on daily basis to control hypertension. Jamestown and Usshertown provide a unique opportunity to study the main types of health care systems and their utility within a limited geographic boundary. Jamestown and Usshertown are bordered to the South by the Atlantic Ocean and to the East by the Korle Lagoon, to the North of the two communities is the central business district of Accra. To the West of these communities is a constellation of high street banks. These two communities are essentially situated betwee n two natural borders and two man-made borders. This provides the perfect opportunity to study the neighbourhood context of health systems and how people living with hypertension interact with these systems. Methodology This is a follow up study on respondents previously identified to be living with hypertension in a broader community health and poverty survey in three urban poor communities in Accra: Jamestown, Usshertown and Agbogbloshie. Description of Parent Study The Regional Institute for Population Studies (RIPS) has established an active study site in three urban poor communities in Accra: Jamestown, Usshertown and Agbogbloshie. This field site was established with funding from The Secretariat of African Caribbean and Pacific group of States (ACP) ACP- EU Cooperation program in higher education (EDULINK) and International 6 Development Research Centre (IDRC). The objective of the \"Urban Health and Poverty Survey\" was to study vital health, poverty and development indicators over time. RIPS has conducted three rounds of EDULINK following the same respondents from 2010 to 2013 every 18-20 months. The first round of EDULINK was conducted in 2010 (June), the second round in 2011(December) and the 2013 (September). In the first round of EDULINK, 497 households and 736 individuals were included in the study. In the Second round, 806 households and 947 individuals were included in the second round of the EDULINK longitudinal survey. The third round of EDULINK included 788 individuals and 675 households. In the first round of EDULINK survey, subjective data was collected on the health status of all respondents including chronic disease status. In the second round, objective anthropometric measurements such as weight and height to calculate BMI and blood pressure measurement data was gathered in addition to the subjective health measurements. In the third round, blood sample data was gathered from a random sample of respondents in the study. Qualitative data collection Qualitative interviews were conducted by trained interviewe rs. Thirty individuals previously identified as living with hypertension in the EDULINK surveys were included in the study. The interview guide focused on five core thematic areas: causes, severity, duration, knowledge of complications, management and general notions of health and illness. Informed consent was obtained during the quantitative initial survey. The interviews lasted between 50 minutes to 90 minutes. Interviews were conducted in Ga (the dominant local language in the community), Twi and English. All interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Interviews were conducted in the homes of individuals. 7 Qualitative Analysis Each transcript was coded distinctly, respondent's ideas and explanatory models on hypertension management and treatment were identified and coded. Codes generated from all transcripts were compared against each other. Similar ideas relating to the hypertension management and explanatory models from all transcripts were assigned the same codes. An exhaustive list of codes was generated from this constant comparison process of generating ideas and codes from different transcripts. A thematic framework (Table 1.6) summarises the codes generated by all transcripts. The columns in Table 1.6 describes codes generated per each transcript while the rows display the frequency of a particular code across all transcripts. Codes relating to the same behaviour and explanatory model were grouped under one major behavioural theme. On the basis of this, complex behavioural patterns of health seeking behaviour were systematically identified. For instance, some respondents relied solely on biomedical management, codes relating to this behaviour and explanations are classified under one major organizing theme called biomedical management. Another group of respondents expressed dissatisfaction and negative experiences with the biomedical health system, the codes identified a different treatment and explanatory behaviour al pattern for this group. Between these two groups, some respondents self-regulated and independently determined what treatments worked best for them at particular points in time, this group was also classified according to how they responded to hypertension treatment. Each of these categories of respondents had a different attitude and acted differently in terms of treatment seeking behaviour. The qualitative analysis thus emphasised the differences in individual treatment 8 and subsequent health seeking behaviour of each respondent. The analysis was informed by the concepts of explanatory models (Kleinman, 1980) and illness action (de-Graft Aikins,2005). Two types of data visualisation technics were used. The First is a word cloud which displays the most frequently occurring words in a data corpus. The word cloud used in this analysis however is created from coded words that refer directly to health seeking behaviours of the 30 respondents included in this qualitative study. Each strategy used by a respondent is coded once for that particular respondent no matter how many times it was mentioned in the interview. The size of each word therefore corresponds to the number of times that particular strategy has been applied across all 30 interviews. The second visualisation technic used was a tree map. The colour and siz e of the rectangular show the code frequency amongst respondents. A continuous spectrum of colours from green (more dominant codes) to red (less dominant codes) show the level of code dominance across respondents. A green rectangular show dominant themes or more frequently mentioned health seeking behaviours. Three tree maps have been created each for biomedica l health strategies, ethno-medical and faith healing strategies. Eventually all the tree maps are combined to show overall health seeking behaviour among st all thirty respondents in picture 1.9. The same colour scheme and proportional rectangular box sizes have been adopted for easy comparison across all the different types of strategies. Geographic Accessibility The community was assessed for the organization of plural health care systems. Health care systems were defined by respondents. Any facility used by a respondent with the intention of managing hypertension was considered a health care system and therefore included in the analysis. Seven types of facilities were generated by respondents: clinics, pharmacies, chemist shops, shrines, churches, mosques and herbal facilities. All the health care facilities were first identified 9 within the community and geocoded. Specifically, the counts, identification and location of all health care facilities operating within the community were mapped. The house point locations of all 30 respondents were also taken to access the distance relationship between community health care facilities and respondents. The mean centre function in Arch GIS 10.2 was used to calculate the geographic centre of the respondents. The mean centre was used to protect the anonymity of the respondents as all maps were drawn to scale. In addition, the mean centre gave the relative position of the respondents which made it easy to calculate access to other facilities in the community. The longest diameter of the community was 1.6 kilometres. Distance bands of 100metre buffer rings were constructed around the geographic mean centre to give a sense of relative accessibility or closeness to community facilities. Convex hull, which is another feature in Arch GIS 10.2 was used in calculating the minimum bounding geography of the extent of facilities within the community. For instance, with the four pharmacy shops located in the community, the convex hull represented a square covering the area covered by the pharmacies in the community. All the convex hulls were overlaid on geographic mean centre of the respondents to show the relationship between community facilities and the geographic mean centre of the respondents. Studies on health show that options available within a given location almost certainly influenc e people's choices on regular basis (French et al. 2001, Schaffer et al. 2003). The community therefore influences health seeking behaviour by providing several alternatives to biomedical management of hypertension. 10 Map 1.1 showing 100 metre buffer zones and geographic mean centre Picture 1.2 showing a convex hull of 7 herbal shops in the community 11 Picture 1.2 showing the area covered by 7 herbal shops in the community. This convex hull shows the relationship between geographic mean of the respondents and the connectivity to the mean centre. Picture 1.2 shows how closely connected the geographic mean is to the herbal convex hull. The scale also shows that the longest diameter between the herbal convex hull is just a little over half a kilometre with the mean centre almost placed in the centre of the lower end of the convex hull. This shows that within 300 metres from the mean centre respondents have access to almost all 7 herbal shops. Picture 1.3 Showing 3 convex hulls of churches, shrines and mosq ue 12 Picture 1.3 expresses overlapping convex hulls. This overlapping convex hull show the interaction of different religious spaces within the same geographic. The church convex hull is drawn from 14 churches, mosque convex hull is drawn from 7 mosques while the shrine convex hull is drawn from 27 major shrine locations within this relatively small geographic space. This map describes an intensely religious and religiously diverse group of people. The map also shows that the geographic mean located within the centre is overlapped by these religious spaces. This describes easy accessibility to these spaces. 13 Picture 1.4 Showing accessibility to all the health systems mentioned by respondents 14 Picture 1.4 describes different convex hulls and the overlay of convex hulls over the 100 metre buffer zones of the community as well as the geographic mean centre. This map shows the convex hull of churches, mosques, clinics, pharmacies, chemist shops, herbal outlets and shrines. The complexity of the picture 1.4 somewhat describes the complexity of health accessibility within the community. The different convex hulls and their overlapping maps across the geographic mean shows easy accessibility to all the different health care systems within two communities. Further, within 500metres from the geographic mean, most respondents have access to most facilities within the community. This complexity may help explain complex health seeking behaviours exhibited by people living with hypertension within the two communities. This generally suggests, that respondents have access to any type of health facility within walking distances from their homes. Furthermore, accessibility to different systems may have complex outcomes for individuals. For example, accessibility to hospitals and clinics may enhance biomedical management, while accessibility to pharmacies and chemist may reinforce healer shopping, sequential medicine use or dual use especially in a context where drug laws are not strictly enforced. Close proximity of pharmacies and chemist shops encourage easy purchasing of over the counter drugs without prescription. Access to unregulated ethno-medical and faith healing systems that are also common in the community could have potentially worse outcomes for biomedical management. Neighbourhood research from high income countries show that neighbourhood characteristics are significantly associated with individual health choices and outcomes (French et al. 2001, Schaffer et al. 2003).

Many of the respondents had only primary education and below. Respondents were aged between 30 and 75 years. Just one respondent had formal 17 employment; the majority were engaged in irregular income generating activities such as pretty trading. A few women hawked their wares in and around the study communities. Table 1.9 in the appendix provides a detailed demographic profile of the respondents. Picture 1.5 Utility of hypertension health services in the study community Figure 1.5 is a word cloud describing words that were coded for hypertension management strategies. The Nvivo 10 output of the word cloud shows the dominance of attending Ussher Poly clinic as a strategy for controlling hypertension within the community, other dominant codes included Moringa, BP monitors, Church, Cathedral Clinic and Agbeve tonic. Picture 1.6 to picture 1.9 below show tree maps created from the frequency of coded words that refer to health seeking behaviour from the interviews. 18 Picture 1.6 is a tree map showing the codes of biomedical facilities and their use Picture 1.6 is a tree map of biomedical facilities showing the dominant themes and less dominant themes across all thirty respondents. The tree map shows that Ussher Polyclinic, Cathedral Clinic, KBTU and the pharmacies were the dominant coded biomedical strategies people identified in the community. The tree map also shows Club House Clinic, Rose Clinic, Saint Theresa's Clinic, Ridge Hospital, P and T Clinic, Flora Clinic and Russia Clinic are minor coded responses in relation to hypertension health seeking behaviours. With the exception of P and T which is located in the community, all the biomedical facilities in red are located outside of the community. The use of biomedical facilities located in the community dominated health seeking behaviours amongst research participants. While the tree map shows differences in the dominance of coded biomedical strategies, the map also shows that 30 respondents together have used 14 different biomedical facilities for managing hypertension mainly within the community and a few outside community. This describes availability and use of several biomedical options by respondents. 19 Table 1.8 in the appendix shows multiple use of biomedical facilities by some respondents. Healer shopping could potentially complicate hypertension treatment even within the professional sector because health facilities may not be in position to monitor the condition over time. Picture 1.7 is a tree map showing codes for ethno-medicine Picture 1.7 describes the pattern of use of ethno-medicine amongst study participants. Sixteen different ethno-medical strategies were identified by the respondents in varying degrees of coded dominance strategies for hypertension management. Agbeve Tonic, Moringa, BP monitors and herbal products (mostly unnamed) were identified as dominant themes for hypertension management. Castor oil, Prekese, Quinine tonic, liver clinic, cocoa leaves were some of the less dominant themes mentioned as strategies for hypertension management. Table 1.8 in the appendix shows multiple use of ethno-medical strategies by some respondents. 20 Picture 1.8 is a tree map showing religious strategies mentioned by respondents in the study Picture 1.8 shows the dominance of respondents who identified prayers and church related activities as part of the measures of controlling hypertension over other religious measures of controlling hypertension like the mosque and shrines. Even though many respondents did not rely on church prayers as a sole health seeking behaviour, 12 respondents expressed faith in a Christian God's ability to ultimately he al them of hypertension. Church prayers often supplemented management from biomedical or ethno-medical sources. One man linked his hypertension to external spiritual forces, he sought treatment from church as well as from the shrine. At the time of the interview, one woman had discarded prescribed medicines and depended solely on Islamic prayers because according to her, she entertained the condition by keeping her medication box. 21 Picture 1.9 shows a tree map of codes generated from biomedicine, ethno- medicine and faith healing. A total of 115 strategies were mentioned by 30 respondents covering 36 different options for hypertension management by the research participants. Picture 1.9 shows a combination of pictures 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8 which actually represents all the coded responses as mentioned by research participants in the study. Actually health seeking behaviour of all the respondents would include biomedical strategies, ethno-medical and faith healing strategies, dominant and less dominant codes. Table 1.8 in the appendix shows respondents drew from all the different systems of health care (biomedical, ethno-medical and faith) operating within the community in managing hypertension. The structure and functions of health care were observed to be different within the same system of health care. For instance, even though pharmacies are listed as part of the biomedical system, 22 inappropriate use of the pharmacies such as purchasing drugs without proper prescription could potentially complicate the treatment and subsequent control of hypertension. Also, the study observed that within biomedical system, some of the facilities were better equipped to control hypertension than other facilities. For example, 2 out of 5 community clinics were not run by medical doctors. Similarly, the structure and functions of ethno-medical systems that provided hypertension care within the community were also organized differently. Some of the ethno - medical facilities operated like community clinics, diagnosing and treating sicknesses including hypertension. Some of the facilities comprised of table top herbal outlets where roots and tree back combinations were sold to people depending on the condition the herbalists purported to treat. Further, some churches within the community had a strong healing emphasis, while others did not. Coded responses show that respondents applied all these different systems of health care for controlling hypertension. Health Behaviours Three major pathways of hypertension management and heal th seeking behaviours were identified and classified. All respondents were subsequently classified according to these illness actions or pathways of health seeking behaviour. The first group consisted of those who adhered to biomedical management. The second group consisted of respondents who self- regulated. The last group were medically inactive, having withdrawn from diet and drug management therapies. Analysis of the qualitative interviews are presented in tables 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6. Each section is first proceeded by a thematic network showing the relationship between codes and observed behaviour. Explanation of the codes is followed by the thematic framework and extracts of codes from transcripts. 23 Biomedical Management Biomedical management played an important role in detecting and diagnosing hypertension for all respondents. Six respondents reported exclusively managing their hypertension with biomedical drugs prescribed by the doctor. They also reported visiting the hospital at regular intervals and consistently checking the blood pressure at the hospital anytime they reported at the hospital. They reported making significant changes to their lifestyle in the area of diet especially in lowering the salt content in their diets. This group made significant efforts to adhere to biomedical treatment procedures on regular basis. Out of the six who people who reported adhering, there were five women and one man. Confidence in the professional system, an acknowledgement of the superior knowledge of health professionals, successful use of the health insurance, perceived fear of the complications and severity of hypertension and family support were identified as codes that enhanced regular biomedical management. Regular exercising an important aspect of biomedical management (Buene, 2006) was distinctively absent in the strategies adopted by these respondents. Respondents noted that any attempt at exercising resulted in intense heart palpitations which discouraged them. Perhaps respondents a re not aware of the kinds of exercises that would promote optimal benefits considering their age and physical conditions. Respondents in this group mentioned cost as one of the main barriers to biomedical drug management. Three codes described cost as a barrier to biomedical management. Participants mentioned that the health insurance did not cover all their medications and had to pay for some of 24 the drugs out- of-pocket. Secondly, when drugs were covered by the health insurance, they were not always available in the designated pharmaceutical outlets that respondents could access for free. Thirdly, respondents mentioned that it was challenging to sustain hypertensive management in terms of diet and drugs indefinite Figure 1 Adherence and Non Adherence Non Adherence/Cost Adherence Indefinite management of diet and drug therapy NHIS does not cover drugs High cost of medication Confidence in doctors Family support Fear of hypertension Avoidance of complications Lack of confidence in herbal medication Successful use of NHIS 25 Table 1.2 describing adherence behaviour Theme Behaviour Definition of codes Confidence in the health system and medical personnel Lack of confidence in herbal preparations Use of NHIS Avoiding complications Adherence .......the doctor is the one who has been to school........... I am a chemical analyst......the herbalist don't know the concentration of the herbs they give people......I'll never use herbal medication ...nobody can confuse me I don't pay anything because of the health Insurance.....even though a few of the drugs are not covered......R1 .........My heart beat stops when I take my medications........ Case Study (33-year-old woman) A respondent was supposed to have exhausted her drugs a few days ago, but she hadn't because she anticipated that she could not buy more drugs once she used up the ones she was currently taking for two reasons. She uses two hypertensive drugs, one is covered by the health insurance, and the other is not. At the time of the interview, pharmacists were on strike, this meant there was no drugs available even with health insurance. Secondly, it was mid-month, her husband only gave her money for drugs at the end of the month and the other drug not covered by the insurance was almost exhausted with just about four tablets left. She therefore reserved those just in case there was a crisis which she said was frequent when she is not on drugs. I start thinking especially when I don't have enough money, especially when the BP goes very high and there is no money, who are you to ask for help? I have nobody, my dad is dead and my mom 26 does not have enough, my uncle who was once helping me too is not around, so it's my husband that helps me but he also goes to work...............R 13 Self-Regulation and Healer shopping This group is characterised by respondents who had compromised direct medical advice to hypertension management. Various strategies were used for substituting regular biomedical management. Some of these strategies mentioned were use of pain killers instead of anti- hypertensive drugs, intermittent use of herbal medication, use of lay people roaming with blood pressure monitors, use of Sodas and recycling of old prescription without medical advice. Attributions for some of these alternative approaches to regular treatment are dislike for hospital, \"feel better\" after treatment for a while, perception that biomedical drugs are poisonous, side effects of biomedical drugs, problems associated with attending hospital, high cost of treatment and problems related to the use of health insurance. Figure 2 Passive treatment of hypertension Feel better after the use of drug therapy Use of Pain Killers instead of Anti-hypertensives Use of roaming blood pressure technicians Use of Sodas Recycling of old medical prescription without medical advice Use of herbal medication 27 Use of Pain Killers Some respondents associated rising blood pressure with physical symptoms. Respondents with this perception only sought treatment when the perceived symptoms of hypertension necessitate d it. These respondents managed hypertension by treating the occurrence of symptoms. Another dimension of this perception was withdrawal from activities thought to be associated with rising blood pressure. Respondents would withdraw from physical activity they thought caused a rise in blood pressure. When I don't want to go to the hospital...I drink a lot of water and sleep afterwards...I wake up normally feeling fine .... R28 When it happens, I buy ''quick action''. As for that one when I take, the pain goes completely .....R22 Recycling medical prescription without medical advice Some respondents reused old prescriptions without medical advice. These respondents kept older prescriptions to purchase drugs over the counter from pharmacies and chemical sellers when they experienced complications they associated with hypertension. Respondents kept prescriptions to reuse any time they experienced the same symptoms for which they were given drugs by the doctor. They felt the same prescriptions would always have the same effect and did not ne ed to go to the hospitals to be given the same drugs. Respondents did not intend to maintain a regular drug management but would get drugs when they experienced any symptom. Some respondents had kept these prescriptions for years without medical consultation and advice. I used the prescription the doctor gave me to buy drugs several times and I felt at those times my condition had stabilised because the constant headache had stopped but the palpitation was still persistent ...as for the palpitation if it's not there today tomorrow it would come back ...I however 28 lost the prescription at some point and I have since not taken any medication in a long time......R 20 Alternative Biomedical services Some respondents used alternative means to check their blood pressure and receiving advice on blood pressure control. A small industry of itinerant blood pressure monitoring agents existed in the two communities. These individuals, who were not health workers or trained in BP diagnosis and control, moved from house to house with electronic blood pressure monitors checking blood pressure for some respondents and advising them for a fee. Some of these people took on the additional role of selling drugs for respondents and advising them based on their own local drug expertise. They did not have any form of license and their scope of operation remained largely unknown. The research team encountered some of these itinerant BP agents during field visits and during interview sessions as they moved into homes of respondents. They had established good relationships with many people living with hypertension in the community and had a good understanding of community dynamics. They were aware of the high prevalence of hypertension in the community and exhibited some basic knowledge concerning blood pressure management practices. They marketed their services aggressively. Their services were cheap and convenient: GH .50 to Gh 1, which is about USD0.13 to USD 0.26. Ten respondents depended on these lay people in varying degrees: some only checked their blood pressure levels, while others accessed additional hypertension services. Some respondents consistently monitored blood pressure levels and would respond to treatment based on observations from their blood pressure measurement. This arrangement worked well for individuals who only took medications when their blood pressure was rising or when they experienced symptoms they suspected as rising blood pressure. While some respondents did not 29 necessarily adhere to biomedical treatment many were aware of the fatal consequences of uncontrolled hypertension and would try to avoid using this means. Respondents would then proceed to the pharmacy shops with old prescriptions to purchase anti hypertensives to manage the complications if they were told their blood pressure was excessively high. This arrangement enabled some people with hypertension to completely avoid the hospital system for a long time and still get some kind of hypertension treatment. Use of Herbal Medication Fifteen respondents mentioned the use of herbal preparations or medications for hypertension management. Herbal medication is a complex organization within the study communities. Some herbal businesses had designated outlets for sale of standardized herbal drugs. However most of the herbal drug businesses offered unregulated drugs. Various types of herbal medications we re documented: these ranged from bottled concoctions to mixtures of herbs which the patients were directed to prepare themselves. Ten respondents used home remedies often suggested by family and friends. The Ghanaian herbal industry is very popular for sexual vitality medicines and supplements. People who live with chronic conditions like hypertension that weaken men sexually often find herbal remedies attractive as they promise to restore sexual vitality. Herbal medication is generally thought to be cheaper and perceived to have the ability to completely cure hypertension. Herbal medication has its own appeal as respondents do not have to take them indefinitely and promis es a cure which biomedicine does not. In addition, herbal medication is advertised in public spaces (on billboards) and in the mass media (radio, television, newspapers). .........A friend of mine told me to use local medicine (xxx) and after taking it for three days it will go down dramatically.......... Interviewer: But did you believe that local medicine can cure your sickness 30 Respondent: yesss local medicine can cure my BP completely ......19 Cost of treatment High cost of treatment and inability to enrol on the health insurance were mentioned as the main reasons for non-adherence to biomedicine. Many respondents did not have an active insurance and could also not pay for treatment out of pocket. When respondents did not get access to proper medical care, they managed the complication with painkillers and herbal preparations. Blood pressure medicine is very expensive....as for diabetes you can manage by lifestyle changes and you would be fine ......22 The perception that biomedical medications are poisonous Some respondents mentioned the fact that medications were poisonous and should not be taken all the time. They reasoned that by taking medications, they regularly injected consistent doses of poison into themselves. While they acknowledged the efficacy of biomedical medication to treat hypertension, they were conscious of its perceived side effects and deliberately spaced the taking of drugs to reduce the poisonous effect of blood pressure medication. Herbal preparations and medications were perceived to be natural and did not contain these poisons. Side Effects of drugs Some respondents were keenly aware of the side effects of hypertensive drugs and sometimes deliberately spaced taking medication to control its side effects. .........The use of too many medicines for medications too, has its own side effects........ R19 The use of herbal medication was prominent amongst respondents with this perception. They perceived, erroneously, that herbal medications had no side effects because they were made directly from natural products. 31 Dislike for Hospital Many respondents expressed dislike for going to the hospital for various reasons. Reasons included long waiting queues, some respondents expressed their frustration with spending the whole day at the hospital. Those who did not have hea lth insurance mentioned that hospital treatment cost so much, stating the cost of laboratory, cost of consultation and high cost of drugs. For these reasons many respondents expressed their dislike for the hospital even though private and government facilities were situated in close proximity to their residences, as demonstrated in the earlier section.

This included withdrawal from biomedical diet and drug therapy. 34 Figure 3 Medical Inaction Medical Inaction No confidence in biomedical system High cost of treatment Low scoring of hypertension on severity Poor information Prioritizing other conditions over hypertension 35 Medical Inaction This category consists of respondents who had not engaged any biomedical management for a while and were not seeking biomedical management to control their blood pressure. Codes generated for this behavioural theme included no confidence in biomedical system, low scoring of hypertension on severity scale, prioritisation of other conditions over hypertension, poor information and high cost of treatment. Low scoring of hypertension on the severity scale Some respondents mentioned that the only time they had been to the hospital for hypertension was when they were diagnosed. After running the full course of drug prescription, they had ne ver returned to the hospital for review as at the time of interview. Two respondents in this category scored hypertension very low on the severity scale. ... There are different types of hypertension, some are serious others are not, my wife has the serious type and she has to be more concerned about her treatment........I don't have that type.....R 17 I drink water, even one of my sister has BP, she sells rice at the road side and she used to check it, so when it happen so i take water, if i don't want to go to the hospital, then I lay flat on the bed more than one hour(1hr)then I sleep through that and when i wakeup then headaches is gone ummhu .....R17 No Confidence in biomedical system Three respondents expressed no confidence in the biomedical system. Some had bad experiences with hospitals and therefore did not have confidence in the ability of hospital professionals to manage their conditions. One woman explained that she was misdiagnosed with HIV/AIDS in one of the main biomedical facilities in the community, she maintained that she would never go to the hospital for any reason. 36 I would not have known that my BP had gone high, they did not tell me at both hospitals I visited, the doctor only told me I could not do the family planning and I asked him if I could take pills but he told me not to take the pills as well, he did not tell me the reason why. So it was when I got pregnant ... the doctor I was given at ridge hospital even got angry and wrote a letter to usher polyclinic and the other clinic that caters for pregnant women asking them why they did not tell a pregnant woman she has BP, so they teach her the things she should do and things she should avoid. That very day too, someone was disturbing me when I came back from the hospital, so we started having an argument which made my BP go high reaching almost 180 or 230 or so........ Prioritising other conditions over hypertension Three of the people living with other conditions in addition to hypertension, prioritised the treatment of these other conditions over the hypertension. They perceived these conditions to be more serious and more likely to cause immediate complications that necessitated attention and treatment. For example, one of these three respondents had a painful swollen right leg. The pain compelled him to seek treatment from multiple sources that included faith, herbal and biomedical sources without much consideration for hypertension. Another respondent who lived both hypertension and asthma dreaded the experience of an asthma attack and always prepared adequately to avoid crises, he paid less attention to hypertension and its consequences. Poor information Some respondents were totally misinformed about the cause, nature, severity, treatment of hypertension. Four dimensions of poor information were observed and coded. Some respondents always associated rising blood pressure with symptoms, such as intense heart palpitation, headache and dizziness. These respondents looked out for symptoms to initiate treatment of hypertension. 37 These respondents did not seek treatment as long as they did not experience any perceived symptoms of hypertension. Others associated hypertension with activities that resulted in intense heart palpitations. Respondents with this perception withdrew from these activities with the intention of controlling hypertension. Some respondents did not know that hypertension treatment was lifelong and some of those who knew did not accept this prognosis. ...... I for instance, if my BP is about to start, half of my head starts aching seriously for a month, and no amount or kind of medicine can stop the pain, until they advise and talk to me....... An important dimension of poor information is misinformation, some respondents linked blood pressure and its associated complications to external environmental or social stressors. These respondents held on to the erroneous perception that as long as they had no social stressors they did not need to commit to drug adherence. ...... The best thing to give a BP patient is a conversation that will give him or her some morals (calmness), instead of always giving medicine, because they have their side effects...... Some respondents in this group did not attempt to manage their conditions even when they experienced complications of hypertension such as headaches. Others knew of the consequences of uncontrolled hypertension and still did not commit to biomedical management. Still others demonstrated the ability to financially pay for regularly drug treatments but were not treating. It was therefore difficult to explain some of these health behaviours. Perhaps the nature of hypertension which did not present symptoms in some people may explain the no medical action in some respondents. For example, a respondent had withdrawn from regular drug management for a year even though he worked for a large pharmaceutical company and by his own account had free access to anti-hypertensives. Another woman who operated her own business purchased drugs 38 for her younger sister who also had hypertension, yet had withdrawn from biomedical treatment for a while. Religious Prayers Some respondents expressed faith in God and hope that God could and would heal their hypertension. These respondents supplemented drug therapy with daily prayers. Two respondents exclusively managed their hypertension on church and Islamic prayer. Case study A woman who depended solely on Islamic prayers had discarded the medicine box after taking the drugs, she explained that by keeping the box she was keeping the hypertension. She discarded the box with the intention of doing away with the hypertension and continued her treatment with daily prayers. She admits that ever since she came back from the hospital and exhausted the first course of drugs, she had not been to the hospital nor taken any drug.

While the qualitative component described the health behaviours of people living with hypertension, the spatial techniques gave the environmental context within which those behaviours occurred. The neighbourhood context of health behaviours have shown that neighbourhoods have a significant association with health choices and overall health outcomes. In East Harlem, diabetic research participants had a better control of their blood sugars than their participants from West Harlem because of higher accessibility to neighbourhood grocery stores which made it easy to access healthy food options (Horowitz et al. 2007). Similarly, research has shown that respondents who live in more 'favourable environments' in terms of access to physical activity spaces have better health outcomes in terms of body weight and physical activity engagement (Frank et al. 2006; Kondo et al, 2009; Rodriguez 2009). The neighbourhood characteristics of healthcare organisations therefore has implications for individual choices and subsequent health outcomes for people living with hypertension. Table 1.6 demonstrated that the dominant biomedical codes were related with health care facilities located in the community. For instance, while access to clinics may improve control in terms of appropriate biomedical treatment, access to chemists and pharmacies may have a more complicated outcome for respondents. In a context where drug laws are not strictly enforced, accessibility to pharmacies and chemist shops means access to drugs without prescription. By Law (Health Professionals Act 857), chemical shops are not allowed to sell antihypertensive drugs in the country. However, in our study context two of three chemist shops openly sold antihypertensive dugs. Some respondents got around the formal hospital system by regularly maintaining their health on medicines 41 purchased over the counter. While pharmacists insisted they only sold antihypertensive drug s with prescription, some respondents kept outdated prescriptions for regularly purchasing drugs when they experienced symptoms they thought were indications of rising blood pressure. The ease a nd accessibility of drugs from poorly regulated chemist and pharmacies shops enforced treatment and care of hypertension within the popular sector. Picture 1.4 demonstrated a wide array of different sources of healthcare available within short walking distances of respondents. The ease and convenience of plural sources of healthcare explained healer shopping widely observed amongst some respondents. Similar to de-Graft Aikins illness action theory (2007), health behaviours identified for hypertension control in this study included biomedical management, Cure seeking, faith healing and medical inaction. Confidence in the biomedical system over other systems of health care enhanced biomedical management. Unlike the Illness action theory (de-Graft Aikins, 2003), spiritual action constituted a minor causal attribution of hypertension. While many respondents expressed faith in God's ability to heal them of hypertension, just 2 respondents solely relied on faith for controlling hypertension. Faith healing alone as a means of controlling hypertension was therefore classified as medical inaction. Medical inaction was an important health behaviour observed amongst study participants. Perhaps because of the silent nature of hypertension, medical inaction was an important health behaviour observed amongst study participant s. Three major pathways of health seeking behaviour were identified: Biomedical action, self-regulation and medical inaction. These complex health seeking behaviours emphasise the point that accessibility to biomedical facilities alone may not necessarily explain the poor hypertension control. Accessibility to biomedical factors would have to be complimented with accessibility to other systems of health 42 care within defined geographic proximities of respondents. This is because respondents do not only use biomedical facilities. This may explain why most hypertension control interventions have had only short term improvements in blood pressure control (Bosu, 2014, Kayima et al. 2013). This is because most intervention strategies are only biomedical in their approach and do not attempt to explore what is within the neighbourhood of respondents and how they may have implications for hypertension control of study participants in the long term. 43 REFERENCES Addo J, Smeeth L, Leon DA. 2007.
