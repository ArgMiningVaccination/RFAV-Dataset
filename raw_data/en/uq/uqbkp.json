Methods/Results: Body and ear acupuncture was used both as supporting and integrative therapy to reduce the phases of restlessness and screaming and, simultaneously, the use of hypnotic drugs, as well as to improve the baby's thriving. Conclusions: Our case has proved that standardised ear and body acupuncture applied by trained acupuncturist paediatricians is a helpful non-pharmacological treatment tool. While acupuncture is typically used in the outpatient setting, it can equally be used in the inpatient setting, as exemplified by the positive outcome of the presented case.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2018-06-13", "cleaned_text": "Use of Acupuncture in an Infant with Restlessness and Agitation Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been reported as one of the most popular complementary treatments in children and neonates [ [3](#B3-medicines-05-00055), [4](#B4-medicines-05-00055)]. TCM includes (i) massage therapy (Tuina); (ii) moxibustion; and (iii) different kinds of acupressure and acupuncture [ [5](#B5-medicines-05-00055), [6](#B6-medicines-05-00055)]. The most common complementary applications for acupuncture include pain [ [7](#B7-medicines-05-00055), [8](#B8-medicines-05-00055)] and chemotherapy-induced nausea/vomiting [ [9](#B9-medicines-05-00055)]. To this day, only a few studies have investigated the effect of needle acupuncture in infants [ [10](#B10-medicines-05-00055), [11](#B11-medicines-05-00055), [12](#B12-medicines-05-00055), [13](#B13-medicines-05-00055)]. Even this limited available data suggests that acupuncture may be applied as a safe, non-pharmacological treatment option for the reduction of pain and agitation in term and preterm infants [ [14](#B14-medicines-05-00055), [15](#B15-medicines-05-00055), [16](#B16-medicines-05-00055)]. 2. Case Report Acupuncture Therapy [Figure 1](#medicines-05-00055-f001)) Strikingly, both the frequency and duration of the infant's screaming attacks and restlessness decreased after only one acupuncture treatment. The patient was found to be calmer, his handling was now easier and his body tension was found to be significantly reduced. All this was reported back to us by the nursing staff. As a result, the sedative medication dose was able to be reduced on a daily basis. After one week of acupuncture treatment, Clonidine and Midazolam were discontinued, and the patient was now able to drink infant formula via bottle feeding. 3. Methods [17](#B17-medicines-05-00055)]. The treatment itself is described according to the current Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) guidelines [ [18](#B18-medicines-05-00055), [19](#B19-medicines-05-00055)]. [20](#B20-medicines-05-00055)] located in the midpoint between the eyebrows was chosen due to its sedative and analgesic effects, in addition to its anxiolytic were demonstrated by Capone et al. after transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation at an external acoustic meatus that produces an increased cortical inhibitory modulation of the [14](#B14-medicines-05-00055), [32](#B32-medicines-05-00055)]. [33](#B33-medicines-05-00055)]. [34](#B34-medicines-05-00055)]. [14](#B14-medicines-05-00055)]. In addition, it was revealed in a clinical study carried out by Tugcu et al. that SaO2 values increased and the pulse rate decreased significantly in infants on whom acupressure on Yin Tang had previously been applied [ [21](#B21-medicines-05-00055)]. Other studies specifically address the effect of acupuncture interventions on withdrawal and agitation in children. Wang et al. found that acupressure on Yin Tang reduced anxiety in children undergoing anaesthesia [ [20](#B20-medicines-05-00055)]. Due to these facts, we have meanwhile included this acupoint in our overall therapy concept. In the patient under discussion here, the heart rate remained low throughout the various acupuncture sessions. [35](#B35-medicines-05-00055), [36](#B36-medicines-05-00055)]. [12](#B12-medicines-05-00055)]. Similar results have been reported by Lindgren et al. in newborns with infantile colic receiving acupuncture on LI4, who had shorter periods of crying due to better relaxation [ [11](#B11-medicines-05-00055)]. We ourselves have reported about an improved feeding behaviour. Another study by Usichenko et al. has shown that stimulation of LI4 in children reduces pain and autonomic distress [ [25](#B25-medicines-05-00055)]. [37](#B37-medicines-05-00055)]. [9](#B9-medicines-05-00055)]. [23](#B23-medicines-05-00055)], potentially modifies dysfunction by increasing parasympathetic activity and reduces sympathetic hyperactivity [ [38](#B38-medicines-05-00055), [39](#B39-medicines-05-00055)]. [23](#B23-medicines-05-00055)]. [40](#B40-medicines-05-00055)]. It has also been shown that the combination of ear and body acupuncture is very successful [ [41](#B41-medicines-05-00055)]. In a study carried out in neonates with NAS, the addition of auricular acupressure beads did not result in a different clinical course, though there was a suggestive trend towards less pharmacological support needed in the acupressure group [ [42](#B42-medicines-05-00055)]. In their publications, Gentry et al. and Raith et al. have repeatedly described the positive effects on improved sleeping behaviour due to a better relaxation in NAS-treated newborns [ [8](#B8-medicines-05-00055), [43](#B43-medicines-05-00055)]. In the case of the infant presented here, we observed a successful decrease in the use of pharmacological medication for sedation with the improvement of the baby's behaviour through doing Shen Men as part of the NADA protocol. [44](#B44-medicines-05-00055)] have reviewed 18 databases, resulting in 37 reports. Of the adverse events reported, the majority were mild in nature, including bruising, and pain. In addition, systematic reviews of acupuncture for children and newborns have found that acupuncture is in fact a safe treatment when performed by trained and licensed acupuncturists [ [15](#B15-medicines-05-00055), [44](#B44-medicines-05-00055)]. [Figure 2](#medicines-05-00055-f002)). ST36, drug-therapy was reduced contentiously, bottle feeding established quickly and the nurses' protocol described a more relaxed baby after the acupuncture treatment. 5.
