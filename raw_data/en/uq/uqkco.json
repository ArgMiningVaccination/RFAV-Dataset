One friend is currently a Clinical Pharmacy Specialist and the other has recently practiced in a community pharmacy and is now homeschooling her children. Their perspectives as Pharmacists and Christian moms have been a gift to me and I know they will be to you too. We talk about vaccine myths and misinformation, the efficacy and quality of the vaccines, misconceptions after getting vaccinated, and the moral and Biblical perspective on the vaccines. We cover so much, including\u2014but not limited to\u2014the following: the vaccines will actually give you Covid-19, cause infertility, or were developed too quickly to be safe; MRNA technology, microchips, and issues related to breastfeeding and pregnancy; long-term effects of the vaccines, issues for those with auto-immune disease, aborted fetal cells, blood clotting and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine pause; whether or not you need the vaccine if you've already been infected and other issues related to exposure and transmission after getting vaccinated; research showing that white Evangelicals are the least likely religious group to get the vaccine, and finally our agreed upon conclusion that getting the vaccine is an important way to love God and love neighbor in this historical moment.
