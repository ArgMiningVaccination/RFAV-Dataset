Live Healthy South Carolina aims to help communities build health through the policy, systems and environments they create. The Alliance for a Healthier South Carolina serves as the backbone organization for this collaborative effort. It seeks to use data to guide action and bring partners together to align and focus efforts to better our health. 8 LIVE HEALTHY SOUTH CAROLINA State Health Improvement Plan The 2018-2023 South Carolina State Health Improvement Plan (SHIP) provides a vision for continuous health improvement. It outlines priority areas and includes strategies to improve the health of all people in South Carolina. It is a tool for health care professionals, government agencies, community-based organizations, advocates, academicians, policy makers, and other stakeholders to use to catalyze action that will leverage resources and focus work towards measurable improvement. The SHIP's success depends on the contribution of many organizations essential to ensuring all South Carolinians reach their optimal health. Putting this plan into action can bring us together to achieve outcomes desired by organizations across multiple sectors. Priorities in the SHIP were chosen based on data described in the State Health Assessment (SHA). The SHA is a compilation of trends and comparisons from many sources that together paint a picture of South Carolina's health. Metrics were identified so that an annual analysis of health improvement can be completed and shared.9 STATE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLANThe SHIP builds on the work of many coalitions and organizations across South Carolina. The collaborative health improvement model outlined in the SHIP accomplishes the following goals: Provide a review of strategies that canimprove population health Create a focus on improving everyone'shealth Align state-level leaders from many sectors Call to action for state and communities ACEs Alliance CHA CHIP SC RHAP SCORH SHA SHIPSWOTAdverse Childhood ExperiencesAlliance for a Healthier South Carolina Community Health Assessment Community Health Improvement PlanSouth Carolina Rural Health Action Plan South Carolina Office of Rural Health State Health Assessment State Health Improvement Plan Strategic assessment of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threatsCommon Acronyms State Health Assessment State Health Improvement PlanEngaging Partners Leveraging Data PointsJUNE Establishing Partners Developing andSummarizing Plan Finalizing Plan Communicating andImplementing PlanJANUARY APRIL OCTOBER JANUARY Celebrating WorkOCTOBEROCTOBER2017 2018 2018State Health Assessment State Health Improvement PlanEngaging Partners Leveraging Data PointsJUNE Establishing Partners Developing andSummarizing Plan Finalizing Plan Communicating andImplementing PlanJANUARY APRIL OCTOBER JANUARY Celebrating WorkOCTOBEROCTOBER2017 2018 2019 LIVE HEALTHY SOUTH CAROLINA 1011 STATE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLANLive Healthy South Carolina's process includes steps from the initiation of the State Health Assessment (SHA) to annual review of the State Health Improvement Plan (SHIP) metrics (timeline shown on page 10). The framework was modified from the Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships model that was developed by the National Association of City and County Health Officials. An activity called \"Decision Walk Using Data\" was used to present data from the South Carolina Office of Rural Health's Rural Health Action Plan and the SHA to inform, educate, and engage stakeholders in a robust discussion about health outcomes in South Carolina. This was conducted three times between October 2017 and January 2018. The Alliance for a Healthier South Carolina (Alliance) and other community organizations participated. Additionally, in January 2018, a modified SWOT analysis called \"Forces of Change\" was conducted by the Alliance members to identify issues affecting the state's health. Members of the Alliance based their selection of priorities for the SHIP on their review of the SHA findings, the Decision Walk Using Data activity, and the Forces of Change discussion. The group utilized the Hanlon method to vote on priorities and narrowed the results to five priority areas:1.Resilient Children (AdverseChildhood Experiences, Trauma andResilience) 2.Chronic Health Conditions (Obesity,Hypertension, Heart Disease, Strokeand Diabetes) 3.Behavioral Health (Mental Health andSubstance Use Disorders) 4.Health Care Transformation (Accessto Care, Workforce and IntegratedHealth Care) 5.Factors that Affect Health (SocialDeterminants of Health and HealthDisparities) Workgroups were formed to develop goals, strategies and metrics for the SHIP . They included Alliance members, subject matter experts, and members of other coalitions already working on the priority areas. Coalitions comprised of many organizations are in place to focus attention and work on the priority areas. A compendium of assets in South Carolina that support population health improvement was compiled and is included in a later chapter. 13 RESILIENT CHILDRENPRIORITY 11 AIM: Build resilience in South Carolina's children through safe and supportive environments.14 LIVE HEALTHY SOUTH CAROLINA BRIGHT SPOT Children's resilience is heavily influenced by the capacity of the adults in their lives to buffer exposure to stress and provide responsive, sensitive care, especially in the first five years of life. Taking care of children means taking care of their caregivers. Be Well Care Well does just that. The work of Be Well Care Well to support the well-being of childcare providers not only has positive implications for the individual health and well-being of the staff members, it also impacts the emotional health of the children in their care. Early care and education providers may themselves experience economic hardship, low social status, demanding work environments, and other chronic stressors.1 Childcare teachers who experience high levels of stress, depression, and anxiety may be less likely to have positive, supportive interactions with children and may be more likely to expel a child from a preschool program.2 A child's early experiences influence their health later in life in profound ways. Childcare providers have a tremendous impact on a child's social-emotional health and development. Taking care of children requires taking care of their teachers. The Be Well Care Well program supports child care providers across eight dimensions of wellness: emotional, environmental, financial, intellectual, occupational, physical, social and spiritual. \"Thanks to Be Well Care Well, I have carved out time every day when I have an assistant with the children, so I can work on self- care,\" says Rhonda Johnson, of Johnson Creative Playroom. \"I have taken advantage of the community partner connections by taking SC Thrive trainings and Cooking Matters, going for a mammogram, and participating in the Women's Health Walk with a Doc. I also chose a primary care doctor, which is something I haven't done in over 10 years!\"15 STATE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN Be Well Care Well currently serves the Midlands, Pee Dee and Lowcountry regions. A Well-Being Coach is assigned to each participating childcare program, providing on-site assistance and connection to resources. Programs form a Well-Being Committee. Together, the committee and coach use the Well- Being Activity Guide to select goals that address staff priorities. It includes a number of activities, including on-site exercise and nutrition classes, on-site health screenings, stress management and self-care workshops, and access to employee assistance programs. Four Well-Being Packages are also available, for example, exercise supplies for staff to use at work. The coaches assist participants in meeting their goals by planning activities, identifying and customizing resources, and coordinating services with local and state partners like SC Thrive. Achieving their goals improves self-care and support among the staff. In turn, these childcare teachers are better positioned to provide care that is responsive and sensitive to children.RESILIENT CHILDREN Thanks to Be Well Care Well, I have carved out time every day when I have an assistant with the children, so I can work on self-care.

Resilience is the ability for children to show healthy development despite experiencing adversity. Building resilience requires building the child's inner resources as well strengthening the family and the community. When children's basic needs including ample, healthy food, stable housing, and safety are not met, they experience emotional distress. Children who do not have emotional support and who do not succeed in school have greater risks of poor health outcomes in childhood and later in life. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are defined as emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, physical or emotional neglect, and household dysfunction, which includes living with someone with a mental health disorder or substance use disorder, living with someone who was incarcerated, being exposed to domestic violence, or having your parents separate or divorce. ACEs have been linked to risky health behaviors, chronic health conditions and early death. Severe childhood trauma and hardships may also contribute to behavioral health problems in adulthood. Long-term harms of childhood adversity can extend across generations. Children of parents who had four or more adverse childhood experiences are at double the risk of having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and are four times more likely to have behavioral health problems. When children grow up in healthy, nurturing homes and environments, they have a better chance of becoming healthy adults. Healthy, productive adults go on to build healthier, safer families and communities for their children. Families who live in under- resourced communities face greater obstacles to building resilience in their children and supporting positive transitions from childhood to adulthood. RESILIENT CHILDREN17 STATE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN PROTECTIVE FACTORS Protective factors are conditions or attributes of individuals, families, communities, or the larger society that mitigate risk and promote healthy development and well-being. Examples include: Social emotional competence of childrenConcrete support in times of needSupportive social connectionsParental ResilienceKnowledge of parenting and child developmentACEs and childhood emotional distress can be prevented and their effects can be mitigated. Intervening early in life can change a child's life course. South Carolina is working to improve the social and emotional health of children and their families through changes at the system and community levels. Health care systems and schools often serve as a portal of entry for traumatized individuals and have a unique opportunity to work with community partners to build childhood resilience. Having a mechanism to regularly bring together organizations that serve children provides a basis for building systems of care, improving coordination among agencies, identifying gaps and monitoring outcomes of South Carolina's children. This can assist organizations in designing specific, targeted programs that prevent disease and promote optimal health and development.

About the same percent of males and females reported emotional/ physical abuse as children (38.7%, 38.8%); 8.3% of males and 16.7% of females reported childhood sexual abuse. In all three categories of ACEs, household dysfunction, emotional/physical abuse, and sexual abuse, a greater percent of disabled adults reported ACEs than non- disabled adults (56.4% versus 48.1%; 44.5% versus 35.6%; 17.6% versus 9.9% in consecutive order). A greater percent of Black adults reported household dysfunction ACEs than White adults (57.9% versus 48.6%). In 2016, the rate of nonfatal child maltreatment in South Carolina was 15.8 per 1,000 children. The rate was highest among infants and then decreased by increasing age group: 39.6 in infants less than one year; 19.6 in one to four year olds, 16.7 in five to nine year olds, 11.5 in 10 to 14 year olds, and 6.9 in 15 to 17 year olds.GOALS, STRATEGIES AND BEST PRACTICES GOAL 1: Coordinate across organizations to build an integrated early childhood data system.

Then a pharmacist decided to act. Donna Avant became the only health professional in town when she opened Ehrhardt Pharmacy in Bamberg County. She quickly saw the need in her community and went well beyond filling prescriptions. Diabetes is a serious health issue in the county, with many residents experiencing risk factors for the disease. According to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's County Health Rankings, 41% of adults in Bamberg County are obese, while only 33% are physically active. A proven program to help people manage their disease is the National Diabetes Prevention Program, a year-long lifestyle change intervention. Avant was determined to provide this opportunity to her community. Funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) allowed her to access training and materials to successfully implement the program. Ehrhardt Pharmacy has now trained six cohorts and plans to continue the program. Avant says, \"My biggest wish, more than anything, is to get people more excited to change their lives and care for themselves.\"My biggest wish, more than anything, is to get people more excited to change their lives and care for themselves.

In 2016, the Department of Defense reported a dramatic increase in troops being overweight, up from one in 60 troops in 2001 to one in 13. Obesity is one of the most pressing health problems facing our state. It can lead to high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, some cancers, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis, gout, and sleep apnea. In addition to personal decisions and genetics, a number of factors contribute to obesity. Access to affordable, healthy food, education and safe places to exercise are necessary to make healthy choices. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of technology and marketing of unhealthy food impede healthy decision making. Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body stops making or doesn't use insulin well, causing sugars to build up in the blood. It is affecting Americans at increasingly younger ages as obesity rates have climbed. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, blindness, and non-traumatic lower- extremity amputations among adults ages 20 to 74. According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the total estimated cost of diagnosed diabetes in 2017 was $327 billion, including $237 billion in direct medical costs and $90 billion in reduced productivity. The ADA's study, Economic Costs of Diabetes in the United States in 2017, found that 66% of the cost is provided by government insurance (including Medicare, Medicaid, and the military). High blood pressure can harden the arteries in the body, which decreases the flow of blood and oxygen to the heart. It leads to heart attacks, heart failure, stroke and chronic kidney disease. Most people do not have symptoms associated with high blood pressure so regular screening is key. It can be controlled through medication, a low-salt diet, daily physical activity, and not smoking. Tobacco use increases the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke. Heart disease 30 LIVE HEALTHY SOUTH CAROLINA includes several types of heart conditions, but the most common is coronary artery disease. It leads to decreased blood flow and that can cause a heart attack. A stroke occurs when a clot blocks the blood supply to the brain or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts. Maintaining a healthy weight by consuming the right number of calories, being active at least 30 minutes every day, avoiding tobacco, and not drinking alcohol excessively are key to preventing obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke. Developing policies and creating environments that make healthy choices easier and less expensive support South Carolinians in preventing these costly chronic health conditions. South Carolina has strong multi-sector collaborations focused on long-term change and health improvement. However, there is a need to build diverse partnerships that will allow us to broaden our capacity and align resources to better impact outcomes. Over the next five years we will work to create a structured process to ensure cross-sector representation and formal linkages that are inclusive of state and community coalitions and key stakeholders. DATA The prevalence of obesity among adults in South Carolina was 33.2% in 2016. It was higher among adults with an annual household income less than $15,000 (40.8%) than among those with income $50,000 and higher (28.4%).CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS Thirteen percent of South Carolina adults had diabetes in 2016 and was higher in those with an annual household income of less than $25,000 than those with an annual household income of $50,000 or more. In 2016, more than one-third (39.3%) of adults in South Carolina had hypertension. The prevalence was higher in Black residents (45.2%) than White residents (38.1%). It was also higher in those with an annual household income less than $15,000 (50.5%) than in those with income of $50,000 or more (32.7%).The prevalence of age- adjusted adult obesity increased from 31.6% in 2011 to 33.2% in 201631 STATE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN From 2007 to 2016, there was a 23% decrease in coronary heart disease death in South Carolina (112.1 per 100,000 in 2007 to 86.4 in 2016), and the rate was lower than the United States rate (94.3). South Carolina's stroke death rate also decreased from 53.3 per 100,000 to 45.5. The prevalence of adults in South Carolina who met physical activity guidelines for both aerobic and muscle training increased from 18.9% in 2011 to 23.0% in 2016. In 2015, 23.6% of South Carolina high school students met the federal physical activity guidelines for aerobic physical activity.less than $50,000 compared to those with income of $50,000 or more. The percent of South Carolina high school students who smoke decreased from 17.8% in 2007 to 9.6% in 2015. In South Carolina in 2015, 22.4% of adults reported being exposed to secondhand smoke while at the workplace. ECONOMIC IMPACT Obesity-related health spending in South Carolina is estimated to be $8.6 billion per year and growing. If South Carolina could halt the increase in the prevalence of diabetes at today's levels, we could save $818 per adult, or $3 billion annually.3 Cigarette smoking increases annual health care spending in South Carolina by $1.9 billion per year.4The prevalence of current cigarette use among adults decreased. A decrease was seen in cigarette use among high school youth from 16.0% in 2013 to 9.6% in 2015 From 2011 to 2016, there was a decrease in the percent of adult smokers in South Carolina from 23.7% to 20.6%.

Certified Peer Support Recovery Specialists work with inmates, correctional staff, stakeholders, families, and providers in a holistic approach for community reintegration. More than 50 percent of Americans who suffer from an opioid use disorder have also had contact with the criminal justice system, according to a study published in the JAMA Network Open (2018).5 \"Many crimes that don't appear to be drug related actually are,\" says Michael Crawford, a Certified Peer Support Specialist working at SCDC. Crawford adds that this can often be true for financial crimes such as burglary. Peer Support Recovery Specialists are in long-term recovery themselves from substance use and/or a mental health illness. They use their lived experiences to encourage, empower, and educate others. In addition to helping participants develop and maintain a recovery plan, they provide a supportive relationship and teach a variety of life skills, including obtaining safe housing, improving job skills, and finding new leisure activities. Crawford says he works with the program to use his own difficult experiences for something positive. He works in seven different prisons. Crawford says, \"I can see a difference in people when I BEHAVIORAL HEALTH I can see a difference in people when I introduce myself by saying, 'I am in active recovery. I know what it is like to feel the way you do.' People open up when they realize I am not there to judge them. Michael Crawford Peer Support Specialist, DAODAS\" 43 STATE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN introduce myself by saying, 'I am in active recovery. I know what it is like to feel the way you do.' People open up when they realize I am not there to judge them.\" Research has shown that peer support facilitates recovery and reduces health care costs. The National Institute on Drug Abuse says that conservative estimates show that every dollar invested in addiction treatment programs yields a return of between $4 and $7 in reduced drug-related crime, criminal justice costs and theft.6 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH Behavioral health is the state of successful mental function allowing you to engage in productive activities and fulfilling relationships and the ability to adapt to change or cope with challenges. Behavioral health is essential to personal well-being, family and interpersonal relationships and the ability to contribute to one's community and society as a whole. Behavioral health disorders include both mental health and substance use disorders. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), behavioral health disorders are among the most common causes of disability. The financial and human costs are enormous. Related health care costs alone are $57 billion per year in the United States, about the same as cancer related treatment. Individuals living with a behavioral health disorder may struggle to care for themselves or members of their family, complete daily activities, secure employment and manage relationships. Behavioral health and substance use disorders are impacted by broad and multifaceted issues that vary over the stages of life. Risk factors for chronic medical conditions such as tobacco use, poor nutrition and sedentary lifestyles are more prevalent among people with a behavioral health illness as are the social conditions that often lead to poor health, such as homelessness and poverty. Drug and alcohol use can also lead to other chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. SAMHSA reports that people with a mental health issue are more likely to use alcohol or drugs than those not affected by a mental illness. The fragmented behavioral health care system contributes to the challenges people face in managing behavioral health conditions. Screening, early 44 LIVE HEALTHY SOUTH CAROLINA intervention, primary care, medication management, crisis stabilization, recovery support and social supports reduce poor health outcomes. Delivering appropriate care and treatment to individuals and providing formal discharge planning in detention centers and prisons can also reduce recidivism. South Carolina is working across organizations and sectors to reduce the stigma of mental illness and substance use disorders and improve coordination and awareness of, services, and resources for individuals and families. DATA In 2014-15, 4.1% of South Carolina adults were diagnosed with a serious mental illness. The prevalence of depression in South Carolina adults increased from 15.3% in 2011 to 20.5% in 2016. It was higher in White than Black residents (23.1% versus 15.3%) and higher among females than males (26.5% versus 14.0%). In South Carolina, 11.0% of adolescents aged 12-17 in 2014-2015 experienced a major depressive episode in the preceding year, a lower percent than the United States overall (11.9%).BEHAVIORAL HEALTH The percent of adolescents who reported a major depressive episode increased from 8.1% between 2010-2011 to 11.0% between 2015-2016 The age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths in S.C. has increased 2012: 12.2 per 100,000 population 2016: 18.0 per 100,000 population45 STATE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN In 2016, 6.8% of South Carolina adults reported heavy drinking (for men, 15 or more drinks per week, and for women, eight or more drinks per week). Heavy drinking was more common among White residents and males. In South Carolina, the rate of drug overdose deaths increased nearly 50% between 2007 and 2016, from 12.2 deaths per 100,000 to 18.0. White males and 35 to 54 year olds had the highest rates. ECONOMIC IMPACT The Institute of Medicine and National Research Council's Preventing Mental, Emotional, and Behavioral Disorders among Young People Report - 2009 stated that cost-benefit ratios for early treatment and prevention programs for addiction and mental illness range from 1:2 to 1:10. According to SAMHSA, this translates to a $1 investment yielding $2 to $10 savings in health costs, criminal and juvenile justice costs, educational costs and lost productivity.7The South Carolina Department of Mental Health partnered with 24 community hospital emergency departments to offer a telepsychiatry program. In 2017, approximately 450 comprehensive evaluations were completed each month, with a cost savings of $2,300 per ED visit, for a total savings of approximately $12,420,000.8 46 LIVE HEALTHY SOUTH CAROLINA GOALS, STRATEGIES AND BEST PRACTICESGOAL 1: Ensure clinical behavioral health services are accessible to all South Carolinians.

COALITION RESPONSE Behavioral Health Coalition https://www. scha.org/members/member-initiatives/ behavioral-health-coalition The South Carolina Behavioral Health Coalition is an alliance of public and private agencies, organizations and health care providers collectively committed to improving the mental health and well- being of everyone in our state. This multi- sector coalition is an important outgrowth of the valuable work of the South Carolina Institute of Medicine and Public Health's Behavioral Health Task Force and the South Carolina House of Representatives Opioid Abuse Prevention and Study Committee that each provided a set of recommended actions to improve the care and outcomes of South Carolinians suffering with mental illness and/or substance use disorders. 51 STATE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLANSouth Carolina Rural Health Action Plan PRIORITY 4 - HEALTH CARE TRANSFORMATION PRIORITY 5 - FACTORS THAT AFFECT HEALTH54 AIM: Address factors outside of health care that affect health, and look through a consumer viewpoint to link primary care, behavioral health, oral health and supports/resources.52 LIVE HEALTHY SOUTH CAROLINA BRIGHT SPOT Hospital systems continue to embrace the need to think about how factors outside of health care affect the health of their patients and to think more holistically about the people they serve. The Northside neighborhood of Spartanburg lies just west of Spartanburg Regional Medical Center (SRMC), located in the bustling urban center of town. The Northside community has suffered since the 1990s when the local textile mill closed, resulting in many abandoned and vacant properties and high unemployment (50%). In recent years, Northside Development Group (NDG), a non-profit collaborative, has made great strides in revitalizing the area. They purchased many of the vacant lots, built new schools, created community gardens and walkways, supported affordable and market-rate housing, and facilitated other infrastructure improvements. It's not until we start sitting down and working across boundaries to see how we as a community can do better that you start seeing the possibilities of how we can share resources. Renee Romberger, Former Vice President of Community Health Policy and Strategy, Spartanburg Regional Medical Center.\" HEALTH CARE TRANSFORMATION53 STATE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN Through community \"charrettes\" with residents, NDG and SRMC learned that many residents would like to work at SRMC but experienced barriers that prohibited them from applying for jobs. In response, SRMC worked with NDG to streamline the application process for these residents, dedicating an HR representative to work with the NDG community case worker to aid in the process. Job fairs were held locally and interviews were guaranteed to all those meeting minimum criteria. An apprenticeship program was implemented through the collaboration to train people for construction jobs going on in Northside. SRMC even waived a hospital policy to allow residents previously convicted of a crime to compete for jobs, a humane move for a community so long mired in poverty.This apprenticeship program changed my entire life. Stephen Hill, Graduate of the construction apprenticeship program created by the Northside Development Group and the Spartanburg Regional Medical Center.\" FACTORS THAT AFFECT HEALTH54 LIVE HEALTHY SOUTH CAROLINA HEALTH CARE TRANSFORMATION AND FACTORS THAT AFFECT HEALTH Health is determined by more than what happens at the doctor's office or hospital. A range of personal, social, economic and environmental factors influence health status. Also called \"determinants of health\", they include policies, social factors, health services, individual behaviors and genetics. Social determinants of health include social factors and physical conditions of the environment in which people are born, live, learn, play, work and age. Studies have shown that on a population level, environmental factors account for about 10% of health, medical care for 20%, health behaviors for 30% and social and economic factors for 40%. In 2017, the South Carolina Office of Rural Health created the South Carolina Rural Health Action. It seeks to leverage interest and provide direction to partners, stakeholders, friends and neighbors from across the state to link efforts and make viable connections to address the social determinants of health. Because of the significant role these factors play on the state's health outcomes, it serves as the foundation for South Carolina's State Health Improvement Plan. 10% Environmental Factors 20% Medical 30% Health BehaviorsState Health Improvement Plan Rural Health Action Plan40% Social and Economics Factors 10% Environmental Factors 20% Medical 30% Health BehaviorsState Health Improvement Plan Rural Health Action Plan40% Social and Economics FactorsHEALTH CARE TRANSFORMATION55 STATE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN As an illustration, consider this story about two men who have similar experiences but very different outcomes. David lives in Columbia's Heathwood neighborhood. He has been employed by the same company for 12 years. Through his job, he has health insurance, 15 days of sick leave, 15 days of vacation, disability insurance, and a 401-K. He pays for car insurance. One day while driving home from work, David gets in a car wreck. His injuries require him to undergo surgery and stay in the hospital for several nights. He misses work for three weeks. David's insurance covers most of the hospital charges, and he receives his full pay while away from his job. His car insurance covers the cost of his car repairs. David takes time for a complete recovery before returning to work to avoid future complications. Adam lives in Columbia's Celia Saxon neighborhood. He works three part- time jobs, as a waiter, substitute teacher and youth football coach. He has no health benefits from any of his jobs. He pays for health insurance out of pocket and pays for car insurance. To afford his premiums, he has high deductible insurance plans. On the way home from a full-time job interview, Adam is injured in a car accident. EMS takes him to the nearest emergency department where he receives stitches. Though surgery is recommended, he can't afford the deductible, so opts out. While recovering, he works two of his jobs to pay his ED bill. He could not afford the deductible to get his car fixed. He now has daily pain due to his injury. FACTORS THAT AFFECT HEALTH56 LIVE HEALTHY SOUTH CAROLINA Though stressful, David's accident had no ongoing effects on his life. In contrast, Adam's life was seriously disrupted. There are factors outside of health care that put people at risk for poor health outcomes and others that protect them. When looking at health outcomes of populations, cumulative effects of these factors cluster geographically at the neighborhood level. For example, if a community has full-day pre-school programs and high performing schools, students are buoyed by their education. That gives them a better opportunity to get a full-time job with health insurance and other benefits. If housing is well constructed and buildings are smoke- free, asthma and other health conditions are prevented or easier to manage. If there are street lights and sidewalks, it is safer to walk to get exercise. If grocery stores or community gardens are close by, people can access healthier foods that contain fewer calories. Access to affordable, safe and healthy housing is crucial for supporting people's health. Poor housing conditions are associated with infectious diseases, chronic conditions, injuries, poor child development and behavioral health issues. Children living in substandard housing are more likely to develop serious illnesses like asthma and lead poisoning, negatively affecting their educational achievement. Low-income families are often limited to poor quality housing frequently in need of extensive repair or improvements. Rural communities have more limited access to credit than urban areas. The lack of access to mortgage credit limits options for good-quality housing. The American Association of Retired Persons defines livable communities as safe and secure, with affordable, appropriate housing and transportation options, and supportive community features and services. Livable communities are developed through specific land-use planning and design. Access to comprehensive, quality health care is important for promoting and maintaining health, preventing and managing disease, and reducing disability and premature death. Strategies addressing racial, ethnic, and underserved populations are needed to optimally improve health and health care outcomes. All South Carolinians need HEALTH CARE TRANSFORMATION57 STATE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN access to the health care system, need to understand how to access a location where needed health care services are provided (geographic or via telehealth), and need the knowledge to make informed health care decisions. Insurance coverage is a primary factor for having access to care. Adults who lack health insurance have less access to clinical care and preventive services. Health homes also play an important role in protecting the health and safety of the communities they serve. Primary care providers develop meaningful and sustainable relationships with patients and provide integrated services while practicing in the context of family and the community. Innovative strategies are needed to accelerate and reinforce the health care \"triple aim\", which is improving the experience of care, improving the health of populations, and reducing per capita costs of health care. The health care system in the United States is undergoing a transformation to meet the triple aim and become more sustainable, with a focus on health outcomes, also called \"value-based\". This includes initiatives that prevent disease at the earliest stage possible and provide care coordination to individuals with chronic conditions (both physical and behavioral). It is also consists of reducing the significant health consequences and excessive health care utilization and developing payment strategies that reward health providers and systems for achieving population health improvement. ECONOMIC IMPACT South Carolina State Housing Finance & Development Authority (SC Housing) helped more than 26,000 families realize quality, affordable housing, supported 5,336 jobs and contributed $53.6 million in state and local tax revenue. Every $100 in direct spending from affordable housing initiatives resulted in an overall total economic impact of $177 on South Carolina's economy. SC Housing directly invested more than $447.8 million in South Carolina, which resulted in the total economic impact of more than $793 million.9 FACTORS THAT AFFECT HEALTH58 LIVE HEALTHY SOUTH CAROLINA RURAL HEALTH ACTION PLAN Recommendations Access to Health Care Ensure every community member has adequate and appropriate access, locally or via telehealth, to primary care and preventive services, emergency care, oral health services, behavioral health services, robust care coordination, appropriate diagnostic and outpatient therapy, and long-term care. Support and expand innovative efforts to recruit and retain health care professionals needed to deliver health care services in communities. Advocate for every community member to have a mechanism to receive timely health care services so that they do not delay care due to an inability to pay for services.Community Assets, Leadership and Engagement Create and support leadership development and training opportunities for a diverse group of natural leaders, both grassroots and grasstops, who are motivated to engage in locally led, strength-based strategies and initiatives. Promote better state agency and statewide organization engagement, coordination, and communication around the planning and implementation of programs to ensure the needs of communities are being met. Foster the development of sustainable financial models for communities, supplemented by sufficient community training specific to leveraging and aligning funding from income generation, public support, and private sources to sustain local projects and programming.HEALTH CARE TRANSFORMATION59 STATE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN Economic Development Ensure a diverse and well-trained workforce is actively matched with public, private, and entrepreneurial job opportunities, while removing barriers to employment. Increase technical assistance and training to support teams of community members and key local partners in their efforts to attract and leverage economic development opportunities. Coordinate and establish resource development opportunities and dedicated funding sources that communities can use to address their unique workforce development, growth, and quality of life challenges. Education Provide access to vocational, training, and higher education programs that will provide every student and community member the opportunity to develop skills that match with the jobs that are available to them. Expand access to affordable, full- day 3 and 4-year-old programs to all families. Ensure that every school district has an active Coordinated School Health Advisory Committee as outlined in the Student Health and Fitness Act (2005). Housing Repair and replace substandard housing units to improve the quality, safety, livability, accessibility, and energy efficiency of existing housing stock.
