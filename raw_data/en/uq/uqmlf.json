It does this on the emotional and spiritual planes. Sound can redress imbalances on every level of physiologic functioning. Therefore, it plays a positive role in the treatment of virtually any medical disorder. The sound healing therapy also uses crystal healing as an alternative medical technique in which crystals and other stones are used. Proponents of this technique believe that crystals act as conduits for healing \u2014 allowing positive, healing energy to flow into the body as negative energy flows out. They're thought to promote the flow of good energy and help rid the body and mind of negative energy for physical and emotional benefits. The key to indulging in this self-care experience is mindfulness, reflection, and acceptance. The use of crystals in such environments may help induce relaxation.
