Establishing legal and ethical norms for open source investigations will professionalize the field and, in doing so, increase the likelihood that such information will be useful for justice and accountability purposes. This process of developing the Berkeley Protocol was similar past efforts to develop standards around investigating [torture](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/publications/training8rev1en.pdf), [extrajudicial executions](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/MinnesotaProtocol.pdf), and [sexual violence in conflict](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/598335/International_Protocol_2017_2nd_Edition.pdf). These past initiatives were essential steps to help lawyers and judges better understand how to evaluate new investigative techniques, and guide first responders and civil society groups on how to collect information in a manner consistent with legal requirements. The Berkeley Protocol, which will serve as a resource for practitioners, as well as a valuable training and teaching tool, was launched on December 1, 2020, in a [ virtual event on the 75th anniversary of the Nuremberg Trials. ](https://youtu.be/O94wmuRH_cg) The Berkeley Protocol Coordinating Committee Ms. Lindsay Freeman, Senior Legal Researcher, Human Rights Center, University of California, Berkeley School of Law Dr. Alexa Koenig, Executive Director, Human Rights Center, University of California, Berkeley School of Law Mr. Eric Stover, Faculty Director, Human Rights Center, University of California, Berkeley School of Law The Berkeley Protocol Editorial Committee Ms. Sareta Ashraph, Senior Legal Consultant; Barrister, Garden Court Chambers; former Senior Analyst on UN Investigative Team to Promote Accountability for Crimes Committed by Da'esh Ms. Alix Dunn, Former Executive Director, The Engine Room Mr. Richard Goldstone, Former Justice of the Constitutional Court of South Africa; former Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda Ms. Brenda J.
