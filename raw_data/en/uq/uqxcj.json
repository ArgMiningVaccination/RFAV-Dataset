TCM, sometimes referred to as Eastern Medicine, is an ancient medicine that dates back at least 3,000 years ago. It is practiced today as a complete and holistic medical system to maintain or return one to health. Chinese Medicine has proven effective at benefiting a wide variety of issues, including Pain Management, Digestive issues, Emotional support, Chronic Fatigue, TMJ, Headaches, Infertility, and much more! Modalities include Acupuncture, Herbal Remedies, Cupping, Gua-Sha & Tuina Acupuncture Acupuncture is a natural, drug-free therapy that promotes feelings of relaxation and well-being by working with your nervous system to encourage self-healing. Fine, sterile, single-use needles are placed at specific acupoints located on meridian pathways of the body, often near peripheral nerves. These points are carefully selected through your intake and diagnosis to aid in balancing the bodies systems, increase circulation and reduce inflammation. Cupping, Gua-Sha and Tuina Traditional Chinese modalities that are used, as needed, to further move and circulate the Qi and stimulate blood flow. Cupping aids in lifting the fascia layer up off the muscle to promote deeper healing. Gua-sha, similar to cross-fiber friction in a deep tissue massage, utilizes a jade tool to create micro tears in the muscle, which speeds up the healing of certain injuries and can relieve pain. Tuina, also known as Asian Massage, encompasses a range of massage techniques to aid in recovery. Herbal Remedies Herbs, and combination of herbs into formulations, are a powerful compliment to your healing. Herbal Remedies and Acupuncture are the two main components to Traditional Chinese Medicine. Herbs are used to strengthen, build, and support the body or to clear it of excess problems like a cold, fever, or acute pain.

First Session 90 minutes Your first session includes a comprehensive review and intake of your medical history, a consultation, and an acupuncture treatment. If time remains, I am happy to work in other healing modalities as well. This is an important session to develop a working diagnosis of any imbalances within your body, mind and spirit, so please take your time in filling out your intake before your appointment for your own benefit.
