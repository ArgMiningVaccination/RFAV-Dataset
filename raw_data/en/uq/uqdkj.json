Executive Summary vii viiiBighorn Sheep Habitat Studies, Population Dynamics, and Population Modeling in Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area, 2000-2003 By Francis J. Singer and Kathryn A. Schoenecker, U.S. Geological Survey Executive Summary At the request of National Park Service resource managers, we began a study in 2000 to evaluate causes for the decline of the bighorn sheep ( Ovis canadensis ) population inhabiting Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area (BICA), the Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Range, and surrounding state and U.S. Forest Service lands in Montana and Wyoming. Our study consisted of radio-collaring adult rams and ewes with mortality sensors to monitor adult mortalities, tracking ewes to determine pregnancy and la mbing rates, habitat assessments to determine why the population was not expanding into what had been modeled using GIS methodology as suitable bighorn sheep habitat, measuring ungulate herbaceous consumption rates and herbaceous production to determine plant responses, and aerial and boat surveys to determine bighorn sheep population range and population dynamics (Schoenecker and others, this report). Two habitat suitability models were created and conducted (Gudorf, this report; Wockner and others, this report) using different methodologies, and comparisons made between the two. Herd population dynamics were modeled using the POP-II and POP-III programs (Roelle, this report), and a reassessment of ungulate exclosures that were established 8-10 years ago was conducted (Gerhardt, this report). The bighorn sheep population of the greater Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area (BICA) was extirpated in the 1800s, and then reintroduced in 1973. The herd increased to a peak population of about 211 animals (Kissell and others, 1996), but then declined sharply in 1995 and 1996. Causes for the decline were unknown. Numbers have remained around 100 \u00b1 20 animals since 1998. Previous modeling efforts determined what areas were suitable bighorn sheep habitat (Gudorf and others, 1996). We tried to determine why sheep were not using areas that were modeled as suitable or acceptable habita t, and to evaluate populati on dynamics of the herd. Methods We conducted our 3-year study from 2000-2002. We used radio-telemetry on 30 collared bighorn sheep (~1/3 of herd) and collected daily VHF signals to monitor adult mortality and population range, and tracked ewes to determine lambing rates during the lambing season. We gathered data on habitat parameters for bighorn sheep to evaluate areas they were using and comp ared them to areas they did not use. We evaluated nutrient concentrations in key forage species for bighorn sheep and compared habitat areas for differences. To esti mate population size, we flew annual aerial helicopter surveys, conducted boat surveys along Bighorn Lake, and monitored radio-collar locations with fixed-wing surveys. Plant production and structural responses to ungulate herbivory were evaluated by measuring plants and clipping plants inside and outside of ungulate grazing exclosures that were established 8-10 years ago. We measured ungulate c onsumption rates across the range. After gathering several years of empirical data, we used the data to develop a habitat suitability model using bighorn sheep locations, and conducted a reanalysis of a previous habitat suitability model for the greater BICA area. Population estimates and sex ratios were used to run the POP-II and POP-III models in order to evaluate population dynamics of the herd and make management predictions. ix Results Results of our research indicate that disease played a primary role in the decline of the herd in 1995. We found evidence of Mannheimia haemolytica in 42% of the bighorns sampled, and 82% had high concentrations of antibodies in their blood for para influenza, suggesting they had been at least exposed to it. We have no historic baseline for predation rates on this herd, but current predatio n does not appear to be taki ng a large percent of adult sheep (6 of 13 mortalities). We were not able to determin e predation on lambs, but we did radio-track ewes every 2 weeks during lambing season and determin ed that 21% of lambs survived to 1 year old in 2001 and 44% in 2002. We suspect closure of Bighorn Lake to human recreation and boating in 2002 due to lack of water in the lake helped increase survivorship of lamb s that year. Bighorn sheep nursery groups were observed all summer foraging on the lakebed sandbars on the lake bottom and there was no human activity from boats or jet skis. Also, bighorn sheep were more secure from predation by bears and mountain lions because larger predator s could not readily access the lake bottom due to steep slopes on both sides of the lake. Consumption rates of vegetation were higher on the shared wild horse-bighorn sheep range (winter consumption \u00b1 s.e. = 37.0 \u00b1 6.0 in shared range, 23.4 \u00b1 5.7 in bighorn-only range, P = 0.1280; and summer consumption = 15.6 \u00b1 5.1 on shared range, 14.9 \u00b1 7.5 on bighorn-only range, P = 0.8336), as might have been expected where two grazing u ngulates share a range. Howeve r, the area where they shared the range (the Dry Head) was better bighorn sheep habitat for a number of reasons. First, the Dry Head had more mountain mahogany habitat, which bighorn sheep appear to rely on in BICA, especially in winter. Second, our nutrient analyses suggested the Dry Head had higher concentrations of palatable nutrients in summer especially. Thirdly, the horizontal visibility for bighorn sheep was statistically higher on the Dry Head -- even within the same vegetation types -- than other areas, due to smaller shrub sizes. The quality of habitat for bighor n sheep appears to be better on the Dry Head than other areas, although selenium levels in soil were lower on th e Dry Head than areas to the west. Lower herbaceous production on the Dry Head compared to areas further north did not appear to deter sheep from concentrating there in both summer and winter. Lastly, habitat modeling indicated that there is more overall suitable habitat for bighorn sheep on the Dry Head where th ey share the range with wild horses than other areas. Although competition in the past is difficult to decipher, our data suggested no obvious negative effect of horse grazing or the presence of wild horses on bighorn sheep. Bighorn sheep demographic patterns did not differ between the wild horse-bighorn sheep and bighorn-only areas. We found no differences in pregnancy rates, lambing rates, or lamb survivorship in bighorn sheep inhabiting areas on versus off the wild horse range (pregnancy rate of ewes (\u00b1 s.e.) was 77 \u00b1 4%, and lambing rate was 68 \u00b1 5%, overall), although our sample sizes were small. This finding is in general agreement with those of Kissell and others (1996) and Coughenour (2000), who found little overlap in use of resources. Kissell and others (1996) and Coughenour (2000) found considerable spatial and habitat separation. Even where habitats were shared, diets tended to be largely different between the two species. Our body condition analysis indicated that body m easurements and body weights of bighorn sheep were smaller in BICA than a herd in Alberta, Canada, but this may be due to climate and elevation differences. Body mass is correlated with survival in both adults and lambs (Festa-Bianchet and others, 1997), but since we could not compare BICA sheep to any other herds in Wyoming or Montana due to lack of published data, we do not know if smaller body mass could be associated with poorer body condition and thus th e decline of the herd. The population dynamics modeling (POP-II and POP-III) showed that in order for this herd to increase so rapidly for ~20 years after reintroduction (r =0.23), there must have been very little mortality coupled with very high reproductive success. This rapid increase following a translocation has been reported in other herds (McCarty and Miller, 1998). Annual adult survival rates for this herd from February 2000 to January 2003 were about 90%. Based on 15-year modeling projections, a harvest of < 2 rams/year is appropriate and consistent with NPS goals of increasing the size of the herd. The vegetation analysis of ungulate grazing exclosures indicated that total biomass and grass biomass was significantly higher inside than outside all exclosures, while forb biomass was lower inside exclosures. Grazing effects were detected for total plant cove r, litter cover, and absolute and relative grass cover which were all lower in grazed plots than exclosed plots. Bare ground was higher in grazed plots. Species richness was lower in grazed plots. x Frequency of cushion plant species1 was the same in grazed and exclosed plots on the Dry Head, suggesting ungulate grazing on the Dry Head is not affecting cushion pl ants. Plots in areas of historic cattle trailing, however, showed significantly different cover and frequencies for some species of cushion plants than nearby native plots that had not been trailed in > 20 years. Correlations of bi omass, precipitation, and horse population indicated that negative grazing effects from higher horse populations are mitigated by precipitation. Habitat modeling for bighorn sheep and wild horses showed that there is considerable unused bighorn sheep habitat (both winter and summer) north of currently occupied areas, along the Bighorn Lake canyon and in Devil's Canyon. Suitable habitat for bighorn sheep in Crooked Creek, Big Coulee, and West Pryor was more limited. Horizontal visibility for bighorn sheep differed within the same vegetation type (e.g., juniper type) on different parts of the range, and the Dry Head area had the highest visib ility for bighorn sheep of the 4 study areas sampled (Big Coulee, Crooked Creek, Dry Head, and Barry's Landing). Management Recommendations We recommend the following management actions: 1. Conduct habitat treatments (burning and thinning) to improve habitat for bighorn sheep, particularly in areas of decreased visibility (< 55%) such as the Barry's Landing area and north of Barry's Island where all other habitat characteristic s for bighorn sheep are present. 2. Continue radio-tracking and monitoring bighorn sheep. Population modeling indicated that more data is needed to better predict population characteristics of this herd. Sample sizes need to be increased. Also, sex ratios of new lambs, and better age and sex ratios of adults would be useful. 3. Encourage dispersal or translocate bighorn sheep to the northern end of Bighorn Lake, and consider improving habitat in southern end of the canyon to increase dispersal. Consider burning or thinning treatments in areas that add useable clusters of suita ble habitat that can support new nursery bands, as opposed to small isolated patches of habitat. Consider connecting habitats. Big Coulee, West Pryor, and the northwest periphery of the study area were not as favorable for bighorn sheep, and we encourage focusing on improving other habitat areas first. 4. Supplement selenium to the herd using selenium blocks. Selenium levels in plants and feces were consistently on the low end of the acceptable range. Hi gher selenium levels in the diets may bolster the immune systems of adult bighorn sheep and help lamb survivorship.

Population Dynamics and Modeling 1 2Bighorn Sheep ( Ovis canadensis) Survivorship and Habitat Studies in Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area and Surrounding Lands, Wyoming and Montana, 2000-2003 By Kathryn A. Schoenecker, Francis J. Singer, Kayla A. Grams, and James E. Roelle, U.S. Geological Survey 3 Introduction In the 1850s, bighorn sheep ( Ovis canadensis ) were numerous and distributed throughout the Bighorn and Pryor Mountains of Montana and Wyoming. After European settlement, bighorn sheep populations declined, and local extinctions occurred in much of their historic ra nge in the western United Stat es. The current bighorn sheep population of Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area (BICA) is the product of several reintroductions into BICA and surrounding lands. Following a release in 1973 and growth rates near maximum potential of 19.8% per year, the population grew to an estimated peak population of about 211 animals in 1993 and 1994 (Kissell and others, 1996). Recent counts indicate the bighorn sheep population has de clined. Kissell and others (1996) reported that the population began to decline rapidly in 1995 and 1996. He noted low ewe:lamb ratios during the decline phase. Bighorn sheep numbers declined to the lowest minimum viable population size of 100 animals recommended by several bighorn sheep experts (Bailey, 1990; Berger, 1990; Smith and others, 1991). National Park Service (NPS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) managers were c oncerned about the decline and requested a study of its causes. In 2000, the U.S. Ge ological Survey- Biological Resources Divi sion (USGS-BRD) receive d funding to start a 3-year study of survivorship, condition, and population growth rate of the BICA bighorn sheep population. Several possibilities exist for the bighorn sheep decline. The herd may have experienced a rapid population expansion, followed by a decline to stability at a lower long-term carrying capacity. This pattern of apparently overshooting carrying capacity following an initial release has been reported for a number of ungulates (Caughley, 1976). Disease may have caused the decline; predation and/or competition with wild horses ( Equus caballus ) may also have been factors. A spatial model of wild horse carrying capacity (Coughenour, 1999) was developed to assist managers in evaluating wild horse population numbers. Studies of summer consumption rates by wild horses and other ungulates were conducted by James Detling and students from Colorado State University (Peterson and others, 1997; Gerhardt and Detling, 1998; Fahnestock, 1998). Diets and habitat use of wild horses, bighorn sheep and mule deer were studied by Coates and Schemnitz (1989) and Kissell and others (1996). Both Coates and Schemnitz (1989) and Kissell and others (1996) reported a high degree of dietary overlap between wild horses and bighorn sheep. However, Kissell and others (1996) concluded that a hi gh degree of spatial separation between wild horses and bighorn sheep, at least under the study conditions, precluded any significant negative competitive influences. The most important overlap of bighorn sheep and wild horses seems to be on winter range. Competition can be difficult to determine, since current conditions may not reveal co mpetition that has already o ccurred. Managers remained concerned about the declining bighorn population for the following reasons: 1. Lamb:ewe ratios and population estimates plummeted in 1995 and 1996. There had been a large wild horse gather and removal from the range in fall 1994, so wild horse numbers were not high at this time. 2. Kissell and others (1996) raised concerns about predation and disease, as bighorn sheep populations are highly susceptible to rapid die-offs from disease epizootics (Onderka and Wishart, 1984), and bighorns with lowered body condition due to disease would be at greater risk of predation. 3. The Big Coulee area, especially the low elevation, exposed knife-like ri dges and steep slopes to the east of Big Coulee, is a relatively snow-free area and has been mapped by a GIS-based habitat model as suitable bighorn sheep winter range (Gudorf, 2002), but bighorn sheep were rarely observed there. But similar steep canyon habitat to the west and just outside of the wild horse range in Crooked Creek canyon was also mapped as suitable and was colonized by a small gr oup of bighorn sheep lambs and ewes (Kissell and others, 1996). However, this area was not used after 1996 with the exception of occasional sightings, and bighorns were not using what seemed to be suitable habitat elsewhere in the area. Bighorn sheep occupied <15% of the area rated as suitable by Singer and others (2000a). Our objectives for the study were to: 1. Evaluate current disease problems and mortality rate s, including predation rates, in bighorn sheep through captures and monitoring of bighorn sheep. 2. Determine winter spatial relations of wild horses and bighorn sheep through aerial surveys of winter range. 4 3. Conduct habitat measurements to determine why bighorn sheep were not using what had been mapped with a GIS-based habitat model as suitable bighorn sheep habitat, and sample winter and summer consumption rates of key forage species to see if there were other factors precluding use of these areas by bighorn sheep. 4. Compare winter lamb recruitment rates and total vegetation consumption rates on bighorn sheep winter use areas, with and without wi ld horses present. 5. Complete year-round GIS-based distribution maps for wild horses and bighorn sheep in order to identify key areas of species overlap and key areas of species separation for potential habitat improvements. NPS park staff asked USGS to answ er the following questions: (a) how large is the population?; (b) how many rams are in the population?; (c) in addition to low lamb recruitment, is mortality or dispersal of adults likely contributing to the decline?; and (d) is trophy hunting of rams contributing to the decline? Literature Review Disease Research has shown that diseases, es pecially bronchopneumonia due to pasteurellosis, can kill bighorns of all ages. Pasteurellosis is a contagious disease of domestic and wild ruminants, and epizootic outbreaks have caused widespread mortality and major die-offs in bighorn sheep (Potts, 1937; Onderka and Wishart, pasteurellosis in sheep include nasal discharge and infrequent coughing (Gilmour and Gilmour, 1989; Miller and others, 1991). During an initial outbreak bighorn sheep of all ages die, followed by very low lamb survival for several years (Foreyt, 1990). After th e initial outbreak, most adults are apparently immune and are no longer susceptible, but lambs carry no such immu nity. Once passive immunity from colostrum in ewes wanes, lambs succumb and continue to die for two years after onset of the disease (Foreyt, 1990). If a population has a chronic pasteurellosis problem, lambs most typically succumb at 4-8 weeks of age (28-56 days). Initial high lamb:ewe ratios may be observed, but they are typically fo llowed by low ratios by late summer. There is evidence that stressed bighorn sheep are more susceptible to pneumonic pasteurellosis than bighorn sheep that are not stressed (Kraabel and Miller, 1997). No vaccine for pasteurellosis ( Manhiemia haemolytica ) currently exists (Foreyt, 1992). Some experimental vaccines have been attempted with litt le success (Cassirer and othe rs, 2001); but nothing is available in a useable format at this time (Miller and others, 1997; Kraabel and others, 1998). Selenium Selenium is an essential nutrient (trace element) that prevents oxidation of unsaturated fats in cell membranes (Robbins, 1993). When selenium is deficient in the diets of animals and this oxidation occurs, muscle membranes rupture and the muscle tissue becomes nonfunctional and turns white. This is called \"white muscle disease\" (Robbins, 1993). Selenium deficiency in bighor n sheep probably occurs when whole blood concentrations or plant dry matter selenium levels fall below 0.05 ppm (Hebert and McTaggart-Cowan, 1971). In one study, mountain goats with blood selenium concentrations as low as 0.014 ppm were highly susceptible to capture myopathy (Robbins and others, 1995). Selenium deficiency has been implicated in low lamb survivorship and population decline of the Whiskey Basin, Wyoming, bighorn sheep herd (Hnilicka and others, 2001). Nutrients Proteins are major constituents of animals' bodies, and a continuous supply of dietary protein must be available to animals for a host of functio ns. Deficiencies in the essential amin o acids that make up proteins will reduce growth and reproduction (Robbins, 1993). Wildlife nutritionists have typically determined the nitrogen content of food in order to provide an index of its protein content. Nitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient for plants and animals. Plants obtain the majority of their nitrogen from the soil by absorp tion through the roots, while herbivores 5 get it primarily from plants. Carbon is another organic constituent, like N, and is an essential nutrient. Measures of dry matter digestibility (Dmd) and acid detergent fiber (Adf) provide an index to the digestibility of plant material by ungulates and other wildlife (Robbins, 1993). Digestibility is important because not all plant parts are useable by vertebrates. While energy is expended consuming plants, no t all of the plant material pr ovides energy (gained) in digestion. Cellulose and lignin are struct ural carbohydrates of plant cell walls that provide rigidity and are largely indigestible by vertebrates (Robbins, 1993). Other trace elements that are important or relevant to bighorn sheep include iron, zinc, manganese, molybdenum, and copper. Iron is important for hemoglobin and is a component of many enzymes. Iron deficiency causes weight loss, impaired brain and immune function, and anemia (Robbins, 1993). Zinc is essential for the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and proteins, and zinc-deficient diets cause retarded growth, hair loss and rough hair coat, weight loss, impaired reproduction, impaired wound healing, and increased susceptibility to infections (Robbins, 1993). Manganese is necessary for bone formation and en ergy metabolism, and deficien cies cause reduced growth or weight loss, impaired reproduction, nervous disorders, slipped tendons, and bone malformations (Robbins, 1993). Molybdenum is an important component of enzymes, and deficiencies cause reduced growth. Copper is necessary for hemoglobin and melanin formation and is a component of blood proteins and enzyme systems. Copper deficiencies in wild ruminants have occurred world-wide. Symptoms include pale, faded, brittle pelage, osteoporosis and fractures, abnormal hoof and antler growth, impaired movement, weight loss, reduced reproduction, and sudden death (Robbins, 1993). Thus, copper-deficient animals in the wild would be highly susceptible to predation. Copper deficiencies have also been reported to alter immune response in humans and animals (Minatel and Carfagnini, 2000). Innate immune response is impaired in ruminants with copper deficiencies, but not acquired immune function (Minatel and Carfagnini, 2000). Predation Some theories about predator-prey relationships sugg est that predation may increase due to variables like overpopulation or chance. Predation may weed out the debi litated, the too numerous, and the unfortunate (Cain and others, 1972). Caughley (1976) suggested that predators were not capable of stopping ungulate population irruptions. McCullough (1979) believed that wolves ( Canis lupus ) could not drive white tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) to low population densities because density-dependent factors of deer condition would decrease their vulnerability to predation. Other research on ungulates an d predation contends that the group behavior of bighorn sheep greatly reduces their vulnerability to predation and that predation is unlikely to cause a population decline in bighorn sheep herds (Hornocker, 1970; Buechner, 1960). However, in an 8-year study of bighorn sheep herds in the Sierra Nevada and Granite Mountains of California, Wehausen (1996) found that mountain lions were the primary cause of decline of two herds of bighorn sheep. Predation by mountain lions caused bighorns to abandon seasonal winter range, giving up nutritional advantages of migration and eventually delaying timing of lambing by one month. Lambs born later had lower survivorship to yearling age, and the population dropped further (Wehausen, 1996). Annual survivorship of adult ewes in Wehausen's (1996) study averaged 62.5% in the first 3 years. Wehausen (1996) concluded that group behavior of bighorn sheep was not sufficient to prevent population declines from mountain lion predation. Mountain lions are the most important feline predator on bighorn sheep (Kelly, 1980). Mountain lions that had home ranges overlapping bighorn sheep habitat rarely killed sheep, while other individual lions preyed heavily on sheep, suggesting that mountain lion predation on bighorn sheep is an individual, learned behavior (Ross and others, 1997). Thus, for bighorn sheep that occur in small, isolated groups, the presence of a few such predators may strongly influence their survival rates and behavior (Ross and others, 1997). Ross and others (1997) reported that bighorn sheep incurred 34% over-winter mortality due to cougars in Alberta, Canada. Some reports indicate that predator control efforts have contributed to increased lamb survival (Halloran, 1949), while others believe that controlling predators has had little effect (Russo, 1956). 6 Hunting Effects Since the 1970's there has been concern about possible negative effects of trophy hunting on mountain sheep. Biologists have observed a strict dominance hier archy in rams. Class IV rams, the largest-horned rams typically 8-years or older, obtained most copulations. These large-horned and older rams courted ewes in a more deliberate, controlled fashion (Geist, 1971; Nichols, 1972). Younger rams were usually restricted from breeding, and when they did get an opportunity they courted ewes aggressively, with few displays and much chasing. The suspected negative effects of trophy hunting fell into tw o major concerns. The first involved possible negative effects on ewe energetics and reproduction from harassment by the young rams. This first hypothesis has never been demonstrated. Trophy hunted herds, even the most heavily hunted herds, produce and recruit equivalent numbers of lambs, and ewe survival rates are also equivalent (Nichols, 1972; Jorgenson and others, 1997; Singer and Zeigenfuss, 2002). Apparently, even though young rams in hunted herds may harass ewes more, this is canceled out by the fact there are fewer rams in hunted herds to cour t ewes (Singer and Zeigenfuss, 2002). Breedings may be a few days later in trophy hunted herds (Nichols, 1972; Singer and Zeigenfuss, 2002), but apparently births still fall within the optimum period for survival of lambs. Birth date s would have to be several weeks later, not several days later, to reduce lamb survival (Bunnell, 1980, 1982). There is considerable evidence to support the second hypothesis, however -- that of depressed survival of young rams in hunted herds (Heimer and others, 1984; Jorgenson and others, 1997; Singer and Zeigenfuss, 2002). Young rams participate more in rut activities in hunted herds. As a result of increased energy expenditures just before winter, these young rams have higher rates of mortality than is typical of prime breeding (> 8 year-old) rams (Jorgenson and others, 1997; Singer and Zeigenfuss, 2002). Guidelines to Avoid Depresse d Survival of Young Rams No magic guidelines exist that will apply in all situations. The typical healthy mountain sheep population of 100 animals (census N) recruits 5-6 rams into legal size (~ 4 yr old, or \u00bd curl) category each year (Geist, 1971; Wishart, 1986). Conservative harvests of about 1.5% of census N (population size) of Dall sheep across broad areas of Alaska (Heimer, 1985) resulted in no detectable depressed survival of sublegal ( \u00bd curl) rams (Murphy and others, 1991). Two herds harvested at 3% of census N showed no statistically significant effects (Singer and others, 2000b), although in one of the herds there were nonsignificant tendencies to lower survival. Heimer and Watson (1986) also predicted that a harvest of 3% of census N could be sustained for Dall sheep. The province of Alberta aims to harvest about two-thirds of the recruitment of rams to legal size, or about 4% of census N per year -- but this may be too high, since depressed survival of young rams was documented in two Alberta herds (Ram Mountain and Sheep River; Jorgenson and others, 1997). Intense harvest of all or nearly all of the recruitment of rams to legal size (i.e. 5-6% of census N) resulted in depressed survival of young rams in two highly accessible Dall sheep populations in Alaska, Dry Creek (Heimer and others, 1984) and Usibelli (Singer and others, 2000b). Therefore, 3% harvest of census N (i.e., less than one-half of the ra m recruitment to legal size each year) seems to be a safe harvest for healthy herds. Harvests should be more conservative in declining or diseased herds. Study Area Our study area includes BICA, portions of Custer National Forest, and BLM lands (with some interspersed private lands) in the East and West Pryor Mountains. The Pryo r Mountains contain a maze of canyons, limestone caves, and steep ridges. Mountain slopes are forested, but alpine-like meadows, dryland flats, and less vegetated canyons intersperse with forested areas (Gudorf and others, 1996). Elevation ranges from 900-2500 m (Gudorf and others, 1996). BICA was established in 1966, following construction of the Yellowtail Dam by the Bureau of Reclamation. The dam channeled the fl ow of the Bighorn River into a 100-km long lake. The park spans the Montana-Wyoming stateline and encompasses > 28,000 ha of land. There is a strong precipitation gradient in the park, varying from approximately 15 cm annually at the south (upstream) end of the park and 45 cm at the north end 7 (Knight and others, 1987). Vertical canyon walls are up to 1,700 m high, containing limestone caves and talus slopes. Vegetation communities in the park have been categorized by Knight and others (1987), and include desert shrubland, juniper woodland, mountain mahogany woodland, sagebrush steppe, basin grassland, juniper/mountain mahogany woodland, riparian, and coniferous woodland. The climate is characterized by long cold winters and hot dry summers, but diversity in geography creates locally variable weather conditions (Gudorf and others, 1996). Semi-arid conditions along the Dry Head area of the park are contrasted with sub-alpine zones at higher elevations in the Pryor Mountains. Methods Our 3-year study in BICA was conducted from 2000-2002. We also conducted research on the wild horses of the Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Range (PMWHR) from 1992 through 2000. To focus our sampling on several opportunistic features of the wild horse range grazing system and to answer questions concerning possible competition between the two species, we divided the study area into 4 zones based on densities of ungulates (Figure 1). The Dry Head (DH) area of the park is habitat with high densities of both bighorn sheep and wild horses in summer, and high density of sheep in winter. North of the DH and north of the wild horse range boundary is the Barry's Landing (BL) area with bighorn sheep but no wild horses. The Big Coulee (BC) area contains high winter densities of wild horses but no known established groups of bighorn sheep (although th ey have access to the area), and the Crooked Creek (CC) area contains low densities of both bighorn sheep and wild horses. All of these areas are inhabited by mule deer ( Odocoileus hemionus ) also. Population Estimates To estimate bighorn population size, we conducted 1-2 aerial helic opter surveys/year in the fall and sometimes spring. Methodology for the bighorn sheep survey followed that of Unsworth and others (1994) for the Idaho sightability model. This involved stratifying the area into no sheep, low, and moderate-high density strata. All of the high and a random sample of the low-density count units were flown in tight contours. Known sheep and mule deer ranges were surveyed in grid patterns about 1/4-1/3 mile apart. The sheep range was divided into 14 count units. Sighting conditions during the flight for each group were recorded (activity of sheep, percent vegetation cover, percent snow cover, group size, sun/shade, position of helicopter), and a population estimate and confidence intervals were generated following the Idaho Sightability model for bighorn sheep (Unsworth and others, 1994). Animals were classified by sex an d age and lamb:ewe ratios recorded. To estimate wild horse populations, we used a photo ID system, as recogn izable markings permit identification of all individual horses. All harem stallions and nearly all mares and young can be recognized from a helicopter. All locations were recorded with a GPS unit in the aircraft and later plotted in a GIS along with habitat features (slope, elevation, cover vegetation type, exposure) generated from UTM locations. To determine distribution of sheep, we flew 4 aerial fixed-wing surveys/year and conducted 4-5 boat surveys/summer to monitor canyon cliffs for ewes and lambs. All sheep locations were recorded. Also, bighorn sheep locations were recorded by ground crews when animals were seen near th e road or from vantage points along the road. Additional efforts were made to search for rams. Separate survey flights were flown in July 1998, with little success, and in early rut 1999. Both of these flights were funded by NPS due to concerns over fewer observations of rams by park staff. USGS-BRD scientist F. Singer sp ent 3 days in November and 5 days in December 1999 classifying and searching for rams. All the rams observed fro m the air and from the ground were classified into 6 curl classes (1/4, 3/8, 1/2, 5/8, 3/4, 7/8, and 8/8). F. Singer also counted growth rings on rams during ground rut observations. Previous population estimates for the area (Kissell and others, 1996), from 1993-96, were based on the joint hypergeometric estimator of the Lincoln-Peterson index using marked animals (NOREMARK, White and 8 Figure 1. The four study areas in Bighorn Canyon National Recr eation Area, the Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Range, and surrounding lands, delineated based on density of wild horses and bighorn sheep. 9 Burnham, 1999). Kissell and others (1996) also sampled ram and ewe ratios during extensive ground and aerial searches for bighorn sheep groups containing radio-collared animals. We compared our population estimates from the Idaho Sightability model (Unsworth and others, 1994) to NOREMARK (White and Burnham, 1999) estimates reported by previous researchers (Kissell and others, 1996). Bighorn Sheep Monitori ng and Survivorship We radio-collared 23 bighorn sheep in 2000 (8 rams, 15 ewes), and 20 additional bighorn sheep in 2001 (8 rams, 12 ewes). No neonates were collared. We collected blood samples from bighorns to evaluate concentrations of copper, zinc, iron, and molybdenum. In 2000, radio collars were equipped with mortality sensors (Advanced Telemetry Systems, model 9c) that activat ed after 8 hours. In 2001, we set the collars to activate mortality signals after only 4 hours to decrease the time between mortality an d notification. Also, we found that collars could be reactivated to a normal signal if scavengers moved or shoo k the carcass/collar. Six radio co llars failed or shorted-out during the study. Bighorn sheep were monitored daily (every-other-day on weekends) for mortality signals from January 2000-May 2003. Mortality signals were investigated within 1-3 days, depending on how fast the collar could be located, and cause of death determined at the site of the carcass or remains. Any remains were sent to the Wyoming State Vet Lab, Laramie, for analysis or necropsy. Photographs were taken at e ach mortality site and date, time, location, field estimated cause of death, estimated time/date of death, age, and sex of bighorn sheep were also recorded. Population Range of Bighor n Sheep and Wild Horses We conducted fixed-wing surveys 5-7x/year in summer and winter to locate radio-collared animals and determine the population range of bighorn sheep. We also tracked bighorn sheep on the ground, locating collared ewes every 2 weeks and collared rams every month from April-September in 2001 and 2002. Wild horse locations were monitored daily throughout summer months in all study years, and 1-2 aerial surveys/year were conducted to determine wild horse population range. Predation We evaluated predation on bighorn sheep by monitoring mortalities of adults. Each mortality was investigated to determine cause of death of the animal. In addition, we collected 11 skulls and carcass remains in the field to conduct observational analyses following the me thods of Kunkel (K. Kunkel , Montana State University- Bozeman, unpubl. data) to determine cause of death when possible. Remains were categorized as either \"depredated\" or \"unknown.\" Pregnancy of Ewes We collected blood samples at the time of capture in 2000 and 2001 to test for pregnancy. Pregnancy tests (progesterone analysis) on blood were conducted by BioTracking, Moscow, Idaho in 2000 and the University of California, Davis in 2001. In addition, we collected fresh fecal samples from collared ewes for pregnancy analysis by fecal steroid metabolites. With both blood and fecal samplin g, we tested 15 ewes in 2000, 18 ewes in 2001, 16 ewes in 2002, and 21 ewes in 2003. Most of the sa me ewes were sampled each year (t hose with collars), so samples were not independent of each other. Analysis of fecal samples was conducted by the Science and Conservation Center at Zoo Montana in Billings, Mo ntana. Fecal samples were collected from March-May each year, frozen in plastic bags, and stored until analysis. 10 Lamb Survivorship We tracked and located collared ewes every 2 weeks fr om lambing season until late fall (May-September) in 2001 and 2002 to determine lambing success and survivorship of lambs. Ewes were followed and observers recorded whether the ewe had a lamb or the lamb was missing, sex of lamb when possible, location of the bighorn sheep group, and group composition. Winter Body Conditi on of Bighorn Sheep We collected chest girth measurements on 16 bighorn sheep at the time of capture in 2001 for analysis. We compared chest girth measurements of bighorn sheep from BICA to a herd in Alberta, Canada (Blood and others, 1970). We were not able to use chest girth size as an indi cator of winter body condition because we did not find any studies in Wyoming or Montana to which we could comp are our chest girth measurem ents. We compared body weights of 6 bighorn sheep collected at the time of capture in 2001 to weights from a wild herd in Alberta, Canada (Jorgenson and Wishart, 1984) and from captive bighorn sheep (Woolf, 1971). Published information on body weights of bighorn sheep is rare, pres umably because capturing and recapturin g wild bighorn sheep is too difficult and costly (Festa-Bianchet and others, 1997). Presence of Disease We used blood samples collected at the time of capture in 2000 and 2001 to determine presence or absence of disease isolates and disease titers. We collected blood, pharyngeal, nasa l, fecal, and ear swab samples from captured animals. Samples were tested for the presence of mites, lungworm, Pasteurella , and bluetongue. All analyses for disease were conducted at the Wyoming State Veterinary Lab, La ramie. We collected fecal samples at the time of capture to evaluate for parasites. We also coll ected 5 fecal samples in 2002 fo r parasitology analysis at the Wyoming State Veterinary Lab. Competition Between Bighorn Sheep and Wild Horses To determine if bighorn sheep were compromised in habi tats where they shared th e range with wild horses, we evaluated bighorn sheep mortality rates, pregnancy rates, lambing rates, and lamb survivorship in areas shared with wild horses versus areas not shared with wild horses. Because wild horses were only found in areas that were also inhabited by bighorn sheep, we were not able to test the opposite hypothesis, i.e., that wild horses might have been compromised in areas where they shared the range with bighorn sheep. Habitat Characteristics To identify key habitat characteristics for bighorn sheep in BICA and surrounding lands, we measured habitat parameters from May-July, 2000 and 2001 in known bighorn sheep use areas (determined by either direct observation of bighorn sheep or fresh fecal sign; Figure 2). Measuremen ts taken included slope, aspect, herbaceous groundcover, shrub density by species, horizontal visibility (Johnson and Swift, 1995), distance to escape terrain, primary vegetation type using categories of Knight and others (1987), and average % ground cover of grass, forbs, rock, moss, cactus, lichen, wood, shrub, and bare ground. We compared these habitat parameters between our 4 study areas. We also compared areas used by wild horses and bighorn sheep versus areas used only by bighorn sheep. We compared the 4 study areas to determine if there were differences in habitat that may have prevented bighorn sheep from using areas that have been modeled as suitable bighorn sheep habitat by Gudorf and others (1996) and Gudorf (2002). 11 Figure 2 . Locations of bighorn sheep habitat parameter measurements taken in Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area and surrounding lands, 2000-2001. 12 Rates of Forage Consumption by Ungulates We used 1-m2 grazing utilization cages and permanent exclosures to measure seasonal offtake by ungulates for three years in summer 2000, 2001 and 2002, and in winters 2000-2001, 2001-2002, and 2002-2003. We selected areas of similar slope , aspect, elevation, and vegetation type to establish paired sites to compare areas on versus off the wild horse range (Figure 3). Sites were set up in grazed versus ungrazed plots with 3 cages per site. Plant material was clipped in July and in September for summer offtake, and in early April before spring greenup for winter offtake using a \u00bc-m2 metal ring to clip equal amounts in grazed and ungrazed plots. Plan t material was then placed in paper bags, oven dried at 41 \u00b0C for 12-24 hours, weighed, and analyzed by the difference method: % Consumption = 100 x (Bi - B )/Bi o where Bi = dry weight of biomass inside grazing cage, and B o = dry weight of biomass outside cage. Researchers also estimated the amount of ground cover in each metal ring before clipping, and recorded % cover of grass, forbs, rock, lichen, moss, wood, cactus, and ba re ground. Grazing utilization cages we re removed from all field locations in April and May 2003. We analyzed data using paired t-tests. We conducted linear regression analys is to test the following hypotheses : did winter offtake affect summer production, did summer offtake affect the next summer's production, did June offtake affect September production, and did both summer and winter offtake affect the next summer's production? Herbaceous Production We measured herbaceous production using the offtake plots described above. Peak standing crop was calculated as the amount of biomass clipped in the ungrazed plot in June. For total summer production, plots were clipped and weighed in June at peak greenup, cages moved, and clipped again in September to measure initial peak growth, and any compensatory growth from grazing. We calculated production following Bonham (1989) where June ungrazed biomass is added to September ungrazed biomass minus September offtake to get total production for the season. We analyzed data using paired t-tests from our paired plots on and off the wild horse range. Nutritional Analysis of Vegetation To measure nutrient concentrations in bighorn sheep forage, we collected samples of the 3 most preferred species of grass for bighorn sheep in the area (Kissell and others, 1996), including Stipa comata ( needle shrub Cercocarpus ledifolius (mountain mahogany) to determine if there were differences in nutritional content between the 4 study areas. Three comp osite samples consisting of 5 individual plants each ( 15 plants/site/season) were collected in late winter and also at pe ak growing season in 2001 and 2002. Samples were collected in the four study areas (Dry Head, Barry's Landing, Crooked Creek, and Big Coulee) in specific areas of known bighorn sheep use. Plant samples were oven dried at 41 \u00b0C for 12-24 hours. Samples were analyzed for % content of N, C, acid detergent fiber (Adf), cellulose, lignin, and protein by LECO (Laboratory Equipment Corporation, St. Joseph, MI) CNH analyzer, and for dry matter digestibility (Dmd) by in vitro digestibility. N, C, Dmd, Adf, cellulose, and lignin analyses were conducted at the Range Nutrition Lab, Colorado State Univer sity, Fort Collins, Colorado. We analyzed selenium levels in plants at the Olsen Biochemistry Lab at South Dakota State University. Selenium We measured soil selenium content in 5 vegetation types in each of the 4 habitat areas: Big Coulee, Crooked Creek, Barry's Landing, and Dry Head. Soil cores were taken to 10 cm in depth in September 2003 and analyzed using extraction methodology by the Olsen Biochemi stry Laboratory at South Da kota State University for 13 Figure 3.

We also collected fecal samples from ewes, rams, and lambs on the 22nd of each month in 2002 for a complete year. Fecal samples were collected by using radio-collared animals to find bighorn sheep groups, visually observing them until they defecated, and then collecting 10-12 pellets from each animal in the group. Age and sex of each animal was recorded. We collected feces from as many bighorn sheep as we could find in one day. Sample sizes for each month ranged from 5 to 14. Samples were oven-dried and stored in paper bags until analysis. Fecal samples were analyzed for fecal nitrogen (fecal-N) content and percent selenium by the Olsen Biochemistry Laborato ry at South Dakota State University. Statistical Analyses We used SAS statistical software version 8 for all anal yses (SAS Institute, 1988). We present differences at the P 0.10 level. We used ANOVA procedures for comparisons between the 4 study areas, and corrected for lack of homogeneity of variances where necessary with Welch's test. Paired t-tests were used for analysis of offtake and production at paired sites. Results Population Estimate s and Population Range of Bighorn Sheep Our aerial helicopter surveys suggested a possible increase in the bighorn sheep population over the 3-year study period, shown in Table 1, although confidence intervals were very wide. Bighorn sheep ranged from locations just north of Horseshoe Bend in the south, to West Pryor in the west, to just south of Dry Head Creek at the north end of the park, to the Lake on the east end of the park (Figure 1). In 3 years of monitoring, we did not observe any collared sheep east of Bighorn Lake (Figure 1). Bighorns were observed in summer 2002 in the lakebed, when Bighorn Lake was closed to boating and human activities due to lack of water, and forage-filled sandbars lined the Lake bottom. We calculated 39 rams:100 ewes in 2000, 58 rams:100 ewes in 2001, and 69 rams:100 ewes in 2002 from ground and fixed-wing aerial surveys. Population Range of Wild Horses The wild horse population is contained with a combination of natural geographic boundaries and fences. At the northern end the range extended to a BLM fenceline along Layout Creek, to Bighorn Lake in the east, to the mouth of Crooked Creek and a fenceline at the south end of the range, and along Crooke d Creek Canyon at the west end of the range. The wild horses inhabited areas on BLM, NPS and USFS lands. Bighorn Sheep Survivorship and Predation had 13 radio-collared bighorn sheep die during our 3-year study. Of those, 4 died as mountain lion kills, 1 died from black bear kill, 1 died of coyote kill (a lthough this ewe had a broken leg for 5 months prior to being depredated), 1 died from illness or disease, 3 died from unknown causes or presumed old age, and 3 died from capture myopathy. None of the bighorn sheep mortalities were found in Big Coulee or Crooked Creek (Figure 4). Forty-six percent were located on the Dry Head (including Layout Creek and behind Sorenson Ranch) and 54% were north of the horse range. The majority (77%) of mort alities occurred in winter months (Oct, Nov, Dec, Jan, Feb, Mar), with only 33% occurring in summer months. Of the 11 sheep remains and skulls found in the field, 5 were determined as \"depredated\" and 6 were \"unknown.\" 15 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Table 1 .

Pregnancy of Ewes Average pregnancy rate \u00b1 s.e.) for ewes was \u00b1 4% ( 4 years). Average lambing rate was 68 \u00b1 5% over 3 years. We defined neonatal loss as ewes that were observed pregnant (with extended teats) and tested pregnant in pregnancy tests, but were not seen 3-4 weeks after presumed lambing to have a lamb at their side. We calculated neonatal and/or in-utero loss ( \u00b1 s.e.) to Lambing locations of radio-collared bighorn ewes in BICA are shown in Figure 5. Sex ratios of lambs were 1 male to 1.3 females in 2001 and also in 2002 (Table 2), although this is based on a small sample size ( n = 7 lambs/year). Lamb Survivorship Twenty-one percent of lambs of collared ewes born in 2001 (3 of 14) survived to 1 year old and 44% born in 2002 survived to 1 year old (7 of 16). Lambs that did not survive lived an average of 108 \u00b1 22 days (123 \u00b1 34 days from June 2001- June 2002 and 89 \u00b1 24 days from June 2002- June 2003). Winter Body Conditi on of Bighorn Sheep Necropsies conducted at the Wyoming State Veterinary Lab in Laramie, Wyoming on bighorn sheep mortalities indicated that none of the sh eep that died were in poor body condition, but several had healed fractured tibias or other fractures that likely predisposed them to predation. Chest girth measurem ents indicated that BICA 16 Figure .

When we compared winter body weights of Bighorn Canyon sheep to the wild herd in Canada (Jorgenson and Wishart, 1984), we found that body weights of Bighorn Canyon sheep were significantly lower (by an average of 10.2 kg \u00b1 2.0; P = 0.0042). Bighorn Canyon sheep also had lower body weights than captive Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep (Woolf, 1971) by an average of 18 \u00b1 4 kg (P = 0.0050). Presence of Disease In 2000, samples reveal ed the presence of Pasteurella in tonsil swabs taken from captured animals. However, at that time the Wyoming State Veterinary Lab was not able to discern between the toxic Pasteurella bacteria and the non-toxic Pasteurella bacteria, thus we do not know if toxic or passive Pasteurella bacteria infected the herd (Walt Cook, Wyoming State Vet Lab, oral commun., 2001). Once the lab had the capabilities (Pasteurella was renamed Mannheimia ) in 2001, we were able to discern more meaningful results. In 2001 we found evidence of a toxic Pasteurella bacteria, Mannheimia haemolytica in 42% of the sheep sampled. Thirty-two percent of the sheep had evidence of P. trehalosi (non-toxic Pasteurella bacteria ), and 26% had no significant bacteria isolated. In addition, a domestic ewe was found roaming the park in summer 2002 on the bighorn sheep range on the Dry Head. Contact with wild bighorn sheep was not witnessed, but the domestic ewe was in the park for 10 days during which time contact could have occurred. USGS researchers subsequently observed coughing lambs, monitored them, and two of these lambs died. No evidence of ear mites or bluetongue was found either year. Parasites found in feces included Nematodirus (ranging from 2-18 Protostrongylus ) were found in fecal samples in both 2000 and 2001, ranging from 2-489 larvae/gram feces in 2000. In 2001, one animal had 120 larva/gram feces, while the majority (90%) had 15 larva/gram feces. Eighty-two percent (82%) of the bighorn sheep sampled had been exposed to para influenza and had high concentrations of antibodies in their blood. Competition Between Wild Horses and Bighorn Sheep Our analysis of lambing rates, lamb survivorship, and pregnancy rates on versus off the wild horse range showed little evidence of competition (see analysis in Popu lation Demography and Modeling section of this report). We found no differences between bighorn sheep inhabiting ar eas on versus off the wild horse range for any of these population variables. Habitat Characteristics When we compared bighorn sheep ha bitat characteristics on versus of f the wild horse range, we found differences in shrub density, total live plant cover, live grass cover, cactus cover, and dead c over. Density of mountain mahogany was higher on versus off the horse range ( P = 0.0146). There were no differences in density of other shrubs on versus off the horse range. Live plant ground cover was significantly lower on the horse range ( P = 0.0024; 13.25 \u00b1 0.98 %) compared to off horse range sites (18.09 \u00b1 1.25%). The horse range sites also had 77% less cactus cover ( P = 0.0070), 32% less dead plant cover ( P = 0.0341), and 38% less live grass cover ( P = 0.0041) than sites off the horse range. 19 -- -- We found differences in habitat features between the 4 study areas (Table 3). Barry's Landing sites had 18% lower visibility than Dry Head and Crooked Creek sites (P = 0.0223), but also higher dead plant cover, live grass cover, cactus cover, and total groundcover than all other sites (Table 3). Big Coulee had the lowest live cover of all the sites ( P = 0.0004; Table 3). Because visib ility is such an important habita t feature for bighorn sheep, we specifically compared visibility in key vegetation types at Barry's Landing versus the Dry Head to see if the same vegetation type had the same horizontal visibility in both places. We found that visibility was consistently higher on the Dry Head than at Barry's Landing in all vegetation types ( P = 0.0625; Figure 6). We calculated amount of bighorn sheep habitat in the 4 study areas by vegetation type using \"suitable,\" plus \"acceptable,\" plus \"margi nal\" habitat from the Animal Location-based model (see Habitat Modeling section of this report; Figures 7 and 8). The Dry Head and Barry's Landing had higher amounts of mountain mahogany/juniper and juniper woodland habitat than Crooked Creek and Big Coulee. The Dry Head had less sage and less grassland habitat than all the other areas (Figures 7 and 8). Table 3 .

Rates of Forage Consumption by Ungulates We found differences in percent offtake between paired sites in summ er (Table 4), but not in winter (Table 5). Offtake at sites within the horse range boundary at Booz Canyon (Dry Head) were 3x higher than Hillsboro (Barry's Landing) over 3 years. Slopes in Big Coulee near the old Washout Road had higher offtake than similar slopes in Crooked Creek (Table 4). The Barry's Island area had higher offtake in summer than the Peninsula area (Dry Head). However, overall we found no difference in offtake on versus off the wild horse range (Tables 4 and 5) in either summer or wint er. Ungulate consumption across th e entire study area averaged 15.0 \u00b1 6.3% in summer, and 30.2 \u00b1 5.9% in winter. Herbaceous Production Overall plant production was significantly lower on th e horse range, compared to off the wild horse range (P = 0.0184; Table 6). Barry's Island Ar ea sites (off horse range) had higher he rbaceous production th an sites on the Peninsula (on horse range), and Hillsboro (off horse range) had higher production than Booz Canyon sites (off horse range; Table 6). 22 Table 4 .

We also found a correlation between summer plus winter offtake and the next summer's production (P = 0.0795; r2= 0.0877; Figure 9), where higher summer plus winter offtake decreased the next year's herbaceous production. We also found that higher u ngulate offtake in June negatively affected production in September ( P = 0.0227; r2= 0.0836; Figure 9), but winter offtake did not appear to greatly affect the next summer's herbaceous production ( P = 0.1321). Nutritional Analysis of Vegetation We found the greatest differences in nutrient concentrations in bluebunch wheatgrass and needle and thread grass between the 4 study areas. Where th ere were differences in forage nutrie nt concentration, the Dry Head site had higher concentrations of beneficial nutrients and digestibility than some other sites, as well as higher concentrations of indigestible, fibrou s material (lignin, Adf, cellulose). Nitrogen Nitrogen concentrations were higher at the Dry Head sites than Barry's Landing and Crooked Creek sites in blue grama and bluebunch wheatgrass in summer. The Dry Head sites also had higher N concentrations than Crooked Creek in needle and thread grass in both winter and summer (Tables 7 and 8). 24 September Production (t) Summer Production (t+1) Summer Production (t+1) 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 (a) P = 0.0484 R2 = 0.1098 -30 -10 10 30 50 70 S u m m e r Offta ke (t) 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 (b) P = 0.0795 R2 = 0.0877 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 T o ta l O ffta ke (t) 175 150 125 100 75 50 25 0 -100 -80 -60 -40 -20 0 20 40 60 80 100 (c) P = 0.0227 R2 = 0.0836 Jun e O ffta ke (t) Figure 9 .

Dry Head concentr ations were also higher than Crooked Creek in winter in both bluebunch wheatgrass and needle and thread grass (Tables 7 and 8). Dry Matter Digestibility Dry Head sites had higher dry matter digestibility concentrations than some of the other sites, in both summer and winter, particularly in bluebunch wheatgrass, needle and thread grass, and blue grama (Tables 7 and 8). Acid Detergent Fiber Concentrations of acid detergent fiber (Adf) were not consistent by site or season. In summer, Adf was higher at Barry's Landing than Dry Head and Crooked Creek sites in bluebunch wheatgrass. The three other sites were higher than Crooked Creek in Adf concentration in blue grama in summer. Only needle and thread grass showed differences in Adf concentrations in winter, where Big Coulee and Crooked Creek had higher concentrations than Dry He ad sites (Tables 7 and 8). Lignin The Dry Head and Big Coulee sites had higher lignin content in summer than Crooked Creek in bluebunch wheatgrass. The Dry Head was also higher than Barry's Landing in lignin content in winter for blue gramma (Tables 7 and 8). Protein There were no differences in summer protein concentra tion of any plants between study areas. Only needle and thread grass showed differences in winter, with the Dry Head and Barry's Landing sites having higher protein concentrations than the Crooke d Creek site (Tables 7 and 8). Cellulose We found differences in cellulose in both summer and winter (Tables 7 and 8). In summer, cellulose concentration was higher at Dry Head and Barry's Landing sites in bluebunch wheatgrass than Crooked Creek and Barry's Landing sites, and higher at Big Coulee than the Barry's Landing site in mountain mahogany. In winter, concentrations of cellulose were higher at Big Coulee than other sites in mountain mahogany and needle and thread grass, and lower than other sites in bluebunch wheatgrass (Tables 7 and 8). Selenium We found higher summer selenium levels in mountain mahogany at the Barry's Landing sites than at Dry Head and Crooked Creek sites ( P = 0.0298; Table 7). No other plants had differences in selenium levels in summer or winter, nor on versus off the horse range (Tables 7 and 8) with the exception of summer 2002 in which bluebunch wheatgrass had higher selenium concentrations at the Dry Head than Big Coulee and Barry's Landing sites (P = 0.0900). Selenium levels of all plants sampled are presented in Tables 7 and 8. Selenium levels in soils varied greatly between vege tation types (Table 9) and between habitat areas for bighorn sheep (Table 10). Juniper vegetation type had the highest total available selenium in the soil (44.55 ppb; P = 0.0064; Table 9) and mixed shrub vegetation type had the lowest (5.666 ppb). Big Coulee and Crooked Creek consistently had higher levels of selenium in the soil compared to the Dry Head and Barry's Landing areas (Table 10). 28 Table 9 .

Different letters indicate significant differences at the P<0.05 level. Study Area Soil Nutrient Big Coulee Crooked were significa ntly different during diffe rent months of the year (Table 11; P= <0.0001), with the highest levels in June and September and the lowest levels from November to January. There were no differences in selenium levels be tween age and sex classes (rams versus ewes versus lambs), but fecal-N in bighorn sheep feces was higher in ra ms than ewes, and higher in rams than lambs ( P= 0.0021; Table 12). There was no difference in f ecal-N concentration between lambs and ewes. Other Trace Elements Blood collected from bighorn sheep at the time of captur e revealed no deficiencies in iron. In 35% of the bighorn sheep we sampled, iron levels were above the normal range reported for domestic sheep and other wild bighorn sheep populations in Wyoming. Zinc was found to be sufficient and even slightly high, ranging from 1.0 to 2.3 parts per million (ppm) over 2 years, as normal range fo r healthy bighorns is 0.8-2.0 ppm. Selenium levels in blood were within the normal range (0.12-1.00 ppm) for healthy sheep, but consistently on the low end of the range (avg. = 0.33; all 0.42; n = 22). Manganese ranged from 0.003- 0.005 ppm (2001 data only), and molybdenum was not detected in either year, indicati ng it was less than the 0.5 ppm detection limit for the Wyoming State Veterinary Lab. Copper concentrations ranged from 0.58- 1.20 ppm, mostly within the normal range for healthy sheep which is 0.60- 1.20 ppm. Discussion The bighorn sheep population of the Pryor Mountains a nd Bighorn Canyon, as well as the ram segment of the herd, appears to be increasing. The population modeling supported our field observations of a greater number of rams in the herd in recent years. Lamb survivorship was 23% higher in 2002 than 2001, but we don't know if this trend will continue. It may be a function of the closure of Bighorn Lake in 2002. The lake was closed due to low water level/drought, and bighorn sheep were observed from late June through fall on sandbars on the lake bottom, foraging on green grass and forbs. Animals were protected in 2002 from human disturbance from boats and jet skis, and from larger predators (b ears, mountain lions) that cannot scale the cliff walls to reach the lake bottom. Data from 2003 will reveal more information on lamb survivorship, as the lake will be opened again for the 2003 boating season and the sheep will not have the same access to rich forage on the lake bottom, nor protection from predators via the tall, steep canyon walls. Bighorn sheep do not appear to be under extreme pressure from predation. Of the total number of mortalities of radio-collared animals each year, predation was responsible for only 1 bighorn death in 2000, 2 deaths in 2001, and 2 deaths in 2002, but sample sizes were very small each year ( n = 5, 3, and 4 total deaths, respectively). At the time this report was written, there was 1 radio-collared bighorn sheep death in 2003, a mountain lion kill in February 2003. There may be an indi vidual mountain lion that has learned ho w to hunt the Sykes Face (normally considered escape terrain) and is selecting bighorn sheep. Several mountain lion kills of radio-collared bighorn sheep were concentrated on the northe rn 1/3 of the Sykes Face -- behind So renson Ranch (Figure 6) in Layout Canyon. Several uncollared ram carcasses were also found in the same area. In a Yellowstone National Park study, bighorn represented < 5% of mountain lion kills (Murphy and others, 1997). If mountain lion predation on bighorn sheep is high, it is likely only one or two individual lions have learned how to hunt sheep (Ross and others, 1997). Disease is evident in the herd and was likely the cause of the decline in 1995-1996, based on Pasteurella titers found in blood samples as well as the high number of sheep of all ages (82%) that had been exposed to para influenza. In addition, the decline followed a pattern of a disease epizootic, with chronic low lamb survival for several years (Foreyt, 1990). Nutritiona lly, bighorn sheep were no t found to have deficiencies in trace elements, although iron levels were elevated (a s high as 6.3 ppm in some cases). No other deficiencies were found in trace elements, although selenium was consis tently on the low end of the acceptab le/healthy range for bighorn sheep in blood samples, feces, soil samples, and in bighorn sheep forages across the range. In another bighorn sheep herd in Wyoming where selenium deficiency was linked to low lamb survivorship, total selenium levels in soil were 0.339 ppm, 0.13 ppm in blood samples of bighorn sheep, and 0.005 ppm in forages where white muscle disease was reported. The selenium levels of these same variables in the BICA range were higher than in the Hnilicka and others (2 001) study, but we do not know what effect potentially 30 Table 11.

Different letters indicate significant differences at the P<0.05 level. Bighorn Sheep Class (as opposed to \"deficient\" levels) of selenium may have on lamb or adult survivorship. White muscle disease was not observed in the BICA herd. Ho wever, low selenium levels may reduce immunity of individual bighorn sheep, especially if coupled with other population pressures or stressors. Deficiencies in selenium cause decreased immune response in bighorn sheep and may make sheep susceptible to disease. Animals that are stressed (from human disturbance, extreme predation pressu re, a combination of these, or other causes) are also more susceptible to disease than bighorn sheep that are not stressed (Kraabel and Miller, 1997). Both chest girth measurements and body weights of bighorn sheep were smaller in BICA than a herd in Alberta, Canada, but this may be due to climate and elevation differences. Also, we had a small sample size (n = 6 animals) for body weights, and we had 16 chest girth m easurements. Since body weight and chest girth size are correlated (Mayaka and others, 1995), it was not surprising that if one body measurement variable was smaller, the other variable was also smaller. In general, necropsies did not indicate that bighorn sheep in BICA were in poor body condition. Body mass is correlated with survival in both adults and lambs (Festa-Bianchet and others, 1997), and since we were not able to compare BICA sheep to any other herds in Wyoming or Montana, we do not know if smaller body mass could be associat ed with declin e of the herd. Information about competition between wild horses and bighorn sheep was somewhat conflicting. On one hand, we did not find compelling evidence in parameters of fecundity, survival, or forage use to support a theory of resource competition between bighorn sheep and wild horses, comparing n = 12 ewes on horse range vs. n = 10 ewes off horse range. Pregnancy, lambing, and lamb survivorship were almost identical on versus off the wild horse range, although sample sizes there were even smaller. There were no more bighorn sheep mortalities on the horse range than off. Ungulate consumption was higher on the horse range at some but not all of our sites compared to off the horse range, which would be expected with the addition of another large herbivore to the area. However, when we pooled all sites on the horse range and compared them to all areas off the horse range in a paired t-test, we found no differences on versus off in ungulate consumption in either winter or summer, suggesting that the areas shared with wild horses were not grazed more than unshared areas. We did, however, find a significantly lower rate of herbaceous plant production on versus off the wild horse range, and regression analyses showed a significant correlation between offtake and production. That is, offtake levels were high enough to have a negative affect on herbaceous plant production, suggesting that ungulate consumption levels across the range were very high. Similar to our findings of lowered production by ungulate consumption, Fahnestock (1998), Peterson and others (1997), and Gerhardt and Detling (1998) all found lower cover in bluebu nch wheatgrass in grazed plots than exclosed plots on the Dry Head area, and overall grass biomass was higher inside than outside exclosures there. Fahnestock (1998) reported that precipitation had a greater affect than herbivory on overall vegetation dynamics on the PMWHR, and herbivory had greater effects on grasses in the lowland, arid sites (the Dry Head area) than on other plant groups. Absolute cover of grasses in lowland sites was 62% lo wer than in ungrazed sites (Fahnestock, 1998). Plant production was also lower on the low el evation Dry Head compared to higher elevation sites (Fahnestock, 1998). Our results indicated that the current levels of grazing ne gatively affected herbaceous plant production, at least in the Dry Head areas that bighorn sheep use. This result may be aggravated by low precipitation in the past several years. Our analysis of nutrients, offtake, production, an d habitat characteristics re vealed some interesting correlations, which may be driving sheep distribution behavior across the range. We noted at the beginning of the study that there were areas that had been modeled as suitable bighorn sheep habitat by Gudorf and others (1996) that were not being used by bighorns (e.g., Big Coulee). At the same time, surrounding areas were established and 32 inhabited by both rams and at least some ewe groups. Big Coulee is an area with high wild horse densities in winter. We suspect bighorn sheep are not using Big Coulee for a number of reasons. First, modeling has shown that Big Coulee has less suitable bighorn sheep habitat than the other 3 areas (Crooked Creek, Dry Head, and Barry's Landing -- areas they currently use). Lower overall suitable habitat may be deterring ewe groups from establishing in Big Coulee. In addition, the Dry Head area has the most mountain mahogany/juniper woodland habitat, and sheep appear to rely on this type in BICA especially in winter. Second, the Dry Head appears to have higher concentrations of palatable nutrients in summer especially, and the visibility for bighorn sheep is statistically higher -- even within the same vegetation types -- than other area s, due to smaller shrub sizes on the Dry Head. The quality of habitat appears to be better on the Dry Head than other areas. Lower herbaceous production on the Dry Head compared to the Barry's Landing area do es not appear to deter sheep from concentrating there in both summer and winter. Summer plant nitrogen concentrations in 2 preferred grass species for bighorn sheep were higher on the Dry Head than Barry's Landing area. Summe r Adf (fiber) content was lower on the Dry Head, suggesting that plant quality may be higher on the Dry Head than Barry's Landing area. The combination of these factors (more suitable habitat overall, higher concentrations of palatable nutrients, greater horizontal visibility for sheep, and more mountain mahogany habitat) may explain why bighorn sheep appear to concentrate on the Dry Head in both winter and summer, and are not using other accessible areas of the ra nge that have been modeled as suitable sheep habitat. We recommend further investigations into the spatia l dynamics of bighorn sheep across the landscape, and more detailed analysis of habitat for habitat improvem ents. Specifically, we recommend thinning and burning treatments to improve visibility in habitat that has lower visibility but all other habitat requirements for bighorn sheep are present, such as the Barry's Landing area. We recommend continuing to monitor radio-collared animals, and adding collars to bighorn ewes that have established in Crooked Creek and areas north of Barry's Landing. These are the animals of particular interest, as they appear to be moving into new habitats and expanding the bighorn range. We do not recommend any habitat treatments in Big Coulee at this time, until more is known about the habitat. According to our habitat modeling (see Habitat Modeling section of this report), Wockner and others determined that there is less habitat for bighorns in Big Co ulee than in other areas of the range. This area should be studied further to determine possibilities for habitat improvement to increase the size of the useable bighorn sheep range. We recommend supplementing the herd with selenium blocks because selenium levels in plants and blood samples were on the low end of the accepta ble range. Also, selenium levels in soil were lowest in the areas where bighorn sheep concentrate in both summer and winter - the Dry Head area. Supplementing the herd with selenium blocks may help increase the survivorship of lambs by bolstering bighorn sheep immune systems.

Roelle, U.S. Geological Survey 37 Statement of the Proble m and Study Objectives In order to evaluate the decline of the bighorn sheep population and herd population dynamics in Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area (BICA), I conducted a population analysis using the population modeling programs POP-II and POP-III (Fossil Creek Software, Fort Collins, CO). In addition, I analyzed data on bighorn sheep lambing rates and pregnancy rates. The objectives of the analyses were to: (1) summarize available data on survival, reproduction, and harvest; (2) assess possible effects of sharing range with wild horses on ewe survival, lambing, and pregnancy rates; (3) evaluate the internal consistency of the various demographic data by combining them in a population model; and (4) assess the probable effe cts of various harvest levels on herd size and structure given the best estimates of other population parameters. Methods Adult Survival Data for analysis of adult survival are available from the known history of animals radio-collared in February 2000 and January 2001 (Table 1). The three animals th at died within about one week of the first capture in 2000 (presumably as a result of handling stress) were elimin ated from the analysis. No an imals died after the second capture in 2001. Many ewes can be classified as either on or off the horse range, but some use habitat in both areas. Rams tend to travel larger distances and cannot be so cl assified. Comparisons were made of ewes on versus off the wild horse range to evaluate possible effects of sharing range with wild horses. The years of the study were considered normal-dry years for precipitation, with the exception of 2002, which was a drought year. Annual survival rates and confidence limits were calculated using the Known Fate module, which is appropriate when the fate of every individual is known, in Program MARK (White and Burnham, 1999). Survival rates were modeled with parameters representing year, group (sex, location of animals on or off the horse range), and a year by group interaction. Years were loosely defined as February 15, 2000 to January 25, 2001 (year 1), January 26, 2001 to January 25, 2002 (year 2), and January 26, 2002 to January 25, 2003 (year 3). Unfortunately, this definition combines parts of two winters in each year; however, it is consistent with the times at which animals were marked. 38 Table 1 . Fate of animals radio-collared in 2000 and 2001. Dots indicate missing data (e.g., the animal has not yet died or is known to utilize habitat both on and off the horse range). Age at Date Date Cause of Horse Collar # Sex Capture Collared Died Death Range E021 Female 4.5 and Lambing Rates Data available for the analysis of pregnancy and lambin g rates are mostly from ewes radio-collared in this study, with a few observations of ewes originally marked by Kissell (1996) (Table 2). Pregnancy was determined by tests of either blood or feces . To confirm lambing, ewes were directly ob served for both the presence of a lamb and other external signs of maternity. Only ewes age 3 and older were considered , because ewes typically are not bred until the fall after they reach age 2. 39 Table 2.

Pregnancy rates and lambing rates on and off the horse range were compared using Fisher's exact test (Mielke and Berry 2001:259) both for each year individually and for data pooled across all years. While this test is valid even for small sample sizes (such as we have for any single year), it ignores potential problems with multiple comparisons (i.e., individual years) and lack of independence in the samples if the data are pooled (i.e., many of the collared ewes were the same from year to year). In an effort to avoid the problem of lack of independence in the samples, data were also subjected to a permutation analys is for multiple binary responses (Berry and Mielke 2003). This approach examines whet her the pattern of responses (e.g., across multiple years) varies within treatment groups. Sample sizes were large enough for this approach only for 2001 and 2002. The relation between pregnancy rates and lambing rates (all groups pooled within years) was also examined using simple linear regression. Population Simulations Model Structure Population simulations were conducted using POP-II and POP-III (both copyrighted by Fossil Creek Software, Fort Collins, CO), which are discrete-time, diff erence-equation models. POP-II begins simulations with a sex- and age-distributed population, subtracts animals for the current year due to natural mortality and harvest, increments all age classes, calculates a reproductive crop for the next year, and repeats this process for as many years as desired. Model output is in the form of deterministic tables and tim e-traces (graphs) that can be compared with observed data (e.g., population size, age and sex rati os) to calibrate model parameters. POP-III is similar in structure, but model parameters can be specified as statistical distributions (uniform, normal, or cumulative). Multiple Monte Carlo simulations are run by sampling from th ese distributions. Output is in the form of frequency distributions of outcomes in terms of population size and sex ratio. POP-II Details and Basic Assumptions In POP-II, the biological year is divided into three periods as shown in Table 3. Table 3 . The biological year as described for POP-II. Time Period Interpretation for Bighorn Canyon Sheep Population Preseason From immediately post-lambing to start of harvest (approximately June 1 to October 10) Harvest Approximately October 11 to November 20 Postseason From immediately after harvest to immediately before lambing in the following year (approximately November 21 to May 31) The program produces summary populatio n statistics at four times during the biological year: immediately after births, immediately prior to harves t (described as preseason statistics), immediately after harvest (postseason statistics), and immediately prior to births in the next year. Most of the available data on population size, sex ratios, and age ratios for the Bighorn Canyon sheep herd appear to have been gathered in either late fall (November) or late winter (say, March). As a starting point, it was assumed that these data represent the postseason statistics as calculated by POP-II. There are two possible problems with this assumption. First, it is known that some data were 41 gathered prior to the completion of harv est, and are thus not exac tly comparable to the post season statistics produced by POP-II. This is not a serious error, however, because the harvest is small relative to the population size. Second, data gathered in mid-winter represent a herd in which some postseason natural mortality has occurred, whereas POP-II calculates its postseason statistics before any postse ason natural mortality. This is potentially a more serious problem. However, given the available data, there seems to be no solution other than to use data gathered as close to the harvest as possible whenever there is a choice. It was assumed that nearly all natural lamb mortality occurs in the preseason (summer and early fall) and that by the end of harvest, lamb natural mortality rates ar e the same as those for adults . In addition, it was assumed that all natural adult (i.e., non-lamb) mortality occurs in the post season (winter and spring). Initial Population Size The earliest demographic data availa ble for the herd are from Coates and Schemnitz (1989). The population structure for initializing POP-II (Table 4) was taken from their Figure 4, using the midpoint where they reported a range and assuming that lambs and yearlings were evenly distributed between males and females. These data were assumed to represent the population immediately after lambing in 1985. Ewes 2 years of age and older were arbitrarily distributed among age classes 2 through 8. Table 4 . Population structure for initializing POP-II in biological year 1985. Number of Age Class Number of Males Number of Females Age Class Number of Males Females 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 6 2 2 3 3 1 2 2 0 5 2 2 3 2 1 2 2 2 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Total 21 21 Reproduction While there are some data on natality (number of lamb s actually born) for radio-collared ewes in years 2000-2002, most information on reproduction is in the form of age ratios (lambs/100 ewes) obtained in the late fall or winter. These data (Table 5) were used to represent reproduction, and it was assumed that lamb mortality during the preseason period is already accounted for in these ratios. In all cases but on e, the value obtained closest to the time of harvest was used if more than one value was available. However, in 1993-94, the value from Kissell's survey flights (18.0 lambs/100 ewes) was used, even though summer and fall values were available, on the grounds that it was likely to be most consistent with data from la ter years. While this approach effectively obscures one of the most interesting (and probably most variable) aspects of sheep population dynamics (i.e., lambing rates and early lamb survival), it is at least consistent with the available data. Note that because all ew es age 1 and up are included in these ratios, the \"reproductive rate\" is applied to all ew es when used in the simulati on to calculate reproduction. Sex Ratio at Birth It was assumed that the sex ratio of lambs at birth is 1:1 because there are no data to indicate otherwise (McCarty and Miller, 1998). 42 Table 5 . Available age ratio data (lambs/100 ewes). In all cases, it is assumed that an imals age 1 and older are included in the number of ewes. Numbers actually used in POP-II are marked with an asterisk. Source Kissell and others Biological (1996) Survey Kissell and others Idaho Sightability Coates and Year Season or Date Flights (1996) Data Fall 55.6 Winter 18.0* 55.0 Spring 50.5 Winter natural mortality using age-specific rates (%) and annual mortality severity indices, each of which may be specified for both the preseason and postseason periods. The mortality severity indices may be either linear (i.e., a simple multiplier of each age-specific rate) or curvilinear (which affects younger age classes disproportionately). As mentioned above, it was assumed that there is no natural mortality in the preseason period. For the postseason period, the rate (0.90) from the maxi mum likelihood model estimated by Program MARK (based on data from radio-collared animals in 2000-2002) was used . Lambs were also subjected to this same rate in the postseason. For initial simulations, the postseason mortality se verity indices were set to 1.0 (i.e., no effect) for all years. Harvest Data on numbers of animals harvested were provided by S. Stewart, Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks Department (Table 6). It was assumed that all animals taken were Class III and above (age 6 and above). The harvest was also limited (using POP-II's effort values, which are multipliers used to proportion the harvest across age classes) to 4 age classes to try insofar as possible to minimize the number of fractional animals removed, though this probably has no real impact on the simulations. 43 Table 6 . Number of animals (all rams) removed. Biological Year Number Harvested Biological Year Number Harvested 1990-91 2 1997-98 4 Wounding Loss/Illegal Harvest POP-II includes a parameter that can be used to in corporate wounding loss and/or illegal harvest as a proportion of the legal harvest. During the course of the current study, investigators have found no evidence that these factors are significant for the Bighorn Canyon herd (e.g., there have been no unexplained disappearances of known rams) (K. Schoenecker, oral commun., 2003). This parameter was therefore set to zero for all simulations. Observed (Calibration) Data These values represent data points for comparison of the simulated results with field results. Only two types of information are available for this purpose: populati on size (Table 7) and sex ratios (Table 8). In each case, information that corresponded most closely to the time of the postseason calculations in POP-II (i.e., immediately post-harvest) was used. Results Adult Survival Grouping by Location Estimated survival rates for ewes for all combinations of year and group (on or off the horse range) are shown in Table 9. The maximum likelihood model for describing sheep survival (ewes only) on versus off the wild horse range contained only a single parameter (i.e., no effect of year or location; survival = 0.900; 95% C.L. = 0.7813, 0.9578). Based on the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the model incorporating an effect of location was nearly as good (change in AIC from the model without location = 1.73). In this model, the survival estimate for ewes inhabiting areas on the horse range (0.926 ; 95% C.L. = 0.7475, 0.9814) was somewhat higher than that for ewes inhabiting areas off the wild horse range (0.870; 95% C.L. = 0.6645, 0.9573). Note, however, that confidence intervals for these two models overlap and sample sizes are small. Grouping by Sex Estimated survival rates for adult sheep for all combinations of year and sex are shown in Table 10. The maximum likelihood model for describing sheep survival contained only a single parameter (i.e., no effect of year or sex; survival rate = 0.902; 95% C.L. = 0.8207, 0.9477). The next best model (change in AIC from the model excluding sex = 0.90) incorporated an effect of sex. In th is model the estimated survival rate for females was lower (0.875; 95% C.L. = 0.7602, 0.9392) 95% C.L. = 0.7984, 0.9857). Again, however, there is considerable overlap between the c onfidence limits for these two models and sample sizes are sm all, especially for males. Note that Singer and others (2000) also found that rams survived somewhat better than ewes (0.94 vs. 0.89) in unhunted sheep herds recently in troduced into parks in the western United States. Data reported here for the Bighorn Canyon herd are comparable in the sense that harvest mortality is not included. 44 Table 7 . Estimated population size.

The population of 42 animals present in 1985 (Coates and Schemnitz, 1989) grew to a maximum simulated population of about 97 animals in 1992, or less than half of the total population (211) reported by Kissell (1996) for that year (Figure 1A). Simulated sex ratios remained higher than those observed in the field for most of the time period (Figure 1B), though the modeled ratios were close to observed values in 2001 and 2002. Failure of the simulated population to increase to the levels reported by Kissell (1996) in 1992-1993 is somewhat surprising in that reproductive rates used for the period 1985-1992 were relatively high (Table 5) and the calculated survival rates (0.90 for both sexes, or 10% mortality) were essentially the same as those derived by McCarty and Miller (1998) in their review and modeling exercise. In addition, if the Bighorn Canyon population actually grew from 42 animals in 1985 to 211 animals in 1992, the exponential growth rate (r) would have been about 0.23, which is well within the range reported by McCarty and Miller (1998) for introduced sheep populations in Colorado. Thus, while growth of the actual population fr om 42 to 211 animals in 7 years seems plausible, the reproductive and survival rates used in Simulation 1 did not allow growth that rapid in the simulated population. The fact that simulated sex ratios (i.e., more males) we re often higher than those reported from the field is probably not surprising. Rams are often found in rougher topography, making them more difficult to find by ground observers, and tend to be more solitary than females, th us making them more difficult to see from a helicopter. 48 A.

With these reproductive rates, the simulated population gr ew to about 204 animals in 1992 when the postseason natural mortality rates were set to 5% on rams and 4% on ewes (Figure 2A). The slig ht differential in survival between rams and ewes was introduced in an attempt to move the simulated sex ratios toward the reported, but had little effect (Figure 2B). 50 A.

Results of Simulation 2. 51 Simulation 3 The third simulation focused on the same time period and asked a similar question: \"If reproductive rates were as recorded, could the population have grown to 211 animals, and, if so, what natural mortality rates could have been sustained?\" The simulated results shown in Figur e 3 were generated using the reported reproductive rates and postseason natural mortality rates of 1% on rams and 0.8% on ewes. Under these conditions the simulated population grew to 196 animals in 1992 (Figure 3A). Sex ratios, however, remained substantially higher than the reported values (Figure 3B) but not ma rkedly different from Simulation 2. The purpose of Simulations 2 and 3 was simply to demonstrate that the Bighorn Canyon sheep population could have grown as reported under reasonable assumptions about survival and reproduction. Based on these simulations, it appears that such growth could have occurred, but only under very good conditions (i.e., high reproduction and low mortality). It is, of course, impossible to know which set of simulated conditions is closest to what actually occurred. However, given that both produced similar results, it is probably unimportant to make any further distinction. The conditions in Simulation 3 produced results that are plausible and have the advantage of using reported reproductive rates. Simulation 3 was therefore chosen as the basis for continuing the analysis of historical population behavior. 52 A.

Under these conditions, the simulated population grew to about 424 animals in 2002 (about 4 times the reported population size in that year; Figure 4A), and sex ratios remained higher than reported throughout the simulation (Figure 4B). Thus, it seems clear that the lower reproductive rates reported for the mid- and late 1990s (Table 5) could not by themselves have cau sed the reported population d ecline that occurred between 1993 and 1997. 54 A.

Results of Simulation 4. 55 Simulation 5 Annual mortality rates for 1993-2002 were then adjusted (using the Mortality Severity Index parameter in POP-II) to produce the behavior shown in Figure 5. In order to replicate the reported population decline, mortality rates were set at 30% for rams and 24% for ewes from 1993 to 1995 (Figure 5A). Similarly, mortality rates of 10% on rams and 8% on ewes from 1996 to 2002 produced a relatively stable population for the remainder of the simulation. Note that these rates for 1996 to 2002 are essen tially the same as the survival rate calculated for all years (2000-2002) and both sexes in Table 10 (90%). Note also that the introduced disparity in natural mortality between rams and ewes, in combination with harvest of 4 rams pe r year from 1994 to 1997 (Table 6), reduced the simulated sex ratio to between 50 and 60 rams/100 ewes toward the end of the simulation (Figure 5B). 56 A.

Results of Simulation 5. 57 Simulations 6-9 The population parameters used in Simulation 5 produced plausible behavior as judged by comparisons with reported population sizes and sex ratios and were therefore used as the basis for exploring various future (15\u00ad year) scenarios (Table 12). Natural mortality rates were maintained at the values used in Simulation 5 because they produce reasonable population behavior, are similar to the rates calculated for radio-collared animals in this study, and are comparable to rates reported elsewhere in the literature. Reproductiv e rates were chosen to represent the mid-range of those reported for the Bighorn Canyon herd, and harvest levels were selected to be representative of actual harvests in recent years.

In the final year of the simulation, there were about 16 rams in age class 6 or above (data not shown). Note that a reproductive rate of 25 lambs/100 ewes has been achieved or exceeded historically in about 55% of the years for which there are reported data (see Figure 10). With this same reproductive rate and a harvest of 4 ad ult rams per year, the population stabilized at about 100 animals (Figure 7A). The sex ratio declined slowly throughout the simulation to about 45 rams/100 ewes in the final year (Figure 7B). In this case, however, the oldest rams (4) in the final year were in age class 6. With an assumed reproductive rate of 30 lambs/100 ewes (historically achi eved or exceeded about 50% of the time; see Figure 10) and a harvest of 2 rams/year, the population grew slowly to about 175 animals in the fina l year (Figure 8A), and the sex ratio stabilized at about 73 rams/100 ewes (Figure 8B). In the final year of Simulation 8, there were 22 rams in age class 6 or older. Increasing the harvest to 4 rams/year (with a reproductive rate of 30 lambs/100 ewes) resulted in a smaller ending population in Simulation 9 (Figure 9A) and a sex ratio of about 58 rams/100 ewes (Figure 9B). In the final year of Simulation 9, the oldest rams were in age class 9, and there were about 11 rams in age class 6 or older. 58 A.

Results of Simulation 9. 62 2017 17 Monte Carlo Simulations Deterministic simulations of populations as small as the Bighorn Canyon sheep herd must be interpreted with care. Consider two hypothetical populations, one with 10 animals and one with 1,000, each having an annual survival rate of 90%. In either herd, each animal has a 10% chance of dying in a particul ar year. If there are only 10 animals, the probability of the entire herd dying in a given year is (0.1)10, whereas the probability of all 1,000 animals dying in the larger herd is (0.1)1000. Thus, uncertainty, which is ignored in deterministic simulations, is inherently of greater concern when dealing with small populations. Monte Carlo (stochastic) models such as POP-III are one method for attempting to quantify such uncertainty. The basic structure of POP-III is similar to that of POP-II. Simulations begin with an initial population, subtract animals due to natural mortality and harvest, add animals due to reproduction, and repeat the process for a specified number of years. However, POP-III differs in seve ral ways. First, it has a simpler representation of the age and sex structure of the population, using only subadults (young of the year, which are assumed to be distributed equally between the sexes), adult males, and adult females. Second, harvest is specified as a rate, rather than a number of animals to be harvested (or conversely, a number to be left in the population). And third, in POP-III model parameters are specified as statis tical distributions (normal, uniform, or cumulative) rather than deterministic (fixed) values, although fixed values can also be used by specifying only a single value for the uniform distribution. These distributions are then sampled to provide the exact values used in any iteration. Multiple runs produce output in the form of frequency distributions of resulting population sizes and sex ratios. POP-III was used to simulate the behavior of the Bighorn Canyon sheep herd using the parameter values and distributions shown in Table 13. As in the POP-II simu lations, all natural mortality was assumed to occur in the postharvest period. All preharvest survival rates were therefore set to 100%. Harvest was limited to adult males at a rate of 5% (or 95% survival). In a population of about 120 animals, with a sex ratio of 60 rams/100 ewes and an age ratio of 50 lambs/100 ewes, a 5% harvest removes approximately 2 adult males annually. Postseason mortality rates (assumed to be equal for all age and sex classes) were sp ecified as a normal distributi on with mean and standard deviation calculated from the annual rates (only 3 years) estimated in Program MARK. Reproduction was specified as a cumulative frequency distribution (Figure 10) derived from the annual values used in POP-II (Table 5). Finally, a fixed initial age and sex structure was taken from Simulation 5 (above) at the end of 2002. Ten sets of 100 trials were run under these conditions, w ith each trial lasting 15 years. Table 13. Population parameters used in Monte Carlo simulations.

Minimum and maximum population sizes achieved were 51 and 569. Sex ratios at the end of the trials ranged from 43 to 93 rams/100 ewes and were 70 rams/100 ewes in 50% of the cases. 63 Lambing Rates - Probability of Exceedence 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Fitted Lambs / 100 Ewes Observed 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Probability of Exceedence Figure 10.

Results of Monte Carlo simulations. 65 Conclusions and Caveats 1. Based on data from radio-collared animals, annual survival of adult animals was about 90% from February 2000 to January 2003. There is no evidence from these data of differential survival between rams and ewes or between ewes inhabiting on versus off the wild horse range. Sample sizes are small, however. 2. Despite the fact that there is no apparent difference in natural mortality between rams and ewes, sex ratios observed in the field are consistently less than 100 rams /100 ewes, and simulations in dicate that the historical ram harvest ( 4 animals annually) is probably not sufficient to account for these reduced sex ratios. It therefore appears that either: a) sex ratios observed in the field ar e inaccurate (i.e., rams are being missed in the counts); b) fewer male lambs are born than females (although th ere appears to be no eviden ce for this in the Bighorn Canyon herd or others [McCarty and M iller, 1998]); or c) rams in fact suffer higher natural mortality than ewes, but this is not yet reflected in the small sample of radio-collared animals. Note , however, that sex ratios observed in the field in 2001 and 2002 are close to simulated values. 3. Continued monitoring of existing radio-collared animals would be useful in further examining potential differential mortality in ewes residing on versus off the wild horse range and between rams and ewes. Radio- collaring additional animals to increase sample size would also be highly desirable. 4. From 2000 through 2002, the pregnancy rate of adult ewes was 73% and the lambing rate was 72%. Based on data from these three years, there is no evidence of differential pregnancy or lambing rates between years or between ewes residing on versus off the wild horse range. 5. Coates and Schemnitz (1989) reported a population of about 42 animals in 1985, and Kissell (1996) reported about 211 animals in 1992. The exponential growth rate implied by these two numbers (r = 0.23) is within the range reported by McCarty and Miller (1998) for introduced herds in Colorado; however, to achieve growth at this rate, reproduction must be quite high and mortality quite low. 6. The population decline reported by Kissell (1996) between 1993 and 1995 or 1996 cannot be accounted for by the observed decrease in reproduction or the known harvest. Natural mortality must have increased during this period if the population dec lined as much as reported. 7. In simulations, the period of relative population stability between 1996 and 2002 is consistent with reported reproductive rates and fitted natural mortality rates of about 10% on rams and 8% on ewes. These values are also very similar to mortality rates reported for radio-collared animals from 2000 to 2003. 8. Based on 15-year modeling projections, assuming annual natural mortality rates of 10% on rams and 8% on ewes and reproduction of 25 lambs/100 ewes (as measured in postseason counts --postseason age ratios of 25 lambs/100 ewes have been recorded in about 55% of the years since 1985), the population should be able to support a harvest of 2 rams/year, as long as the population remains stable (i.e., mortality does not increase and reproductive rates do not decrease). W ith a harvest of 4 rams/year, however, legal rams (age class 6 and above) are eliminated from the population by the end of 15 years. If resource management goals include increasing the size of the herd, then a more conserva tive harvest (< 2) is appropriate. 9. Similar projections show that reproduction must be at a le vel of at least 30 lambs/100 ewes (again, as measured in postseason counts) to support an annual harvest of 4 rams from age class 6 and above. Postseason age ratios of 30 lambs/100 ewes were recorded in about 50% of the years since 1985. 10. Deterministic simulation modeling of populations as small as the Bighorn Canyon sheep herd must be interpreted carefully, because deviati ons from average conditions in the field can have more drastic impacts than on larger populations. However, Monte Carlo simulations, which attempt to incorporate the effects of such deviations by using parameter distributions derived from historical data, resulted in a population 128 animals in about 80% of the trials when the harvest rate was set at 5%. 11. Nothing in the data analyses or simulations described above addresses the question of genetic viability of the herd, whatever its size. 12. The simulations described above all assume that reproductive rates are not limited by the number of breeding males in the population. 13. The simulations also do not directly address the question of whether higher harvest rates on older rams may depress survivorship in younger rams as suggested by Singer and Zeigenfuss (2002). 66 Literature Cited Berry, K.J., and Mielke, Jr., P.W., Jr., 2003, Permutation analysis of data with multiple binary category choices: Psychologica l Reports, no. 92, p. 91-98.

Vegetation Studies 69 70Vegetation Monitoring of the Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Range and Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area, Montana and Wyoming, 2002 By Troy Gerhardt, Fort Collins, Colorado 71 72Summary A network of large permanent exclosures was established in the Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Range (PMWHR) and Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area (BICA) from 1992 to 1994 to monitor the effects of large herbivore grazing and management practices on vegetation. Sampling was conducted at exclosure sites from 1992- 1996. The current project was initiated to continue monitoring vegetation at established exclosure sites, providing data for management decisions and input for system models. This report describes results of the 2002 sampling effort and reviews relevant findings from a series of previous studies. Sampling methods and analyses were based on those used in previous PMWHR studies to provide continuity and were designed to compare vegetation inside and outside permanent exclosures 10 years after the current series of monitoring began. The objectives of this study were to: (1 ) measure herbaceous biomass; (2) estimate plant cover and determine richness; (3) measure shrub ( Cercocarpus ledifolius ) production; (4) map cushion plants; and (5) document vegetation inside and outside of permanent exclosures at all sites with photographs. Herbaceous biomass, species richness, and species cover were estimated insi de and outside exclosures at all 12 sites. Biomass was estimated by clipping aboveground biomass in five plots inside and outside exclosures. Plant cover and species richness were estimated by species in 10 Daubenmire plots inside and outside each exclosure. Shrub production was estimated at the two sites where curlleaf mountain mahogany ( C. ledifolius ) is a dominant species. Cushion plant mapping was conducted at four sites including two inside the PMWHR and BICA, and two inside BICA but not within the PMWHR boundaries. Averaged across sites, biomass differe nces inside and outside of permanen t exclosures were significant for all variables tested: total herbaceous biom ass, live grass, current year's dead grass, old dead gr ass, and forbs (all P <0.001). Total biomass and grass biomass (live and dead) were significantly higher inside exclosures, while forb biomass was lower inside exclosures. Although these results we re relatively consistent across sites, the interaction between site and exclosures was also significant, indicating that the effects of grazing were not distributed evenly across the landscape. Of the 16 cover variables analyzed, five were sign ificantly different inside and outside of permanent exclosures. Grazing effects were detected for total plant cover, litter cover, and absolute and relative grass cover which were all significantly lower in the grazed plots outside of the exclosures. Bare ground showed an opposite trend and was higher in grazed plots. Sp ecies richness was slightly but significantly greater in plots protected from grazing. Production of a broad-leaved evergreen shrub ( C. ledifolius) was similar inside and outside exclosures at two sites. Shrub production was lower than during previous years. Cushion plant frequency/cover was determined by mapping at four sites. At the sites inside the PMWHR (North and South Dryhead) frequency of all four cushion plant species in mapped grids was similar inside and outside permanent exclosures. There is no evidence that horse grazing is af fecting cushion plan t frequency/cover based on sampling inside and outside permanent exclosures. Historical cattle trailing occurred at the other two sites in BICA (North and South Lockhart Ranch). No differences were found between grazed/trampled and exclosed plots, however nearby \"native\" plots not subjected to ca ttle trampling show significan tly different cover/frequency for some species. Trails are still clearly visible inside the exclosures, suggesting that these communities recover relatively slowly when trampled to bare ground. At the time of sampling in July 2003, regional precipitation had been below the long-term average for several years. The 10-year trend in vegetation dynamics at the exclosure sites in the PMWHR and BICA is generally for lower mean biomass both inside and outside the exclosures. To explore the relationships between grazing effects, precipitation, and horse populations, several correlations and regressions were done on previous and current data. Grazing effects were calculated as a pe rcent difference inside and outside permanent exclosures ([biomass inside- biomass outside]/biomass inside). Percent biomass difference tended to increase with both current and past year's horse population and decrease with incr easing precipitation although regressions were not significant. Simple correlations between biomass difference and both past horse population and precipitation were nearly significant 73 suggesting that average grazing effects increase as the horse population increas es and decrease in years with higher precipitation. Introduction The Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Range (PMWHR) was established in 1968 and has a long-term management goal of maintaining a \"thriving ecological balance\" (BLM, 19 84). The PMWHR and Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area (BICA) support a population of wild horses of Spanish ancestry and a population of bighorn sheep. The United States Geological Survey and othe r federal and state agencies have funded a series of ecological studies on horse genetics, vegetation dynamics, ungulate diets and habitat use, carrying capacity, and ecosystem modeling in the PMWHR (Kissell, 1996; and summary in Singer and Schoenecker, 2000). A bighorn sheep study in BICA is ongoing. Understanding how ungulate populations affect the PMWHR and BICA vegetation and alter forage and habitat availability is critical for a so und evaluation of management options. B ecause of concern about the effects of wild horses, bighorn sheep, and mule deer on the vegetation of the PMWHR and about the ability of the range to support ungulate populations, vegetation monitoring was initiated in 1992 at five permanent exclosure sites (Peterson and others, 1997). Biomass and plant cover were measured inside and outside of permanent exclosures, and grazing cages were established to measure growing season herbivory. Intensive studies on herbaceous and shrub biomass dynamics and shrub digestibility (Peterson, 1999) and on species composition, plant cover, and resource limitation (Fahnestock, 1998) were completed from 1992-1994. In 1994, nine additional permanent exclosures were established, and vegetation monitoring continued at all ex closure sites through 1996 (Gerhardt and Detling, 1998). Previous studies have reported a variety of vegetation responses to exclosures in the PMWHR and BICA. Analysis of vegetation data collected from 1992-1994 focused on localized and others, 1997; Peterson, 1999). Results from these reports generally indicate detectable herbivory effects at some sites for some vegetation variables, and showed a large inter-annual variation in vegetation with differences in cover and biomass often greater between years than between grazed and ungrazed pl ots. Later analyses included data from the expanded exclosure network and focused on depicting both localized and range-wide effects of herbivory (Gerhardt and Detling, 1998). Results from these data generally agreed with earlier work, detecting more vegetation differences at some sites than at others. Select data from these studies were used to: (1) su mmarize major trends in vegetation dynamics within the PMWHR and BICA (Gerhardt and Detling, 2000); and (2) develop an ecosystem model to assess the impacts of grazing across the landscape and support informed management decisions (Coughenour, 1999, 2000). The summary analyses attempted to detect the spatia l and temporal factors (including the exclosure) most related to vegetation dynamics. Across sites and years, significant effects of grazing were detected for some vegetation variables (grass cover and near significant differences for total herbaceous biomass and litter cover). However, factors related to site location and/or the time of measuremen t explained most of the variability for each vegetation variable (Gerhardt and Detling, 2000). A spatially-explicit ecosystem model incorporating these data was developed by Coughenour (1999, 2000) and used to examine the effect s of alternative scenarios of weathe r, land use, and horse population management. The model realistically represented the PM WHR and BICA grazing syst em and demonstrated the effects of varying climate and ungulate populations on vegetation and other ecosystem properties. Modeling results suggest that the effects of horse grazing will not be dist ributed homogeneously across the landscape and that effects will vary depending on the size of the horse population, weather patterns, and site location. In addition, the model predicted that horse grazing has little effect on bighorn sh eep populations due to spatial and dietary separation and strong intra-specific density dependence. The current project was initiated to continue monitoring vegetation at established exclosure sites, providing data for ungulate management decisions and input for system models. Sampling methods and analyses were based on those used in previous PMWHR studies to provide continuity (Fahnestock, 1998; Gerhardt and Detling, 1998; Peterson and others, 1997; Peterson, 1999) and were designed to compare vegetation inside and outside permanent exclosures 11 years after the current series of monitoring began. 74 The objectives of this study were to: 1. measure herbaceous biomass inside and outside of permanent exclosures at 12 sites, 2. estimate plant cover and determine species richness inside and outs ide permanent exclosures at 12 sites, 3. measure shrub (Cercocarpus ledifolius ) production inside and outside exclosures at two sites, 4. map cushion plants inside and outside permanent exclosures at five sites, and 5. document vegetation inside and outside of permanent exclosures at all sites with photographs. Methods Study Area The PMWHR is located along the border of Montana and Wyoming (Carbon County, MT, Big Horn County, WY), encompassing approximately 18,000 ha of Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Custer National Forest, BICA and state and private lands. Topography an d vegetation are variable, ranging from steep cliffs and rocky canyons to rolling meadows and desert shrublands. Elev ations range from approximately 1150 to 2500 meters, with lower elevations found towards the south, east, and so uthwest. Previous studies classified the vegetation into nine main types (Knight and others, 1987): juniper steppe, grasslands, coniferous riparian, and agricultural. Annual rainfall across the PMWHR vari es from approximately 150 to 500 mm, increasing with elevation. The exclosure sites monitored as part of this study were scattered across the PMWHR (Figure 1). Sites were located in several vegetation comm unities on several soil types. Site elevation spanned the range found in the PMWHR, and mean annual site precipitation ranged from 200 to 510 mm (Table 1). Populations of three herbivores forage solely or seasonally within the PMWHR and were studied by Kissell and others (1996) from 1993 to 1996. The population of mule deer ( Odocoileus hemionus ) in the PMWHR varied annually and seasonally, with winter populations varying from 143 to 780 between 1993 and 1996 (Kissell and others, 1996). Mule deer use of vegetation types varied seasonally: deer used juniper and mountain mahogany vegetation types most in winter and used coniferous woodlands, sagebrush, and juniper during the summer. Deer diets varied seasonally, with browse constituting almost th e entire diet during the winter (98%), and forbs forming an important dietary component during the spring and early summer. One shrub sp ecies, curlleaf mountain mahogany ( Cercocarpus ledifolius ) made up over 66% of the each year (Kissell, 1996). Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis ) were extirpated from the Pryor Mountains around 1860. The current sheep population within PMWHR was founded by sheep from nearby reintroductions during the early 1970's and increased exponentially from a population of six animals (Coates and Schemnitz, 1988, 1989; Kissell and others, 1996). From a peak of 211 animals in 1993/1994, the PMWHR sheep population decreased to 125 in 1996 and has remained low. Sheep mostly use lower elevation (<1,500 m) mountain mahogany and juniper vegetation types year round (Kissell and others, 1996). Sheep diets were dominated by browse (primarily mountain mahogany) during the fall and winter, by grasses in the spring, and by a fairly even mixture of browse and grass during the summer. Forbs consistently represented a minor portion of sheep diets except during the spring when diets were 16% forbs (Kissell and others, 1996). The herd size of horses ( Equus caballus ) is intensively monitored and managed in the PMWHR with gathers and culling every 1-3 years to maintain the population at an Appropriate Management Level (AML) in accordance with the Wild Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act of 1971 an d BLM plans (BLM 1984, 199 7). The horse herd is typically distributed among three distinct but interbreeding subpopulations, particularly during the summer (Singer and others, 2000). Horse diets are dominated by grasses (Kissell, 1996) and grazing is spatially and seasonally variable (Kissell and others, 1996; Coughenour, 2000). 75 Figure 1. PMWHR area map showing location of permanent exclosur e sites. Map was created on 1:24,000-scale USGS quads and is shown at a 1:100,000 scale. Site names are provided. Vegetation sampling was conducted at 12 sites in July 2002 (red markers). Plant cover and herbaceous biomass inside and outside of permanent exclosures were estimated at all sampled sites. Herbaceous biomass inside temporary grazing exclosures was estimated at a ll sites except Turkey Flats. Production of Cercocarpus ledifolius was estimated inside and outside permanent exclosures at Yellow Hill and Bat Cave. Cushion plant mapping was completed at the North and South Dryhead sites and at the North and South Lockhart Ranch sites. Sites shown in blue were not sampled during 2002. 76 Table 1.

Two exclosures located in montane grasslands were established in the 1960's (Stohlgren and others, 1999). Three exclosures were erected in late June of 1992, and vegetation sampling began at these five sites in the summer of 1992 (Peterson and others, 1997; Fahnestock, 1998; Peterson, 1999). The remaining exclosure sites were selected and established in 1994. See Appendix A for site ages and biomass sampling history. Field Methods To allow comparisons with vegetation data collected in earlier studies, methods were based on those used previously in the PMWHR for vegetation monitoring (Fahne stock, 1998; Gerhardt and Detling, 1998; Peterson and others, 1997; Peterson, 1999). Sampling was completed July 8-12, 2002, the approximate time of peak standing crop for herbaceous species. 77 Biomass Peak standing crop of herb aceous material was estimated inside and outside of permanent exclosures at 12 sites (Figure 1; Table 1). Inside permanent exclosures, five sample locations were selected using a random number table, and herbaceous vegetation wa s clipped to ground level inside of a circular quadrat (0.25 m2). Five quadrats outside of the permanent exclosure were placed according to the location of temporary grazing exclosures. Cages were established in April and early May 2002 by USGS personnel. Data from inside temporary cages (used to calculate grazing offtake) is not reported here. Species Composition and Cover Species composition and cover were estimated inside the permanent exclosure and in the control plot of 12 sites (Figure 1). Canopy cover was estimat ed by species in 10 Daubenmire fra mes located every 3 m along the plot diagonal. Shrub Production Production of current annual growth (CAG) was measured on curl-leaf mountain mahogany shrubs at two sites: Bat Cave and Yellow Hill (Figure 1). At each site, production of CAG twigs in side and outside permanent exclosures was estimated for small (< 10 cm tall), medium (> 10 cm and < 40 cm), and large (> 40 cm) shrubs. Ten shrubs in each size class were selected inside and outside of each exclosure. On each shrub, the number of CAG twigs was counted. On larger shrubs, the canopy was visua lly divided into sections. CAG twigs were counted in one randomly selected shrub section and multiplied by the appropriate integer to estimate total CAGs/shrub. Ten CAG twigs were clipped at the bud scale scar and collected to estimate mass/CAG twig. Cushion Plants Cushion plants were mapped at four low elevation sites: North and South Dryhead, and North and South Lockhart Ranch (Figure 1). At each site, cushion plants were mapped inside permanent exclosures and in established control plots. The two northern sites (North and South Lockhart Ranch) were specifically established to monitor dynamics in cushion plant communities subjected to concen trated trampling from trailing cattle during seasonal drives. At these sites an additional \"native\" plot was established in 1994 at some distance from the road. This plot did not contain visible cattle trails and was selected to represent areas not tram pled by cattle. Two sites (North and South Dryhead) were established in 1992 to monitor vegetation dynamics caused primarily horse grazing. \"Permanent\" 1 m x 1 m plots were established at these sites in 1994 and marked with large nails driven to ground level. Most of the sites could not be relocated; those that were located often had corner nails that were no longer square. Cushion plants were mapped using the same method as earlier studies and employing a 1 x 1 m grid divided into 100 10 x 10 cm su b-grids. Grids were randomly placed at three locations in each plot. Presence/absence in each sub-grid was recorded for each cushion plant species. Statistical Analyses All analyses were made with S-PLUS 4.5, and results were considered significant if P <0.05. Although data from previous years are cite d in the results, statistical analyses were made only on data collected in 2002. 78 Herbaceous Plant Biomass Biomass data were analyzed to te st for differences inside and outside of permanent exclosures. Four components of total herbaceous biomass were analyzed separately: live grass, current year's dead grass, previous years' dead grass, and forbs. Two-way (site x plot type) factorial ANOVAs were used to test for biomass di fferences in each biomass component and for total biomass. For each biomass component, tests for the effect of the permanent exclosures were performed through separate analyses. Individual clipped pl ots (5/plot type/site) were used as samples. Biomass varies widely across sites, and the site factor was included to account for this variance without reducing sample size by using site means as samples. Shrub Production Number of CAGs, mean CAG mass, and CAG mass/shrub were analyzed with three-factor analysis of variance (shrub size class x site x plot type). Because Cercocarpus shrubs were sampled at only two sites, individual shrubs were used as replicates. Interaction terms were included based on previous results (Gerhardt and Detling, 1998). The square root of number of CAGs was used in analyses. Plant Cover and Species Richness Plant cover and species richness data were analyzed to test for differences inside and outside of permanent exclosures. Cover data were analyzed by functional groups (Grass, Forbs, Cushion plants, Shrubs/dwarf shrubs, Cercocarpus , Cactus) to allow comparisons with previous data and provide input for available vegetation models (Singer and Schoenecker, 2000). Paired t-tests were used to compare cover and species richness inside and outside of permanent exclosures. Data from inside and outside of permanent exclosures at ea ch site were considered to be pairs. Previous analyses indicate that cover and richness range widely across sites. Paired t-tests were chosen to reduce the variability caused by site differences and provide a more powerful statistical test. Separate analyses were used for the absolute and relative cover of each plant functional group, and on the Cercocarpusabsolute cover of bare ground, litter, rock, and total plant cover. Sample size was 12 pairs for all variables except (n = 3) and cushion plants (n = 10). Cover data (sin -1 x ) and richness data ( x ) were transformed before analysis. Cushion Plants Cushion plant frequency data from the two Dryhead sites were pooled for analysis. Analysis of variance for the effects of permanent exclosures and site were conducte d using grids as replicates (n = 12). Separate analyses were run for four the two Lockhart Ranch sites were pooled and analyzed similarly, however the plot factor had three levels (grazed/tram pled, exclosed, native) and sample size was higher (n = 18). Regression Analyses To explore the relationships between grazing effects, precipitation, and wild horse population levels, several correlations and regressions were done on previous and current data. Total peak biomass data for 1992-1996 (summarized in Gerhardt and Detling, 2000), annual horse count data (L. Coates-Markle, oral commun., 2002), and monthly precipitation data from the Lovell weather station (National Climatic Data Center website, 2002) were used. 79 Trends in horse population, local annual precipitati on, and local water year precipitation (October-June was used because sampling occurred in early July) from 1968 (when the PMWHR was established) to 2002 are informative (Figure 2). Although the long-term trend in wild horse population level is relatively flat, the horse population has been managed at higher numbers since vegetation monitoring began in 1992. Both annual precipitation and water year precipitation have tended to decrease since 1968, but linear trends are not significant (Pearson r = -0.25 and -0.12 respectively; P >0.15). Since 1992 when vegetation monitoring began, annual precipitation has been above the long-term average five years, but water year precipitation has been above average only twice and has been consistently below average since 1996. A plot of cumulative precipitation from 1992 through the sampling date in 2002 suggests that the area was in a multi-year precipitation deficit during the 2002 sampling period (Figure 3). The trend in vegetation dynamics at the exclosures in the PMWHR and BICA is generally for lower mean biomass both inside and outside the exclosures (Appendix A). However, an overall average for each year is derived from different numbers of exclosures each year with most newer exclosures established in lower elevation, lower production areas. To accommodate this limitation, grazing effects were calculated as a percent difference inside and outside permanent exclosures ([biomass inside - biomass outside]/biomass inside). For each year, only data from exclosures at least 1-year old were incl uded. Difference data were regressed against and correlated with three factors: current year's wild horse annual count, previous year's wild horse annual count, and water year precipitation. Results Herbaceous Biomass Averaged across sites, biomass differe nces inside and outside of permanen t exclosures were significant for all variables tested: total herbaceous biom ass, live grass, current year's dead gr ass, old dead gras s, and forbs (all P <0.001). Total biomass and grass components were higher inside the exclosure, while biomass of forbs was greater outside the exclosures (Figure 4). The interaction (plot type x site) was significant for all biomass components (all P <0.002) and nearly significant for total herbaceous biomass ( P = 0.057). The interaction term tests whether exclosure effects were similar across the 12 sites. A significant interaction indicates that biomass differences were not consistent at all sites (Appendix B). Of the five biomass components, the most consistent differences are in the grass components. It was not possible to statistically compare vegetation inside and outsid e exclosures separately for each site, however data are plotted separately for each site in Appendix B, showing that grass is higher inside exclos ures at all sites except for Penn's Cabin. Although average forb biomass was significan tly lower inside exclosures, some sites had greater forb biomass inside exclosures. Photographs inside and outside exclosures are provided in Attachment A. Shrub Production CAG and shrub production was similar at both sites (Figure 5; all P <0.20), and was not affected by the permanent exclosures (Figure 6; all P <0.25). Shrub size had significant effects on number of CAG twigs, mean CAG mass, and CAG production/shrub (Figure 7; P <0.005). 80 Figure 2.

Similar to absolute cover, the relative cover of grasses was higher inside than ou tside exclosures (grazed = 0.22, exclosed = 0.34; P = 0.013). Species Richness Species richness was slightly but significantly higher inside permanent exclosures (Table 2 and Appendix C; P = 0.018, mean difference = 1. 4 species). The largest difference was obse rved at the North Lockhart Ranch site (5 species) followed by Bat Cave (4 species; Figure 1). Richness data were obtained from Daubenmire cover sampling and do not represent a comple te list of species at the site. Cushion Plant Dynamics At the sites inside the PMWHR (North and South Dryhead ), frequency of all four cushion plant species in mapped grids was similar inside and ou tside permanent exclosures (Table 3; P. bryoides, P hookeri , = Only P. hoodii differed between sites ( P <0.001). At sites established in BICA outside of the current Range, cushion plant frequency was compared among three plot types: grazed/trampled, exclosed, and native. Both Phlox species differed significantly among plot types (P. bryoides , = 0.003; P. hoodii , P <0.001). Phlox hoodii was much more prevalent in native plots than in either grazed or exclosed plots (Tukey P <0.001) but did not differ between grazed and exclosed plots (Tukey P = 0.878). Phlox bryoides showed an opposite response and was significantly higher in grazed and exclosed plots than in the native plot (Tukey P <0.01). Again, differences between grazed and exclosed plots were not significant (Tukey P = 0.895). The other two species did not show significant differences between plots (Table 3, P <0.10). Only A. hookeri frequency differed between sites ( P = 0.039). Photographs of sampling grid s in each plot type at each site are provided in Attachment A for visual comparisons and future reference. Regression Analyses Percent biomass difference tended to increase with both current and past year's wild horse population and decrease with increasing precip itation although regressions were not sign ificant (Figure 8). Simple correlations between biomass difference and both past wild horse population and precipitation were nearly significant (current population: r = 0.52, P = 0.29; past population: r = 0.79, P = 0.06; precipitation: r = -0.78, P = 0.07; n = 6). This suggests that average grazing effects in crease as the wild horse population increases and decrease in years with higher precipitation. Although grazing effects were det ected, the effect of the exclosur e was not significant across sites (significant site x exclosure interaction), with some ar eas showing much stronger excl osure effects (Appendix B) than others. The heterogeneous distribution of grazing effects agrees with past sampling data and is consistent with modeling results, indicating that grazing distribution and intensity varies across the PMWHR and BICA (Coughenour, 2000). 83 Control Exclosed 0 25 50 75 100 125 150 # of CAGs CAG mass (g) Plot 0.12 0.10 0.08 0.06 0.04 0.02 0.00 Plot 0 2 4 6 8 10 ion (g) Shrub product Plot Figure 5.

Differences between sh rubs in control plots and permanent exclosures were not significant. Discussion Herbaceous Biomass Total herbaceous biomass and biomass of live and dead grass were higher inside permanent exclosures, while forb biomass was significantly higher outside. Previous analyses have found biomass differences inside and outside permanent exclosures (Peterson and others, 1997; Peterson, 1999; Gerhardt and Detling, 1998), and previous analyses comparing across years and sites have found nearly significant differences inside and outside permanent exclosures (Gerhardt and Detling, 2000). In general, significantly higher biomass inside exclosures has only been found previously at certain sites (Fores t Service, North and South Dryhead, S ykes Ridge) when sites where analyzed individually, or when analyses included these sites. Gerhardt and Detling (2000) analyzed multi-year data from 10 of the sites sampled in 2002, and two high elevation sites established in 1994 but not sampled this year (Figure 1). The North and South Lockhart Ranch sites were substituted in 2002 to include lower elevation areas used by bighorn sheep. The two sites not sampled in 2002 are both high-elevation, high-p roduction sites with relatively high forb cover. Horse access to one of these sites (Subalpine, Figure 1) may now be limited due to fencing. The Lockhart Ranch sites are dry, low-elevation, relatively low-production sites inside BICA but outside the PMWHR and therefore not grazed by horses. Bare ground and cushion cover is relatively high. The substitution of these site s invariably had some effect on the results of biomass and other vegetation variables, especi ally in decreasing the average biomass compared to previous years. Detection of range-wide grazing effects in 2002 could be the result of several factors. Biomass differences may be the result of aging exclosures, with differences taking several years to develop. The youngest exclosures were constructed in 1994, and biomass differences may have developed gradually over the years. Alternatively, low precipitation and relatively high horse populations may have increased the effect of grazing during the current year only. If this is the case, biomass differences should be expected to decrease if precipitation is high, horse populations are lower, or other management options are pursued which distribute horse and sheep grazing or improve currently used habitat. 86 Table 2.

Mean difference in total herbaceous biomass inside and outside permanent exclosures plotted against current year's horse population, previous year's horse population, and water year precipitation (October-June). Data were collected 1992-1996 and 2002. Mean biomass was calculated as the quotient of the di fference inside and outside divided by the biomass inside the exclosure. Regression statistics: horse population P = 0.24, R2 = 0.33; previous year's horse population P = 0.20, R2 = 0.37; precipitation P = 0.12, R2 = 0.49. Shrub Production The significant effect of shrub size on number of CAGs and total shrub production was expected. This size classification was originally designed to allow CAG production to be estimated over larger areas by providing an estimate of average shrub production (Gerhardt and Detling, 1998). Larger shrubs had many more CAGs than smaller shrubs and more total production (Figure 5), however individual CAG mass was significantly higher on small shrubs. These results differ from prior analyses which showed more an d larger CAGs on the largest shrubs (Gerhardt and Detling, 1998) and significant site differences. Compared to previous years, CAG mass was lower in 2002, especially on large shrubs. In addition, the number of CAGs produced per shrub was lower than in previous years, and again reduced production was particularly evident on the largest shrubs. Lower Cercocarpus production could result in less available shrub forage for bighorn sheep, however shrub offtake and forage availability were not estimated. 88 Plant Cover and Species Richness The differences in grass cover contributed strongly to the significant difference in total plant cover, with grass cover higher inside than outside exclosures at 10 of 12 sites (Table 2 and Appendix C). Grass cover was only higher outside the exclosure at Penn's Cabin. Lower plant cover and biomass inside the exclosure at this site have been found previously (Fahnestock 1999; Peterson and others, 1997). Despite the influence of grass cover on total plant cover differences, site ranks for total plant cover and grass cover were not identi cal, with the site showing the highest difference in total cover (Sykes Ridge) ranking third in grass cover difference (Appendix C). Results from Sykes Ridge, Forest Service, and South Dryhead should be viewed with some caution when comparing to other years' data. At these sites, the grazed plot was in a slightly different location from previous sampling efforts based on the need to sample adjacent to temporary gr azing cages. However, data from these sites ar e valid for the current analyses, as grazed plots were still near permanent exclosures in visually similar habitat and vegetation. These results differ from previous results in which data were analyzed across sites. Analyses of cover data from 1992-1996 found a significant exclosure effect only for relative grass cover, although effects were nearly significant for absolute grass and litter cover (Gerhardt and Detling, 2000). In addition, paired t-test analyses of 1998 cover data from six sites found no significant differences inside and outside of permanent exclosures (Gerhardt, 2000). Site-specific analyses by functional group or individual species show differences in cover inside and outside exclosures at some sites and during some years (Fahnestock and Detling, 2000; Fahnestock and Detling, 1999). Cushion Plant Dynamics Cushion plants were mapped at two pairs of sites: North and South Dryhead and North and South Lockhart Ranch (Figure 1). All four are low-elevation, low-gradient sites located in grassland/juniper-grassland habitat within BICA. Cushion plant mapping was in itiated at each site in 1994 an d continued during 1995 and 1996. Because of the history of site es tablishment, the Dryhead sites and the Lockhart Ranch sites measure responses to different system dynamics and management actions. To best interpret results, original site selection and plot placement should be considered. Pe rmanent exclosures were erected at the Dryhead sites in 1992, primarily to monitor vegetation dynamics related to horse grazing. Permanent exclosures were established at the Lockhart Ranch sites in 1994 along the west side of Highway 14 outside the PMWHR boundary. When the exclosures were established, the road (Highway 14) serv ed as a travel corridor for cattle trai ling through BICA in spring and fall. Cattle were concentrated in the area by a fenceline to the east and a fenceline and gate immediately north of the North Lockhart Ranch Site. The impact of cattle trailing and grazing near the road wa s identified as a management concern because this area had previously been identifie d as supporting a rare cu shion plant community. The Lockhart Ranch sites were established specifically to address BICA questions about the possible impact of cattle trailing on cushion plant communities. At each Lockhart Ranch site, three 25 x 25 m plots were established: control, exclosed, and native plots. Two plots were paired on opposite sides of the road, both of which were lined with cattle trails running approximately parallel to the road. A perman ent exclosure was established around one of these plots to monitor changes in cushion plant communities when protected from additional trailing. A third 25 x 25 m plot (native) was established west of the road in areas where cattle trails were not evident. There is no evidence that horse grazing is affecting cushion plant frequency/cover based on sampling inside and outside permanent exclosur es. No species showed signif icant grazing/exclosure effe cts at the North and South Dryhead sites (Table 3). At the Lockhart Ranch sites Phlox hoodii was much more common in native plots than in either grazed/trampled or exclos ed plots. In contrast, P. bryoides was less common in native plots. Differences between exclosed and nearby grazed/trampled plots were not significant for any species. The relative absence of P. hoodii in the grazed/trampled plot and the exclosed (previously grazed/trampled) suggests that cattle trailing reduced cover of this species, and that cover is not rebounding quickly toward more natural conditions. Trails are still clearly visible inside the exclosures (Attachment B), suggesting that these sites recover relatively slowly when trampled to bare ground. If cattle trailing continues thr ough these areas, periodic sampling at these sites could show whether cushion 89 plant community composition along the tr ails converges with the untrampled communities. Differences in species responses are likely due to differences in response to trampling or possibly to some effects of the road, as cushion plant species are not heavily grazed by cattle. In addition, the lower height of these 2 exclosures may not exclude deer, so some non-cattle grazing may still occur inside the exclosures. Regression Analyses Regressions indicate that grazing effects from an in creasing wild horse population are mitigated for by increased precipitation. Thus drier years will show greater gr azing effects when the wild horse population is higher, or closer to AML, than wetter years. This suggests that low levels of precipitation over the past few years are adding to the current range conditions. Conclusions and Management Considerations Vegetation monitoring in 2002 detected significant differences inside and outside the permanent exclosures for herbaceous biomass and cover. Tota l herbaceous biomass and grass biomass were lower outside exclosures at most sites; forb biomass and litter were generally higher inside exclosures (Figure 2 and Appendix B). Although not quite significant, correlations between percent biomass difference inside and outside exclosures with horse populations and precipitation suggest that biomass differences increase with increasing horse numbers and decrease with increasing precipitation (Figure 8). Total cover and grass cover were significantly lower ou tside exclosures. Mean speci es richness was slightly higher (1.4 species) inside exclosures. Effects were not distributed equally across the exclosure network, and differences were greater at some sites than at others (Appendix B and Table 2). Shrub production and cushion plant frequencies did not show effects due to exclosures. Shrub production was similar at both sampling sites and inside and outside exclosures. There is no evidence that horse grazing is affecting cushion plant frequency/cover based on sampling inside and outside permanent exclosures. At two sites inside the BICA and the PMWHR cushion plant frequencie s in mapped plots did not differ between grazed and ungrazed plots. Recommendations for Future Sampling If managers plan to use the model developed by Coughenour (1999, 2000) to interpret system dynamics or predict the effects of natural events and planned management actions, vegetation monitoring should be prioritized based on the model tool. The model requires spatially-explicit data and generates spatially-explicit results. Planned (e.g., creating or eliminating water sources, fencing, ha bitat manipulation) and unplanned (e.g., natural fires, droughts, disease, range expansion) events influence grazing patterns, and the effects are likely to be detectable through vegetation monitoring at some sites more than others. The following suggestions are made for future monitoring efforts and use of monitoring data: 1. Sampling efforts should focus on sampling all sites, or as many possible. Because grazing distribution and habitat use and overlap are management concerns, coll ecting data at the larges t number of exclosures possible seems wise. The ability of the model to utilize data distributed across the landscape and make localized predictions of vegetation dynamics is fully used when the full exclosure network is sampled. 2. Biomass measurements inside and outside the exclosur es are important. Coughenour (1999) identified the lack of data on plant production in the long-term ab sence of grazing, and sugges ted that peak biomass be monitored across the exclosure network. In addition, species composition differences inside and outside exclosures in the PMWHR and BICA are and others, 1999; Gerhardt and Detling, 2000) and probably respond more slowly to changes in grazing patterns. If only biomass were sampled, some information about grass:forb:litter ra tios could be obtained by sorting samples. More 90 intensive or full-scale monitoring effo rts across the exclosures could be done occasionally, and site-specific concerns could be addressed with specific sampling designs. 3. Collected data should be incorporated into the developed ecosystem model when possible. Coughenour (1999) showed that vegetation dynamics vary across the PMWHR and BICA landscape. Detecting large-scale trends in biomass or grazing intensity is complicated by the large differences in vegetation between sites. Averaging across sites and utilizing traditional statistics without including spatial information makes interpretation difficult, especially when different site s are sampled in different years. The ecosystem model is designed to make spatially explicit predictions a bout grazing patterns and vegetation dynamics, allowing informed decisions to be made at a landscape level. Including additional data also allows the model to be refined and accuracy improved. 4. Site specific questions may require more intensive sampling than is needed for monitoring efforts. The current study sampled 5 plot s inside and outside excl osures at each site. This level of sampling proved sufficient to detect differences due to grazing when data was analyzed across the exclosure network. However, statistical tests at each site would have little power with this few samp les. One example of where higher sample sizes could be required is in detecting offtake. Some attempts to detect growing season or monthly grazing offtake using temporary cages demonstr ate the large sample sizes that can be required, especially when vegetation is patchy and bare ground is high (Peterson and others, 1997; Peterson, 1999). Sampling efforts designed to detect localized or shor t-term effects should cons ider the probable need for higher sample sizes, especially at lower elevation sites.

Habitat Modeling 137 138Bighorn Sheep Habitat Suitability Assessment of the Greater Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area: A Higher Resolution Analysis By Michelle A. Gudorf, Denver, Colorado 139 140Statement of the Proble m and Study Objective In 1996, the National Park Service (NPS) and U.S. Geological Survey, Biological Resources Discipline (USGS-BRD) prepared a report that identified areas of suitable habitat for bighorn sheep restoration in the greater Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area (BICA) (Gudorf and others, 1996). In August 2001, the USGS-BRD obtained funding to r eevaluate the area. Our objective was to evaluate potential suitable bighorn sheep habitat in the greater BI CA using improved data. This reassessment identifies habitat factors that limit bighorn sheep in the region, and evaluates and identifies occupied and unoccupied habitat. The model was run in two ways, both with and without a criteria of \"proximity to perennial water sources.\" Methods The Habitat Evaluation Procedure Habitat parameters considered critical for Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep ( Ovis canadensis canadensis ) were defined by Smith and others (1991). These parameters were derived from the literature, applied to a population of bighorn sheep on Bear Mountain, Utah and used to develop a model for evaluating bighorn sheep habitat (Smith and others 1991). The model was tested and refined (Johnson and Swift, 2000) by evaluating habitat parameters in areas with successful versus unsuccessful bighorn sheep translocations in Colorado. The model identifies regions of habitat adequate to support a minimum viable population of bighorn sheep. A population of 100-125 individuals has been proposed as the number of bighorn sheep necessary for short-term persistence through several decades (San ds, 1976; Van Dyke and others, 1983; Berger, 1990). For this analysis, a minimum viable population was defined as 125 bighorn (Smith and others, 1991). Metapopulations were defined as collective subpopulations with limited gene flow (Bleich and others, 1990). The habitat model incorporates a process of eliminati on, where land area is syst ematically removed from consideration if it does not m eet specific habitat criteria. Remaining land areas may be considered suitable bighorn sheep habitat. Patches of habitat deemed suitable must be of sufficient size to sustain a viable population or must occur in proximity, such that the combined area would support a viable metapopulation. Data Values for the bighorn sheep model parameters were obtained from field observations, historical records, digital data and paper maps, and census and aerial point locations from a Global Positioning System (GPS) (Table 1). These values were used to identify regions of the study area that met specific ha bitat criteria identified in the model. The model did not consider forage type and biomass, predation, interagency plans for adjacent regions, or wild ungulate concentrations. 141 Table 1 .

The study area was determined from approximately a one quad extension from the northern, eastern, and southern boundaries of BICA, and a two quad extension from the western boundary, in an effort to identify all suitable bighorn habitat within the vicinity of BICA (Figure 1). The study area encompasses 3418.81 km2, and Definition of Bighorn Sheep Habitat Parameters Habitat Requirements Six key habitat criteria identified in the bighorn sheep habitat assessments used for this analysis were integrated in a geographic information system (GIS) to dete rmine areas of suitable habitat (Smith and others, 1991; Johnson and Swift, 2000). Geophysical and biological habitat parameters include buffered escape terrain, aspect, horizontal visibility, proximity to perennial water sour ces, natural barriers, and snowpack. Land management parameters are human activities, constr ucted barriers, and livestock grazing. In the 1996 analysis, we defined escape terrain as slopes from 27\u00b0-85\u00b0 based on the Smith and others (1991) conversions of percent slope to degree slope. However, we later noted that the conversion should actually be 30\u00b0. Therefore, escape terrain was defined for this analysis as slopes 30\u00b0- 90\u00b0. In Wyoming, bighorn sheep have been known to utilize vertical rock walls with shelves large enough for footholds, thus the range of known utilized slopes was increased from 85\u00b0-90\u00b0 (Hughes, 1997). These slopes provide protection from predators and disturbances and are a critical feature for bighorn sheep (Honess and Wilson and others, 1980; Van Dyke and others, 1983). Land areas surrounding th e escape terrain that were within 300 m, or within 1,000 m when the area was bordered by escape terrain on mo re than two sides (enabling sheep to view escape terrain 1,000 m in the distance) were considered to be close enough to escape terrain for bighorn sheep to seek refuge during disturbances. These areas (henceforth referred to as \"core habitat\") provide the core area of potential suitable habitat. From this core habitat we removed land areas that included any of the following six features: 1) Horizontal Visibility: Areas that had less than 62% horizontal visibility. Horizontal visibility is a value used to express the openness of the habitat. Bighorn sheep are better able to detect predators and other disturbances, as well as maintain contact with members of their herd in areas with good visibility. In this study, horizontal visibility was defined as the percenta ge of a bighorn's lateral view that was not obscured by vegetation. Visibility was measured along predator ap proach paths, not into, or over, cliffs. Areas with horizontal visibility 62% or greater were considered suitable. Areas of 30-61% visibility were acceptable, if less than 4,500 m in width, because sheep could use these areas as movement corridors. Additionally, areas of less than 30% visibility if less than 100m in width were also defined as acceptable following Johnson and Swift (2000). 143 Figure 1 . Study and focus areas for the bighorn sheep suitable habitat analysis within the greater Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area (BICA), Montana and Wyoming. 144 2) Proximity to Perennial Water Sources : Areas more than 3.2 km from perennial water sources. Proximity to perennial water sources should be within 3.2 km of the core area (McQuivey, 1978; Smith and others, 1991). However, in drought years bighorn sheep will range greater than 3.2 km for water. Water sources for bighorn sheep include seeps, springs, and perennial snow patches as well as riverine and lacustrine features (Smith and others, 1991). As these types of perennial and intermittent water sources have not been adequately mapped in this study area, the inclusion of this parameter is questionable. Therefore, the model was run both including and excluding this criterion, so resource managers can ma ke the decision as to which results to use. 3) Human Use Areas: Areas that are developed and land within 150 m of these areas if the disturbance was severe enough to elicit avoidance by bighorns (e.g., residential, commercial, or industrial developments, major highways, and structures). 4) Natural and Manmade Barriers to Bighorn Sheep Movement: Areas that contained barriers to routine bighorn movement: manmade barriers (e.g. fences, roads, canals, aquaducts, housing developments, reservoirs) and natural barriers (impassable cliffs, large or fast moving bodies of water, great distances between escape terrain, corridors of dense vegetation). These features we re identified and evaluated on a case-by-case basis for determination of their hindrance to bighorn sheep occupancy of an area or movement through an area. Any areas determined a hindrance and in union with core habitat were considered unsuitable and removed from core habitat. This criterion wasn't modeled to determine suitable habitat, however, any barriers will be provided as an overlay and should be considered by managers prior to translocation. 5) Proximity to Exotic Relatives: Areas occupied by domestic sheep. Domestic sheep (and introduced exotic populations of Ovis genus) harbor diseases that infect bighorn sheep. Disease transmissions from domestic sheep have caused catastrophic die-offs of bighorn (2000) found that populations of translocated bighorn sheep separated by less than 4.6 \u00b1 1.4 km were unsuccessful, populati ons with separations from 12.3 \u00b1 4.6 km were moderately successful, and populations with separations from 23.0 \u00b1 6.5 km were successful. Maintaining a larger distance between domestic sheep and bighorn sheep reduced the probability of disease transmission. This criterion was not modeled to exclude suitable habitat, however, the overlay provided of the domestic sheep grazing allotments and their proximity to suitable bighorn sheep habitat must be considered by managers prior to translocation. For purposes of this model, the buffer zones of domestic sheep grazing allotments range from 0-7 km (unsuccessful), 7-17 km (moderately successful), and 17-29 km (very successful). 6) Patch Size: Isolated patches of habitat that are too small to support a minimum viable population of bighorn sheep. Hughes (1997) suggests removing contiguous patches less than 100 ha for suitable habitat, 25 ha for winter habitat, and 52 ha for summer habitat in size from consideration. Hughes calculated these patch sizes based on the Smith and others (1991) suggestion that a 100-ha patch of suitable habitat will likely support no more than 4 sheep. Seasonal Range Requirements Bighorn sheep have varying habitat needs during different periods of the year. Specific ranges for summer, winter, and lambing period were determined by removing areas from the modeled suitable habitat that did not meet the criteria for that seasonal range. Summ er range is defined as the buffered area of escape terrain found within the area of suitable habitat (excluding the actual area of the slopes (30\u00b0- 90\u00b0). Winter range is defined as only southern aspects of slopes 30\u00b0-90\u00b0 (135\u00b0-225\u00b0 aspects) within suitable habitat and less than 25 cm snowpack. Average snowpack data was unavailable for 80% of the study area and was not included in this analysis. Lambing habitat was defined as all suitable habitat greater than 2 hectares (to reduce vulnerabilit y of ewes and young to predation and sensitivity to disturbance), with southern, western, and ea stern aspects (90\u00b0-270\u00b0 aspect s) with 31\u00b0-90\u00b0 slopes, and within 1,000 m of perennial water sources. Birthing typically occurs on the steepest slopes, but \"lambing period habitat\" also encompasses areas used during the six-week postpartum period before ewes and lambs join nursery groups. 145 Model Modifications Zeigenfuss and others (2000) tested the Smith and others (1991) model accuracy in predicting translocation success and then modified it to include additional factors that improved its usefulness in predic ting appropriate translocation sites. They found translocations were more successful when sheep were placed into discrete habitat patches containing a high proportion of lambing period habitat (greater than 4% of suitable habitat) where animals could exhibit a migratory tendency, and no contact with domestic sheep or a greater distance to domestic sheep allotments (greater than 23 km). The rate of population growth for bighorn sheep populations was best predicted by area of lambing period habitat, potential area of winter range, and distance to domestic sheep (Zeigenfuss and others, 2000). Additionally, they proposed that th e minimum area for release be at least 32 km 2 for prairie-badlands topography, 85 km2 for Rocky Mountain topography, and 381 km2 for Colorado Plateau deserts topography [far larger than the minimum 17 km2 proposed by Smith and others (1991)]. Finally, they proposed that lambing habitat should constitute 4% or more of the suitable habitat, and summer habitat should be 19 km2 or larger (Zeigenfuss and others, 2000). Focus Areas In the 1996 analysis, the study area was divided in to 4 focus areas (Gudorf and others, 1996). The focus areas were delineated by natural separations in suitable habitat along the Bighorn River, and by adequate patch size determined by the results of the analysis. We have used the same focus areas for this 2002 analysis (Figure 1). Results The greater BICA study area is 3,418 km2. We identified 993 km2 of core habitat. This area total varies significantly from the 1996 analysis (Gudorf and others, 1996) where 2,170.75 km2 of buffered escape terrain or \"core\" habitat was identified. The differen ce in the total area occurs in the iden tification of slopes. Slope delineation occurs by running an algorithm defined by a simple command in spatial software on the digital elevation model data (DEMs). I used degrees of slope in the 2002 analysis that were different from the 1996 analysis (30\u00b0-90\u00b0 in 2002 vs. 27\u00b0-85\u00b0 in 1996). For the purpose of understanding where the discrepancy arose, I created a test slope file. In the 1996 analysis, the GRASS GIS software used to run the habitat suitability model identified a total of 711 km 2 of slopes 27\u00b0-85\u00b0. In this 2002 analysis, the ArcInfo/GRID GIS software used to run the habitat suitability model identified 284 km2 of 27\u00b0-85\u00b0 slopes. This significantly re duces the amount of available core habitat (and thus suitable habitat) for this analysis compared with the 1996 analysis. A complete analysis of this discrepancy has not been done. The difference in slope identification could occur either in the different DEM data sources used in both analyses, or in the different GIS software (and algorithms) used. Following are the results of the land area removed from the 993 km2 of core habitat based on the habitat suitability model discussed in previous sections of this report (Table 2). 146 Table 2. Quantifiable criteria used in the GIS for determination of land area suitable for bighorn sheep in the 3,418 km2 study area for the greater BICA. Note that there is some overlap of ex clusionary criteria in some areas (e.g., removal of land areas due to poor horizontal visibility and proximity to perennial water sources).

Schoenecker (USGS-BRD, Ft. Collins, CO) in November 2001 to determine horizontal visibility in each vegetation zone. Twelve vegetation classification zones were identified. Zones with less than 62% horizontal visibility were considered unsuitable habitat for bighorn sheep. A total of 103.69 km2 were removed from the core habitat due to low horizontal visibility.

A total of 95.95 km2 were removed from the core habitat due to this criterion. (Note: A second analysis was run excluding this criterion.) Human Use Areas Human use areas such as residential, commercial and industrial areas removed 37.72 km2 from core habitat. Primary roads were buffered 150 m and all other roads assigned 30 m widths. A total of 50.83 km2 were removed from the core habitat due to this criterion. 148 Natural and Manmade Barriers No natural landscape features in the study area were considered permanent barriers to bighorn sheep movements (Gudorf and others, 1996). Bighorn Canyon an d Bighorn Lake may be view ed as obstacles, and yet bighorn sheep reportedly dispersed from Devil's Canyon to the western side of Bighorn Canyon (Coates and Schemnitz, 1989). Bighorn may be able to cross the lake during winter freeze-ups, althoug h radio-tracking data over the past 3 years has revealed no animal locations on the east side of Bighorn Lake (K. Schoenecker, unpub. data, 2003). No roads or trails were considered barriers. No impassable stretches of fence line were noted (Gudorf and others, 1996). New fences constructed in the recreation area incorporate modifications recommended by Helvie (1971) to allow for the passage of bighorn sheep. However, al l translocation sites should be inspected for fences that would hinder or impede bighorn sheep movements, and such fences should be modified by installing crawl under/over areas, or removed. Domestic Sheep Grazing Domestic sheep allotments occur in the southeastern and southwestern corners of the study area. Burt Jellison (Sheridan Region Wyoming Game and Fish Department, oral commun., 2001) indicated that the Wyoming Game and Fish has a Sheep Biologist Working Group involved in buying out domestic sheep grazing permittees and when possible, transferring allotmen ts from the Absaroka Mountains to the Bighorn Mountains. The USFS is promoting sheep grazing over cattle grazing allotments in the northeastern WY area (Jack Manoni, oral commun., 2001). The Beaver Creek allotment is within the study area. Consider any area of suitable bighorn habitat 17-29 km or greater from the domestic sheep allotm ents as suitable. All areas of suitable ha bitat that are less than 17 km from domestic sheep grazing allotments are identified. A total of 154.62 km 2 of otherwise 823.90 km2 suitable bighorn sheep habitat could be removed from suitable habitat due to sheep grazing allotments. Patch Size Habitat patches too small to have any value as habitat, should be eliminated. Hughes (1997) suggests removing contiguous patches less than 100 ha for suitable habitat, 25 ha for winter habitat, and 52 ha for summer habitat from consideration. Hughes calculated these patch sizes based on the Smith and others (1991) suggestion that a 100-ha patch of suitable habitat will likely support no more than 4 sheep (Tables 3 and 4). Focus Areas Habitat patches should be large enough to support a minimum viable population of bighorn sheep. We have determined the BICA region to be best represented by the prairie-badlands type topography. Therefore, using the calculations derived by the Zeigenfuss and others (2002) for a minimum viable population of bighorn sheep, areas smaller than 32 km 2 for general suitable habitat, 6.5 km2 for winter range, 8.4 km2 for summer range, and 4% of the suitable habitat for lambing habitat should not be considered for translocations (Tables 3 and 4). 149 Table 3. Estimates of bighorn sheep habitat in the greater BI CA, based on habitat criteria defined in this report including the criterion for proximity to perennial water sources . Areas identified here represent habitat both prior to and after reductions due to patch size requirements. After patch size requirement reductions, the remaining areas must be large enough to support a minimum viable population of bighorn sheep (125) based on the Zeigenf uss and others (2000) calculations. Focus area totals are based on area available after patch size requirement reductions. These results do not take into account the effects of domestic sheep on the availability of bighorn sheep habitat. Note that southeastern and southwestern por tions of the study area have a number of domestic sheep grazing allotments that will reduce the amount of available habitat if not managed.

Includes proximity to perennial water sources criteria. Most habitat reductions due to domestic sheep grazing occur in focus areas 2 and 3, and as most of the areas of suitable habitat occur in fo cus area 2, this report has only included the habitat reductions fo r focus area 2. Zeigenfuss and others (2000) found that populations of bighorn sheep separated by less than 4.6+ 1.4 km were unsuccessful, populations with separations from 12.3+ 4.6 km were moderately successful, and populations with separations from 23.0+ 6.5 km were successful. For this model, the buffer zones from domestic sheep grazing allotments range from 0-7 km (unsucces sful), 7-17 km (moderately s uccessful), and 17-29 km (very successful). Areas falling within the 17-29 km buffer zone area are included in the analysis as they represent the range of 23 km+ 6.5 km.

Impacts that cattle have on bighorn sheep such as forage competition are not clearly understood. It has been suggested that cattle should be restricted from bighorn sheep watering sites to limit possible transmission of disease (Jessup, 1985). The presence of cattle has had less effect on bighorn sheep herd heal th than the presence of domestic sheep (Dodd and Brady, 1986). Mountain lion predation is a mortality factor in the bighorn sheep herds in BICA (Gudorf and others, 1996; K. Schoenecker, oral commun., 2003). Predation was determined to be the cause of death of two radio-collared bighorn sheep in BICA in previous studies (Irby and others, 1995), and the cause of 13 radio-collared bighorn sheep mortalities over a 3 year period (K. Schoenecker, oral commun., 2003). K. Schoenecker and F. Singer (USGS-BRD, Fort Collins, CO) conducted a study of plant forage quantity and quality in the study area, however, results weren't available at the time of this analysis. Results could be incorporated into the vegetation maps identifying areas of greater productivity. These results could be used to produce an overlay in GIS and incorporat ed into the results of this analysis. In his masters thesis, Lee Hughes (1997) developed a method for incorporating forage quantity (percent cover) and quality into the habitat suitability model. Discussion It is important to view the suitable habitat data al ongside the seasonal range data to identify areas supporting all range requirements. According to this analysis, focus areas 1 and 2 have adequate suitable habitat and summer and winter seasonal habitat to support a minimum viable population of bighorn sheep. However, according to this analysis, lambing habitat is limited in all focus areas. Resource managers and wildlife biologists have observed ewes lambing within a microhabitat of benches along the cliffs of the Bighorn Canyon (F. Singer, K. Schoenecker, oral commun., 2002). They have GPS point data of lambing sites. We recommend further analysis of lambing sites by overlaying the GPS points with aspect, suitable habitat, forage quantity and quality data, in addition to any known predation information to determine if the limited lambing patch size predicted in this model will restrict growth of the population and id entify if sheep are indeed using the areas of lambing habitat predicted by the model. From January 2001 through October 2001, bighorn sheep locations were GPS'd by USGS-BRD field crews along the Bighorn Canyon. Bighorn sheep locations along Bighorn Canyon are overlayed onto suitable habitat (without proximity to water sources criterion) in Figure 10. A brief visual check was done to determine if bighorns 159 Figure 10. Current (2001) bighorn sheep locations within BICA. Ea ch dot represents a group of bighorn sheep observed by ground crews. 160 were using the suitable habitat predicted in this analysis. By visual estimation, over half (approximately 65%) of the bighorn location points fall into areas of suitable habitat developed using patch size reduction and water criterion. If not falling within areas of suitable habitat, most fall with in 500-1,000 m of buffered escape terrain. Bighorn sheep locations are coinciding more closely with predicted suitable habitat without using the proximity to water criterion. Further analysis should explore whether using the water crit erion in this area benefits or limits the results of the model. Winter and summer locations are displayed over seasonal habitat maps in Figures 11 and 12. These data can be used to identify if seasonal ranges predicted by the model are being used by the sheep, and for further studies to determine if adequate seasonal habitat is present in Bighorn Canyon. Management of Habitat For an analysis of management options, we determined if it is possible to add back some habitat removed due to unsuitability. The following are the criteria that removed the habitat, and suggestions for management of these variables, if possible. 1. Elevation (slope steepness) and distance to slopes cannot be managed. This is not a viable management option. 2. Roads cannot be eliminated with ease, and won't add significan t area to the suitable habitat\u2014sheep also cross roads in most cases. This is not a viable management option. 3. Distance to known perennial water sources reduced 96 km2 of suitable habitat. Solutions may include installing guzzlers or ponds. However, the cost may be too great to consider this a solution. Additionally, there does not appear to be a way to model for water placement and all of its possible permutations, as there are an infinite number of possible placements. Finally, data mapping all perennial water sources may not be accurate enough to use as a criter ion for prediction of suitable bighorn sheep habitat. This may be a viable management practice, but cannot be determined in this analysis. 4. Human use areas cannot be eliminat ed with ease, and will not add significant area to the suitable habitat. Not likely a viable management option. 5. Improving horizontal visibility is cost effective. 64 km2 of suitable habitat were removed in this analysis due to poor horizontal visibility. Areas of dense vegetation known to be barriers to movement may be managed. This is a viable management option. 6. Isolated polygons or areas of su itable habitat smaller than 17 km are too small to support a viable population of bighorn sheep. It is possible that these small patches can be enlarged by improving the habitat surrounding them. These areas should be considered for possible expansion based on the results of management decisions to improve the habitat. These polygons will be included for visual display. 7. Distance to domestic sheep can be managed and at a reasonable cost. Eliminating or converting the domestic sheep grazing allotments could potentially add 154 km2 of suitable habitat. This is a viable management option. In summary, there are two viable criteria: managing for horizontal visibility and proximity to domestic sheep. This analysis identified areas of marginal bighorn sheep habitat due to poor horizontal visibility and domestic sheep grazing allotments that may be improved with management techniques. Proper mechanical thinning and prescribed burning may open up larger patches of otherwise unsuitable habitat, or create corridors linking patches of suitable habitat. To determine these areas of potential suita ble habitat, those areas that did not meet the horizontal visibility criteria are show n (Figure 13). All areas that cannot be mana ged (including inadequate escape terrain, distances too far from escape terrain, human use areas such as roads or developed areas, and distances too far from perennial water sources) remain excluded from the potentially manageable habitat identified in Figure 13. Note that this analysis of management mapping makes the assumption that all costs for mechanical thinning or burning are equal based on vegetation. Additionally, all cells (areas) are considered equal in accessibi lity. Areas removed due to small patch size that may be managed if poor horizontal visibility is improved can be identified in Figure 13 and Table 6. Managers can overlay this grid of potentially manageable patches onto the reclassed vegetation maps and the original vegetation classifications. Additionally, areas of low horizontal visibility that may improve the overall areas of suitable habitat, but are too close to do mestic sheep grazing allo tments, are identified. 161 Figure 11. Bighorn sheep locations (1015 points) within suitable winter habitat in Bighorn Canyon. Locations were GPS'd from 1/01 -3/01. 162 Figure 12. Bighorn sheep locations within suitable summer habitat in Bighorn Canyon. Locations GPS'd from 4/01-9/01. 163 Figure 13. Potential suitable bighorn sheep habitat if areas initially classified as having poor horizontal visibility (<62%) are cleare d or burned. Note that shaded areas represent areas of non-suit able habitat so that areas reduced due to small patch size can be identified and reviewed for possible inclusion if management of horizontal visibility will improve these areas. Non-shaded area s within the study area represent suitable habitat using the proximity to water criterion. 164 Persistence of bighorn sheep populations is strongly correlated to larger patch sizes of suitable habitat (Singer and others, 2001). The larger populations of bighorn sheep that may occupy larger patches of habitat conserve more genetic diversity, and are more likely to survive, persist, and increase following a dis ease outbreak (Berger, 1990, 1999; Singer and others, 2001). Populations of at least 300 animals were more likely to survive and recover from a disease epizootic (Singer and others, 2001). Once management improvement areas have been decided, then it can be determined if adequate seasonal habitat exists to support a minimum viable population of bighorns in the newly improved areas. Based on the results of this analysis, I recommend the manage rs of BICA take actions to increase both the patch size of suitable habitat and the overall size and quality of the habitat occupied by the current bighorn sheep populations.

Singer and Kathryn A. Schoenecker, U.S. Geological Survey 167 Introduction The purpose of this habitat suitability model is to provide a tool that will help managers and researchers better manage bighorn sheep and wild horses in the Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area (BICA) and Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Range (PMWHR). A concern in the management of the Pryor Mountain wild horse population is whether or not the wild horses compet e with bighorn sheep for availa ble forage or available space. Two studies have been conducted that have shown no obvious, convincing competition between the two species. A study of diets and habitat-use of both species revealed substantial diet overlap only during some seasons, but there were considerable spatial and habitat separations between wi ld horses and bighorns during all seasons (Kissell and others, 1996). This empirical data was then used in a modeling exercise that predicted that neither the current (about 160 horses at the time of the analysis) nor larger numbers of wild horses on the area (e.g., about 200 horses) would result in reduced numbers or condition of bighorn sheep (Coughenour 1999). But competition is a very complex biological process to document. Bighorns might have already been spatially avoiding wild horses when these studies were conducted. A second concern for managers is that earlier studies suggest both species are not using many areas of the range that appear to be suitable (Gudorf and others, 1996; Kissell and others, 1996). A primary goal for the management of both species is to increase their numbers for purposes of genetic conservation and viability. The bighorn sheep population declined during the mid-1990's from a peak of about 211 animals to ~ 100 animals at present. Absolute minimum goals for genetic viability in the bighorn sheep herd (genetic effective population size of N >50) suggest at least 150 animals should be present, while studies of persistence suggest populations of 250+ are e more likely to recover rapidly and persist should the population experience an epizootic die-off (Singer and others, 2001). Since all bighorn sheep populations are potentially vulnerable to disease epizootics, managing for larger populations of 200-300 animals appears to increase the potential for long-term persistence (Berger, 1990; Singer and others, 2001). Wild horses are not prone to rapid disease die-offs. However, minimum goals for genetic viability in the Pryor Mountain wild horses ( Ne > 50) require that at least 160 animals be present on the range (Singer and others, 2000). Since the Ne > 50 goal is set for the breeding of domestic animals, and since the vagaries of drought, severe winters, predation, and other stochastic events cause stress in wild animals, larger goals for Ne (e.g. Ne > 100) for wild horses are even more desirable (USDI, BLM, 1999; Gross, 2000). Expanding the area of the wild horse range is one option, but the prospects for expanding the range do not appear to be great (L. Coates-Markle, BLM, oral comm.). A second option would be to increase the amount of useable habitat for horses on the existing range. One goal of this modeling effort was to use GIS-based habitat analyses to determine the reason wild horses are not using some areas of the range, and to explore the pote ntial for making some of these areas useable. The National Park Service (NPS) has shown considerable interest in management actions within BICA that will increase the range, useable habitat, and population size of bighorn sheep. There has also been interest expressed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and wild horse advocates to improve the useable habitat for wild horses and to possibly incr ease the size of the horse range. Objectives Our objectives were to: 1. Develop separate GIS-based habitat suitability mode ls for bighorn sheep and wild horses for summer and winter ranges based on a unified vegetation coverage created by Gudorf (2002). Our models are based on animal location information gathered over the previous five years. 2. Compare the bighorn sheep habitat suitability model created here, using animal locations, to a more general model completed by Gudorf (2002). 3. Compare modeled habitat to actual animal locations for both species. 4. Create maps of unused bighorn sheep and wild horse habitat. 5. Use the model to identify potential habitat for both species that could be created by: 168 a. Manipulating vegetation types (bighorn sheep) b. Adding water sources and trails (wild horses) c. Opening up the Sorensen extension on NPS lands, and adding U.S. Forest Service (USFS) lands (wild horses) 6. Compare overlap of the tw o species, and compare areas modeled as bighorn sheep habitat to areas modeled as wild horse habitat. Methods Habitat suitability models were developed for two overlapping areas. The bighorn sheep model covered BICA and surrounding areas while the wild horse model covered the PMWHR (Figure 1). Arcview GIS was used to compile a database of several themes of potential importance to these ungulates within those two areas including: 1. Elevation data was obtained from a 30-m resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from the US Geological Survey. 2. Slope was calculated from the 30-m DEM. 3. Aspect was calculated from the 30-m DEM and then cosine transformed to have values from 1 to -1. 4. Canopy cover (used only in the wild horse model) data was derived by Coughenour (1999) from various sources including USGS maps and Knight and others (1987). 5. Vegetation coverage was derived from four sources : BICA vegetation map from Knight and others (1987), Montana GAP, Wyoming Game and Fish vegetation map, and Wyoming GAP. These four maps were merged together using the methods of Gudorf (2002). The finalized vegetation map appears in Figure 2. 6. Distance from water was calculated by using water source data compiled from BICA maps, F. Singer (USGS) and L. Coates-Markle (BLM). Water sources include seasonal springs , water catchments, and tanks. For the purposes of this model, all sources were assumed to be functional except two mid-elevation tanks, which are currently inactive. We modeled a scenario that made these two tanks active and available, as an example of a potential management action. 7. Sheep and horse locations are from summer and winter data. Wild horse locations were acquired from 2 aerial helicopter population surveys/year from 1996-2002 and from ground crew observations (ground tracking) from 1998-2001. Bighorn sheep locations were acquired from aerial helicopter population surveys (1-2/yr) from 1997-2001, and boat surveys, fixed-wing surveys, and systematic ground tracking of 30 radio-collared bighorns from 2000-2002. Summer data was defined as being from April 1-September 30; winter data from October 1-March 31. For wild horses, each data point represents one group of wild horses, where groups ranged in size from one to twelve animals. For sheep, each data point also repres ents one group of animals. To give a portrayal of species overlap, sheep and horse summer locations are displayed in Figure 3, and winter locations are displayed in Figure 4. 8. Distance to escape terrain (used in the bighorn sheep model only) was derived using Arcview by buffering slopes greater than 30 degrees with a 300 m buffer, or buffering with a 1,000 m buffer where slopes were present on two sides (Smith and others, 1991). 9. Initially, the input variable of horizontal visibility for bighorn sheep was obtained from Schoenecker (unpublished data, 2003) as defined in Gudorf (2002). However, because visibility exactly correlated with vegetation (each vegetation type had one singl e visibility rating), th e statistical procedure eliminated visibility in regression analyses. Thus, we did not use visibility per se in our analyses, but it was incorporated into each vegetation type. Therefore, our discussions regarding improving bighorn sheep habitat center on vegetation types and shifting vegetation types to those that are more used by bighorn sheep instead of \"improving visibility\" for sheep. 169 Figure 1. Management boundaries for bighorn sheep and wild horse habitat suitability models in BICA, the PMWHR, and surrounding USFS and state lands in Montana and Wyoming. 170 Figure 2. Final vegetation coverage for the modeling efforts in BICA, the PMWHR, and surrounding USFS and state lands in Montana and Wyoming. 171 Figure 3 . Summer locations of bighorn sheep and wild horses in BICA, the PMWHR, and surrounding USFS and state lands in Montana and Wyoming, 1996-2002. 172 Figure 4 . Management boundaries for bighorn sheep and wild horse habitat suitability models in BICA, the PMWHR, and surrounding USFS and state lands in Montana and Wyoming. 173 Using a GIS-sampling process, sheep and horse locations were overlain on the above geographic grids and pertinent data was sampled for each location. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the best model for predicting habitat selection for each species for both summer and winter seasons. The dichotomous response variable was \"observed habitat use\" versus \"randomly generated\" locations. Akaike's information criteria (AIC) were used to determine the best model for predicting habitat selection for each species and season. The models compared habitat variables for animal-selected areas with those at random locations throughout the range. We used 2,147 summer locat ions and 250 winter locations of wild horses, and 395 summer locations and 223 winter locations of bighorn sheep. The probability of use of a habitat by wild horses and bighorn sheep can be predicted using the following equation: X1i+...KXKiePi are parameter estimates in the logistic regression equation, and X1 ...X are the values of the i Ki habitat variables (van Manen and Pelton, 1997). This model can then be used to create management scenarios by varying the above GIS input coverages. Scenarios can be tested by changing the habitat variables (adding a water source or changing access), re-running the equation and comp aring the outcome to the ba se model. In the figures and results that follow, four categories were used to de fine habitat suitability \u2014 suita ble, acceptable, marginal, and unsuitable. \"Suitable\" was de fined as having a probability of use betw een 0.75 and 1.0, \"acceptable\" was between 0.50 and 0.75, \"marginal\" between 0.25 and 0.50, and less than 0.25 was \"unsuitable.\" Areas that were modeled suitable or acceptable habitat were defined as \"favorable\" habitats. In addition to the multiple logistic regression which creates the mapped probability values, we also performed single variable logistic regression. These regre ssions help tease out the details in multiple models. For example, while the multiple model will display the best combined model, it is not likely to be feasible for managers to manipulate multiple variables, especially those that are constant, like elevation, slope, aspect, and distance to escape terrain. Distance to water, vegetation, and can opy cover, on the other hand, are manipulatable, and the single variable logistic regression displays where managers might get the most effect for a given manipulation . A higher coefficient value suggests a highe r importance, or benefit, to manipulation of that variable. Results and Discussi on for Bighorn Sheep Summer Habitat Suitability Model Bighorn sheep locations in summer (Figure 3) were clustered near the edge of Bighorn Canyon primarily near the lower end of the Park but also scattered alon g the canyon edge upwards towards the north. The summer bighorn sheep model coefficients derived by the multiple logi stic regression appear in Table 1. Four variables \u2014 slope, elevation, distance to escape terrain, and vegetation \u2014 were significant in the model. In the combined model with these four variables, sheep preferred steeper slopes, lower elevations, and closeness to escape terrain. In the vegetation categories, sagebrush was held as the constant variable while all other categories were compared to it. Assigning sagebrush as the constant variable was random and had no meaning. Any variable could have equally been the constant. Positive and negative effects on the mode l are only in comparison to sagebrush in this case, and may not be negative overall. In this comparison, the category mountain-mahogany/juniper had the highest positive effect, with riparian, juniper, and grassland also having positive effects on the model. Forest and mixed shrub had negative effects on the model comp ared to sagebrush (Table 1). Figure 5 depicts the habitat suitability map for bighorn sheep in the summer. As per the quantitative model results in Table 1, the map shows darker areas where suitab ility is highest. These darker areas spatially coincide with the variables in the Table 1. Darker areas are primarily stee per slopes, at lower elevations , that are close to escape terrain, and primarily in the vegetation types of mountain-mahogany/juniper, riparian, juniper, and grassland. Any habitat manipulations that increased these four favorable vegetation types in areas located in proximity to the three favorable variables that are fixed (on steep slopes, at low elevations, close to escape terrain) would likely increase 174 the amount and area of suitable summer bighorn sheep habitat. Additionally, Figure 5 allows us to find areas that are under-utilized by the current distribution of bighorn sheep. Sheep locations are depicted by red dots, so black areas that occur without nearby red dots can be interpreted as underutilized habitat. Table 1. Multiple logistic output for bighorn sheep and wild horse, summer and winter models. Bighorn Sheep Wild Horses Summer Winter Summer Winter Intercept 2.0906 3.1937 -3.8975 Open Water n/a 0.0 0.0 Table 2 allows us to see how well the model fits the currently mapped sheep locations. There were a total of 395 summer sheep observations. Of those 395, 160 fell into areas modeled as \"acceptable\" and 161 fell into areas modeled as \"suitable\". In total, 322 of the 395 observ ations \u2014 81.3% \u2014 were in areas with favorable modeled suitability. This is somewhat to be expected, since loca tions were used to build the model. Only 73 (18.7%) locations were in habitat modeled as less favorable. A true test of our model would be to take an independent set of locations (not those used to build the model) and test them in the model. We also note that our model does not make statements or predictions about areas that are modeled suitable bighorn sheep habitat where there are no bighorn sheep locations. We do not know why sheep do not appear to be using these areas. We suggest additional fieldwork and investigations with more statistical evaluations to answer that question. Winter Habitat Suitability Model Much like the summer locatio ns, bighorn sheep are clustered near the edge of Bighorn Canyon primarily near the lower end of the Park but also scattered alon g the canyon edge upwards towards the north in winter (Figure 4). Winter model results also appear in Table 1. On ly three variables \u2014 elevation, distance to escape terrain, and vegetation \u2014 were significant in the model. In the combined model with these thr ee variables, sheep preferred lower elevations, and closeness to escape terrain. In the vegetation categories, again, sagebrush was held as the 175 Figure 5. Bighorn sheep summer habitat suitability ratings with sheep locations. Dark colored areas that do not contain red dots represent unused, but favorable (suitable plus acceptable) habitat. 176 Table 2. Percent of bighorn sheep observations found in suitable and acceptable bighorn sheep habitat in both models for BICA and surrounding lands . Bighorn Sheep Model Criteria Number of Number of observations in observations in Percent of observations in suitable acceptable Total observations suitable or acceptable Summer (Animal 161 160 395 81.3 Location-Based Model) Winter (Animal 100 85 222 83.3 Location-Based Model) Summer 82 395 20.8 (Intermountain- West Model) Winter 39 222 17.6 (Intermountain- West Model) constant variable while all other categories were compared to it. In this comparison, the category named mountain- mahogany/juniper had the highest positive effect, with juniper, riparian, and grassland also having positive effects. Forest and mixed shrub had negative effects compared to sagebrush, and thus they are considered less favorable habitat for bighorn sheep than sagebrush and the four types with positive effects. Figure 6 depicts the habitat suitability map for bighorn sheep in the winter. As per the quantitative model results in Table 1, the map shows darker areas where suitability is highest which spatially coincide with variables listed in Table 1. Darker areas are primarily at lower elevatio ns that are close to escape terrain, and primarily in the vegetation types of mountain-mahogany/juniper, riparian, juniper, and grassland. Any habitat manipulations which increased these four favorable vegetation types while being in proximity to the other two favorable variables (lower elevations and close to escape terrain ) would likely increase the area of suitable winter bighorn sheep habitat. Additionally, Figure 6 allows us to find areas that are underutilized by the current distribution of bighorn sheep. Sheep locations are depicted by red dots. Black areas that occur without nearby red dots can be interpreted as underutilized habitat. These areas have the ability to suppor t animals but our model does not address why animals do not appear to be found there. Table 2 allows us to see how well the model fits the currently mapped sheep locations. There were a total of 222 winter sheep observations. Of those 222, 85 fell into areas modele d as \"acceptable\" and 100 fell into areas modeled as \"suitable.\" In total then, 185 of the 222 obse rvations \u2014 83.3% \u2014 were in areas with favorable modeled suitability. Thirty-seven observations (16.7%) were in areas rated as less favorable in the model. Comparison of the Animal Location-Based Model with the Intermountain West Generic Model We compared the animal location-based model described in this report to another bighorn sheep habitat suitability model, developed by Smith and others (1991) and Gudorf (2002). The Smith and others (1991) model is a broad-based intermountain-west model, covering several states. Gudorf (2002) modified Smith and others (1991) to create a model specific to BICA. The anim al location-based bighorn sheep habitat suitability model (this report) is a modification of van Manen and Pelton (1997). Figure 7 and Figure 8 compare bighorn sheep model suitability as predicted by the two different models for both summer and winter, respectively. In the figures, red hatched areas are predicted as suitable by the Intermountain-West Model, while black areas are predicted as suitable by the Animal Location-Based Model. 177 Figure 6. Bighorn sheep winter habitat suitability ratings with sheep locations. Dark colored areas that do not contain red dots represent unused , but favorable (suitable plus acce ptable ) habitat. 178 Figure 7. Bighorn sheep summer habitat suitability ratings compared for the Animal Location-Based (ALB) model and the Intermountain West model. 179 Figure 8. Bighorn sheep winter habitat suitability ratings compared fo r the Animal Location-Based (ALB) model and Intermountain West model. 180 The Intermountain-West Model operates quite differently than the Animal Location-Based Model. Whereas the Animal Location-Based Model uses actual sheep locations to predict suitability, the Intermountain-West Model does not use sheep locations, and uses a progressive reduction process as outlined in Gudorf (2002). This \"progressive reduction\" involves a process of eliminatio n, where land area is systematically removed from consideration if it does not meet specific criteria for bighorn sheep habita t; criteria obtained from the literature. Remaining land areas may be considered suitable bighorn sheep habitat. Patches of habitat deemed suitable must be of sufficient size to sustain a viable population or must occur in proximity, so that the combined area would support a viable metapopulation. This progressive reduction process was originally developed as a more generalized range-wide model, then refined by using sheep locations at other bighorn habitats in Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado, and finally, adapted to the BICA by Gudorf and others (1996) and Gudorf (2002). There are two primary differences in the models that account for the discrepancies in Figures 7 and 8. The first discrepancy exists along Bighorn Canyon where the Animal Location-Based Model predicts large areas of suitable habitat while the Intermountain-West Model predicts much smaller, patchier suitability. This is due to the use of horizontal visibility as a variable in the Intermount ain-West Model, which removes vegetation types that have a horizontal visibility for bighorn sheep lower than 62%. Horizontal visibility is the percent of area within a set distance that sheep can see without obstruction to detect predators and is a key requirement for bighorn sheep habitat, since bighorn sheep rely primarily on sight to detect predators. Several studies have tried to quantify and test the horizontal visibility requirements fo r bighorn sheep (Table 3). The visibilit y rating for each vegetation type in BICA was measured using methods of Johnson and Swift (1995) and used by Gudorf (2002) for her analysis. One of the vegetation types in the Knight and others (1987) vegetation map, \"juniper-mountain mahogany woodland,\" had a visibility rating of 55% and was thus removed from suitability in the Intermountain-West Model. In comparing the Animal Location-Based and Intermountain-West Models, larg e areas of this vegetation ty pe exist along the canyon in BICA, especially nearer to the so uthern end. These areas are included in the Animal Location-Based Model but excluded in the Interm ountain-West Model. The second difference exists around the northern and eastern sides of the wild horse range where the Intermountain-West Model includes large areas that are no t included in the Animal Location-Based Model. These areas are included in the Intermountai n-West Model because its criteria find these areas close enough to escape terrain and water sources while also having adequate visibility. The Animal Location-Based Model, however, does not include these areas because the vege tation categories were not preferred, di stance to escape terrain was too far, and elevations too high. Table 3. Primary sources of information on horizontal visibility for suitable habitat for bighorn sheep. Source Smith and others (1991) Johnson and Swift (2000) Description Original study that developed methodology for determining horizontal visibility for bighorn sheep in the field.

Bailey (1990) Risenhoover and Bailey (1985) Risenhoover and others (1988) Management of bighorn sheep herds in Colorado. Tests visibility and makes recommendations for opening up habitats in all 3 studies. A comparison of the Animal Location-Based and In termountain-West Models for the BICA summer and winter habitat appears in Table 2. Of the 395 summer obse rvations, 82, or 20.8%, fell into the areas predicted as \"suitable\" in the Intermountain-West Model, and of the 222 winter observations, 39, or 17.6%, fell into areas predicted as \"suitable\" in the Intermountain-West Model. Bo th models have utility. A generic model for a 3-state 181 area is very useful and applicable in that setting, while an animal location-based model may be more useful to a specific herd, as in this case. Bighorn Sheep Habitat Use In order to test whether bighorn sheep were using habitat types in proportion to their availability (Table 4a,b), we used a chi-square test following Neu and others (1974) and Byers and others (1984). We found that the expected number of bighorn sheep groups using various habitat types differed significantly (P < 0.0001) from the observed number of bighorn sheep groups using different vegetation types in both winter and summer. We examined several comparisons between observed and expected occurrence of bighorn sheep groups in order to detect preference or avoidance of specific habitat types (N eu and others, 1974; Table 4a,b). When we evaluated each habitat type, we found that in summer, mixed shrub, sagebrush, juniper, and forest habitat types are used less than expected based on available habitat, while mountain mahogany and riparian areas were used more than expected based on available habitat (Table 4a). Bighorn sheep appear to be using grassland habitats in summer proportional to its availability. This suggests that bighorn sheep in BI CA are selecting mountain mahogany habitats and riparian areas over other habitats as a preferred habitat types in summer. In winter (Table 4b), bighorn sheep used mixed shrub, sagebrush, grassland, and forest habitat types less than their availability. As in summer, sheep used mountai n mahogany and riparian areas more than expected based on available habitat. In winter they used juniper habitat in proportion to its availability, unlike summer when they used it less than its availability, suggesting juniper is a habitat type they rely upon to get through winter months. Our findings suggest that bighorn sheep in BICA prefer mountain mahogany in both winter and summer over other types. This is also somewhat inconsistent with other studies that have found that bighorn sheep prefer sagebrush habitats over other vegetation types. It may be th at much of the sage habitat in the park and surrounding lands is too far from escape terrain or has other negative factors that preclude bighorns from selecting it. Bighorn Sheep Habitat Improvement Scenarios Bighorn sheep summer habitat factors include, slop e, and distance to escape terrain, elevation, and vegetation. The first three of these factors are fixed geophysical features that cannot be manipulated by managers. The fourth, vegetation, can be changed using various means including burning, clearing, planting, reseeding, etc. From Table 1, we see that mountain mahogany/juniper has the highest quantitative effect in the regression equation. The quantitative results in Table 1 can be ranked according to the de gree of effect the change in vegetation type would have on habitat suitability. Table 5 ranks the vegetation types in three levels. Mountain mahogany/juniper, all riparian, juniper, and all grassland have the highest values and receive the highest rank. Sagebrush and mixed shrub have similar but lower values and are ranked second. All forested has the lowest value and rank. As an example of treatable areas, Figure 9a depi cts map-cells that are not already \"Suitable\" or \"Acceptable\" in summer bu t could become so if treatments occurred. Ar eas in Figure 9a that are color-coded are close enough to escape terrain, have adequate slopes, and low enough elevations to become suitable given vegetation treatments. The four color-coded vegetation types in Figure 9a are juniper, sagebrush, mixed shrub, and all forested. The same methods were used to create Figure 9b, which depicts areas in winter which could become suitable given vegetation treatments. Although the ranking in Table 5 provides general information derived from the logistic regression model, specific recommendations for treatments come from additional sources beyond the model (Table 6). Recommended treatments and the management priority of those treatments are described in Table 6 and the text that follows. 182 c Table 4.

Vegetation types and locations that could become suitabl e or acceptable winter bighorn sheep habitat if treatments occurred. Treatments might include cl earing, burning, reseeding, etc. 185 Table 5. Suitability rank for vegetation manipulations for bighorn sheep. Rank Vegetation type 1. (high) Mountain Mahogany/Juniper All Riparian Juniper All Grassland 2. (medium) Sagebrush Mixed Shrub 3. (low) All Forested Of the vegetation types in Table 6 that could be treated and yield a benefit to bighorns, several deserve greater discussion: Mountain Mahogany \u2014 Burning of mature mountain mahogany stands may provide some benefits to bighorn sheep even though mature patches are already a preferred type. Mountain mahogany is not dependent on fire, and seedlings will germinate around a mature canopy, although mountain mahogany typically resprouts strongly following burning. In one study, only 25% of the plants died following burning and the shrubs showed an increase in production following the fire (Cook and others, 1994). The stands would be opened up for a few years and the herbaceous understory might increase in forage quality (Cook and others, 1994). In a few cases, more mountain mahogany plants died following burning (Arno and others, 1986). We recommend the burning of pure mountain mahogany stands as a low priority, since the stands will not increase in area, and seedlings can already germinate u nder mature shrubs. However, burning of mixed mountain mahogany-juniper is a moderate priority for bighorn sheep \u2014 substantial areas of a preferred type could be opened up. Because burning effects are variable from area to area, we suggest an experimental approach. Juniper Woodland \u2014 The highest priority for park management is the burning or clearing of select dense juniper patches. Some open juniper patches are already hi ghly suitable habitat. However, the more dense patches will not be used. These could be burned or cleared and very substantial amounts of newly suitable habitat could be created. Managers could identify those st ands that would benefit by treatment, characterized by areas of horizontal visibility <62% (Johnson and Swift, 2000). Treatment effects will be quite long-lived and thus should be a high priority. These same statements will apply to xeric open forest stands. Sagebrush Steppe \u2014 Bighorn sheep habitat could be increased considerably by the burning or clearing of tall, dense big sagebrush. Big sagebrush does not resprout an d is readily killed by fire (Blaisdell, 1953). The patch is opened up and grass and forb forages may increase (Perryman and others, 2002). Burning may reduce the sagebrush canopy for more than 16 years, and take 25-30 years to re-establish pre-burn conditions (Wambolt and others, 2001). Thus, treatment effects ar e only of moderate duration. Grassland \u2014 Low priority for treatment. The habitat is already open and suitable for bighorn sheep. A flush of nutrients and increased biomass from the burning may be desirable, but short-lived \u2014 typically only 2-3 years duration. Mixed Shrub \u2014 The benefits from burning will be similar to that for sagebrush steppe. These stands are typically denser. The big sagebrush and bitterbrush will be reduced by burning, opened up, and forages benefited. Some of the bitterbrush will resprout (Blaisdell and Mueggl er, 1956; Clark and others, 1982), and will then reseed onto the site, over a period of a few years (Daubenmire and Daubenmire, 1968). Again, there is very little of this type on the BICA study area in areas that have other habitat attributes for bighorn sheep, so there is little potential for management. 186 Table 6. Burning treatments to conduct in BICA and surrounding l ands, Wyoming and Montana, to improve habitat for bighorn sheep. Treatments should only occur in vegetat ion types where criteria of slope, aspect and elevation are suitable, since these criteria are fixed and can not be modified (Figure 9).

Medium Grassland Grassl and Low Low Grassland Some very short term Hobbs benefits to forage and biomass and quality Spowart could occur. (1984) Based on habitat suitability ratings of the Animal Location-Based model (this report). Caveats to Burning Treatments - We suggest keeping the following things in mind regarding the feasibility of burning treatments. Some drier types may not be burnable due to lack of fuel. Burning off dominant woody plants, such as mountain mahogany may be inadvisable. It takes a long time to grow mountain mahogany in those habitats, and in fact those habitats are better adapted for mountain mahogany than grass, which would be unl ikely to replace it. Moreover, mountain mahogany is a primary diet item for bighorn sheep in this herd. In mesic dense forest, new conifers may not rapidly reseed onto the site after burning, and grass may not grow in some of those habitats due to poor soils. Soil sampling and/or analysis by a range ecologist is recommended before any burning treatments occur. In many of the vegetation types, thinning to improve visibility will yield benefits to bighorns. Several studies (summarized in Table 3) have documented the effect that visibility has on bighorn behavior and habitat. Given this research and the goals of BICA to increase bighorn habitat, locating and thinning dense vegetation in stands of mountain mahogany, juniper, sagebrush, and riparian areas will likely increase habitat. Work by Schoenecker and others (2004) showed that visibility is di fferent even within the same vegetation types in different 188 parts of the bighorn sheep range in Bighorn Canyon. Therefore, we recommend more field work to determine which specific areas should be treated by thinning. The fact that one visibility rating was used in our model for each vegetation type across the entire study area, even though multiple visibility ratings are occurring within the same vegetation type, is a problem that can be addressed only by considerable field meas urements. Once this data is available, our model can be modified to incorporate a more precise representation of horizontal visibility. Results and Discussi on for Wild Horses Current Summer Habitat Selections and Distributions of Wild Horses In summer, wild horses are clustered at the north end of the range in areas predominated by grassland and riparian vegetation, and also clustered along the eastern edge of the range nearer to Bighorn Canyon (Figure 3). Summer model results are given in Tables 1 and 7. In the summer model, all variables \u2014 vegetation, canopy cover, elevation, slope, aspect, and distance to water \u2014 were significant in the multiple logistic equation. Horses preferred higher elevations, areas closer to water sources, flatter slopes, southerly facing aspects, more open forest canopies, and open non-forest vegetation types (non-forested, grassland and shrubs). Habitat manipulations which increase water availability in non-forested areas would likely increase the amount of suitable habitat for wild horses. As suggested by the single variable regression output in Table 7, habitat manipulations which increased the amount of useable grassland and riparian vegetation would have the largest effect. Figure 10 depicts the habitat suitability map for wild horses in summer. As per the quantitative model results in Table 1, the map shows darker areas where suitability is highest which spatially coincide with variables listed in Table 1. Additionally, Figure 10 allows us to find areas that are underutilized by the current distribution of wild horses. Horse locations are depicted by red dots. Bl ack areas that occur withou t nearby red dots can be interpreted as underutilized habitat. Table 7.

Wild horse summer habitat suitability ratings with horse loca tions. Dark colored areas that do not contain dots represent unused, but favorable (suitable plus acceptable) habitat. Area 1 is the north unit, area 2 is the west unit, and area 3 is the central unit. 190 Table 8 allows us to see how well the model fits th e currently mapped wild horse locations. There were a total of 2150 summer wild hor se observations. Of those 2150, 277 fell into areas mo deled as \"acceptable\" and 1374 fell into areas modeled as \"suitable.\" In total then, 1651 of the 2150 observations (76.8%) were in areas with favorable modeled suitability (suitable plus acceptable). Current Winter Habitat Selections and Distributions of Wild Horses Winter wild horse locations appear in Figure 4, and depict a very even distribution of animals throughout the lower portion of the range. Winter model results are given in Tables 1 an d 7. In the winter model, while all variables except aspect are significant, only three variables offer large num eric effects in the model \u2014 slope, vegetation, and canopy. Wintering wild horses prefer flatter slopes, more open forest canopies, and riparian vegetation. Habitat manipulations which decrease canopy cover and increase riparian vegetation would likely increase suitability for wild horses. Figure 11 depicts the habitat suitability map for wild horses in the winter. As per the quantitative model results in Table 1, the map shows darker areas where suitability is highest which spatially coincide with variables listed in Table 1. Additionally, Figure 11 depicts areas that are underutilized by the current distribution of wild horses, since dark areas that occur without nearby red dots can be in terpreted as underutilized but otherwise potentially favorable habitat. Table 8 shows how well the model fits the currently mapp ed wild horse locations. There were a total of 250 winter wild horse observations. Of those 250, 125 fell into areas modele d as \"acceptable\" and 33 fell into areas modeled as \"suitable.\" In total then, 151 of the 250 observations (63.2%) were in areas with favorable modeled suitability. Wild horses use low elevation, drier habitats during winter. Water is much less limiting in winter since they eat snow, and there are five known low- elevation water sources. Thus, wild ho rses are able to use much of the badlands, shrub, and dry grassland habitats that could not be used during summer due to the lack of water. Water alone, however, probably does not explain the movement of most of the population to the high elevation, mountain top, sub-alpine grasslands during summer. Nitrogen concentrations of these mountain top grasslands were as high as 3.4%, while low elevation grasses tend to average 0.5 to 1.0% during summer (Peterson, 1999). There are clearly nutritional advantages for the horses to forage in the high-e levation grasslands for as long into the winter as feasible, until snow drives them to lower and mid-elevations. Potential Habitats that are Unused or Little-Used by Wild Horses-Habitat Improvement Scenarios We identified three areas that were either totally unused or only lightly-used by wild horses: (1) a north unit, (2) a west unit, and (3) a central unit (labeled 1, 2, and 3 on Figure 10). The north unit is the largest (7.4 km 2) of these areas and it does support occasional use by wild horses. It might be possible to create an access trail around this cliff, but much of the north unit is already accessible. About three-fourths of the unit was rated as unsuitable or marginal habitat (it has north and east exposures and further distances to water) and we su spect this explains why the area receives only minimal use. The north unit contains 0.1 km2 of \"suitable\" and 1.1 km2 of \"acceptable\" summer habitat (Table 9). Table 8. How well the models fit the actual observations.

There is only one known potential crossing of a steep canyon to this area, and old horse trails suggest some wild horses knew of this crossing and used the area in the early 1990's. This abandoned trail could possibly be improved, or wild horses may rediscover the trail and once again use th e area (there was evidence on the Nov. 2001 flight of renewed activity on the east end of the crossing trail). However, the unit contains very little high quality summer habitat \u2014 0.0 km 2 of \"suitable\" and 0.1 km2 of \"acceptable\" summer habitat (Table 9). But if the habitat was treated and the trail improved, it may open up new habitat for wild horses. The central unit is very small (about 0.1 km2) and is the middle portion of the Big Coulee Canyon. Wild horses use most of this canyon and there are many ingress and egress trails between th e canyon and the adjacent ridges and rolling grass/juniper habitats to the east. The vast majority of the Big Coulee Canyon is already highly available to wild horses. The central unit contains no \"suitable\" or \"acceptable\" su mmer habitat (Table 9). Potential Additions of New Ar eas to the Wild Horse Range As a demonstration model, two areas that are not currently part of the existing wild horse range were assessed using the wild horse habitat suitability mo del (Figure 10). The northwest area covers 25 km2 and receives trespass use by wild horses that cross through the buck-and-pole fence that forms the western boundary of the wild horse range. Cattle fences and st eep canyons prohibit ho rses from using the rest of the area. The areas that receive some use are Tony's Island, Big Ice Cave, Dry Head Vista, and west of Dry Head Vista. Commissary Ridge and west of Big Ice Cave are not generally accessible to wild ho rses due to good four-stran d cattle fences, although even here an occasional harem finds its way around the fence and can be found on Commissa ry Ridge. The area that receives use contains 9.3 km 2 of \"acceptable\" and 11.8 km2 of \"suitable\" summer habitat (Table 9). Wild horses can also make some use of this northwest area in the winter by confining their grazing to th e windswept ridges just west of the Dryhead Vista, on Commissary Ridge, or on Tony's Island. A second potential addition, the Sorenson Area, is part of the BICA. Although the area is not officially part of the PMWHR, the area was used by wild horses for te n years under a temporary ag reement between the BLM and the NPS. Wild horses have not used the area since 1992 (Pet erson, 1999). The Sorenson Area contains 7.0 km2 of favorable wild horse summer range (6.9 km2 - acceptable, 0.1 km2 - suitable), and 6.4 km2 of favorable horse winter range (Table 7). Current underutilized habitat on the wild horse range is shown in Figure 11. 193 New Water Sources Again for purposes of demonstration only, we modeled a scenario which added new water sources at mid- elevations on the horse range (Figure 12). Two nonfunctional water sources, if made functional again, would add 7.7 km2 of acceptable and 0.7 km2 of suitable summer habitat to the amount already available in summer (Table 9). However, many of these same mid-elevation areas are al ready high quality winter range, and encouraging summer forage utilization near the hypothetical new water sources might remove or decrease some badly needed winter forage. Prescribed Burnin g and Clearing The conversion of conifer forest or shrubland into a high elevation or mid-elevation grassland would clearly create new summer habitat for wild horses. Grassland fires can also temporarily increase production and forage quality of the grasses for horses (Rowland and othe rs, 1983; Canon and others, 1987). Burning existing open grassland could be used as a technique to better distribute horses across the entire landscape as they are attracted to the new burns. However, burning or clearing may also result in no positive or even a negative effect on forages. For example, prescribed burning does not always increase pr oduction or forage quality (Hobbs and Spowart, 1984; Singer and others, 2004). Additionally, converting existing forest to a stand of young tree seedlings, or to a forb community, would have little benefit to the wild horses. As one example, the clearcuts located near Big Ice Cave that have a high forb com ponent and many conifer saplin gs have receive d almost no use by wild horses over the years of this study (the single exception is one harem that has used the clearcuts). Projecting a burning/clearing scenario was beyond the scope of this project. We had insufficient information to predict what plant communities would result fo llowing treatment of conifer stands at various slopes, elevations, and aspects. The habitat model, however, might be used for these future projections if more information on fire effects was available. Overlap of Bighor n Sheep and Wild Horse Habitats Managers desire to increase the amoun t of bighorn sheep habitat in order to increase the viability of the species in and around BICA. Questions have arisen about whether wild hors es and bighorn sheep compete for the same habitat, and to what extent, if at all, wild hors es may out-compete bighorn sheep and thus restrict bighorn sheep viability across the BICA. Thus, the overlap of the two species is of interest to managers. Figures 13 and 14 are generalized overlap maps for actual sheep and horse locat ions for both summer and winter. Animal locations were buffered with a 300 m pol ygon and intersected to create areas of overlap. During the summer there is signifi cant overlap near the eastern, lower edge of the horse range and a few hot spots across the middle of the horse range. During winter, the overlap is sprinkled throughout the middle of the horse range. A visual inspection of the areas of overlap does not yield any conc lusive variables in common to both species' selected habitats. Due to the arbitrary assignment of polygon size and other subjective factors, we do not recommend a statistical analysis of the overlap vers us non-overlap areas. Local managers can likely use these maps to tease out the differences, if any, that exist be tween overlap and non-overlap areas. Figures 15 and 16 attempt to graphical display modeled overlap by depicting the areas that summer and winter models predict as \"suitable\" or \"acceptable\" by both species. The dark cells on the map are areas where the models predict that necessary habitat exists for both speci es. Significant overlap occurs in the modeled habitats in roughly the same places as the actual observations in Figures 13 and 14. A possible future use of the model could be to manipulate vegetation types so that bighorn habitat could be increased while horse habitat remained the same. This procedure might involve identifying areas near adequate sheep escape terrain where vegetation could be either clear ed/burned or planted with certain sheep-preferred species. This project would be quite complex, and would involve significant manipulations as well as continual monitoring to make sure changes vegetation species composition were occurring as predicted. 194 Figure 12. Wild horse summer habitat suitability ratings with additional wate r sources. Area 1 is the north unit, area 2 is the west unit, and area 3 is the central unit. 195 Figure 13. Areas of summer overlap between wild horses and bighorn sheep. Blue areas represent overlap. 196 Figure 14. Areas of winter overlap between wild horse s and bighorn sheep. Blue areas represent overlap. 197 Figure 15. Areas in summer where bighorn suitability and wild horse su itability are \"acceptable\" or \"suitable\" for both species. 198 Figure 16. Areas in winter where bighorn suitability and wild horse suitability are \"acceptable\" or \"sui table\" for both species. 199 Additionally, the current available data for bighorn sheep and wild horse locations was obtained over several years and under several varying sampling regimens. For example, horse and sheep locations were obtained on different dates and by varying methods, and so species overlap can only be broadly estimated as having occurred in the same season of the year. In order to properly account for species overlap, an intense field investigation which covered the entire range of both species on the same dates would yi eld a truly accurate sample to answer these important questions. Conclusions 1. There is considerable unused winter and summer habitat for bighorn sheep north of the currently occupied area, along the Bighorn River canyon and in Devil's Canyon. Areas south of the currently occupied area were not highly suitable. Suitable sheep habitat in Crooked Creek was limited, and suitable habitat in West Pryor was very limited. 2. There was considerable favorable unused summer habita t for wild horses, especi ally in areas northwest of the Range on national forest and in the Sorenson extension. 3. There is little favorable unused winter habitat for wild horses across the range. Most unused favorable winter habitat was in area 2 and in the Sorenson extension. 4. All four of the suitability models based on animal locations presented here were successful and predicted most of the areas used by either bighorn sheep or wild horses. Considering some observations were of animals moving between suitable habitats, we rate both models as highly successful. The Intermountain-West model was consid erably less successful than the Animal Location- Based model in predicting areas used by bighorn sheep. 5. Areas of overlap between bighorn sheep and wild horses exist in specific areas across the middle portion of the horse range. Further studies into the locations and consequences of this overlap are warranted but beyond the scope of this initial project. 6. This habitat suitability analysis suggests the following management actions would reap the most benefits to both species: Bighorn Sheep Translocate or encourage bighorn sheep dispersal into the northern end of Bighorn Lake, Devil's Canyon, and south Bighorn Lake areas. Use clearing or burning to create additiona l habitat focusing on the following areas: - Areas closer to the Bighorn Lake and Canyon, or the deep Crooked Creek Canyon as depicted in Figure 9. - Areas that add useable clusters of suitable habitat that can support new nursery bands of ewes/lambs/sub-adults (i.e., as opposed to small isolated patches). - Consider connecting habitats and creating new patches in a leap-frog fashion. - The Big Coulee, West Pryor, and the northwest pe riphery of the study area are low priorities for improvements. By focusing on the vegetation types of juniper, sagebrush, and mixed shrub, the greatest amount of suitable habitat might be created. Juniper could be cleared to create better visibility, while thinning, burning, or clearing of shrubs might also create more favorable habitat. Wild Horses Summer range: adding the northwest USFS section, adding water holes expeditiously, clearing key forested habitats, and adding the Sorenson extension would yield the most benefits. Winter range: clear key forested habitats, encourag e use of the western PMWHR (area 2), and add the Sorenson extension to increase wild horse habitat. 200 Literature Cited Arno, S.F., and Wilson, A.E., 1986, Dating past fires in cur lleaf mountain-mahogany communities.: Journal of Range Management, v. 39, no. 3, p. 241-243.
