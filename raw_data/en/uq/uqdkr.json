It embodies the Four Directions, as well as Father Sky, Mother Earth, and Spirit Tree\u2014all of which symbolize dimensions of health and the cycles of life. The Medicine Wheel can take many different forms. It can be an artwork such as artifact or painting, or it can be a physical construction on the land. Hundreds or even thousands of Medicine Wheels have been built on Native lands in North America over the last several centuries. Movement in the Medicine Wheel and in Native American ceremonies is circular, and typically in a clockwise, or \"sun-wise\" direction. This helps to align with the forces of Nature, such as gravity and the rising and setting of the Sun. Meanings of the Four Directions Different tribes interpret the Medicine Wheel differently. Each of the Four Directions (East, South, West, and North) is typically represented by a distinctive color, such as black, red, yellow, and white, which for some stands for the human races. The Directions can also represent: - Stages of life: birth, youth, adult (or elder), death - Seasons of the year: spring, summer, winter, fall - Aspects of life: spiritual, emotional, intellectual, physical - Elements of nature: fire (or sun), air, water, and earth - Animals: Eagle, Bear, Wolf, Buffalo and many others - Ceremonial plants: tobacco, sweet grass, sage, cedar "}
