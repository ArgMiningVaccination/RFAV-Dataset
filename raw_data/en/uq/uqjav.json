Progress has been made, for exam ple, in sm oking reduction, infectious disease, and m otor vehicle and workplace injuries. Besides i ts focus on traditional concerns such as clean water and safe food, public health is adapting to m eet emerging health prob lems. Particular ly troublesome are health threats to youth: teenage pregnancies, violence, substance abuse, sexually trans mitted diseases, and other conditions associat ed with high-risk behaviors. These threats add to burgeoning health care c osts. A conservative estimate of $69 billion in medical sp ending could be averted through the im pact of public health strategies aimed at heart disease, str oke, f atal and nonf atal occupational injuries, motor vehicle-relate d injuries, low birt h weight, and violence. These strat egies require the collaboration of many groups in the public and private sectors. Collaboration is the bedrock of p ublic he alth and Health y Iowans pl anning. At th e core of Healthy Iowans 20 00 and its succes sor, Healthy Iowans 20 10, is the idea that all Iowans benefit when stakeholders decide on dis ease preventi on and health prom otion strategies and a gree to work together on them. These strategies can improve the quality of life and hold down health care costs. The payoff for health prom otion and disease prevention is not immediate, but it ha s long-lasting benefits. The Iowa plan is a com panion to the national plan, Healthy People 2010 . An ini tiative to im prove the health of Americans, the national plan is the dr iving force for federal resource al location for diseas e prevention and health prom otion. The state plan is u sed in the same way . Both plans have received broad support from Republican and Dem ocratic ad ministrations . Comm unity plan ners are using the state plan to help assess health needs and craft health im prove ment plans. Healthy Iowans 201 0 was written at an unusual point in histor y - a new decade, a new centur y, a new millennium . The introduction was opti mistic. \"The 21st century ,\" it say s, \"promise s to add life as well as years throu gh improved health habits coupled with m edical advances. Scientists have suggested that if these changes occur, the de finition of adulthood will also change. An extraordinary num ber of people will live fuller, m ore active lives beyond that expected in the late 20th century .\" A t the sam e time, the countr y has spawned a new generation of health hazar ds. According to Dr. Wi lliam Diet z of the Centers for Diseas e Control and Prevention (CDC), it has repl aced \"the dis eases of defic iency with diseas es of excess \" (Newsweek, August 2, 1999). New threats, su ch as childhood overweight, can reverse progress made in the last century . This demands concerted act ion. April 2005 Introduc tion - Page 1 of 5 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Introduction Broad Grassroots Input and Support for the State Health Plan Published in 2000 , Iowa's action plan, Healthy Iowans 201 0, was a product of 550 Iowans working in teams. The Iowa Department of Publ ic Health was th e lead agency. In 2 004, another 42 5 peo ple used the outcom es of the first four years of im plementation to update Healthy Iowans 20 10. Private, publi c and non- profit organizations and ag ency representatives not onl y developed the plan, they also were asked for a co mmitment to action. Eve ry action step in Healthy Io wans 201 0 is supported by an or ganization that has agreed to take that st ep. In this way, responsibilit y for achieving goals is shared by the groups drafti ng the plan and u pdating it. A tracking system , an integral part of implem entati on, assures accountabilit y. Each y ear, organizations and agencies committed to taking action will be asked to m ake an assessment of progress. Examples of Accomplishments \u00be Major im provem ents in mortality rates for cancer, the second leading cause of death in Iowa, have occurred. Sin ce 1994-19 96, fem ale breast and prostate cancers, the most common cancers in wo men and m en, im proved b y 17% and 19% respectively . For prostate, oral cavity and phar ynx, and skin melano ma, the original 20 10 goals have already been achieved. \u00be Childhood le ad poisoni ng is a concern in Iowa. Ma ny hom es in the state were b uilt before 1950 when lead-based paint was co mmon. An esti mated 13% of Iowa' s children under age 6 were lead poisoned for the period 1992-199 8. The m ost recent figures s how that 9.4% of Iowa's chil dren under ag e 6 are lead poisoned . \u00be Surve ys by the Iowa Youth Behavioral Risk Surve y showed that students in grad es 9-12 who a re sexually active remained at 43% between 1997 and 2001. Adol escent pregnancies am ong females aged 15 to 17 decreased from 26 per 1,0 00 in 2000 to 21.6 i n 2003. For females aged 12 to 14, the number of pregnancies dec reased fro m 91 in 2000 to 67 in 2003. \u00be Although Iowa has a higher occ upational fatality rate than the nati onal average, the overall occupational injury and illness rate s documented a 20. 4% reduction, 5.4% greater than the goal for 2010 . \u00be Dramatic step s have been taken in subst ance abu se prevention. I n 2003 , the leg al limit for alcohol levels while operating a m otor vehicle was changed from 0.10 to 0. 08 to red uce the num ber of traffic injuries and f atalities. Between 1999 and 2002, t he proportion of st udents who had used alcohol decreased from 47% to 42% ; and the proportio n who had tried m arijuana declined from 17% to 15% . \u00be Iowa Youth Tobacco Survey data also showed that hi gh school students who ha d used tobacco declined from 39% in 2000 to 34% in 2002. Fr om 2000 to 2002, a 13% decrease in sm oking am ong high scho ol students and a 31% decrease am ong m iddle school stud ents occurred. Since its creation in 2000, 7,000 Iowa teens beca me members of the anti-tobacco m ovement, \"Just Elim Lies.\" \u00be Few public health measures can co mpare with the benefits of vaccines. The National Imm unization Surve y show ed that Iowa has one of the highest child hood imm unization rates. In 200 3, the national rate was 77.9 %. Iowa was at 83.2% . Also in 20 03, Iowa had the third best flu an d pneum onia immunization rates for people aged 65 a nd over, according to a CDC report. \u00be Seat belt use also i mproved. In 2002, 84% of Iowa ns wore a seat b elt, co mpared to 78% in 1999. The ty pes of child restraints that offer the best protection for variou s ages of children have been refined to improve their safety . Introduc tion - Page 2 of 5 April 2005 Introduction HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision \u00be Early childhood education is a fundamental elem ent for developi ng health y child ren. During 1996- 1997 , 40.9% of school dist ricts offered pre-school programs, while 51.9% offered them during 20 02- 2003 . Major Challenges to Iowans' Health Status In 2004, Mor gan-Quito Pr ess, a publisher of hea lth rankings, placed Iowa am ong the nation' s five healthiest states for the fo urth year in a r ow. Also in 2004 , the Uni ted Health Foundation rank ed Iowa 11th best. In the 15 years the report has been produced, Iowa consistently has been ranked in or near the top 1 0 healthi est states. In 2003 , Ford ham Univers ity ranked Iowa num ber one in the nation for social health, the second year the state received top ran king. The social health ranking system combines 16 social indicators that include such im portant health determ inants as infa nt mortalit y; child abuse; children in po verty; teenage suicide, drug ab use, and hig h scho ol com pletion; and inco me inequalit y. Although the state continues to rank as o ne of the healthiest, Iowa will need to do bette r in several areas if it wants to maintain its high ranki ngs. Following are so me of the state' s challenges: \u00be Despite effort s by groups such as the Americ an Di abetes A ssociati on, provider training, and public forum s, Iowa diabetes rates continued t o rise each y ear, from 5.2% in 19 98 to 6.8% in 2003 . One risk factor, obesity, has risen to epidem ic proportions. It will take a massive effort t o increase healthy lifesty les and decrease mortality due to diabetes. \u00be Between 400 and 600 Iowa commun ities discharge approxim ately 4.5 billi on gall ons of untreated human waste into stream s and rivers. Some progress, however, has been made. Over 100 communities have now inst alled treatment s ystem s and taken advan tage of the St ate Revolving Fund. \u00be Food safety continues to be a major challenge. In 2003, appr oximately 750 Iow ans were affected b y 11 m ajor food-borne ill ness episodes. Im proving th e qualit y of retail food establishment inspections can enhance the state' s ability to re duce the risks of food-borne illness. \u00be Since 1996 ydia with 6,462 cases r eported in 2003 (219.0 cases per 100,000 persons). High-ri sk groups i nclude people a ged 15 t o 24, minorit y populations, and those in the juvenile justice sy stem. \u00be Stroke is the l eading cause of disabilit y and the third le ading killer a mong diseases. The death rate from stroke has risen fro m 74.7 per 100 ,000 i n 1991 to 75.6 in 2002. \u00be Infant m ortality is one of the leading health indicat ors used to assess the overall health of a society . Iowa experienced an overall downward trend in infa nt mortality rates over the last decade; however, there continues to be a wide and unacce ptable di sparity in rates for white and African-A meric an infants. Preliminary data f or 2003 show s an Iowa rate of 5.7 per 1,000 li ve births, an increase from the 200 2 rate of 5.3. \u00be Approxim ately 11.8% of the state' s adult popula tion had no health i nsurance in 2003, an increase from 8.8% in 2002 . \u00be Legislation requiring insure rs to provi de coverage for mental illness and addiction, as the y do for any other chronic illness, has not been enacted. \u00be In 199 8, 11% of all m urder victims were aged 5 or younger. That proporti on increased to 12 % in 2002 . \u00be The prevalence of adult overweight/obesity increased from 46.2% in 1991 to 61.7% in 2003. The state's 23.9% obesit y rate is higher than the 15% goal set for the nation in Healt hy People 201 0. April 2005 Introduc tion - Page 3 of 5 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Introduction \u00be Increas ed physical a ctivity can cut the rate of ma ny chronic diseases . Alm ost 23 % of adult Iowans do not engage in any leisure time phy sical activit y. \u00be Since 1998, the adult sm oking rate has rem ained con stant at 23.2 %. The rate dropped sli ghtly in 2003 to 21.7%. What's New in the H ealthy Io wans 2010 M id-Course Revision Since Healthy Iowans 201 0 was published in 2000, there are ne w challenges to the health of Iowans. Examples inc lude bio-em ergencies and terroris m, obesity , a growing senior population, the inc reasing number of Iowans without health insurance, and the needs of new Iowans. Two new chapters have been written - \"Vision\" and \"Emergency Preparedness & Response.\" I n addition, some chapter s were completely revised. The Process for Updating Healthy Iowans 2010 In March 200 4, 25 chapter teams met to start reviewin g and u pdatin g Healthy Io wans 201 0. In making revisions, team members were challenged to r ecognize emerging health p roblems and, at the same time, continue advances fo r keeping Iow ans healthy . The tea ms were joined by resource perso ns who are experts on such special populations as l ow incom e, race/ethnicity , gender, age, and disabilit y. Resource persons were responsible for assuring that an ove rall goal - elim inating health disparities - was addressed. The tea ms also were a sked to pa y special a ttention to the Ol mstead D ecision, which is a U.S. Supreme Court decision that requires 1) governm ent services to be delivered in a way that avoids discri mination against people with disabilities; and 2) states to administer their program s, services and activities in the m ost integ rated settings appropriate to the needs of qualified people with disabilities. Each chapter team select ed a representat ive fo r a committee to review the draft chapters, offer feedback, and approve the draft. Beginn ing in Ju ly 2004, the revie w team and the resource persons listened and responded to c hapter pr esentations. This process ensur ed that major health proble ms were considered, crosscutting issues wer e included, and hea lth disparities were addressed. The review process was co mpleted in Decem ber 2004 . Each team was responsible for writing an updated or new chapter. Although many team mem bers authored the mid-course c hapter revisions, each chapter has the following common elements: \u00be An introduction describing the problem in Iowa, supported by data. \u00be A report on a chievem ents since the plan was published in 2 000. \u00be Revised or new goal statements with baseline da ta and a rationale. (G oal statements without baselines w ere considered developm ental goals.) \u00be Action steps to achieve the goals within t he next five years and the organization(s) responsible for taking the action. (Action steps with no time line will be tracked each y ear and a re considered ongoi ng.) Each chapter has inter-related goals and action steps found in ot her chapters. The im pact of any one chapter is more co mplete and powe rful when these inter-relationships are considered. Dr. Ronald Eckoff, review tea m member and former medica l director in the Iowa Depa rtment of Public Health, prepared an updated list at the end of each chapter. Introduc tion - Page 4 of 5 April 2005 Introduction HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Healthy People 2010: The M odel for Healthy Iowans 2010 In general, Healthy Iowans 2010 chapters modeled Healthy People 2010 . Som e focus areas in the national plan are addressed in different chapters: osteoporosis, arthritis, me dical product safety, and health communications. P roblem gam bling, n ot found in Healthy People 201 0, is covered in Iowa's Substance Abuse and Probl em Gam bling chapter. In the Occupational Safety and Health chapter, more attention is gi ven to farm safety than i n Healthy People 2010 . The Iowa plan also has separat e chapters for violent an d abusive beh avior and u nintentiona l injuries. Another difference is that the new Healthy Iowans 20 10 chapter on vi sion was not expanded to i nclude hearing. Contact Information Chapter tea m leaders, facil itators and me mbers are listed at the end of each chapter. Chapter tea m facilitators can respond t o questions ab out citations or chapter content. April 2005 Introduc tion - Page 5 of 5 Access to Quality Health Servic es HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Chapter 1 Access to Quality Health Services Introduct ion This chapter is an evol ution and expansi on of goals in the Healthy Iowans 2000 chapter on Clinical Preventive Services. It covers the top- ics included in the federal Healthy People 2010 chapter on Access to Quality Health Services with the exception of Em ergency Medic al Ser- vices (EMS). That topic is included in the Healthy Iowans 201 0 chapt er on Unintentional Injuries. During the 2 005 mid-course review, the chapter was updated to reflect progress and revisions based on current resources, goals and strategies of s takeholders and statewide asse ssed needs. Acce ss to primary and pre ventive care a nd other com ponents of health care is im portant to achieve the overall Healthy People 201 0 goals of elim inatin g health dispa rities and increasing years of healthy life. Ensuring access to quality health care is one of the federal plan' s four \"enabling\" goals that bolster progress toward overall goals. Man y of the persistent disparities in health outcomes refl ect problem s of a ccess within a conti nuum of care that includes: Preventive se rvices; Primary care; Emergency services; Long-term care; Home and community -based care; and Rehabilitative care. These elemen ts are critical co mponents of the interface between public health and clinical medicine and are linked to goals in this c hapter and other cha pters in Healthy Iowans 20 10. The mid-course re view also considered the Ol mstead decision, the health-care w orkforce, and estab- lishment of a medical ho me concept and other methods of coordinatio n of care, transp ortation, and a sy stem to address language as a barrier to access. Access is the foundatio n upon which the outcom es of private and p opulatio n health care are predicate d. Therefore, it is im porta nt that this chapter be reviewed in conjunction with other Healthy Iowans 20 10 chapters for its cross cutting-im pact in all areas of health care. Access has b een defined by the Institute of Medicine (IO M) as \"...the timely use of per- sonal health services to ach ieve the best possible health outco mes.\" This definition requ ires con- sidering as indicators both the utilization of ser- vices and the outcom es. The IOM definition of quality is \"the degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the like- lihood of desi red health out comes and are con- sistent with current professional knowledge.\" Healthy Iowans 201 0 goals and action st eps focus on areas where significant disparities in access to quality health services exist between the general populatio n and vulnerable p opula- tions when such disparities are likely to result in differences of care that affe ct years of he althy life. The issues ar e crosscutting - m easuring and seeking to improve qualit y of life and de aling with aspects of health services that i mprove and maintain ph ysical, mental, em otional, and social functionin g. They include such apparent barri- ers to services as distribution of provi ders and services, knowledge and cost of services, and knowledge of how to access services. The initial focus in this c hapter is on the interface between populati on-ba sed interventions and clinic al care. Over the past two decades, major change s have occurred in the structure of the American health-care d elivery system and the roles of the federal, state and local govern ments in e nsuring access to quality care for all at-risk populations. April 2005 Chap ter 1 - Page 1 of 24 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Access to Quality He alth Servic es Such changes include a shift toward home and community -based car e, increased patient acuity , or degree of illness in the inpatient setting and changes in th e provider rei mbursement sy stem . Acce ss to primary care an d appropriate preven- tive care for a ll Americans remains a cha llenge. Furtherm ore, health care must meet a cceptable standards of qualit y and be delivered in a setting that fosters c ulturally competent care. Having adequate ac cess to health care ca n significantly influence patient use of the sy stem , and, ultim ately, measures of acce ss are i mportant for evaluating th e qualit y of the nation 's and Iowa's health care. Li mitations on acces s to ca re extend beyond such simple causes as shortage of pro- viders or facilities in some areas. Even when health care is r eadily available, people m ay not have a con sistent source of care or may experience barriers to services. These could include cost barriers (e.g., no health-care insurance or inadequate insurance); struc tural barriers (e.g., proxim ity of facilities or provid- ers); transportation barriers; and language barri- ers. Also, populations wit h special needs, such as the elderly , chronically ill, HIV-infect ed peo- ple, and people with disabilities, require access to providers with special knowledge and skills. One significa nt measure of the acces s prob- lem is the proportion of pe ople without health insurance. Since the early 1990s, t hat proportio n has increased. Nationall y, those under 6 5 with- out coverage increased fro m 15.7% in 1989 t o 17.6% in 2003. Com paratively, 13 .1% of Iowa's pop ulation un der th e age of 65 h ad no health insurance in 2003. Additionally , significant disparities in cov- erage exist am ong racial and ethnic gr oups. Na- tionall y, approxim ately 32.9% of Hispanics lacked coverage in 20 03 w hile 21.5% of African Americans w ere in that situation. On the other hand, the proportion of pe ople with ong oing primary care (excluding t he emer- gency room ) rose during the decade, from ap- proxim ately 78% to 84% nationall y. Having a usual source of care is as sociated with im proved access to pre ventive and follow-up care. If the first ste p is assuring access, the logical second step is assuring qual ity. The pr oblem of how to define , monitor and assure quality have received exte nsive attention in recent years. Va- rieties of measures are bein g developed a t the national, state, local and private sector le vels. The National Co mmittee on Qualit y Assurance (NCQA), a managed care accreditation group, is doing som e of the m ost sig nificant work. This has led to the developm ent of HEDIS (the Health Plan Em ployer Data and Inform ation Set), which is widely used for evaluating health- plan performance as a measure of quality. The Centers f or Medicaid and Medicare Services (CM S) has participated in the devel- opment of H EDIS measures, particularl y those designed for Medicare and Medicaid. HEDIS 3.0 includes Medicare and Medicaid measures. The Joint Commission for the Accreditation of Healthcar e Organizations (JCAH O) has devel- oped performance measures as well. In addition, the Agency for Health Car e Policy and Rese arch has developed the Consum er Assessmen t of Health Plans Surve y (CAHPS), which will be used by organizations to asses s consu mer ex- periences wit h health plans . The Institute of Medicine released the re- port, \"To Err is Hu man\" in 2000 and \"Crossing the Quality Chasm\" in 2001 These reports fur- thered the efforts of polic y makers and health- care institutions to im prove the qualit y of health services on a more global scale. The findings and reco mme ndations of these two repor ts are reflected in this chapter and throughout Healthy Iowans 20 10. The growth o f managed care has created a national em phasis on preventive service s, health-education m aterials, and the role of the patient in ado pting health y behaviors. Io wa is experiencing dram atic ch anges in po pulation demographics, including increasing num bers of high-risk pop ulations. At the sa me time, there ar e dim inished re - sources for publicl y funde d health care and an increase in demand. These factors, coupled with the em ergence of manage d care, have made im - plem entation of a sy stem built on prevention and inform ed con sumers an imperative. Within the evolving health-care sy stem , it is recognized that the health status of the whole state and nation will i mprove onl y as dispar ities in services are reduced and elim inated. Chap ter 1 - Page 2 of 24 April 2005 Access to Quality Health Servic es HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Acce ss to high quality preventive care is an integral part of quality health care and critical to eliminating disparities in outcomes. Cli nical preventive services, which include imm uniza- tions, screenings and cou nseling, have a substan- tial impact on m orbidity (disease and/or illness) and m ortality (death) from many of the leading causes of dea th. Assuring acc ess to pri mary and secondary prevention has proven effective in reducing populati on morbidit y and mortality . The rec- ommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force ar e a guide for services that should be a co mponent of q uality care. Im proving ac- cess to appropriate preventive care requires re- moval of barriers at many levels, including th ose for the patient, the provide r, and the s ystem. Important patient barriers include lack o f knowledge or conviction a bout t he importance of prevention, lack of a primary care provider, and lack of financial r esources. While patient awar eness an d acceptance of some procedures such as mammography are high, other preven- tive services such as for colorectal cancer or sex ually transm itted disease s are less accepted. Some patient populations are skepti- cal of even widely accepte d preventive meas- ures. Patient autonom y must be respected while being provide d acces s to ac curate infor mation in order to m ake inform ed decisions. Strong predictors of appro priate preventive care ar e having health ins urance, a good incom e, and a prim ary care provider. While reimburse- ment for co mmon sc reenin gs such as mammog- raphy and the Pap s mear is standard in most in- surance plans , reimburse ment for other effective preventive services, such a s tobacco ces sation counseling, is less co mmon. Important pro vider barriers include lack of time, lack of training in prevention, doubt about effectivenes s, and m edical practices that do not facilitate prev ention. Although provi der accep- tance of screening is gener ally high, ther e is greater skepticism about the effectiveness of counseling pa tients on health y lifest yles. A va- riety of measures, such as computerized or m an- ual tracking, patient and pr ovider rem inders, clinical guidelines, patient input, an d health edu-cation can help providers deliver preventive ser- vices. System barrie rs may include lack of re- sources or attention to prevention, lack of cover- age or inadeq uate reim bursem ent, and lack of systems to track performance in prevention. Measure s that can increas e delivery of clinical preventive services include offering the m among standard covered benef its, feedback on perfor m- ance to providers and practices, incentives for improved performance, an d a sy stem to identify and provide outreach to patients overdue for ser- vices. Another frequentl y identif ied sy stem barrier is the lack of transportation. Many low-i ncome families do not have reliable transportation. Public transportation has li mited routes and tim e schedules wh ich may not coincide with the needs of clients. Som e transportation s ystems may not be accessible to people with dis abilities. Though there are many transportation se rvices throug hout Iowa, the level of coordinati on var- ies. Transportation problems ar e also c overed in the Healthy Iowans 20 10 chapter on dis abilities. Healthy Iowans 201 0 addresse s health-c are access along the continuum of care. Goals and action steps for long-term care, ho me and com - munity -based care, and rehabilitative ser vices cover persons with func tional lim itation s regard- less of age. Long-term care is health, personal care, and soci al service s delivered over a sus- tained period to persons who have lost or never acquired so me degree of functional capacity . People who n eed long-term care have phy sical or mental conditions that li mit their capacity for self-ca re. They include people of all ages, fro m those who acquired ph ysical or mental lim itations at birth or i n their youth to t hose with dim inished functionin g as a result of aging or som e life- altering incident. About 40% of these people are under age 65 and include p eople who ne ed the help or super vision of other people to perform daily activities. The activities include personal care, such as bathing, dressing, eating, toileting, going from bed to chair, and getting around (with special equipm ent, if needed) inside the home. Instrumental activities of daily li ving enable a person to l ive ind ependentl y and in- clude preparing m eals, shopping , using the tele- April 2005 Chap ter 1 - Page 3 of 24 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Access to Quality He alth Servic es phone, taki ng medications, managing m oney, and perform ing h ousework. Long-term care covers a co ntinuum of health and social services i n instituti ons, the community and at hom e. The continu um in- cludes services in instituti ons such as nursing homes, rehabilitation hospitals, and places pro- viding sub-acute care, hospice and assist ed- living services. Other levels include home- based service s such as home health an d personal care, hospice, hom emaker help, hom e-delivered meal s, and community -based services su ch as adult da y care, social servi ces, congregate meals, transportation and escort se rvices, legal protec- tive services, and counseling for clients and caregivers. The goals of all of these se rvices are to i m- prove functioning t hrough rehabilitation, main- tain existing f unctioni ng, or slow deterioration in functioning w hile delivering care in the least restrictive w ay. To do so, people with special needs should be identified early . Rehabi litative services are meant to rest ore specific skills, in- cluding overall physical mobilit y and functional abilities. Their goal is to re turn people to the highest level of functio ning by various kinds of therapy . Progress During the Healthy Iowans 2010 mid-course review, Chapter 1 - Acces s to Quality Health Services was revised to address the quality of health care. Specifically , some goals fr om the original versi on were replaced with new ones to improve acce ss to quality health service by tar- geting pr oviders and sy stems. The goals reflect what is alread y in development and what is planned b y stakeholders, and have a stro nger likelihood for achievement of success by 2010. The intent is to better asses s acc ess and im prove it throu gh provider training and s ystem s coordi- nation (e.g., establishing q uality perfor mance measures, transportation, interpretation, technol- ogy). The goal to i ncrease fundin g by 50% for Iowa' s education of health professions and allied health disciplines was a chieved. The State Loan Repay ment Program increased federal fu nding from $75,000 to $1 50,000. All of the St ate Loan Repay ment funds are allocated each y ear. The J1-Visa waiver program known as Conr ad 20 increased to 30 phy sician place ments an d places 100% of the f oreign p hysicians in unders erved areas. Furtherm ore, the state is participating in a national recruitment and retention web site known as the 3R Net, (Rural Recruitment and Retention Network). It provides national acce ss for em ployers and potential applicants to adver- tise or find e mployment for health care in Iowa. It is ad ministered by the Io wa Department of Public Health. During the current state and fed- eral fiscal constraint, it is i mportant to maintain fundin g and i ts use throug h 2010 for I owa's education of health professions and allied health disciplines. To m ove toward elim ination of health dis- parities and increasing y ears of health, Iowans need acce ss to quality health services. The goals in this chapter support t hose in other Healthy Iowans 20 10 chapters. They are intended to set the stage for those chap ters to increase greater access. Goal Statements & Action Steps 11 Goal S tatement Reduce to zero the proportion of chil- dren and adults under aged 65 without health care coverage. Baselin e, 200 3: 8.6% of Iowan s under ag e 18 a nd 13.1% of Iowa ns unde r age 6 5 do not have health in surance. Rationale According to the Kaiser Family Foundat ion, the last 25 years of health-services r esearch sup- ports the notion that having acces s to health in- surance or using m ore medical car e improves life chances. Immigrants, r efugees, and self- employed people, as well as their fa milies, are among those who have the most trouble obtain- ing coverage. Having health insurance reduces mortality rates by 10-15%. Having a better state of health or goo d healt h improves annual earning s by 10% to 30% (depe nding on m easures and specific Chap ter 1 - Page 4 of 24 April 2005 Access to Quality Health Servic es HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision health condition) and increases educational at- tainment. People without coverage are less likely to obtain preventive services, r esulting in increased morbidity and mortality . According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 17.6% of Americans under age 65 had no health insurance in 2003 . Am ong children u nder 18, 11.4% were without cover age. In Iowa, 13.1% of the un der-65 p opulatio n was without cover- age in 200 3. For those un der age 18, the figure was 8.6% . Since 2001, there has been erosion in the am ount of private, em ployer sponsore d in- surance in Iowa. Figure 1 and Tables 1-3 show data for unins ured grou ps and preventi ve care and for special populatio ns in Iowa. Table 3 reflects the d ecline in refugees over the past five years, shifting em phasi s to other imm igrants that are uninsured or un derinsu red.

Baseli ne: See Ra - tionale. Rationale Acce ss and quality are inextricably linked. In the first dr aft of Healthy Iowans 20 10, Chap- ter 1, Acces s to Quality Health Services, authors and contribut ors sought t o address access to qualit y health services through use of the Health Plan Em ployer Data and Inform ation Set (HEDIS). The strategy was to prom ote awar e- ness of HEDI S outcom es to enable health con- sumers to bet ter choose which services were of the highest quality . In the 20 05 m id-course review, team mem- bers believed that consum er choice of a health- care provider was based more on their h ealth insurance options and cove rage. Therefore, the focus has broadened to address w ays to enable and assure that all health care is of the highest qualit y. The problem s of how to define, monitor and assure quality have received extensive atten- tion in recent y ears. Varieties of measures are being develo ped at the nat ional, state, local, and private sector levels. Many organizations are assisting medical clinics, hospitals, home-health agencies, and nursing homes to im prove patient safety and quality of care. The National Co mmittee on Qualit y Assur- ance (NC QA) is a managed -care a ccreditation group wor king with m edical clinics. Its work led to develo pment of HEDIS, which is widely used for evaluating health-plan performance of medical clini cs. The Centers f or Medicare a nd Medicaid (CMS), formerly known a s Health Care Financ- ing Adm inistration, has participated in t he de- velopm ent of HEDIS measures, particularly those designed for Medicare and Medicaid. HEDIS 3.0 in cludes Medicare and Medicaid measures. In response to two reports by the Instit ute of Medicine, \"To Err is Human\" (2000) an d \"Crossing the Quality Chasm\" (2001), about a dozen nationa l organization s are urging h ospitals to lead the charge to im prove patient safety and quality of care. Six steps are reco mmen ded: 1. Safe: avoidi ng inj uries to patients from the care that is intended to hel p them . 2. Effective : providing services bas ed on sci- entific knowl edge to all who coul d ben efit and refraining from providing s ervices to those not likely to benefit (avoidin g underuse and over- use). 3. Patient-centered : providi ng care that is respectful of and responsiv e to patient pr efer- ences, needs and values, and ensuring that pa- tient values guide all clinical decisions. 4. Timely : redu cing waits and som etimes harmful delays for those who receive and those who give care. 5. Efficient : avoiding waste, including waste of equipm ent, supplies, ide as, and energy. 6. Equitable : providin g care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteri stics such as gender, ethnicit y, geographic location, and socioeconom ic status. Some of Iowa' s rural and urban hospi tals are following t he 30 recommendations of L eapfrog, a private sect or group addressing performance measures, wh ile others are developing network- wide co mparative benchmarks of qualit y. Cur- rently, there i s an initiative to gather and bench- mark state wide quality data fro m the Cr itical Acce ss Hospi tals and report statewide be st prac- tices to the Iowa Hospital Association (IHA). The ultim ate goal is to part icipate in m ulti-state benchmarking. April 2005 Chap ter 1 - Page 7 of 24 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Access to Quality He alth Servic es Tied to qualit y is patient satisfaction. The Centers for Medicine and Medicaid will soon require all hospitals to participate in ass essing patient experiences through the Hospital Con- sumer Assessment of Healt h Plans Surve y (HCAHPS). This, too, wil l have bench marking capabilities. State government can assist in driv- ing q uality improvement of health care throu gh performance mea sures by: Drawing atte ntion to best practices and en- couraging providers to adopt them ; Facilitating com parisons of accountable en- tities, such as hospitals, he alth plans, long term care facilities, and, potenti ally, physicians' prac- tices; Enabling t he h payment or other means; Expanding research ers' capacity to identify factors that drive or dim inish health-care quality ; Helping to li nk accountable entities to pa- tient outcom es; Providing the clinical data needed to for mu- late workable risk-adjustment technique s; and Providin g data to identif y providers who consistently provide substa ndard care, and de- veloping strategies for im provement or narrow- ing of t heir scope of practice. 12.1 Action Step By 2010, spo nsor contin uing education and networking f or hospitals, c linics, communit y health centers, and provider s to identif y current resea rch and practices, sha re best practi ces, and collaborate in data collection and rep orting.

(An Iowa Dep artment of Public Health, Iowa Hospital Associat ion, and Iowa Foundat ion for Medic al Care action step.) 12.4 Action Step By 2010, ide ntify and com municate strate- gies to increase repres entat of nic m Iowa's he alth-care workforce throug h partn erships with public and private en- tities. (An Iowa Depart ment of Public Health, Iowa Hospital Association, and Iowa Fo undation for Medical Care a ction step.) 13 Goal S tatement Increase b y 25% acces s to primary care for the underserved population. Baseline, 2004: The community heal th cente r network in Iowa provide d acce ss to 1 2% of the state's un - derse rved po pulation. Rationale Loss of population in rural areas and in- creasing proportions of elderly and immigrants present challenges to Iowa's public and private health care providers to extend statewide acce ss to prim ary care. Althoug h the total num ber of primary care phy sicians pr acticing in Iowa has increased in recent y ears, the proport ion willing to practice in rural areas ha s decrea sed. This is due to the retire ment of elderly physicians and the tendenc y for younger o nes to practice in ur- ban areas. In a recent study (Iowa Health Fact Book, 2 001), 54% of prim ary care ph ysicians practiced in the eight m etropolitan counties, leaving less than half of the m to provide acce ss in the remaining 91 countie s. In response to the uneven distributio n of primary care providers and clinics, a seri es of federal and state progra ms offer incentives to increase he alth care ac cess in Iowa. The Na- tional Health Service Corps, PRIMECARRE, Student Comm unity Prim ary Care Initia tive (SCPCI), and Nurse Education Loan Re payment Chap ter 1 - Page 8 of 24 April 2005 Access to Quality Health Servic es HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Program provide education al loan repayment incentives to recruit and retain provi ders in un- derserved are as. The J-1 Visa waiver gi ves in- ternational ph ysicians the o pportu nity to practice in un derserved regions. Federally funded safety net program s offer low cost health care, preventive care and Medi- care s ervices at co mmunity health centers, Fed- erally Qualifi ed Health Centers (FQHC), tribal health clinics, m igrant healt h centers, and health centers for the hom eless. Federally Qualified Health Center s offer fees b ased on ability to pa y, extending affordable care to the uninsured and underinsured. In 20 04, the Community Health Center netwo rk in Iowa ha d seven centers pro- viding access to 12% of t he state' s underserved populati on. Expansions a nd new starts of FQHCs can e xtend the safety net to a larger pro- portion of underserved individuals and f amilies. 13.1 Action Step By 2010, increase access p oints (expansions or new starts) of federally funded health centers to provide access to 25% of the underserved populati on. ( An Iowa Dep artment of Public Health, Burea u of Health Care Ac cess and Iowa Nebraska Pri mary Care As sociation action step.) 13.2 Action Step By 2010, increase by ten the num ber of f a- cilities that use federal program s (e.g., St ate Loan Repayment Program or National Health Service Corps) offering a sliding fee scale to patients. (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health, Burea u of Health Care Ac cess, action step.) 13.3 Action Step Throug h 2010, contin ue to adm inister fed- eral and state recruit ment a nd retention pro- grams (e.g., National Heal th Service Corps, PRIMECARRE, J-1 Visa, Student Com munity Primary Care Initiative, and Nurse Education Loan Repayment Programs) to staff health care access points. (An Iowa Depart ment of Public Health, Burea u of Health Care Ac cess action step.) 14 Goal S tatement Ensure a competent and diverse health workforce by assessi ng and forecasting workforce suppl y and demand and b y promoting local strategies to recruit and retain w orkers through the inclusion of all 99 counties in a nurse tracking pro- ject. Baseli ne: See Rationale. Rationale Data collection and strategic planning is re- quired to m eet the health needs of Iowa' s largely rural popu lation as the pro portion of eld erly people and i mmigrant children with li mited re- sources ste adily increases. National supp ly and dem and models project a shortfall of 9,100 registered nurses (RNs) in Iowa by 20 20, alm ost one-fourth of the current actively licensed RN workfo rce. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a growing need for di- rect car e wor kers. Iowa data is require d to iden- tify trends in demographics, econom ics, educa- tion, cross-state migration, health-care us e pat- terns, and strategies to recruit and retain health workers that im pact Iowa' s projected demand. Direct contact with em ployers provides in- formation about sup ply and dem and in their communities, making it easier to predict and avert shortages, fill vacancies, and reduce turn- over. Direct contact with health workers pro- vides new information that allows them to ac- cess jobs, education and ne w resources t o im- prove the wor k enviro nment. Strategies devel- oped and im plem ented locally, and adapt ed for statewide application, are highly effective when administrator s beco me state experts who dem on- strate and communicate b est practic es for re- cruitm ent and retention of health workers. Tracking of Iowa' s registered nurses wa s initiated in July 2003, and t he developm ent of this m odel will be used to e xpand t o othe r health professions. A project to track patient choice and population trends by hospital service area and diagnostic category was initiated in April 2004 14.1 Action Step By 2010, incl ude all RNs in the University of Iowa Offic e of Statewide Clinical Education April 2005 Chap ter 1 - Page 9 of 24 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Access to Quality He alth Servic es (OSCEP) He alth Professions Tracking Inven- tory.

Basel ine: Will be identif ied throug h assess ment b y the Iow a Department of Pub- lic Health, Bureau of Health Care Access. Rationale Under-representation of ra cial and ethnic minorities in the health professions is increasing in Iowa. The disparity is particularly evident among Mexican-Am erican s who com prise the largest seg ment of the Lati no populatio n. Iowa's Latino population i ncreased by 152.7% from 1990 to 2000 . Durin g that period , the La- tino populati on increased by as m uch as 1,100% in six of I owa's 99 counties . The greatest in- crease occurred in rural, non-m etropolitan coun- ties. At this tim e, 39.7 % of the Latino p opula- tion is u nder age 18. Lang uage and prio r educa- tion are barriers to entry into the health fields for many Hispani c adults. Between July 1, 2002 and June 30, 2003 , 41% of Iowa's m inority populati ons were served in the adult li teracy program . Hispanics represented 22% of enroll- ment in the adult basic edu cation progra m. In 200 4, more than 80% of respondents t o a statewide sur vey of nursing faculty reported an increase in en rollments in the current ac ademic year and 90% projected an increase in the 2004- 2005 year. Com pounding the demand for edu- cation, respondents projected 128 facult y vacan- cies in nursing alone in fall 2004. Nurse faculty vacancies i mpact the number of students able to enroll in nursing schools. Many institut ions are reporting waiting lists for nursing enro llment. While indivi dual program s provide i nnovative teaching met hods, a need exists for stat ewide coordination and inclusion of additional health occupations. 15.1 Action Step By 2010, establish an Area Health Educa - tion Center (AHEC)-sty le center in collaboration with schools and uni versities in Iowa. (An Iowa Department of Public Health, Bureau of Health Care A ccess action step.) 15.2 Action Step By 2010, dev elop collabor ative projects that assist childre n from racial and ethnic m inority , immigrant an d refugee pop ulations to en ter, and succeed in, health occupations. Establish a web- based point of contact to acces s stat e data, trend analy ses, local experts, and fundi ng opportuni- ties.

Baseli ne: See Ration ale. Chap ter 1 - Page 10 of 2 4 April 2005 Access to Quality Health Servic es HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Rationale With the exception of go od mental health program s for Bosnians in Des Moines a nd Wa- terloo, Iowa' s health and mental health sy stem s are ill-equipped to m eet the linguistic needs of Limited Engli sh Proficient (LEP) people. In the absence of bilingual pr ofessionals, inter preters and translators to comm unicate and serve their clients. The Iowa court sy stem tested 77 people across the state and will have tested about 25 more in the fall of 2004 on ethics in interpreta- tion in the courts. This progress, however, does not solve the problem that Iowa has no statewide mechanis m (i.e., credentialing or certification) to assure the ed ucation, ethical practice, q uality, and com petence of interpreters and translators. In a clarificat ion of Ti tle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the federal Office for Civil Rights stipula ted in 2000 that any entity receiv- ing federal fu nds, includ ing health care organi- zations receiv ing Medicaid and SCHIP (State Chile Health Insurance Program ), must provide no-cost language assi stanc e to patients with lim - ited English proficiency . Unem ployment in Iowa ran ged from 2.6% in 20 00 to an estimated 4.5% in August 2004 , compared to the national average of 5.8% in 2004. Iowa depends on recruiting refugees, i m- migrants, and m igrant and seasonal far m work- ers to meet th e demand for workers. A healthier workforce may be m aintain ed if health educa- tion is pro vided in appro priate languages about how to sta y well, developing health y habits, and obtaining basic preventive services. Ma ny health materi als are avail able, but the y are often poorl y translated, hard to re ad, or are not cultur- ally appropria te. Several studies have found that bilingual patients are evaluated differently when i nter- viewed in English rather than Spanish. I n one study , Hispanic-A mericans with bipolar disorder were more likely to be m isdiagnosed wit h schizophrenia than were their non-Hispanic white counterparts, and onl y 24% of Hispanics with depression and anxiet y were found to have received appropriate care, compared to 34% for whites. Another stud y found that Latin os who visited a general medical d octor were le ss than half as likely as whites to receive either a diag- nosis of depression or antidepressant medicine (2001 Fact Sheet, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Ad ministration Aging) The Iowa Commission on Latino Affairs, (ICLA) reports that onl y 50% of Latino s have health insurance. Latinos are les s likely to ac- cess preventi ve health, pre-natal and me ntal health service s. They are m ore likely to use emergency rooms, live in h ousing t hat contains lead risks, be over-vaccinated, and be exposed to environm ental hazards in the workplace. In May 2004, the Iowa Co mmission on L atino Af- fairs, (ICLA) proposed legi slation to dev elop a mechanis m to ensure the qualification of Span- ish-language interpreters in the areas of health and social ser vices. 16.1 Action Step By 2005, develop a Language Acc ess T ask- force to ident ify and pr ovide reco mmen dations for adm inistrative rules on im plementation of IC 246: I owa Spanish Language Interpreters Law.

(An Iowa Department of Public Health and Iowa Departm ent of Hu man Rights action step.) 17 Goal S tatement Complete the development of and begin implementing a long-range plan for re- balancing long-term care for Iowa's ag- ing population and those with dis abili- ties. Baseli ne: See Rationale. Rationale Long-term care has been defined as nursing facility care. Toda y's definition is a comm unity network of he alth and supp ortive services that helps chronically impaired persons and t heir caregivers manage their situations with the right provider, at the right tim e and in the lea st restric- tive setting th ey can call ho me. The co mponents of the lon g-term care continuum include nursing facilities, adu lt day care, housing with s uppor- tive services, assist ed living, interm ediat e care facilities for t he mentally retarded and develop- mentally disabled, and home and co mmunity -based service s (Adapted from the A merican As- sociation of Homes and Services for the Aging). Iowa is moving to reform its Medicaid Long Term Care Program . Along with m ost other states, Iowa r ecognizes that hom e and commu- nity-based alternatives can be effective i n divert- ing peo ple need care fro m expensive nur sing facilities. For over 35 years, the Area Agencies on Aging has succes sfully provided hom e and community -based servic es for older people in Iowa. Medicaid, which is funded by federal and state governments, is the largest fundin g source for long- term care in the United States. Until 20 years ago, M edicaid offered older peo ple the option of goi ng int o a nurs ing facilit y with Medicaid funding (state/federal match) or losing out o n Medicaid support al together. \"Waivers\" from this trad itional long-t erm care sy stem were offered in recogniti on that states may have alter- native way s to contain costs and better meet the needs of olde r persons. In 1988, Iowa applied for a nd received waivers to begin develo pment of a comm unity - based sy stem . Comm unity -based sy stems ar e well received and are a good start at allowing people to sta y in their h omes for as long as pos- sible. In Iow a, however, the waivers ar e limited in scope and function as pie ces of a frag mented system . Inadequate rei mbursement has been, and continues to be, a barrier to acces sing Home and Comm unity-Based Services (HC BS). Iowa has at le ast two significant efforts to establish a U niversal Ass essment Tool. The first is the National Governors' Association project with Iowa State Senators Tinsm an and Ragen, State Repres entatives Direc- tors on (Iowa Departm ent of Human Services), H averland (Iowa Depart ment of Elder Affairs), Hansen, (Iowa Departm ent of Public Health), Young (Iowa Departm ent of Inspec- tions and Ap peals) and key stakeholders, includ- ing AARP Iowa and the Iowa Association of Area Agencies on Aging . The second is a legis- lative long-te rm care co mmittee established by State Senator Tins man and Representativ e Heaton to explore this issu e, along with others, during the 2005 legislative session. Chap ter 1 - Page 12 of 2 4 April 2005 Access to Quality Health Servic es HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision From a policy perspective, pay ment of HCBS providers in general will be discussed by the legislature in 200 5. The Iowa Departm ent of Elder Affairs (IDEA) is aware that HCBS pro- viders are justifiabl y walking away from provi d- ing Title XIX HCBS waiver services because there is a negative financial im pact in providin g the HCBS ser vices, and in the initial assessment and ongoing case- manag ement service, which is required but unfun ded. While the assessment is theoretically paid for, actual rem uneration to provi ders and Area Agencies on Aging (AAA) is often far below the actual cost. F or exam ple, it may take two or more home visits by a professional to com plete an asse ssment. The cost of the first asse ssment is usually provided at a los s, and the need for a second visit i s usually com pletely writte n off by the HCBS provider or AAA. Increasingly , HCBS providers are de clining to enroll low-income a dults because they are no longer able to subsidize a state program . The result is that consum ers' access to servic es may be lim ited and, ultim ately , the overall cost of long-term care increased. Rebalancing Iowa's long-term care sy stem will not be possibl e unless the proble m with ass essments is a d- dressed. Also, providers of Title XIX HCBS must rec eive equitable re muneration for the of com pleting asse ssments, ongoing case man- agem ent, and other services rendered. Major rebalancing of I owa long-term care will require the strong support and advocacy of the Governor and the legislature. The fo llowing action steps from state govern ment are n ecessary for Iowa to i mplement a trul y coor dinat ed sys- tem of long-t erm care. 17.1 Action Step By 2010, create a legislative mandate to re- balance the long-term care system using the best practices of I owa and othe r states, so me of which are included in the following strategies. (An Iowa Departm ent of Elder Affairs action step.) 17.2 Action Step By 2010, buil d a m ulti-year (2 or 3 years) long-term care budget that will assu me: The development of the new \"rebal anced\" system to be \"budget neutr al\" to the State of Iowa; and Savings from reduced \"bed day s\" in nurs ing facilities will be redirected to adequatel y fund home and co mmunity -based services, c ase man- agem ent, qualit y control , technolog y enhance- ment, and local ad ministration. (An Iowa Departm ent of Elder Affairs, Sen- ior Livin g Coordinating Unit action step.) 17.3 Action Step By 2010, dev elop new strategies that pro- mote the rebalancing of the long-term care sy s- tem, including: Pre-scr eening for all adm issions; Diversion and relocation f rom institutional settings; and Delay of estate recovery to allow people to return to their own hom es after tem porary ab- sences in the hospital or nursing facility . (An Iowa Departm ent of Elder Affairs, Sen- ior Livin g Coordinating Unit action step.) 17.4 Action Step By 2010, use the Senior Li ving Pr ogram, as it was originally designed, as a model fo r how the sy stem should respond to client needs. The program includes: Flexible spending; Multiple opt ions for intervention; and Least interve ntion appropriate to needs. (An Iowa Departm ent of Elder Affairs, Sen- ior Livin g Coordinating Unit action step.) 17.5 Action Step By 2010, m ake acce ss to the Medicaid sy s- tem more responsive b y: Dramatically decrea sing the period between application for Medicaid, eligibilit y determina- tion, and the start of servic es; Allowing Medicaid services to begin as soon as possible with \"presum ptive eligibilit y\" within limits set by the state; Making m ore services av ailable under exist- ing waivers to allow for more choices a nd better options; an d Co-locating eligibilit y and service planning to create effic iency and good custom er service. April 2005 Chap ter 1 - Page 13 of 2 4 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Access to Quality He alth Servic es The current sy stem fragments decision making between financial eligibility and service assess- ments, causin g dela y and o ften und ue di fficulty for the client. (An Iowa Departm ent of Elder Affairs, Sen- ior Livin g Coordinating Unit action step.) 17.6 Action Step By 2010, build a statewide system that is available and accessible to all and that will be a safety net for all Iowans by: Allowing and encouraging business models that have been shown to work for som e popula- tions, including Phy sician-based Ass essment and Counseling for Exercise (PACE), C ash and Counseling, a nd ot her managed-care models; Defining the range of services that must be available to clients statewi de; and Adapting to local needs, but ensuring c on- sistent outcomes st atewid e. (An Iowa Departm ent of Elder Affairs, Sen- ior Livin g Coordinating Unit action step.) 17.7 Action Step By 2010, authorize Iowa' s Area Agenci es on Aging to im plement a s ystem at the l ocal or regional level to enhance: Accessibility ; The m ost appropriate use of local, state, fed- eral, or private resources fo r the m ost appropri- ate intervention for t he client; The invol vement of \"natural\" caregivers and volunteers as appropriate; and Mix and m atch of funding sources (with in the lim its of t he law) in the best interests of the client. (An Iowa Departm ent of Elder Affairs, Sen- ior Livin g Coordinating Unit action step.) 18 Goal S tatement Reduce the proportion of people unable to access long-term care in Iow a. Base- line: To be identified. Rationale Long-term care enco mpasses health care at many levels and in a variety of envir onments. Providers incl ude nursing homes, ho me health care agenci es, adult da y care, and assiste d living. Populatio ns served include people over age 65, people of all ages who are chronically mentally and/or phy sically ill, and people with di sabili- ties. These persons are unable to obtain services because of funding problems, lack of available staff, lack of inform ation about services, trans- portation problems, lack of understandi ng abou t the potential benefits of the services, and unwill- ingness to accept assist ance from others. Another barrier to acces s is that people typi- cally do not seek information on long-ter m care before a crisi s. The phy sician, the discharge planner, the various allied providers, and the pastor or rabb i are often poi nts of contact and direction. Th e importance of fam ily members must be reco gnized. It is frequently the children of aging parents who are sandwiched between two generations and com peting needs - t hat is, their own children's needs and their parent's needs - while balancing work dem ands. These families are t he most urgentl y in need of infor- mation and services. Toda y's seekers of this information are baby boom ers who may be techn ologicall y sophisti- cated in acce ssing inform ation. Inform ation and referral services such as the Elder Care L ocator (1-800- 677-1 116 or www .iowafa milycaregiver.org ) will be vital in helping obtain access. Their linkage is connected to the aging net work of pro viders. 18.1 Action Step By 2007, ide ntify the n umber of people needing lo ng-term care in Iowa and develop a targeted awar eness c ampaign to educate the m on resources.

(An Iowa Department of Public Health and Univer sity of Iowa, Iowa Center for Public Health Prepared- ness action st ep.) 19.3 Action Step By 2008, offe r internet-based education and training for the health workforce based on the work of the s ub-workgro up. (An Iowa Depart-ment of Publi c Health and University of Iowa, Iowa Center f or Public Health Preparedness a c- tion step.) 19.4 Action Step By 2010, coll aborate with other state entities that provi de continu ing ed ucation and training t o coordinate a statewide diss emination of re- sources and programs that enable the health workforce to acce ss trainin g and education to address the needs of persons with disabilities. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health, Univer- sity of Iowa, Iowa Center for Public Health Pre- paredness, an d other state partners actio n step.) 110 Goal Statement Establish a baseline on the number of people served through coordinated transportati on systems , especially rural, and develop strategies to increase the number served and the number of rides provided for increased access to health care and other services in Io wa. Baseline: To be identifi ed. Rationale Transportation was identified as a barrie r to access by the Community Health Ne eds As- sessment and Health I mprovement Plan at the Iowa Department of Publi c Health. According to the executive summary of the National Acad- emies Transit Cooperative Research Program , many rural communities ar e faced with meager transportation fundi ng, m ultiple fundi ng sources and service objectives, li mited services, and in- adequate publ ic interest an d transportati on in- vestments. The report indicates that the best strateg y is to do the best possible with available res ources while seeking additional re sources. Coordina- tion offers strategies to improve the per formance of diverse individual transportation services and overall m obility within a c ommunity . There- fore, this goal addresses rur al and urban areas. Coordinated s ervices may achieve economies of scale not avai lable to small er providers. Iowa will address this problem with the de- velopm ent of the state-level Transportation Co- April 2005 Chap ter 1 - Page 15 of 2 4 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Access to Quality He alth Servic es ordination Council.

Rationale Following t he Institute of Medicine's rec- ommendations to im prove qualit y of car e and the m ission of the National Center of Medical Homes Initiat ives to ensure that children with special needs have acce ss to a medical home, Iowa established the Iowa Medical Ho me Initia- tive. According to t he 2000 Household Health Surve y, 57% of children w ith special health care needs had a medical ho me. This initiat ive fo- cuses on such children and cuts across Healthy Iowans 20 10 chapter area s, including access to quality health care, disabilities, chronic diseases, and m ental h ealth. Children with special healt h care needs have, or are at increased ris k for, a chronic physical, dev elopmental, behavioral, or emo- tional condit ion. T hey require health and related services of a t ype or am ount be yond that re- quired b y children in gener al. The federal Maternal and Child Health Bu- reau, in collaboration with the National Center for Health Statistics, co mpleted a Natio nal Sur- Chap ter 1 - Page 16 of 2 4 April 2005 Access to Quality Health Servic es HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision vey of Children with Special Health Car e Needs in 2001. The survey indicated that approxi- mately 12.8% of U.S. child ren aged 0 to 18 - or 9.4 m illion children - have a special health care need. The survey also noted that approximately one out of fiv e hom es in the United States has a child or youth with special health-care needs, not inclu ding children and youth at risk f or a chronic condi tion. According to the national g roup Health Partners/Insti tute for Health and Disability, chil- dren and youth with special health care needs (CYSHCN) account for 8 0% of pediatric health care expenditures. The annual cost of p rovidin g medical c are to these children was broken down into the following expense areas: Hospitalizati on: home\" care in a high-quality, com prehen sive, and cost-effective manner throug h a pri mary care phy sician in partnership with allied practi- tioners and the fam ily. The Iowa Medical Ho me Initiative (IMHI) was established throu gh collaboration wi th the following partners: Iowa Early ACCESS Pro- gram, Family Voices of Iowa, Child Health Spe- cialty Clinics and its Parent Consultant N etwork, University of Iowa College of Public He alth, Iowa Academy of Fam ily Physicians, Iowa Acade my of Pediatrics, W ellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shi eld of Iowa, Iowa Department of Human Services, Iowa D epartment of Public Health, and Calhoun Co unty Public Health De- partm ent. The IMHI group began working with p ri- mary care pra ctices that ar e striving to im prove using a \"facilitative\" model to im plement medi- cal home ele ments. The Center for Medical Home Improvement establ ished the m odel, which includ es organizational capacity , chronic condition m anagem ent, ca re coordination, and qualit y improvem ent. An IMHI Core Advisor y Group organi zed into work groups t hat will de- velop strategies for change. It will recruit new members to e nsure that the changes are i mple-mented and sustainable. The group will also design and of fer a learning collaborative for a primary medical home model. Future reports will detail the progress of the IMHI Core Advisor y Grou p and particip ating practices in c hanging care for children with spe- cial health ca re needs and its outcom e. Inform a- tion about the IMHI is on t he Iowa Acad emy of Family Physicians web sit e at www.iaaf p.org . At a point in 2010 yet to be determ ined (the an- ticipated end of the project period), an evalua- tion will focus on the effect of m edical home care on sele cted health status and health care utilization var iables. The Iowa team will consult with the Center for Medical Home Im provement on stud y design and anal ysis methods. More details on the medical ho me initiative can be found in the Maternal and Child Health Chapter. 111.1 Action Step Throug h 2010, contin ue to consult with pri- mary care pra ctices intending to im plement a medical ho me model. Evaluate the training and implementati on process and m easure a chieve- ment of medical home status for childre n with special health care needs. Work to change rei m- burse ment an d professional training curricula. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health action step.) 112 Goal Statement Develop a strategic plan to assess and emplo y telehealth and telemedicine that can increase access to quality health services in Iowa. Baseline: See Rationale. Rationale Telehealth and telem edicin e use has grown in the United States in th e past decade. Tech- nologies have improved and the cost of t ele- communication has dro pped.

Accor ding to Iowa Cancer R egistry, an estimated 15,200 Iowans were diagnosed with cancer in 200 4 and 6, 500 died of cancer. With the exception of bladder cancer, these numbers do not include carcinoma in situ (when the cancer is still localized in one place) because the norm is to exclude these cas es in fre quenc y and rate calcu lations. The y also do not include basal and squa mous cell c arcinomas (c ancers of the skin) because the Iowa Cancer R egistry does not collect these data, a s is the practice of most cancer registr ies in the United States. Cancer annually accounts for about 230 of every 1,000 deaths in Iowa and affects Io wans in every county. Althoug h it occurs in peo ple of all ages, during the 1 990s more than 65 % of new cancer s occurred in people aged 65 and older. Four types of cancer most commonly affect Iowans: lung, colorectum , prostate, and fem ale breast. From 1990 through 2002, these types accounted for 57.4% of all incident (new) can- cers and 54% of all cancer deaths. Breas t cancer was the most common fe male canc er, and pros- tate canc er was the most common male cancer. Lung cancer was the leading cause of cancer death, accounting for 27% of all cancer deaths. Cancer incide nce and death rates vary by racial group i n the United States. For some groups, t he rates are higher, indicating t hey are not benefitin g equall y from cancer prevention and control. This is true in Iowa as well where African-Americans have higher m ortalit y rates than whites for lung, fema le breast, colorectu m, and prostate cancers. The num ber of newly diag nosed cancers in Iowa was evaluated to obtain a clearer pi cture of how people with malignant cancers are distrib-uted by race. Cancer death s were also e valuated in a si milar manner and the results were similar.

Over 80% of African-A mericans diagnosed with cancer between 2000 and 200 2 resided in metropolitan statistical area (MSA) counties. In the 2000 census, there were 20 such counties in Iowa: Benton, Black Hawk , Bre mer, D allas, Dubuque, Gr undy, Guthrie , Harrison, Johnson, Jones, Linn, Madison, Mil ls, Polk, Washingto n, Pottawattam ie, Scott, Stor y, Warren, and Wood- bury. Similarly, over half of other races diag- nosed with cancer during t his period resided in MSA counties. However, the absolute num ber of canc ers for other races is much smaller than for whites. The num bers would be eve n lower if limited to site-specifi c cancers (a cancer located in a spe- cific place) a nd result in unreliable rate s. For this reason, baseline canc er rates will be shown for African-Americans and whites in MSA counties onl y. Cancer rat es in rural populations also di ffer from those in urban po pulat ions. Since I owa is considered a rural state, this distinction c an have particular significance to Iowans. One docu- April 2005 Chap ter 2 - Page 1 of 23 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Cancer mented difference is the higher prop ortion of people over a ged 65 in rura l areas. Tobacco use is the leading modifiable ris k factor for cancer. Tob acco-associat ed ca ncers include those in the lung and bronchus, oral cav- ity (excluding lip), esophagus, larynx, pancreas, uterine cervix, urinar y bladder, kidne y, and renal pelvis. Of th e 442,0 00 dea ths annuall y attrib- uted to sm oking in the United States bet ween 1995 and 1 999, 155,700 (3 5%) involved some type of cancer, m ost commonl y lung can cer. The International Agency for Resear ch on Cancer Working Group recently concluded that sufficient evidence exists t o add as toba cco- associat ed ca ncers those occurring in the nasal cavity and pa ranasal sinuses, nasophar ynx, stomach, live r, and m yeloid leukem ia. The es- timated global m ortality due to sm oking in 2000 was 4.84 m illion (2.41 m illion in developing nations and 2.43 m illion in developed). Alcohol cons umption is also a known ri sk factor for cancers of the oral cavity (exc luding lip), esophagus, and lar ynx, and t o a lesser ex- tent, liver. O ngoing resear ch indicates that die- tary factors and phy sical activity may play an important role in the occurrence of so me can- cers. Other i mportant risk factors include exces- sive sunlight exposure for skin m elanoma and genetic predisposition for breast c ancer. These risk factors ar e dealt with in other chapters of Healthy Iowans 201 0. Objectives in those chap- ters will support som e of the action steps in this chapter. Cancer incidence reveals more about risk factors in the populati on than cancer mortality because cancer mortality data also reflect out- comes of can cer scr eening practices and cancer treatment. Widely accep ted cancer s creening guidelines exist for cancers of the fe male breast, ute rine cervix, and colorectum . Recommended screen- ing tests include ma mmography and clinical breast exa mination for female breast c ancer, Pa- panicolaou (Pap) tests for c ancer of the uterine cervix, and fecal occult blood tests, sigmoido- scopy canc er. The prim ary objec- tive of these screening tests is to reduce site-specific cancer mortality by detecting cancer at an earlier sta ge. Some of these tests, esp ecially the Pap test, mammography, erous lesions. This can also lead to a reduction in s ite-specific malignant (or invasive) cancer incide nce rates. For these reasons, canc er incidence-r elated action steps will be included with cancer m ortality (death) goals. Progress Over 40 ty pes of cancer ar e typically re- ported b y the Iowa Cancer Registry and the Na- tional Cancer Institute. In this chapter, besides all sites, particular attention is given t o the more common canc er sites and si tes where modifiable risk factors have been identified and/or s creen- ing guideline s are widely accepted. Bet ween 1994 to 1996 and 200 0 to 2002, all target ed can- cer site s in Iowa showed im prove ment in m ortal- ity rates. For all sites, cancer mortality declined 4%. Fe male breast and prostate canc ers, the most common cancers in wo men and men, showed im provements of 17% and 19 %, respec- tively.

Ca ncer incidence rates reflect progress in this area . Iowans want early detection, an early measure of which is the stage distributio n. They also wa nt inform ation on quantit y and qualit y of life once diagnos ed with cancer and effective treat ment, rehabilitation and quality care. Survival rates directl y measure quantity of life and indir ectly measure qualit y of lif e. The cancer mortality rate provides the num ber of lives lost to cancer relative to the p opula tion at risk. It can be affect ed by changes in the inci- dence rate, stage distributi on, or sur vival rate.

In this review, additional cancer sites, in- cluding non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma, uterine, ovarian, and testicular c ancers, wer e considered but not included because there are no est ab- lished, effective, endorsed guidelines for their prevention. In 200 2, the Iowa Consortium for Co mpre- hensive Cancer Control, w hich includes more than 100 people representi ng 50 agencies and organizations around t he state, developed a comprehensi ve state plan to change the face of cancer in Iowa. Through t he consortium , citi- zens, leaders and m any institutions are working together to re duce the burden of cancer. The state co mprehensive cancer control plan fully supports the c ancer goals in this Healthy Iowans 2010 chapter. The goals of I owa's Com prehensive Can cer Control Plan are: Whenever possible, prevent cancer fro m occurring; When cancer does occur, find it in its earli- est stages; When cancer is found, treat it with the most appropriate th erapy ; Assure that the quality of life for every can- cer patient is the best possible; and Move researc h findings m ore quickly into prevention an d control.

Rationale Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States and Iowa. Fro m 1990 to 2002 , cancers of the lu ng, c olorectum , female breast, and prostate accounted for a majority of the cancer de aths in Iowa. Cancer mortality for som e cancer s are si g- nificantly reduced by early detection and inter- vention. The goals in this c hapter directly deal with breast, c ervical, colorectal, melanoma, cers, as as initiatives in environm ental health (Chapter 6), nutriti on (Chapter 13 ), oral health (Chapter 15), phy sical activity and fitness (Chapter 16), and tobacco use (Chapter 21), ad- dress canc er.

Baseline: 1994 to 1996 ag e-adju sted rate of 467.3 100,00 0; 2000 to age-adju rse ra te of 479.3 pe r 100,000; 201 0 goal revised u pward from 417 p er 100,00 0 to be tter reflect an achievable g oal. Rationale The potential for reducing cancer incide nce through prim ary prevention appears to be exten- sive. Lifesty le, occupation al, genetic, and - indi vidually or in combina- tion - can increase a perso n's risk of de veloping cancer. Curr ently, reductions in tobacco use and dietary modifications have the greatest potential to reduce cancer incidence and, ultim ately, mor- tality . The A merican Cancer Society the National Cancer Instit ute, the Centers for Disea se Control and Prevention, the Iowa Cancer Registr y, the Iowa Department of Publi c Health, and other organizations provi de im portant inform ation on cancer preven tion. The Iowa Consortium for Comprehensi ve Cancer Co ntrol also uses this inform ation to establish cancer control i nitiatives and priorities. An overall reduction i n incidence will be achieved primarily through the action steps listed in the site-specific sections.

April 2005 Chap ter 2 - Page 7 of 23 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Cancer Rationale Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death among both men and women in Iowa and in t he United States. In 200 4 in Iowa, an estim ated 1,73 0 persons (1,04 0 men and 6 90 women) died from lung cancer, accounting for 27% of all cancer deaths. Am ong Iowa men, annual age-adjusted lung cancer mortality rates have declined since 1990. Between 199 4 to 1996 and 2000 to 2002, the decline in these rat es was 9%. Ove r this sa me period, annual age- adjusted lung cancer mortality rates for Iowa women incre ased by 1%. During 19 94 to 19 96 in Iowa, age-adjusted lung cancer m ortality rates were 85% h igher among African-Am erican men than white men. This decreased to 6 9% higher for 20 00 to 2002. Between 199 4 and 1 996, rates were 6% higher among white wo men than am ong African- American wo men, but duri ng 2000 t o 2002 the rate increased to 72% higher among African- American wo men than white wo men. Lung cancer accounted for an esti mated 13% of all newly diagnose d cancers in Iowa in 2004 . An estim ated 2,020 persons (1,15 0 men and 870 women) were newly diagn osed with the disease. This will make lung cancer the second most common cancer in men (trailing prostate cancer) and t he third m ost common canc er in women (traili ng breast and colorectal can cers). Based on Iowa Cancer R egistry inform ation, annual age-adjusted lung cancer incidence rates for men declined since 198 8. Between 1994 t o 1996 and 2 000 to 2002, the decline was 11%. In contrast, over this sa me period annual age- adjusted lung cancer incide nce rates in I owa women increased 6%. Bet ween 1994 to 1996 and 200 0 to 2002 i n Iowa, age-adjusted lung cancer incide nce rates incr eased fro m 49% to 69% higher a mong African-Am erican men than white men, but decreased f rom 26% to 15% higher am ong African-American wo men than white wo men. Cigarette sm oking is t he most im portant risk factor for lung cancer, acc ounting nationally for 87% of lun g cancer deaths. During 2002, ciga- rette use in adult Iowans was 23.2% (26.3% in males and 20. 3% in fem ales). For the sa me year, cigarette use in Iowa' s youth aged 1 8 to 24 was 32.3% . Other forms of tobacco, such as cigars and environm ental to- bacco sm oke, are risk facto rs for lung ca ncer as well, as are occupational exposures (e.g. , asbes- tos) and indoor and outdoor air polluti on (e.g., Lung Can cer Mort ality, 1990 -2002 4045505560 199019911992 1993 1994199519961997 1998 199920002001 2002Lung cancer mortality Iowa 2010 Goal Healthy People 2010 5% reduction YearRate per 100,000 Chap ter 2 - Page 8 of 23 April 2005 Cancer HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision radon and environm ental t obacco sm oke). After tobacco, radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer. In 200 1 in the U.S., 15 6,000 peo- ple died of lung cancer. An esti mated 1 8,000 of these deaths were attribute d to radon, com pared to 135,000 attributed to tobacco. Lung-cancer m ortality stati stics closely par- allel lung-cancer incidence statistics because survival rates are low, with 5-y ear relative sur- vival rates at 13.8% for Io wans diagnosed with lung cancer b etween 1995 and 200 0. There are no recommen ded screening tests for the early diagnosis of l ung cancer in asymptomatic per- sons. Most people are diagnosed at an advanced stage. From 1995 to 2000 in I owa, 16% , 35% and 39% of lung cancer s wer e detected in ea rly, re- gional and distant stages, r espectively . The strategy for r educing lu ng cancer deaths is to reduce lung c ancer incidence through delay ing tobacco use by m inors and through sm oking ces- sation. 24.1 Action Step By 2010, dec rease lung cancer incidence to a rate of no more than 52. 7 per 100, 000 ( 1994 to 1996 age-adjusted baseline rate: 68.4 per 100,000; 2000 to 2 002 m rate: 65.7 per 100,000) by supporti ng the follow- ing goals and action steps for changing envi- ronm ents and social norms that support tobacco use and reductions in resid ential radon exposure. 1.

Note: MSA = metropolitan statis- tical area. April 2005 Chap ter 2 - Page 9 of 23 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Cancer Rationale Breast cancer is by far the most common cancer among Iowa wo men, with an estimated 2,250 new cases expect ed to have occurred in 2004 (Iowa Cancer Registry ). An estimated 460 women died from breast ca ncer in 2004, ac- counting for 15% of all cancer deaths am ong Iowa wo men. The m ortalit y rate rem ained rela- tively stable from 1973 to 1992; howev er, it has been declinin g since 1992 . The data for 2000 to 2002 show a highe r age-adjusted m ortality in residents of non-MSAs (metropolitan statistical areas) than in MSA counties. Due to the small size of Iowa' s minor- ity po pulatio n, and t he consequent small num ber of breast canc er deaths a mong m inority women, breast cancer mortality rates for Iowa' s minority populati ons are difficult to interpret. Th e data also indicate that two-thirds of all female breast cancer deaths in Iowa occurred am ong women aged 65 years and older. On average, a woman' s lifetime risk of de- veloping breast cancer is o ne in seven. For pri- mary prevention, overweight is an established risk factor for breast cancer in postm enopausal women, prob ably due to their higher lev els of circulating estrogen. Mortalit y can be reduced substantiall y if a tumor is disc overed at an early stage (in situ and/or localized incidence). Mammograph y on a regular basis is the most effective method for detecting these malignancie s early . Clinical tri- als de monstra te that ma mmography can reduce breast canc er deaths by 20% to 39% in women aged 50 to 74 and about 17% in wo men aged 40 to 49. Although the best tool in t he fight against female breast cancer is e arly detection, e arly stage breast c ancer is not being detected at the same rate in all seg ments of Iowa's population. Overall, wo men in m etropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) have breast canc er detected earl y at slightl y higher rates than women in non- MSAs. Although the actual num ber of cases is l ow - making interp retation difficult - t he 199 4 to 1996 baseline data indicate that non-whit e women in MSAs have much lower earl y inci- dence detecti on rates than white wo men in MSAs. Much can be done to red uce the burden of breast canc er through early detection by regular mammography. Su ggested intervals for screen- ing var y depending on age and other risk s.

Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) data highlight the discrepanci es in mammography screening for Iowa wo men aged 40 and older when self-rep orting their adherence to screening guidelines. O verall, 76.8% of Iowa women aged 40 and older r eported in 2 002 re- ceiving a ma mmogra m during the preceding two years. However, seg ments of the p opula tion are screen ed disproportio nately, includ ing women with annual h ousehold i ncomes of $20,0 00 or less (70.9% are not available due to the small number of such persons in the sam ple. The m ost frequent reasons reported b y women for not havin g breast cancer screening are lack of a physician recommendation and the belief that a mammogram is not needed or not indicated in the absence of symptoms. Educa- tion of both the physician and the patient can improve mamm ography screening rates. Since ph ysician reco mmen dation is o ne of the strongest predictors of breast canc er screen- ing, one strategy to increase the likelihood of a physician recommendation is the use of an office reminder sy stem . Althoug h several studies on the mailing of general infor mation about breast cancer screening to wom en have shown some increase s in screening, the effect has ty pically been lim ited to a short-term increase in ma m- mography use. A more prom ising appr oach has been to tailor messages to t he indivi dual. 25.1 Action Step By 2010, increase the per centage of breast cancer s diagnosed at an ear ly stage (in situ and localized) to 75% (1994 to 1996 baseline rate: 69.0% ; 2000 to 20 02 rate: 70.5% , Iowa Cancer Registry , State Health Regi stry of Iowa). Acco mplish by increasing to at least 85% the percentage of women aged 40 an d older who will have had a mammogram in the preceding one to two years.

There is general agree ment on the im portance of screening women on a regular basis for cervical cancer. With early detection through screening, plus appropr iate and timely treatm ent, survival can be alm ost 100% . Unfortunately, not all Iowa wo men are screen ed to an equal extent.

In 2 004 i n the Un ited States, an esti- mated 146,940 new cases of colorectal cancer were diagnosed and an estimated 56,730 deaths occurred. In Iowa in 200 4, an estim ated 2,10 0 new cases were diagnosed and an estim ated 740 deaths occurred. The one- and five-y ear relative survival rates for patients with colorectal cancer ar e 82.8% and 65.9%, respectively . Whe n colorectal cancers are detect ed in an early , localized stag e, the 5- year relative survival rate is 95%; however, onl y 39% of colorectal c ancers are discovere d at an early stage. After the can cer has spre ad region- ally to involve adjacent organs or ly mph nodes, the survival r ate drops to 7 0%; another 37% of colorectal can cers ar e diagnosed at this stage. The survival rate for persons with distant metas- tases is only 10%, with 18% of colorectal can- cers ar e diagnosed at this stage.

This has been linked to the increasing incidence of obe sity. This alar ming trend is affecting adults , but more disturbing is that it is now affecting teen -aged and younger children. For this reason, many of the goals of this chapter have been revised and the approach toward managem ent and prevention will focus on different p opulatio ns and age grou ps. What is Diabetes? Diabetes mellitus is a group of diseases characterized by high bl ood glucose (sug ar) re- sulting from defects in insulin pr oducti on, insu- lin action, or both. It can be associ ated with se- rious com plications and pr emature death. How- ever, people with diabetes can control the dis- ease and lower the risk of complications. (Na- tional Diabetes Fact Sheet by the Centers for Disea se Control and Preve ntion.) Magnitude of Diabetes Diabetes is a chronic disease that is ap- proaching epi demic proportions, affecting m ore than 18. 2 million peo ple in the United St ates, or 6.3% of the t otal pop ulatio n. More than 13 m il- lion peo ple live with the b urden of diabetes and another 5.2 m illion have the disease and don' t know it. I n Iowa, diabetes affects the lives of an estimated 148,410 people, according to t he 2003 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sy stem (BRFSS), or 6.7 % of all I owans. The disease strikes certain m inority populations dispr opor- tionatel y, with higher incidence in Native Americans, H ispanics and African-A mericans. It requires daily m anagement to m aintain glu- cose levels w ithin an disablin g and life-threatening complica-tions. In addit ion, qualit y of life is greatly af- fected by diabetes. Skyrocketing costs accompany the epi- demic, with a n estimated t otal cost in the U.S. of $132 billion. Of this, direct medical costs ac- count for $92 billion. The remaining $40 billion are indirect costs and include disabilit y, work loss, and premature mortality. The Levin Group, Inc., on behalf of th e American Diabetes Association, bases this dat a on a study showing that in Iowa i n 2002, t otal costs for in-patient diabetes-related hospitalizations were $741 ,483,180. This total d id not include outpa- tient services or phy sician charges. Guidelines for Care The standards for optim al clinical manage- ment of people with diabetes are include d in the American Diabetes Association: Clin ical Prac- tice Recom mendations 1999. on the Am erican Diabete s Associa- tion (ADA) web site. All health enco uraged to follow these reco mmen- dations. Types of Di abetes Type 1 diabetes wa s previously called insu- lin-dependent diabetes (IDDM), or juve nile on- set diabetes. Type 1, usually described as an autoimm une disease, devel ops when the body' s immune sy stem destroy s pancreatic beta cells, the onl y cells that make the horm one insulin which regulates blood gl ucose. This for m of diabetes usually strikes children and young adults, although disease onset can occur at any age. Type 1 diabetes may account for 5 % to 10% of all diagnosed diabetes c ases. Risk fac- include autoi ronm ental factors. Type 2 diabet es was previously called no n- insulin dependent diab etes mellitus (NIDDM), or adult-o nset diabetes. Type 2 m ay account f or April 2005 Chap ter 3 - Page 1 of 16 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Diabetes about 9 0% to 95% of all di agnosed diab etes cases. It usually begins as insulin resistance, a disorder in w hich the cells do not use ins ulin properly . As the need for insulin rises, the pan- creas graduall y loses its ability to produce insu- lin. Type 2 diabetes is a ssociated with older age, obesity and f amily histor y of diabetes. The United Kingd om Prospective Diabetes Stud y followed 5,1 02 patients with newly diag nosed Type 2 diabetes for an average of 10 years. The study dem onstrated that lo wering bloo d glucose reduces the incidence of micro-vascular compli- cations. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) followed two groups of Type 1 patients on a l ong-term basis, with one gr oup treated conventionall y and the other inte nsively. The stud y demonstrated that lowering bl ood- glucose concentration slo ws or prevents long- term development of diabetic co mplications. The A merican Diabetes A ssociation guidelines reflect the findings of these studies. The guide- lines must be given to health care provid ers with a message tha t emphasize s their im porta nce. However, it is equally important that individual- ized treat ment goals be established for children with Ty pe 1 diabetes, and m ore recently, chil- dren with T ype 2 diabetes. These treat ment goals should take into ac- count the effects of one's a ge, lifesty le, growth, and other b ody changes in t he child and youth , especially at pubert y or du ring pregnanc y. A team , including the child , parents, ph ysicians, school nutriti onist, and nurse, must provide care of children w ith diabetes in school or in child care settings. Siblings of persons with Type 1 diabetes are c onsidered at-risk for the dis ease and shoul d be monitored. To m inimize the ef- fects of the disease, early diagnosis and i nitia- tion of treatment should occur. Screening ac- cording t o the following ris k factors is appropri- ate and encouraged, especi ally in a clinic setting. However, most insurers do not reim burse for it. Risk factors f or type 2 diabetes include: Family histor y of diabetes. Obesity . Racial and/or ethnic heritage. African- Americans, H ispanic A mericans, A merican In- dians, Asian A mericans, a nd Pacific Islanders have a higher risk. Age over 45. Previous im paired glucose tolerance or im- paired fasting glucose (now called pre- diabetes). Hypertension (equal to or greater than 140/9 0 mm Hg). High-densit y lipoprotei n equal to or less than 35 m g/dl and/or trigl yceride levels of 250 mg/dl. History of ge stational diabetes mellitus or delivery of a baby weighin g more than nine poun ds. Sedentary lifestyle. Type 2 diabet es can be delay ed or preven ted by maintaining norm al weight and being active. Proper nutriti on and physical activity to reduce its incidence should be widely encouraged for adults and children alike. Treating Diabetes To survive, people with Type 1 diabetes must have insulin b y injecti on or pump. People with T ype 2 diabetes can control t heir bl ood glucose b y following a health y meal plan and exercise progra m, losing excess w eight, and tak- ing oral m edications. Many people with diabe- tes also need to take medications to cont rol their cholesterol and blood pressure. Diabetes self- management education is an integral co mponent of medical care. Am ong adults with dia gnosed diabetes, 12% take both i nsulin and oral medica- tions, 19% take insulin only, 53% take o ral medications onl y, and 15% do not take either insulin or oral medications. Progress Diabetes ha s increased in Iowa to a self- reported prevalence of 6.7%. This co mpares to 4.7% in 1990, 4% in 19 95, and 6.1% in 2000 . The risk of diabetes incre ases with age. One in seven Iowans over aged 65 report having the disease. Hig her rates ar e also seen a mong peo- ple with less than a high school education, who earn less than $25,000 per year, and who are African-American. The state of Iowa has long been concerned about diabete s and its complications. In 1985, Iowa was one of the first states to establi sh dia- betes outpatient education program s. Toda y, Iowa continues to support these programs. This Chap ter 3 - Page 2 of 16 April 2005 Diabetes HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision certification process is a r equirement for pay - ment for outpatient diabetes education classe s by the state' s Medicaid progra m. The Iowa legisla- ture passed a law that mandates pay ment by all Iowa-based i nsurers for outpatient education services provided by certified program s. This past y ear legislation was introduced in the Iowa House to reduce some of the mandated service cover age area s for certain diagnoses, including some diabetes areas. Fortunately , the bill did not make it out of c ommittee. T his could have ha d a major im pact on services to Iowans with diabetes. The issue also rec eived national attention and stro ng supp ort fro m small business organizations. The Iowa Depar tment of Public Health established the Diabetes P reven- tion and C ontrol Program (DPCP) in 19 95 to build a structure for statew ide efforts to prom ote awar eness of the disease, p rovide access to qual- ity care, and im prove quality of life by pr even- tion of com plications. 2003 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sy stem surve y. Goal Statements & Action Steps 31 Goal S tatement Increase aw areness o f diabetes in peo- ple with pre-diabetes risk and those with undiagnosed diabetes. Limit the upw ard prevalence trend of diabetes to 0.2% per year. Baseline, 2003: 6.7 % of Iowans are di - agno sed with diabete s (Behavioral Risk Facto r Surveillance System). 2003 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sy stem surve y. Rationale This effort can prevent or delay the onset of diabetes in people with pre -diabetes and prevent or delay complications for those who are diag- nosed and receiving treatment and self- management education. T he epidem ic requires a significant increas e in prevention. The increas e in diabetes mirrors the gr owth of obesit y in the United States and Iowa. The need to refocus our efforts is apparent as the num ber of people wi th diabetes in Iowa continues to c limb. Since 1995, a 2 4% increase in the rate of diabetes has occurred in Iowa, ac- cording t o the 2003 Behavioral Risk Factor Sur- veillance Sy stem (BRFSS). It is estim ated that rd of peo ple with diabetes are u ndiagnosed. The num ber of peo- ple with the disease in creases as the population ages. Those who are undi agnosed are at great risk of developing com plications. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial dem onstrated that intensive therapy resulted in a dela y in the onset and a major slowing of the progression of the three co mplications studied. Over the seven years of the study , there we re reductions of ap- proxim ately 60% in risk of retinopath y, neph- ropath and neuropath y. It is obvio us that preventio n is a very impor- tant goal at this ti me. If the trends of obe sity and subsequent early onset of t ype 2 dia betes is not reversed, the econom ic and societal im pact for Iowa will be staggering and unprecedented. As ty pe 2 diabetes strikes youn ger and youn ger people, the incidence and severity of com plica- tions will occur earlier and possibl y last l onger. April 2005 Chap ter 3 - Page 3 of 16 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Diabetes Several progra ms are in place to help people increase phy sical activity and lose weight (see chapters 9, 13 and 16). The Iowa Diabet es Pre- vention an d Control Pro gram collaborates with the A merican Diabetes A ssociation, the Iowa Diabetes Network, other D epartm ent of Public Health programs, health syste ms, and other or- ganizations th at include disparity gro ups and those at the local level. The resources and energy of the Iowa Dia- betes Prevent ion and Contr ol Program will be redirected toward prevention while cont inuing to target early diagnosis, education and dise ase management. The pre-diabetes diagnosis provides an o p- portunit y to prevent or delay diabetes. Studies have found that lifesty le changes can prevent or delay the ons et of t ype 2 diabetes among high- risk adults. These studies i ncluded people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and oth er risk factors for developing diabetes. Lifesty le changes included diet m odifications and m oder- ate intensity physical activity (e.g., walking for 2\u00bd hours each week). In t he Iowa Diab etes Pre- vention an d Control Pro gram, a large prevention study of peop le at high risk for diabetes, the de- velopm ent of diabetes wa s reduced by 58% over three y ears by lifesty le changes. Steps to m otivate changes include aware ness of risk factors for pre-diabetes and diabetes and the mess age t hat with positive lifesty le changes, diabetes can be prevented or delay ed. People diagnosed with diabetes ca n manage their dis- ease with appropriate self- manage ment educa- tion in a variety of settings. High-risk p opula- tions shoul d especially be targeted. The m ost nu merous minority po pulatio ns in Iowa are Afri can-A meric an and Hispanic. The Native American populatio n is also at very high risk for diabe tes, but this g roup is sm all in Iowa. These minority groups need to be aware of their high risk f or developing diabetes. Also, their medical providers must be alert to the impor- tance of screening f or diab etes and watching f or signs of the diseas e. The mess age that diabetes is co mmon, se ri- ous, costly , and controllable has been tes ted by the National Diabetes Edu cation Program (NDEP) and proven effective with pop ulations at highest risk. The NDEP also developed m e- dia cam paigns. By participating in this program and using developed m aterials, message s can be provided to the correct populations in a cultur- ally sensitive way. Screening hig h-risk people to pro vide early diagnosis and subsequent treatment and control will result in a decrease in co mplications. At events such as the annual ADA Al ert Day , par- ticipants' risk for diabetes is evaluated a nd high- risk people referred for testing. T here is now no central place to post such inform ation to enable people with interest in diabetes to acce ss it. A specific w eb site has been recommende d, with all interested parties sending inform ation about screening or educational programs to that site. Early detection and treatme nt can decrea se complications and early death; therefore, efforts should be made to screen those at highe st risk. A variety of measures to identif y people at high risk is available and should be expanded t o populati ons at risk. It is assu med that more peo- ple would be screen ed if all insurance ca rriers covered this test. Diagnosis at an early stage, when control could prevent com plications, is delay ed when there is a lack of reim bursem ent for routine screening of pe rsons at risk for diabe- tes. If the inexpensive blood glucose test was reimbursed, it could result in increased discov- ery and referral for diagnos is of many sympto- matic and undiagnosed pe ople. Many organiz ations in Iow a are recognizing the need to ke ep health care providers informed about the risi ng epidem ic of diabetes. Several educational sem inars were provi ded in I owa dur- ing 2004, many of which were billed as \"annual\" updates. Iowa State University and ISU Exten- sion pro vided inform ation on the m etabolic syn- drom e. The University of Iowa provide d a dia- betes update, including recent resear ch inform a- tion, and Iow a Health Sy stem joined with the Mercy Network to pr ovide inform ation on dia- betes to health care provid ers. The Iowa Foun- dation for Me dical Care co ntinues to provide its annual qualit y forum with one of three b reakout sessions focu sing totally on diabetes. The Iowa Departm ent of Public Health (IDPH) colla borates every other with nearly 30 non- governm ental entities at the \"Barn Raising.\" The primary focus is Chap ter 3 - Page 4 of 16 April 2005 Diabetes HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision public health in Iowa. The Iowa Public Health Association partners annually with the I owa En- vironm ental Health Association to bring health care providers together to i ncrease their knowl- edge in m any areas of public health. The Iowa Diabetes Network and the Iowa Diabete s Pre- vention an d Control Pro gram continue providi ng quarterly educational progr ams on diabetes for health care professionals. In 200 4, the Wellm ark Foundation an- nounced t hat its was focusing fun ding on the Institute of M edicine's (IOM) publication, Pri- ority Areas for National Ac tion: Transfo rming Health Care Quality , which includes dia betes and areas that could directly im pact peo ple with diabetes. In 2004 , Wellmark awarded more than $150 ,000 to projects working to m ake an im pact on diabetes. Also in 2004, the Diabetes Prevention and Control Progr am conducted an assessment of Iowa' s Diabetes He alth Syste m using the 10 es- sential servic es for ass essment. Focusing on strengths and areas that nee ded im provement, the following service gaps were identified: 1. No central agency or clearingho use exists for the collection, anal ysis and dissem ination of diabetes-relat ed inform ation and resources. (This include d a strong recommendation for the Iowa Department of Publi c Health's Diabetes Prevention an d Control Program to em ploy an epidem iologi st to manage data.) 2. More em phasis is needed on preventio n (in- cluding pre-diabetes), struc and reim- burse iss ues. This includes increas ed rei m- bursem ent for prim ary care providers, wit h more focus on rewarding p hysicians for doin g a good job rather tha n reim bursement based on the need for the patient to return several ti mes for addi- tional care, and pro viding reimbursement for other diabetes services such as diabetes e duca- tion b y dietici ans and RNs. 3. Collaboration among all partners needs to be strengthened and form alized, possibl y using the current Iowa Diabetes Network as an um brella organization. 4. Marketing and pu blic infor mation need strengthening . This inclu des izing and m arketing the Diabetes Preven tion and Control Pro gram web site. 5. Cultural diver sity requires continued att en- tion. 6. Rural Iowa needs more services for diabet- ics, including prim ary care collaboration. In October 2 004, the University of Io wa's School of M edicine was awarded a $21 m illion grant from the National Institute of Health to help study diabetes. 31.1 Action Step By 2010, ann ually pro vide 10 comm unity program s to i ncreas e the focus on education and awar eness of diabetes, identification of risk fac- tors, pre-diabetes, and prevention.

Baselin e: See Ration ale. Rationale Based on stat istics the A merican Dia- betes As socia \"Diabetes Statistics \" and the Centers for D isease Control and Prevention (CDC) \" National Estimate s on Diabetes ,\" cer- tain racial an d ethnic populations, the elderly , rural residents, and the econom ically disadvan- taged are disproportio nately affected by diabetes and its serious co mplicatio ns. The prevalence of diabetes in Hispanic whites is 12.5 m illion, or 8.4 % of all n on-Hispanic whites aged 20 or older who ha ve diabetes. For African- Americans, t he prevalence is approxim ately 2.7 million, or 11.4 % of those aged 20 or older. However, one-third of the m do not kno w it. For the Latino-Hispanic popula tion, appr oximately 2 million, or 8.2 % of all Latino Am ericans aged 20 or older, h ave diabetes. For Native American Chap ter 3 - Page 6 of 16 April 2005 Diabetes HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision and Alaska Native populati ons, 14 .9 % who re- ceived care fr om Indian He alth Services have diabetes, or 110,8 14 perso ns. Minority communities are characte rized by the following: Greate r prevalence of diabetes re sulting in higher m ortality, am putations and com plications from this dise r serio usness of diabetes (e.g., hyper- glycemia is worse or other serious co-morbid conditions such as hypertension exist to com pli- cate the prese nce of diabetes). Inadequate ac cess to proper diabetes preven- tion and control programs. If diabetes se rvices such as educa tion and e ye evaluation are not available, then efficacious program s to r educe the burden of diabetes will not be accessed and used. Improper qualit y of care. Even if diabe tes management were available, if its qualit y is in- adequate, prevention wo uld not be effective. Iowa' s minority po pulation s are growing more rapidly than its Caucasian populati on. Mi- norities are located in both rural and urb an communities. Smaller co mmunities may be less prepared to provide services for minorities. Language is also a barrier to care, especially for health care providers without appropriate written materi al or interpreters. Interpretation services are not plentiful in rural areas, espe cially for medical terms. It is also di fficult to find written materials in the appropriat e language, th ough not all people read in their native language. Federal agencies ar e often clearinghouses for such mate- rials. Linkin g them with providers coul d dra- matic ally reduce disparities and enable providers to relate better to their clients. Minorit y populations are scattered through- out the state. They live in rural areas tha t are far from diabete s centers or ce rtified diabetes outpa- tient education program s. Minorities oft en have difficult y communicating and are medically un- derserved, uninsured or u nderinsured; th erefore, they need pre vention, screening and treatment. One solution is to take screening activiti es to communities to help provide acce ss to s creening and referral for care. Problem s also include pub- lic transportation, which is available in some areas, but not others. In some co mmunities, the only transp ortation is b y school bus and area agency -on-aging trolle y systems. A possible solution is to he lp health care providers ide ntify barriers to care and locate lo- cal resource s, followed by strategies to provide other needed services to overco me the se barri- ers. Me mbers of any population with an acce ss problem should be include d in pr oblem identifi- cation, determining possi ble solutions, and se- lecting the best solution for their areas. For ex- ample, seniors in rural areas frequently l ack pub- lic transportation or f unds t o pay for drivers. However, public health nu rsing services are available in all 99 Iowa counties for home health care. With recent budget c uts and decreased state funding, some agencies have had to reduce services. Undocum ented residents may also hav e dif- ficulty acces sing care. Many organizations that provide fu nding, inclu ding the Iowa Medicaid program and many county governm ent agencies, cannot use state or count y funds for undocu- mented perso ns. Agencies m ust often depend on special grants or refer to free clinics or c ommu- nity health centers to provide services fo r un- docum ented and u ninsured. In 200 4, six c ommunity health centers were available acro ss Iowa, so me of which have the designation by the Centers for Diseas e Control and Prevention (CDC) of a \"diabetes coll abora- tive.\" Diabetes collaboratives collect an d subm it data to help measure the im pact of diabetes on Iowa. These centers should be targeted for as- sessment of problems and assist ance in develop- ing solutions. Acce ss to se rvices may also be difficult for c are providers. Travel to large met- ropolitan areas for required education may pre- vent som e providers from participating i n a cer- tified outpatie nt education program . Providers who participate in a com prehen- sive education curriculum and who have profes- sional and pe er support are able to dem onstrate greater skills, knowledge, motivation, and sup- port to m anage the disease.

Cultural competency training is becom ing more importa nt for health c are professio nals. Some cultures may respond negatively to the phrases, mannerisms and c ustoms of Midwest- ern culture. To un derstand and n ot offe nd, health care providers m ust be knowledge able and sensitive about patient responses. Providing cultural infor mation to providers may improve health care an d com pliance . People with disabilities should also have easy access t o all health care facilities. Existing laws help, but continual vigilance is nece ssary to ensure that they are im plemented. Many people with diabetes have special needs due to compli- cations such as blindness caused by retinopathy and m obility problem s from neuropathy or lower limb amputation. Most health care facilit ies provide accommodations for clients with dis- abilities. Technology advances have also helped people with diabetes mana ge the disease with insulin pum ps, special sy ringes for the visually impaired, and glucose m onitors that requ ire minute am ounts of blo od that can be obt ained from many sites. However, people with limited income and no health cove rage often are not able to use them . Most hom e delivered meal program s, senior meals centers, airlines, conferences, conven- tions, and restaurants offer special menus for people with diabetes. Low or no calorie soft drinks and other food, an d non-caloric sweeten- ers for cookin g, can also help people m anage diabetes. Becaus e of the extensive im pact of diabetes, there are many shared goals across Heal thy Io- wans 201 0 chapters. Co mmunication and col- laboration among partners is essential, especially with lim ited r esources. Exa mples of suc h chap- ters are heart disease and stroke, disabilities, vision, imm unizations, mental health, n utrition, oral health, phy sical activities, and the new chapter on vi sion. 32.1 Action Step By 2006, dev elop and im plem ent specific strategies to i ncreas e acc ess to care.

Baseli ne: See Ration ale. Rationale Evidence has long existed a nd now is further supported t hat monitoring practitioners' practice behaviors encourages greater attention to indica- tors of early organ damage. Behaviors in clude blood pressure monitoring, and e ye and foot ex- aminations. Better secondary and tertiary pre- vention will a lso discover signs of com plications early . These behaviors should also be moni- tored. During the pa st decade, res earch has e stab- lished that controlling certain macro-vascular risks such as blood glucose will result in fewer diabetes-relat ed com plications. Further, identi- fication of early indicators of organ damage (e.g., m icro-album inuria) and pro per treatm ent with ACE-inhibitors will reduce progression to renal failure. These quality indicators of diabe- tes prevention and contr ol should be m onitored. Activities ultimately decided by the patient are es sential i n preventing diabetes. Re presenta- tive indivi dual behaviors th at should be periodi- cally monitored include smoking , use of aspirin, and self-bloo d glucose m onitoring . The Ameri- can Diabete s Association reco mmendati ons, up- dated annuall y (199 9, updated in 20 04), encour- age aspirin therapy as secondar y prevent ion in diabetic men and women who have evi dence of large vessel d isease. It should also be us ed as primary prev ention in high-risk men and women with t ype 1 or type 2 diabetes with fam ily histo- ries of coronary heart disease, cigarette smoking, hypertension, obesit y, albu minuria (m icro or macro), and for various lip id criteria. This lipid criterion include s cholesterol greater than 200 m g/dl, lo w density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol greater than 130 mg/dl, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol less than 40 m g/dl, and trigly cerides greater than 150m g/dl. T he erican Diabetes Association also reco mmends a m inimum of one foot exam i- nation ann ually. Diabetes pati ent education is uniform ly viewed as effective and econom ical in prevent- ing longer-term complicati ons of diabetes. A person with diabetes spend s less than 0.5% of his or her time in contact with the health care system , and thus m ust make a variety of critical decisions about diabetes on a daily basis. There- April 2005 Chap ter 3 - Page 9 of 16 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Diabetes fore, an informed and motivated patient is ess en- tial, and diab etes educatio n shoul d be monitored. Diabetes control is best achieved through a team consisti ng of t he physician, nurse, dietitian, pharmacist, o ther professionals, and the patient. Health car e providers m ust have acce ss to the most current medical pra ctices and to patient care instructi on. In Iowa, primary health care professionals provide m anagement of diabetes. To m eet the goals of preventing l ong-ter m com- plications, it i s essential to provide curre nt in- formation to all medical practitioners in Iowa. The Iowa Dia betes Resourc e Directory , first developed an d distributed in 1998, is also im por- tant. It contai ns inform ation about state pro- gram s, specific count y data and services avail- able to peopl e with diabetes, and a listing of l o- cal resources. The directory will be m ade avail- able throug h the Iowa Departm ent of Pub lic Health web page to provide state wide a ccess. Providing tools for the health care provider to docum ent an d follow progress of a patient will result in m ore efficient and effective pati ent management. The person with diabetes is the most im portant m ember of the team , providing day-to-da y manage ment of the disease. Re- sources to help keep track of blood glucose, regular exam inations, and diet are helpful and should be available. Current standards developed b y the Ameri- can Diabete s Association, based on the Report of the Expert Committee on the Diagnosis a nd Classification of Diabetes Mellitus , have been distributed to 2,800 prim ary care ph ysicians and internists in I owa. Follow -up and reinf orcem ent throug h educ ation for all of he alth care must be acco mplished. Use of the Iowa Co m- munications Network (ICN) fiber optic interac- tive statewide video s ystem is being used, but will be used to an even gre ater extent in the fu- ture. The Diabetes Prevent ion and Control Pro- gram and the Iowa Diabetes Network provide quarterly progra ms that ad dress the required components o f a certified program . Partnership support to dev elop an on going endorsem ent program for health care providers continues. Programs prese nted by respe cted educators and practitioners in diabetes can be made availabl e in many areas that are dis tant from the originating ICN site. The interactive format allows for questions to be answered. Also, 2-hour program s make attendance m ore convenient for practitioners who would not have to leave their practice for a long period. A suc- cessful effort between the Iowa Medical Society and the Iowa Department of Public Health was well received. Indicators of quality health care that are measurable through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sy stem (BRF SS), Health Plan Em - ployer Data and Inform ation Set (HEDIS), and by peer review provide a measure of the level of care. He alth care professio nals who provide secondary prevention are aware of the needs of their patients and are being proactive. HEDIS is considered one of the m ost reliable measures for com paring health care quality and is used by more than 90% of A merica's health pla ns to evaluate clinical quality and custom er service rather than sim ply price. Seven commercial insurance plans in Iowa report HEDIS 2 004 dia- betes measures (based on 2003 services). Iowa exceeds the other m easured groups in all categories (except HbA 1c control where lower is better). Im provements were made in every area except ey e exams, where the data shows a slight decreas e. HbA1c measures persons with diabetes who have received at least one A1c test annually . The A1c test measures a p erson' s blood sugar over tim e. Th e eye exam category measures per- sons with diabetes who have had annual eye ex- ams. The lipid control categor y measures per- sons with diabetes who have received lipid screening in the last y ear. The followin g two graphs compare 2003 and 2004 Iowa HEDIS data with the west no rth cen- tral region an d the nation .

By 2010, increase fro m 74% to 75% the proporti on that has at least one annual c ompre- hensive foot examination (Behavioral Risk Fac- tor Surveillance Sy stem , 2003). By 2010, increase fro m about 90% to 95% the prop ortio n that has a gl ycosylated hemoglo- bin m easurement at lea st once a y ear (Behav- ioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sy stem , 2003). By 2008, incr ease to 75% t he proport ion that has adequatel y controlled their blood pressure under 13 0/80. By 2008, increase to at le ast 85% the pro- portion that annuall y obtai ns lipid assessm ent (i.e., total cholesterol, low density lipopr otein cholesterol, high densit y lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride). By 2008, incr ease to 40% t he proport ion that has at least o ne annual uri nary measurement of microalbu min. By 2008, incr ease to 55% t he proport ion over aged 40 that regularl y take aspirin.

People with diabetes have mortality rates, especially from cardiovasc ular disease, t wo to four tim es greater than non-diabetic people. Other contributing factors may include end-stage renal diseas e (ESRD), diabetic acidosis, and in- fection. Studies indicate that debilitating condi- tions in peopl e with diabetes can be prevented and certainly delay ed with secondary and terti- ary prevention. 33.3 Action Step Throug h 2010, prom ote a team approach to comprehensi ve diabetes c are that encourages collaboration by doctors, nurses, dietitians, pharmacists, podiatrists, o ptometrists, and dental care professio nals, as well as others not tradi- tionally considered in this arena.

Iowa has op portunit ies for organ donation with driver's licen se renewal. There are three tran splant progra ms in Iowa. End- stage renal diseas e (ESRD) has been increasing in prevalence from 1,183 cases in 1992 t o 1,404 in 1996. The percentage of those cases with diabetes as a primary diagnosis increase d from 27% to 36% . A total of 11 2 kid ney or kidney and/or pancreas transplants were done at two of the three Iowa facilities. Of those, 35, or just over 31% , were for persons with diabetes. The end-stage renal diseas e grant was discontinued in Iowa, elim inating the source of data. The Diabetes Pr evention and Control Progra m epi- demiologist will pursue additional sources. Increasing aw arenes s of diabetes and wa ys to prevent and m anage it, and early treatment for it, will decrease its devastat ing effects and result in an im proved qualit y of li fe. According to the Journal of the American Podiatric M edical As- sociation , 1994, 1 5% of with di abetes will likely de velop foot ulc ers. The annual inci-dence of lower extrem ity amputation ranges from 37 to 13 7 per 10, 000 people with d iabetes, a rate 15 to 4 0 times higher than that of non- diabetic peop le. Diabetic retin opathy is a common co mplica- tion of diabetes that affect s the tiny blood ves- sels of the ret ina, which can break down, leak or beco me blocked, affecting and im pairing vision over tim e. In some people with diabetic reti- nopath y, serious dam age to the e ye can occur when abnormal new blood vessels grow on the surface of the retina. Diabetic retinopathy can affect almost anyone with diabetes. The Centers for Diseas e Control and Prevention (CDC) esti- mate that 10.3 m illion Americans have diag- nosed diabetes, while an additional 5.4 million have diabetes that has not been diagnos ed. In general, the longer som eone has diabetes, the greater the risk of develo ping diabetic retinopa- thy. Eventual ly, alm ost everyone with ju venile onset diabetes will develop som e signs of the condition. T hose who acquire diabetes later in life are also a t risk, though somewhat le ss so. Diabetes also increase s the risk of other ey e disease s such as catar act and glaucom a. Be- April 2005 Chap ter 3 - Page 13 of 1 6 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Diabetes cause of its dangers to goo d vision, people with diabetes are u rged to seek annual dilated eye exams. Re search suggests that the risk of dia- betic retinopath y can be reduced throu gh careful control of blood sugar. Pe ople with dia betes are also encouraged to cont rol their blood pressure (Vision Problems in the U.S . by National E ye Institute to Pr event Blindne ss America). Organ donati on is vitall y important to those with diabetes since succ essful kidne y and/or pancreas tran splantation can extend and greatly improve quali ty of life. I owans can sig n up for organ do natio n when the y seek driver's li cense renewal, whi ch also provides an effecti c that reaches a broad spec- trum of the populatio n. Each y ear, as many as 25,000 people lose their sight to diabetic ey e diseas e, a leadi ng cause of blindness in the United States . The m a- jor cause in persons with diabetes is dia betic retinopathy . Detecting and treating it with laser therapy can reduce the development of severe vision loss by an esti mated 50% to 60%, accord- ing to the CDC. An annual dilated ey e exam can identif y diabe sy mptoms are appa rent. Comprehensi ve foot care can reduce a mpu- tation rates by 45% to 85%, according to the CDC. Working together, people with diabetes and their health care providers can reduc e the occurrence of this com plication by contr olling the levels of blood gluc ose, blood pressure and blood lipids, as well a s other preventive care such as regular co mprehen sive foot exams. 34.1 Action Step By 2010, dec rease to 480 the num ber of deaths in persons with diabetes a s the primary cause (fro m 729 in 2002).

Living wit h a disabil- ity is uni que. It cannot be fully understood until it is experienced. Disability is a natural part of the hum an ex perience that does not dim inish the disabled person 's right t o the oppor tunity of liv- ing in an d contributi ng to the mainstream of American soc iety. Disability encompasses a wide range of ex- periences. It c an begin any time during one' s life, at conception , durin childhoo d or adulthoo d, or as the result of aging. It may affect one or m ore areas - mobility, per- sonal care, co mmunication, or learning. It can be hidden, as with d yslexia, or ob vious, as with a spinal cord injury or Down sy ndrom e. It m ay be m ild or severe, or it m ay be pro gressive, chronic or int ermittent, as i n the beginni ng stages of multiple sclerosis . A disability i s rarely static. Instead, it will likely fluctuate during the course of life. The same disability m ay manifest itself differently in different people, as is often the case wit h cere- bral palsy . It may result from genetic abnor- malities, trau ma, illness, chem ical i mbalances, or conditions usually associated with aging. Some disabilities can be prevented, othe rs can- not. Disabilities are of many different ty pes: physical, cognitive, ps ychiatric, behavioral, or sensory . Ho wever, it is not the t ype of \"diagno- sis\" that makes a condition a disabilit y. People with disabiliti es do not need to have t heir dis- abilit y removed or fixed to be whole and con- tributing m embers of soci ety. Often, whether or not a person with a disability participates in and contributes to society is deter mined by the indi- vidual' s access to society 's goods and services, and the availabilit y of individualized, \"consumer controlled\" services and supports. For a person with a disability, services and supports must in- clude health prom otion, pr imary and sp ecialized health care, tr ansportation, assistive technology (devices whic h help the disabled person to func- tion), persona l assistanc e, and peer support. For far too long, society has considered the concepts of good health and disabilit y to be con- tradictory. In fact, good health has been consid- ered to be synony mous with the absence of dis- ability and assu med to be bey ond the reach of people with disabilities. Such assu mptions are not necessaril y true. Most people with disabili- ties have the potential to le ad healthy and pro- ductive lives if given the opportu nity to attain good health and full y parti cipate in society . Attaining and maintaining good health f or people with disabilities, like all people, is a process that m ust focus on m aximizing function- ing and well- being thr oughout the lifesp an. Be- cause the nat ure of the process that le ads to good health is interactive and involves consid erations other than bi ology, preventi on m ust deal with traditional he alth issues as well as the so cial, educational, spiritual, and e nvironm ental factors that ultim ately help to determ ine quality of life. Health prom otion for peopl e with disabili- ties includes: Prom otion healthy lifesty les and a he althy environm ent; Prevention of health com plications and fur- ther disabling conditions; Preparation of the person with a disability and his or her family to understand and monitor personal health and health c are needs; an d Prom otion of opport unities for participation in comm only held life activities. April 2005 Chap ter 4 - Page 1 of 28 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Re vision Disab ilities People with disabilities particularly need qualit y health prom otion and rehabilitati ve ser- vices, as well as long-term services and sup- ports. Having a disabilit y is not an immuniza- tion against d eveloping t he same chronic condi- tions as the rest of the po pulation. Peopl e with disabilities ar e susceptible to the sam e health conditions and, in som e cases, may be a t in- creas ed risk. The Healthy People 201 0 chapter on disabilit y and secondary conditi ons notes that when co mpared to people without disabilities, those with dis abilities have higher rates of chronic condi tions, inclu ding diabetes, d epres- sion and sadness, elevat ed blood pressure and blood cholesterol, obesit y, tooth l oss, and vision and hearing i mpairments. They also have lower rates of reco mmended health behaviors (e.g., cardiovascula r, strengthening and flexibility ac- tivities, and abstention fro m cigarette smoking). A num ber of studies have also shown th at peo- ple with a traumatic brain injur y have hi gher than average rates of substance abuse. Prevention is important for people with d is- abilities as fo r every one else and includes self- care, counseli ng, screening for early detection, appropriate and tim ely treatm ent, and early rec- ogniti on and reduction of known risks. Many of the health pro motion strategies developed to re- duce the risk of illness in the general population can be used directly with people with di sabili- ties. In some case s, however, new strate gies need to be de veloped or ad apted for peo ple with disabilities and tested in inc lusive, communit y- based settings. People with disabilities also are at risk of developing certain secondary conditions (i.e., conditions dir ectly related to their prim ary dis- abilit y) that may add to their level of di sability and negativel y affect their independence and quality of life. These conditions m ay include chronic pain, drug i nteractions, contractures, skin breakdo wn, injuries, co mmunicati on difficulties or de- pression-relat ed conditions due to t heir isolation in society . One Iowa-speci fic study , the \"Uni- versity of College Public Health tion Secon dary Conditions Mobilit y Impairments,\" found highe r than usual rates of drug i nteractions am ong adults and elders with mobilit y impairments. That same study noted significant rates of depression in adults with mobilit y impairments. In addition, many people with disabiliti es, particularl y those with m obility im pairments, report the y experi- ence one or m ore conditions generally associ- ated with aging (e.g., pain, fatigue, loss of func- tion, and loss of independe nce) beginnin g as early as their twenties. Although more research is needed to un der- stand the incidence, cause and prevention of cer- tain secondary conditi ons, a num ber of studies have identified specific secondar y conditions that are preventable or m anageable. One study of 40 comm on secondary conditi ons in people with m obility im pairments reported that partici- pants had an average of 13 secondary conditions during the pr evious year. This stud y also foun d that 11 of the 15 cond itions with the hig hest in- cidence and severity involved environm ental, behavioral and ps ychosoci al factors that could be prevented. Disparity problem s resulti ng from disabilit y are co mplex and uni que. As with other groups that historically have been disadvantaged, peo- ple with disabilities have higher rates of unem - ployment, lower inco mes, less educatio nal op- portunit ies, fewer living op tions, and an ongoi ng struggle for i nclusion. Alt houg h the A mericans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which became law in 1990, was created to address many of the bar- riers to participation in society , full implem enta- tion has not yet been realiz ed. People with disabilities also encounter s ig- nificant structural, financial and personal barri- ers that li mit their acce ss to health and he alth- related car e. Those who are elderly or m embers of minority groups face additional barri ers. Our health care sy stem does not foster the inclusion, integration an d indepen dence of people with disabilities. Instead, services are often frag- mented, frequently inadequ ate in addressing the constellation of needs of people with di sabilities, and m any times inacc essibl e. Major concerns for people with disabiliti es include structural barriers s uch as the lac k of availability of services and accessible buildings, transportation and pro grams. A num ber of ser- vices needed by people with disabilities (e.g., specialty medical care, rehabilitation, l ong-term services, and supports) are not universally avail- Chap ter 4 - Page 2 of 28 April 2005 Disabilities HI 2010 - Mi d-Course Revision able and are particularly lacking in rural areas. Other service s may be available but physically inaccessible. For exam ple, women with disabili- ties are concerned about t he high incide nce of false negative mammograms due to equi pment that is not properly adapted or technicians who do not know how to pr operly position w omen with disabiliti es. Data show that wo men wit h severe phy sical disabilities ar e significantly less likely to receive regular pelvic exam inations. And o ne stud y found that ph ysically disab led women are at the same risk for phy sical and sexual abuse as able- bodied wom en, but experience abuse over longer periods because they lack acces s to resources to help them escape abusive environm ents. Personal barriers, including attitudes, knowledge an d comm unication, also infl uence access to car e for people with disabilities. Con- sumers with disabilities report that m any health care providers focus on the disabilities and fail to deal with critical pri mary care. They also in- dicate that they lack im portant inform ation about maintaining t heir health and m anaging their dis- abilit y, which is vital to hel ping them attain and maintain their health and independence. There are numerous co mplaints that health education m aterials ar e not available in acces si- ble formats and that health provi ders lack the knowledge an d tim e to co mmunicate in an effec- tive manner. Co mmunication with peo ple with disabilities may involve adapting the content or print size of written materials, using int erpreters, recording instructions, or w orking with special communicati on devices. People with disabilities also face a nu mber of financial barriers to ac cess services. Obtain- ing adequate private insurance can be particu- larly difficult due to restrictions on pre-existing conditions, caps on the am ount or cost of ser- vices, benefit packages that do not cover needed services, and the affordability of the package. Affordabilit y is a particularly im portant is- sue in a rural state like Iow a where significant numbers of people with di sabilities work for small employers who do n ot pay for health care benefits. As a result, many people with disabili- ties are forced to forego working or lim it them - selves to part-tim e em ployment in order to m ain-tain governm ent health insurance becau se they cannot obtain adequate coverage through their employers or cannot afford to bu y it. According to the 2000 Census, 49.7 m illion Americans have some ty pe of lon g lastin g condi- tion or disability. The y represented 19.3% of U.S. citizens aged 5 and older in the civilian non-instit utionalized popul ation - or nearly one person in five . People were defined as having a disabil ity if they m et one or more of the following: They were aged 5 or o lder and had a sen- sory, phy sical, mental, or self-care disabilit y;. They were aged 16 or older and indicated they had a dis ability affecting going outside the home; or They were aged 16 to 74 a nd indicated they had an em ployment disability. Those in the 2000 Census who were found to have a disabilit y include d: 9.3 m illion (3.6%) with a sensory (sight or hearing) disabilit y; 21.2 m illion ( 8.2%) with a condition limit- ing basic physical a ctivities, such as wal king, climbing stairs, lifting, or carry ing; 12.4 m illion ( 4.8%) with a condition causing difficult y in learning or remem bering; 6.8 m illion (2.6%) with a conditi on causing difficult y in dressing, bathing or getting around inside the house; and 21.3 m illion aged 16 to 64 (11.9%) with a condition that affected their abilit y to work at a job or a business. Over 46% of those reporting a disabilit y re- ported m ore than one disabilit y. A disability affects not onl y the person with the disabilit y but the person's fam ily. Studies show that about 80% of primary helpers are rela- tives and nearly half of t hem live with the person with the disabilit y. Over 30% of American families have a member limited in a life activity. Without adeq uate support, providi ng care for a person with a disabilit y can result in significant stress and affect the health of the fam ily mem- ber(s) providi ng the care. The effects of disabilit y in Iowa are only now beginn ing to be under stood. Alth ough a comprehensive, coordinat ed state data sy stem April 2005 Chap ter 4 - Page 3 of 28 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Re vision Disab ilities does not yet exist, available data provide a pic- ture of the scope and infl uence of disabilit y for Iowa' s citizens. For instance, over 10% of the state' s school-age children routinel y receive spe- cial education or related ser vices due to some type of disabl ing condition. Some data ab out the effects of disabilit y on the adult Iow a populatio n are beco ming known. In 2003, about 375, 000 non-institutionali zed adults (17.1% of the design ated populati on) re- ported having activity lim itations, according to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sy stem . About 3 4,000 of those surv eyed in 2002 re- ported the y needed assi stance with personal care, and 88,500 reported needing help with rou- tine tasks suc h as household chores, shopping or getting arou nd. There has bee n significant growth in the rate of disabilit y in America in the last quarter of the 20th century. The percent of the pop ulation with at least one a ctivity limitation grew from 11.7% in 19 70 to 16%18% in 1994. T his gro wth is attributed to a gradual lo ng-term increase due to the aging of the popu lation and a short-t erm in- crease in you nger pop ulations. The long-ter m increase is expected to con- tinue, if not acceler ate, in the com ing de cades. The percent of the total population aged 65 and older is proje cted to increase fro m 12% to 20% in the next 30 years. This means that ev en if the rate of disability in t he olde r age group re mains constant, the actual num ber of people wi th dis- abilit y will increase substantiall y. This trend supports the need for a pu blic health approach to prevention an d participatio n. Before 1990, disabilit y rates for children and youn ger adult s held steady for nearly two dec- ades. Since 1990, however, dramatic ch anges have been not ed in the rate of disabilit y for both groups. Bet ween 1990 and 1994, t he disability rate increased by 16% among adults age d 18 to 44, and by 40% for bo ys and 33% for gir ls under aged 18. Sim ilar increas es have been noted in recent studies of work disa bility and personal assist ance needs in the same age groups. Al- though specul ation is rife, the reasons behind these increa ses are not y et fully understood. Among adult s aged 18 to 44, increases are noted in the rates of orthop edic im pairments and mental and nervous disord ers. In childr en under aged 18, rate changes may be partl y due to re- cent i mprovements in heal th care. As a result of improved health care, so me 95% of child ren with disabiliti es and severe chronic health condi- tions now reach adultho od. National data found increase s in the prevalence of severe ast hma, mental disorders (including attention defi cit dis- order), m ental retardation, and learning disabili- ties in children. Because about 70% of t he populati on is under aged 45, these increases are responsible for the recent rise in the proportion of the populat ion with disabilities. The likelihood of havi ng a disabilit y in- creas es with age. In Iowa, the elderly experi- ence disability at roughl y twice the rate of those in the ol der working ages (45 to 64) an d three times the rate of the youn ger working ag e group (18 to 44). A still sm aller fraction of chi ldren have disabilities. Percent of Iowans with Disabilities by wa Department of P ublic Health. According to the 1994 National Health In- terview Survey on Disabilit y, nearl y two- thirds of the po pulat ion with fu nctional disabili ties and half of those with long-ter m care needs were under aged 65. These num bers, taken with the length of t ime y ounger people will live with their disabilit y, shows the i mportance of includ- ing the younger populations with disabilities in public health polic y and program planning. Although age appears to be the main factor in the likelihood of a disabilit y, som e differences by self-identified race and ethnicity remain. Na- tionall y, the rate of disability reported by people in different ethnic gro ups v aried fro m a low of 16.6% for Asians and 19% for Pacific Islanders to a high of 24.3% for both African-Americans Chap ter 4 - Page 4 of 28 April 2005 Disabilities HI 2010 - Mi d-Course Revision and Native Americ ans. The rate for His panics was 20.9% and for whites 1 8.3%. The only way to elim inate years of dispa rity for people wi th disabilities is to recogni ze them as full participants in di verse, tolerant and inclu- sive co mmunities. Inclusion was used as a guid- ing pri nciple in developi ng its approach and de- termined that, whenever possible, the health prom otion and preventive service needs of peo- ple with disabilities shoul d be addressed within each individual chapter of Healthy Iowans 201 0. Thus, the team developed and distribute d a white paper on crosscutting access issues and a set of guidin g principles fo r serving peo ple with disabilities to other chapter team s, which is pre- sented at the end of this i ntroduction . This is suppo rted b y the Ju ne 1999 U.S. Su- prem e Court Olm stead decision that hel d dis- crimination on the basis of disabilit y as illegal. The decision stated that people with dis abilities have the right to services provided in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. In February 2003, Governor Tom Vilsack signed Executive Order 27 ur ging Iowa to \"m ove pur- posefull y to swiftly implement the Ol mstead decision\" and coordinate a co mprehensive effort by state agencies to \"resha pe the structure and nature of comm unity -based services.\" Covered in this chapter 's action plan are broad prevent ion questions about peo ple with disabilities, including thos e about infrastructure and prom otion of opport unities for participation in comm on life activities. Many of the goals and action steps reflect the goals of Executive Order 27. Wi thin this framework, the committee has organized the action pl an into five s ections: health care information and em powerment; health, wellness and disability ; professional training; parti cipation in so ciety ; and individual and comm unity-based services and supports. Iowans with disabilities will still face much dis- parity even if all the plan' s goals are met. People with disabilities must be recognized as people first. The y share hopes and drea ms and have the same expecta tions as all members of society . They expect to: Attain economic self-sufficiency , live i nde- pendentl y, enjoy good health, and f ully partici- pate in all aspects of life; Live, work, recre ate and learn in the com- munities of their choice; and Be active, valued and contr ibutin g members of their comm unities and society . People with disabilities req uire the infor ma- tion and respect nece ssary to m ake their own decisions. Th ey must be equal partners in con- ceptualizing, developing , directing, and evaluat- ing policies, program s and services. Traditional health service s and s ystems must be adapted to foster the inclusion and i ndepend- ence of peopl e with disabilities. Specifically , services and system s must: Provide inf ormation and training to help people with disabilities make their own health care deci sions and choose their own health care plans and providers; Emphasize pr evention and wellness to pro- mote independence and personal responsibilit y; Address chronic health conditions and en- hanced functioning; Provide both acute and episodic care; Allow the appropriate use of specialty and rehabilitative care; Facilitate tran sportation and provide physi- cal ac cess to buildings, progra ms and ser vices; and Prom ote coordination an d continuit y of care between healt h care providers and health and human se rvice systems. Public and private sector health care fin anc- ing m ust assure equity in access to health care, prom ote the development of a sea mles s system of care, and develop polici es that are responsive to the needs o f diverse pop ulations, incl uding people with Elim inate discri mination on the itions; Support a con sumer-driven, risk-neutral sy cove rs every one; Provide broa d-based benefits that adequately meet individual needs; Provide acces s to affordable health care; and Elim inate disincentives for people to pursue employment and econom ic self-sufficien cy be- cause of their inabilit y to obtain health coverage. April 2005 Chap ter 4 - Page 5 of 28 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Re vision Disab ilities Prevention efforts for people with disabili- ties need to address not only traditional health issues but als o the social, educational, spiritual, and environm ental factors that maxim ize func- tioning and i ndependence, and ultim ately deter- mine quality of life. Long-term services and supports for people with di sabilities must: Prom ote the use of indivi dual and in-h ome services as the first option and out-of-home place ment as the last resort ; Be individual ly designed t o meet the needs of the indi vidual and the family in which he or she lives; Be provided in inclusive, c ommunity -based settings; and Be coordinated thro ugh ser vice teams that are directed by people with disabilities and their families who have choice and flexibilit y in the services and supports t hey receive. Health prom otion m ust include assurance of access to plac es, buildings and services f or peo- ple with disabilities to part icipate in commonly held activities, includi ng Progress A num ber of products were developed and objectives achieved since the disabilit y plan was unveiled in 2000. Guideli nes were created for health care professionals w ho comm unicate with Iowans with disabilities. A \"Consu mer Report Card\" provided com pariso ns between H Managem \"Living W ell\" g Live Well with a Disabi lity\" health pr omotion program s were conducted around the state. An adolescent ve rsion of the \" Living Well\" program was developed and is bein g piloted i n several community schools. A state arthritis program was e stablished. Training to make servi ces physically accessible was conducted. Also, workshops on \"fair h ousing laws\" were held an d objectives o n reducing barriers to employment achieved. Several goals on enhanc- ing transporta tion for I owans with disabi tive technolo gy were held. Finall y, Iowa held its first conference on disability and health in No- vember 2003. The \"Iowa Summit on Disabilit y and Health: A Call to Act ion\" addresse d health disparities, program strateg ies, and inclusion of people with disabilities in health prom otion, ac- cess to health care, substan ce abuse, and in- jury/violence prevention. Several goals were not achieved, prim arily because of limited resourc es. The plan to visit all state offic es to asse ss physical barrie rs was not possible because of la ck of available staff. However, an Am ericans wi th Disabilities Act (ADA) co mpliance survey is available fr ee-of- charge upon r equest. The full-tim e state ADA coordinator position was eli minated beca use of fundin g cuts; therefore, ADA co mpliance infor- mation is no w provided by staff from the Com - mission on P ersons with Disabilities. The pro- posal to establish a statewi de, consum er- controlled personal assistan ce servic e was not funded d ue to budget shortf alls. Many of the objectives and action steps con- tained in the updated version of t his chapter rep- resent a continuation of objectives that have been attained. Updated data were used throug h- out the document. New is sues, such as the Olmstead decision, will ha ve a profound affect on service delivery and are also incorporated into the revis ed docum ent.

With the advent of electronic inform ation processing, the am ount of i nform ation on health care and disabilities in all f ormats has in creased greatly . However, there is no integrated or read- ily acces sible, com prehens ive sy stem of infor- mation dissemination in I owa. Designing an infrastructure that enhances the availability and accessibility of health care inform ation for peo- ple with disabilities and their support pe rsons will greatly facilitate their participation i n health care deci sions. 41.1 Action Step Throug h 2010, prov ide dis abil- ity-related m aterials to a minimum of 25 service providers ann ually. (An Io wa Department of Public Health action step.) 41.2 Action Step During 2005, identify funding resources and develop a web site for coor dination an d dissem i- nation of spe cific disability health care and re- lated inform ation with li nks to web sites on edu- cation, service provision, f unding resour ces, technology, support groups or persons, disabili- ties res earch, speakers, cha t room s and other appropriate sites. (An Iowa Department of Pub- lic Health act ion step.) 41.3 Action Step During 2005, identif y funding sources and develop a pilot project to teach people with dis- abilities and others to evaluate printed and elec- tronic health care and related inform ation and to use this information in health care decisi on- making. (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health, Center for Disabilities and Develop ment, and Child Health Specialty Clinics action step.) 42 Goal S tatement Develop and distribute a comparison of health care plans and initiate a curricu- lum that helps people w ith disabil ities select the best health insurance plan. Baselin e: See Ration ale. Rationale Managed care has brought a proliferation of health care plans and a corresponding need for persons with disabilities and their suppor t per- sons to beco me discriminating consumers. Ma- terial describi ng such plans is often difficult to interpret and may not readi ly conve y to people with chronic health care ne eds what is c overed by the plan and often does not pr ovide opportu- nities for con sumer input. The development of guide lines for the pres- entation of pl an inform ation to persons with dis- abilities would greatl y enhance their abilit y to participate as inform ed con sumers. Educational opport unities encouraging t he developm ent of self-advocacy and negotiating skills are also im - portant to co nsumer participation. 42.1 Action Step In 200 6, identify fund ing to develop and pilot a curriculum that tea ches people with dis- abilities how to choose thei r health care team mem bers, plan visits with providers, u nderstand their rights as consum ers, and nego tiate with providers and payers. (An Iowa Department of Public Health, Center for Disabilities and De- velopm ent, and Child Health Specialty Clinics action step.) 43 Goal S tatement In compliance with the Olmstead deci- sion, assure that each Healthy Iowans 2010 chapter assesses the health issues and potential treatment available for people with disabilities and incorporates appropriate goals and action steps in each chapter's action plan to help elimi- nate health disparities for the disabled. Baselin e: See Ration ale. Rationale People with disabilities are susceptible to the same chronic health conditions as the general populati on an d som etimes are at increased risk. They are also at risk for secondar y conditions that can increase their disability and decrease their quality of life.

Rationale The Iowa Departm ent of Public Health, Pre- vention of Disabilities Policy Council, a nd Uni-versity of Io wa are condu cting a statewide sur- vey to ident ify the secondary conditions and risk factors of Iowans with mobilit y impairments. However, the se survey s are ti me-limited. The state needs an ongoing data sy stem to tra ck changes in secondar y conditions and ris k factors. Such a sy stem will identify im portant trends and aid in the eva luation of potential treatments. 44.1 Action Step Throug h 2006, anal yze and dissem ained from the longitu dinal stud y of secondary conditions in people with mobility impairments. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health, University of Iowa College of P ublic Health, and Prevention of Disabilities P olicy Council action step.) 44.2 Action Step Beginning i n 2005 , identif y questions t o be added to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveil- lance Sy stem that identify and describe health disparities, secondar y conditions, and participa- tion for peopl e with disabilities, and initi ate a request for funding data collection and analy sis through the state' s Centers of Diseas e Control and Prevention Disabilities and Health grant. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health and Pre- vention of Disabilities Policy Council action step.) 44.3 Action Step Through 2010, collect and analy ze data from the questions added to the Behavioral Risk Fac- tor Surveillance Sy stem and, in 2006, di ssemi- nate the infor mation to inte rested disability groups and state and local polic y makers, health planners, and service providers. (An Iowa De- partment of Public Health, University of Iowa College of Public Health, and Prevention of Dis- abilities Policy Council action step.) 45 Goal S tatement Test at least three health promotion pro- grams designed for people with di sabili- ties.

Chap ter 4 - Page 8 of 28 April 2005 Disabilities HI 2010 - Mi d-Course Revision Rationale With funding from the Cen ters for Dise ase Control and Prevention (CDC), Iowa ca n select and study potential progra ms to increas e the proporti on of people with disabilities wh o en- gage in appropriate health care practi ces. Grant participants will design the studies, which will address needs as identified through the s econ- dary conditions survey and other data sources discussed earl ier. 45.1 Action Step During 20 05, conduct a stu dy of the selected program s, including Livin g Well with a Disabil- ity and Conti nuing to Li ve Well with a Disabil- ity, and evaluate the results . (An Iowa Depart- ment of Publi c Health, University of Io wa Health Care Center for Disabilities and Devel- opment, and Prevention of Disabilities Policy Council action step.) 45.2 Action Step By 2007, desi gn and pilot a health prom o- tion curriculum for older a dolescents wi th dis- abilities who are transitioning int o adult hood. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health, Univer- sity of Iowa Health Care Center for Disabilities and Development, and Prevention of Disabilities Policy Counc il action step.) 45.3 Action Step Throug h 2010, review and design additi onal health prom otion pr ogram s for testing. ( An Iowa Department of Publi c Health, Prevention of Disabilities Policy Council, Center for Dis- abilities, and Develop ment and Blue Ribbon Panel on Secondar y Con ditions action st ep.) 46 Goal S tatement Establish a netw ork of at least 10 com- munity -based ph ysical activity resource centers around the state for use by peo- ple with dis abilities. Baseli ne: See Ration - ale. Rationale People with disabilities, their fam ilies, an d their health and h uman service provider s need access to infor mation and resources to help them understand th eir ph ysical activit y needs and adapted, indi vidualized ph ysical activit y pro- gram s. Such knowledge and resources ar e not readily availa ble throu gh conventio nal commu- nity health sources. A network of resource cen- ters that recei ve regular information and training from the Iowa Department of Public He alth's Disability and Health program will help meet this need. 46.1 Action Step During 20 05, conduct a series of focus groups with people with di sabilities, their fam i- lies, and their provi ders to determ ine the t ype of inform ation a nd resources that are neede d and would be use d. (An Iowa Department of Public Health action step.) 46.2 Action Step During 20 06, contact Iowa Centers for Inde- pendent Living and othe r community services to solicit their support and de sign a communit y- based resourc e. (An Iowa Depart ment of Public Health action step.) 46.3 Action Step During 20 07, begin establishing comm unity- based phy sical activity resource centers and pro- vide training as needed. (An Iowa Dep artment of Public Health action step.) 47 Goal S tatement Identify new fund ing a nd develop col- laborative applications that w ill expand health promotion and prevention for Io- wans with disabilities. Baseli ne: See Ra - tionale. Rationale Rese arch is i dentify ing effective health prom otion and preventio n for people wi th dis- abilities. As this data becomes available, federal and private funding sources are responding by April 2005 Chap ter 4 - Page 9 of 28 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Re vision Disab ilities initiating new disabilit y prevention effort s. Some of them deal with prevention thr ough such methods as personal care, communication or mobility . Others address disability prevention by gender or diagnostic categories, as is the case with the new federally funded arthritis initiative discussed in goal 4 8. Iowa needs a way to track resear ch, identify new funding , and respond t o requests for pro- posals quickl y. Locating f unding will be critical to expandi ng state health prom otion and preven- tion to all dis ability groups . 47.1 Action Step During 20 05, identif y and respond to f und- ing o pport unities for collaborative prevention of disabilit y and health prom otion for persons with disabilities. (An Iowa Dep artment of Public Health and Prevention of D isabilities Policy Council action step.) 47.2 Action Step Through 2010, obtain resources to i mple- ment the reco mmended col laborative prevention of disabilit y and health pr omotion activities of this and ot her Healthy Iowans 20 10 chapters. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health and Pre- vention of Disabilities Policy Council action step.) 47.3 Action Step During 20 05, ensure that mid-course revi- sions of Healthy Iowans 2 010 chapters consider and/or include appropriate disabilit y-related goals, activities and/or data collection. ( An Iowa Department of Publi c Health and Disabil- ity Chapter Task Force acti on step.) 48 Goal S tatement Maintain and expand the Io wa arthritis program to include surveillance, p ublic awareness, health care provider and consumer education, and programs to decrease disability and improve quality of life. Base line: See Rationale. Rationale An estim ated 585, 000 ad ult Iowans (26.6 %) have been diagnosed with a rthritis by a doctor - 352,000 wom en and 23 3,000 m en. An addi- tional 38 4,000 adult Iowan s (17.5% ), 170,000 women and 214,0 00 m en, have chronic joint symptoms (possible arthritis) but do not have doctor-diagnosed arthritis. Arthritis is a leading cause of disabilit y in Iowa. (2003 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sy stem .) The Iowa art hritis progra m was establi shed in 1999 and t he Iowa Arthritis Task Force was convened in 2000. The Iowa Arthritis Action Plan was issu ed in 2001. The program and plan provide surve illance, healt h care provider and consumer information and resources, a warenes s of arthritis, and expans ion of existing evidence- based self- manage ment. Strategies such as weight control, phy sical activity and self- management education he lp Iowans with doctor- diagnosed arthritis and chr onic joint symptoms (possible arthritis) manage their conditions. These strat egies need state wide implementation. Maintaining a nd expanding the Iowa Arthri- tis Program within the Io wa Department of Pu b- lic Health will bring t ogeth er the resources of various pub lic, private and volu ntary stake- holders to reduce the i mpact of arthritis and im - prove the q uality of life of Iowans affected b y it. 48.1 Action Step Throug h 2010, by July 1st of each y ear, an- nuall y secure funding to m aintain and expand the Iowa arthritis program . (An Iowa Depart- ment of Publi c Health actio n step.) 48.2 Action Step By Dece mber 2005, update the Iowa arthri- tis action plan. (An Iowa Department of Public Health and Iowa Arthritis Task Force action step.) 48.3 Action Step Throug h 2010, convene th e Iowa Arthritis Task Force a minimum of two times ann ually to provide guida nce to the Iowa arthritis program and to assist in arthritis program s in the Iowa arthritis action plan. (An I owa Depart ment of Chap ter 4 - Page 10 of 2 8 April 2005 Disabilities HI 2010 - Mi d-Course Revision Public Health and Iowa Arthritis Task Force action step.) 49 Goal S tatement Plan and conduct four arthritis self-help course leader w orksho ps annuall such as the arthritis self-help course, has proven to reduce arthritis pain and health care co sts. Nationally , these progra ms are esti mated to reach a small proporti on of people with arthritis. The arthritis self-help course is available across Iowa, but expansion is lim ited by the lac k of trained leader s and resources to deliver the course. Availability of self- management courses in rural count ies is particularly important be- cause they lack health care providers and re- sources. The needs of an increasingly aging populati on al so contribute to the challenge. The arthritis self-help course should be available in all area s of the state. 49.1 Action Step Throug h 2010, identif y loc ations statewide for arthritis self-help course leader traini ng and prom ote to targeted groups (e.g., local p ublic health, AARP, parish nurs es, hospitals) and in- dividuals in February and August each y ear. (An Iowa Depart ment of Public Health, Arthritis Foundation I owa Chapter, and Iowa Arthritis Task Force a ction step.) 49.2 Action Step Throug h 2010, plan an d conduct two s pring and two fall arthritis self-help course leader training workshops in Ma y and October each year. (An Io wa Department of Pu blic Health and Arthritis Foundation I owa Chapter action step.) 49.3 Action Step Throug h 2010, provide o ngoing technical assist ance thr ough a variety of m ethods, training resources, an d materials to arthritis self- help course leaders throug hout the year. (An Iowa Department of Public Health and Arthriti s Foundatio n Iowa Chapter action step.) 49.4 Action Step Through 2010, assess the effectivenes s of the arthritis self-help course leader traini ng in July and ea ch year. (An Iowa De- partm ent of Public Health and Arthritis Founda- tion Iowa Chapter action step.) 49.5 Action Step Throug h 2010, by Decem ber 31st of each year, collect and evaluate surve y data from ar- thritis self-help course participants and the Be- havioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sy stem . (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health actio n step.) 410 Goal Statement Plan and conduct at least three arthritis presentations annuall y for providers w ho deliver direct care to people with arthri- tis. Baseli ne: See Rationale. Rationale Many advances in the manage ment of ar thri- tis have occurred in recent y ears. Iowa health care providers need acc ess to current informa- tion o n the tre atment and managem ent of arthri- tis and up-to- date health communications and assistive technology resour ces. 410.1 Action Step Through 2010, by April 30th of each y ear, identify audie nces and eve nts for the pre senta- tion of arthritis inform ation and resources. (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health and Iowa Ar- thritis Task Force action step.) 410.2 Action Step Throug h 2010, by November 15th of each year, plan and conduct presentations and provide resources. (A n Iowa Depar tment of Public Health action step.) 410.3 Action Step Throug h 2010, by Decem ber 31st of each year, collect evaluations and evaluate the effec- April 2005 Chap ter 4 - Page 11 of 2 8 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Re vision Disab ilities tiveness of presentations. (An Iowa Dep artment of Public Health action step.) 411 Goal Statement Collect and anal yze data every odd year through 2009 and report on the impact of arthritis in Iow a every even year. Base- line: See Rationale. Rationale Surveillance is i mportant for assessing the impact of art hritis in Iowa and its related risk behaviors; for describing how arthritis affects various subp opulatio ns (e.g., gender, ag e and race); and for m onitoring trends over time. It is also im portant for targeting treatm ent, an d gui d- ing and evaluating Iowa arthritis progra m ef- forts. Arthritis data is avail able through the Be- havioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sy stem (BRFSS) and other sources, such as outpatient/ ambulatory and Iowa hosp ital discharge data sets. Findings on the im pact of arthritis from surveillance should be clearly and routinely communicat ed to the health care co mmunity , arthritis stakeholders; and t he public thr ough state of arthritis reports and the Iowa arthritis program web page. 411.1 Action Step Throug h 2010, by November 30th of even years, ensure that the arthritis optional m odule is in Iowa's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System surve y every odd year. (An Iowa De- partm ent of Public Health action step.) 411.2 Action Step Throug h 2010, by Decem ber 31st of odd years, collect arthritis and related data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sy stem. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health action step.) 411.3 Action Step Throug h 2010, by June 30th of even years, analy ze arthritis data fro m the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sy stem and other rel ated data sources. (An Iowa De partment of Public Health action step.) 411.4 Action Step Throug h 2010, by September 30th of even years, com plete and disse minate a state o f arthri- tis report that includes subp opulatio n dat a (e.g., gender, age and race) and update the Iowa arthri- tis program web page with odd- year Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sy stem data an d data from other so urces. (An Iowa Depart ment of Public Health action step.) 412 Goal Statement Establish and maintain an Office of Dis- ability and Health w ithin the Io wa De- partment of Public Health. Baseli ne: See Ration ale. Rationale Although people with disabilities are nearly one-fifth of the state' s population, there has been no concerted effort to assure they are inc luded in the state' s health prom otion and preventi on ef- forts. In gene ral, there has been lim ited awar e- ness of the health needs of the disabled, and many provide rs have lacked the inform ation needed to implem ent effective health pr omotion and preventio n for this group. Critical data about disabili ty and health are being gathered at the natio nal and state levels and research i s beginning to identify effective health prom otion and prevention t hat can be of- fered in inclusive, co mmunity settings. This highli ghts the need to iden tify an entity to focus the state's disabilit y and health efforts. On be- half of people with disabilit ies, that entity could create awar eness of the nee d for health prom o- tion and prevention; facilitate the development of core data to identify issues and disparities; gather and di sseminate information on e ffective health prom otion and prevention t o people with disabilities, health planners, and health c are pro- viders; and assist state and local groups t o estab- lish health pr omotion and prevention programs. 412.1 Action Step Throug h 2010, develop and im plement a plan to secure fundi ng to support t he Office of Disability and Health and its activities over the coming decade. (An Iowa Depart ment of Public Chap ter 4 - Page 12 of 2 8 April 2005 Disabilities HI 2010 - Mi d-Course Revision Health and Prevention of D isabilities Policy Council action step.) 413 Goal Statement Develop a disability curriculum and initi- ate other mechanisms to provide up-to- date information to providers and pre- service health education programs. Baselin e: See Ration ale. Rationale The curricula of m any health care educa - tional programs do not spe cifically deal with the needs of persons with disabilities. Even if basic introductor y inform ation is provi ded, inf orma- tion without e xperience is easily forgotte n. Few medical providers have frequent contact s with persons with a disability. Frequent op portunities for further education, plus the abilit y to obtain information on the dis- abilities of a given patient, will im prove care to persons with disabilities. Also, diagnos es and treatment change frequently with new research. Finall y, som e aspects of disability are so rare that appropria te inform ation is difficult t o find. 413.1 Action Step By 2006, convene an ad hoc co mmittee to develop and i mplement strategies for incorporat- ing com petencies in working with people with disabilities into licensure requirem ents of pre- service and continu ing ed ucation progra ms ac- credited by th e Iowa Departm ent of Publ ic Health. (An Iowa Depart ment of Publ ic Health action step.) 413.2 Action Step By 2010, provide pre-service education on a wide variety of disabilit y-related topics to graduate students and post- doctoral fellows throug h the I owa Leadersh ip Education in Neu- rodevelopm ental and Related Disabilities (LEND) program . (A Cent er for Disabilities and Develop ment action step.) 413.3 Action Step By 2010, exp lore collaboration with enti ties such as the Centers for Dis ease Control and Pre-vention (CD C) and the Association of Univer- sity Centers on Disabilities (AUC D) to secure fundin g for e xpansion of communications train- ing for health professionals supported by the Prevention of Secondary Conditi ons Grant. (A Center for Disabilities and Develop ment and Iowa Department of Publi c Health actio n step.) 413.4 Action Step By 2010, ide ntify needed f undin g to provide inform ation on the health c are needs of people with disabiliti es through t he Center for Disabili- ties and Developm ent's Disability Resource Li- brary and a web site to be u pdated m onthly. (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health and Center for Disabilities and Development action step.) 413.5 Action Step By 2010, ide ntify funding and expand de- velopm ent of continui ng ed ucation pro grams. Use the Iowa Communications Network (ICN) or related technologies on advances in pri mary and secondary preventio n, diagnosis and treat- ment of medical problems associat ed wi th dis- abilit y, diversity awareness, and adaptati ons re- quired to provide appropri ate prim ary, secon- dary and terti ary care to pe ople with dis abilities. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health and Cen- ter for Disabilities and Development acti on step.) 414 Goal Statement Perform ac cessibility checks on new fa- cilities leas ed by state agencies within 20 working da ys of rec eiving the request. Baselin e: See Ration ale. Rationale All Iowans, including thos e with disabilities, should be able to access st ate agencies to obtain inform ation a nd services, including transporta- tion, em ployment, social s ervices, nal sup- services be ically self-sufficien t, live y, and enjo y good health. E xecutive Order 46 and the Governor 's directive d ated August 2 3, 1990, require state agencies to c omply with the A meri- cans with Disabilities Act ( ADA) guidelines. April 2005 Chap ter 4 - Page 13 of 2 8 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Re vision Disab ilities Transition pla ns for each state agency to accomplish this were to be co mpleted by July 1992 . However, there has been no struc tured follow-up on agency progress. The Division of Persons with Disabilities i n the Iowa Depart- ment of Hu man Rights m akes reco mmendations, but there is no assurance t hey are being fol- lowed. Onl y the following Iowa entities use this service: Dep artment of Human Services, De- partm ent of Inspections and Appeals, Depart- ment of Corrections, Departm ent of General Services, Div ision of Vocational Rehabilitation Services, Iow a Communica tions Network (ICN), Iowa Department of Publi c Health, and state court adm inistrators. Also, staff in the Division of Persons with Disabilities hear instances where state e mployees have not treated people with disabilities with proper respect or equitable ser- vice. Services will i mprove with appropriate attitude and acco mmodatio n training. 414.1 Action Step By 2010, send an accessibility surve y to Iowa state ag encies, reque sting its completion within five working da ys. (An Iowa Depart ment of Human Rights action st ep.) 414.2 Action Step By 2010, process the accessibility surve y within five working da ys of receiving it. (An Iowa Department of Hu man Rights action step.) 414.3 Action Step By 2010, return the accessibility surve y re- sults to the state agencie s within 10 working days. (An Iowa Department of Hum an Rights action step.) 415 Goal Statement Train city and county emplo yees on the Americans w ith Disabilities Act (ADA) and provide information to city and county governments on making their services phy sicall y accessible to resi- dents w ith disabilities. Baseli ne: See Ra - tionale. Rationale All Iowans, including thos e with disabilities, should have equal access to goods and services from cities an d counties in order to m aintain healthy lifesty les and be participating me mbers of their comm unities. In accordance w ith the Americans wi th Disabilities Act (ADA), each city and county is to have a designated ADA coordinator; however, this indivi dual is usually assigned this as an additional duty and has no training on ADA or si milar state law s. Many people with disabiliti es cannot live where they choose because of current laws and practices. M any are denie d loans for housing because of a l ack of credit history . Only a hand- ful of builders use universal design concepts in their single family housing . Som e people with disabilities cannot fi nd accessible and/or afford- able housing in their comm unities. Ap artment managers oft en are reluctant or unwilling to make ADA acco mmodatio ns and tenant s are often afraid to \"m ake waves\" or si mply don't know their ri ghts. These barrier s have a dra matic i mpact o n the health and well-being of I owans with disabilities and their families, who are often the pri mary caregivers. E stablishing s ystems and policies that enhance choices in living and com munity participation can reduce the social isolat ion that leads to depression. 415.1 Action Step Through 2010, provide at least two train ing sessions annually for city and count y govern- ments to make their facilities and programs ac- cessible on the Division of Persons with Dis- abilities web site via presentations at the League of Cities and Iowa State Association of Coun- ties, or b y any other appr opriate method. (An Iowa Department of Hu man Rights action step.) 415.2 Action Step Throug h 2010, provide cit y nty agen cies with to e nable them to become reso urces for private service providers who have q uestions or need inform ation o n servin g Iowans with dis- abilities. (An Iowa Depart ment of Hu man Rights action step.)

(A Division of Persons with Disabilities action step.) 416 Goal Statement Create access to additional housing for Iowans with disabilitie s. Baseli ne: See Ration ale. Rationale Personally owned or contr olled ho using and personalized support have beco me part of the nation 's agenda as people have challenged the standard way of providing services for p ersons with developmental and other disabilities. Throug hout the nation, ad vocates and innovative service providers have made significant shifts from institutions and gr oup hom es to the crea- tion of communit y support s, includin g housing, that allow people to li ve in hom es of their choos- ing. T his trend is part of a broader shift away from traditional, agency controlled services to- ward a focus on resources that foster personal control and c ommunity inclusion. In 2002, Governor Tom Vilsack challen ged the state to create 1,000 ne w accessible housing units. In 2003, Lt. Govern or Sall y Pederson hosted a hous ing summ it that resulted in a co m- prehensive ho using plan. In 2004, the plan was reviewed and additional action steps ide ntified at the second ho using summ it. Both h ousing summits iden tified partners to determ ine avail- able housing resources and options. 416.1 Action Step Through 2010, assess the needs and barriers of housi ng options for people with disabilities, including an assessment of the capacity of re- sources to meet existing need and recommend strategies to handle any gap s. (An Iowa De- partm ent of Hu man Rights/Division of Persons with Disabilities and Iowa Finance Authorit y action step.) 416.2 Action Step Throug h 2010, provide inf ormation on a f- fordable hous ing resources to Iowans with dis- abilities. (An Iowa Depart ment of Hu man Rights/Division of Persons with Disabilities and Iowa Finance Authorit y action step.) 416.3 Action Step Throug h 2010, engage par tners to im ple- ment the reco mmendations on available housing and gaps thro ugh t he statewide co mprehensive housing plan. (An Iowa Departm ent of Hu man Rights/Division of Persons with Disabilities, Olmstead Re al Choices C onsum er Taskforce, Iowa Program for Assistive Technolog y, and Iowa Finance Authorit y action step.) 416.4 Action Step By 2010, increase the nu mber of tradesmen that are knowledgeable about accessible hous- ing, h ome modifications, and u niversal design. (An Iowa Program for Assistive Technolog y, Iowa Contractor Network/FMR, and Olmstead Real Choices Consumer Ta sk Force acti on step.) 417 Goal Statement Improve Iow a's Medicaid for Emplo yed Persons w ith Disabilities (MEPD) buy-in program b y removing the s ystem' s \"bias to poverty .\" Baseline: See Ration ale. Rationale Iowans with disabilities continue to live longer and m ove to sustain able em ployment and econom ic self-sufficiency . However, much re- mains to be done before em ployment parity is reached. Rem oving the \"bias to povert y\" in Iowa's Medicaid program will rem edy the lack of significant incentives for program enrollees to work in a m eaningful wa y, save or accu mulate asset s, and beco me self-suf ficient. 417.1 Action Step By Septem ber 30, 2 006, encourage the Iowa Depart ment of Hu man Ser vices to restr ucture the prem ium scale by ame nding the current slid- ing fee scale t o encourage people with disabili- ties to earn more. (A Center for Disabilities and April 2005 Chap ter 4 - Page 15 of 2 8 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Re vision Disab ilities Develop ment and Em ployment Policy Group action step.) 417.2 Action Step By Septem ber 30, 2 006, encourage the Iowa Depart ment of Hu man Ser vices to a mend Iowa' s Medicaid poli cies so that people with di sabilities who are currentl y in \"symbolic em ployment\" have the opp ortunit y to m ove to gainf ul em- ployment. (A Center for Disabilities and Devel- and Em ployment Policy Group a ction step.) 417.3 Action Step By Septem ber 30, 2 006, encourage the Iowa Depart ment of Hu man Ser vices to link premi- ums more su bstantially to the \"unearned\" cash benefits, apply ing a hi gher prem ium to the un- earned portio n of Medicaid for Em ployed Per- sons with Disabilities beneficiaries' income and a prem ium equation that applies lower prem ium rates on earnings. (A Center for Disabilities and Develop ment and Em ployment Policy Group action step.) 418 Goal Statement Increase the earning pow er of Io wans with disabil ities to accumulate assets and savings, thereb y creating increased net w orth. Baselin e: See Ration ale. Rationale Incentives are needed to induce Iowans with disabilities to enter and remain in the workforce. Accu mulating assets will provide a powerful incentive. 418.1 Action Step By Septem ber 30, 2 006, promote program policies for creation of wealth and accum ulation of assets through i ncentives for people with dis- abilities to earn m ore and raise resources and ssets li mits. (A Center for Disabilities and De- velopm ent an d Em ployment Polic y Group action step.) 418.2 Action Step By Septem ber 30, 2 006, encourage the Iowa Depart ment of Hu man Ser vices to increase the allowable resource provisi ons of Medic aid for Employed Persons with Disabilities by allowing wage earner s to have higher asset and re source limits, thereby providing i ncentives to earn more. (A Center for Disabilities and Develop- ment and Emplo yment Policy Grou p action step.) 418.3 Action Step By Septem ber 30, 2 006, track the perform- ance of the approved accounts (e.g., m edical savings, retirem ent savings, assistive technol- ogy) to assess effects.

(An Ol mstead Real Choices Task Force action step.) 422 Goal Statement Expand the role of the State Level Transportation Coordination Council to coordinate among publicl y funded pro- grams that provide transportation. Base- line: See Rationale. April 2005 Chap ter 4 - Page 17 of 2 8 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Re vision Disab ilities Rationale Agencies that fund transp ortation need t o work together to encour age the enterprises they fund t o coord inate their efforts so the fu nds can be spent m ore effectively and the benefits of public spending can reach all Iowans, including persons with disabilities. For this reason, a State Level Transportation Advi sory Council was es- tablished in 1 993, but became inactive sometim e after 1996. I n April 20 01, partially as a result of Healthy Iowans 201 0, the Council was reacti- vated, but last ed for onl y about 1 8 months be- fore falling into inactivit y again. While the council was active, it m et quar- terly to discu ss transportation coord ination, or regula tory barriers to coor- dination, and assist the Iow a Depart ment of Transportation in review ing com pliance with the coordination mandates in Chapter 324 A of the Code of Iowa. Membership originally included the Iow a depart ments of transportation, hum an services, elder affairs, and education, plus the Iow a State Association of Counties. When the council was reactivated in 200 1, the Io wa Department of Public Health, Workforce Develop ment, and the Iowa League of Cities were added. In a ddition, the rules establishing t he council pr ovide that additional public or private sector members could participate. Interest was al so expressed in adding co nsumer representation and the Iowa Department of Hu man Rights' Divisio n of Per- sons with Disabilities to the council, even thoug h the Di vision d oes not adm inister any transportation fundi ng. 422.1 Action Step minim um of quar- terly meetings of the State Level Transportation Coordinatio n Council. (An Iowa Department of Transportation/Coordinati on Council action step.) 422.2 Action Step By July 2005, review council membership and attendance policies. (A Coordinati on Cou n- cil action step.) 423 Goal Statement Expand availability of publicl y funded transportati on for persons with di sabili- ties and all others thro ughout Io wa. Baselin e: See Ration ale. Rationale Increasing the hours of tra nsit service is critical to i mproving acces s to participation in society by people who rel y on p ublic tra nsit, which includ es a large percentage of persons with disabiliti es. In 2000, Healthy Iowans 201 0 identified the welfare reform and/or welfare-to- work progra ms as providing the best pr ospect for fundi ng expansion of transit hours. Eleven transit sy stems succe ssfully applied for the first round of fu nding u nder the Federal Transit Ad- ministration's (FTA) Job Acces s/Rever se Com- mute (JARC) program in 1999, using Te mporary Aid to Needy Fam ilies (TANF) funds as a par- tial match. The num ber of transit sy stems estab- lishing new services under these programs in- creas ed by 50% as a r esult of inform ation ses- sions held b y the departments of transpo rtation and hum an se rvices, which is consistent with the original Healt hy Iowans 20 10 work plan. Every effort was made to ensure that the services provided during the additional hours are available to all citizens - not just those com ing off welfare. This is c onsistent with Iowa's man- date for coordination of publicl y funded trans- portation and the concept of creating long-ter m solutions to the transportation pr oblem s of for- mer w elfare r ecipients. Similar efforts would be ap propriate to e n- sure that the maxi mum possible num ber of citi- zens benefit from transportation fun ds through other state and federal program s. A recent repo rt from the federal government identifies 62 f ederal programs that can fund transportation. The m ajority of these progra ms typically focus on a single clientele, but can also be used to hel p supp ort coo rdinated pu blic transportation. Transpor tation benefits f or peo- ple are the sa me whether t heir transportation is provided by a public transit system or by a hu- man servic es agency . How ever, more members of the comm unity are likel y to benefit fro m pub- lic expenditures on transportation if the s ervices Chap ter 4 - Page 18 of 2 8 April 2005 Disabilities HI 2010 - Mi d-Course Revision are provided by, or at least coordinated through, public transit. An opport unity to im prove m obility for all Iowans is lost each ti me a grant application for one of these programs is su bmitted with no transportation com ponent. Maxim izatio n of overall transportation benef its to Iowans that are allowable under the progr ams falls short when transportation fundi ng is o btained but use d only to establish exclusive services for the cli ents of a single progra m,. 423.1 Action Step By Dece mber 2005, m eet with each stat e agency that a dministers funding under federal program s with the abilit y to support transporta- tion to discuss the need for expanded tra nsporta- tion opport unities and to explore the m echanics of using program funds to support coordinated public transit. (An Iowa Departm ent of Trans- portation/Co ordination Co uncil action step.) 423.2 Action Step By Dece mber 2006, establish a mechani sm to anticipate applications under selected federal program s and to brin g program applicants and transit sy stems together to develop transporta- tion com ponents which will result in incr eased availability of transit services. (An Iowa De- partm ent of Transporta tion/ Coordinatio n Coun- cil action step.) 424 Goal Statement Establish a central repository for infor- mation on availability of public transit and human service transportation throughout Io wa. Baseline: See Rationale. Rationale Iowa cities o ver 20,0 00 population are served by an urban transit system , while rural counties are part of a regional sy stem where lev- els of service vary from 21 hours-a-day/7 days- a-we ek to one day every other week or less. The web site for the Iowa Departm ent of Transporta- tion gives hours of service in the largest com- munities, but there is no central source of infor- mation about the level of service available in smaller communities and rural areas. Many re- gional transit systems do not publish schedules in the comm unities they cover. A centra lized source of such inform ation would assist the pub- lic, who m ay wish to include transit ser vices when deciding on a communit y in whic h to li ve or when plan ning a visit t o another comm unity . The inform ation would also be a baseline to measure tren ds in the avail ability of transit ser- vices, and possibly help in designing programs to increase the availability of services in select ed areas. If infor mation on the availability of transportation services fro m human ser vices agencies w as also included, the value would be increased s everal-fold. It might also assist in securing further coordination between human service and public transpor tation pro viders. 424.1 Action Step By July 2005, surve y Iowa transit sy stems and hum an se rvices agenci es to docum ent the services avail able in each Iowa incorporated city. (An Io wa Department of Transpo rtation/ Coordinatio n Council action step.) 424.2 Action Step Dece mber 2005, surve y hum an servi ce agencies that provide trans portation services to collect target ed transportation inform ation. (An Iowa Department of Transportation/ C oordina- tion Council action step.) 424.3 Action Step By April 2006, publish tra nsit availability data on the In ternet.

Basel ine: See Ration ale. Rationale The Am ericans with Disabilities Act (ADA) guarantees co nsumers of public transpor tation several rights . To ensure com plianc e with this provision of t he law, people with disabilities must understand their rig hts. 425.1 Action Step By Decem ber 200 6, develo p an educatio nal program on public transpor tation i n col- laboration wit h transpor ers. (An Iowa of Transportation/ C oordina- tion Council action step.) 425.2 Action Step By Decem ber 2007, present the disability education program in each of Iowa' s metropoli- tan areas.

(An I owa Depart ment of Transporta- tion/Coor dination Cou ncil action step.) 426 Goal Statement Refocus the service sy stem to in clude innovative models for the delivery of cost effective, community -based ser- vices in rural and urban areas that meet the medical, ps ycholog ical, behavi oral, emplo yment, and housing needs of all persons w ith disabilitie s. Baseli ne: See Ration ale. Rationale Iowa must ensure the availabilit y of com- munity services. The new focus is on de velop- ing in novativ e individ ual and fam ily-centered services that offer a range of options, from day care to out-of-hom e pla cement, through acces si- ble program s and facilities. Fundi ng should be directed towa rd innovative, cost-effectiv e ser- vices designed by persons with disabilities to meet the their needs and to maxim ize independ- ence and participation in t he community . 426.1 Action Step By 2006, as required b y House File 253 7 (signed into law April 19, 2004 , and eff ective July 1, 2004), plan, collect and analy ze data on system costs and projected costs; identify reve- nue sources a nd cost proje ctions in support of system redesign; and support legislation seeking enact ment of sy stem redesign with identified revenue sources and cost projects. (A MH/MR/DD/BI Co mmission and I owa Depart- ment of Hu man Services a ction step.) 426.2 Action Step By 2008, im plem ent service vouchers and counseling fo r people eligi ble for Medicaid Home and Community -Based Services w aivers, providi ng them the opportunit y to choose and direct their own services. This will incorporate non-traditional services such as personal assis- tance services. (An Iowa Departm ent of Hu man Services in c onsultation w ith the Olm stead Real Choices Consumer Task Force action ste p.) 427 Goal Statement Eliminate the county of legal settlement as a criterion for receiving services. Baselin e: See Ration ale. Rationale The first step for many Iowans with disabili- ties to live in the community of their choice is to be able to acc ess services any place in Iowa (not linked to thei r count y of legal settlement). Io- wans without disabilities choose where they live based on em ployment and educational opportu- nities, fa mily and friends, cultural and re crea- tional op portunities, and a host of ot her factors. Many disabled Iowans do not have th ose options because of the way services are funded. Iowa' s outdated s ystem of count y-based \"legal settle- Chap ter 4 - Page 20 of 2 8 April 2005 Disabilities HI 2010 - Mi d-Course Revision ment\" must be elim inated for all Iowans to have equal acce ss to housing and the option to live independentl y. Legal settlem ent requires a pe- riod of reside nce in a count y before quali fying for services. 427.1 Action Step Through 2010, im plement the legal settle- ment dispute resolution process r equired by House File 2537, sig ned into law April 19, 2 004, and effective July 1, 2004. The process settles legal settlement disputes for people receiving services under Code Chapter 222 (state resource centers); Cod e Chapter 230 (state mental health institutes); and Code Chapt er 249A (m edical ] progra m). (An Iowa De- partment of Hu man Services a ction step.) 427.2 Action Step By 2005, co mplete planning required by House File 2537 so legisla tion changi ng legal settlement to legal residency can be drafted for consideration during the 2006 legislative ses- sion. Planni ng shoul d: Establish statewide standard of pr oof of residency ; Include a data sy stem for i dentify ing resi- dency of eligi ble people; Determine how people in count y by court order of crim inal sentence will beco me count y residents (pre sumably upon leaving court super- vision); Include contested residency dispute reso lu- tion; and Address other im plementati on problem s. (An MH/MR/DD/BI Co mmission actio n step.) 427.3 Action Step By 2010, con tingent u pon appropriate legis- lative action, replace legal settlement wi th legal residency . (An Iowa Dep artment of Human Services a ction step.) 428 Goal Statement Assure that persons w ith disabilities un- derstand the health and other benefits of assistive technolog y, how to sele ct and obtain assistive technolog y, and have access to information on health-related funding sources for assistive technol- ogy. Baseline: See Rationale. Rationale Assistive technolog y enabl es people with disabilities to live independently , be suc cessful in school and work, and be fully inclu ded in their communities. Assistive technolog y can prevent secondary disabiliti es and can be used to make health prom otion and injur y prev ention program s accessible. People with disabilities need current and ong oing inform ation about t he benefits of assistive technology , the kinds avail- able, and how to obtai n it. 428.1 Action Step Throug h 2010, provide o ngoing inform ation and referral to all Iowa ns about health-related and other assistive technology via Iowa COMPASS. (An Iowa Program for Assi stive Technolog y/Iowa COMPASS action step.) 428.2 Action Step Through 2010, provide assistive technology awar eness in collaboration with other dis ability - related organizations as funding allows. (An Iowa Program for Assistive Technolog y action step.) 428.3 Action Step Through 2010, provide technical assista nce on assistive technology to disabilit y-related con- sumer entities and advocacy organizations to increase their capacity to provide assistive tech- nolog y to co nsumers as funding allows. (An Iowa Program for Assistive Technolog y action step.) 428.4 Action Step Throug h 2010, contin ue to collaborate with community and state progr ams to provid e awar eness an d training on the benefits of assis- tive technolo gy to people f rom minority popula- tions, in r ural areas, and other under-represented April 2005 Chap ter 4 - Page 21 of 2 8 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Re vision Disab ilities populati ons as fundin g allows. (An Iowa Pro- gram for Assistive Technolog y action ste p.) 429 Goal Statement Assure that health care providers recog- nize the be nefits of assistive technolog y, provide information about assistive technolog y to their clients, make appro- priate referrals assistive technolog y, provide direct assistive y ser- vices, their client's a to third-party Baselin y enabl es many peop le to live inde pendentl y, be suc- cessful in sch ool and work, and fully included in their communities. It can prevent secondary disabilities and be used to make health prom o- tion and injury prevention program s accessible to maximize independence. Health care provid- ers need more information and training on all aspects of assistive technolog y. 429.1 Action Step Throug h 2010, provide o ngoing inform ation and referral t hrough Iowa COMPASS t o health care providers on m edically appropriate and health-related assistive technology. (An Iowa Program for Assistive Technolo gy/Iowa COMPASS a ction step.) 429.2 Action Step h 2010, provide o ngoing inform ation on assistive technology to the University of Iowa's Center of Excellence on Disabilities training pr ogram for students in medicine, nurs- ing, ps ychology , work, recreation ther- apy, and speech language t herapy as funding allows. (An Iowa Program for Assistive Tech- nolog y action step.) 429.3 Action Step Throug h 2010, collaborate with other en ti- ties, including Easter Seal' s Iowa Rural Solu-tions, to do awareness and training activ ities on assistive technology with r ural service providers and other under-represented groups as funding allows. (An Iowa Program for Assistive Tech- nolog y and R ural Solutio ns action step.) 429.4 Action Step Through 2010, provide technical assista nce on assistive technology to the Iowa Dep artment of Elder Affairs and to area agencies on aging health and co mmunity education service provi d- ers as funding allows. (An Iowa Progr am for Assistive Technolo gy and Area Agencies on Aging action step.) 430 Goal Statement Increase access to assistive technolog y through polic y change s and increased funding options. Baseli ne: See Rationale. Rationale Publicl y funded program s in health, h ous- ing, em ployment, aging, an d education must develop policies that better com bine re sources and m ove the state toward non-categorical cov- erage of assi stive technology and appropriate home and vehicle modifications throu ghout life. For people to live as independentl y as po ssible, home and ve hicle modifications are nec essary . Many aids to independent l iving, or low- tech assistive technology, are not covered under tra- ditional healt h policies. Health insurance pro- gram s should provi de cove rage for a bro ad range of assistive technology rather than use exclusive lists. People need hom e and vehicle m odifica- tions based on individual needs rather than pro- grammatic caps. People in care facilities should also have access to assi stive technology . 430.1 Action Step During 20 05, review policies and practices and initiate policy change on the pr ovisi on of adapted wheelchairs and other assistive t echnol- ogy to residents of care facilities. (An Iowa Program for Assistive Technolo gy in collabora- tion with t he University of Iowa' s Colleg e of Law Clinical Program action step.)

(An Ol mstead Real Choices Task Force, Iowa Program for A ssistive Tech nology, and University of Iowa's C ollege of Law Clini- cal Progra m action step.) 430.3 Action Step By 2008, increase the nu mber of people with disabilities who obtain services through their count y managed care plans and who kn ow and exercise their rights. (An Iowa Depart ment of Human Services/Ol mstead Real Choices Task Force action step.) 431 Goal Statement Establish local disabil ity peer su pport groups to provide a mechanism for mu- tual support and to advocate and mobi- lize for change. Baseli ne: See Rationale. Rationale Historically , society has kept persons with disabilities \"with their own kind.\" No one wants to return to the segregation and isolation associ- ated with that philoso phy. However, peer sup- port is uni versally defined by peop le with dis- abilities as cri tical to their well-being. P eople draw strength from their co mmon experiences by sharing information and resources, an d by validating experiences. Peer support comes in a variety of form s friendships, o ne-on-one pe er counseling (as throug h centers for indepen dent livin g), or local peer support groups. Peer support can b e inter- action am ong people with s imilar disabilities, although \"cross-disability \" interactions are often preferred. Peer support m ay also include mutual support, i nformation sharing, training opportuni- ties, peer counseling, technical assi stanc e, social and/or recreat ional opportunities, advocacy , and systems change. The focus of t his goal recognizes that there are many barriers to the developm ent of support groups. Barri ers include 1) availability and costs of transportation and personal assis tance services (incl uding interpreters); 2) li mited community organizing and leadership experi- ence on the part of local leaders with disabilities; 3) inadequate adm inistrative capacity and re- sources; and 4) lack of funding for long-ter m succes s. 431.1 Action Step By 2008, thr ough a coalition of advocacy and hum an service groups, identif y and l everage resources nee ded to develop a network of local cross-disabili ty and single-disabilit y peer sup- port and self-advocacy groups (to include tradi- tionall y under served areas). The y will pr ovide mutual support and peer counseling, i nformation and resource sharing, social opportunitie s, and/or advoc acy on the loc al, state and national levels. (A Center for Disabilities and Develop- ment and Developm ental Disability Council ac- tion step.) 431.2 Action Step By 2006, dev elop and m aintain a list of local peer support groups and their contacts, and m ake that inform ation available to people with dis- abilities as resources per mit.

(A Developmental Disability Council action step.) 432 Goal Statement Establish a unified, cross-disability presence within Io wa to articulate the demand for change. Baseli ne: See Ration - ale. Rationale A state wide organization is clearly needed to connect and unif y Iowans with disabiliti es. This entity must include opportunities for leadership, polic y trainin g, and i nfluen cing pu blic p olicy on disabilit y and health. The entit y must be managed and directed b y Iowans with disabilities, as well as reach out t o family groups, provi ders, v endors, profe ssionals, and the business ys must be found to colla borate with non-traditional groups (e.g., the elderly ) without ompromising the voice of Iowans with disabi lities. 432.1 Action Step By 2006, fund a dedicated staff to promote inform ation sharing am ong peer support groups and people w ith disabilitie s and coordinate ac- tivities related to this goa l. (A Developmental Disability Council action step.) 432.2 Action Step By 2009, con duct an annua l, statewide con- ference to prom ote networking am ong people with disabiliti es, and provi de for the advance- ment of issues of im portan ce to those attending, as resource s permit.

Rationale Count y emergency managem ent co mmittees in Iowa are re presented by local health care agencies, public safety , print and broadcast me- dia, local govern ment agen cies, civil defense, transportation, and industry that use chemical s regulated b y the federal Emergency Planning and Comm unity Right-t o-Know Act of 1986 . Emergency managem ent people who pla n for potential emergenci es have additional prob- lems concerning people with disabilities. People who have diff iculty understanding directions or who are heari ng im paired r equire special notifi- cation. Thos e with mobility problems may need special help to evacuate or obtain em ergency medical or nutritional supplies. Becaus e people with disabiliti es are not alway s included i n plan- ning, their ne eds may not be addressed. To as- sure that they are, each loc al emergency man- agem ent co mmittee should include at least one person with a disabilit y. 433.1 Action Step By 2006, cou nty emergency m anagement committees and directors will identif y groups and/or individuals in their service ar eas that may require assist ance. (An Iowa Depart ment of Public Safety/Division of Homeland Security and Em ergency Management action step.) 433.2 Action Step By 2008, include at least one person with a disabilit y or one who has a special health care need on each of the 25 eme rgency management committees.

Baseline: See Rationale. Rationale As the stories of surviv ors and others who died in t he World Trade Center Towers illus- trate, so me people with dis abilities were able to evacuate safely and ot hers died. Som e people who had expe rienced the first attack on the Towers in 19 93 had participated in regul ar evacuation drills. Others had not practiced evacuation or were unawar e of safe exits . Iowa has the potential for man-made an d natural disasters. Potentially hazardous materi- als may be ca rried on or in rail lines, barges, pipelines, int erstate and federal highway s. Small airports and grain elevators may also be the site of a disaster. Ever yone should have a plan, even th ough Iowans are more likely to ex- perience snowstorm s, floods, fires, or to rnadoes. All Iowans should assess their needs and make appropriate pl ans regardle ss of the emer gency . 434.1 Action Step In 200 5 and 2006, provi de a minimum of six presentations each y ear to disability groups about persona l preparedness plans.

The chapter' s action steps address i m- provem ents to school healt h services, early childhood services, health education, phy sical education, and resource ac cess. Speci al consid- eration is given to race, ethnicity , age, gender, physical and mental ability/disabilit y, socioeco- nomic status, and rural versus urban loca les. Reducing qua lity-of-life dis parities is an overarching g oal of Health y Iowans 201 0. In support of thi s goal, the Io wa Department of Education (I DE) creates p artnerships with other organizations to prom ote, fund or directly pro- vide education for people with disabiliti es and other special needs populat ions. Exam ples of services inclu de fundi ng sign langua ge inter- preters, an agree ment betw een IDE and the Iowa Braille and Sight Saving Sc hool f or services for people with vision needs, and disabilit y-friendl y modifications to the IDE web site. The Iowa Department of Education maintains an electronic foreign language library for people with disabili- ties who are not fluent i n English. T he library contains documents and res ources in 23 lan- guages, and is acc essible o n-line at http://www.m ynclb.com . The website can be viewed in eight languages. Since the first version of Healthy Iowans 2010 was distributed b y the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) five y ears ago, public health priorities have shifte d at the state and fed- eral levels, an d funding from these sourc es has declined. Althoug h som e of the origi nal goals have been met, others requi re additional work before they can be com plete. Still other s need updating, incl uding the addition, m odification or removal of ac tion steps and mea surement crite- ria to make them current.

Goal Statements & Action Steps 51 Goal S tatement Increase to 91 % the pu blic high sc hool graduation rate w hile reducing dispari- ties associated with gender, race and ethnicity . Baseli ne: 200 0, 88.7%; 2001, 89.2%; 2002, 89.4%; and 2003, 90.4%. Rationale Research shows that high s chool graduat es are more likel y to be em ployed, earn higher wages, have l ess reli ance on public assis tance, are less likely to be single parents, and, for women, have children at an older age (The Ur- ban Institute, a nonpartisan econom ic and social polic y researc h organization). \"No Child Left Behind\" (NCLB) legislation, enacted b y Con- gress in 2001, requires stat es to collect data to measure public high schoo l graduation r ates and use them as an indicator fo r identif ying schools that need im provement. Iowa is doubl y fortu- nate in that it s long-term average high s chool graduation rat e is am ong the top three in the na- tion and that this rate has been increasin g annuall y for t he past several y ears (W Haney et al. The Educ ation Pipeline in the United States 1970- 2000; I DE's Annual Condition of Educa- tion, 2 004, p. 187).

(http://www.state.ia.us /educate/fis/pre/coer/index.html ) 51.1 Action Step By 2010, dev elop and ado pt state-level poli- cies and guidelines to increase the annual high school gradua tion rate to 9 1%, as measured b y Iowa Department of Education data. ( An Iowa Department of Education a ction step.) 51.2 Action Step By 2010, narr ow the gende r gap in publi c high school graduation by attaining at least a 91% rate for fem ales and a rate for males that differs fro m the rate for females by no more than 1%. The data indicate that fem ales have consis- tently higher rates than males. The 2003 baseline is 91.7% for fem ales and 89.1% for males. (An Iowa Department of Educat ion ac- tion step.) 51.3 Action Step By 2010, dec rease r acial and ethnic dis pari- ties am ong graduation rates b y raising t hem to 86% for Ame rican Indians, 74% for Hispanics, and 81% for African A mericans. 74.5% for African A mericans; by comparison, the rate wa s 91% for Asian s and 91.3% for wh ites. (An Iowa Department of Education action step.) 51.4 Action Step By 2010, increase statewide average dail y attendance (ADA) in kinde rgarten throu gh eighth grade (K-8) to 96%, as measured by Iowa Department of Education a ttendance data. The \"No Child Left Behind\" (NCLB) legislation de- for ADA, Iowa has desi gnated the ADA for ele mentary and m iddle school stu dents as the K-8 indicator for NCLB accountabilit y. Baseline, 2003: 95.6% . (An I owa Department of Educat ion ac- tion step.) 51.5 Action Step By 2010, increase to 31,000 the num ber of public school special education students partici- pating in special education less than 21% of the day.

Baseline: 275 districts, 20 04, all using the \"allowable growth\" fundi ng method provided in Iowa Code Chapter 252.3 8-41. (An Iowa Department of Education action step.) 51.7 Action Step By 2006, all public school districts will have a wellnes s policy in accordance with the Federal Child Nutriti on and WIC Reauthorization Act and as verified b y the Iowa Department of Edu- cation. Baseli ne: 0. (An Iowa Depart ment of Education action step.) Chap ter 5 Page 4 of 13 April 2005 Educational & Community -Based Program s HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision 52 Goal S tatement To build a s tronger fou ndation for aca- demic achievement, at least ten schools will provide a set of basic health support services for students (see action step 52.2 for th e minimum set of services), and 81 % of school districts w ill employ a full-time nurse w ho will, among other things, provide or advocate for these services. Baseline, 2003: for sch ool di stricts with nurse s, 76%; for scho ols offerin g all the basic supp ort services li sted in 52.2, 0. Rationale When children have the ap propriate health supports, academ ic achievem ent improves. School nurses directly provide or facilitate ac- cess to neede d health supports for stude nts, provide fro ntline interventi ons for dispar ons, i mplement pu blic health pri nciples, and assist in meeting many other Healthy Io- wans goals. Seventy -six percent of Iowa school districts in 20 02-2003 reported havi ng hired a sch ool nurse, and 35 % reported a nurse-to-stud ent ratio of 1:750 or less. This ratio, which is among t he data that districts provide t o the Iowa Depart- ment of Education each y ear, has been a ttained by increasingly fewer districts due to budget reductions and legislative decisions. The state- wide average mean ratio of school nurse-to- students was 1:878 during 2002- 2003, and the nurse-to-building ratio wa s 1:3.5. A research- based present ation called \"I mproving A cademic Achieve ment by Meeting Student Health Needs\" was developed in Februar y 2003 and can be ac- cessed in various form ats at http://www.state.ia.us/educ ate/ec ese/cfcs/hpi/do c/iaa.ppt 52.1 Action ease to 81% t he proport ion of public school districts that report hirin g a nurse. Continue to follow data and trends, and prom ote school health services to build support for in- creasing the num ber of sch ool nurses. Baseline, IDE's 200 4 Certified Annual Report: 76 %. (An Iowa Department of Education action step.) 52.2 Action Step By 2010, adopt a plan to es tablish a co m- prehensive school-based s ystem of healt h supports that are selected by their abilit y to im - prove acade mic achieve ment as indicated by evidence from published resear ch. Begin im - plem enting th e system in ten Iowa schools. The system must include, at a mini mum, student health services, phy sical fitness, nutrition, health education, a h ealthy and safe school envi ron- ment, fam ily and comm unity involvem ent, and staff educatio n on health and wellness. Successful i mplem entation will involve c ol- lection of data to measure t he health and the acade mic achieve ment outco mes associ ated with these support s. The intent is that these ten schools will be a model for other districts, al- thoug h statewide im plemen tation of t he school- based health supports s ystem is not anticipated by 2010. Sou rce: IDE, Certified Annual Report, 2003 . (An Io wa Department of Ed ucation action step.) 53 Goal S tatement Increase to 40 % the proportion of 3- and 4-year-old children served statewide in quality , Iowa accredited pre-school pro- grams, including Head Start, earl y childhood education, Title I, and special early childh ood education. Baseli ne, 2003: 15%. Rationale The state-funded Shared Visions qualit y preschool pro gram reported statewide enroll- ment of 2,36 0 children in 2003. The Go vernor's goal is that 9 0% of three and four year olds have access to high quality progra ms. Curre nt state- wide enrollment is 15% . Fundin g has de creased the last two years for Share d Visions and Em - powerm ent programs http://www.state.ia.us/educ ate/ec ese/is/cdcc/doc uments.htm l. 53.1 Action Step By 2010, support establishment of a sy stem that coordinat es early child hood progra ms and reporting m ethods to ensur e that necessary ser- vices, including education and health services, April 2005 Chap ter 5 Page 5 of 13 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Educat ional & Community-Based Program s are reaching all eligible children. The I owa Learns Council, a public policy advisor y group, recommends that this s ystem: 1) build an integrated, co mprehensive early care health an d education s ystem ; 2) prom ote seamless transition between the early care hea lth and educa tion s ystem and the K-12 s ystem; 3) unive rsal pre-scho ol for 3- to 4- year-olds; 4) support t he implementation of Iowa' s early learning standards; and 5) identif y and provide communit y and early childhood providers with a directory of recommende d research-ba sed fa mily- support servi ces.

(An Early Childhoo d systems, including Iowa Early Chil dhood Learning Standards and Iowa Quality Preschool Pr ogram Standards, action step.) 54 Goal S tatement Policies and guidelines will exist to en- sure that school health education and physical ed ucation are compliant w ith statutory education program require- ments [281 IAC 12.5(256)]. Baseline: Compli ance data have not been compil ed and will be obtained through co mpletion of the first action step u nder thi s goal . Rationale Each y ear, 20 % of Iowa school districts are accredited. This process includes review ing their school-i mprovement plans for compliance with the health education a nd phy sical education requirem ents in the Iowa Adm inistrative Code. The current tight budgeta ry conditions may have adversely affected school district co mpliance in one or both of these are as. This creates a need to establish a clear bas eline that fully reflects the administrative code requirem ents, monitor schools for continued compliance with the base- line and requi rements, and, to the extent possible, provide support to address any defi- ciencies. Comprehensive School-Improvem ent Plans will soon be a ccessible on the Web, facilitating the collection and com parison of data o n the availability and type of he alth content provided to students. Likewise, collection of dat a from a new Iowa Departm ent of Education init iative called Project EASIER (Electronic Acc ess for Iowa Education Records) will be available after 2005 . Its aims are to im prove indivi dual student record transfer b y reducin g data burden; encour- age better decision-making by establishin g and maintaining cost-effective access methods; and transfer ac curate and timel y education inform a- tion to districts, postsecondary instituti ons, and the Iowa Dep artment of Education. 54.1 Action Step By 2010, gat her statewide inform ation on the health content of school district improve- ment plans and develop a report describing how districts incorporate the broad state law s and rules requiring health cont ent in the curr iculum . Distribute the report to districts, state an d local public health officials, the Legislature, a nd other interested parties. Baseline: None. (An I owa Department of Education a ction step.) 54.2 Action Step By 2010, 100% of Iowa public schools will advocate for the health of children and a doles- cents by sharing their Iowa Youth Survey (IYS) results and Youth Risk Be havior Surve y (YRBS) results with the Community Health Needs A ssessment and Health Im provement Plan (CHNA/ HIP).

Baseli ne: Five com munity colleg es have provide d some data. Rationale The Centers f or Diseas e Control and Preven- tion docum ented six categories of priority health-risk behaviors am ong college age youn g adults. These six behaviors are responsible for disease and many deaths among college stu- dents. Education that is focused on these health- risk behavior s has the potential to im pact future lifesty le beha viors. Inform ation does no t exist on how Iowa post-secondary instituti ons address the six health-risk behavior s. 55.1 Action Step By 2008, sen d an explanat ory letter and supplemental inform ation to all comm unity col- leges requesti ng that they gather culturally specific and age-appropriat e student info rmation on the six priority health-risk behavior a reas, in a manner relevant to racial and ethnic m inorities and special needs populati ons, and sub mit the data to Iowa Department of Public Health. (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health and Depart- ment of Education action step.) 55.2 Action Step By 2010, util ize phone calls, e-m ail mes- sages, follow-up letters, personal visits, and other rem inders as needed to ensure that 100% of comm unity colleges will provi de Iowa De- partment of Public Health the data descri bed in Action Step 5 5.1.

O nly econom ic concerns, such as unem ployment, taxes, schools, and government budgets, rank higher in citizen concerns. A statewide community -health needs asse ssment found that en vironm ental concerns were among the top pri orities. Iowans are concerned about the qualit y of their drinki ng water, recreational waters, indoor and out door air qualit y, lead poisoning, safe housing, a nd hazardous and solid waste. Concern today is focused p rimarily on the health effects of envi ronmental contam ination and is a major ele ment of the public 's need for environm ental protection. The public is bombarded with reports fro m the media, governm ent officials, and the private sector that state or hint at adverse heal th effects fro m environm ental contam ination. However, risks from environm ental contam ination are not clearly explained. Besides, the best solutions for dealing wit h them frequently are not discussed. Officials de mand more sophisticated answers and expect d etails on actual risks and real solutions. As a re sult, the public is concerned, and at times confused, about the q uality of its environm ent and the effects it may have on health. Local public health, building officials, conservationists, medical professionals, and the public need better as sessment of environmental data to full y understand actual and perceived risks. Asse ssment also all ows local officials to deal with hig h-risk conditi ons and instit ute actions that will reduce or elim inate a problem . Healthy Iowans 201 0 responds to these needs. The environm ental health goals and action steps focus on 1) docu mented hea lth and safety effects from existing environm ental conditions; 2) the assessmen t of risks; and 3) actions or solutions for significantly reducing exposure to e nvironm ental contam inants. A total of 75 persons representing state, local, university, private, e nvironm ental health and protectio n interests were form ally involved in the process of developing this chapter' s original envir onmental health goals and action steps. Progress Significant progress was made in environm ental health durin g the first hal f of the decade. How ever, many challenges re main. Achievements in environm ental health include establish ment of the Division of Environmental Health in the Iowa Depart ment of Publi c Health and a state revolvin g-loan program for on-site waste water treat ment sy stems. It also includes a competitive grant to bui ld environm ental health capacity , federal fundin the relationship b etween environm ental exp osures and hum an health outcomes in a rural Iowa count y, and an increase in the percentage of Iowa children who are tested for lead poi soning. Each of these achieve ments is described below. During the su mmer of 200 0, the Iowa Department of Public Health consolidate d all program s in environm ental health under one division, the Division of E nvironm ental Health. Such progra ms had been spread throug hout t he departm ent. The reorganization was made possible by funding from the master tobacco settlement. Better collaboration and April 2005 Chap ter 6 - Page 1 of 19 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Environm ental Health communication am ong environm ental health program s has resulted. The Iowa De partment of Natural Re sources created a revolving loan f und t hat allo ws owners of non-com pliant private sewers to appl y for low interest loans to repair or replace their se ptic systems. In the short tim e since its cre ation, over one m illion d ollars has been provid ed and over 100 system s have been up dated. The Iowa Departm ent of Public Health, Division of E nvironm ental Health co mpeted for and received in 2001 a 3-year grant from the Centers for D isease Control and Prevention (CDC) to buil d environm ental health capacity at the state and local levels. It enabled the Iowa Department of Public Health to pr ovide t raining to local and state environmental health practitioners on the ten essential services and core co mpetencies to practice environmental health. Addit ionall y, mini-grants were distributed to local health departm ents an d regional consortium s to build capacity to address environm ental health. Following succes sful implem entation of t he gran t durin g the fi rst three years, it will be ex tended t hrough 2007. In 200 2, the Iowa Department of Publ ic Health, Division of E nviro nmental Health received federal funding to conduct a \"Comprehens ive Asse ssment of Rural H ealth in Iowa\" (CARHI) in an Iowa count y. This project is exa mining potential associations between known envir onmental exposures and hu man health in Carroll Count y. Funding will c ontinue throug h 2006. CARHI is a collaborative project between Division of En vironmental Health staff and University of Iowa researcher s. He alth-care providers and count y officials are also play ing a critical role. The percenta ge of Iowa children receiving at least one blood-lead test before the age of six has increased from 26.3% for the 19 91 birth cohort to 57.4% for the 200 0 birth co hort. The amount of state fundin g available for this program has increased from $39,547 in 2000 to approxim ately $3 50,000 in 2005. The B ureau of Lead Poisoni ng Preventio n now has four employees who are bilingual in Spanish and English to meet the needs of Iowa's growing Latino po pulation. To receive continued f unding from the CDC in 20 04, the Bureau was required to de velop a \"lead eli mination plan\" with actions inate od lead poisoni ng in Iowa by 2010 . Goal 68 and its corresponding ac tion steps wer e revised to reflect changes in the federal lead programs, Iow a's lead eli mination plan, current baseline data, and if necess ary, revised target s and/or dates for reaching the targets. One challenge to environm ental health over the last several y ears h as been budget cu ts at the federal, state and local levels. Emerging issues in environm ental health also present significant challenges. They include mold, housin g standards, the \"built environment,\" antibiotics in surface water , air qualit y around anim al confinements, and concern about the safe levels of mercury in fish. Each agency responsible for an action step in this chapter has filed a plan of com pliance with the Olmstead decisio n and Executive Order 27. All m aterials and services des cribed in this chapter will be provided as described in the plan. Goal Statements & Action Steps 61 Goal S tatement Determine the prevalence of contaminants of health concern in 100 % of small tow n private w ells in concentrations exceeding the Environmental Protection Agenc y health advisory levels (HALs) or maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for dri nking water. Baseline: 0. Rationale Private drinki ng water wells are not routinely sampled for the a rray of contaminants that public w ater supplies sam ple for as required by the Safe Drinking Water Act. While public water supply users pay for this sam pling throu gh their regular water bills, private well water monitoring is done at the well owner's initiative. The Iowa De partment of Natural Re sources Chap ter 6 - Page 2 of 19 April 2005 Environmental Health HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision administers t he Grants to Counties progra m for private well water testing. These funds are mainly used to cover the costs of nitrate and bacteria analy ses. Analy sis of water sa mples for common organic com pounds (includin g pesticides) c an also be covered by the Grants to Counties Program . Even with free well water analy sis available, many private well ow ners are hesitant or noncommittal about having their well water tested, particularly if the water looks and tastes okay . This failure to regularly (on an annual basis) test their drinking water speaks to a lack of und erstanding about p otential i mpacts of various water contam inants on h uman health. Results fro m the Iowa Community Private Well Stud y (2002) unders core the need for regular sa mpling of private wells located within communities. This project was a one-ti me sampling of 1 03 random ly selected wells in 50 Iowa incorpo rated co mmunities without public water sy stems. had num detections for and 28% had the atrazine metabolite DEA. While these wells wer e located in incorporated comm unities exclusively using wells, private drinki ng water wells locat ed in unincorporated areas may also have si milar problem s with contam inants. Establishing a statewide ba seline databas e of contam inant levels in private wells loc ated in these Iowa communities is needed. 61.1 Action Step Through 2010, continue to identif y small towns (incorp orated and un incorporated) that rely on private wells for drinking water and, for each such town, deter mine the general geological setting, whether there is an existing or form er agricultural chemical deal er site in town or near town, and whe ther there are individual sewage-disposa l system s or a municipal sewage-collection s ystem . (An Iowa Depart ment of Natural Res ources action step.) 61.2 Action Step By 2008, dev elop a plan, i ncluding estimated cos ts and tim e of com pletion, to collect sa mples for bacteri a (fecal colifor m, E. coli, and ente rococci), pesticides and nitrate analy ses from 20% to 30% of the drinking water wells in 100% of sm all to wns that rely on indivi dual pri vate drinkin g-water wells. (An Iowa Department of Natural Resources action step.) 61.3 Action Step Throug h 2010, contin ue to implement a sampling plan for bacteria, pesticides an d nitrates in small towns relying on private drinkin g-water wells. (An Iowa Department of Natural Re sources action s tep.) 61.4 Action Step By 2008, co mplete a repo rt, using lan guage that is easily understood a nd culturall y sensitive, within six m onths of com pleting the bacteria, pesticide and nitrate sa mpling plan and make recommendations for fut ure action. (An Iowa Depart ment of Natural Res ources action step.) 62 Goal S tatement Reduce to 20 % the nu mber of private drinking-water w ells testing positive for coliform bacteria. Base line: In 2003, 23% of private dri nking-wate r well s tested p ositive for coliform ba (Unive rsity of About 2 0% of Iowans obtain their drin king water fro m private wells. Other than or iginal construction s tandards, these wells ar e unregulated. Well owners m ust on their own assure that the quality of their water is adequate to protect thei r fam ily's health. According to the Center to Dis ease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the period 1999-200 0, 25 states reported a total of 39 waterborne-disease outbreaks associat ed wi th drinking water. Twenty -eight were linked to private wells or noncom munity water supplies (MMWR, Novem ber 22, 2002). University of Iowa Hygieni c Laboratory (UHL) private well testing from 1997 to 2004 showed state wide average conta mination rates of 12% and 27 % for total coliform bacteria and nitrate respectivel y. Over t he period of 1997 t o 2004 , the UHL analy zed 6 0,702 private well samples for nitrates and 67,627 private well April 2005 Chap ter 6 - Page 3 of 19 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Environm ental Health samples for total coliform bacteria (www.uhl.uiowa.edu). Grants-to-Counties data, collected in DNR' s private well tracking sy stem, shows that on average, local environm ental health progra ms are pluggin g over 2,0 w ells annually . This number is ex pected to decrease slightly over this decade as the number of abandoned wells decrea ses, th us making it more difficult to identif y existi ng abandoned wells. 62.1 Action Step By 2005 and ongoi ng thereafter, collaborate to pro vide an annual trainin g for local environm ental health officials on proper well construction and inspectio n techniques. (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health, Iowa Depart ment of Natural Res ources, and Iowa Water Well Association a ction step.) 62.2 Action Step Throug h 2010, contin ue to analy ze data available from over 100,0 00 water samples tested under the Grants-to-Counties pro gram to determ ine a b etter method of identif ying which wells or well factors are more likely to be a problem and which additional sam pling may be useful. (An Iowa Department of Natural Resources act ion step.) 62.3 Action Step By 2010, dev elop a strong cooperative effort with local environm ental health, Iowa Depart ment of Natural Res ources, Iowa Water Well Associ ation, and Iowa Department of Public Health to aggr essively pursue plugging 70,000 aband oned wells. (An Iowa Dep artment of Public Health action step.) 62.4 Action Step By 2010, enc ourage count y enviro nmental health progra ms to conduct inspections on 80% of all newly constructed pri vate wells on an ongoi ng basis throu gh ongoing ed ucational activities. (An Iowa Depart ment of Natural Resources act ion step.) 62.5 Action Step Throug h 2010, contin ue to provi de cost- share incentives for the renovation of marginal wells to i mprove the average qualit y of wells statewide, with a renovatio n goal of 250 marginal well s per y ear. ( An Iowa Dep artment of Natural Re sources actio n step.) Progress Fiscal y ear 2003: 196 wells renovated, Fiscal y ear 2004: 168 wells renovated. 63 Goal S tatement Ensure safe drinking w ater for Io wans by helping 100% of public water-suppl y systems m eet Environmental Protection Agenc y (EPA) require ments. Baseline: Public water supplies are required to me et EPA's maximum c ontaminant levels (MCLs ) to provide d rinking wate their cu stom ers. The Iowa Depa rtment of Public He alth will begin working with Iowa Department of Natural Resources in 2005 to sta rt colle cting d ata on MCL violation s. Rationale The 199 6 Safe Drinking-W ater Act Amendments established several new program s to help p ublic water suppliers ensure a long- term, healthy water supply . These included the availability of a Clean Wat er State Revo lving Fund t o provide loan for th e update and replace ment of water sy stem infra struct ure, and a Source-Water Protection Program and Implementation Strategy . A Capacity Development Program also exists to ensure that all public water sup plies have the technical, financial and managem ent resources nee ded. Also, an evaluation and protection program exists for disinfectant byproducts. These programs will be implem ented to attain the goal. 63.1 Action Step By 2010, facilitate the EPA-funded state revolving-l oan program to provide l ow-interest loans to public water sy stems for the cost of drinking-water infrastruct ure on an ongoing basis. (An Iowa Department of Pu blic Health and Iowa De partment of Natural Re sources action step.) Chap ter 6 - Page 4 of 19 April 2005 Environmental Health HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision 63.2 Action Step By 2007, assure that all community water supplies have com pleted source-water protection assessments t o identify potential sources of conta mination and assure that 50% of community water supplies have source-water protection in place. (An Iowa Depart ment of Natural Re sources action s tep.) Progress Currently, 10 0% of communit y water supplies have source-water protection assessments, while only about 5% of community systems now have a source -water protect ion plan. 63.3 Action Step By 2005 and ongoi ng thereafter, develop and im plement a capacity -developm ent strategy for publ ic water supplies to ensure that each system is via ble and that a ll new sy stems and current sy stems receiving state revolving funds develop and i mplement a capacity -devel opment program . (An Iowa Departm ent of Natural Resources act ion step.) 63.4 Action Step By 2010, con duct on going source-water assessment a nd remediation for all counties that will reduce the nitrate concentration in drinking- water sources to levels less than half the MCL as stipulated b y the U.S. Envi ronm ental Protection Agency . (An Iowa Depart ment of Natural Resources act ion step.) 63.5 Action Step By 2010, ens ure that publi c water supplies meet the new disinfectant maxi mum levels and the revised disinfection b yproduct stand ards as they becom e effective. (A n Iowa Depar tment of Natural Re sources action s tep.) 64 Goal S tatement Reduce to 10 the number of annual notifications received b y the Iow a Department of Public Health from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources on \"acute\" bacterial contamination in community water s ystems. Baseline: In 2004, the Iowa Dep artment of Public He alth received ap proximately 25 notification s. Rationale Current Iowa Department of Public Health resources ar e inadequate to respond to the increasing demand for service to the public, buildi ng offic ials, consulting engineers, and plum bers. A limited staff is available to handle the responsibi lity. A line-it em budget and plum ber positions need to be re-established to implem ent required pl umbing enforcement and consultation. Plum bing fu nding and a p lumber position were elim inated due to internal budget shifting. There is evidence of incre ased drinking- water contamination d ue to buildi ng d household plumbing. Backflow of wastewater and contam inants into potable water is g enerally considered a significant contributor to potable water quality problem s in distribution s ystems. The num ber of reported b ackflow incidents is small, but many are not rep orted or n ot recognized. Cross connections (poi nts where backflow of wastewater into dri nking water is possible) are prevalent throug hout the state because of lack of under standing and regulations. No plum bing inspection and e nforcem ent authorit y exist in m ost parts of Iowa. Outside of jurisdictions that license plum bers, there is no required plu mbing training and n o check of competency . 64.1 Action Step By July 2006, establish an environm ental specialist-plu mber position within the Iowa Department of Public Health. (An Iowa Department of Public Health action step. ) 64.2 Action Step By July 2006, revise the Iowa State Plum bing Code to adopt a 2004 edition code.

(An Iowa Department of Public Health action step.) 64.6 Action Step By 2007, exp and plum bing-code coverage to all Iowa build ings. (An Iow a Department of Public Health action step.) 65 Goal S tatement Increase to 40 % the nu mber of homes in non-incorporated areas with acce ptable wastewater treatment. Baseline: An estimated 8 0% of rural Iowa hou seholds lack accepta ble waste water tre atment. In 2003, a survey foun d that 96% of rural ho usehol ds in Clay Co unty lacked a wastewate r-treat ment system that would meet co de stan dards. Rationale Untreated wa stewat er can spread diseas e and contam inate drinking- water sources. Direct contact with hum an se wage can result in a number of wastewat cholera. As many as 100 different virus t ypes, such as hepatitis, are present in raw se wage. Parasites such as Cryptosporidium may also be present. Scientists believe hundr eds of disease-causing organism s yet to be identified may exist in sewage and waste water. Wastew ater a lso may conta in harm ful chemicals and heav y metals known to cause a vari ety of environmental and health problem s. People who have suppressed imm une systems beca use of HIV/A IDS, chronic disease, chem otherap y, or other conditions are especially at-risk fro m waste water-related diseas es. Children, the elderly , and the urban and rural poor are also significantl y more at-risk than the general popul ation. Forty -five percent of Iowa houses lack connections t o public sewers. Over 350 named communities have no public sew er sy stem . At least half of these homes d ischarge inadequately treated huma n sewage into the environm ent. Thirty seven percent of new homes are not on a public sewer. 65.1 Action Step By 2007, establish a statew ide program for on-site wastewater to prov ide and coord inate training and t echnical support for cou nty regulator y programs. By 2008 , expand the program to include resear ch on new technologies. (An Iowa Departm ent of Natural Resources act ion step.) 65.2 Action Step By 2008, establish statewide require ments for an evaluation of septic s ystem s at the time of real est ate tra nsactions. (An Iowa Depar tment of Natural Re sources actio n step.) 65.3 Action Step By 2005, dev elop required training and certification for count y sanitarians on th e design and inspection of residential septic sy stems. (An Iowa Department of Natural Resources action step.) 65.4 Action Step By 2010, establish ongoing statewide management entities that design, finance, install, and m aintain on-site sewer systems for communities and rural area s where c entral sewe rs are no t financially feasible. (An Iowa Depart ment of Natural Res ources action step.) 66 Goal S tatement By 2010, re duce the number of unintentional exposures to household hazardous materials by 30%. Baseline: In 2002, the Iowa Statewide Poison Cont rol Cente r received 11,3 30 call s on h ousehol d hazardo us material s. Chap ter 6 - Page 6 of 19 April 2005 Environmental Health HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Rationale The Iowa Statewide Poison Control Ce nter (ISPCC) answers questions about tox ic substances an d provides emergency poison inform ation 24 ho urs a day, seven day s a week for all Iowans. In 2 002, the ISPCC responded to 26,482 calls o n hum an exposures to pote ntial poisons (ISP CC Annual Report, 20 02-2003). The m ost frequent callers are mothers o r day- care providers for children under five years of age. Each y ear in the Unit ed States, about one million report ed poison exposures occur in children less than five years old. Most occur in children aged two to three, accounting f or over 50% of report ed poison ex posures in the U.S. Common substances in ac cidental poisonin gs in children incl ude comm on household products, cleani ng pro ducts, personal care products, plants, and berries. Of the calls received by ISPCC in 2002, 11,330 were associat ed wi th household hazardous materials (DNR Household Hazardous Materials Program Annual Repo rt, 200 3). Toxic Cleanup Day s are vo luntar y, one-day events, for households free of charge. A designated site is prom oted and staffed as a drop-off point for disposal of small am ounts of hazardous waste (220 poun ds or 25 gallons per household). In 2003, m ore than 71, 000 pounds of hazardous materi als wer e collected at nine Iowa Depart ment of Natural Resources (IDNR) sponsored To xic Cleanup Day s. A total of 1,6 20 households participated, for an average participation rate of 2.1 pe rcent. The IDNR has educational resources on the proper handling of household hazardous materials and prov ides notices on the availability of grant funds for hosting t oxic cleanup day s on its web site, www.iowadn r.com. 66.1 Action Step By 2010, raise the awar eness of Iowans about the hea lth, safety and enviro nmental results of incorrect use or storage of household hazardous material (HHM) and their incorrect disposal b y: Maintaining s trong, ongoing household hazardous materials educati on that emphasiz es correct use, storage and disposal of HHMs. (An Iowa Dep artment of Na tural Resources act ion step.) Maintaining a strong, ongoi ng coalition of teachers, cou nty naturalist s, public officials, regional collection-center managers, and representativ es fro m minorities, special at- risk populations, immigrants, refugees, a nd other relevant organizations to present a unified HHM educational mes sage. (A n Iowa Department of Natural Resources action step.) 66.2 Action Step By 2010, provide acces s to a regional collection center or other facility for every Iowan for correct disposal of househol d hazardous wastes. (An Iowa Depart ment of Natural Re sources action s tep.) Progress By 2004, 63 counties have acce ss to a regional collection center or satellite site. 66.3 Action Step By 2010, hel p reduce injur ies fro m handling hazardous household m aterials in the trash throug h on-going collectio ns, which also helps prevent illegal dum ping. ( An Iowa Dep artment of Natural Re sources actio n step.) 66.4 Action Step By 2010, init iate a sy stem to differentiate among m inority, at-risk, i mmigrant and refugee populati ons on hazardous household m aterials exposure and establish a baseline. (An Iowa Department of Public Health action step. ) 67 Goal S tatement Eliminate blood-lead levels greater than or equal to 10 micrograms per deciliter (\u00b5g/dL) in children under six years old. Baselin e: Da ta gathere d from mand atory reporting of bl ood-l ead te sting for childre n born from Ja nuary 1, 1995, thro ugh Decemb er 31, 1997, an d tested before th e age of six shows an estimated 9.4 % of Iowa chi ldren u nder the age of six have blood-l ead leve ls of 10 micro grams per deciliter (\u00b5g/ dL) or greater. April 2005 Chap ter 6 - Page 7 of 19 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Environm ental Health Rationale Lead is a poison that affects virtually every system of the body, and it is the single most preventable childhood disease. Lead is especially harmful to the de veloping brains and nervous s ystems of children un der six years of age. At very high levels, c hildren can h ave severe brain damage or even die. Levels as low as 10 \u00b5g/dL can affect chil dren's intelligence, hearing and g rowth. This damage can be stopped if a child 's lead exposure is reduced; however, the dam age cannot be reversed. A number of studies have esti mated that a c hild's IQ will drop by one to thre e points for e very increase of 1 0 \u00b5g/dL in blood-lead level. In 2002, researchers e stimated that the average decr ease in lifeti me earnings of a child with a blood- lead level of 10 \u00b5 g/dL wo uld be at least $40,000 and that the a verage decrease for a child with a b lood-lead lev el of 20 \u00b5 g/dL would be at least $80,000. (Envir Esti mates of Morbidit y, Morality, and C osts for Lead Poisonin g, Asth ma, Cancer, and Developmental Disabilities. PJ Landrigan, DB Schechter, JM Lipton, MC F Perspectives, Vo lume 110, Num 1-728.) The rate of lead poisoni ng among Iowa children un der aged six is 9 .4%, approxi mately four tim es the national average of 2.2% . From July 19 92 to December 2003, 2 8 Iowa children had blo od-lead levels greater than or equ al to 70 \u00b5g/dL, which is considered a medical emergency and can result in brain swelling, coma and convulsions. T he highest blo od-lead level reported in Iowa was 360 \u00b5 g/dL in an 18- month-old child. The Iowa Departm ent of Public Health recommends that all childr en under aged six be tested for lead poiso ning. The Department reports the rate of bloo d-lead testing am ong children and the prevalence of lead poisoning by birth coh ort. A birth cohor t is a group of children born durin g a give n period. Thi s method is used because it is the onl y one that allows reporting of both the percentage of children tested and the percentage identified as lead-poisoned. The percentage of child ren tested has inc reased substa ntially , from 26.2% of children born in 19 91 to 57.4% of childr en born in 20 00. (No te: Data for children b orn in 2000 will not be com plete until December 31, 2006, when all children in the birth cohort have reached the a ge of six.) In Iowa, m ost case s of lead poisoning are caused by lead-based pain t. Such paint in a home becomes a lead hazar d as it deteriorates and paint chi ps end up on floors and in window wells, as well as in the soil around t he exterior. The chips also crum ble an d become part of the dust on fl oors and window troughs. Mos t of Iowa' s older homes contain lead-based paint. Young chil dren who live i n older h omes beco me lead-poisoned when the y put paint chip s or exterior soil in their m ouths or when they get house dust an d soil on their hands and p ut their hands in their mouths. Although lead-based paint was not banned until 1978, and m ost federa l regulations apply to housing built before 1978 , most cases of lead poisoning in Iowa are a ssociated with homes built before 1960. Som e homes built between 1950 and 1960 contain lead-based paint, but t he Center for Diseas e Control and Prevention (CDC) reco mmends that pre-1950 h ousing is at the greatest ri sk of having lead-based pai nt hazards. Therefore, while the Iowa Dep artment of Public Health advises people to be concerned about lead-based paint in pre-1960 housi ng, pre- 1950 housing is used for statistical analy ses. Housing data from the 2000 census show that 39.3 percent of ho using in Iowa (48 3,849 units) was built before 1950. This is substantially greater than the national average of 22.3 percent. Iowa ranks fifth am ong the states in the percentage of housin g built before 195 0 and third i n percentage of housing built before 1940 . Two o f Iowa's faster-growing co unties are the only ones with less than the national average of 22.3 percent of pre-1950 housing. 67.1 Action Step By 2007, init iate more local childhood le ad- poisonin g prevention progr ams and conti nue to support existi ng pro grams so that the y are Chap ter 6 - Page 8 of 19 April 2005 Environmental Health HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision available in all 99 counties. Additional state funds of $600,000 per year are needed to complete this step. (An Iowa Depart ment of Public Health action step.) Progress In Fiscal Year 2005, the pr ograms served 68 counties.) 67.2 Action Step By 2010, increase the per centage of Iowa children recei ving at least one blood-lead test before age six to 9 0% for both Medicai d and non-Medicaid children. ( An Iowa Dep artment of Public Health action step.) Progress Data fro m the S ystem atic T racking of Elevated Lead Levels and Remediation (STELLAR) indicate that 57.4% of Iowa children born in 2000 have received at le ast one blood-lead te st. 67.3 Action Step By July 2006, adopt a m odel regulation for lead reduction in the cases of lead-poisoned children, usin g the authorit y of the Co de of Iowa 135.105B, w hich other citi es and counti es could adopt and i ncrease to all 99 the num ber of counties that have adopted such a regulation. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health action step.) Progress In 200 3, 10 counties have such a regulation. 67.4 Action Step By 2010, increase the nu mber of hom es of lead-poisoned children wh ere remediation has been co mpleted to 1, 000 per year. (An Iowa Department of Public Health action step. ) Progress In 2003, data from STELL AR indicate t hat remediation was co mpleted in 3 00 homes of lead-poisoned children. 67.5 Action Step By 2008, dev elop a matching grant t o aid families in covering the costs of treating lead hazards in their hom es. (A n Iowa Depar tment of Public Health action step.) 67.6 Action Step By July 2007, decreas e the average ti me for venous bl ood-lead levels in children u nder aged three to drop to less than 20 \u00b5g/dL to 10 weeks. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health action step.) Progress In 2003, data from STELL AR indicate t he average ti me was 24 weeks . 67.7 Action Step By 2010, increase to 10,000 the num ber of people who h ave co mpleted an appro ved 8-ho ur course on tem porary treat ment of lead-based hazards in homes (le ad-saf e work practices training cours e). (An Iowa Department of Public Health action step.) Progress Iowa Department of Publi c Health data show that 3,3 30 peop le com pleted this course as of Dec. 31, 2 003. 68 Goal Statement Reduce deaths from prolonged exposure to radon b y 10%. Baseline: The Environme ntal Protectio n Agency e stimates that in 2005, over 200 Iowan s died from ra don- induced can cer. Rationale Radon is a naturally occurring, colorless, and odor less radioactive gas. Both National and International agencies have concluded th at radon decay produc t exposure is a known human carcinogen. The Internation al Agency for Rese arch on Cancer (IA RC), which is part of the World Health Organization, has rated radon a Group 1 carcinogen . The IARC places toxicants in Group 1 whe n they are kn own to be carcinogenic to hum ans based either on sufficient human evidence or som etimes on sufficient evidence in experi mental ani mals and strong h uman evidence. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Agenc y for Toxic Substances a nd Disease R egistry (ATSDR) and the National Toxicolog y Program (NTP) both list radon as a known human carcinogen. April 2005 Chap ter 6 - Page 9 of 19 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Environm ental Health Iowa has the highest m ean residential radon concen trations in the nation. Rad on survey s in Iowa suggest that over 50% of the homes in Iowa may have year-long rado n concentrations exceeding the U.S. EPA's action level of 4 pCi /L. In fact, radon exp osure within the state delivers over 70% of the average Iowan's effective radiation dose equivalent. Radon enters the hom e primarily through cracks or openi ngs i n the fou ndati ons of h omes. Radon can also be off-gassed fro m ground water sources during the use of water (e.g. sh owering, etc). As rado n gas undergoes radioactive decay , it releas es small bursts of energy called alpha particles that can dam age sensitive lung tissues. Lung cancer is considered m onoclonal in nature. In other words, i t is thou ght that even a single alpha particle fro m a radon decay product striki ng sensitive l ung tissue can initiate lung cancer. According to the U.S. Environm ental Protection Agency , 21,000 lu ng cancer deaths each y ear in the United States ar e the result of p rolonged exposure to residential radon have dem onstrated that a 15- year radon exposure even at the U.S. EPA action level of 4 pCi/L increases lung cancer risk b y 50% (http://www.cheec.uiowa.edu/m isc/radon.htm l). The findin gs of the Iowa stud y are supp orted b y pooled residential radon st udies performed in both Nort h America and Europe/China t hat found increased lung cancer risk with pr olonged radon exposu re even below the U.S. EPA's action level. The findin gs of the residential radon studies suggest that o ver 200 I owans die each y ear from radon-induced lung cancer. 68.1 Action Step Beginning i n 2005, release publications a nd news releases periodicall y throughout the year stressing the need for residential, workplace, and school radon testing. (An I owa Department of Public Health, Iowa Air Coalition, and University of Iowa action step.) 68.2 Action Step Beginning i n 2005 , provide a minimum of two educational program s on radon annually for radon testing and m itigation professionals and two for pu blic health, real estate, or building professionals. (An Iowa Depart ment of Public Health, Iowa Air Coalition, and University of Iowa action step.) 68.3 Action Step Beginning i n 2006, initiate radon m itigation system inspec tion activities by local governm ental agencies acting as agents under contract with the Iowa Dep artment of Public Health. Iowa Depart ment of Public Health officials and Iowa Air Coal ition m embers will provide traini ng for t he inspectors. (An Iowa Department of Public Health and Iowa Air Coalition action step.) 68.4 Action Step Beginning i n 2006, initiate bi-yearly double-bli nd testing of co mmercially available radon detectors (charcoal and alpha-track) to assess the ac curacy and precision of detectors sold in Iowa. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health and University of Iowa action step.) 68.5 Action Step Beginning i n 2007 , require that all schools perform radon testing to determ ine the potential for s tudent and te acher exposure. (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health and Indoor Air Coalition action step.) 68.6 Action Step Beginning i n 2007 , require radon testing as part of all real est ate tran sactions. (An Iowa Department of Public H ealth and Department of Commerce a ction step.) 68.7 Action Step Prior to 2 009, prom ote rad on resistant new construction ( RRNC) at the local level. (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health and Indoor Air Coalition action step.) 69 Goal S tatement Reduce deaths from unintentional non- fire carbon monoxide (CO) poison ings from 0.70 per 100,000 (20.3 deaths per year) to zero. Reduce CO exposu res and subsequent health problems. Baseline: Chap ter 6 - Page 10 of 1 9 April 2005 Environmental Health HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision From 1 979 th rough 198 8, 203 Iowan s died from carbon m onoxide inhalatio n, accordi ng to an article in the Journal of the American M edical Association by Nathaniel Cobb, M.D. an d Ruth Etzel, M.D., PhD. In 1997, a singl e utility reported findi ng 1,327 structure s with more than 20 part s per million of ca rbon mon oxide. Carbon m onoxide poisonin g became a reportable condition un der Iowa Admini strative Code Chapter 1 \"Notific ation and Communi s Disea ses, Poisoni ngs, and Conditions\" in 2001. The Iowa Departme nt of Public Health i s collecting mo re recent baseline data o n carbon monoxide p oisonings and death s. Rationale Almost 5,000 people are injured each y ear from unintentional carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning at a residential-s ocietal cost of over one billion dollars annually, according to the U.S. Depart ment of Health and Human Services in 19 98. Car bon m onoxid e is the leading cause of poiso ning deaths in the United States, accounting for 3,500 to 4,000 annual fat alities. Each y ear, an estim ated 10, 000 people either lose a day 's work or seek medical attenti on because of carbon m onoxi de poisoni ng. Approxim ately two-thirds of fatalities occur during a fire. Most of the r emainder result from exposure to p roducts of incomplete co mbustion. Appliances that are out-of-adjust ment, rusty, defective, and/or n ot venti ng correctly can produce hig h concentrations of carbon monoxi de that can spill into occupied areas. Carbon monoxide exposure, death and disease data are not s ystematically collected in Iowa. C arbon monoxide is an insidious poison. It is c olorless, odorless, tasteless, and non-irritating. Intoxication c auses confusi on, m emory loss, and irrational thinking, m aking it difficult for victims to recognize they are bein g poisoned. From 30% to 100% of carbon m onoxide cases are initi ally misdiagnosed, according to two articles, t he first in the Journal of Emergenc y Medicine in 1999, the second in Annals of Emergency Medicine in 198 7. The effects are many and can mimic other disease s. Carbon m onoxide poiso ning is difficult t o diagnose and, until recen tly, the only way to determ ine CO levels in the blood was t hrough a blood test. However, federal approval h as recently been given for the use of CO breath analy sis equipment, making screening sim ple, rapid, inexpe nsive, and n on-intrusive. Linn Count y hospi tals used this equipm ent in survey s in 19 97-1998. Routine use of CO breath analy zers would decrease t he num ber of misdiagnosis. 69.1 Action Step Beginning i n 2006, release publications a nd news releases annuall y that stress the need for carbon m onoxide alarm s and yearly maintenance of heating appliances. (An Iowa Depart ment of Public Health and Iowa State University action step.) 69.2 Action Step Beginning i n 2007 , provide a minimum of two education program s on carbon m onoxide annuall y for HVAC contractors and environm ental public health professionals.

(An Iowa Department of Publi c Health and Iowa Departm ent of Public Safety action step.) 69.4 Action Step Beginning i n 2006 , cond uct annual educational p rograms on th e symptoms, screening, treat ment, surveillance, emergency response, or source investigations for medical personnel. In clude inform ation o n medical screening program s for carbon m onoxid e using breath analy zers in e mergency room s and/or in emergency medical servic es (EMS) vehicles. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health, University of Iowa, and Iowa State Uni versity action step.) 69.5 Action Step Beginning i n 2006 , provide annual warnings on the effects of carbon m onoxide ex posure from a variet y of sources (cigarette s moke, car washes, charcoal grills, warehouses, etc.) , and April 2005 Chap ter 6 - Page 11 of 1 9 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Environm ental Health coordinate with other grou ps to assist in meeting their goals. ( An Iowa Dep artment of Public Health, University of Iowa, and Iowa State University action step.) 610 Goal Statement Decrease the number of emergenc y visits for respiratory distress on da ys in which outd oor air quality is consi dered impaired using the Environmental Protection Agenc y's Air Quality Index. Baselin e: See Ration ale. Rationale Drinking an d using water is a conscious decision. We notice lakes and strea ms, but we are constantly looki ng through air and ar e immersed in it. We live at the bottom of an \"ocean\" of air tens of thousands of feet deep. Air has weig ht and m oves and behaves like a fluid ( www.i owadnr.com ). But unlike w ater, we consume air automatically , continuousl y and without choosing whe n or where. Adults breathe about 20,000 tim es daily, with an average volume intake of 15,000 liters. Athletes may consu me 30,000 liters of air. B y com parison, most people drink a few liters of water daily (www.iowad nr.com ). With their de veloping lungs and rapid breathing, chi ldren can pull in m ore pollutants per poun d of body weight t han an adult breathing the same air. On day s when air pollution is high, children are at increas ed risk. Older Iowans are also susc eptible to bad air. Because Iowa has a large proportion of e lderly residents, high qualit y air is especially vital (www.iowad nr.com ). But clean air is also i mportant for Iowa's econom y and businesses. Areas that routinel y fail to meet outdoor air standards can be federally declared in \"non- attain ment\" status under the Clean Air Act. That means stepped-up efforts must occur to reduce e missions with sometimes co stly, stringe nt control equi pment, hopefull y returning it to i ts form er clean air status. Preser ving clean air results in less regulator y oversight and o perating costs and lower health-care cost s (www.iowadnr.co m). In many areas of the U.S. where air qua lity suffers, there is increas ed regulation and there are efforts to clean the air f or consum ers, industr y, businesses, and vehicle owners. Maintaining c lean air and reducing em issions is a daily challe nge. And i n Iowa, we drive more miles every year, electri cal demand is rising, and people are using and co nsuming m ore goods. To m aintain and im prove air qualit y, emission reductions must keep pace, too (www.iowad nr.com ). 610.1 Action Step Through 2010, continue the state' s curre nt administrative program of controlling air polluti on through perm its regulating the emission of criteria pollutants and of 1 88 hazardous air pollutants. This will enforce set emission lim its, monitor am bient air, and implem ent the 1990 Clean Air Act.

(An Io wa Depart ment of Natural Res ources action step.) 611 Goal Statement Establish a core state committee called the Safe and Health y Homes Committee with a spec ial focus on children, minorities and people at-risk. Baseline: See Ration ale. Rationale The Safe and Healthy Homes initiative is designed to ta ke a co mprehensive approach to environm ental health and s afety issues. In the past, environ mental issues have been handled b y depart ments or program s with little to no communication and collab oration. T hus, it has been an isolated, fragmente d process. Since Healthy Iowans 201 0 started, comm ittees have been formed to deal with these is sues. Me mbers of various de partm ents, bureaus, programs, and agencies ar e beginning to see connectio ns among progra ms and/or pro jects and beginning to collaborate. The major environm ental concerns in thi s chapter on safe and healthy hom es are: Indoor air quality , such as radon and ha waste Private water wells and sep tic tanks Accessibility to environm ental data Safe and Health y Hom es would pro vide: Education and technical as sistance on additional en vironm ental risks in and ar ound the home (holistic approach). Coordinatio n to make better use of the 8 00 to 1,000 state and local field staff with direct contact with Iowa fam ilies (collaboration).

Iowa Code 364.17 require s communities with a popula tion of at least 15,000 t o adopt rental housing regulations. These co mmunities have 166, 989 units of renta l housin g, wh ich represent about 50% of t he rental housing in Iowa. Co mmunities have five optio ns from which to cho ose when adopting a rental housing regulation, or communities can adopt a r ental housing regul ation that is as protective as the listed codes. This section of the Iowa Code was last changed in 19 83. Two of the five o ptions for codes no l onger exist. The other thr ee have changed substantially , but Iowa law does not require co mmunities to ado pt updated versions. The codes are not equi valent in t heir pro tection for hazards that may affect health, such as lead- based paint. No state ag ency has the authority to ensure that communities wi th a population of at least 15,000 a dopt a rental housing regul ation. The Iowa Departm ent of Public Health has received an increasing num ber of calls from residents of rental housing who are concerned about con ditions. 611.1 Action Step During 2006, establish a st ate Safe and Healthy Homes Advisory Committee ( SHHAC) with represen tatives fro m the Iowa Depa rtment of Public Health, the Iowa Department of Natural Re sources, the Iowa Depart ment of Education, th e Iowa Departm ent of Human Services, Iow a State Unive rsity Extension, University of Iowa, University of Northe rn Iowa, local health departments, minorit y or at- risk pop ulatio ns, and ot her relevant organizations. Establish th e committee during the summer o f 2006 to identify Iowa agencies that deal with environm ental health and safety risks in and a round the ho me and develop a public and co mmunity education progra m on Chap ter 6 - Page 14 of 1 9 April 2005 Environmental Health HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision safe and healt hy hom es.

Give a state agency authority to oversee the adoption of rental housing codes b y local governm ents. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health action step.) 612 Goal Statement Increase the capacity of local boards of health to take on core environmental health programs, such as water and on- site w astewater-s ystem permit programs, grants-to-counties, and nuisance conditions in all of Io wa's 99 counties. Baseli ne: See Ration ale. Rationale Many local environm ental health progra ms lack the capa city to provide all the services that fall under loc al board of he alth responsibilities for environm ental health. A lack of expertise, experience an d/or comm itment exists at the local level to evaluate, ass ess and offer solutions to environm ental health risks. Local boards of health contin ually request help in devel oping effective methods to evalu ate and handl e high- risk environm ental conditions. A 1998 I owa Department of Public Health surve y of Iowa's Local Boards of Health shows that 73% of counties are unable to provide core environm ental health coverage. A range of services, fro m none to fragmented, exist in these counties, and t hey are unable to full y handle core environm ental health issues. A more thorough a ssessment of local environm ental health progr ams is needed to make further determ inations on needs and weaknes ses. Additionally , most state agencies ar e unable to deal with the needs and requests of local boards of health. Em erging concerns and issues are also not directly addressed at the stat e or local level due to a lack of resources or knowledge. The first step in achieving the establishe d goal is to have a stat e-level person devot ed solely to providing technic al assist ance t o local boards of health and sanitarians. Technical assist ance inc ludes providing guidance on developing and m aintaining essential environm ental health progr ams and identification of advanced t raining needs and/or opport unities. Exam ples include polic y and procedures on selection of personnel, ru le making, permit program s, inspection pro cedures, and collection of fees. More than a single state- level position would be nee ded to deal with the needs of local program s. Assessments will identif y need s and support the need for additional positions. The lim ited orientation cur rently offered by the Iowa Dep artment of Public Health with the help of other state agenci es receives posi tive feedback. Evaluations indicate a need fo r formally establishing t he orientation to handle the growing needs of participants. 612.1 Action Step Beginning i n 2006 and eve ry two years thereafter, sur vey local public health and local boards of health for capacity data.

(An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health action step.) 612.5 Action Step During 2005, create a mechanism to track requests for a ssistanc e on environm ental risks for which the re is no progr am and use the data to evaluate and make dete rminations on the need for resources to cover areas not currently covered. (An Iowa Depart ment of Publi c Health action step.) 613 Goal Statement Reduce pesticide poisonings through collection and anal ysis of pesticide- poisoning reports and use of data in training programs for pesticide handlers and applicators. Baseli ne: In 2002 a nd 200 3 respe ctively, the Iowa Department of Pu blic Health received 131 a nd 204 rep orts of pesti cide exposure s. Rationale Pesticides ar e widely used to control m any different pests across Iow a. The y advance public health and allow the producti on of needed food and fiber. However, pesticide accidents can threaten health. Reports of pesticide exposures with acute poiso ning effects need to be catalogued. 613.1 Action Step During 2005, establish an electronic reporting s ystem and develop criteria for content of reports. (An Iowa Departm ent of Publ ic Health action step.) 613.2 Action Step By 2006, establish a progra m that assure s follow-up i nvestigations, studies, data assessment, trend reporting, communicat ion with outside agencies, and identification of high- risk environm ental cond itions and expos ure. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health action step.) 613.3 Action Step By 2007, dev elop a method to educate health-care providers on pesticide exposure in Iowa. (An Iowa Department of Pu blic Health action step.) 614 Goal Statement Designate a government agenc y to be a central repository of environmental data from participating entities. Baseline: See Ration ale. Rationale Environm ental polic y should be based upon the best available scientific inform ation to convince the public of t he need to cond uct human activities in a prescr ibed m anner. To make environmental data available to researchers who are condu cting evaluations, it is necessary to discover who is conducting data gathering. A network is needed to facilitate the cooperative transfer of data. The interne t has beco me the f astest and ea siest mode of communicati on. An internet site that lists basic inform ation on research co uld be a starting point to network pe ople with similar research interests. 614.1 Action Step By 2007, com plete an as sessment of the qualit y and quantity of en vironm ental health data. (An Io wa Department of Pu blic Health action step.) Chap ter 6 - Page 16 of 1 9 April 2005 Environmental Health HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision 614.2 Action Step By 2008, dev elop a standardized form and catalog the identified data (electronic or written), including ide ntifying quality assurance and/or qualit y-contr ol standards. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health action step.) 614.3 Action Step During 20 09, publicize the data-sharing network to environm ental s taff and resea rchers in the public and private sector. (An Iowa Department of Public Health action step. ) 615 Goal Statement Ensure that 100 % of sc hools, grades 1- 12, provide information on environmental health in their health curricula. Baselin e: to be esta blishe d by the Iowa Depa rtment of Public He alth, see Ration ale. Rationale A significant am ount of inf ormation is available to the public on t he six priorit y health- risk behaviors of the Centers for Disea se Control and Prevention. The y are: Physical activity; Dietary behaviors; Behaviors that result in inte ntional and unintenti onal injuries; Sexual behaviors that result HIV infection, oth er STDs, and unintenti onal pregnancies; Alcohol and other drug use; and Tobacco use. These behaviors are also e mphasized in school-health curricula. Far less infor mation is available to the public o n improving b y reducing exposure to e nvironm ental hazards. Iowa Administrative Code 281, Chapter 12 say s health is a required com ponent of the cur riculum for children in K-12. This chapter also states that health instruction for children in gr ades 1 throug h 12 shall include environm ental health. It is not know n how m any Iowa schools address environm ental health in the ir health curricula or the extent to which it is addressed. Age - appropriate u nits on env ironmental health are available from sources m and www.toucane d.com . Also, environm ental health professionals are resource s teachers could use to supplement standard curricula just as school nurses and other health professionals ar e used as resources for other health subjects. The best way to address the environmental health education needs of the po pulation is b y starting with school-age children who are alread y required by law to receive i nstruction in environm ental health. 615.1 Action Step By 2008, collaborate with the Iowa Department of Education a nd the Iowa Association for Health, Phy sical Education, Recreation and Dance (IAHPERD) to determ ine how many Iowa schools include environ mental health in their health curricula and the extent to which it is in cluded. (An I owa Department of Public Health and University of Norther n Iowa action step.) 615.2 Action Step By 2010, collaborate with the Iowa Department of Education a nd the Iowa Association for Health, Phy sical Education, Recreation and Dance (IAHPERD) to determ ine the best way to ensure that Iowa schools include relevant environm ental health inform ation in their health curricula. (An Iowa Depart ment of Public Health and University of Iowa action step.) 616 Goal Statement The Io wa Department of Public Health and the Io wa Departme nt of Natural Resources w ill issue j oint fish consumption advisories wherever it is confirmed that contaminant standards have been exceeded. Baselin e: See Ration ale. Rationale There is much concern nationwide about the levels of mercury in fish a nd the potenti al health effects of con suming fish. The U.S. Food and Drug Adm inistration and t he Enviro nmental April 2005 Chap ter 6 - Page 17 of 1 9 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Environmental Health Chapter 6 - Page 18 of 19 April 2005 Protection Agency issued a joint statement in 2004 on fish consumption, recommending limits for those in high-risk populations (e.g., women who may become pregnant, pregnant women, nursing mothers, and young children). The Iowa Department of Public Health and the Iowa Department of Natural Resources are working closely to monitor fish-tissue sampling for mercury and other contaminants statewide (e.g., PCBs, Chlordane). The Iowa Department of Natural Resources issues fish-consumption advisories wherever it is confirmed that U.S. Food and Drug Administration standards have been exceeded. Language and culture sensitive educational materials ha ve been developed and posted on each agency's web site. 616.1 Action Step By July 2005, make culture and language sensitive educational pamphlets on fish consumption available at locations where people buy fishing licenses. (Iowa Department of Public Health and Iowa Department of Natural Resources action step.) 616.2 Action Step By July 2005, conduct an assessment of Iowa's fish-tissue sampling to determine if expanded sampling is necessary.

The in- tended pregn ancy percentage has rem ained sta- ble at 64% from 2000 to 2003. Adolescent pregnancies am ong females aged 15-17 have decreased from 26 per 1,00 0 fem ales in 2000 to 21.6 i n 2003. For females 12-14 years t he num - ber of pregna ncies has dec reased fro m 91 in 2000 to 67 in 2003 . At the time the Healthy Iowans 2010 pr oc- ess began, the Iowa Youth Risk Behavior Sur- vey (YRBS) provided weighted data th at could be generalized to the wh ole Iowa popul ation of youth in grad es 9-12. Sinc e then the school par- ticipation in t he survey has decreas ed. Now the data, while valid for the youth that take t he sur- vey, cannot b e generalized to the whole I owa populati on of youth grades 9-12. As a result, there are no valid data available currently to monitor the sexual behavior of Iowa adolescents. Data fro m the Fam ily Planning Council of Iowa and the Iowa Department of Publi c Health are available for m onitoring contraceptive use among clients of the p ublic family planni ng clin- ics. However, we have not yet found a way to obtain data on contraceptive use from the private health sector. Before we can increase male involvem ent in pregnanc y prevention and family planni ng we must first have a baseline fr om which to mea s- ure im provement. This will require obt aining data fro m the Fam ily Planning Council of Iowa, the Iowa Dep artment of Public Health family planning program, the Fam ily Plannin g Council of Iowa speci al male initiat ive, the Iowa De- partment of Hu man Services co mmunity adoles- cent pregnancy preventio n program , and the Iowa Depart ment of Public Health absti nence education pro gram. After much thoug ht, the c hapter team de- cided that we are unable to obtain data about t he sexual activity of persons a ged 18-2 4. We might be able to obt ain some data about person s in col- lege, but ther e is no way to obtain i nformation about the larg e num ber of persons who d o not attend school in that age gr oup. The team will continue to direct outreach and educational in- formation to persons aged 18-24, but will eli mi- nate the goal regarding sexual activity for per- sons in this a ge group . In the last few y ears, there has been a sig- nificant increase in funding for abstinence edu- cation progra ms. This has resulted in an in- crease in the types of pro grams developed and offered relate d to adolescent pregnanc y preven- tion. Concern has been raised both at the na- tional and state levels about the content and qualit y of m any of the new program s. The Food an d Drug Safety chapter team de- cided that ma king em ergen cy contraception available from pharmacies without t he need for a prescription was not consistent with the direc- tion of their chapter. The y suggested that e mer- gency contraception falls within the fam ily planning chapter. Goal Statements & Action Steps 71 Goal S tatement Increase to 65 % the proportion of in- tended pregnancies among Io wa women aged 13 to 44. Baseli ne, 2003: 64%. April 2005 Chap ter 7 Page 1 of 7 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Family Planning Rationale The original goal was based on t he uni n- tended pregn ancy percentage calculation in 1999 , which was 42% or 58% of intend cy 36% or 64% of inten ded pregnanc ies. Thirt y six percent has been consistent for the years 200 0-2003. It would appear that the calculation for this indica- tor is different from the cal culation in 1999. The Bureau of Health Stati stics had not re- ported pregna ncy data except for occasional special report s requested by the fam ily planning program . As a result, the calculation for preg- nancy data was not standardized. As a result of the Healthy Iowans 2010 r equest for pregnanc y data, the Iowa Department of Public He alth's Bureau of He alth Statistics has standardized this calculation and data for this indicator, the refore, should be easier to use for determ ining intended and uni ntend ed pregnanc y percentages from now on. Using the present calculation, there has not been any change in the percentage of in- tended pregn ancies fro m 2000 t o 2003. Conse- quentl y, the team decided to change the goal. In light of the stable percentage of intende d preg- nancies fro m 2000 to 2003, the change in the goal is to increase the inten ded pregnanc ies in Iowa by onl y one percent, to 65% , for 2010. 71.1 Action Step By 2010, incr ease the funding available for clinical fa mily planning services by agencies and organizations that wor k together to identify needs and determ ine funding level. (An Iowa Department of Public H ealth and Iowa Depart- ment of Hu man Services a ction step.) 71.2 Action Step By 2010, m aintain Medicaid eligibilit y for postpartum women for family planni ng from the current 60 da ys to one year and pro vide Medi- caid eligibilit y for all women aged 13-44 whose income is at or below 200 % of povert y.

(An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health and Fam ily Planni ng Cou ncil of Iowa action step.) 72 Goal S tatement Reduce pregnancies to 12 per 1,000 among females aged 15 to 17 and to 50 total among females aged 12 to 14. Base- line, 2003: 26 per 1,000 fo r aged 15 -17 and 67 total for aged 12-14.. Chap ter 7 Page 2 of 7 April 2005 Family Planning Healthy Iowans 2010 Mid-Course Revision Rationale This goal had two indicator s to reduce preg- nancies am ong 15-1 7 year olds and to reduce pregnancies am ong 12-14 year olds. The origi- nal goal for 1 5-17 year ol ds was a 5 % reduction. However, no baseline fro m which to calculate the reduction existed. In 2 000, t he preg nancy rate for 15-17 year olds was 18.0. In 2003, the same rate w as 14.9. This indicator shows i m- provem ent an d the new ind icator reduces it more, to 12 p er 1,000. The second p art of the orig inal goal was to eliminate pregnancies am ong 12-14 year olds. This, unfort unately , is not realistic. There were 91 pregnanci es am ong12-14 year olds i n 2000 and 67 i n 2003. This show s improvem ent as well. The new indicator reduces the num ber to 50 pregnanci es. 72.1 Action Step By 2005, obtain pregnancy data from the Iowa Department of Publi c Health, Bureau of Health Statist ics using the aggregate age s in the 72 goal statem ent. (An Iowa Department of Public Health action step.) 72.2 Action Step By 2007, dete rmine the proportion of sex u- ally active males and females under age 18 who use dual contraception that effectively prevents pregnanc y and prov ides a barrier against STDs. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health, Fam ily Planning Co uncil of Iowa, and clinics action step.) 72.3 Action Step Throug h 2010, contin ue to prom ote cultur- ally com petent education and education for dis- abled youth, including special education groups and in p ublic and private schools, abo ut the so- cial and psy chological hea lth benefits of post- ponin g early sexual activity and preg nancy pre- vention.

(An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health, Fam ily Plannin g Council of I owa, and interested par ties action ste p.) Goal 73 Statement Establish a baseline of sexual activity for Iowa adole scents. Rationale At the beginn ing of t he mid-course revision process, the tea m believed that the data from the 2001 and 2 003 Iowa Youth Risk Behavior Sur- vey (YRBS) could be appl ied to all Iow a stu- dents in grades 9-12. Recently, however, we learned that the proport ion of Iowa schools par- ticipating in t he YRBS is not a large enough percentage for the results to be applied t o all Iowa students. That leaves us with no valid data about sexual activity among Iowa students in grades 9-12. In order to address sexual a ctivity April 2005 Chap ter 7 Page 3 of 7 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Family Planning among Iowa adolescents we must have accurate data on which to build goals. 73.1 Action Step Throug h 2010, supp ort the Iowa Department of Education in prom oting school participation in the YRBS for the 2005 s urvey. (An I owa De- partm ent of Public Health and Iowa Departm ent of Education action step.) 73.2 Action Step By 2006, dev elop a strategy for encoura ging parents to allow their adolescent childre n to par- ticipate in the YRBS. (An Iowa Depart ment of Education action step.) 73.3 Action Step By 2006, req uest inclusion of questions from the YRBS about adolescent sexuality in t he Iowa y outh s urvey that is administered by the Iowa Department of Publi c Health. (An Iowa Department of Public Health action step. ) 74 Goal S tatement Obtain data regarding the proportion of females aged 15-44 at risk of unintended pregnanc y who use co ntraception. Base- line: See Rati onale. Rationale This goal remains the sa me with the exception that the word effective is eli minated fro m the goal. Becaus e it is very difficult to define effec- tive, the team felt that we should elim inate that word from the goal. 74.1 Action Step Throug h 2010, contin ue to investigate data on the current proport ion of females aged 15-44 at risk of uni ntended pregn ancy who use contra- ception. (An Iowa Department. of Publ ic Health and Fam ily Planning Co uncil of Iowa action step.) 74.2 Action Step Throug h 2010, contin ue to investigate the family planni ng data that r ecognizes an d deals with health disparity issues. (An Iowa Depart-ment of Publi c Health and Fam ily Plann ing Council of Io wa action step.) 74.3 Action Step Through 2010, assure that questions added to data collection tools are culturally sensitive and language appropriate. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health and Iowa Department of Educa- tion action st ep.) 75 Goal S tatement Establish a baseline for male involve- ment in pregnanc y prevention and famil y planning and increase b y 1% male in- volvement in pregnancy preventio n and famil y plan ning as measured b y the in- crease in education and outreach to males. Baseline: See Ra tionale. Rationale This goal had been changed to have two tar- gets. One target is to establish a baseline for this goal so it can be measured. The other target is to increase that baseline by 1%. Increasi ng the numbers of males involved with responsibilit y for sexual activit y and preg nancy preven tion has been a fa mily planning priority for at le ast five years. The 1% increa se sh ould be realis tic. 75.1 Action Step Throug h 2010, contin ue to explore cultu rally competent means to raise awar eness of the posi- tive role males have in preg nancy preven tion, family planning, and the im portanc e of services to men.

Baseline: See Ratio nale. Rationale The num ber of program s addressing adoles- cent sexual health has grown over the l ast 20 years. The body of resear ch that can be used to influence the developm ent and content of these program s has also grown and sho uld be incorpo- rated into pre sent programs and new pro grams as they are developed. Iow a youth need to be receiving abstinence educat ion, teen pregnancy prevention, a nd sexual health education pro- gramming that is science-b ased and medically accurate. Thi s goal is designed to assure that program s are medically accurate and use sci- ence-bas ed practice s. 76.1 Action Step By 2010, enc ourage the Io wa Department of Education to require that all abstinence e duca- tion, teen pre gnanc y preve ntion progra ms, and adolescent se xual health programs provided in Iowa public schools are medically accurate and science-ba sed according to the CDC stan dards.

These concerns are shaped by con- sumer interests, the opini ons and action s of pri- vate purve yors of foods an d/or p harmaceuticals, and governm ent oversight. Of necessity , the federal government as- sumes a major role in the s urveillance, resear ch, regulation, and enforce ment of these products that are, for the m ost part, produced and distrib- uted for inter state co mmerce. Some state agencies, such a s the Iowa De - partm ent of Inspections and Appeals (IDIA), the Iowa Department of Agriculture and L and Stew- ardship (IDALS), and the I owa Department of Public Health (IDPH), have co mplementary roles and adh ere to U.S. Departm ent of Agricul- ture (USDA) and Foo d and Drug Adm inistration (FDA) standa rds. This chapter focuses on point-of-use, or consum ption, where Iowa consumers have an expectation that foods will be safe and nutritious and m edications safe and effective. Risk of infectious food-borne disease is i n- fluenced by changes in diet and food pre para- tion. The risks are fro m microbes such as E. coli O157:H7 from alfalf a sprouts, increasing con- sumption of c ommercial food eaten or pr epared at hom e, and conta mination by microbes such as Salm onella from restaurant and take-out service. Risks are also from new methods of producing and distributi ng foo d that c ause infections fro m such m icrobe s as Cy clospora fro m Guat emalan raspberries, n ew or food- borne agents such as Listeria monocy togenes from hot dogs, and Hepatitis A fro m green on- ions. Risks are al so from the incr ease in the amount of fo od im ported into the Unite d States from countries with less str ingent food s afety regulations and from the growing num ber of people already at high risk, especially the elderly and imm uno-suppressed. This chapter plan expands oversight thr ough close monitoring of key food-borne diseases such as Sal monella, Ca mpylobacter, E. coli O157:H7, an d Listeria. Generally , major out- breaks are e asily recognizable. Improved surveillance, including expanded laboratory testing, is proposed to address the fundam ental need to recognize sporadic and less frequent case s that re main largely unreported but are costly in school and wo rk absenteeism and personal discom fort. Becaus e the majority of outbreaks reported are fro m food consum ed away from home, im - proved m onitoring is plan ned for retail food ser- vice to ensure that \"hazard analy sis critical con- trol point\" (H ACCP) principles are used. It also reflects the most current food code standards, includin g certification of managem ent. Since foods p repared at home also carry risk, the plan proposes a sa mple survey to asses s home handling and coo king, as well as annual targeted consumer educati on that is sensitive to the needs of special popula tions. As previously m entioned, drugs are regu- lated by the FDA for safety and efficacy . How- ever, the state has a major role in ensuring proper use thr ough screening for adverse drug reactions (A DRs) at the ti me of drug dispensing. Another safety m ethod includes thorou gh patient couns eling on proper drug use and inter- action with ot her medicatio n, diet or herbal sup- plements and their effect on current m edical conditions.

Prescription medications obtained in this manner reduce the abilit y of pharmacists to identify po- tential adverse drug reactions and pro vide pa- tient education to ensure that the medications are used properl y. It should be noted that Iow a continues to have an increasingly larger elderly population and other populations with increased vulnerabil- ity to fo od-borne infections and adverse drug reactions. Goal state ments and action steps ai m to ensure the safety of food and drugs used by all Iowans. Progress Although the target num ber of 2010 cases in goal 81 has not been m et, slight reducti ons in case r ates oc curred for each of the bacte rial pathogens for which data is routinel y collected. Iowa rates, h owever, still exceed national rates of illness for both Salm onella and E. coli 0157:H7 . The Iowa Food Safety Task F orce was formed and has spons ored retail and con- sumer food safety activities. The task force, in collaboration with represen tatives fro m industr y and other state agencies, is still determ ining the feasibility of developing an integrated f ood safety network in Iowa. Deter mining progress on goal 8 2 has been hindered b y lack of baseline data. The Iowa Department of Inspections and Appeals (IDIA) began obtaini ng baseline d ata through develop- ment of a database to track food-borne il lness risk factors. It will invol ve a pilot period, after which it will be im plement ed statewide. The IDIA received three FTEs and sufficient fundi ng to im plement the 199 7 foo d code in the 1 6 coun- ties under its imm ediate jurisdiction un der action step 82.2. However, a need still exists to en- sure sufficien t resources to i mplement it in the remaining 83 counties. Figure 1.

From 1983 to 2002, 162 outbrea ks occurred in Iowa, for an av erage o f 8 per y ear. A total of 7,200 Iowans w ere estimated to have become ill as a result. Figure 2.

Norov irus is sus- pected to be the cause in 37% of food-borne ill ness in Iowa between 1983 and 2003 , followed by Salmonell a (17% ) and Staphylococcu s aureus (9% ). The cause could not be confirmed i n 10% of the food- borne ill ness outbre aks dur ing the period. Though norov irus i s sus- pected to be a lea ding cause o f food- borne illn ess, i t is difficul t to prevent becau se illness can be caused with a low infectio us dose. The pathogen also is environmentally stab le and is transmitted in many ways. Chap ter 8 Page 2 of 11 April 2005 Food & Drug Safety HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Legislative bills were proposed to increase licensing fees for regulated facilities to meet fundin g short falls and prov ide m oney for im- plem enting th e food code i n all counties. No progress has been made toward establis hing re- quirements on food safety education fro m action step 82.3. I mproper hand washing was added to the thir d risk factor identified in the ta ble. The previous statement of poor personal hygiene lacked an explicit statemen t on im proper hand washing, which contribute s to a significant number of cases of food-borne illness annuall y. Figure 4.

Goal 82 was revised to reflect a more read- ily available measure of food-bor ne illness asso- ciated with retail food establishments. There is no means of deter mining progress toward achieving t he 83 goal. Action steps 83.1 and 83.2 aim ed at obtainin g baseline data on consu mer practices and a com prehensive plan to reach consumers ha ve not been a ccom- plished. Action step 8 3.1 was rem oved in this revision due to the inability to establish a base- line. Action step 83.2 was changed to reflect a more achievable goal targeted at Iowa consum - ers. Goal stat ement 83 was modified to a measurable goal, while the original goal state- ment was inc orporated into the rationale. For goal 8-4, progress was made toward identify ing 90% of the causes of diseas e. Identi- fication of the agent invol ved increased 19% to 70% for 4 7 major food-b orne out breaks be- tween 2000 a nd 2003. The University Hygienic Laborator y (UHL) co mpleted action step 8 4.1 throug h a sur vey in Januar y 2001; there fore, that step is deleted. The \"survey of laboratory practices for i so- lation, referral and case rep orting\" was delivered to 11 0 laborat ories and clinics, with 48 r espond- ing. The step to surve y clinical laboratories wa s completed, althoug h not by its projected date. Action step 8 4.2 was not co mpleted as outlined in Healthy Io wans 201 0. Establish ment of the Center for Diseas e Control and Prevention (CDC) Cooperative Agreement and the funds it provided allowed developm ent of education m a- terials for cli nical laboratories state wide. It is aimed at incr eased spe cimen subm ission and expanded testing. Also, t he CDC agreement provided funds that allowed local publ ic health agencies to develop im provem ent plans for the reportable disease surveillance sy stem . Imple- mentation of these plans will strengthen the statewide r eportable disease surveillance sy stem . Action step 8 4.3 was not co mpleted as out- lined in Healt hy Iowans 20 10. The \"Epidem iol- ogy of Food-borne Diseases\" poster, which will be based on CDC' s \"Diag nosis and Manage ment of Foodborne Illness: A Primer for Phy sicians\" materials, will be develope d and distrib uted throug h mass mailings. Th e Iowa Departm ent of Public Health' s Center for Acute Dise ase Epidem iology is revising t he \"Reportable Dis- ease\" poster, which outline s the manner in which disease s are to be re ported. Upon com pletion, t his doc ument will be made available to health care providers and other disease reporting sources. Action step 84.6 was added because CDC' s Expanding Laborator y Capacity grant provided funding to continue and enhance the m olecular fingerprint- ing capabilit y of food-borne pathogens. These funds also allowed University H ygienic Labora- tory to increase testing of stools for Shiga-toxin producin g E.coli (015 7 and non 0157). None of the action steps in goal 85 hav e been co mpleted. This goal state ment and action steps will not be included i n the m id-course re- vision of Healthy Iowans 2 010. Lack of con- sumer access to irradiated foods and t he abilit y to im plement food-borne ill ness control meas- ures through proper cooki ng influenced t he abil- ity to develop a market demand for the product. Barriers exist on cost, im plem entation and p ub- lic perception of irradiated foods. Also, a num - ber of com panies once doi ng foo d irradi ation April 2005 Chap ter 8 Page 3 of 11 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Food & Drug Safety have gone out of business, resulting in a lack of access to such technology . As a result, the bene- fits of food irradiation for i mproving foo d safety and extending shelf life have y et to be realized. As additional inform ation and studies b ecome available on the safety and application of this technolog y to alter public p erception, its inclu- sion in fut ure revisions sho uld be re-examined. Goal 86, action step 8 6.1 was not m et due to the im pract icality of sur veying all licensed pharmacie s in Iowa on their capacity to employ these sy stems. This was due to state budget cuts and subsequent decrease in the num ber of Iowa Board of Pha rmacy Exam iners (IBPE) investiga- sugge sted to replace hu man activit y and professional judg- ment in all instances, but rather supplement it. Often professionals either beco me too reliant on automation, o r simply discount it by overriding it with hum an capabilities. Changing t he lan- guage to enco urage \"a sy stem \" without - ing that it be technolog y-driven encourages hu- man intervention and im plementation of sy stems that work for the people in volved. Action step 8 6.2 was attem pted b y the Iowa Board of Phar macy Examiners, but has not yet been established. Wor k will continue to move forward with this action step. Action step 8 6.3 was revi sed since it w as not feasible to know if 90% of patients receive inform ation conform ing to the Om nibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA-90) and Iowa phar macy laws. It is feasible, however, to continue to e ducate phar macists and phy sicians on their role i n inform ing and educating patients appropriatel y about their medications and help- ing patients u nderstand the inform ation. Under action step 8 6.4, th e Iowa Board of Pharmacy Examiners perfo rmed spot checks for a period to deter mine whet her pharmaci sts wer e meeting the requirem ents of OBRA-90. This was an educa tion and disciplinary process. It has beco me even m ore important to document errors in the medication dispensing proc ess, as well as to deter mine the ca uses and reduce the numbers of errors. A plan exists to file legisla- tion to allow docum entatio n, without fear of punishm ent, of potential a nd real errors in order to im plement changes to decreas e the err ors. Action step 8 6.5 was accom plished by 2005 . The Io wa Board of Pharm acy Exam iners will continue to seek allowable legislation on a year-to-y ear basis. In action step 8 6.6, pharmaci sts we re en- couraged to c omplete continuing education o n their pharm acy practice. Since a require ment for every pharma cist to com plete these progra ms would n ot be useful, this step was replaced with an action step notin g that d rug pro duct s afety is compromised when prescri ption m edicat ions are obtained outside the traditional health care sy s- tem, such as t hrough the Internet and from sources outside the United States. The pedigree of these medications cannot be traced; therefore, people are no t guaranteed that the prod ucts they buy are those they were pre scribed. Drug use safety is also co mpromised because ther e is no prescriber or pharmacist in teraction to ensure that the m edication is correct. Action step 8 6.7 was also deleted beca use its essenc e is incorporated into the activities of 86.1 and 86.3. Action step 86.8 was deleted because it wa s not directly related to drug- product or dr ug-use safety . The sam e is true for action steps 8 6.9 and 86.10.

Chap ter 8 Page 4 of 11 April 2005 Food & Drug Safety HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Rationale Food-b orne infections have beco me an im- portant public challenge in Iowa. Salmo- nella, Ca mpylobacter and Escherichia c oli 0157:H7 are of the fo ur most im portant food-b orne p athogens in t he United States and in Iowa. The data are based o n the num ber of re- ported cases i n the state surveillance program . Listeria, the fourth m icroorganism , is less fre- quent b ut has a high death r ate. Salmonella incidence has r emained rel a- tively static, going from 13.4 cases per 100,000 in 19 98 to 16.0 in 2002 and 13.3 in 2003. Cam - pylobacter incidence has decre ased slig htly, from 16.0 cases per 100,00 0 in 1 991 to 14.5 in 2002 and 1 5.6 in 2003. E. coli 015 7:H7 inci- dence has increased slightly, from 3.3 cases per 100,000 i n 1998 to 3.8 in 2002. It decreased to 3.3 in 2003. In 200 3, the Iowa Department of Publ ic Health reported 11 m ajor food-borne ill ness out- breaks in Iowa affecting approxim ately 750 people. Food-borne illnesses can cause a variety of unpleasant symptoms and m ay be life- threatening, especially to those who already have serious health proble ms. Populatio ns at high-risk of complications are the elderly , the pregnant, in fants in the fi rst 28 days of life, and people with suppressed i mmune systems, including cancer patients, organ trans- plant recipients, and AIDS patients. Infants and youn g childre n are also usually more susceptible to food-borne infections than adults. Tens of m illions of cases of food-borne i ll- ness occur in the United States every year. The sources include a wide range of foods. While raw foods of anim al origin are most likely to be contam inated , consum ption of raw fruit s and vegetables produced un der unsanitar y conditi ons has been resp onsible for a number of recent out- breaks. A trend has developed toward consum ing more food pr epared outside the hom e. Reported food-borne ill ness is attributed to product ion methods or im proper f ood preparation and han- dling i n the f ood service area as well as in the home. Food-borne il lness caused by major bact erial pathogens can be reduced if suggested action steps are i mplemented. Ho wever, it will require more resourc es at stat e and local levels. Furtherm ore, this plan recognizes that the current structure for food safety in Iowa is co m- plex and m ulti-faceted. Ma ny agencies play var- ied but v ital roles in food safety , from produc- tion to consu mption. The magnitude of this fragmentatio n results in an inefficient environ- ment for advancing fo od safety in Iowa. Ac- cordingly, a proposal to establish a centralized and unified state structure i s imperative t o im- provin g the f ood safety s ystem . 81.1 Action Step By 2010, continue advocacy of the Iowa Food Safet y Task Force for adequate resources, ensure im plementation of all goals and action steps, monitor progress, evaluate outcomes, and showcas e progress. (An Iowa Depart ment of Inspections and Appeals and Iowa State Board of Health acti on step.) 81.2 Action Step Throug h 2010, use the Io wa Food Safety Task Force, with identified state agenci es and community partners, to identif y annual joint training activi ties to meet food safety ed ucation goals for retail, hom e, co mmunity , cons umer, and special populatio ns. ( An Iowa Foo d Safety Task Force a ction step.) 82 Goal S tatement Reduce b y 20% food-b orne outbreaks in retail food establishments. Baseli ne: See Ration ale. Rationale Improper hol ding tem peratures, inadequ ate cooking , poor personal h ygiene, contam inated equipm ent, and foo d from unsafe sources have caused food-borne ou tbreaks in retail fo od estab- lishments. Focusing regul atory efforts on changing behavior and pra ctices will reduce this risk. Minim izing risk will reduce the probabilit y of food- borne illness and achieve the greatest degree of consu mer protection. April 2005 Chap ter 8 Page 5 of 11 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Food & Drug Safety Measuring the reduction of the risk of food- borne illness cannot be accom plished wi thout first establish ing a baseline. Reducing risk fac- tors from determined level s is essential and will reflect progress toward decreasing food- borne illnesses resulting from retail food establi shment inspections. These effort s, as outlined in the 1997 Food Code of Iowa, l ack full im plementa- tion d ue to in sufficient funding. Therefore, in- creased fundi ng is necessar y to im prove the qualit y of ret ail food establishment inspections and enhance the state's ability to reduce f ood- borne illness. An underl ying challenge is high t urnover among usually youthful ret ail food servi ce workers. It is a work force often lacking ade- quate knowledge about f ood safety . Food-borne Illness Risk F actors* Improper h Contam inate nt Foods from un safe sources Source: CDC; FDA Retail Foodb orne Illness Risk Factor Database, 2000; 2004 However, retail food servi ce managers are usually m ore mature and can provi de th e consis- tent authorit y to ensure that food safet y is im- plem ented. Im proving the knowledge o f man- agers through specific train ing will assure greater em ployee com pliance and im prove food safety in retail businesses. 82.1 Action Step Through 2010, initiate a pi lot study to i den- tify a baseline for risks of food-borne ill ness. By 2007, im plement a st atewide co mputer track- ing s ystem to collect information by risk factor to achieve a baseline and by 2010, establish a targeted goal. (An Iowa Departm ent of Inspec- tions and Ap peals action step.) 82.2 Action Step Throug h 2010 and within two years of it s introducti on, support t he adoptio n of the most current FDA Model Foo d Code and adequate resources to e nsure its im plementation. (An Iowa Department of Inspections and Ap peals and Iowa Departm ent of Public Health action step.) 82.3 Action Step By 2007, establish a require ment that ea ch retail food establish ment have a Food Ce rtifica- tion Trainin g Program certified manager. (An Iowa Department of Inspections and Ap peals action step.) 83 Goal S tatement Provide two consumer food safety edu- cation programs annuall y. Baselin e: To be establi shed. Rationale The food-pre paring consu mer represents the last opportuni ty to assure protection against food-borne ill ness. Consumers f amiliar with food safety pr inciples can do a great deal to pro- tect the mselves and their fa milies fro m the haz- ards of food- borne illnesses within the home. Increasing the proporti on of consum ers who practice each of the seven critical food h andling behaviors b y the U.S. Departm ent of Agricul- ture, listed below, will help reduce the incidence of such illness: Wash hands before handli ng foo d; Keep food safe - refrigerate; Don't thaw food on the kit chen counter; Wash hands, utensils and surface again after contact with raw meat and poultr y; Never leave p erishable food out f or over two hours; Chap ter 8 Page 6 of 11 April 2005 Food & Drug Safety HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Thorou ghly cook raw m eat, poultr y and fish; and Freeze or refr igerate leftovers pro mptly. To quantif y this problem , consumer food handling practices must be defined and a base- line deter mined. Effective mea sures c an then be established. Increasing the proporti on of con- sumers practicing safe food handli ng wi ll result in a decrease in food-borne illnesses fro m home- prepared food. 83.1 Action Step By July 2006, identify food safety educ a- tional m aterials appropriate for the pu blic and improve access to them for all populations throug h cons umer-directed pu blic service an- nouncem ents. Make materials more available in collaboration with the Iowa Food Safet y Task Force and aca demic and community /industry partners. (An Iowa Depa rtment of Inspections and Appeals, Iowa Food Sa fety Task For ce, and Iowa Department of Publi c Health actio n step.) 84 Goal S tatement Improve surveillance of food-borne dis- eases to ensure earl y recognition and prompt rep orting to public health offi- cials so ca uses of disease are deter- mined in 90% of recog nized case s. Base- line: See Rationale. Rationale Iowa investigated 47 m ajor food-b orne o ut- breaks involving nearl y 2,000 ill persons be- tween the y ears 2000 an d 2003. The agent in- volved was deter mined in only 70% of cases due to dela yed reporting and the fact that suspected food and clini cal specimens were often not available for laboratory analy sis. The num ber of sporadic cases of food-borne illness is esti mated to be considerably more than the num ber that are recogni zed, reported and investigated. Surveillan ce is the key to disease prevention an d control. It offers an opp ortunit y for investigation of episodes, including preven- tion of continuing cases. It also provides as- sessment of time trends, including recognition of emerging problem s and evaluation of st andard safeguards. Collection of this data requires many resources and a co mmit ment to re port summary information to health care providers, citizens and public health officials. The present surveillance system is largel y passive and depends on case reports from practi- tioners. However, earlier r ecognition of cases and out breaks could be achi eved throug h ex- panded and i mproved surveillance. er de- tection could also be im proved thro ugh use of active diseas e reporting, such as routine, solic- ited inquiries, and additional laborator y evalua- fingerprinting by Pulsed- Field Gel Electrophoresis In addition, earlier detection woul d improve investig ations and help prevent m ore cases. PulseNet is a national m olecular subt yping network for f ood-borne dis ease surveillance that was initiated in 1998 in response to a large out- break of E.co li O157:H7 i n western United States. It has revolutionized food- borne disease surveillance by allowing ne ar real-ti me DNA fingerprinting of pathogenic bacteria by state and local pub lic health laboratories. They use rapid and hi ghly standardi zed PFGE protocols, enabling the rapid com parison of DNA finger- prints to a national database of fingerprint pat- terns for each food-borne bacterial pathogen. PulseNet makes rapid detection of cluster s of food-borne ill nesses possib le and provi des an early warning sy stem that will lim it outbreaks by identify ing sources of c ontamination and raising awar eness of food by the Center for Dis- ease Control and Prevention (CDC). The Uni- versity Hygienic Laboratory is a participant of PulseNet and funds from CDC's Epidemiolog y and Laboratory Capacity for Infectious Disea ses Cooperative Agreement (ELC) provide s contin- ued support to perform real-time PFGE of foodb orne pat hogenic bacteria using Puls eNet standardized protocols. Surveillance also allows earlier recognition of ind ustry-wide food co ntamination and perm its timely interve ntions to prevent additional case s. For exam ple, the CDC-dire cted FOOD NET is a nationall y-based, sentinel-surveillance sy stem in April 2005 Chap ter 8 Page 7 of 11 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Food & Drug Safety 10 states and localities that has enabled public health authori ties to recognize sporadic cases of food pr oducts having a l ow level of cont amina- ed through interstate commerce. Early recogni tion assures prom pt product recall and consum er advisories. The Presidential Food Safety Initiative of 1997 was one exam ple. It resulted in unprece- dented coope ration am ong the CDC, Food and Drug Adm inistration (FDA), and U.S. Depart- ment of Agriculture - the three federal a gencies responsible for food safety in the cou ntry. Under FDA leadership and throu gh part ner- ships with state agencies and the Retail Food Regulatory Pr ogram Standards, states have joined to identify im pediments to communica- tion and co operation. The y have also developed a seamless food safety system that transcends jurisdictional boun daries. FDA-sponsored food safety task forces have been established in m any states. Consisting of representativ es of industr y, academ ia, regulator y agencies, and consum ers, the task forces deal with various areas of feder al agency roles and responsibiliti es. They also deal with coordina- tion of outbreak response and in vestigation, data collection and inform ation sharing, comm and coo rdination. The results of these groups will be incorpo- rated into nati onal gui delin es for demiological surveillance. will faci litate rapid recognit ion, response and interventi on in the event of multi-state fo od-borne illness out- breaks. It will also facilitat e the investigation and recall of co mmercial p roducts distri buted through inters tate co mmerce. The scope of this program requires the sup- port and co operation of all levels of gov ernment, including those in Iowa. 84.1 Action Step By 2006, the University Hygienic Labor a- tory (UHL) will com plete visits to laboratories throug hout the state to educate staff on various topics, including the need for increased s ubmis- sion of specimens.

(A University Hygienic Laboratory action step.) 85 Goal S tatement Ensure the safest and most effective use of pharmaceutical products. Base line: See Ration ale. Rationale Industr y and governm ent stud y groups esti- mate that more than 50% of the 1.8 billion pre- scriptions filled annuall y in the United States are used incorrectly. Of particular concern are patients who take multiple medications that might result in adverse Chap ter 8 Page 8 of 11 April 2005 Food & Drug Safety HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision drug reactions (ADR s). The elderly , an increas- ing pr oporti on of Iowa residents, are a vulner- able populati on. Adverse drug reactions account for an esti mated 10% of all hospital admissions, increasing the costs of medical car e, and, in se- vere cas es, le ading to death. Compoundi ng this concern is the fact that during the 19 90s, the FDA approved a r ecord increase of ne w drugs and biologics, com press- ing the tim e that health care providers have to familiari ze them selves wit h proper use. The FDA also stre amlined so me of the new drug and generic drug approval and testing processes so drugs are available more quickly than they have been in past decades. Adve rse drug react ions may also result from appar ently low rates of complications either singly or in com binations that were undetectable during clinical tri als. These observations illustrate that prim ary care providers and pharmacists, in particular, need to establish protocols that use thoro ugh patient backgroun d evaluation and expanded us e of computer and surveillance technology to detect and report ad verse drug reactions. One of the Healthy Iowans 2010 goals is to ensure that proper counseling is pro vided to 80% of patients b y the year 200 6. Consumer counseling n ot only improves the qualit y of information give n to the patient, but also notes relevant inform ation useful t o medical management of the patient. Since subtle side effects of drugs, such as those with potential links to agi ng and m ale and/or female differ- ences, ar e often ignored by patients and not re- ported to t heir ph ysicians o r pharmacists, the possibilit y of excluding a negative change in therapy is lost. Additionally, im proved co mmu- nication between prescribe rs and patients may prom pt questions that coul d lead to the discov- ery of novel d rug-dru g inter actions or dru g- allergy interactions. Recognizing t he importance of counseling, the Om nibus Budget Rec onciliation Act of 1990 mandated that pharm acists counsel Medicaid patients when the y receive prescription drugs. A majority of st ates have expanded this require- ment to all patients. Current dem ographic trend s continue to re- flect an Iowa populati on that is increasin gly eld-erly, with a higher prop ortion able to li ve pro- ductive lives while being maintained on m edica- tion, o ther the rapies, and diet and lifesty le modi- fications. Thus, im proved clinical oversight is needed to evaluate com plex regi mens such as the poten- tial for adverse outcom es resulting from chang- ing health or disease states, subtle lifesty le changes, and use of other therapies. Such efforts should help assure i mproved medical care and improved pati ent outcom es. Additionall y, it should be recognized that Iowans, often from necessi ty, m ay be in multiple health care en vironm ents or may self- manage much of their care. Phar maceutical us e, over- the-counter (OTC) product use, and even alter- native medicines may interact to produc e ad- verse outco mes. This may include the us e of \"natural\" or h erbal product s. Lastly , the inabilit y to afford medication has increased, par ticularly in pe ople who lack ade- quate insurance. Many have turned to sources other than phar macies in t he United States for more afforda ble prescription m edicatio ns. The safety of the product and its use is in qu estion in these instances, and it is a public health r espon- sibility to address the problem . 85.1 Action Step By 2007, ens ure that all phar macies in I owa employ a system that identifies potential and actual advers e results and medication dispensing errors.

Over 940,000 Am ericans die of cardiovascular disease each year, which is equivalent to one death every 34 seconds (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Cardiovascular Health). Dea ths from hear t disease and stroke are only part of the picture. Alm ost one-fourth of the American popu lation lives with cardio- vascular dise ase, which re in over s ix mil- lion h ospitali zations annually. Stro ke is a lead- ing cause of disability , affecting m ore than one million Amer icans (CDC, Cardiovascular Health). Heart dise ase is also Iowa' s leading killer. In 200 3, Iowa ranked 25t h in the nation in heart- disease de aths (A merica' s Health: State Health Rankings). I n 2003, Iowa was 25th in t hat rank- ing, and 27.8% of all Iowa deaths were caused by heart disease. This percentage repres ents 7,825 people. Cerebrovascu lar diseas e (stroke) is the third leading cause of death in Iowa, resulting in 7.4% of the state' s total deaths in 2003. This percent- age equals 2,073 people (I owa Department of Public Health, Center for Health Statistics, 2003 Vital Statistics of Iowa, 2004). The statistics cited below appl y to the ge n- eral populatio n in Iowa, b ut certain at-risk po pu- lations, such as wo men and the ethnically di- verse, have increas ed risk. Heart dise ase affects African-Americans disproportionatel y. Age- adjusted m ortality rates for heart disease and stroke were each 48% high er for African - Americans th an whites in 2 001 (Iowa Depart- ment of Publi c Health, Family and Community Inform ation Tracking Sy stem [FACITS] ). 2002 Leading Causes of Death 8,173 6,4572,2211,5791,080940Heart Disease Malignant Neoplasms Cerebrovascular Disease Chronic Lower Respiratory Diseases Unintentional Injuries Influenza, Pneumonia Source: Iowa Department of Public Health Center for Health Statistics, Vital Records Before proceeding, foll owing are defini tions related to heart disease and stroke. Cardiovascular diseas e (CVD) co mprises disease s of the circulatory system , including coronar y heart disease, stro ke, congestive heart failure, high blood pressure, and other c ondi- tions. Coronar y heart disease (CHD) is a condition that reduces blood fl ow thr ough the coronary arteries to the heart muscle. Cerebrovascu lar diseas e (stroke) is a short- age of blood to the brain. Stroke classific ations include atherothrom botic brain infarction, ische mic, hem orrhagic, an d transient ische mic attack (TIA). Stroke shares several risk f actors with c oro- nary heart disease, including elevated blood pressure, high blood chole sterol/seru m triglyc- erides, inacti vity, diabetes, s moking, and a diet high i n fat an d sodium . Prevalence of m odifi- able risks, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes, increas e with a ge. Pre- vention or effective treatment of m odifiable risks can reduce or delay cardiovascular deaths. The conditio n of overweigh t/obesit y, is u su- ally a collection of m odifiable risk factors for cardiovascula r disease. These may include a April 2005 Chap ter 9 Page 1 of 10 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Heart Dise ase & Stroke high fat diet, inactivity , elevated blood pressure, elevated blood cholesterol, and diabetes. Over- weight and obesity are m easured by three fac- tors: body m ass index (BMI), waist circu mfer- and risks for disease and conditi ons asso- ciated with obesity . Adult overweight is define d as a BMI of 25 to 29.9, adult obesity as a BMI greater than or equal to 30, and adult m orbid obesity as a BMI greater than 40. BMIs at or greater than 25 are associat ed wi th increased cardiovascular disease risk. Waist circu mferences greater than 40 inches for me n and 35 inches for wo men also increase ri sk for cardiovascular diseas e. Iowa' s ominous increase in obesit y will contribute sig- nificantly to heart diseas e and stroke in the next several dec ades. The state' s obesity rate in- creased 60.0 % between 1991 and 2003. In 2003 , 61.6% of adult Iowa ns were overweight or obese (Behav ior Risk Factor Surveillance Sy s- tem, 2003). Healthy Ame rican adults over age 20 can lower their blood cho lesterol levels b y adoptin g a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet and increasing physical activity. Each 10% reduction in the populati on's average blood cholesterol level can reduce deaths from coronar y heart diseas e. In the past, the first line of defense again st coronary heart disease and stroke was tre atment, rather than prevention. However, the cost of heart diseas e and stroke in the United States is projected to have been $368 billion in 2004 (CDC, Cardi ovascular He alth), and there are a number of reco mmendations and gui delines for preventing heart diseas e and stroke for people with identified risks. Im proved detectio n of high-risk people and aggre ssive control of risks could reduce the overall rate of coronar y heart disease and stroke deaths by over 20% (Merck Manual of M edical Information-Home Edition, Section12, C hapter 139, c 1995- 2003 Merck & Co., Inc.). However, prevention an d risk reduction de- pend on self-management support - the abilit y of people, wit h heath care providers, to m anage risk and adhe re to guidelin es. In 200 2, 77.7% of Iowa's adults reported m ultiple risk factors. However, only 25. 2% were advised to be more physically active and onl y 16.6% were advised to eat fewer h igh fat or high cholesterol foods (Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance Sy stem , 2002). Therefore, im proving the detection and control of ris k, particularly high blood pressure and hig h blood cholesterol, requires im proving existing networks that pro vide screenings, refer- rals and subsequent m edical treatments 25.260.9 010203040506070 Ove rweight 1991-93 2001 -03Prevalence of Risk Factors for Heart Disease and Stroke (Adults aged 18 ye ars and older, Iowa, 1991- 1993 a nd System t of Health and Human Services, Cen ters for Disease Co ntrol and Prevention. Action steps presented in this and related chapters (including nutriti on, physical activit y and fitness, diabetes, and tobacco use pre ven- tion) recogniz e prevention as the first step to- ward reducing coronary heart diseas e and stroke deaths. Action steps are ba sed on years of re- search on cau ses and preve ntion. They also rec- ognize that most coronar y heart disease and stroke can be prevented or significantl y delay ed by implementing what is already known. Each action step is designed to al low tracking of ke y indicators to evaluate progress toward meeting the associated goal and redirection as nee ded. The strategy of reducing mean levels o f risks recognizes that most people with heart dis- ease and stroke do not have extre me risk-factor values. With behavioral modifications such as improved nut rition, i ncreased ph ysical activit y, and health care provider su pport, I owans of all ages can redu ce the incidence of risk fact ors for cardiovascula r related dise ases. Health prom otion m ust be designed to e n- sure universal acce ss to places, buildings and services for p eople with disabilities. In June 1999 , the U.S . Suprem e Court held that dis- Chap ter 9 Page 2 of 10 April 2005 Heart Disease & Stroke HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision crimination on the basis of disabilit y is illegal (Olmstead de cision). It also said people with disabilities have a right to s ervices in the m ost integrated setting appropriate to their needs. Community place ment must be considered when providing m edical devices, health screen ings, or treatment to reduce coronary heart disease or stroke deaths. This chapter focuses on the re- duction of he art diseas e and stroke, which can cause a nu mber of disabilities. The chapter was rewritten to align with the goals and obj ectives of Healthy People 2010 . Goal Statements & Action Steps 91 Goal S tatement Reduce by 13% heart disease deaths among all Iow ans.

The rate d eclined from 344.9 in 1991 to 265.8 in 2 003. Given the state's increasing pro porti on of elderl y, how- ever, the state 's death rates due to heart diseas e are on the rise. Currentl y, 15% of the p opulatio n is 65 years or older (Iowa Department of Public Health, Center for Health Statistics). Many people with signs or sy mptoms of heart attack wait too long to get help. The longer the y wait the m ore dam age occurs to the heart. Nearly half of new therapies ad ministered within one h our of o nset can stop the develop- ment of the heart atta ck. Iowans need to be edu- cated on the signs and s ymptom s, the i mpor- tance of acc essing rapid emergency care by call- ing 911, and CPR - critical skills for reducing disabilit y and death rates. Treatment is not an o ption for Iowans whose deaths are the ir first sign of coronary heart dis- ease. Nationally , 250,000 sudden deaths occur each y ear from coronary heart disease without hospitalization or previ ous histor y of heart dis- ease ( Center f or Diseas e Control and Prevention, Public Health Action Plan to Prevent Heart Dis- ease and Stroke). High-risk po pulations nee d to be target ed as well. While ethnic m inorities account f or 5% of Iowa's pop ulation (Iowa Departm ent of Public Health, Iowa Census, 2000 ) they have an in- creas ed risk of heart diseas e. In 2002, heart dis- eases wer e the leading cause of death in Iowa' s Hispanic/Latino and African-Am erican popula- tions. Iowa's population is aging rapidl y so the needs of the elderly m ust be addressed. Extra effort must also be made to reach low-inco me and rural families who often have less ac cess to health care. 91.1 Action Step By 2010, incr ease fro m 350,000 to 500,000 per y ear the n umber of people over age 16 (trained through state or nationally recognized program s) who are awar e of the early warning signs and s ymptoms of a heart attack a nd the importance of rapid emergency care b y calling 911.

Peopl e who are overweight or obese are a t increased ris k of high blood pres- sure. As the bod y mass index levels rise, so do average blood pressure and cholesterol levels. The 2003 BRFSS data show that 77.5% of people with high bl ood pressure take medica- tion. Respon dents over ag ed 65 with high bl ood pressure reported that 92.7% of treat ment is medication. The percentage of m edicated treat- ment increas es with age. There are many proven recommendations and guidelines for preventing heart disease and stroke for people with identified risks. Studies April 2005 Chap ter 9 Page 5 of 10 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Heart Dise ase & Stroke have shown that lifesty le changes can help pre- vent high blood pressure. Improved detection of high-risk people and aggre ssive control of de- tected risk fa ctors could reduce the rate of heart disease and stroke deaths. Networks tha t pro- vide screening, referrals an d treat ment must be improved for detection and control of risk fac- tors in hig h-risk pop ulation s. Education to increase knowledge of blood pressure readi ngs and their meanings, plus the role of diet, e xercise and weight control, will help people live healthier and decrease t heir risk of heart disease and stroke. 93.1 Action Step By 2010, provide pu blic education that in- cludes blood pressure scr eenings to dete ct initial high blood pressure. Initiate referral s to a health care provider, and facilitate self-management for people with histories of high blood pressure. This will increase the proportion of adul ts with high blood pressure who ta ke action (e.g., losing weight, increasing phy sical activity, or reducing sodium intake) to help control their conditions.

These in- clude m onkeypox , West Nile Virus (WNV), se- vere acute respirator y syndrome (SARS), and avian influenza. The st ate has seen incr eases in diseases such as pertussis am ong people ranging from 19 day s to 86 years of age. Given the terrorist attacks on Septem ber 11, 2001 , there h as been an increased sense of ur- gency about bioterrorism . This resulted in the training and vaccination with smallpox vaccine of 472 Iowans, with ong oing trainin g on rash surveillance, disease r ecognition, and the tech- niques of administering the vaccine. (Refer to chapter 25, Bio-em ergencies.) Major changes to this chapter include those on surve ys about rabies pos t-exposure pr ophy- laxis practices. They were deleted due t o lack of staff and money . The tuber culosis (TB) goals and objective s were changed to m ore closely align with nat ional goals. A goal was added to address influenza i mmunization rates in health care worker s. Infectious disease s are major sources of sickness and death in this c ountr y despit e predic- tions of m any experts that the public hea lth sig- nificance of infectious diseases would wane in the United States. Yet, ne w infectious agents and diseases continue to be detected, an d dis- eases conside red to be under control have re- emerged in re cent y ears. One exa mple of an emerging disease in the 1900s is the pre viousl y unrecognized hantavirus th at caused an outbreak of fatal respiratory illness in the American Southwest. This agent has now been ide ntified in more than half of the states. Iowa has had six cases of hantavirus sy ndrome since 1997. Other exam ples include contam ination o f a public water suppl y with the parasite Crypto- sporidium , resulting in the largest wat erborne outbreak in U .S. history . It also resulted in widespread outbreaks of food-borne illness due to Escherichia coli O157: H7 and a subt ype of influenza A not previously associat ed wi th hu- man illness that produced a n outbreak of disease in Hong Ko ng. Compoundi ng the pro blem is that antim - icrobial resistance is evolving rapidl y in a ety of hospita l and unity-acquired infec- tions. trends portance and potenti al volatilit y of infec- tious diseases as we begin the new century . Between 198 0 and 1 992, death fro m infec- tious diseases rose 58% in the United States. A significant pr oportio n of t his increase is due to the increasing burden of Human I mmunodefi- ciency Virus (HIV)-a ssoci ated diseas e. How- ever, even when HIV is re moved, mortality from infectious diseases still increased 22% d uring this time. Considered as a group, infectious dis- eases wer e the third leading cause of death in the United States in 1992, the most rec ent year for which final data wer e avail able and analy zed. In Iowa, the rate s for infectious disease de aths in- creased fro m 11.5 i n 1990 to 14.0 in 1995. The global context of infec tious diseases also must be considered. Increas ed international travel, im portation and m ass distribution of foods, im proper hum an an d veterinary u se of antibiotics in the U.S. and abroad, and global environm ental changes increase the pote ntial for global epide mics of infect ious diseases. That includes e merging and re-emerging diseases as well as drug-resistant strain s.

The action taken in one country can affect th e health of people gl obally. Becaus e of the i mpact of infectious disea ses on society , a coordinated strategy is nec essary to understand, detect, control, and ultim ately, pre- vent them . Such a strategy is needed to protect the gains achieved in life expectancy over the 20th Centur y, which resulted from the control and prevention of infectious diseas es. The strat- egy would als o ensure furth er improvem ents in the 21st Cent ury. Preventi on of i nfectious dis- eases will i mprove quality of life for the indi- vidual and f or society . Surveillance is needed to pr omptly recog- nize and m onitor emerging pathogens an d out- breaks. A res ponse is m ounted when surveil- lance or other data indicate a change in the inci- dence or distribution of an infectious disease, or when a new variant of a kn own pathoge n is rec- ognized. Research, surveillance and response all depend on the public health infrastructure that supports, trai ns and equips public health workers and links t hem in national and glo bal networks. The Iowa Departm ent of Public Health has added six reg ional epidem iologist p ositions. They are training local health departme nts on disease surveillance, response and reporting. Ultimately, effective prevention and control re- sult from the convergence of ong oing surveil- lance, response, applied research, infras tructure, and training. It is im portan t to m aintain or in- crease this capacity to respond t o the thr eat of emerging or re-e merging diseas es. To acco mplish the goals of controlling and preventing infectious disea ses, the Iowa plan focuses on ce rtain categories of e mergin g dis- eases and on particular groups at increased risk. Many priority areas are incl uded, in whole or in part, as 2010 objectives. Issues include antim- icrobial resistance, foodbor ne and zoon otic dis- eases, diseases transm itted through trans fusion of blood or blood products, and vaccine devel- opment and use. At-risk populations di scussed in this chapter or in other chapters include per- sons with impaired hos t defenses, pregnant women, newborns, travelers, imm igrants, and refugees. Some 2010 objectives target diseases an d pathogens tha t were unkno wn onl y 20 years ago. Others represent re-emergent problems once thought to be well controlled. These obj ectives, taken togethe r, should give our p ublic-h ealth partners, and society , a roa d map for prevention and control of many emerging and re-emerging infectious disease s over the next decade. Any such effort would be doom ed without effective part nerships and collaborations. These include federal agencies, st ate and local health departm ents, other go vernment and non - governm ental organizations, academic i nstitu- tions, professional societies, international or- ganizations, and experts in public-health infec- tious diseases and m edical microbiology. Pre- vention is effective only if society in Iowa, the U.S., and abr oad adopts th e prevention strategy . Therefore, the infectious diseas e prevention strategy in Iowa must incl ude a com prehensive group representing partner organizations that work to m ake the state a he althier place t hrough the preventio n and contr ol of em erging and re- emerging infectious disease s. Through dedi- cated work now and into t he next m illennium , this plan can be succes sful in decreasing death and sickness. One way to prevent and control disease is through vaccines. Biologic al substances that interact with the hum an immune sy stem, usually producin g an immune resp onse identical to that produced b y the natural inf ection, do not subject a person to the \"full-blown\" disease or its co m- plications. The countr y's experience with the ravagi ng effects of disease, pri marily am ong y outh, has shown that va ccines c an play a powerful role in preventing debilitating and, in som e cases, fatal effects of infe ctious disease s. In the 1950s, po- lio infected 7, 813 Iowans, r equiring t hem to need braces, crutches, whe elchairs, and iron lungs. Also, prior to vaccines most children had measles. Some survivors were left with deficits or defects ran ging from seizures to sever e men- tal retardation. During t he 1960s, m ore than 35,433 Iowan s contracted rubella, resulting in some children born with major malformations, Chap ter 1 0 Page 2 of 18 April 2005 Immunizations & Infectious Diseases HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision including deafness, blindne ss, congenital heart disease, and mental retard ation. None of these organism s have disappeare d. Rather, they have receded into the background due to the re markable eff ect that vaccines have had in preventing them . They will re-e merge if vaccination use drops. The serious heal th bur- den of vaccine-preventable disease s (VP Ds) is evident from the num ber of mea sles cases fro m 1981 to 1990, totaling over 9,517 statewide. This threat to public health has decrea sed greatly with onl y 26 cases fro m 1991 to 2000. The risk of disease bei ng re-introduced to the United States has inc reased due to international travel and populations within the countr y not a ccepting vaccination. Health car e providers are c oncerned that vaccination rates will decr ease as the public fails to see a threat , perceiving instead a risk from vaccines. The Institute of Medicine, however, has relea sed a report that conclusively dis misses the theory of thimerosal as a cause of aut ism. Vaccine s protect more than the vaccinate d person. The y also protect society . When im - munization levels in a comm unity are high, the few who can not be vaccinated (those too young for vaccination or who have legiti mate reasons to avoid immunization due to allergic reactions, etc.) are often indirectly protected becau se they are surrounded by vaccinated people (he rd im- munity ). Few public health measures match the bene- fits of vaccines. Cost-benefit analy ses have been done on vaccination of children. T wo vac- cines type b (Hib) vaccine result in substantial direct medi- cal savings for each vaccin e dollar spent. For every $1 spent on the MMR vaccine, more than $21 is saved in direct medical costs. For every $1 spent on di phtheria-tetanus- acellular pert ussis (DTaP) vaccine, more than $30 is saved. And for ever y $1 spent on polio vaccine, more that $6 is saved. The 1989-1991 measles outbreak was estimated to cost over $100 m illion in direct medical care. However, when indirect savings including preven tion of work loss by parents to care for ill childr en, pre- vention of de ath, and prev ention of l ost earnings from disabilit y are added, all the vaccines rou- tinely recommended for children are highly cost- effective. Major strateg ies for ensuring that children are protected from vaccine- preventable diseas e are: Improving Minim izing financial burd ens tion and partn ership; onitoring of diseas e and vacci- nation coverage; and Improving vaccines and vaccine use. The greatest burden of VPDs in the United States is on adults. In 2001, pneum ococcal and influenza disease accounted for m ore than 878 deaths in Iowa, mostly in the elderly . Pneum o- nia and influe nza were the sixth leading causes of death in Io wa in 2001. In Septem ber 1997 , the U.S. Departm ent of Health and Human Ser- vices approved an agenc y-wide plan to im prove adult imm unization rates and reduce dis parities among immigrant, refugee and racial and ethnic minorities. Although childhoo d imm unization rates have been historically lower in m inority popula- tions, rates for preschool children have been in- creasing at a more rapid rate, thereby signifi- cantly narrowing the gap. A report in the Octo- ber 1997 issue of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report presented findings from the Na- tional Imm unization Surve y. It d ocumented substantial progress in achieving the 1996 Childhood I mmunization Initiative coverage goals (90% immunization coverage by 2 years of age) by racial and ethnic gr oups. Curren tly, for quarter 3 of 2 002 t hrough quarter 2 of 2 003, t he national rate is 77.9% . Iow a is at 83.2% . Despite this unprecedented progress, efforts to increase va ccination coverage must be inten- sified, particularly for child ren in po verty. In Iowa, pockets of need conti nue in b oth urban and rural areas, which have substantial n umbers of under-immunized childr en. Children with disabilities ar e also at great er risk for disease and/or com plications from disease and need to April 2005 Chap ter 1 0 Page 3 of 18 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Immuni zations & Infectious Diseases be targeted to assess vaccine status and initiate vaccinations where needed . These are as are of great concern becaus e of the potential for disease outbreaks. Isolated incidences of vacc ine shortages have occurred in the last few y ears. Currently, there are only four vaccine manufacturer s. This leads to concerns about de velopm ent of new vaccines and the suppl y of current vacci nes. In 2003, an e arly influenza season and me- dia coverage led to a rush on influenza vaccine, resulting in a temporary shortage of vaccine. This tested the infrastructure for commu nication between healt h care providers in all area s of health care an d distribution to areas of need. Besides the v ery youn g, ad ults are at in- creas ed risk for many vaccine-preventable dis- eases. Although vaccination levels against pneum ococcal infections and infl uenza am ong people aged 65 years and over have increased slightly for African-A mericans and His panics, coverage in these groups rem ains well below the general popul ation and 2 010 targets of 6 0%. For exam ple, national influenza i mmuniza- tion rates for whites were 57% in 199 4, while coverage rate s for African- Americans an d His- panics were pneu mococcal i mmunization rates in the sa me year were 31% for whites, with Afri- can-American and Hispani c heria for adults are also lagging . In the last four years, Iowa has re ported two cases of tetanus each year. As adults with disabilities move fro m institutions int o the community, an infrastructure m ust exist to ensure that their needs for imm unization are met. The Immunization Registry Inform ation System (IRIS ) is a web-bas ed, statewide immu- nization registry. It enable s public and private providers to c onsolidate an d maintain a comput- erized i mmunization record for each person who receives va ccinations in Iowa. This allows for accurate tr acking of imm unizations and allows health care providers to administer vacc ine without m issing or duplicat ing doses. The IRIS was im plemented in Febru ary 2002. Cu rrently, all public health pro viders and over 2 00 private providers are enrolled. Besides the c hildhood sche dule, the Advi- sory Committee on Immunization Practic es (ACIP) has is sued an adult immunization sched- ule. In 2 004, the ACIP is reco mmending that children between 6 and 23 months of age be vaccinated an nually against influenza. It is an- ticipated that m ore vaccines will be available and placed on the appropria te immunizati on schedule. Hopefull y, this will encourage insur- ance co mpanies to cover routine vaccinations. In 200 4, Iowa isolation and quarantine laws were updated and now a llow for isolation of people with diseas es and quarantine of non- immune contacts that put the public at risk.

Chap ter 1 0 Page 4 of 18 April 2005 Immunizations & Infectious Diseases HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Rationale High imm unization coverage has proven to be highl y effective in reducing the n umber of childhood va ccine-preventable diseases to re- cord low levels. Data on the spread of diseas e and viruses show a post-immunization drop in native trans mission of such disease s. Polio has already been eliminated in the United States b y high vaccination cover age. Reported cases of diphther ia and tetanus are also near zero due to widespread use of vaccine. However, everybody m ust be vaccinated and exposure to t etanus minimized to achieve the goal of zero cases. Reported cases of pertussis will likely de- crease by increased vaccine coverage, but it will continue to occur since the organism circulates among older children and adults and the vaccine is not 10 0% effective. Given that pertussis has recently increased am ong adults, it is hoped that in the near future adu lt acellular pertussis vac- cine will be available. Once adults are no longer the reservoir for pertussis, the num ber of case s statewide sho uld decrease. Hepatitis B infection will be greatly reduced as more child ren are cover ed by universal infant and adolesce nt imm unization. Conjugate enzae ty pe B are highly effective and further reductions in disease are an ticipated. With increased use of varicella (chicken pox) vaccine, a de cline in varicella ca ses, an d subse- quent deaths, is anticipated. In 20 03, legislation was pas sed re quiring varicella vaccine for chil- dren in licensed child care centers and schools. Becaus e varic ella's rash is the m ost likel y to be confused with the smallpox rash, a decrease in varicella will lessen its con fusion with s mallpox, should it occur. 101.1 Action Step Through 2010, identify areas where substan- tial num bers of under-immunized childr en reside and develop a plan to immunize them .

Percent of I owans 65 and Olde r Immuni zed Type of Vaccine 1997 2002 stem (BRFSS), 1997, 2002 Rationale Recent feder al initiatives have highlighted the need to fo cus on imm unizing adults. Current coverage varies widely by risk group . While immunization levels for influenza and pn eumo- coccal have i ncreas ed slightly for Afric an- Americans an d Hispanics, coverage for these groups rem ains substantially below that of the general popul ation. With Iowa' s aging populat ion, increasing numbers of adults will be at risk for com plica- tions and death from pneum ococcal and influ- enza disea se. People of any age with high-risk conditions (e.g., heart disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseas e and ast hma) are at in creas ed risk, as are people in institutions. Vaccination is effective in re ducing illness and death.

(An Iowa Imm unization Coalition action step.) 103 Goal Statement Maintain levels of H. influenzae t ype b (Hib) immunization to keep the incidence of Hib meningitis among children 2 months to 5 years old at or below 0.4 cases per 100,000 population. Also, monitor vaccine and immunizatio n ad- vances, providing opportunities to re- duce pneumococcal and meningococcal meningitis among all Iow ans. Baseline: See Ration ale. Rationale Until the intr oduction of w idespread conju- gated Hib vaccine - a ty pe of vaccine that is ef- fective in children as youn g as two m onths - approxim ately 68 cases of Hib meningitis in children 2 to 5 years of age were reported annu- ally in Iowa. These cases accounted for half of all cases of bacterial meni ngitis reporte d to the Iowa Department of Publi c Health annually . With 95% of Iowa's childr en 2 m onths to 5 years of age immunized, only one case of bacte- rial meningitis due to Hib was reported from 1995 through 1997. Over the same period, 31 cases of Group B and C meningococcal meningitis occurr ed in children un der the age of six. New and im- proved m eningococcal and pneum ococcal vac- cines will likely be introduced over the next decade, providing an opportunity to significantly reduce severe disease fro m those pathoge ns. In February 2000, a seven-valent pneum ococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar) was licens ed. y Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) reco mmended the use of the va ccine in June of 20 00. Chap ter 1 0 Page 6 of 18 April 2005 Immunizations & Infectious Diseases HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision 103.1 Action Step Through 2010, assure that all public sites continue to use Hib vaccin e. When new and improved m eningococcal and pneum ococcal vaccines ar e released, ensu re they are avail- able to appro priate populat ions at those sites. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health and local health agencies action step .) Progress When new vaccines ar e rec ommended on the ACIP sch edule and available to the state on the Center for Disea se Control and Preve ntion (CDC) contract, the Iowa Department of Public Health must make the vaccine available to all Vaccine for Children (VFC) providers, along with education on an d recommendations for vaccine use. 103.2 Action Step Throug h 2010, track the in inva- sive Hib, meningococcal and pneum r eporting.

They have be en mainly extended, comm unity-wide epi demics in which by per- son-to-person contact. Between epide mics, hepatitis A continues to occur at an endemic rate. In 1998, the rate of reported hepatit is A cases in Iowa was 14.45 pe r 100,000 population. The 200 3 rate was 1.4. April 2005 Chap ter 1 0 Page 7 of 18 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Immuni zations & Infectious Diseases 104.1 Action Step By 2010, foc us on pre-exposure vaccina tion of people in high-risk groups and routine vacci- nation of children in selected areas to prevent and control hepatitis A until reco mmendations for routi ne hepatitis A vaccination of all children exist. High-ri sk groups f or which hepatitis A vaccination is reco mmende d include: Illegal drug u sers; Men who hav e sex with men; People traveling to hepatiti s A virus en- demic countries; People with an occupationa l risk of infection (e.g., people who work wit h hepatitis A-infected primates or with hepatitis A virus in a l aborator y - no other oc cupational gr oups have be en shown to be at increased risk of exposure); Children two years of age or older in com- munities with high rates of hepatitis A infection and periodic hepatitis A outbreaks; and American Indian children. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health and local health agencies actio n step.) 105 Goal Statement Reduce to zero ne wly diagnosed hepati- tis B rates in persons under aged 25. Baselin e: The average in cidence in Iowa from 1996 to 19 98 was 1.36 re ported ne w cases per 100,00 0 pop ulation. The average in cidence in Iowa from 2 001 to 2003 was 0.07. Rationale In the United States, 5% of the pop ulatio n has been infected with hepatitis B virus, and an estimated 250 ,000 t o 300,000 infections have occurred annually over the past 20 years. Al- thoug h most infections occur am ong young adults with hi gh-risk behav iors (e.g., th ose with multiple sex partners, injection drug us ers), youn g childre n have the hi ghest risk of chronic infection. It often leads to chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and live r cancer. 105.1 Action Step Throug h 2010, prom ote the Advisory Com - mittee on Imm unization Practices (ACIP) im -munization strategy for hepatitis B. (An Iowa Department of Public Health action step. ) Progress The Iowa Departm ent of Public Health fol- lows up on women of child bearing age in whom a positive hepatitis B test is reported. If such a woman is pre gnant, fam ily members ar e as- sessed for hepatitis B vaccine status and the in- fant is provided hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B imm une globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth to decrease the risk of that child de veloping the disease. Effective in the 1999 scho ol year, all chil- dren born on or after July 1, 1994, enteri ng school s ystems ar e required to have thr ee doses of hepatitis B vaccine. In 2003, the Iow a De- partm ent of Public Health started a progr am with two juvenile homes and six count y heath de- partments to provide hepatitis A vaccine to these high-risk pop ulations. 106 Goal Statement Reduce b y 50% hepatitis B among adults aged 25 and older. Baselin e: In 199 8, there were 2 re ported ca ses per 100,00 0 pop ulation. In 2003, 0.6 case s were reported in thi s popul a- tion. Rationale Implementation of routine infant vaccination will eventually produce a highl y imm une popu- lation sufficient to elim inate hepatitis B trans- mission in th e United States. However, high rates of acute hepatitis B continue to occur. Most of them are am ong young adults, i ncluding persons with a histor y of m ultiple sex partners (more than one partner in t he prior six m onths); men who have sex with men; injecting drug us- ers; incarcerated persons; and h ousehold and sexual contacts of infected people. In m ost of these groups, vaccine cover age is low. 106.1 Action Step By July 2005, implement programs targeting adolescents a nd adults in high-risk groups at sites where hepatitis B va ccination should be offered to all susceptible patients.

With more resourc es, TB is once again on the decline. The U.S. is at an all-time low in TB case s re- ported, with 10 consecutive years of decline. Iowa has had a significant decrea se as well. The commit ment of additional resources and the rebuilding of the TB inf rastructure during the mid-1990s make it reasonable to target a state rate of no m ore than 1.0 per 100, 000 by 2010 . Its achievement will depend in part on the avail- ability of continued resources and significant cooperation am ong public and private h ealth care providers and agencies at federal, st ate and local levels. However, the proport ion of TB cases in non- U.S. born people has increased sig- nificantly dur ing the past decade. In 1994, 33% of all reported TB cases were am ong non-U.S. born persons, com pared to 70% in 20 03. This populati on poses the greatest challenge to Iowa' s TB control. 108.1 Action Step By 2010, screen and evaluate all clas s B1 and B2 refugees within tw o weeks of arrival at their prim ary settlement location.

Rationale During the la st two decades, methicillin re- sistance in sta phylococci and vancom ycin- resistanc e in enterococci have been increasing. This has resulted in infections that are hard to treat with available antibiot ics. Prudent antibi- otic adm inistration and infe vanco mycin intermediate Staphy lococcus aureus (VI SA) was recognized in a num ber of health care settings. To avoid t heir joinin g the r anks of prevalent problem s, it may be desirable to prospe ctively survey for colonization and local lococcus aureus (MRSA), vanco mycin-resistant enterococci m the Emerging In fections and Epi- demiology of Iowa Organism s (EIEIO) surveil- lance in 14 Io wa hospitals showed that some 25% of the is olates of Staphy lococcus aureus are MRSA. The majority of the resist ance was in a few medical centers. The focus of surveillance for resistance in colonization and local infec- tions could center on these \"sentinel\" hos pitals.

The m easles epidem ic of 198 9 throug h 1991 dem onstrated that hi gh immuniza- tion levels at school entr y was insufficient to control vaccine-preventable diseas e outbreaks. Coverage levels are curr ently the highest ever recorded. However, the introduction of Prevnar vaccine into the childhood immunization sched- ule highli ghts the need to c ontinu ously monitor coverage and to search for gaps in coverage. 1013.1 Action Step By 2006, cha nge Adm inistrative Code 631, chapter 7, to update the imm unization require- ment for children enrolled in licensed child care and schools t o accurately reflect the recommen- dations of the Advisor y Committee on Immuni- zation Practic es (ACIP) for doses of currently required vaccine.

Baseline: See Ration ale. Rationale In 200 3, immunization cov erage of all pub- lic Vaccine for Children ( VFC) providers in Iowa was assessed. Approximately 20% of pri- Chap ter 1 0 Page 14 of 1 8 April 2005 Immunizations & Infectious Diseases HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision vate VFC providers were a lso asse ssed. With the increasing role of m anaged care and use of Health E mployer Data Infor mation Set (HEDIS) measures, private provider s should have addi- tional op portunities to hav e their imm unization coverage ass essed. Most provi ders overestimate imm unization coverage am ong their patie nts. Assessment of practice-based coverage and feedback to the providers has been an effec tive strategy for in- creasing i mmunization of at some prac- tices. Practic e-based endorsed by the Advis ory Comm ittee on Immunization Practice s (AC IP), the National Vaccine Advi- sory Committee (NV AC), the American Acad- emy of Pediatrics (AAP), a nd the Am erican Academ y of Fam ily Physicians (AAFP). 1015.1 Action Step Throug h 2010, develop collaboration a mong the Iowa Dep artment of Public Health, health care providers, and health care organizations to prom ote pract ice-based a ssessments in private provider setti ngs. (An Iow a Department of Pub- lic Health act ion step.) 1015.2 Action Step By 2010, develop a com ponent of the state immunization registry to provide p opulat ion- based, practic e-based, and geographically -based assessment data. (An Iowa Depart ment of Pub- lic Health act ion step.) Progress This process is dependent upon t he Bureau of Health Statistics in the Iowa Depart ment of Public Health com pleting its electronic birth- record sy stem. Once this sy stem is co mpleted, this action step will m ove forward. 1016 Goal Statement Increase to 75 % the proportion of chil- dren aged birth throu gh six enrolled in a fully functi of children u nder aged 5 h ad records in IRI S. Rationale State i mmunization registries will be the cornerstones of our nation's i mmunizati on sys- tem by 2010. Registries facilitate ti mely immu- nization of ch ildren b y ensuring t hat the child's complete imm unization hi story is available to the health care provider at the time of visit. The registry can facilitate meth ods for increasing immunization coverage (e.g., rem inder/r ecall systems) and feedback on practice-bas ed imm u- nization cove rage for provi ders. Registries also provide a simple means for asse ssing coverage at the geographic and p opulation levels, thus facilitating efforts to reduc e gaps in coverage among subgr oups. 1016.1 Action Step Trough 2010, market and prom ote the im- munization registry to pr ivate Vaccine for Chil- dren (VFC) providers, schools, hospi tals and other potentia l users.

Data from the National Health In- terview Surve y show o nly 36% of health care worke rs are a gainst influ- enza ea ch ye ar. Rationale Health car e workers infecte d with influenza can transm it the highl y con tagious virus to pa- tients. This i s particularly troubling for many patients at high risk for i nfluenza-related com - plications, where it can lea d to serious illness or death. Medical literature suggests that health care workers can be a key source of outbreaks in a variety of health care settin gs. The y encounter high-risk patients during t he influenza season in medical pra ctices, general hospitals, specialty hospitals, long-term care and rehabilitati on fa- cilities, home care sites, and other health care settings.

(An Iowa Department of Publ ic Health and Imm uni- zation Coalition action step.) 1018 Goal Statement Educate health care providers and the public on the use of antibiotics for ear infections. Baselin e: See Ration ale. Rationale Approxim ately 30% of ear infections are classifi ed as otitis media with effusion, which does not require anti microbial treat ment. Throug h pro motion, use of antibiotics for this condition can be reduced substantiall y. The Iowa Antibiotic Resist ance Task Force (I ARTF) that convened in Januar y 1998 publishe d a guideline in 1999 for all Io wa health care pro- viders. It covers the use of antim icrobials in otitis media with effusion. All Iowa health care providers will be asked to r eview the guideline to educate themselve s on strategies to deter anti- biotic resistance.

The boundaries of concern are wide and enco m- pass individuals fro m women' s health across the lifespan to infants, children, adolescents, and youn g adults. Both health status and the health services that maintain and i mprove health are acknowledged. Special attention is gi ven to the public health infrastructure that supports the provision of a ccessible and quality services. Children and youth with sp ecial health care needs, that is, children with long-term chronic and disabling conditions and representing ap- proxim ately 17% of children (Iowa Child and Family Hous ehold Health Surve y 2000), are the specific focus of a num ber of goals. A unif ying vision for this c hapter is the con- cept, \"Fam ily Quality of Li fe.\" This concept proposes that a primary role of maternal and child health ( MCH) programs in Iowa is to sup- port fam ilies who are by nature diverse in com - position an d structure. Families are important because it is within their structure that children form strong, stable, em otional attach ments, and throug h them that children meet continuing physical, e motional and soc ial needs. Family qualit y of life depends on r oles and interactions, both withi n the fam ily and between the fam ily and the comm unity , that influence the health and well being of children. Maternal and child health programs can help families meet the needs of children in several areas: 1) material support; 2) em otional support; 3) socializati on; and 4) ba sic life skills. Fam ilies are challenged to m eet these fundamental needs. Despite a growing economy, the average incom e of Iowa fa milies with children has re mained es- sentially unchanged from levels of a decade ago (according to the U.S. Census Bureau). The percentage of Iowa children in p overt y accord- ing to the 20 00 U.S. Census was 10.7% . There are many other factors that may nega- tively impact family functi oning. Substance abuse, fam ily violence, m ental illness, and inap- propriate parental expectations are significant contributors. Social isolation and discrimination based on race , ethnicity or social status may hin- der fam ilies' . Fam ilies whose children have special health care ne eds are additionally affected b y econom ic and emotional challenges. Even the best functioning fa milies are li kely to need outside help when caring for a physically or em otionally ill or i njured child. T he \"Fam ily Quality of Lif e\" concept has motivated a chapter of broad scop e with recognition that families and the service sy stem intera ct for diverse reasons and at var ying intensities. Although the overall Iowa infant m ortality rate has approxim ated th e federal 2000 goal of 7 deaths per 1,000 live births for the past several years, there continues to be a wide and unac- ceptable disparity in the ra tes for white and Af- rican-American infants. The African-American rate is more than three times the white rate. Greate r than twofold differences betw een these groups also e xist for low b irth weight an d ver y low birth weight rates. Rate disparities am ong other dem ographic groups must also be m oni- tored and dea lt with. At mid-decad e, continuity of care and inte- grated sy stems re main challenges. Care coordi- nation is a well-accepted q uality strategy ; how- ever, further docum entatio n of its cost- effectiveness is still needed. A sy stem atic ap- proach to m onitoring and t racking at-risk infants remains absent, but is gain ing sup port f or its developm ent. Progress has been made through April 2005 Chap ter 1 1 - Page 1 of 22 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Mater nal, Infant & Child Hea lth medical ho me and early childhoo d systems building efforts. It is encouraging that the core public health functions of a ssessment, po licy developm ent, and assuranc e are being practiced more aggressi vely and competently by Iowa' s state and loca l MCH-relat ed agencies. As part of this enhance ment, a new goal addresses the pre-service tr aining of MCH professionals. Accessibility of mental and behavioral health services has long be en a problem in Iowa, as well as nationall y. Une qual distribut ion of providers, u nder identification of need, i nappro- priate referral patterns, and inadequate insurance coverage contribute to t he problem . These prob- lems all persi st at mid-decade; however, solu- tions are being pursued. Among these are the Governor-sup ported m ental health sy stem redes- ign efforts, th e early childh ood health y mental developm ent project, and experimental use of telehealth technolo gy to improve access to men- tal health providers. A new goal addresses the importance of early identifi cation of infa nts and toddlers at risk for m ental health or beh avioral problem s. Postpartum depression is a serious mental health condition for wom en that create a n enor- mous burden. According t o the World Health Organization, depression is one of the leading causes in the world of lost years of healthy life among women. Postpartum depr ession can no longer be ignored. It resul ts in increased risks of maladaptive social, em otional and cogni tive de- velopm ent in children with detrimental effects on the fam ily structure and environm ent. A new goal specifica lly addresses postpartum depres- sion. There re mains a concern re garding the safety and quality of child care environments. Many child care providers are not prope rly trained in health and safety procedures, includ- ing procedures applicable to children with spe- cial health ca re needs. The goal related to child care has be en deleted in de ference to a s ufficient representatio n in Chapter 5 (Educationa l and Community -Based Progra ms). Across the U nited States, m ore than six m il- lion children are being raised in ho useho lds headed b y grandparents and other relatives as parents struggle with subst ance abuse, mental illness, incarceration, econom ic hardship, di- vorce, dom estic violence, and ot her serious chal- lenges. These fa mily members are c aring for the children bot h inside and ou tside of the fo ster care sy stem . As of March 2003 , the Iow a De- partment of Hu man Services had a total of 4,953 children in o ut-of-hom e placements. Although the rate of first trimester entry into prenatal care is improving, the im portan ce of this preventiv e behavior de mands continued at- tention. S pecial attention must be directed to vulnerable po pulations suc h as minorit y, refugee and immigrant grou ps. Currently, Io wa law requires all newborns and infants born in the state of Iowa to be screen ed for the following: biotinidase, con- genital adrenal h yperplasia, Neonatal Metabolic Screen- ing Pro gram identifies babies who may have one of these disorders and alerts the baby 's health care provider to the need fo r further testing and special care. With early diagnosis and tr eat- ment, co mplications from these serious disorders can usually be prevented. Iowa passed a law in 2004 that req uires a newborn hearing screening test on all newborns befor e hospital dis charge. Because Iowa has done well in screening new- borns for hearing loss, the target for this goal has been increase d. Despite an ab undance of pr ivate and pub lic initiatives, there continues to be a m ajor problem obtainin g insurance coverage for all Iowa chil- dren. Insurance status is i mportant bec ause it strongl y corre lates with health care-seeking be- havior. Data sy stem s to gui de plan ning an d monitor- ing of the health care sy stem for childre n and families are i mproving. T he Iowa Child and Family Hous ehold Health Surve y, com pleted in 2001 and full y anal yzed in 2003 , provides a populati on-ba sed data source for rational in- formed planning and accountability monitoring. The survey will be re-ad ministered in 2006. Important database integrat ion efforts are un- derway in the Iowa Department of Publi c Health and the Iowa Department of Education E arly ACCESS Program . Chap ter 1 1 - Page 2 of 22 April 2005 Maternal, Infant & Child Health HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision In the past, maternal and child health program s focus ed prim arily on children a nd their phy sical health. This was mostly accomplished through provi sion of, or pa yment for, direct health car e service s. This direct service model is changing. The MCH programs will im prove children's health a nd well-being by focusing on families an d the service sy stem that supports t hem. The federal Maternal and Child Health Bureau has placed em phasis by prom oting a model that en courages more \"population-based ser- vices\" and \"infrastructure building hea lth care servi ces.\" The intended ser- vice em phases are depicted in the illustra tion below. DIRECT HEALTH CARE SERVICES : (Gap Fi lling) Examples: Clinics - Family Planning Special Populations, Medically Underserved Areas, and CH Specialty Clinics Gap filling Services ENABLING SERVICES: Examples: Early ACCE SS Service Coordination, Transportation, Translation, OB Indigent, Respite Care, Health Education, Family Support Services, FP Education & Counseling, EPSDT Informing & Care Coordination, Outreach, WIC, Enhanced Services, Ill & Handicapped Waiver, and Continuity of Care Program POPULATION-BASED SERVICES: Examples: Universal Newborn Screening, Abstinence E ducation, Lead Screening, Immunization, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Counseling, Oral Health, Injury Prevention, HCCI, Outreach/Public Education, Newborn Hearing Detection, and Screening Clinics INFRASTRUCTURE BUILDING SERVICES: Examples: CHNA-HIP, Community & Program Planning, Policy Development, Agency Coordination, Empowerment - local system planning, Quality Assurance, Standards Development, Monitoring, Training, Applied Research, DECAT, Information Systems, Maternal Health Database, CAReS, Statewide Perinatal Care Program, Early ACCESS System, Regional Autism Services Program, Title V Household Health Survey, and Inclusive Child Care System Planning H:MCHADV/pyramid-ia.ppt (powerpoint) 10/2001 The m odel does not intend to abando n the direct care ne eds of individual fa milies, but rather to fill gaps as necessary while im proving the overall service sy stem for all fam ilies. Fam i- lies and their co mmunities are adjusting to new trends, m ost notably greater local control of ser- vice priorities (devolution), and the increasing presence of managed car e. Public health pro- grams play a role in m onitoring s ystem changes. This is acco mplished through activities such as assessment of the population; assurance of ser- vice acc essibi lity and quality polic y ment; program evaluation; and inform ation and data sy stem development. Due to a growing fam ily focus and a shifting maternal and child health service e mphasis, this chapter' s goa ls are greate r in num ber and breadth than the MCH goals for Healthy Iowans 2000 . There are still traditional MCH goals re- lated to infant mortality , birthweight, pre natal care, and new born screening. There are also new, less trad itional goals related to med ical homes, insurance coverage , behavioral h ealth, pre-service e ducation, and data sy stems. Other MCH concerns such as unintentio nal injur y, child abuse, environ mental exposure, adolescent su icide, breastf eeding, obesity, and women's health issues su canc er, cardio- vascular dise ase, do mestic violence have goals in other chapters. The goals and action steps here do not re flect every relevant MCH-related issue for fa milies; however , they do represent a April 2005 Chap ter 1 1 - Page 3 of 22 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Mater nal, Infant & Child Hea lth thoug htful co nsensus of go als to guide i m- provem ent of health and q uality of life f or Iowa families over the next decade. There are two major source s for the goals included in this chapter. The first is the national Healthy People 2010 document based on the rationale that national goals are for the most part relevant to in dividual states. The second source is the national and state-specific goals of the Iowa Title V (of the Social Security Act) Pro- gram . Title V goals are based on issues of estab- lished nationa l importance and Iowa-specific needs ass essment results. The broadest goals from the source pool were chosen as chapter goals, while s maller scale goals fr om the pool were transfor med into action steps. Some of the g oals from the pool were eliminated due to duplication or gr eater relevance to other chapters. Organizing the chapter goals was chall eng- ing. A sim ple long list of goals was thought t o be confusing and difficult t o interpret with re- spect to co mpleteness and relevance. Similarly , choosing a ta xonom y to organize the chapter was difficult because no single approach see med to pro vide op timum order and flow of g oals. Ultimately, the team agreed on a sim ple fam iliar approach categorization b y age gro up. For this chapter, three groups were chosen: newborn and infant; ch ild and adoles cent; and maternal health. Within each age ca tegory , there are goals related to bot h health status and dir ect health care services. An additional category system infrast ructure contains a few goals spe- cifically supporting the MCH servic e system infrastructure. To stay curre nt with evol ving natio nal and state MCH pr iorities, chapter goals were re- viewed and reorganized at the m id-course re- view. A su mmary of the new goals follows: Original goal 11-1: \"Infant mortality rate\" Original goal 11-2: \"Low a low birth weight\" \"Newborn hearing screening\" y care provid- ers\" Original 11-8: \"Perinatal mortality 11-12: 11-15: \"Shared management pro- tocols for chil dren with special health ca re needs\" Newborn & Infant Goals 111 Goal Statement Reduce the overall infant mortality rate to no more than 5 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, pa ying spe cific attention to the discrepanc y of African-Americ an fant mortality 1,000; African 14.0 per 1,000.

Rationale Infant m ortality is a critical indicator of the health of a population because it reflects the overall state of maternal health, as well as the quality and a ccessibility of prim ary health care available to pregnant women and infant s. Ad- vances in medical technology and access to care have produce d declines in i nfant m ortality rates across the co untry , including Iowa. Iowa's infant mortality rate has been less than the U.S. rate; however , residents of Iowa' s metropolitan counties (>50,000 i nhabita nts) have higher r ates closer t o the national average Chap ter 1 1 - Page 4 of 22 April 2005 Maternal, Infant & Child Health HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision than residents of the sm all urban (>5,0 00, b ut < 50,00 0 inhabitants) or rur al (<5,000 i nhabi- tants) counties. This rate difference by population density reflects the continu ing difference in rates am ong racial and/or ethnic subgro ups. The infa nt mor- tality rate for African-A mericans in Iowa was 13.9 per 1,0 00 in 2000 and 10.3 per 1,0 00 in 2001 . Birth defects (which also cause infant mor- bidity) are one of the four causes that account for over half of infant deat hs; the others are low birthweight, Sudden Infan Sy ndrome (SIDS), and respiratory distress sy ndrome. Categories of birth defects that can be prevented include neural tube defects throug h the u se of adequate folic acid by women before and d uring pregnanc y. Approxim ately 50% to 70% of neu- ral tube defect case s can be prevented if all women of childbearing age consum e at least 400 micrograms of folic acid daily. In addition, t here are genetic conditions that may not be preventable, but that can be screened for at birth to allow for early intervention. Thus, all newborns can be screened for conditi ons such as phenylketo nuria, sickle cell anem ia and h ypo- thyroidism . For confirm ed diagnoses, such in- terventions as a dietary form ula for pheny and horm one treatment for h ypothyroid- ism can significantly decre ase morbidity and death. SIDS is the leading cause of postneonatal mortality among all racial and ethnic gr oups, representing nearly one third of all cases of postneonatal death cases in Iowa. Although t he SIDS rate has been declining steadil y nation- wide since the inception of the \"Back to Sleep Cam paign\" in 199 4, Iowa's SIDS rate still ex- ceeds that of the nation as a whole. In 2000 and 2001 , the n umber of reported SIDS cases de- creased fro m the num ber reported in 1999. As a group, SIDS deaths am ong m inority populations comprise app roxim ately 16.2% of the total SIDS deaths in Iowa each y ear. The Healthy Iowans 20 10 family planni ng chapter has goals and action steps directed at reducing the problem of unintended pregnanc y among all women and preventing all pre gnanc y among fem ales ages 12-17 years. These fam ily planning goal s and action steps are im portant in reducing infa nt mortality and ot her adverse pregnanc y outcomes 111.1 Action Step By 2006, prom ote prenatal risk screening, targeting high-risk wo men such as Afric an- American wo men, to identify factors which may influence the health of the i nfant and dist ribute prenatal risk screening guidelines to prenatal care providers. (An Iowa Department of Public Health, Iowa Depart ment of Hu man Ser vices, and Iowa Departm ent of Hu man Rights action step.) 111.2 Action Step Throug h 2010, contin ue educational ini tia- tives to increase the proportion of wom en of childbearing age who take a daily vitam in with the reco mmended dose of 400 m icrograms of folic acid for the purpose of decreasing the inci- dence of neural tube defects. (An Iowa Depart- ment of Publi c Health actio n step.) 111.3 Action Step By 2010, facilitate use of resear ch-based and innovati ve methods that assist pregnant wo men to modify high-risk behavi ors, such as alcohol use, illicit drug use, and tobacco use. Prom ote universal screening of pregnant wom en to detect substance abuse. (An Iowa Department of Pub- lic Health act ion step.) 111.4 Action Step Through 2010, continue to assure availa bil- ity of a m etabolic newborn screening panel to every infant born in I owa, with periodic review of included m etabolic disorders. (An Iowa De- partm ent of Public Health action step.) 111.5 Action Step Throug h 2010, contin ue educational ini tia- tives to increase the portion of infants w ho are breastfed. Educate hospital personnel in Iowa maternity hospitals and child care providers to available reso urces for the provision of breast- feeding supp ort.

Educate hospit al personnel in Iowa hospitals that provide obstetrical car e to place healthy, newborn i nfants o n their backs in the newborn nurs ery as a m odel for new parents. Provide traini ng for chil d care providers throug h the Healthy Child Care Iowa SIDS education program s. (An Iowa Sudde n Infant Death S yn- drom e (SIDS) Foun dation, Iowa Department of Public Health, and Iowa Perinatal Review Pro- gram action step.) Low birth weight (<25 00 grams) and pre- term delivery are specific ally related to poor birth o utcom es, includin g infant m ortality. Low birth weight ( LBW) fro m pre-term birth or in- trauterine growth retardation is the risk f actor most closely associat ed wi th neonatal mortality (death within 28 da ys of birth). Infants s urviv- ing LBW also have a high er risk for fut ure de- velopm ental disabilities, including neur ologic problem s. Very low birth weight (<150 0 grams) is nearly alway s due to pre-ter m birth, and is itself a major risk factor for neonatal death. Very low birth weight is associated with mater- nal nutritional status, infection, m ultiple births, and use of tobacco and alcohol during preg- nancy . 111.7 Action Step By 2010, dev elop statewide autops y and death scene protocols (proc edures) for sudden and unexpect ed deaths occurring i n infancy. (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health and Medical Examiner' s Office action st ep.) The effects of licit and illici t drugs, i nclud- ing alcohol, t obacco, cocaine, marijuana, meth, and som e prescription m edications, on t he de- veloping fetus are well documented. Heavy al- cohol use is associated wit h fetal alcohol syn- drom e (FAS) and m oderate alcohol use h as demonstrated effects on pre-ter m delive ry. To- bacco use during pregnancy is associate d with the onset of p remature labor, fetal growth retar- dation, l ow birth weight, sp ontaneous ab ortion, and SIDS. T he use of cocaine during pregnancy is associat ed with premature birth, im paired fetal growth, neonatal seizur es, and m aternal infec- tions such as hepatitis B and the hum an immu- nodeficiency virus (HIV). Marijuana use during pregnanc y may be associated with low birth weight, preterm birth, and neurobehavio ral func- tioning that is not norm al; however, it is difficult to isolate the effects of marijuana on ne wborns because user s often also us e both alcohol and tobacco. 111.8 Action Step By 2010, assure state capa city to offer ap- propriate hig h-risk perinatal services to wo men experiencing m ultiple gest ation pregnancies. High-risk perinatal service s include acc ess to experienced and k nowledg eable providers and facilities specializing in hi gh-risk perinatal care. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health and Iowa Depart ment of Hu man Ser vices action s tep.) 112 Goal Statement Reduce overall low birth w eight t o an in- cidence of no more than 5 % of liv e births; and overall very low birth weight to no more than 1 % of live births. Spe- cific attention should be paid to the dis- parities of African-Am erican low birth weight and very low birth w eight rates. Baselin e: Overall lo w birth weight - 6.6 %, White - 6.5%, African-Ame rican- 10.4%. Very low -American - 2.3%. Source: Iowa De partment of Pub lic Health, Burea u of Vi tal Statistics, 2002. Women at particular risk for havin g low birth weight infants include teenagers and Afri- can-Americans. Short i nterpregnancy in tervals, psychosocial stress, delay ed prenatal care, and low pregnancy weight gain s are possible risk factors for low birth weight. 112.1 Action Step Through 2010, prom ote prenatal risk scr een- ing, targeting high-risk women such as African- American wo men, to identify factors that may influence the health of the mother and infant. Chap ter 1 1 - Page 6 of 22 April 2005 Maternal, Infant & Child Health HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Rationale Distribute prenatal risk scre ening guidelines to prenatal care providers. (A n Iowa Departm ent of Public Health and Iowa Department of Hu- man Service s action step.) The future of children born with signific ant hearing loss depends largely on early identifica- tion foll owed b y imm ediate and appropr iate in- tervention. If children with hearing loss are not identified early, it is difficult, if not impossible, for them to acquire fundamental languag e, social and cogniti ve skills. With early identific ation and interventi on, children with hearing l oss make dra matic progress. In 2004, a m andatory law was estab lished requiri ng all newbor ns to be screen ed for hearing loss prior to discha rge in obstetric and birthing hosp itals. 112.2 Action Step By 2010, facilitate use of proven research- based and innovative m ethods to assist wo men to abstain fro m alcohol dur ing preg nancy.

Rationale The death rate am ong children has declined substantially over the past decades, but the de- cline has slowed in recent years. The leading cause of deat h for children of all ages is injur y (motor vehicle crashes, drowning, and f ire and/or b urns for children a ged 1-4, an d motor vehicle crash es and firear ms for children aged 5- 14), which fo r the m ost part is preventable. Congenital an omalies, malignant neo plasms (cancer), and heart diseas e are other leading causes of chil dhood m ortality. The Iow a Child Death Review Team review s all infant and child deaths fro m birth thro ugh 17 years of age and makes reco mmendations for future prev ention of childhood m ortality . 114.1 Action Step Through 2010, provide technical assista nce as requested t o the Em ergency Medical Services (EMS) for efforts regarding the special emer- gency -related needs of children with special health care ne eds. (An Iowa Department of Pub- lic Health act ion step). 114.2 Action Step By 2010, im plem ent the array of child m or- tality preventi on recommen dations (including improved co mpliance with the use of motor ve- hicle child restraints, bicy cle hel mets, fe ncing around p ools, firearm use and storage safety recommendations, and ex pansion of caregiver first aid and CPR training) set forth b y the Iowa Child Death Review Te am, with special e mpha- sis on the revised state and local child mortality investigation and reporting procedures. (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health actio n step.) 114.3 Action Step By 2010, exp and the \"Health y Opp ortunities for Parents to Experience Success \" progra m (HOPES) and the Comm unity Em powerment initiative to deal with issues related to parenting skill deficits, such as social isolation, emotional alienation, and lack of info rmation, that may unintenti onall y endanger children u nder the care of unprepared parents. (An Iowa Department of Public Health action step.) 114.4 Action Step By 2010, inte nsify efforts to deliver cult ur- ally targeted and la nguage -appropriate educa- tional m essages regarding an array of preventive care and prac tices (such as caretake r stress man- agement, resp ite care options, infant sleep prac- tices, motor vehicle child restraint use, bicy cle safety , second-hand t obacco sm oke exposure, and sm oke al arm use) that reduce the risks of intentional and uni ntentional child m ortalit y.

Baseli ne: Natio nal - 57%. Source: Parental Assessment of Developme nt in the Pe- diatric Office, Pediatri cs, Ju ne 200 4. Rationale Early childhood screening for mental and behavioral health problem s increase s the likeli- hood that chil dren experiencing or at-risk for mental health problem s wil l receive eff ective assessments a nd, if needed , therapeutic interven- tion. Yo ung children in ne ed of age-appropriate mental and behavioral health services often do not receive those service s due to under- identification of need and/o r inappropriat e refer- ral patterns. Other factors include the lack of qualified m ental health pro viders and lo w Medi- caid reim bursem ent rates. Public programs have the responsibilit y to provide, co ordinate or adv ocate for specialty services, incl uding m ental health service s.

(A n Iowa Department of Public Health action step. ) 119 Goal Statement Increase the number of accessible pro- fessionals w ho provide mental health services for w omen of reproductive age and their families. Baseline: See Ra tionale. Rationale Depression is considered an un derreported problem . Women report a reluctance to discuss their em otions during t he perinatal period due to the perceived stigma as sociated with it. Many women do not realize that t hey are suffering from a treatable condition and are often left to deal with the problem on their own. Wi thout appropriate treat ment, perinatal depressi on can dramatically affect wo men and their families. Data fro m prenatal car e survey s indicate the extent of the problem in Iowa.

Health car e providers in Iowa indi- cate that they understand th e importance of early screening and identification of perinatal depres- sion. However, they are reluctant to screen and identify clients who may be at-risk for depres- sion because of the providers' lack of awarene ss of available resources for c lient interventions. The Iowa Departm ent of Public Health and the University of Iowa Center f or Depression and Clinical Research will be collecting data through a phy sician surve y in the next year to determ ine the baseline. 119.2b A ction Step By 2008, promote use of and trainin g for standardized, validated asse ssment tools for postpartum depression.

(An Iowa Depart ment of Public Health action step.) Increase to at least 90% the prop ortion of all pregnant w omen who receive earl y and adequate prenatal care as measured by the Ade quac y of Prenatal Care Utiliza- tion Index (Kotelchuk Index). Base line: 89%. Source : Iowa Dep artment of Public Health, Burea u of Vi tal Statistics, 2002. Rationale System Infrastructure Goals Prenatal car e reduces perinatal morbidity and m ortality by ident ifying and reducing poten- tial risks and helping wom en to deal with behav- ioral factors that contribute to po or outcomes. Prenatal car e is more effe ctive if receive d early in pregnanc y and contin ued thro ughout preg- nancy . There are dem ographic gro ups at-risk for inadequate prenatal car e. In Iowa, African- American, Hi spanic, and Americ an Indian preg- nant wom en enter first-trimest er prenat al care at lower rates th an white pregnant wom en. Also, according to t he 2002 findi ngs by the \"Iowa Bar- riers to Prenatal Care Project,\" m others under 18 years old were more likely to report diffi culty obtaining pre natal care and more likely to com - plete a pregnancy without any prenatal care. 1111 Goal Statement Fully devel op Io wa as a state that has a service s ystem for Children w ith Special Health Care Needs that is community - based, famil y-centered , coordinated, comprehensive, and c ulturall y compe- tent. Baseli ne: See Ratio nale. Rationale Children with special healt h care needs are defined as children who ha ve or are at-risk for chronic condi tions, inclu ding ps ychosoc ial, de- velopm ental and phy sical conditions. T hey also need health and related services bey ond those required b y children gener ally. Service sy stems for such child ren should be organized ne tworks of services wi th the following qualities: co mpre- hensive, comm unity -based, coordinated, fa mily- centered, and culturally com petent. Each qualit y contributes to optim izing the child's health as well as to strengthening the family's ability to care for and support them selves and their child within a complex service s ystem . The Kotelchuk Index is an index that i ndi- cates the ade quacy of prenatal car e base d on the start ti me of prenatal car e and the num ber of prenatal visits. 1110.1 Action Step By 2010, use inform ation regarding barr iers to early prenatal care a s a basis to collaborate with the Iowa Department of Human Rights on strategies that can be suggested for local mater- nal health agencies to acce ss and serve pregnant women, especially racially and culturall y diverse populati ons and wom en with disabilities. (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health and Iowa De- partm ent of Hu man Rights action step.) 1111.1 Action Step By 2010, m onitor polic y changes that allow health care providers to be come service coordi- nators for children with special health c are needs in Iowa's Early ACCESS sy stem when t hat op- tion best m eets the needs of the child and fa mily. (An Iowa Departm ent of Education and Early ACCESS Co uncil Executi ve Committee action step.) 1110.2 Action Step By 2010, promote use of the Kotelchuk Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization Index to assess the adequacy of the initiation of prenatal care and the a dequacy of the use of prenatal ser- vices once care has begun. (An Iowa Depart- ment of Publi c Health actio n step.) 1111.2 Action Step By 2007, con tribute to t he developm ent of a second statewide population-based Iowa Child and Fam ily Household Health Surve y (with over-sam pling design for minorit y populations) April 2005 Chap ter 1 1 - Page 13 of 2 2 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Mater nal, Infant & Child Hea lth in order to obtain needs assessment data, includ- ing inf ormation o n the n umber and percentage of children with special hea lth care needs in Iowa and the health care issues facing them . (A Child Health Specialty Clinics, Iowa Depart ment of Public Health, and University of Iowa P ublic Policy Center action step.) 1112 Goal Statement Increase to 98 % the pe rcent of children in the state (including children w ith spe- cial health care needs) with a source of health care insurance for primary and specialty care. Baselin e: 91.4%. So urce: 2003 Cen sus. 1111.3 Action Step Rationale By 2010, revi ew and im prove avenues to assure fa mily participation in program and pol- icy activities within Iowa's Title V Children with Special Health Car e Needs Progra m in partnership with state level fam ily advoc acy or- ganizations. (A Child Health Specialty Clinics action step.) Insurance coverage with an adequate scope of benefits is essential to im proving acc ess to health care for all children birth thr ough age 18. According to Health Insurance Coverage of Children in I owa: Results from the Iowa Child and F amily Household Health Survey released in Ma y 2004, uninsured ch ildren, when com- pared to insur ed children, r eported a hig her un- met need for care. Uninsured children are also less likely to have a regular source of medical or dental care. 1111.4 Action Step By 2006, make reco mmen dations as man- dated by the I owa Legislat ure related to the de- sign of an im proved service sy stem that meet s the developmental and beh avioral needs of Iowa children and f amilies. (An Iowa Department of Human Services MH/M R/DD/BI Co mmission action step.) With respect to ethnicity , Hispanic children are twic e as li kely to be uninsured as non- Hispanic children. With re spect to fa mily stress, families of uninsured childr en report a hi gher rate of substance abuse an d a higher rat e of worry regardi ng abilit y to pay for their chil- dren's health care. Of the approxim ately 6% of Iowa children who are unin sured, about 80% are eligible for M edicaid or the hawk-i Progr am. This suggests the im portan ce of outreac h efforts to increase en rollment of children into coverage. Children with special healt h care needs are dis- proporti onately low-income and, therefore, more likely to have Medicaid as their source of cover- age. 1111.5 Action Step By 2010, promote the Iowa Medical Ho me Initiative in it s leadership efforts to establish the medical ho me model as a standard of q uality care for children with speci al health car e needs.

Baseline: Iowa will Maternal and Child He alth (MCH) B ureau Natio nal Plan for MCH train ing to guide o ur metho ds in base - line measurement. A baseline will be collected by 2007. Currently, vital records are a key source of inform ation for both needs asse ssment a nd per- formance monitoring, but utilization is not opti- mal. Efforts m ust be made to link vital r ecords and programmatic data in order to enha nce sur- veillance, to m onitor progress of current initia- tives, and to detect e merging issues. The ele- ments to build a m ore info rmative stat ewide data system are present, but are not fully used to measure outcomes, support polic y reco mmenda- tions, and defend accountabilit y. Rationale As the public health environment changes, it is im portant that the education of public health April 2005 Chap ter 1 1 - Page 15 of 2 2 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Mater nal, Infant & Child Hea lth providers also evolves. The content and instruc- tional strategies of pre-serv ice educational ex- periences provide powerful foundati ons t o the way Iowa's maternal and child health ( MCH) professionals will practice. Due to the com - plexities of institutional bureaucracies, it may be slow and difficult to m odify pre-service educa- tion. But it is at the pre-ser vice level where formative and focused lear ning experiences oc- cur. Opportunities for in-service training are felt to be accessib le and adequate. 1115 Goal Statement Increase to 75 % the pe rcent of children with specia l health care needs enrolled in managed care w ho h ave a written plan of shared management protocols devel- oped in partnership w ith primary and specialty care providers, care coordina- tion providers, and families.

The following are obstacle s to the realiza- tion of t his vision: The stigma that surrounds mental illness; Treat ment limitations a nd financial require- ments placed on m ental he alth benefits in private health insurance; Fragmentatio n of the m ental health services delivery s ystem;and The \"scienc e-to-service\" ga p in which evi- dence-based practices are not being optimally translated into clinical settings. According to the National Institute of Men- tal Health, in any given year over 19 m illion people in the U.S. suffer from an anxiet y disor- der (the m ost common mental illness), just under that num ber from a depressive illness, and about two m illion each fro m schizophrenia, bi polar disorder, and attention disorders. Globally, approxim ately 121 m illion people experience a depressive disorder each year. In fact, depressi on will be the second greatest cause of premature death and dis ability worldwide by the year 2020, according to a health study by the World Health Organization. Often thoug ht of as an \"adu lt\" health pro b- lem, mental illness is also one of the greatest threats to the health and well being of children and adolesce nts. One out of every five children and adolesce nts in the United States has a men- tal health problem that can be identified and treated. At least 10%, or about six m illion chil- dren, have a serious em otional disorder. Only 33% of all children with mental disorders re- ceive treat ment. While suicide is the ninth lead- ing cause of death in the United States, it is the third leading cause of deat h for people aged 15 to 24 and the sixth for ages 5 to15. The inci- dence of suicide am ong 15- to 24- year-ol ds has tripled since 1969. These startling statistics be- come underst andable when one realizes t hat as many as one i n 33 chil dren and one in eight ado- lescents have clinical depression. The increasin g num ber of youth in t he juve- nile justice syste m also has serious mental health implications. Each y ear, more than one million youths com e into contact with this s ystem na- tionally , and more than 100,000 are placed in some type of correctional facility . Studies con- sistently show that the proportion of the juvenile justice popula tion with m ental disorders is two to three tim es higher than that foun d in t he gen- eral populatio n. Several in cidents of extrem e school violen ce have shocked the natio n in re- cent y ears. In all of these case s, the y outhful perpetrators were suffering from some type of mental disorder. The com bined indirect and related costs of mental illness are i mmense and include t he cost of lost produc tivity , lost earnings due to illness, and societal c osts such as increas ed cri minal justice and family caregiver costs. Clinical de- pression alone the $65 billion. Adequate funding is ke y to realization of the goals of this Healthy Iowans 201 0 chapter. Lack of fiscal and hum an re sources has i mpeded pro- gress on the original goals, although stake- holders rem ain committed to do all t hat is possi- ble to assure progress toward their accom plish- ment. Mental disorders also have a significant im- pact on the total health car e system . Up to half April 2005 Chap ter 1 2 Page 1 of 26 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Mental Health & Mental Disorders of all visits to prim ary care physicians are due to conditions caused or m ade worse by such disor- ders. People with depression are at least four times more likely to have a heart attack than those without such a histor y. Rou ghly 37% of alcohol abusers and 53% of drug ab users also have at least one form of serious mental illness. Fortunatel y, mental illness is treatable i n many instanc es. The treat ment succ ess rate is 60% for schizophrenia; 8 0% for bipolar disor- ders; and 63% for major depression. In contrast, the treat ment succes s rate f or heart disease ranges fro m 41% to 52% . In spite of thes e posi- tive treat ment rates, more than 41 m illion Americans la ck health in surance, and even those who are insured generally do not have an y kind of meaningful parit y in insurance coverage for mental health disorders the sa me as cove rage for other ailments. As a result , the average growth in the am ount expended for treatm ent of mental disorders and substance abuse was 7.2% be- tween 1986 a nd 1996, nota bly slower th an the 8.3% average growth rate for other health care expenditures. According to federal data, Iowa has close to 108,000 ad ults (aged 19 an d above) with a seri- ous m ental ill ness and an esti mated total of 85,000 childr en (aged 0 to 18) in need of mental health intervention. Progress Significant Changes The Mental Health, Mental Retardatio n, De- velopm ental Disabilities, and Brain Injury (MH/MR/DD Co mmission was char ged by Iowa's General Assem bly to redesign th e mental health and dis ability system . The Co mmission gave a preliminary report to the Govern or and General A ssembly in January 2004 recommend- ing changes in the adult s ystem. The re asons for changing the current sy stem were to enhance equity of access to high quality services state- wide, to fund basic servic es for m ore peo ple, and to addres s the fundin g barriers. Adult disability redesig n. The new adult s ystem envisions universal ac cess to in- formation and education, crisis servic es, and service coordination, i ncluding li nkages to basic supports such as housing s ubsidies, utili ty subsi- dies, food assistance, transportation subsidies, and m edical and dental care. It also envisions consistent financial and clinical eligibilit y crite- ria across the state, as well as a core s et of ser- vices availabl e state wide. It also reco mmends elimination of legal settlement and changes in how state funds are allocated to counties . Recognition that children's mental health services are delivered differentl y than adult services. Since the mid-1980s, there has been a growing e mphasis on school- based service s for children. This began with initiatives from the state an d continued with a growing com mitment fro m many local s chool boards. Man y new early childho od programs emphasiz e the i mportance of the social, e mo- tional and be havioral developm ent of children. Child w elfare redesign. The Iowa De- partment of Hu man Services spent more than a year revam ping the child welfar e system that is being im plemented in 20 05. One signifi cant change will im pact mental health services to children - m any children w ith m ental health needs who are currently being served thr ough the child welfare sy stem will instead be served through comm unity resources in the future. This is significant because, hist orically , Iowa' s child welfar e system provided treat ment services and by default acted as the child m ental he alth ser- vice sy stem in Iowa for children with the most serious em otional disorder s. The redesigned child welfare system will reduce the vol ume of children served in that s ystem by referring th ose without safety needs to co mmunity care. Rise of consumer and famil y advo - cacy. Consumers and fa mily m embers of chil- dren with m ental health disorders are pa rticipat- ing on every level of sy stem design (i.e., local, regional and state). Mental health consu mers and fam ilies of children w ith m ental health dis- orders take their role as primary stakeholders seriously and play an im portant role in th e plan- ning and deli very of services. They no longer simply accept lack of parity for m ental he alth services, inad equate funding, inequi ty of eligi- bility criteria across the state, and a narrow range of services avail able in rural areas. As consumers of mental healt h services co ntinue to Chap ter 1 2 Page 2 of 26 April 2005 Mental Health & Mental Disorders HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision claim their ri ghtful place in the overall spectru m of health care services, it is inevitable that there will be signifi cant changes to the s ystem's pub- lic and privat e components. Assertive Community Treatment (ACT). ACT is a model of intensive community outreach to facilitate the treat ment of sev erely and persistently m entally ill indivi duals. Iowa currently has four ACT pro grams funded pri- marily by Medicaid' s Iowa Plan for Behavioral Health through Magellan Health Services. The need for effective and intensive co mmunity- based service s for people who had previously been considered too ill t o live outside of residen- tial settings requires services with the intensity , accountability and com prehensiveness of ACT. The Mental Health Planning and Ad visor y Council includes ACT as o ne of its prior ities for the adult s ystem in future planning. U.S. Supre me Court's Olmstead deci- sion. As a result of this decision, Iowa received $1.3 m illion, which has been subcontracted to the Center for Disabilities and Development (CDD) at the University of Iowa' s Center on Excellence in Disabilities. Executive Order #27, issued by Governor Tom Vilsack on February 4, 2003 , directed 20 state agencies to collaborate with each other and the Olmste ad Real Choices Consumer Ta skforce to identify barriers to community living f or people with disabilities and steps to re move those barriers. Staf f for the project at the Center for Disabilities and Devel- opment in Iowa City and a t the Em ployment Policy Group, an ar m of the CDD in De s Moines, is pr oviding research, support a nd coor- dination t o all of the efforts mentioned above. These resources support the Iowa Depart ment of Human Services (D HS) as it coordinates and moves forward on t he many intersecting activi- ties associ ated res ic changes in Io wa's population. The African-Am erican population has seen subs tantial growth and there also are growing n umbers of Latino, Asian, Pacific Is- lander, and E astern European people settling in both urban and se mi-rural a reas. These n umbers include imm igrants and refugees, as well as per- sons who are sim ply choosing to m ove to Iowa from other parts of the countr y for personal rea- sons. Povert y, econom ic uncertainty, p revious traumatic exp eriences, and cultural press ures make many of these new re sidents subject to a variety of mental health-related problems. Emerging Trends The dual diagnosis of mental health and substance abuse. The dual dia gnosis of mental health and substance abuse is a c rosscut- ting issue being addressed in collaboration with the team working on Chap ter 20, Drugs and Al- cohol. Fundi ng to expand services for co- occurring dis orders and improve accessi bility to these servic es is being sought by the Iow a De- partment of Public Health. Iowa is also partici- pating in the second National Polic y Academ y on Co-Occurring Su bstance Abuse and Mental Health Disor ders. Emphasis on improving mental health services in the adult corrections system. Due to the growi ng number of adult inmates in the corrections sy stem who have mental or behavioral health issues, the Iowa De- partment of Corrections res earched best prac- tices and is teaching corrections staff new skills and approaches for working with inm ates with mental illnesses. The Iowa Depart ment of Hu- man Services, with the support of t he Mental Health Planning Cou ncil, funded t hree m odel program s that implement successful transition services for c orrectional consumers with serious mental illness, leaving pris on, and retur ning to their hom e communities. The Iowa De partment of Human Services also funded statewide ICN training d uring SFY200 2, \"Streets to Cells and Back Again.\" Over 800 people the traini ng, which focused on m ental health issues w ithin the correctional s ystem .

Increased emphasis on evidence- based practices in mental health. A main conclusion of the surgeon General's Report o n Mental Healt h (1999) involved the so-called \"scienc e-to-service gap.\" That is, many prac- tices that have been show n through rigorous re- search to be e ffective are b eing inadequa tely implem ented in comm unity settings. T he Sub- stance Abuse and Mental Health Services Ad- ministration (SAMHSA) and m any othe r agen- cies have lau nched initiati ves to broade n the knowledge about and im plementation of these practices, and to encourage the adoption of an \"evidence-based culture\" throug hout all mental health delivery sy stem s. National Goals The President' s New Freed om Commission Re- port on Ment al Health enti tled \"Achieving the Prom ise: Transform ing Mental Health Care in America\" established six national goals as a guide in establishing state goals. The following six national g oals are used throug hout this chap- ter as headings for both the accomplishments and Iowa's n ew mental health goals: 1. Americans understand that mental health is essential to overall health. 2. Mental health care is consu mer and fa mily- driven. 3. Disparities in mental healt h services ar e eliminated. 4. Early mental health screeni ng, assess ment and referral t o services ar e common prac- tice. 5. Excellent mental health care is delivere d and resea rch is ac celerat ed. 6. Technolog y is used to coll ect uniform men- tal health data. Accomplishments National Goal #1. Io wans understand that mental health is essential to overall health. Fifteen peopl e were trained b y a nati onal trainer to teach the National Alliance for Men- tally Ill (NAMI) provider education cou rse, a national curri culum to educate providers of men- tal health ser vices about the fam ily and con- sumer's role in treat ment. In 200 4, public co mmunity forum s were held across the state by the Mental Healt h, Men- tal Retardatio n, Developmental Disabili ties, and Brain Injury Commission to share the adult re- design reco mmendations. For the past six years, the Iowa Depart ment of Education's Success4 has conducted work- shops, conferences, in-depth skill training, and Iowa Co mmunication Network (ICN) trainings on m ental health-related topics for educators across the sta te. The Success4 Speciali zed Ser- vices Group created Infor mation-in-a-box kits addressing 14 mental healt h disorders found i n children and adolescents. These kits are located in each Area Education Agency (AEA) Parent Educator Connection library and are available for an yone w anting to learn m ore about any of these disorders. Each kit contains videos, jour- nal articles, books, and res ource lists.

Area Education Agenc y (AEA) 1 developed a bibliography of its librar y collection t hat can be used as a m odel by other AEAs. The Iowans for the Preven tion of Gu n Vio- lence (IPGV) collected journal articles about suicide prevention. A bibl iograph y of this col- Chap ter 1 2 Page 4 of 26 April 2005 Mental Health & Mental Disorders HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision lection is available on the o rganization's web site, www.ip gv.org . In 200 1, the Iowa Department of Publ ic Health conducted a media campaign consisting of a 60-second suicide prevention publi c service announcem ent broadcast on several major tele- vision station s around the s tate. The Departm ent also distribut ed brochures to 25 co untie s that were s elected because of their high incidence of suicides over the past deca de. Iowans for the Prevention of Gun Violence collaborated with the Iowa Dep artment of Public Health to select and distribute these materials. Periodic follow- up activities are reco mmen ded. Seminars for suicide awar eness wer e con- ducted in Creston, Council Bluffs, Iowa City , and Cedar Rapids. Staff fr om Foundation 2 i n Cedar Rapids spoke at these programs, which were sponsored b y local co mmunity colleges, Area Education Agencies, and local schools.

Interest has i ncreas ed among advocac y groups t o rejuvenate th e Governor's Chi ldren's Cabinet, recognizes the uni que needs of financ- ing children' s services and the difficulty in shar- ing a visio n for Iowa's Chi ldren. National Goal #2. Mental health care is consumer and family -driven. Consumer involvem ent has raised such key issues as transportation, h ousing, em ployment, and self-direc tion in this and other state-level discussions about t he needs of adults with m en- tal illness. The Mental Health, Mental Retardatio n, De- velopm ental Disabilities, and Brain Injury Commission within the Iowa Depart ment of Human Services is rede signing the sy stem of care for adults with mental health needs. The Commission subm itted a report to Gove rnor Tom Vilsack and the Iowa General A ssembly in January 2004 and contin ues to plan for i mple- mentation through ongoing work gro ups. Adults who are consumers of mental health ser vices are represented on the comm ission and the work groups The Mental Health, Mental Retardatio n, De- velopm ental Disabilities, and Brain Injury Commission and the Iowa Department of Hu- man Services launched the kick-off for t he Chil- dren's S ystem Redesign on October 21, 2004, with a conference, \"Touch the Lives of Chil- dren.\" Over 300 people attended, a hig h per- centage of which were parents and fam ily mem bers of children with disabilities attending. The Mental Health, Mental Retardatio n, De- velopm ental Disabilities, and Brain Injury Commission also required that parents or fam ily mem bers of children with disabilities represent 50% of the C hildren's Disabilit y Committee, which is beginning to desi gn the childre n's sys- tem. Families and consumers re present 50% of the Iowa Mental Health Planning and Ad visor y Council, whi ch reviews an d monitors the annual federal Co mmunity Mental Health Ser vices Per- formance Partnership Block Grant and S tate Plan. Magellan He alth Services established a Children's M ental Health Roundtable, which initiated a 4- year study of the system s currently in place for delivering m ental health ser vices to children in Io wa. That work resulted in t he pub- lication of a fa mily resource directory in col- laboration wit h the Substance Alliance for Men- tally Ill (NAMI) Iowa. Over 10,000 directories were distributed to schools and m ental h ealth providers across the state. The Iowa Departm ent of Education is in - volving fam ilies in meetin g the developmental needs of children with dis abilities: 1. The statewide Parent Education Connec- tion (PEC) em ploys over 35 parents of children with disabiliti es to work with parents tr ying to meet the a cademic and behavioral needs of their children. Ov er 500 parent s and educators attend a PEC annual conference where they network and discuss issues affe cting students with dis- abilities. PEC and the Parent Training and In- formation (PTI) Center work closely together to address issue s associ ated with behavior. In re- cent y ears, behavior has consistently been among the top five reasons spurring i ndividuals to consult wit h the AEA. PEC and the PTI Cen- ter conducted a Parent Summit that brou ght to- gether statewide parent gro ups to networ k, cre- April 2005 Chap ter 1 2 Page 5 of 26 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Mental Health & Mental Disorders ate co mmon goals, and share infor mation. PEC also creat ed a \"Parents as P resenters \" directory which lists parents who can present at Institutes of Higher Education, comm unity agencies, and civic groups on issues for children with disabili- ties. 2. Parents of children with dis abilities rep- resent 50% of the Special Education Advisory Panel (SEAP). SEAP reviews and monitors state government activities related to im plemen- tation of t he Individuals with Disabilities Educa- tion Act (IDEA). 3. The Iowa Behavioral Alliance is respon- sible for three dom ains: mental health, dropo ut prevention, a nd positive behavioral supports. Each domain includes parent participatio n and leadership. Parents repres ent 90% of a Fa mily Assist ance Te am, which wa s formed to assist schools across the state with includi ng parents in school-wide behavioral assistance teams and to support t he work of t he Iowa Behavioral Alli- ance. The Iowa Collaboration for Youth Devel- opment (ICYD) coalition was formed to focus on positive youth development and youth in- volvem ent. This collaboration in volves t he Iowa Depart ment of Hu man Ser vices, the Iowa De- partm ent of Public Health, the Iowa Dep artment of Education, Workforce Development, the Of- fice of Drug Control Polic y (ODCP), and com - munity partne rs that work with youth. The Coa- lition funded projects in several co mmunities that focus on developing youth i nvolvement. The Iowa De partment of Hu man Services created an ad visory board of current and form er foster care y outh. National Goal #3. Disparities in men- tal health services are eliminated. Peer counseling and phone support hotlines has proven to be an effective way of li nking older adults to assistanc e during crises. These services may also prolong the tenure of older adults in comm unities. A state wide study of hom elessnes s was con- ducted in 1999 by Iowa State University and reported a tot al of 26, 298 homeless people in Iowa. Apply ing the prevalence of psy chiatric disorders to this population, the estimat ed num - ber of hom eless persons with m ental or em o-tional disorde rs requiring professional help ranges fro m 6,600 t o 14,650. According to the study regarding hom eless persons: 72% are lo- cated in the large metropolitan counties, 50% are male, and 50% are f emale; 55% are under aged 18; 7 0% are white; and 90 % are non-Hispanic. Another state wide study of hom elessnes s is be- ing com pleted in 2 005. The case management sy stem for older Io- wans facilitat ed the efficient use of comm unity - based resourc es for the trea tment of the phy sical and m ental h ealth problems in this po pulation. The safety and treat ment capacity in the Iowa prison sy stem was increas ed by adding beds for m ental health inmates at the Fort Madi- son Penitenti ary and a female unit at the Mount Pleasant Corr ectional Facil ity. These projects provide 300 s pecial-needs beds for inm ates. National Goal #4. Early mental he alth screening, assessment and referral to services are common practices. The Early Child Care and Education Net- work witness ed an increasi ng focus and interest in the area of child care and early education. Governor Vilsack turned his focus to prom oting the reco mmendations of t he Iowa Learn s Coun- cil on early care and education. T he Early Child Care and Education Netw ork consists of Child Care Resource and Refe rral of Iowa, Iowa Pro- gram for Infant and To ddler Caregivers, the Iowa Fam ily Resource Net work (IFRN), Iowa Respite and Crisis Care Coalition, Prevent Child Abuse Iowa, and Parents Anon ymous of Iowa Inc. Early ch ildhoo d stakeholders, inclu ding the Network and a broad cross section of pro fes- sionals in the early care, health and educ ation fields, are wo rking to build a co mprehensive early child hood system by expanding program - ming and advocacy on behalf of young c hildren. Early ACCESS is a partnership between families with young childre n, birth to age three, and prov iders from the Iowa Departments of Education , Public Health , Human Services , and Child Health Specialty Clinics. The pur pose of this program is for fam ilies and staff to work together to id entify, coordi nate and prov ide needed services and resources that will help the family assist their infant or toddler to grow and Chap ter 1 2 Page 6 of 26 April 2005 Mental Health & Mental Disorders HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision develop. T he fam ily and providers work to- gether to identify and addre ss specifi c family concerns and priorities as they relate to the child' s overall growth and developm ent. In ad- dition, broade r fam ily need s and concerns can be addressed by locating other supporti ve and re- sources servi ces in the local co mmunity for the family and/or child. All services to the child are provided in the child' s natural environ ment, in- cluding t he home and other co mmunity settings where children of the same age without disabili- ties participat e. A state wide c ommittee, A ssuring Better Child Health and Development II (ABCD II), was formed to supp ort the Medicaid Early and Periodic Scre ening, Diagnosis and Treat ment program (EPSTD) under t he direction o f the Iowa Department of Publi c Health. The co m- mittee's purp ose is to make behavioral health services avail able to all children from birth through age three. Commi ttee members meet monthly and are in a planning phase. An im - plementation phase is expected to begin in 2005. National Goal #5. Excellent mental health care is delivered and research is accelerated. A Technical Assist ance C enter for Evi- dence-Bas ed Practice s in Mental Healt h is de- veloping through a partner ship of the I owa Con- sortium for Mental Healt h and Magellan Health Services, contractor for Iowa' s Medicai d behav- ioral health services and the Iowa Depar tment of Human Services. The tech nical assist ance cen- ter focused on two evidence-bas ed practices: a Wellness and Recovery Center and Asse rtive Community Treatment Centers. It has devel- oped capabilities to increas e training regarding these practic es across the st ate. Technolog y improved in Iowa's 12 Chi ld Health Specia lty Clinics that allows ac cess of \"best practic es\" in the m ost rural clinics. This partnership is between the Iowa Department of Human Services, the Iowa Depart ment of Public Health, and Magellan He alth Services. The Center for Develop ment and Disabili- ties of the University of Iowa rec eived resear ch fundin g for partnering with the Iowa Departm ent of Education to cond uct a statewide project for children aged birth to six w ith developm ental disabilities. The project teaches parents and primary caregivers specific strategies on how to effectively manage their child' s aggressive and self-injurious behavior. Th e treatment is deliv- ered in the child' s home, and the data indicates not o nly a high level of satisfaction b y parents but also a reduction in out-of-hom e placem ents. Legislation passed in the 2004 session (SF2288) mandates that monies from the Com- munity Ment al Health Blo ck Grant prog ram be used for \"evidence-based practices. \" This spurred the development of a new process of soliciting, dis tributin g and monitoring th e use of block grant f unds, with an increased emphasis on ensuring that program s funded t hrough this mechanis m are delivered in a manner co nsistent with an evidence-based cul ture. National Goal #6. Tec hnolog y is used to collect uniform mental health data. Funding incre ased for early childhood pr o- gram s through the Em powerm ent Initiat ive, Early ACCESS, and ABCD II grants, all of which provi de resources to support uniformity across all dat a sources. The Iowa De partment of Hu man Services received the Data Infrastru cture Grant ( DIG) to enhance collection of u niform data about mental health service s across the st ate. Goals & Action Statements Cultural competence is a fundam ental com - ponent of each goal in this chapter. Achieving cultural com petence is pres umed ess ential to the succes sful com pletion of each goal and action step. Therefore, there will not be a conti nual referenc e made to cultural competence i n the narrative of the goals and action steps. National Goal #1. Iowans understand that mental health is essential to overall health. April 2005 Chap ter 1 2 Page 7 of 26 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Mental Health & Mental Disorders 121 Goal Statement Develop a statew ide campaign to in- crease public a wareness about the need for good mental health through media, community leaders, and schools. Base- line: See Rationale. Rationale Iowa has 99 counties and 9 48 incor porated municipalities ranging in size fro m Beac onsfield n 11) to Des Mo ines (populati on 198,652). Persons experiencing m ental health problem s may seek assist ance fro m a va riety of public and private organizations in these co m- munities, all of which need to be kept u p-to-date on new practices and interventions. Human servic es agencie s, law enforce ment organizations, fam ilies, an d others need to be awar e of current trends in mental health ser- vices, including the national focus on family - centered and self-directed services in order to prom ote a high level of co mmunity resp onsive- ness to mental health needs. The local Central Point of Coordination position for adult s ervices is a \"gate-keeper\" for fundi ng resources but is not necessaril y mental health inform ation spe- cialist about sy mptoms, best practice treatm ents, and local services that are available. 121.1 Action Step By 2007, diss eminate written material s about m ental health disord ers of adults and chil- dren to each Iowa State Un iversity Extension office. The extension offic es will distribute these materials to comm unity health providers, schools and f aith communities. (A National Al- liance for Mentally Ill Iow a and Iowa State Uni- versity Extension Service action step.) 121.2 Action Step By 2007, ide ntify an in-se rvice module for cross-training different licensed professionals and staff about m ental health disorders, includ- ing s ymptoms and treatm ents. This trai ning module will be appropriate for in-services and conference workshops hel d by professional as- sociations, ju dges, law enforcem ent personnel, educators, and polic ymakers. (A National Alli-ance of Mentally Ill Iowa and professional asso- ciations' action step.) 121.3 Action Step By 2010, ide ntify five pre- service education program s in i nstitutes of hi gher education in the areas of soci al work, ps ychology, public health, elementary education, and special educ ation. Review the c ore curricula require ments for each program with the curriculum director and en- courage integration of m ental health awa reness, including s ymptoms and treat ments. (A Special- ized Services Group, Iowa Depart ment of Edu- cation, Iowa Association of Independent Col- leges and Universities, stat e universities, and National Ass ociation of Social Workers action step.) 122 Goal Statement Reduce b y 10% the an nual incidence of suicides among youth aged 15 to 24 and adults over aged 65. Baseli ne: See 2001 rates. Rationale In 2001, 30,622 suicides were co mmitted in the United St ates. Of those, 17.6% were over aged 65 and 13.0% were ag ed 15 to 24. The greatest need for suicide pr evention is am ong teenagers and young adults , for whom suicide is the second leading cause of death in Iow a. Males co mmitted 86% of s uicides in this age group. Suici de rates are also high am ong the elderly , but ra nks behind many other causes of death for this group. In I owa, the percent of sui- cides co mmit ted by 15 to 24-year-olds has been greater than the national average in rec ent years. For instance, 15 to 24-year-olds commit ted 19.4% of the 304 t otal Iowa suicides in 2001 , and those ove r aged 65 committed 16.4%. Of the 312 t otal Iowa suicides in 20 02, the 15 to 24 age group committed 17% and those over aged 65 comm itted 14.4%. The literature on suicide indicates that depression and substance abuse are the two main risk factors for suicide, while firear ms are t he leading lethal means of carry ing out the act.

(An Iowa Department of Pu blic Health and National Alliance for Mentally Ill Iowa action step.) 122.2 Action Step By 2010, incr ease public awareness of sui- cide risk fact ors and prevention strategies by preparing a list of boo ks and other resources on these topics for public, pri vate and school librar- ies. (An Iowa Department of Public He alth and National Alliance for Mentally Ill Iowa action step.) 122.3 Action Step Beginning i n 2005 , work w ith television, radio and ne wspaper media to regularl y inform the public about the risk fa ctors associ ated with suicide. (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health action step.) 122.4 Action Step By 2010, conduct education and awareness forum s for the geographic areas having the high- est incidence of suicide during the m ost recent years for which data are av ailable. (An Iowa Department of Public Health and Magell an Health Servic es action step .) 122.5 Action Step By 2007, strengthen the state' s resources for preventing suicide by increasing the num ber of those qualified to train serv ice providers on sui- cide intervention to pics, in cluding ed ucation and mental health . (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health and Magellan Healt h Services act ion step.) 122.6 Action Step By 2009, ide ntify a program to train em- ployers to recognize signs of suicide in youn g adults, especi ally in m ales outside higher educa- tional s ystems, and identif y a m odel emplo yee assist ance program to meet the needs of young adults. (An I owa Depart ment of Publ ic Health action step.) April 2005 Chap ter 1 2 Page 9 of 26 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Mental Health & Mental Disorders 123 Goal Statement Increase the number of mental health assessments performe d by primary care physicians as part of routine patient care. Baseli ne: To be est ablished thro ugh an upcoming survey, along with a spe cific im- provem ent target. Rationale Persons experiencing m ental health prob - lems or problem s with emotional well-b eing fre- quentl y have ph ysical health prob lems as well. They often seek and receive treat ment for phy si- cal illnesses f rom a primary care provider. In many cases, only the phy sical ail ment is treated and the m ental and/or em otional illness may not be dealt with or even recognized. The result is that appropria te mental health treat ment within the prim ary care setting or referral to a mental health professional for further evaluation and treatment is not m ade. National data ind icates that one-half to two-thirds of those who commit suicide have visited a phy sician within one month prior t o the suicide. According to the National Institute of Health Epidem iology Catch ment Area Study , recent psychiatric illness wa s 41% higher, and lifeti me psychiatric di sorder was 28% higher, in patients who also were medically ill. As cited in the 2003 Institute of Medicine publication e ntitled Priority Area s for National Action (pp. 74 -75), only 50% of depressed pat ients in the commu- nity and in primary medical settings are cor- rectly diagnosed, and less than one-third of them receive adequ ate therapy for their depression. Both rates of treatment and national health ex- penditures for depression are substantially lower than corresponding levels for many other chronic and disabling disorders. Patients with unrecognized depression con- stitute up to 30% of those seen by prim ary care providers. The result is unnecess ary treat ment of secondary medical illnesses, use of unneces- sary prescription m edicatio n, and unnecessary continued use of prim ary care services. By pro- viding prim ary care provid ers with training o n the detection and treatm ent of m ental health is- sues and the developm ent of collaborative rela- tionships wit h mental health care professionals, patients can be appropriately treated, allowing for elim inatio n of wasted health care dollars. As saf er and m ore easily prescribed families of antidepressants beco me available, tre atment for depression within the pri mary care setting is beco ming increasingly widespread, along with the expectation that on ly the more unusual or difficult cases will be referr ed to m ental health specialist s. In those situations that do require referral to a s pecialist, primary care providers are faced with two fun damental problems: 1) not correctly identify ing when a patients is in need of further m ental health evaluation and t reat- ment; and 2) not correctl y connecting su ch a patient to specialized mental health services that are both appropriate and acces sible. Inadequate training of othe r support persons on issues surroundi ng m ental health treatment also adds to the problem . By training these groups o n the issues surrounding mental health evaluation and referral, consumers will have the opport unity to obtain quali ty mental health care in a tim ely fashion. T here will also be substan- tial savings in other areas of health care. 123.1 Action Step By 2008, con duct and p ublish a statewid e survey of primary care phy sicians that identifies barriers to the integration o f behavioral h ealth and prim ary care. (An A merican Ac ademy of Family Physicians action step.) 123.2 Action Step By 2009, ens ure that primary care phy si- cians, nurse practitioners, and phy sician assis- tants receive special traini ng and reference in- formation that addresses th e need for appropriate mental health referrals and the need to incorpo- rate a collaborative consumer/family perspective into the m ental health diagnosis, treatm ent and referral process. (An Iowa Consortium for Men- tal Health Ser vices Training and Resear ch and the associatio ns of prim ary care providers action step.) 123.3 Action Step By 2007, dev elop and distr ibute \"toolki ts\" for prim ary care phy sicians, nurse practitioners, and phy sician assistants tha t include the Medi- caid-approved m ental health screening tool for Chap ter 1 2 Page 10 of 2 6 April 2005 Mental Health & Mental Disorders HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision youn g childre n (throu gh Iowa's Early , Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment program ) and the functional asses sment tool identified by the Mental Health, Mental Retardation, Devel- opmental Di sabilities, and Brain Injur y Com- mission and a directory of community mental health service provi ders. (A Magellan Health Services, Iow a Depart ment of Public He alth, and Iowa Depart ment of Hu man Services a ction step.) 124 Goal Statement Improve the overall efficienc y of child- serving state agencies b y creatin g a shared state level visi on for improving the well-bei ng of children from earl y childhood through adult transition mod- eled after the Earl y ACCESS collabora- tive planning format. Baseli ne: A state-level shared visi on does n ot exist at this time among state age ncies. Rationale Many children diagnosed with a Severe Emotional Disorder (SED) and their families receive s ervices fro m a vari ety of public and private agencies. No single public or private agency has the financial or technical reso urces to provide all co mponents of care on its own. Due to the variety of sy stem s that provide care for children, the various levels of involvem ent of families, and the variety of definitions and scopes of practice for \"c ase-manage ment\" among provi ders, collaborative agreements among state agencies is essential to begi n uni- form ity among sy stem s. Agencies must braid their financial and personne l resources to avoid duplication of effort, gaps i n service, and other detriments to the effective and efficient use of the scarc e mental health resources avail able to children and their fa milies. 124.1 Action Step By 2006, each state agency will endors e one statewide st andard functional asse ssment tool for children with Serious Em otional Disorder (SED) to be used at all points of e ntry, regardle ss of setting. (An I owa Depart ment of Publ ic Health, Iowa Department of Education, and I owa De- partment of Hu man Services, EPSDT, and Men- tal Health, Mental Retardat ion, Developmental Disabilities, and Brain Injury Commissi on ac- tion step.) 124.2 Action Step In 2005, conti nue to facilitate shared staffing and financial resources to meet the co mplex needs of children and their fa milies by reestab- lishing the G overnor 's Chi ldren's Cabin et. (A Governor's C hildren 's Cabinet action step.) 124.3 Action Step By 2006, endorse an interagency collabora- tive that addresse s the mental health needs of children aged 5 thro ugh 18 modeled after the Early Chil dhood Collab orative Plannin g for Birth to age fi ve. (A Governor 's Childre n's Cabinet action step.) 124.4 Action Step By 2005, create an inventor y of all state ini- tiatives affe cting m ental he alth services f or chil- dren and how the y interface. (A Mental Health, Mental Retardation, Developm ental Di sabilities, and Brain Inj ury Comm ission action step.) National Goal #2. M ental health care is consumer and family-driven. 125 Goal Statement Increase to 100 % the n umber of mental health service agencies that include some form of consumer and famil y input when desig ning or modify ing the ser- vices the y deliver. Baseline: The pe rcent- age of these agen cies incorpo rate custome r input is unkno wn, but presume d to be very low. Rationale Throug h the i nvolvem ent of those who d i- rectly benefit from mental health service s, Iowa creates a responsive s ystem for the recruitm ent, training and r elevant input from consumer par- ticipants. Strengthening the role of consumers April 2005 Chap ter 1 2 Page 11 of 2 6 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Mental Health & Mental Disorders further provides a foru m to advocate for an im - proved arra y of services, including case man- agement, outpatient therapy, residential services, enhanced trea tment options , cultural competency training, and ongoi ng staff developm ent. While consumers may or may not prom ote a sp ecific model or product, the y are sure to advoc ate for age-appropriate opport unities such wrap-around servi ces and co mmunity linkages with other services, including client education and community support . 125.1 Action Step By 2005, form a stat ewide mental healt h consumer, family and youth council to identify barriers and c oncerns within the adult and chil- dren' s mental health sy stems and inform policy makers of bes t practice ser vice alternati ves available to address the m. (A Magellan Health Services and Medicaid Waiver Advisor y Coun- cils [Ill and Handicapped, Personal Assistance Services, etc. ] action step.) 125.2 Action Step By 2007, usi ng a train-the -trainer model, educate consumers about the management of their mental health conditions, includi ng the im - portance of proper medicat ion, diet, exercise, and other aspects of wellne ss. (A Wellness Managem ent and Recovery Technical Assis- tance Center action step.) 125.3 Action Step By 2008, dev elop and sup port an infrastruc- ture for traini ng peer support specialists, which includes adopting a curriculum and core compe- tencies for a peer support specialist, as well as a credentialing and quality assurance proce ss. (A Wellness Ma nage ment and Recovery Technical Assist ance C enter action step.) 125.4 Action Step By 2010, certify at least one peer support specialist in e very comm unity m ental he alth center or other mental health service provider who can prov ide age-appropriate information and referral t o link consumers to servi ces and follow-up activities such as: job training, af- fordable hous ing, fo od an d pharmacy assistance, healthy leisure ti me events, and substance abuse free events. ( A Wellness Manage ment and Re- covery Technical As sistanc e Center actio n step.) 126 Goal Statement Increase to 100 % the n umber of mental health service agencies that include some form of youth an d famil y input when desig ning or modify ing chil d and adolescent services. Baseli ne: The per- centa ge of these a gencies that currently incor- porate youth and family input is un known, but presumed to be very low. Rationale A framework for an extended array of roles for youth and fam ily members in relation to leg- islators, planners, those who fun d programs, pri- vate and publ ic child-serving s ystems, and di- rect-care staff m ust take into account the strengths, resources and stresses of yout h and their fa milies. Parents and fa mily members have an acute knowledge and awarene ss of s ervice needs associ ated with the stresse s and re wards of living with a child with special needs. This unique perspective can lead to developm ent of supportive se rvices such as counseling a nd par- ent-lead support grou ps, as well as more con- crete s ervices such as respi te care, re creational opport unities, and financial assistance. 126.1 Action Step By 2007, increase par ent and fam ily leader- ship b y 20% to expand opportunities for family choice of what, how and where services will be delivered in t he designing and im plementation of a sy stem of care at the l ocal, state an d re- gional levels. (A Mental Health, Mental Retar- dation, Developm ental Di sabilities, and Brain Injur y Commission and M agellan Health Ser- vices action s tep) 126.2 Action Step By 2007, ide ntify training curricula for par- ents and fam ilies of children and youth with se- rious em otional disorders.

(An Iowa Collabo- ration for Yo uth Develop ment action step.) 127 Goal Statement Identify and serve children and youth in the juvenile justice s ystem b y develop- ing an integrated community -based men- tal health service delivery model a nd ex- amine the effectiveness of that model. Baselin e: Such a mod el has not be en imple- mented on a statewi de ba sis. Rationale Crim inal careers usually begin d uring the juvenile years. Most chroni c offenders have multiple contacts with the juvenile justice sy s- tem. Approxi mately 30% to 40% of all youth growing up in urban areas in the United States will be arrest ed before their 18th birthda y. Each successive arr est will place them at higher risk. After five or six arrests, they will have a better than 90% chance of being arrested again . Some y outh a dvocates ass ert that all but a handful of youths are best served by pla cing them in small, community -based programs. A number of studies have dem onstrated that ap- propriate comm unity -based interventions work considerably better than regular probati on or short-term detention. 127.1 Action Step By 2007, establish assess ment centers for youth in the juvenile justice sy stem to provide community -based intake, s creening, ass essment, case management, and wrap-around services.

(A Mental Health, Mental Retardation, Devel- opmental Di sabilities, and Brain Injur y Com- mission actio n step.) 127.4 Action Step By 2008, trai n juvenile co urt jud ges and of- ficers on the rationale for k eeping child and ado- lescent offen ders with mental health disorders in their own co mmunities, and o n how t o use the array of court orders available to them to ac- complish this. (A local Departm ent of Hu man Services and juvenile court judges action step.) 12-8 Goal Statement Expand b y 30% the ca pacity to se rve adult offenders in Iowa state correctional facilities and under community supervi- sion. Baseli ne: See Rationale. Rationale Iowa has experienced a tremendous increase in its prison i nmate population in recent y ears. Approxim ately 15% of th ose inmates have co- occurring substance abuse and m ental h ealth disorders. Due to the risin g num ber of offenders and the dim inishing n umber of comm unity m en- tal health care placement options, it is vital that the Iowa Dep artment of Corrections, commu- nity-based corrections, and communities act in April 2005 Chap ter 1 2 Page 13 of 2 6 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Mental Health & Mental Disorders the short-term to expand services st atewide for offenders with m ental health disorders and de- velopm ental disabilities. 128.1 Action Step By 2007, increase the bed c apacity by 170 to treat offenders with mental disorders within the correctional sy stem . Additional beds are being added at the Iowa Medical and Classific ation Center at Oak dale. At this time, the state wide system is capable of providing adequate mental health services to approxim ately 544 of the 8,500 inm ates. (An Iowa Department of Correc- tions and Iow a Depart ment of Hum an Services action step.) 128.2 Action Step By 2007, address the lack of fundi ng for offenders moving to community -based correc- tional pro grams. There are 76 offender s in community -based correctio nal program s who receive menta l health services out of a total of 1,515 in the state.

(An I owa Department of Corrections, Iowa Department of Human Services, and centr al point of coordina- tion action st ep.) 128.4 Action Step By 2005, increase state app ropriations for the Iowa Dep artment of Corrections and co m- munity -based corrections to effectively and con- stitutionall y manage the mental health needs of offenders. (A legislative ac tion step.) 129 Goal Statement Provide housing for 100 % of kno wn chronicall y homeless children and adults with mental health disorders. Basel ine: See Ration ale. Rationale Although homelessness is not a new ph e- nomenon, recent dem ograp hic and econo mic changes have interacted wi th the effects of de- institutionaliz ation of the m entally ill in the y to produce a num erically signifi cant populati on wi th serious and persistent mental illnesses and highly specialized service n eeds. Data show that: 1) the num ber of hom eless peo- ple is growing steadily ; 2) the average a ge of homeless peo ple is droppi ng sharpl y; and 3) the percentage of those who are chronically men- tally ill, by any definitio n, is increasing rapidly . There are s erious problems associat ed with services to the hom eless who are mental ly ill. These individuals require an intricate array of coordinated h ousing, psychiatric, medical, so- cial, rehabilitative, vocational, and transportation services. The se needs must be met in a com pre- hensive manner and throu gh a single enti ty re- sponsible for coordinating t he needed ser vices and supports in the comm unity. Current ly, ser- vices are extr emely fragme nted and there is no clear delineat ion of responsibilit y. Programs for the hom eless who are mentally ill must inclu de an effective goal setting process. Goals must be precise, re asonable and consistent with their needs and resources. Co mmunity re- sources must be allocated through interagency planning and coordination of services an d in a manner that recognizes the diverse individual needs of thos e being served with respect to their age, gender, rural and urba n differentiation, race, culture, ethnicity , and belief sy stem . 129.1 Action Step By 2008, create 1,000 new housing opportu- nities in comm unity settings and expand com - munity living opportunities for people wi th dis- abilities throughout the state.

(An Io wa Department of Human Services and Iowa Finance Authority action step.) 1210 Goal Statement Design and implement a s ystem of care for adults w ith mental health needs. Baseline: This system is currently in the desig n phase; se e Rationale. Rationale The current sy stem of care for adults is both fragmented and u ncoordi nated. To remedy this, the state must empower an d provide adequate staff and ad ministrative capabilities for a cen- tralized focus of responsibi lity within sta te gov- ernment that would be responsible for i dentify- ing and unifying all available mental health- related services and suppor ts. There is a need to for inter-state agency colla boration t o qualify for federal funds (e.g., co-occurring, m ental health and substance abuse issues) . 1210.1 Action Step By 2008, establish within s tate government a clear focal point f or administration of adult mental health services, incl uding count y ser- vices, Medicaid disability services, and Medi- caid behavioral health services, with ade quate staffing for in teragency planning and co ordina- tion of m ental health services for adults.

Baseline: This system is cur- rently in the desig n stag e; see Ration ale. Rationale Responsibilities for planning, funding, regu- lating, and ad minister ing developmental and behavioral services for children and adolescents are not vested in a single entity . Instead, they are diffused throug hout a number of state agen- cies, Depart ment of Hu man Services: child welfar e, co mmunity mental health centers, de- categorizatio n boards, in novation zo nes, em - powerm ent zones, and the Division of Medical April 2005 Chap ter 1 2 Page 15 of 2 6 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Mental Health & Mental Disorders Services whic h serves as th e State Medic aid Au- thorit y including Medicaid Home and Commu- nity Based Services Waiver s and behavioral health.

Iowa Department of Publi c Health: Child Health Specialty Clinics housed within t he Uni- versity of Iowa, ABCDII Program ; as outlined in Chapter 11, Division of B ehavioral Health and Professional Licensure' s prevention and licens- ing auth ority. Iowa Department of Inspections and Ap - peals: Psy chiatric Medical Institutes for Chil- dren (PMIC). Iowa Department of Hu man Rights: Crim i- nal and Juven ile Justice Planning (CJJP). These entities, including the Governor' s De- velopm ental Disabilities Council, are g, adm inistering, and regulat- ing children's services in Iowa. However , these functions are not well integrated, but instead are vaguely diffused across state agencies, d epart- ments, divisions, bureaus, and commissions, with some overlap in responsibilities. It is the state's responsibility to spearhead the process of engaging fa mily members, public and private agencies, advocates, providers, and state and loca l officials to collaboratively estab- lish and im plement an inte grated sy stem of care. To help realize such a vision, the state must es- tablish and adequately staff a centralized focus of responsibil ity within stat e governm ent to blend all available services and supp orts for children, adolescents and their fam ilies who re- ceive services from publicly funded system s. 1211.1 Action Step By 2006, propose a focal point for t he ad- ministration of children's mental health services within state governm ent with responsibil ity and adequate staff ing for in teragency planni ng and coordination of mental health wrap-around ser- vices for children, youth, a nd their fam ilies.

Disparities in mental health services are eliminated. 1212 Goal Statement In accordance with cu lturall y sensitive practices, provide appropriate mental health services to all a dults and children seeking services. Basel ine: See Rationale. Rationale Providing culturally com petent services i s a major challen ge facing me ntal health service providers. To address this disparity , the action steps related to this goal i nvolve creating a m i- norit y advisor y grou p, con vening an inter - agency committee, and recr uiting, training and retaining ps ychiatrists and behavioral health pro- fessionals fro m divers e cul tures and back- groun ds. Chap ter 1 2 Page 16 of 2 6 April 2005 Mental Health & Mental Disorders HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision 1212.1 Action Step In 200 5, form a minorit y advisor y group to develop a training track for the 200 6 ann ual mental health training conference.

(A College of Public Health action step.) 1212.3 Action Step By 2008, convene an inter-agency commit- tee to identif y unm et needs of populations with mental health needs and develop strategies to meet thes e needs. (An Iowa Mental Hea lth Planning an d Advisor y Council action step.) 1213 Goal Statement Provide affordable public transportation that is frequent enough to support an independent lifesty le for all persons with mental health disorders who are transit dependent. Baseli ne: Although some level of publi c transit servi ce is currently provid ed in counties, the sched ule an d/or geog raphic cove r- age be suffici ent for pe rsons with men- tal disabilities, especially in rural counties. Eligi- bility restri ctions of the transit system s are also probl em in so me are as. Rationale Iowa's urban and regional public transit sys- tems are required to be o pen to the publi c, al- thoug h many of the rural s ystems continu e to be perceived as serving onl y persons with devel- opmental disabilities or older persons, but not those with mental illness. Also, in m ost rural areas the li mited public and private transporta- tion services run only on c ertain day s, and then only durin g daytime hours. Indivi duals needing transportation are, therefore, stranded dur ing much of the week, creating a feeling of isolation and lim iting the following activities: 1) getting to work; 2) at religi ous services; 3) par- ticipating in s ocial or recreational activities; and 6) utilizing drop-in centers or club houses. Transportation contin ues to be an obsta cle to the delivery of mental healt h services, pa rticu- larly for thos e suffering from serious and persis- tent conditions. Both inter- and intra-city public transportation continues to disappear, which has a heavy impact on low-inc ome consu mers who find it difficult or im possible to acces s key ser- vices becaus e of the lack of reliable and afford- able transportation. There are many people with serious mental illness who are in desperate need of depe ndable transportation. Not being a ble to drive m akes them dependent on others o r, worse y et, prevents then from venturing out at all. As is true for most people, having adequ ate transportation provides this populati on wi th a feeling of inde- pendence and contributes t o overall m ental and physical health and well-being. 1213.1 Action Step By 2005, pre pare a report docum enting ad- ditional sourc es of fundin g that public tra nsit systems can use to expand services for a ll per- sons and to underwrite ser vices for pers ons with mental health disorders. (A state-l evel Trans- portation Co ordination Co uncil, Iowa Depart- ment of Publi c Health, and Iowa Department of Transportation action step. ) 1213.2 Action Step By 2006, provide training and technical as- sistance to public transit system personnel on accessing mental health funding programs for the transportation of person s with mental health disorders. (A state-level Tr ansportation Coordi- nation Cou ncil, Iowa Departm ent of Pub lic Health, and Iowa Department of Transp ortation action step.) 1213.3 Action Step By 2005, establish a m onitoring an d rep ort- ing s ystem to assure co mpliance with \"open to the public\" requirements for public transit ser- April 2005 Chap ter 1 2 Page 17 of 2 6 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Mental Health & Mental Disorders vices in Iowa.

Baselin e: make this mental h ealth out- reach servi ce available. SFY 2004 - M ental Health Outreach , Unmet Need s Report, Iowa Dep artment of Elder Affairs Grayed Area Co des: NP - No Pr ovider Avail able NF - No Funding Source NS - U nable to Staff Nu mber of Ho urs FI Funding Source Inadequ ate Cover Costs Rationale More than 20 % of the Iowa populatio n is currently over aged 60. F our percent is aged 85 and older, wit h 50% of th is group housed in congregate living en viron ments. Older adults often have special mental health needs. This populati on ha s traditionall y been underserved or completely without access to services due to: geographic isolation; the stigma associ ated with mental illness and the subs equent reluctance to seek treat ment; the allocation of m ental health resources to other age groups; the lack of appro-priately traine d professionals to meet unique needs of olde r patients; a lack of approp ternative and over reliance on institutionaliz ation, rather than community based services, f or treat- ment. Case manage ment services covered by the Medicaid Elderly Waiver are avail able in 99 counties, with 12, 500 Iowans over aged 65 re- ceiving such services in 2004. There are cur rently few medical and ps ychi- atric professi onals in Iowa with geriatric train- ing.

Early mental health screening, assessment and referral to services are common practice. 1215 Goal Statement Ensure universal access to social, emo- tional and behavioral health services for children aged birth to five. Baseline: Uni- versal a ccess is not cu rrently available in every Iowa community. Rationale The commit ment to young children in Iowa is that \"Every child, begi nning at birt h, will be healthy and s uccess ful.\" In order to accom plish this goal, a com prehensive systems approach will be required. Iowa's mental health care sy s- tem for children is frag mented, with scar ce re- sources and no poi nt of accountabilit y to serve children and their fa milies i n need. Fam ily sup- port and parent education s ervices vary in com - prehensiveness and accessi bility . For mental health, there is a need to facilitate linking initia- tives, potential partners, a nd resources for a co- ordinated, com prehensive system of car e. There is a need to establish a single point of a ccess throug h culti vating ke y champions, developing advocacy skills, disse minating best practices, and form ulating a sustainabilit y plan for imple- menting Iowa's plan f or early childh ood.

Base- line: Data and a specific i mprovem ent target will be esta blishe d usin g the re sults of a fort hcomi ng survey. Rationale Maternal mental health difficulties are a sig- nificant publi c health probl em that negatively impacts the i ndividual woman, as w ell as her children and partner. The full range of mental illnesses af fects wo men during pregnanc y and the postpartu m period, fro m psychosis to anxiet y and depression. Depression, especially in child- bearing women, is commo n and affects 10% to 15% of women durin g pre gnanc y t he post- partum perio d. Previous surve ys indicate in Iowa experi- ence depressi ve sy mptoms at least a s often and that these sym ptoms are more common in lower income wo men. Lower inco me women also have m ore difficulties acc essing treat ment. Mental illness, more specif ically depression, can have an effect on the full range of s pheres of life of these wo men. Dep ression during preg- nancy is associated with increas ed risk for lower birth weight a nd preterm delivery ; poorer mater- nal health practices su ch as sm oking, alcohol and drug use; and decrease d prenatal care. Post- partum depression is know n to have a ne gative impact on parenting and su bsequent beh avioral and cogniti ve developm ent in the infant/ child. 1216.1 Action Step By 2007, in c ollaboration with health insti- tutions, i dentify opportuniti es to survey partici- pants in ot her program s to establish a set of baseline data for maternal depression.

Excellent mental health care is delivered and research is accelerated. 1217 Goal Statement In accordance with es tablished best practices, provide excellent mental health services in rural and urban set- tings. Basel ine: See Rationale. Rationale Making com prehensive and high qualit y mental health services av ailable is an ongoing process. Li mited levels of accessibility are a major challen ge facing persons seeking mental health services. Recognizing the need f or im- provin g or ad ding m ental health coverage to pri- vate health insurance policies would help equal- ize the quality and availabilit y of m ental health services. 1217.1 Action Step By 2005, ena ct full mental health insurance parity legislation no later than the 2005 s ession of the Iowa General As sembly .

April 2005 Chap ter 1 2 Page 21 of 2 6 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Mental Health & Mental Disorders 1218 Goal Statement Develop a process to influence state public polic y developm ent, planning and clinical response using the latest and most applicable evidence-based practice research. Baseli ne: This process woul d build on the existin g training effo rts of the Iowa Con - sortiu m for M ental He alth. Rationale There is a nee d to identify resear ch in me n- tal health ser vices. Evidence-based pra ctice re- search must assess clinical outcom es, cost effec- tiveness, and functional improvem ent of con- sumers and families within the context of their daily activities. Rese arch f indings such as the Technical As sistance Colla borative Inc. (TAC) report to the State of Iowa increase s awareness of the needs in the field and the abilit y of the service sy stem to respond to such needs in an effective and cost-efficient manner. The TAC report contains excellent insights into, and analy sis of, approaches for Iow a's ma- jor m ental health challenges. Initiatives that maintain a sy stems perspective m ust utilize a data sy stem capable of supporting adm inistrative efficiencies and tracking outcomes through data analy sis. Data ele ments must be consistent and uniform acros s various service and pay ment sy s- tems to allow coherent, analy sis-based policy improvem ents am ong all public and pri vate mental health system s. 1218.1 Action Step By 2006, ide ntify research that will increase children' s mental health services by focusing on improvem ents to the overall service delivery system , such as defining evidence-base d and consensus-ba sed best pract ices for children. (An Iowa Consortium for Mental Health and Mental Health, Mental Retardatio n, Developmental Dis- abilities, and Brain Injur y Commission action step.) 1218.2 Action Step By 2006, ide ntify research that will im prove adult consumer mental hea lth services by focus- ing on the overall servic e delivery s ystem , such as defining evidence-base d and consensus-based best practices for adults. ( An Iowa Consortium for Mental Health and Mental Health, Mental Retardation, Develop mental Disabilities, and Brain Injury Commission action step.) 1218.3 Action Step By 2005, support and expand a process by which Communit y Mental Health Block Grant funds are increasingly used to support evidence- based practices. This will entail ongoi ng sup- port for an infrastructure to provide direct tech- nical assist ance on evidence-based practi ces to community mental health centers and other community providers, as well as monitoring and oversight capacity . (An I owa Consortium for Mental Healt h action step.) National Goal #6. Tec hnology is used to access mental health care and informa- tion. 1219 Goal Statement Develop a sy stem for c ollecting a uni- form set of mental health data across all publicl y funded services for adults and children (e.g., counties, rehabilitative treatment services, community mental health centers, Medica id). Baseline: This process would build on the system de sign efforts of the Mental Health, Ment al Retardatio n, De- velopmental Disabilities, and Brain Injury Com- missi on. Rationale Most private health insurance policies pro- vide little or no coverage for mental health ser- vices. This forces many adults with m ental ill- nesses and children with a psychiatric di agnosis with private insurance to seek public funding or go witho ut treatment. Iowa's publ ic system for mental health services is n ot uniform ly available or delivered, so data cannot be uniform ly col- lected. There are many way s to access p ublic mental health services, incl uding Medicaid pro- gram s, the 99 indivi dual co unty plans, Hawk-I program s, school programs, early child hood program s, child welfare an d juvenile j ustice pro- grams, and transition-to-adult services programs. Chap ter 1 2 Page 22 of 2 6 April 2005 Mental Health & Mental Disorders HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision All of these programs have different wa ys to collect mental health data. Private insurance co mpanies have highly developed dat a collection sy stem s to justify rate changes, modify coverage options, an d provide better service for their customers. To im prove Iowa' s public mental healt h service sy stem, the Iowa Depart ment of Hu man Services must, as the lead agency in this area, provide leadership both withi n its many depar tments and to other state agenci es including the Iowa Depart ment of Public Health, the Iowa Departm ent of Educa- tion, Adm inistration, and s o forth by first col- lecting unifor m data across the many publicly funded pr ograms for adults and children. This would lead to the establishment of state wide standard men tal health ser vices for all Iowans, while also all owing development of enhanced services funded by local jurisdictions. 1219.1 Action Step By 2006, post a request for proposals to award a contr act for the purpose of collecting usable data on children wit h serious em otional disorders and reco mmend uniform data sets needed to improve services fro m the following sources: Early Chil dhood (ages 0-5 ) program s, (Em - powerm ent, Early ACCESS); Early Perio dic Screening, Diagnosis & Treat ment (EPSDT); Medicaid's b ehavioral health contractor 's data for unde r aged 18 enr ollees; Community Mental Health Centers data on children; Area Educati on Agencies behavioral health data; Rehabilitative Treat ment Services behav- ioral health data; Psychiatric Medical Institutes for Children data; Mental Healt h Institutes data; and Juvenile Justice mental health data.

The federal gov- ernment identified 20 goals and action steps to address the nutrition issue s in this country. This chapter will focus on eight areas of concern. Healthful eati ng m ust start with children and be maintained thro ughout adulthoo d. The fam - ily and o ther channels, such as schools, work- sites and institutional food services, play a key role in this pr ocess. Food-related businesses can also be im portant vehicles for nutriti on inform a- tion for f oods bought in superm arkets, fast food outlets, restaurants, and carry -out operations. Public, pri vate and volu ntary organizatio ns must work together to educate the cons umer, present accur ate and consistent messages, and use social marketing to particular groups to m o- tivate Iowans to change be haviors and a dopt healthy eating plans. Iowans receiv e nutrition information and education from a variety of sources. However, they contin ue to be confuse d about nutrit ion messages. N utrition educators believe that using recognized and creditable nutrition t ools (food guide pyram id and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans) should be the f oundation of nutrition messages. E ducational materials and/or tools must also include the cultur al food of various ethnic grou ps. To encourage health professionals to dis cuss nutrition with patients, PACE (Provider-based Assessment training and C ounseling f or Exer- cise and Nutrition) trainin g was provided to 4 0 people in Jun e of 200 1, inc luding three p hysi- cians fro m Polk Count y. Social scienti sts have theories for behavior changes that are useful to nutrition educ ators. Understanding the causes f or dietary behaviors helps nutrition educators plan social marketing campaigns that target the underl ying factors to behavior choices. This approach means discov- ering the targ et audiences' perceptions about motivation, benefits, barriers, and infor mation sources. Iowa' s social marketing ca mpaign, Pick a Better Snack (PABS), was established in 2000 to increase co nsum ption of fruits and vegetables. Surve ys indic ate that low-income audiences most often recall message s on billboards , from school, on television, in grocery stores, and in WIC offices. Surve y participants say they were starting to eat m ore fruits and vegetables (25% ) and were thinking ab out eating m ore fruits and vegetables (36%) because of PABS. Breastf eeding has well-documented benefits for infants and m others, as well as e mployers. Benefits include lower abse nteeis m because in- fants are sick less often and breastfeedin g moth- ers have high er morale. According to a 1997 survey , 61.7% of Iowa mothers breastf ed their babies at the hospital, with 23% still breastfeed- ing at five to six m onths. Low breastfe eding duration rates are due in pa rt to lack of s upport at work. Women are often unable to overco me the various barriers to brea stfeeding or breast pumping at work and ch oose either not to start breastfe eding or discontinue it once the y return to work. To encourage worksite lact ation support, local Healthy Polk 2010 developed a bre astfeed- ing worksite support kit th at is distribut ed by the Iowa Department of Publi c Health. Training was conducted with child c are providers and a 1- day conference was held in Polk C ounty. In general, excess es and i mbalances of s ome food com ponents in the die t toda y have r eplaced once prevalent nutrient deficiencies. In particu- April 2005 Chap ter 1 3 Page 1 of 16 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Nutrition & Overweight lar, the prevalence of overweight has increas ed at an alar ming rate. More than one-third of American ad ults are now considered ove rweight based on body m ass index (BMI) measurements. In Iowa, the incidence of obesity increas ed every year since 19 89 for ad ults over age 18 ( BMI of 25.3% to 32.7%). In 2003, a team-based w eight m anage ment program titled Lighten Up Iowa (LUI) reported 1,400 team s with 11,7 00 participants in all 99 counties. Th e program resulted in a dra matic improvem ent in ph ysical activit y and consump- tion of fr uits and vegetables and a total loss of 47,000 pounds. In 1997, the average BMI f or the popula - tions of only five states w as greater than the per- centage in Iowa. This indicates that Iow ans are at increas ed health risk of chronic disease co m- pared to residents of a majorit y of other states. Current nutrit ion education and initiative s have failed to pro mote healthy body weights. The first five y ears of the decade saw a dra matic rise in adult and child overweight and obesity in the nation and in Iowa. The best way to address this critical issue, the work group determ ined, was to raise the visibilit y of the issue by includi ng \"overweight\" in the chapte r title. Childhood obesity is increasing at an alarm- ing rate nationally. Sur veys by the National Center for Health Statistics in the earl y 1990s found that 22 % of children aged 12 t o 17 were overweight at the 85th percentile co mpared to 15% from similar survey s conducted in the 1960s. The P ediatric Nutrition Sur veillance System reports that 9.5% of children aged 0 to 5 participating i n Iowa' s Supplem ental Food Pro- gram for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) were overweight at the 95t h percentile in 1998, an increase fr om 7.6% in 1985. Data for older Iowa children and adolescents are not currently available. A youth com ponent of Lig hten Up Iowa, Go the Distance, was added in 2004 with 2, 866 par- ticipants. Another progra m, the Iowa' s Partners for Healthy Kids Coalition, was est ablished to address healt h and weight-manage ment prob- lems for children. Statistics indicate that A mericans chroni- cally lack fruits and vegetables in their diets. In 1996 , Iowa ranked 50 th in the U.S. in per centage of adults reportedly eating at least five s ervings of fruits and vegetables per day. Fruits and vegetables are good f or the hum an bod y, out- standing sources of es sential vita mins and m in- erals, and vital for go od hea lth. Fruits and ve getables provide other diet ary compounds with powerful chronic disease risk- reduction pot ential. Eating m ore fruits and vegetables he lp prevent cancer. Based on grow- ing evidence, the incidence of other chronic dis- eases, such as coronary heart disease, art erio- sclerosis and stroke, can be reduced thro ugh i n- creased fruit and vegetable consum ption. Fruits and vegetables may also play a preventive role in birth defects, catara ct formation, hy perten- sion, asthma, diverticulosis, obesit y, and diabe- tes. Iowa is one of eight states to participate in the U.S. Depart ment of Agriculture (USDA) fruit and vege table snack program . Pick a Better Snack (PABS) trained nutrition ed ucators rep- resenting team nutrition schools, fruit and vege- table pilot schools, Chil d and Adult Care Food Programs, and Food Stamp Nutrition E ducation coalitions. T he Iowa Depart ment of Education, Iowa Department of Publi c Health, and Iowa State Univers ity Extension received the USDA' s Leadership, Innovation and Nutrition Collabora- tion (LINC) award for collaboration wit h the PABS Cam paign. Calciu m is essential for formation and main- tenance of healthy bo nes and teeth. Dairy prod- ucts, includin g milk, y ogurt and hard an d soft cheese s, are i mportant sources of calciu m in Io- wans' diets. U.S. esti mates indicate that as many as nine out of 10 wo men and six o ut of 1 0 men are not getting enou gh calciu m. Studies have found that people who m eet their needs for calciu m are more likely to m eet their needs for other ke y nutrients im portant for g ood health. Osteoporosis, one of t he most prevalent dis- eases in A merica, fracture s lives as well as bones. Costs associat ed wi th the disease in Iowa in 1995 were $76 m illion, and the proje cted cost is $229 m illion for 2015. Currently, the re is no fundin g for a n osteoporosi s program . However, the Iowa Osteoporosis coali tion has established non-pr ofit status and will maintain this status for potential fun ding opport unities. Chap ter 1 3 Page 2 of 16 April 2005 Nutrition & Overweight HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Nutritional or dietary facto rs contribute sub- stantially to preventable illnesses and prem ature death in the United States. Im provements in diet are critical to ensure a reduction of m ajor chronic disease risks. The benefits fro m desir- able dietary habits can be enorm ous. Heart dise ase, cancer, stro ke, and diabetes the four leading causes of death in the United States along with obesit y, hypertension and osteoporosis, are all linked to diet. T ogether, these seven conditi ons account f or an estimated $250 billion e ach y ear in medical costs and lost productivi ty a significan t portio n of w hich might be saved b y improved nutriti on. Eating disorders can be a c oncern to m any families. While food is the assu med focus of the disorder, food is, in fact, onl y the s ymptom. Nutrition professionals may assist with s uch concerns, but it must be understood that mental health professionals will take the lead in treat- ment. Food securit y is defined as \"access by all people at all tim es to enough foo d for a n active, healthy life, and includes at m inimum: a) the ready availabilit y of nutriti onall y adequa te and safe foods, and b) the assured abilit y to acquire acceptable fo ods in socially acceptable ways (e.g. without resorting to e mergency food sup- plies, scaven ging, stealing, and other coping strategies\" (L ive Sciences Rese arch Offi ce, 1990). Food i nsecurity occurs when a lim ited or uncertain availabilit y of nutritionall y adequate and safe foods are available or lim ited, or there is an uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socia lly acceptable way s. Data from 1995 on f ood insecurity from the U.S. Depart- ment of Agriculture show that 11.9 million households e xperience food insecurit y at some level. In 19 97, appro ximately 242,000 Iowans indicated some degree of food insecurit y, ac- cording t o the Food Research and Action Center. This means t hat many have had to use emer- gency food sources, scave nge or steal to get food. I n 1998, U.S. cities reported a 14% in- creas e in the de mand for emergency food. This may be due in part to welfare refor m that has cut the availability of food stam ps for many people. Food securit y is achieved when people have access at all ti mes to enough food for an active, healthy lifesty le. Iowa has a few local grass- roots agricult ure-based, anti-hunger groups, but lacks a statewide network strong en ough to get more state fu nding for food assistanc e. The Iowa Alliance to End Hunger was formed in Oc- tober 2003 to address food insecurity . In 200 3, appr oxim ately 561,069 people aged 60 and older lived in the state. Iowa ranks sec- ond i n the nat ion for havin g the largest percent- age of people aged 85 and older (2.6% ). This segment is gr owing faster than the rest of the populati on. The state ran ks sixth in t he nation for people ag ed 75 and older (7.87% ), and fifth for people ag ed 65 and older (14.7% ). Projections for Iowa indicate that the num- ber of elderly will continue to increase while the number of y outh will decli ne. During t he 1990s, the num ber of babies born in Iowa fell below the death rate. The percentage of people 60 years and older is expected to gr ow to 63 5,890 by 2010, according to t he Iow a Depart ment of Elder Affairs. In 19 92 through 1994, nut rition screening was conducted i n the Hom e Care Aide Program with participants aged 60 and older. The screenin g tool was de veloped by the A meri- can Academ y of Fam ily Physicians, the National Council on the Aging, and the Am erican Die- tetic Associ ation. T his tool is now incor porated into the regist ration for all Older American Act funded services, including home deliver ed and congregate meals. The Senior Farm er's Market Nutrition Pro gram continu es to grow, serving 20,997 ol der adults in 2 004. A co-fund ed nutri- tion position i s maintained by the Iowa Depart- ment of Publi c Health and the Iowa Departm ent of Elder Affairs. Goal Statements & Action Steps 131 Goal Statement Provide educational tools for Iow ans to make decisions on the reliability of nutri- tion messages through at least three media. Baseline: See Rationale. April 2005 Chap ter 1 3 Page 3 of 16 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Nutrition & Overweight Rationale Consumers seek nutrition inform ation and education from a variety of sources, y et remain confused about the m essage. According to the 1997 American Dietetic Association Media Sur- vey, consum ers used ily or friends, and b ooks. Although television is the major source of nutrition inform ation, it is judged as \"ve ry valu- able\" b y only 24% of peop le. Am erican s rank as valued sources of nutrition inform ation: dieti- tians and/or n utritionists ). However, a 1995 article in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine re- ported that only 21% of phy sicians agreed that they find co unseling patien ts about dietary is- sues professi onally gratifying. A big increase in the awareness of the Food Guide P yramid (67% ) has o ccurred since 1993 (58%) when it was introduced. Of A mericans who are aware of the p yramid, 43% rate it high in helping select a balance d diet. The next step is to get Iowans to use it to adopt health y eating. Public, pri vate and volu ntary organizatio ns must work together to educate the cons umer, provide accurate and consistent messages, and use social marketing to m otivate dietary behav- ior change. 131.1 Action Step By 2005 and ongoi ng thereafter, aim for 50% of those survey ed by the Iowa Depa rtment of Public Health to recogni ze the updated Foo d Guide P yramid and use it t o make at least one food cho ice decision daily .

Rationale According to a 1997 sur vey of Iowa m others by Ross Prod ucts, a divisio n of Abb ott Labora- tories, the Healthy Iowans 2000 goal tha t 61.7% of infants be breastfed at birth was close to being Chap ter 1 3 Page 4 of 16 April 2005 Nutrition & Overweight HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision met. However, duration rates have fallen , with only 23% of infants still being breastfed at six months. Low breastfe eding duration is due in part to the lack of support at work . Wom en are often unable to overco me barrier s to breastfee ding or breast pum ping at work and choose to not start breastfe eding or discontinue it once the y return to work. Several sources h ave indicated the fol- lowing barriers: Rigid break times and/or insufficient ti me to express breas t milk; Employers not allowing a woman to express breast milk at work; Not having a place to express brea st milk; Length of m aternity leave; and Lack of infor mation about breastfeeding and working.

Weight reduction pr ograms have been studied intens ively and, wit hout exceptio n, have not pr oduced lasting healthy weights. T here- fore, preventi on of overweight is of primary im- portance. The principal health risk is weight gain regardless of the body m ass index (BMI). Small losses of approxim ately 5% of bo dy weight have been shown to decrease morbidity from hypertension and prevent the conv ersion of impaired glucose tolerance to overt T ype 2 dia- betes in so me people. Small weight losses would result in mainte- nance of the prevalence ra te.

Baseli ne: 8.5% of 2-5 year 1999 Pedi atric Nutrition Surveillance System. Rationale Childho od obesity is a complex disorder involv ing genetic and environm ental factors. The consequences of childhood obesit y range from great health risks, such as hy pertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes, to phy sical im- pairm ent. Psy chological c oncerns include pre- occupation with body image, disordered eating, lack of self-c onfidence, lowered self- concept, depression, and peer rejection. Unfortunately , treatment has shown few positive, long-t erm results. Also, dieting i n children is high ly dis- couraged due to the n utritional needs of growing children. Given the extent and seriousness of the disorder and the difficulty in attaining good treatment outco mes, an e mphasis on pre vention is needed. Prevention of overweight in child- hood shoul d be given the highest priori ty. 134.1 Action Step By 2010, promote policy change in p ublic and private schools to su pport health y lifestyles with such strategies as fruit and vegetable pro- gram s to prov ide health y snacks and school wellness policies that include goals for nutrition education and phy sical activity .

Baseli ne, 19 96 Behavio ral Risk Facto r Survei llance Survey : 15.1%. Rationale Growing evid ence links fruit and vegetable consum ption with disease prevention and con- trol. Year 2000 Dietary Guidelines: The Cas e for Fruits and Vegetables F irst includes: April 2005 Chap ter 1 3 Page 7 of 16 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Nutrition & Overweight More than 500,000 Americ ans die from can- cer each y ear. Eating five or more servings of fruits and veg etables a day can help prev ent one- third of these deaths. The fiber in f ruits and veg etables may help in the m anagement of diabetes. Obesity and overweight no w affect 10 mil- lion U.S. chil dren and has doubled in the last 20 years. Alm ost a quarter of all vegetables con- sumed by U.S. children are French fries , with only one in fi ve children eating the five or more recommended servings of fruits and veg etables per day. High-fiber di ets are known to pro vide th e best defense against the developm ent of diver- ticulosis. Data suggest that a high i ntake of fruits and vegetables en hances ventila tory function, reduc- ing the risk of chronic obstr uctive pulm onary disease. Scientists esti mate that half of all neural tube defects could be prevented if wom en con- sumed the recommended intake of folic acid shortl y before they conceiv e. Fruits and vegeta- bles containin g folic acid along with f ortified grain prod ucts can play a vital role in m eeting folic acid rec ommendations to prevent these de- fects. Epidem iological evidence suggests a strong protective rol e for fruits and vegetables in coro- nary heart disease. Although the evidence is still lim ited, the risk reduction for hig h fruit and vegetabl e intake on stroke m ay be up to 25%. The 5 A Day For Better Health program is a nationwide nutrition cam paign to encourage Americans to eat five or more servings of fruits and vegetables every day for better health. A state coalition has been formed and includes rep- resentatives f rom major grocery store chains, produce bro kers, the Iowa Grocery Industry As- sociation, the Iowa Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association, the A merican Cancer Societ y, the Food Bank of Iowa, the Io wa State University Extension, t he Iowa Nutrition Education Net- work, the Iow a Depart ment of Agricultur e and Land Stewardship, and t he Iowa Department of Public Health. The purpose of the coalition is to pr omote and increase consum ption of fruits and vegeta-bles b y Iowans throu gh pa rtnerships with or- ganizations that can 1) increase public aware- ness of the importance of eating at least five servings of fruits and veget ables every day; and 2) provi de co nsumers with specific information about h ow to include m ore such servings into daily eating. Coalitions such as the Iowa 5 A Day Coali- tion and the Iowa Nutrition Education N etwork need to join with the nationwide nutriti on cam- paign to com municate the importance of eating fruits and vegetables to lower the risk of heart disease, c ancer, diabetes a nd high blood pres- sure.

Basel ine: 1999 Be havioral Risk Facto r Surveillan ce System and the Youth Ri sk Behav- ior Surv ey. Rationale In the fall of 1997 , the National Academy of Sciences incr eased the re commended le vel of calciu m intak e. Children and teens aged 9 to 18 need 1,30 0-mg of calcium daily, which i s equal to four servin gs of a m ilk food group . Failure to maxi mize intake will increase the risk teens face for stress fractures now and osteoporosi s and other diseases later. It is es timated that nearly 40% of post- menopausal wo men will suffer an osteoporosis fracture during their remaining life- time. According to the year 2000 U.S. Census Bu- reau, the median age of Iowa' s women is 39.1 years. Iowa is ranked number two natio nally in the percentage of pop ulatio n over aged 8 5, num - ber six in the percentage of pop ulation over aged 75, and number five in the percentage of pop ula- tion o ver aged 65. Pop ulation pr ojection s show the num ber of wo men aged 65 and over will in- creas e by 36% over the next 20 years. The Iowa Osteoporosis Coalition, com prised of about 100 people, began as a task force in July 1998. T he coalition i s committed to raising awar eness an d providing education on the pre- vention, screening an d treatment of osteoporosis. Its goal is to establish, coordinate and pr omote osteoporosis prevention an d treatm ent education, raise public awarene ss, an d educate consu mers, health professionals, teache rs, other stake- holders, and public p olicy makers. It is, there- fore, appropriate for the coalition to assume re- sponsibilit y for the com pletion of objectives whose ai m is to increase ca lcium in diets .

Educa tion will target groups that are at risk or potential risk for osteoporosis (a baseline su rvey was conducted in 1999) by providi ng information and resources on osteopo- rosis prevention, detection, treatm ent, an d sup- port for health professionals and consumers on the Iowa Dep artment of Public Health's web site Identif ation m aterials for consumers that accuratel y translate the latest s cientific in- formation on osteoporosis i nto easy -to- understand term s that are culturall latest sci entific and m edical inform ation int o clinical applications; Identify available curricula for training health and hu man service providers and com- munity leaders on osteopor osis preventio n, de- tection and eatment; Investigate providing a downloadable, inter- active co mputer program for adolescents to use in science an d health pro grams through out the state; Sponsor a spe aker on osteo porosis at a statewide conference; Provide a lin k to inf ormation o n bone- density screening sites on the Iowa Dep artment of Public Health web site; and Inform health professionals, phy sicians and consumers of the im portan ce of bone de nsity screening and the location of screening sites and reimbursement procedures. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health and Iowa Osteoporosis Task Force action step.) 137 Goal Statement Provide Iow ans at hig her risk for nutri- tion-related disease because of famil y history , genetics, disabilities, and /or life- style choic es targeted information on reducing such diseases and death risks. Baselin e: See Ration ale. Rationale Three leading health indicators related to nutrition are key factors in the prevention of chronic diseases: healthy eating, phy sical activ- ity, and obesity. Coronary heart diseas e is the leading cause of death in the United States, ac- counting for nearly 500,000 deaths annu ally. Experts recommend that phy sicians e mphasize ways to preve nt coronary heart disea se, such as counseling their patients to exercise more and eat a healthy diet. Also, a num ber of studies show that regular phy sical activity can signifi- cantly reduce the risk of de veloping Type 2 dia- betes, which also appears t o be associate d with obesity. Dietary modifications, together with main- tenance of ph ysical activit y and appro priate body m ass, can reduce can cer incidence and death betwee n 30% and 40% over ti me. Based on current Iowa rate s, dietary changes could, in time, prevent between 4,000 and 5,500 cases of cancer every year. Evidence of dietary protection against can- cer is strongest and m ost consistent for diets high i n veget ables and fruits, and, therefore, in fiber, antioxi dants and oth er bioactive ph yto- chemicals. Chap ter 1 3 Page 10 of 1 6 April 2005 Nutrition & Overweight HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Phytochem icals are the va st array of che mi- cal substances found naturally in fruits, vegeta- bles and grains. These substances, wit h nam es such as beta- carotene, ly copene and isoflavones, show trem endous potential to fight disease on several fronts . An im porta nt finding in recent years is that diets high in vegetables and fruits are as sociated with a reduced risk of cancers of the prostate, m outh, pharynx, esophag us, stom- ach, cervix, colon, and rectum . The training and expertise of nutriti on pro- fessionals in treat ment and keeping people healthy are crucial to achieving t he goal s of Healthy Iowans 201 0. Tha t's especially true when diagnos is for a chroni c disease has been made. Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) refers to the com prehensive services provided by a registered dietitian or ot her nutrition pr ofes- sional as part of a patient's health-care te am. Medical nutrition therap y in a variety of health-care s ettings reflects the com plexities of changing diet and behavior , especially for pa- tients with serious chronic illnesses. The ther- apy has been proven effective in treating and controlling cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabe- tes, high chol esterol, cancer, and ot her life- threatening conditions. Studies also show that patients recei ving m edical nutrition therapy re- quire less hospitalizations and m edicatio ns and experience fe wer co mplications. 137.1 Action Step By 2010, provide Iowans inform ation on how to access a licensed dietitian for nutrition counseling. ( An Iowa Dep artment of Public Health and Iowa Diet etics Association a ction step.) 137.2 Action Step By 2010, ens ure that licensed dietitians are mem bers of all known chr onic disease task forces and/or coalitions and advisory councils on chronic disease, and that they are also repre- sented on ins urance-benefi t task forces.

Baseli ne, 199 Rationale Food i nsecurity that fam ilies have had to use str ategies such as emergency food sources, sc avenging, or stealing to m eet their basic food ne eds. It' s opposite - food security - is achieved w hen people ha ve acce ss at a ll times to enough food for an active, healthy lifesty le. Food i nsecurity is affected by many uncon- trollable social and economic variables . States that have org anized anti-hunger networ ks or coalitions have affect ed stat e polic y, and many have allocated state funds t o fill m onetary gaps from decreasing or stagnan t federal fund ing.

With an anti- hunger netwo rk, state policy could be affected and additi onal fundin g obtained. Besides a ffecting state it can increase awar eness of governm ental program s and other assist ance av ailable to individuals and fam ilies in need of food resources. Food stam ps are often very lim ited for many families, and so me subgroups are at an even greater risk of need. The welfar e refor m act re- quired recipients to go to w ork. As a result, the y were no long er eligible for food stam ps. How- ever, low wages have resu lted in a short age of money for fo od. T he follo wing subgro ups ex- alone: 7.4% Children are at particular risk due to lac k of proper food because inadeq uate nutrition leads to po or cogni tive develop ment and lower levels of school readiness. In 1995, one in seven children in Iowa lived in poverty , according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The Fa mily Invest ment Program (FIP) average monthly caseload for 2003 was 19,843. The number of recipients has dropped b y more than 50% since we lfare refor m began. Resear ch shows that families le aving the welfare system are at an even higher risk of food i nsecurity. Families going from welfare to work m ake an average of $6 per h our, but the y need $11 per hour t o pay for basic needs. 138.1 Action Step Through 2010, buil d on the Iowa Allian ce to End Hunger t hat was formed in October 200 3. Throug h 2004, organizatio nal meetings were held that worked on recruitment, membership, structure, and so forth. I n 2005 , a m ission statement wil l be develope d and activit y will begin on a work plan t hat will be developed an- nuall y thereafter. The Iowa Legal Aid and the Food Bank of Iowa worked to create an Iowa Food Pantr y Directory that will be posted on Legal Aid's web site. The Food Bank will dis- tribute bo oklets to organizations needing to know about emergency food distributi on. Dur- ing 2005, Iowa Food Ba nks will conduct Hunger Study 2005, a nationwide study that will also produce an Iowa report. The study will inter- view food pr oviders and c lients and be ready for distributio n in the fall of 2 005.

Unfortunately, som e changes make assuring worker safety and health more challenging. For example, the num ber of w orkers who speak English as a second langua ge has greatly in- creas ed. Safe ty materials and training are nor- mally in E nglish, making it difficult for e mploy- ers to conve y critical information about work place dangers and m ethods of protection such as materi al saf ety data sheets that e mployers must make availabl e to e mployees to warn of hazards of certain chemical s. A dra matic increas e in outsourcing and short-ter m employment has also occurr ed. Many temporary , subcontr acted and contingent workers have not been ade quately trained for the jobs the y are perform ing. Determining who is responsible for protecting and training t hese workers can be difficult. I n many indus tries, it is the inexperienced worker who runs the great- est risk of injury . Disorders resulting fr om repetitive m ove- ments are becom ing more common and are likely to become more pro minent as the percent- age of older workers incre ases. The U. S. De- partm ent of Labor has not a dopted a specific standard for protecting workers fro m these dis- orders. Iowa cannot adopt a standard of its own without state legislative action. F or the s ame reason, the Iowa Division of Labor Services cannot act on workplace violence, which dispro- portionatel y affects wo men. A total of 23, 032 occupational injuries and illnesses that required recuperation away from work be yond the da y of the incident were re- ported in private industr y in Iowa durin g 1997. The num ber was 30,800 f or 199 0, indicating a 23% decrease. Fatalities, however, did not change significantly . In 1997, there were 92 work-related fatalities in Iowa, including 57 who were e mployees and 35 who were not em ploy- ees. In 1990, there were 9 3 fatalities, including 60 who were e mployees and 33 who were not. In 2004, Iowa 's labor force averaged 1,623,800. O f that labor fo rce, 78,400 people were unem ployed for a 4 .8% unem ployment rate. Historical labor force and unem ployment statistics were revised in March 2005. Thus, in 1997 , Iowa's labor force averaged 1,606, 600, of which 50,7 00 were unem ployed for a 3 .2% un- employment rate. In 199 0, the labor forc e aver- aged 1,45 8,900; of for a 4.5% unem ployment rate. Farming continues to be the most hazard ous occupation in Iowa. The death rate in agricul- ture is nearly 10 tim es the a verage for all work- ers. Yet, Congress has prohibited the expendi- ture of federal matching funds for occup ational safety and he alth education, consultatio n and enforcem ent in farm ing op erations with 10 or fewer employees. Additionally , agricultural fa- cilities em ploy many recent immigrants, raising concerns about such condi tions as tuberculosis. Although the challenges of assuring worker safety and he alth are great, resources to help employers have increased. For exam ple, Iowa provides free consultation, advice and education on creating safer workplace s to e mployers throug h the C onsultation a nd Ed ucation Bureau in the Iowa Division of Labor Services. The amount of training and out reach by the bureau increased thr ough the past decade, along with the size of its staff. Nonetheless, many Iowa businesses ar e not yet aware of those services. The em otional, ph ysical an d financial tol l of workplace fat alities, injuries and illnesses is sub- stantial. Ass uring the safe ty and health of work- April 2005 Chap ter 1 4 - Page 1 of 10 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Occupational Safety & Health ers provides benefits acros s the board. Workers benefit directly from fewer fatalities, injuries and illnesses. Fam ilies of workers benefit from more stable i ncomes, avoidance of medical and rehabilitation costs, and less em otional trau ma. Businesse s benefit fro m improved e mployee morale and re duced worker com pensation and other costs. Society benefits when more people are healthy enoug h to co ntinue workin g to sup- port them selves and their fa milies r ather than beco ming beneficiaries of public services. Many Iowa workers are ex posed to danger- ous situations every workday . With pr oper knowledge, e quipm ent, caution, an d pre cautions, these sources of harm can be re moved or lim- ited, and injuries, illnesses and deaths prevented. Progress The m id-cour se review pro cess identifie d a number of advances in occupational safety and health. Overall occupational injury and illness rates fell 20.4% , 5.4% more than the ori ginal goal for 2 010. The Iowa Division of Labor Ser- vices reporte d that it has focused on voluntary protection programs such as the Safety and Health Achievem ent Reco gnition progr am, which was st affed, i mplemented, promoted, and expanded. Sa fer Workplaces 2000 has been de-leted from Healthy Iowans 2010 , but remains part of the Io wa Occupational Safety and Health strategic plan. When Healthy Iowans 201 0 was originally developed, o ne goal focus ed on occupat ional injuries and illnesses in agr iculture. This goal was revis ed to focus on injuries only , specifi- cally due to c hanges in the agricultural injur y registry . The change resulted in an assumed underreportin g due to changes in how da ta was collected and reported. Cur rent data cannot be used to com pare data colle cted in 2000 and ear- lier because o f the different reporting s ystems used; thus, ne w baseline da ta has been se t. Many action steps in the agricultural focus have progressed and som e are highlighte d here. Progress includes the completion of a Certified Safe Far m pilot research pr oject in northwest Iowa that included appro ximately 150 fa rmers who received program serv ices. The progra m ran from early 19 98 thr ough Jul y 31, 2004. En- rolled farm ers reported a reduction in c ertain respiratory conditions, an increased awareness of far m healt h and safety hazards, and a n in- creas e in the use of respira tory personal protec- tive equipm ent. Satisfaction with the e ducation and services was high. Chap ter 1 4 - Page 2 of 10 April 2005 Occupational Safety & Health HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision The Certified Safe Farm (CSF) program has since begun enrollm ent for a greatly expanded program in Iowa by targeti ng 600 farm ers, four times the size of the initial program . It also in- volves m ore financial a nd in-kind partnerships with the Iowa Farm Bureau International. The CSF gained greater visibilit y through these partners hips. With the help of Well mark, Inc., CSF is now able to analy ze health insur- ance clai ms d ata fro m farmers in the progra m and com pare the m to clai ms fro m farmers not enrolled in th e program (control farm ers) to de- termine if CS F reduces far m-relat ed illnesses and injuries as reflect ed in health insurance claims. The goal is to be a ble to provide CSF to farm ers throughout the U.S . throu gh su pport from health, property /casualty, and liability in- surance co mpanies and agribusinesses that see benefit in providing incenti ves to farm ers who voluntaril y enroll. In another agricultural initiative, increasi ng health and safety education for farm youth was a priorit y. In 2003, t he Farm Safety 4 Just Kids chapter netw ork and m embership in Iowa wa s reported to ha ve grown b y nine chapters, thou gh total me mbership showed a slight decline. In yet another initiat ive, enhancement of web sites to increase access to knowledge of agricult ural health and safety is com plete. Organizat ions now have links to each ot her; and the Iowa Cen- ter for Agricultural Safety and Health (I-CASH) is in the proc ess re-de signing its web site. A \"What's New?\" section will be added and all organizations will be encouraged to submit news releas es for posting. In its m ission and vision for the Iowa Occu- pational Safety and H ealth Act (IOSHA) 2004 throug h 2008, the Iowa Division of Lab or Ser- vices reporte d that the construction culture in April 2005 Chap ter 1 4 - Page 3 of 10 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Occupational Safety & Health Iowa has bee n very receptive to prom otional and collaborative efforts for job site safety and health. The I OSHA consu ltation pro gram at- tributes its succes s in promoting to the c onstruc- tion industr y to partnership and alliance within the construction trade, bu ilding a trusti ng rela- tionship with several co mpanies that have pro- moted their services to others, and an increas e in construction. The focus on the construction in dustr y re- sulted in m ajor increases i n inspections and suc- cess in obtaining requests from contractors for on-site technical as sistanc e. The Consultation and Educatio n Bureau proj ected 102 con struc- tion uring 2003, but actually perfo rmed more (209). A targeted focus has been on in- creasing the num ber of people receiving the 10- hour occupati onal safety and health gene ral in- dustr y trainin g course. In 2003 , more than a 28% increase occurred in the num ber of people taking the classes compared to the 2000 base- line. Contractors are showing m uch vol untar y compliance and willingness to adopt saf er work habits. The Iowa Division of Labor Services reported that all IOSHA in spection staff has had some construction training and all have had peer training. The overall g oal for the co nstruction in dus- try has been expanded from an initial foc us on falls to a broader focus on general fatalities. The main reason is the broad i mpact of each action step. Since the im plementation of the a ction steps, Iowa has had a 21% decrea se in c onstruc- tion fatalities. The new goal establishes a tar- geted 25% total reduction i n employee work- related deaths in the Iowa construction i ndustr y. The last goal for this chapter focuses on blood-lead le vels. The Io wa Department of Pu b- lic Health rep orts that it continues to send in- formation to adults with bl ood-lead levels greater than or equal to 25 microgra ms per deci- liter (\u00b5g/dl). As of 2003, a 21% decrease in the number of Iowans aged 16 years and old er with such bloo d-lead concentrations was reported. The program receives $25,000 per year from the National Institute for O ccupational Safety and Health (NIOS H). The Department originall y planned to begin providi ng information in 2 002 abo ut the health effects of lead exposure an d methods to reduce exposure to a dults reportin g blo od-lead l evels greater than or to 10 \u00b5g/dl. However, given the sig nificant num ber of adults who con- tinue to have blood-lead co ncentrations greater than or equal to 25 \u00b5g/dl, t he Depart ment will delay implementation unti l more significant im - provem ent has been made in this po pulat ion with higher b lood-lead con centrations. The De- partm ent applied for a NIOSH grant to c onduct more occupat ional health surveillance and inter- vention, but does not currentl y have fu nding to take additional action. Goal Statements & Action Steps 141 Goal Statement Reduce the overall occupational injury and illness rate in Iow a to 7 cases per 100 full-time workers. Baselin e: 1997, 9.3 cases; 2005, 7.4 ca ses (Iowa Workforce Devel- opment, Division of Labo r Service s, in coope ra- tion with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Stati stics). Rationale Reducing the frequency of workplace injury and illness benefits every one. Workers, fam i- lies, business es, and societ y benefit from a re- duction in the emotional and financial losses that result, especi ally from more serious, disabling conditions and deaths. The original goa l for 2010 was to reduce the overall occupational in- jury and il lness rates by at least 15% by 2010. In 2002, the occupational injury and illness rat e had fallen to 7.4 cases per 100 full-tim e workers, a 20.4% redu ction. In i ts 2003 ann ual report, the Iowa Workforce Develop ment reported that Iowa OSHA is redesigning procedures with the goal of lower ing the rate even further b y 2008. Additionall y, data fro m 2001 and 2002 iden- tified falls, crushing i njuries, being struc k by or against an obj ect, and expo sure to harm ful sub- stances as the top causes of death in Iow a. In 2001 , crushin g injuries were the most frequent with nine of t he total 29 fat alities. In 2002, be- ing struck by or against an object was the most frequent cause with 11 of t he total 30 fat alities. The action steps below help focus resources for worker safety and health o n the m ost hazardous Chap ter 1 4 - Page 4 of 10 April 2005 Occupational Safety & Health HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision workplaces a nd expand available resour ces by bringin g employers into pa rtnership with the Iowa Division of Labor Se rvices. 141.1 Action Step Throug h 2010, staff, im plement, prom ote, and expand voluntar y protection progra ms such as the Safety and Health Achievem ent Recogni- tion pr ogram . (An Iowa Division of Lab or Ser- vices action s tep.) 141.2 Action Step Throug h 2010, annuall y collect and analy ze data on the most common work-related fatalities by cause of death. Based upon this analy sis, identify and use additional resources on the m ost hazardous workplaces, the m ost dangerous in- dustries, and the m ost common caus es of injury and illness. (An Iowa Division of Labor Ser- vices action s tep.) 142 Goal Statement Decrease occupational fatal and nonfatal injuries in agricultural populations as follow s: Decrease by 25% overall fatal and nonfatal injuries in the farm population. Baselin e, 200 3: 840 fatal and nonfatal in juries, including 40 f atalities (Io wa Depa rtment of Pub- lic He alth and Iowa State University Extensio n). Decrease by 50% occu pational- related fatal injuries in farm youth. Base- line, 2003: 8 fatalities amo ng chil dren aged 18 and un der (Iowa Depa rtment of Public Health and Iowa State University Extension ). Certify 2,000 Io wa farms in the Certi- fied Safe Farm progra m to generall y re- duce hazardous exposures on farms. Baselin e, 200 4: 170 farms (Certified Safe Farm program). Rationale Agriculture re mains one of the m ost hazard- ous ind ustries in Iowa. Occupational de ath rates have not changed significantly over the past decade. Children, wom en and m inority workers are speci al-ris k populations . The m ajority of agricultural operations are not covered by the Iowa Occupational Safety and Health Act (IOSHA) be cause they have fewer than 10 em - ployees, so the action steps below focus on pro- gram s other than IOSHA. For exam ple, the Certified Safe Far m pro- gram provides extra economic incentives to farmers for making a variety of safety and health improvem ents. Farm Safety 4 Just Kids is an Iowa-based i nternational organization that en- courages gras sroots activity to prevent far m- related childhood i njuries, health risks, and fa- talities. The Sharing Health Awareness United Network (SHAUN) recognizes the increased risk to fam ilies of those who ha ve suffered farm - related accidents. It pro vides counselors and other m ental health service s for fa milies to re- duce the odds the fam ily will suffer a second stress-induced accident. Given current budget restraints, SH AUN decided to change its action step to maintaining its curr ent volunteer level instead of expanding it. 142.1 Action Step By 2010, increase he alth and safety educa- tion for farm youth by expanding t he Farm Safety 4 Just Kids chapter network to 30 chap- ters and 750 mem bership in Iowa. Baseline, 1999: 13 chapters and 470 mem bers. (A Farm Safety 4 Just Kids action step.) April 2005 Chap ter 1 4 - Page 5 of 10 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Occupational Safety & Health 142.2 Action Step Through 2010, m aintain the Sharing Health Awar eness United Network. Baseline, 1999: 20 volunteers were trained stat ewide. (An Iowa Department of Public Health action step. ) 142.3 Action Step Through 2010, increase ha nds-on training for far mers, a gricultural safety educators, and emergency medical personnel as follows: Annuall y train 2,0 00 firefi trauma and/or rescue; Annuall y train 2,5 00 Iowa teens aged 14 to 15 on tractor safety ; and Annuall y train 50 high school v ocational agriculture teachers in trac tor safety . (A National Education Center For Agri cul- tural Safety action step.) 142.4 Action Step Throug h 2010, enhance federally funded program s on agricultural health and safe ty, such as the Gre at Plains Center f or Agricultural Health and the fatality assessment and control evaluation pr ogram . (A University of I owa and Iowa Department of Publi c Health actio n step.) 142.5 Action Step Throug h 2010, contin ue pl anning an d coor- dination am ong the agenci es to provide public service announcem ents and other comm unity inform ation on farm health and safety that is also culturally sensitive and language appropri- ate. (An Iowa Department of Agricultur e and Land Stewardship, Iowa Center for Agricultural Safety and H ealth, Iowa Departm ent of Public Health, Iowa State Univers ity, and University of Iowa action step.) 142.6 Action Step Throug h 2010, contin ue to enhance relevant web sites to increase access to knowled ge of agricultural health and safe ty. (An Iowa De- partm ent of Public Health, Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stew ardship, Univ ersity of Iowa, Iowa State Universit y, and Iowa Center for Agricultur al Safety and Health action step.) 142.7 Action Step Throug h 2010, contin ue to endorse, pro mote and enact the educational, incentive-base d and regulatory aspects of \"Tractor Risk Abate ment and Control: The Polic y Conference\" (TRAC conference, S eptem ber 10-12, 1997, the Institute for Rural and Environm ental Health, Un iversity of Iowa) with the Iowa Departm ent of Public Health monitoring tractor i njuries. The Iowa Department of Transportation sho uld promote lightin g and marking standards for tractors on the roadway ; the Iowa Dep artment of Education and the Iowa Department of Transportation should assure that schools i nclude tractor safety and roadway safety (regarding tractors on roads) in driver' s education courses, and the Iowa De- partment of Transportation should assure that driver' s training and driver' s license test s in- clude questio ns on safe op eration of veh icles on roadway s where far m machinery operates; and the Iowa legislature should enact model legisla- tion listed elsewhere in this plan. Basel ine: Av- erage annual tractor-related fatalities totaled 22 from 1990 to 1997; it is esti mated that success- ful im plemen tation of these measures will re- duce annual I owa tractor-related fatalities to no more than an average of 7 b y 2010. (An I- CASH a ction step.) 143 Goal Statement Decrease by 25% empl oyee w ork-related deaths in the Io wa industry . Baselin e, 199 8: 14 work-re lated death s (Iowa Workforce De velopment, Di vision of Lab or Ser- vices, Bureau of Labor Statistics, in coo peration with the U.S. Burea u of La bor Statistics). Rationale The construction industr y is very hazardous and a significant source of workplace fat alities in Iowa. Cru shing and fall ing are two of the most common causes of construction fa talities and am ong the most preventable. Redu cing crushing and falling rates could have a signifi- cant i mpact o n construction workers, their fa mi- lies, their e mployers, and workplace injury and illness statisti cs overall. Chap ter 1 4 - Page 6 of 10 April 2005 Occupational Safety & Health HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision The original goal targeted falls in the con- struction ind ustry, but wide ning t he focu s to general fatalit ies se ems right at the m id-course review given the potential f or broad im pact of the action steps. The m id-course review also discovered that the Iowa Division of Labor Ser- vices reported in its 2003 annual report that of the 379 t otal inspections conducted, 4 5.4% (172) were construction inspectio ns. This was 20.4% higher than t he projected objective of 25 %, thus the related action step has been updated. Lastly , the Iowa Division of Labor Services rep orted that all Iowa Occupational Safety and H ealth Act inspection staff has had som e construction hazard training, m eeting the related Healthy Io- wans 201 0 action step. 143.1 Action Step Throug h 2010, maintain construction i n- spections at a m inimum of 25% of overall in- spection time. (An Iowa Division of Labor Ser- vices action s tep.) 143.2 Action Step Throug h 2010, annuall y com plete a mini- mum of 200 c onstruction visits focused on re- ducing i njury and death in the industr y. (An Iowa Division of Labor Se rvices action step.) 144 Goal Statement Expand and promote safety and health training opportunities for emplo yers, emplo yees and medical professionals. Baselin e: See Ration ale. Rationale Many injuries and illnesses in the workplace are preventable if proper work practices are fol- lowed and on ly pro per equ ipment is ther em ployees want inj uries and illnesses to occur; however, often the y simply do not k now ho w to prevent t hem. In some in- stances, medi cal personnel do not know how to perform certain procedures, which lim its proper reporting and correct treatment and prevention. Medical personnel and providers are often un- aware of Iowa's work-related reporting r equire-ments. This results in unde rreporting, w hich hinders and d elays prom pt prevention. 144.1 Action Step Throug h 2010, annuall y provide a m inimum of ten 10- hour occupational safety and h ealth general industry training c ourses. (An Iowa Di- vision of Labor Services a ction step.) 144.2 Action Step Throug h 2010, contin ue to educate medical personnel abo ut tests needed for certain afflic- tions, especia lly chem ical o n reportin g requirements of work- related conditions. (An Iowa Department of Public Health and Univers ity of Iowa/College of Public Health action step.) 145 Goal Statement Establish a baseline on the number of children engaged in unhealth y activities in the workplace. Base line: See Rationale. Rationale Although current law proh ibits children aged 17 and younger from engaging i n many unhealthy work activities, children still perform these tasks an d suffer inju ries and illnesses. The resources ava ilable for public education and en- force ment ar e minimal, and the law has not been updated to ref lect current econom ic, social and technological conditions. At mid-course review, the Iowa Workforce Deve lopm ent reported that it had develo ped and im plem ented a sy stem to count the n umber of children who suffer an in- jury or il lness rei mbursable under the Iowa workers' compensation laws, their ages a t the time of rei mbursable injury or illness, and the kind of work in which the y were engaged. This was an original Healthy Iowans 201 0 action step. 145.1 Action Step By 2005 and until passage, request legisla- tion to update and strength en Iowa's child labor law. (An Iowa Division of Labor Services ac- tion step.) April 2005 Chap ter 1 4 - Page 7 of 10 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Occupational Safety & Health 145.2 Action Step Through 2010, annuall y request additional staff and reso urces for publ ic education and en- forcem ent of the child labor law until thi s need is met. (An Iowa Division of Labor Services action step.) 146 Goal Statement Reduce to zero the number of Iow a adults w ho have blood-lead concentra- tions greater than or equal to 25 micro- grams per deciliter (\u00b5g/dl) of whole blood. Baseline, 199 8: 309 Iowa ns aged 16 years a nd old er had such blood-l ead concentra- tions. Ho wever; the actu al numbe r is ex pecte d to be highe r because it is base d on lab oratory reports from adults who were test ed; many adults who work in small b usinesses and con - struction do n ot have blood -lead te sting as re c- ommen ded a nd/or requi red. Rationale Further infor mation on the health effects of lead and current activities are included in the chapter on environm ental health. While goal 146 has not been met, improvem ent has been docum ented. In 19 98, 309 Iowans aged 16 and older had bl ood-lead concentrations greater than or equal to 25 \u00b5g/dl. At m id-course review, this number had dropped b y 21% to 243 i n 2003. While deteriorated lead-based paint is the major concern for lead poi soning of Iow a chil- dren, take-ho me lead exposure and prenatal lead exposure are also contribut ors. Thus, l owering adult blo od-le ad concentrations greater than or equal to 25 \u00b5g/dl has the potential to impact ex- posure of chil dren. Iowa's baseline data re- flected that 14% of children un der aged 6 had blood-lead le vels greater than or equal t o 10 \u00b5g/dl; this is t hree ti mes the national average. At mid-course review Iowa saw im provement, reporting t hat 10% of child ren under aged 6 had blood-lead le vels greater than or equal t o 10 \u00b5g/dl. While this reduction is positive, I owa has not im proved as well as other states and now is at four tim es the national average of 2.2%. 146.1 Action Step Through 2008, provide cul turally sensitive and language appropriate information about the health effects of lead and methods to reduce ex- posure to all adults reported as having blood- lead levels greater than or equal to 25 \u00b5g/dl. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health action step.) 146.2 Action Step By 2010, red uce exposures that result in workers having bl ood-lead concentrations greater than or equal to 1 0 \u00b5g/dl of whol e blood. Baseline: In 1998 i n Iowa, 639 people aged 16 and older had such bloo d-lead concentrations. Mid-course review note: In 20 03, the Iowa De- partm ent of Public Health reported an in crease from the 1998 baseline with 835 adults i denti- fied with blo od-lead levels greater than or equal to 10 \u00b5g/dl. This increase may be partially due to the previo usly mentioned 21% decrease in Iowans aged 16 and older who had bl ood-lead concentrations greater than or equal to 25 \u00b5g/dl; that is, those i n the hig her group m ay have moved into th e lower group , causing the i n- creas e in documented incidence.

The chapter committee ide ntified categories of underserved people who may have va rying degrees of difficulty in accessing dental care. They are low -income children and adults; nurs- ing h ome residents and the elderly ; children un- der age 3; children and adu lts with developm en- tal disabilities; rural residents; racial, cult ural and ethnic gr oups; and chi ldren and adu lts who either lack dental insurance or who are underin- sured. For these special populations, t here is a higher level of unm et need and an increased prevalence of oral disease. Based on available data, the most commonly identified obs tacles to better utilization i nclude lack of financial resources; lack of a perceived need or value for dental care, which affe cts mo- tivation to seek care; perc eived lack of availabil- ity of pr ovide rs; and lack of trained specialists and/or facilities. Considerable attention m ust be given t o the infrastructure of the dental service delive ry sys- tem. Doing so requires a reorganization of hu- man, organizational, info rmational, and financial oral health resources in the state. This includes buildi ng links between providers and or ganiza- tions and age ncies that work with people at-risk, such as nursing hom es, public health agencies, schools, social service agen cies, and other co m- munity -based resources. E xisting services, such as car e-coordination services for children and case management for the elderly and ot her popu- lations at risk, m ust be str engthened to assist people to overco me these barriers. Providers need to redefine how services are delivered and financed b y integrating the ir ser-vices into the community network of services. Other activities to build infrastructure include partnering with organizatio ns and institutions to prom ote program s for oral health education and services. Finally , strong le adership within and across organizations is nee ded to assess and deal with critical issues and nee ds in comm unities. This chapter is organized into goals and ac- tion steps for the targeted at-risk populations. For exam ple, most goals for im proving d ental utilization and oral health status pertain to the two populations that team mem bers identified as most at-risk f or acces s to care. They are low- income children and people over aged 65 , espe- cially those in long-term care facilities. Another goal is to increase the use o f topical fluoride by at-risk popula tions and m aintain fluori de pro- grams in area s currently fluoridated. This is the traditional public health approach of targeting populati ons most in need. A targeted approach also is necess ary be- cause of the resources and labor required for such activities as data colle ction and eva luating progress toward goals. Currently, little oral health data is available at t he state level. There- fore, m uch of the data tracking will require new data collection sy stem s that should be realistic in scope. A num ber of crosscutting issues ar e related to other Healt hy Iowans 20 10 chapters. These include nutrition, tobacco use, educational and community -based progra ms, environm ental health, injur y and/or vi olence prevention, mater- nal and child health, cancer , and diabetes. Current resea rch, for example, has reported significant links between type II diabetes and periodontal disease. One st udy found tha t peo- ple with severe periodontal disease were six times more likely to have poor g lycemic control. Another stud y showed that treatm ent of patients April 2005 Chap ter 1 5 \u2014 Page 1 of 11 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Oral Health with periodontal disease also led to im proved glycemic control. Lin ks between tobacco use, cardiovascular diseases, and periodontitis are also i mportant subjects for researchers and will provide sig nificant insight f or interventio ns and therapies for at-risk popula tions in t he future. Two original goal statem ents have been de- leted. However, the goals and action steps are either continued or addressed in other goal statements. Original goal 153, focusin g on untreated root caries in elderly, and origi nal goal 158, focusing on school- aged children receiv- ing dental exa ms and treatment, are add ressed in revised goals 15 2, 153, 157, 159, 1511, and 1513. Several of the original action steps from Healthy Iowans 201 0 are com plete and have impacted the oral health of many Iowans, in- cluding: A law was signed that req uires coverage of anesthesia and hospital cha rges for dental treat- ment for Medicaid-enrolled children; Increased to seven school-based dental seal- ant program s funded b y the Iowa Department of Public Health covering 1 4 Iowan counties; A multi-language oral health brochure was created that a lso includes inform ation on hawk-i dental insurance; A Medicaid policy change was made that now considers pay ment from Medicaid for den- tal screenings and fluori de varnish appli cations by dental hygienists as st andard of care for EPSDT screening centers; A state wide marketing ca mpaign promoted the benefit of dental sealant s; Awar eness of the school de ntal card in- creas ed result ing from a survey mailed to all Iowa schools; and Continui ng education pr ograms on geriatric dentistry were developed. The first deca de of the 21st century has been a challenging and exciting time for oral health. The team hopes this chapter challenges all pri- mary care providers to wor k cooperatively to identif y, eval uate and im plement the best strate- gies to im prove the oral health of those most at- risk now and in years to come. Goal Statements & Action Steps 151 Goal Statement Reduce cavities in primary and p erma- nent teeth so the proportion of children who have h ad one or more cavities, filled or unfilled, is no more than 10 % among children aged 3 to 5, 25 % among chil- dren aged 7 to 9, and 50 % among ado- lescents aged 12 to 14. Baseli ne: 19 94 Iowa O ral He alth Survey of sch ool children and Head Start data. Rationale Tooth decay is the single most common chronic childhood disease and affects a child' s abilit y to spe ak, eat and learn. It is an i nfectious disease that c an be prevented. Much of the fo- cus of this goal is on prevention of caries in children, part icularly through school-bas ed den- tal sealant pr ograms. School-based sealant pro- gram s have been strongl y recommended to pre- vent or control caries by the Task Force on Community Preventive Services of the Centers for Diseas e Control and Prevention. Focus is also now placed on targeting children under age five to prevent tooth decay in early childhood. 151.1 Action Step By 2010, advocate for increased st ate an d federal appropriations to al low m ore counties to have school-based sealant programs, increasing the num ber to 10. (An I owa Department of Pub- lic Health an d other intere sted oral health gro ups action step.) 151.2 Action Step By 2010, enc ourage m ore providers to par- ticipate in school-based sealant program s on an ongoi ng basis. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health, Iowa Dental As sociation, and Iowa Den- tal Hy gienists ' Association action step.) 151.3 Action Step By 2010, increase or maintain the num ber of dentists participating in the Dental Car e for Per- sons with Disabilities progr am.

Chap ter 1 5 \u2014 Page 2 of 11 April 2005 Oral Health HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision 151.4 Action Step By 2006, dev elop a parent education pro - gram by child care providers on the im portance of goo d oral health, regular care, and dental vis- its by the first birthda y. (A Head Start/E arly Head Start Or al Health Workgroup action step.) 152 Goal Statement Reduce untreated cavities in primary and permanent teeth so that the proportion of lo w-income children with deca yed teeth not filled is no more than 2% among children aged 3 to 5, 10 % among children aged 7 to 9, and 18 % among adolescents aged 12 to 14. Baseli ne: 1994 Iowa O ral He alth Survey of sch ool children and Head Start data. Rationale This goal aims to im prove acce ss to dental care and incr ease us e of dental services t o re- store teeth alr eady have the m ost difficulty acces sing dental services. The problem is multi-faceted, with changes needed in reim bursement rates f or Medicaid, rec ruitment of dental professi onals to rural areas, re cruitment of dentists to provide care for children under age 5, special needs chil- dren, and outreach to i mmigrant, m inority and refugee fa milies. 152.1 Action Step By 2010, adv ocate for Medicaid dental re- imbursement that is 90% of the usual and cus- tomary fees in Iowa to increase the nu mber of dentists participating in the dental Medicaid program . (An Iowa Departm ent of Publ ic Health, Iowa Depart ment of Hu man Ser vices, University of Iowa College of Dentistry, Iowa Dental Hy gienists' Association, and Iowa Dental Association a ction step.) 152.2 Action Step Throug h 2010, contin ue to educate dentists and dental h ygienists aroun d the state about im - provem ents and u pdates in Medicaid on an on- going basis.

(An Iowa De- partm ent of Public Health action step.) 152.5 Action Step By 2010, dev elop educatio n materials th at cover the infectious natu re of tooth decay and the passage of bacteria fro m mothers to infants, and distribute the materials throu gh the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program , maternal and child hea lth (MCH) programs, and ph ysi- cians' offices. (An Iowa Depart ment of Public Health and University of I owa College of Den- tistry action step.) 153 Goal Statement Reduce to no more than 20 % the propor- tion of people aged 65 and older w ho have lost all of their natural teeth. Base- line, 1995 Be havioral Risk Facto r Survei llance System: 28.1% of Iowans 65 and ol der lost all teeth. Rationale Among older people, loss o f natural teeth can contribute to ps ychological, social a nd physical im pairment. Even when m issing teeth are replaced with well-constructed dentures, there may be lim itations in speech, chew ing abilit y, and qualit y of life. Tooth l oss can be prevented thr ough education, earl y diag nosis, and regular dental care.

Baseline: Current system inclu des the Iowa Dep artment of Pu blic Health an nual sealant su rvey and the Behavioral Risk Facto r Surveillance System. Rationale Identification of those at highest risk for oral disease and conditi ons with appropriate targeting of resources t o treat these groups is essential for state and loca l program s. An oral health surveil- lance sy stem would help f ulfill this goal. 154.1 Action Step By 2005, dev elop a sy stem for oral health screenings of at-risk and ot her popu lation groups.

T hey include low-income children aged 3 to 5, childr en aged 7 to 9 and 1 2 to 14, childre n with special health needs, a mbu- latory elderly and long-term care reside nts, and other po pulati on gro ups. ( An Iowa Dep artment of Public Health, University of Iowa College of Dentistry , Iowa Dental A ssociation, and Iowa Dental Hy gienists' Association action step.) 155 Goal Statement Reduce deaths due to cancer of the oral cavity and phary nx in adults aged 45 to 74 to no more than 5.3 per 100,000 for men and 2.2 per 100,000 for w omen. Baselin e, 199 7: For men, aged 4 5 to 74 , 7.9 death s per 1 00,000; for wo men of the sa me age range, 3.3. Rationale As with most cancers, the earlier oropharyn- geal cancer s are detect ed, the greater the succes s in treatm ent. The highest ri sk group for oral and phary ngeal cancer is the aged 45 to 74. The goal is to increase the proportion of or ophar yngeal cancer le sions diagnosed at stage one. This would indicate that strategi es for increas ing ap- propriate screening with co mprehensive oro- have be cessful. 155.1 Action Step By 2006, dev elop a plan to educate primary care providers on the im portance of, and the pro- tocol for, oral cancer exa minations, especially for those at high risk for oral cancer.

(An Iowa De- partm ent of Public Health and Iowa Dental Hy - gienists' Association action step) 157 Goal Statement Increase to at least 75% the prop ortion of people aged 65 and older w ho ha ve had a dental examination in the previous year. Baseline, 1999, Be havioral Risk Facto r Surveillan ce System: 63.5% of Iowans aged 6 5 and old er had a dental visit in the previou s year. Rationale Becaus e many elderly people lack resources for dental care, routine dental visits are r are. An additional barrier is that dental professionals are not adequately trained to handle the special oral health needs of this po pulation. F or the elderly , medical c are often takes precedenc e over dental care, y et evidence of the link between oral dis- ease and cardiovascular and other diseases con- tinues to m ount. Also, pre scription dru gs often cause xerosto mia (dry mouth), which can lead to increased inci dence of deca y and overall m outh disco mfort. Regular dental visits provide an op- portunit y for oral h ygiene education and early diagnosis, pre vention an d treatment. 157.1 Action Step Through 2010, increase the num ber of den- tists participating in dental Medicaid b y advocat- ing for reim bursem ent rates that are 90% of the usual and customary fees in Iowa; by educating dentists aroun d the state about im provements and updates t o Medicaid; and b y educating den- tists about the dental services covered by Medi- care and how to pro perly code them for reim- bursem ent. (An Iowa Dep artment of Public Health, Iowa Depart ment of Hu man Ser vices, University of Iowa College of Dentistry, and Iowa Dental Association a ction step.) 157.2 Action Step By 2005, wor k on an ongoing basis with the Iowa Department of Elder Affairs on the im por- tance of oral health initiati ves for seniors.

This objective will be challenging. Because communities in Iowa with fluoride-deficient wat er have an average populati on of about 500, i t will require im ple- menting fluor idation in 60 communities, or six communities annuall y. Current federal preven- tive health services block grant funds ar e suffi- cient to fluori date about two to three co mmuni- ties ea ch year. If this goal is to be reache d, addi- tional sources of funds to a ssist co mmunities will need to be identified. 158.1 Action Step By 2010, advocate for increased funding for water fluoridation equipm ent. (An Iowa De- partm ent of Public Health action step.) 158.2 Action Step By 2006, dev elop a progra m to educate the public on the importance of maintaining fluori- dation, and especially about prom oting water fluoridation i n comm unities with fluoride- deficient wat er supplies. (An Iowa Dep artment of Public Health action step.) 159 Goal Statement Increase to 25 % the us e of topical fluo- rides, in addition to fluoride toothpaste, by at-risk p opulations. Baseli ne, 20 03 Medicaid -paid claim data : 11.4% of Medicaid- enroll ed pe ople received a topical fluo ride appli- cation. Rationale This goal has been broaden ed to include ad- ditional form s of topical fl uoride. T opical outh rinses can prev ent ini- tial decay and prom ote the repair of earl y stage cavities. For people at hig her risk of to oth de- cay, frequent exposure to t opical fluorid e is par- ticularly important.

Exams or screenings would b e for moderate to high-risk deca y conditions (existing or recent decay , deminera lization, vis ible plaque on anterior teeth). The profes- sionals would also counsel patients on the need to increase sources of fluoride or decrease potentially excessive sources of fluoride (such as in unsuper- vised tooth brushing). Baseli ne, 20 03 Medicaid de ntal services d ata: 5% of Medicaid- enroll ed ag ed one and u nder receive d a dental service. Rationale Evidence of early childhood cavities can appear shortly after the primary teeth erupt be- tween the age of six and 12 months. Because of this, it is recommended that children have a den- tal exa m by the age of one . However, those at greatest risk of decay are the least likely to re- ceive regular and early care. This goal focuses on reaching low-income families to prevent de- cay in the very young. 1510.1 Action Step Through 2010, increase the num ber of pub- lic health clinics that can be rei mbursed by Medicaid and the hawk-i pr ogram for dental screenings an d referrals co nducted b y dental hygienists.

Baseli ne: See Rationale. Rationale More than 51 m illion school hours are lost each y ear to dental-related i llness. Despi te dra- matic success in the reducti on of cavities in children over the past 20 years, many young children still suffer fro m oral diseases because they do not re ceive the full benefit of pri mary prevention. Many dental providers are not com- fortable treating children under age three and many parents are not awar e of the need for early care. Prevent ive services, i ncluding early diag- nosis and prom pt tre atment, can eli minate pain, infection and progressive oral diseas es.

In 2005, hardly a da y goes by without an \"obesity epi- demic\" articl e, news story , or opinion in the media. Currently, the docum entary \"Supersize Me\" is play ing in theatres, and McDonalds has added a prom otion encouraging healthier choices that include use o f a pedom eter. Ronald Mc Donald himself, now dubbed \"chief happiness officer,\" has beco me the com pany's \"ambassador for an active, balanc ed lifesty le,\" according to his Chief Creativ e Officer M arlena Peleo-La zar. Ronald now i s willing to go into schools under the guise of a \"fitness train er.\" Things have changed, but generating fu nds remains the most significant problem in prom ot- ing phy sical activity . That primary goal is now joined by some new chall enges. Those include, but are not li mited to, the t erm assigned to the epidem ic and the plethora of activities being generated, and the correspondin g need t o coor- dinate those efforts. The new top five focus area s are: Fundin g (as in 20 00); Quality school phy sical education; Coordinatio n of all efforts aim ed at seden- tary lifest yle and poor nutrition; Continued en gagem ent of partners to pr o- mote active li festy les; and Prom otion of environm and ef- forts to encourage activity . The ultim ate goal of this c hapter and the above areas i s at least 30 minutes of phy sical activity for all Iowans. The epidem ic is one of poor nutrition and inactivit y or sedentary life- style. It is recognized that many in these catego-ries are not overweight, and m any over weight people are fit. The measurements include, but are not lim- ited to: A baseline wi th 30 m inutes of activity ; Progress in minutes of school programs; Miles, weight and behavior al changes result- ing from various program s; and Policy changes and i mpact. Dramatic progress occurre d in the Am erican lifespan addition in the 20th century. During the next century , the goal is to be equally succes sful in adding even m ore years of functional life. The spirit of t his chapter is to foster m ore activ- ity for youth , the elderly , rural Iowans, all m t emporarily or perm anently dis- abled residents - in short, all Iowans. As the Ol mstead decision, a U.S. Supreme Court decision prohibiting discri mination against persons with disabi lities, is i mplem ented, more Iowans with disabiliti es will be living in communities around t he state. Barriers to their participation must be identified and reasonable accommodati on to physical activity initiated. Current efforts to make it easier to walk in communities will also acco mmodate wh eel chairs, crutches and walker s. Programs that are recognized and funded will need to reflect this effort. Toda y, more than ever, phy sical activity offers great potential for increasing a wi de range of factors that contribute to better health and additional years of functional living. Fe w, if any, initiative s combine the preventive potential and relative low cost of increas ed phy sical activ- ity. In the United States, approximately 250,000 deaths per y ear have been attributed to physical inactivit y. In 1994, sports specialist s Powell and April 2005 Chap ter 1 6 Page 1 of 13 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Physical Activity & Fitness Blair of the American College of Sports Medi- cine reported that approxim ately one-thir d of deaths fro m coronary heart disease, colo n can- cer, and diabetes wer e due to phy sical ina ctivity . The releas e of the surgeon general' s report, Physical Activity and Health , as well as other significant research, continues to point out the broad range o f beneficial effects of regular physical activity. The program s included in this chapter have the potential for reducing c ardiovascular disease, preventing various cancers, preventing a nd de- creasing injuries, i mproving m ental he alth, and slowing disease developme nt in Iowa 's aging populati on. Physical activity pro vides a rare opportu nity. The m ore recreation is available and the m ore that Iowa communities en courage walking, the more attractive Iowa beco mes for tourists. Im - provem ent in these are as can also help im prove neighbor hood safety , and r educe crime and even drug use. T he cost is low, while the pot ential health benefits are in the billions of dolla rs. Re- lated social benefits are ne arly endless. According to experts, no dr ug is as useful for sustained health as a lifeti me program of physical exercise. This is as i mportant to plan- ning in the ne xt century as it was in the 20th cen- tury. The incidence of coronary heart diseas e (CHD) is app roxim ately twice as high am ong sedentary men as am ong th ose who exercise regularly . The risk of inactivit y is onl y slightl y less than that of sm oking, high bl ood pressure, or hig h blood cholesterol. The benefit to prevent chronic heart disease alone is sufficient for an increased invest ment in the prom otion of phy si- cal activity among all Iowans. Combined with good nutrit ion, phy sical ac- tivity can hel p stem the growing n umber of overweight and obese Iow ans. Reducing obesity alone will impact a wide variety of conditions, including arthritis, cancer and stroke. O besity combined with its dem ographics makes t his a very crucial issue for Iowa. The m ost noteworthy demographic for I owa is it's rapidl y aging p opulat ion. One Iow a count y already has the hig hest national percent- age of people over aged 65 (20% ) and th e entire state will reach that level by 2020. Mor e active seniors are ap t to need less care, require l ess medical resources, and be m ore productive. Physical activity will be a major factor i n maintaining t he vitalit y of Iowa's elderly. It may also foster the vitality of the state, as re- flected in its phy sical and fiscal condition. T he benefits of phy sical activity can be realiz ed at age 8 or 80 and the activit y level of 8 0-year-olds will i mpact the qualit y of li fe of 8- year-olds. Some ethnic minorit y and low-income popu- lations are less phy sically active than the general populati on (U .S. Departm ent of Health and Hu- man Services, 1996). The physical activity ini- tiative covered in this chapter prom otes regular activity among such divers e groups as th e eld- erly, low-income Iowans, women, the over- weight, all of Iowa's ethnic pop ulations, and r ural and urban r esi- dents. This chapter includes details of a multi- faceted approach to all populations. On the community level, efforts will be made to i mpact the environm ent and encourage policies to pro- mote \"walkab le\" co mmunities that encourage acces sible recre a- tional resources. Broad-based efforts to prom ote phy sical ac- via the physical education (includi ng adap- tive P.E. courses) of children and youth, well- ness programs, co mmunity initiatives to prom ote physical activity, and m edia cam paigns will re- inforce the message that lif e-long activit y is cru- cial for all Iowans. level, support for user-based str ategies, su ch as marked routes for neighbor hoods, will be deve loped and applied at the neighb orhood level. A \"spectru m-of-prevention \" - a term devel- oped b y the C alifornia Departm ent of Health Services - wi ll be followed. This spectrum in- cludes use of indivi dual knowledge and skills; education of community members and health- care providers, such as doctors, nurses, and pharmacists; developm ent of grou ps inte rested in effecting beneficial, political action, and or- ganizational change. Such efforts will include messages to busi- nesses to develop healthy work environments and worker-wellness programs. They include Chap ter 1 6 Page 2 of 13 April 2005 Physical Activity & Fitness HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision techniques lik e those detailed in the 5+5 Pro- gram , a national program encouraging people to eat five servings dail y of fruits and veg etables and be active for at least 30 m inutes most, if not all, day s of the week. A profile of I owa shows that em ployers could save over $700 m illion a year by develop- ing phy sical activity programs, ac cording to form ulas by the Centers for Disea se Co ntrol and Prevention (CDC) and stati stics fro m the U.S. Census. The following observations fro m Promoting Physical Activity among A dults , a CDC hand- book publish ed by the U.S . Departm ent of Health and Human Services, are noteworth y. The phy sical work capacit y of an individual can be im proved b y regular ph ysical activit y. Work perfor mance is imp roved with en - hanced strength, flexibilit y and enduranc e. Regular exercise results in im proved mood, a better self-c oncept, an inc reased fe eling of well being, and dim inished anxiet y. Employers can benefit econom ically from improving the phy sical fitness of e mployees. Evidence is accu mulating that regular and habitual phy sical activity extends life. Those who are sedentary are about twice as likely to develop coronary heart diseas e (CHD) as those who are active. P eople who are seden- tary have a 4 0% higher ch ance of d ying of coro- nary heart disease than those who are ac tive. In general, th e higher the l evel of habitu al physical activity, the lower the risk for coronar y heart diseas e; but phy sical activity must be regu- lar, frequent and lo ng-term . Adults with a sedentary lifesty le have ap- proxim ately a 50% higher r isk of develo ping hypertension compared to phy sically active peo- ple. Increas ed acti vity can help prevent hy per- tension, be us eful in treating h ypertension, and may prevent t he developm ent of coro nary heart disease and other hy pertension-related diseas es. Preli minary evidence suggests that being sedentary may increase the risk of som e types of cancer, such as those of the colon and fe male reproductive sy stem . Osteoporosis is favorably i nfluenced b y physical activity, which m ay decrease th e likeli- hood of devel oping bone fractures and losing bone densit y. Physical activity can, in m any people, im- prove the course of several health proble ms, in- cluding coronary heart dise ase, diabetes melli- tus, hy pertens obesity , peripheral vascular disease, and mental depres sion. The goals of t his chapter will be achieved by gains in the qualit y and quantit y of phy sical education, be tter work-site wellness progra ms, greater collab oration between community pro- grams and res ources, more local efforts targeted to specific populations, m ore environm ental and polic y initiatives, and m ore com prehensi ve statewide campaigns. These efforts also will increase awar eness of the quality of the infra- structure for pedestrians, the ter ms of a model insurance contract, and state media messages. The rational and achievable goal of enco ur- aging all Iow ans to become awar e of these physical-acti vity goals will mean making 1% of Iowa' s sedentary popula tion m ore active during each y ear of the decade. This translates roughl y to 20,000 people each y ear. It is achievable, but before it can be reached, support - prim arily financial - must be allocated. The phy sical activity chapter tea m believes that proper funding is cruc ial to reach this goal. Budgeting 33 cents per Iowan per y ear would create a one million dollar cam paign to help stamp out the medical cons equences of phy sical inactivit y. The chapter goals proposed here can recover that dollar investment many times over. Goal Statements & Action Steps 161 Goal Statement Establish funding targeted at sedentary Iowa lifesty les and a pl an that supports planning, local efforts, environmental projects, model polic y initiatives, and education. Baselin e: See Ration ale. April 2005 Chap ter 1 6 Page 3 of 13 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Physical Activity & Fitness Rationale The Centers f or Diseas e Control and Preven- tion (CDC) developed a fo rmula that calculates the annual savings of $643 per adult in a physi- cal activity program . Ther efore, in Iowa, the annual cost for a sedentary lifesty le is over one billion dollar s. Com bined with the related con- ditions of overweight and o besity , the financial and hum an cost to Iowa is staggering and getting worse. The need for a goal to reduce these totals is crucial and beco ming m ore so. Funds re- ceived will be used to fost er partnerships, recog- nize outstandi ng efforts, and convene a multi- disciplinary conference and other initiatives. Although the message for all Iowans is that regular phy sical activity is recommende d, the rate of diabetes has tripled in the African- American population i n the past 30 years. That target audience, then, has a greater nee d to hear about the adv antages of ph ysical activit y in pre- venting an d controlli ng dia betes. Physical fitness progra ms are not the prov- ince of one or ganization. F or exam ple, in Illi- nois, the Su pplemental Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) clinics promote physical activity. Also, m ore nutrition m aterials are treating phy sical activity as a daily require- ment. And, substance abuse programs have used healthy sports program s for years to pro mote a substance-free and active lifesty le. One million dollars a y ear translates to 33 cents per Iowan, or $5 0 per targeted person. Given the impact on pu blic health, a million d ol- lars would be an appropriat e and sy mbolic su m to apply to the risk of sedentary lifesty les. The chapter team believes that all the goals detailed in this chapter require a significant and sy stem - atic change in attitude , appr oach, support , and most im portantl y, funding, for ph ysical activity . When com pared to current costs of all fac- tors resulting from a sedent ary lifesty le, a pre- vention budget of one m illion d ollars is about equal to what Iowa currently loses in 12 hours in medical cost s and lost business. Today, the ma- jority of Iowa deaths are from lifesty le-related illnesses. Chronic diseases have repl aced co mmunica- ble diseases as the most significant publi c health problem . The death rate from coronary heart disease in Iowa is 112.7 per 100,000 and from stroke 24.2 per 100,000. These, as wel l as other chronic diseases, can be si gnificantly reduced by regular phy sical activity . The prevention of just 10 heart attacks could save m ore than one mil- lion dollars. These 10 people represent .0005% of Iowa's yearly target pop ulation. More states, f rom North Carolina to Mic hi- gan to Califor nia, are equipping t hemselves to prom ote phy sical activity and increase the pub- lic's health b y creating ph ysical activit y founda- tions. The y are funding those organizations and supporting re sulting cam paigns. The A merican Heart Association, American Lung Asso ciation, and Am erican Cancer Society have all had victo- ries in their efforts to change behavior, and the risks of leading a sedentary lifesty le warrant a similar cam paign. A proper financial package could u nite ef- forts in schools, churches, work sites, and com - munities. Th ese expenditures have the potential of saving thousands of live s and billions of dol- lars by 2010. 161.1 Action Step By 2010, aggressively seek fundi ng annually from all local , state and federal sources t o fund physical activity programs in Iowa for all popu- lations. Cont inue to support the role of t he Iowa Health and Fitness Foundat ion and explore grants and the possibilit y of fundraisers.

Chap ter 1 6 Page 4 of 13 April 2005 Physical Activity & Fitness HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision 161.4 Action Step By 2005, con tinue to develop or l ocate a variety of materials that are culturally sensitive and reflect the i mportance of an active lifesty le, and distribute them to various organizations to ensure the message is e choed in a variety of \"voices\" to all Iowans. These messages will be monitored and evaluated to determ ine their ef- fectiveness. ( An Iowa Dep artment of Public Health action step.) 162 Goal Statement Certify 500 Ph ysician-based Assessment and Counseling for Exercise (PACE) cli- nicians - 5 0 of whom are doctors - or similar programs. Baseline: See Rationale. Rationale Any successful ca mpaign to encourage m ore physical activity will be gre atly enhanced by the support of pri mary care phy sicians and other clinical staff t hat counsels patients and/or cli- ents. The Phy sician-based Assessment and Coun- seling for Exercise (P ACE ) is a professi onally developed and evaluated e ffort to facilitate be- havior change. The traditional trust in primary care phy sicians and couns elors, co mbined with specific information and reco mmendations, should result in significant returns from the cost of training cu rrent and futu re ph ysicians, their staff, and oth er counselors. This two-pro nged appr oach covers current and future pr actitioners. Offering this training to those currently practicing i n Iowa will ensure that the PACE principals have a direct i mpact. Institutionaliz ing PACE in the training programs of future doctors and couns elors reaches more people and ga ins stature as an expected proce- dure (protocol). Initiatives by the I owa Medical Society and Well mark to encourage similar counseling shall also be encouraged and sup- ported, as will all efforts to encourage healthy choices. 162.1 Action Step By 2005, dev elop a trainin g program for current practitioners that will include pr ofes- sional education credit via continui ng medical education uni ts (CMEUs) to be offered at con- venient tim es and be finan cially appeali ng. (A Des Moines University , Iowa Medical S ociety , and University of Iowa action step.) 162.2 Action Step By 2006, wor k with Iowa education facili- ties to make ph ysical activity counseling part of the curriculum for clinic al staff (e.g., nurses, dieticians, phy sician assistants, etc.). (An Iowa Department of Public Health and Univer sity of Iowa Health Sciences acti on step.) 162.3 Action Step By 2005, wor k with the Io wa Medical Soci- ety, its Youth Obesity Advisory Committee, and Consensus Panel to create e ffective protocols for practitioners. This is designed to develop cul- Dep of Public Health and Iowa Medical Society ac- tion step.) 163 Goal Statement Establish an enhanced comprehensive strateg y that shares the main phy sical activity message with as man y Iowans in as man y environments as possible. This includes a w ide spectrum of resources from such areas as the Internet, neighborhood groups, and religious groups, and includes an attempt to de- velop partnerships and promotions geared toward Iow ans of all ages and backgrounds, with sp ecial attention to seniors, minorities and other special populations. Baseli ne: See Rational e. Rationale The main physical activity message will be based on the reco mmendati ons of the surgeon general's Report on Physical Activity and Health and other current resear ch. Iowans who hear a consistent message fro m the media, the I owa April 2005 Chap ter 1 6 Page 5 of 13 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Physical Activity & Fitness Depart ment of Public Health, their doctors, at school, in t heir work envir onment, at senior citi- zen centers, t heir places of worship, and other sources will be more likely to em brace th at mes- sage. Creating vers ions of the m essage for pla ces of worship and other neighborhood sites will allow a core message to be tailored to each spe- cific populati on. T he physical activity message must be heard lou dly, clearly and often by all of Iowa's diverse populatio ns. The process of developing a community pro- file has been well documented in t he 5+5 Pro- gram guide th at was develo ped b y the Iowa De- partment of Public Health. This process has al- ready proven effective in prom oting partnerships and encourag ing m ore physical activity, but much more work is needed to deliver this basic message to al l Iowans. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sy stem (BRFSS) data were reviewed in the April 21, 1999 , Journal of the American Medical Associa- tion (Vol. 281, No. 1 5 p. 1373). T he purpose was to deter mine if or how much the prevalence of phy sical activit y was associated with the per- ceived neighb orhood . This a ssocia- tion pr oved t o be true for women and the eld- erly. Conversely , perceived neighborh ood saf ety can be increased by m ore outdo or activi ty. \"Eyes on the street\" can i mpact a wide ra nge of behavior fro m watching for traffic speeders to more serious offences. By creating and prom ot- ing walking c ommunities, people can create neighbor hoods that are victorious and vibrant. More walkers can equal les s crime; in turn, less crime can prom ote more phy sical activity. 163.1 Action Step By 2010, establish a series of meetings with Iowa clergy and ot her comm unity and s pecial interest groups such as ethnic organizations, groups of vary ing ages, nei ghbor hood organiza- tions, and people with disabilities. The meetings should: By 2006, dete rmine what the groups are do- ing toward phy sical fitness and seek their input; Through 2010, share proposed literature and program s; and Through 2010, evaluate the effectivene ss of current efforts and determ ine if other su pport or meetings are needed. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health and Active Iowa Movement Foundatio n action step.) 163.2 Action Step By 2006, after receipt of funding, create a mini-grant pr ogram to provide $1, 000 to $2,000 to various, diverse organizations to create ph ysi- cal activity com bined with neighborhood efforts. The grants will be offered to churches, neighbor hood organization s, and others and be designed to c reate a wareness of the need for regular phy sical activity for all Iowans. (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health actio n step.) 163.3 Action Step By 2006, create materials that include arti- cles, brochures and program items that deal with the relationship between sa fety and phy sical ac- tivity. The materials will be designed to encour- age organizations interested in pr omoting neighbor hood environm ents to address the rela- tionship between phy sical activity and safety . (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health action step.) 164 Goal Statement Create strategies that share the phy sical activity message w ith special popula- tions, especiall y people with disa bilities, and with hi gh-risk populations. Baseli ne: See Ration ale. Rationale The traditional i mage of a fitness center is one filled with trim young bodies, those least in need of the of fered activities. This im age must change in ord er to take into account all Iowans, includin g the elderly , disabled and m inorities. The possibilit y of increased m embershi ps should make clubs interested in prom oting ph ysical fit- ness am ong these speci al groups.

I n an arti- cle for the Research Digest of the President's Council on P hysical Fitness and Sports (March 1999), Dr. Janet A. Seaman writes, \"People with disabilities can enhance the functioni ng and health of thei r heart, lungs, muscles and bones in most cases th rough reg ular ph ysical activit y. Flexibilit y, mobilit y and coordination can be improved, lessening the ne gative im pact of som e conditions or slowing the progression of others.\" Such positive social, mental and economic bene- fits exist for all Iowans and thus need to be en- couraged and facilitated for all Iowans. 164.1 Action 2010, contin ue regular comm unica- tion with fitness providers that exa mines pro- gram s on their accessibility to persons with dis- abilities. (An Iowa Depart ment of Publi c Health action step.) 164.2 Action Step By 2005, create targeted phy sical activity prom otion for low-incom e populati ons and hi gh- risk groups w ho have lim ited access to recrea- tion, highlighting available resources.

(An Iowa Depart ment of Publi c Health action step.) 165 Goal Statement Continue to recruit and improve worksite wellness programs. Baselin e: See Ration - ale. Rationale The Iowa Wellness Council is working t o make Iowa th e healthiest st ate in the nation. By developing more and better worksite wel lness program s that com plement efforts in the schools, communities, and other i ntuitions, t he council is a vital ally in the prom otion of phy sical activity . This com prehensive co mmunity model polic y other as- pects to creat e well co mmunities that encourage and support physical activity. Worksites are one of the three most crucial com ponents to creating a dynam ic environm ent that results in healthier communities and prov ides m odels for other Iowa co mmunities on the means to, and value of, healthy communities. 165.1 Action Step By 2006, dev elop a marketing plan that de- fines benefits and aggressively m arket wellness and the Wellness Council of Central Iowa via the Internet and other avenues. The Council currently has 141 m embers. The goal is to re- cruit 40 new members ann ually.

(A Wellness Council of Central Iowa action step.) 166 Goal Statement Create and disseminate a detailed list of best or expected practices that provide Iowa stude nts an educational environ- ment that teaches and fosters a health y active lifesty le. Baselin e: See Rationale. Rationale In the report of the National Centers for Chronic Disease Preventio n and Health Prom o- tion (CDCP) entitled Unrealized Preven tion Op- portunities: R educing the Health and E conomic Burden of Chronic Disease s, the followi ng statement wa s perhaps the m ost significant: \"Be- cause ingrained behaviors are difficult to change, the greatest r eturn on invest ment lies in reaching people early , before unhealthy behav- iors are adopted.\" By national n orms, Iowa bo ys and girls are slightly heavier and posses s more body fat than those in ot her states. Furtherm ore, only 56% of April 2005 Chap ter 1 6 Page 7 of 13 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Physical Activity & Fitness Iowa bo ys and 61% of Iow a girls have attained the reco mme nded health standards for cardio- respiratory fitness. For immediat e and future r eturns, it is i m- perative that phy sical activity be a regular co m- ponent i n Iowa schools. Healthy , active children not o nly perform better as students but a lso de- velop habits t hat will affect the qualit y and quantit y of their lives. Physical inactivit y is a major health hazard that for many begins during the school years. The immediat e benefit of phy sical activity is an increased suppl y of oxygen to the brain. Such activit y also facilitates the development of blood vessels that, besides oxy gen, carry other essential s - such as water and nutrients - needed for learning. Physical activity also facilitates nerve de- velopm ent an d maximum development of healthy hearts and lungs. According to the Iowa Department of Education, 13 studies on exercise and brainpow er indicate that ph ysical activit y is beneficial for developin g brains and preventing deterioration of older brain s. According to the National Health and Nutri- tion Exam ination Surve y III, 21% of adolescents aged 12 to 19 are overweig ht. As sedentary op- tions increase , efforts to encourage phy sical ac- tivity need to keep up. 166.1 Action Step By 2005, develop and distribute a database on phy sical activit y and Iowa y outh that will include a new Iowa survey of phy sical education program s and any unique or succes sful pro- gram s. (An Iowa Depart ment of Publ ic Health and Iowa Ass ociation for Health, Phy sical Edu- cation, Recreation and Dance action step.) 166.2 Action Step By 2005, provide educators with strateg ies and opportuni ties to facilitate a shift toward wellness within their own s chools and communi- ties.

It was initially deliv- ered to a list of 18 entit ies, but n ow goe s to over 50,000. T he only expense is for writing the messages - just pennies per day. 167.1 Action Step By 2007, refi ne FITNET to include an \"Iowa onl y\" list to be used to target and r efine messages, an d share other Iowa web sites will- ing to redistri bute the infor mation.

Baseline: See Ration ale. Rationale On June 9, 1 998, President Clinton signe d into law the T ransportation Equit y Act for the 21st century (TEA-21) that authorized highway , highwa y safety, transit, and other surface - transportation program s for the next six years. TEA-21 buil ds on initiative s established in the Inter modal Surface Transp ortation Effic iency Act (ISTEA) of 1991, t he last major aut horizing legislation for surface trans portation. This legislation pro vides significant fun ding for the develo pment of a lternative transportation projects that can focus on pedestrians instead of cars. The money provides Iowa with a s ignifi- cant opport unity. The chall enge is to m ake sure Iowa uses the money to encourage walking, c y- cling and recreation in gen eral. Freew ays and other transportation projec ts have discouraged pedestrian traffic. An increas- ing num ber of people are seeing the negative impact of such planni ng an d are encouraging more co mprehensive plann ing. I n this, I owa can look t o the cit y of Cedar Falls, Iowa, as a m odel of what can be done with h ighway s and recrea- tional trails. 168.1 Action 2010, contin ue regular comm unica- tion with t he Statewide Transportation E n- hancem ent Program Advisor y Comm ittee to prom ote cy cling and pedestrian optio ns. (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health actio n step.) 169 Goal Statement Create con sistent surve y items to deal with the su rgeon general's Report on Physical Activity and Health recommen- dations through measurements of the Iowa Behavioral Risk Factor Surve illance System (BRFSS) in order to form alize the measurements, increase the efforts that are measured, and publicize broadl y. Baselin e: See Ration ale. Rationale \"Sedentaris m,\" according to the June 1999 issue of the American Journal of P ublic Health , is an independent risk factor currently lacking a consensual definition. The writers of this chap- ter agree that a uniform definition is needed at the state, national and inter national levels. The Iowa Be havioral Risk Factor Surveil- lance Sy stem (BRFSS) measures a ctivity on a April 2005 Chap ter 1 6 Page 9 of 13 HI 2010 Mid-Course Revision Physical Activity & Fitness scale develop ed prior to the relea se of the sur- geon general's report. Although the BRFSS is valuable in pr ovidin g trend data, it woul d be more valuable if questions were cr afted t o reflect the 30-m inutes-per-day physical activity will allow ents to better define who is ina ctive and the degree of success that various initiatives have produced. 169.1 Action Step By 2005, wor k with the Io wa Department of Public Health's statistics bureau, the Iowa Be- havioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sy stem , and the Youth Behavior Risk F actor Survey person- nel to identif y and elim inate hurdles to consis- tent measure ment. (An Iowa Depart ment of Pub- lic Health act ion step.) 1610 Goal Statement Increase the proportion of school-age children w ho meet the Centers for Dis- ease Control and Prevention recommen- dations for ph ysical ac tivity and p hysical education. Baselin e: See Ration ale. Rationale Youth Behavi or Risk Factor Surve y 2001 Iowa data show that children fall far short of the recommendations for vi gorous ph ysical activity ity 1986 to 2 23% of all Iowans met the reco mmen dations for phy sical activity . Adults who are phy sically active had critical experience during c hildho od, including learning m otor skills (co mpetence), devel oping confidence in their abilit y to learn and perform motor skills, try ing a variet y of phy sical activi- ties, and learning the value of phy sically activity to a healthy lifesty le. Scho ol ph ysical ed ucation program s fill a vital role in developing a phy si- cally active p opulatio n. They contrib ute to, but do not fill all needs for, phy sical activit y during childhoo d. In the best case scenario, elem entary school students woul d have 30 of their 60 m inutes of daily activity in phy sical education class five days of the week. The oth er 30 m inutes would need to be pr ovided i n other programs (e.g., ex- tracurricular, reces s). On weekends an d vaca- tions, all 60 minutes of activit y woul d be out-of- school. 1610.1 Action Step By fall 2 005, educate superintendents, pr in- cipals, and school-b oard mem bers about the rec- ommendations for 150 an d 225 m inutes per week of phy sical education at the ele mentary and secondary levels from the National Associa- tion of S tate Boards of Ed ucation (NASBE), the National Association of Sc hool Boards ( NSBA), the Council o f Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), an d the CDC's Division of A doles- cent and School Health.

To increase their levels of phy sical activity and fitness, young people can benefit from : families who model and support participation in enjo yable ph ysical activity ; school programs - including quality , daily ph ysical education; h ealth education; re- cess; and extracurricular activities. These pro- gram s will help students de velop the knowledge, attitudes, skills, behaviors, and confidence to adopt and m aintain ph ysically active pro grams provid e regular oppor tunities for active, phy sical play; and youth sports and recreation pro grams offer a range of developm entally appropriate activities that are accessible and attractive to all young people.

This report focused on what was required to str engthen the p erform - ance of governmental publi c health - loc al, state, and federal a gencies. Much em phasi s was placed on the need for critical infrastruct ure to support deliv ery of public health services. In 2003, the IOM issued a follow-up report, The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century . Fifteen y ears re moved from the origi- nal, it again exa mined the state of the public health sy stem in the United States and what was required to st rengthen perf ormance. The authors broadened th eir definition of the pu blic health system to include indi vidua ls and organi zations beyond gover nmental publi c health. The follow- up report lists the following six specific changes the authors believed were necess ary to achieve the vision of \"healthy peop le in health y commu- nities\" identified in Health y People 201 0. 1. Adopt a population-b ased approach tha t builds on evidence of the multiple determi- nants of healt h; 2. Strengthen the government al public health infrastructure - the b ackbone of any public health system ; 3. Create a new generation of partnerships to build co nsensus on healt h priorities and support community and i ndividual healt h actions; 4. Develop appropriate systems of account abil- ity at all levels to ensure that population health g oals are met; 5. Assure that action is based on evidence; and 6. Acknowledge communication as the key to forging partnerships, assur ing accountabil- ity, and utilizi ng evidence for decision- making and action (The Future of the Pub- lic's Health in the 21st Century). For years, public health programs in Iowa have operated in silos at the state and local lev- els, with little incentive for communicati on among the dif ferent disciplines. The result has been a frag mented sy stem in which profession- als have lim ited knowle dge and un derstanding of the services provided and activities performed by their colle agues in different programmatic areas. Conse quently , public health m ease, substan ce abuse, public health nur sing, EMS, and laboratories. The structure of public health in Iowa com- prises the Iowa Depart ment of Public Health (IDPH), 101 l ocal boards o f health (99 c ounties and 2 cities), and m any local public health pro- viders (nongovernmental), delivering services to a population of 2.9 m illion. The local public health agencies (governmental and no n- governm ental) provide a va riety of direct ser- vices, while the state provides funding, t echnical assist ance, tra ining, and consultation. Many challenges face the state' s public health sy stem, includi ng ne w or re-emerging diseases, an aging population and public health workforce, decreased and categorical funding, an increasing i mmigrant population, a new role in planni ng for and respon ding t o public health emergenci es, inconsistent delivery of services statewide, an d a lack of pe rformance st andards or benchm arks. These and other challenges need to be addressed if Iowa' s public health sy s- April 2005 Chap ter 1 7 Page 1 of 14 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Public Health Infrastructure tem is to continue to pr otect the health of all Io- wans. Redefining and Rebuilding Iowa's Public Health Sy stem During the su mmer of 200 4, the Iowa Depart- ment of Publi c Health, under the leadership of Director Mar y Mincer Hansen, co mmissioned a work group of public health professionals to as- sess the condition of t he state' s public health system and provide recommendations for im - provem ents in efficiency and effectiveness. The work grou p has been meeting o n a monthl y ba- sis. Me mbership consists of representat ives from the following entities: Iowa Public Health Association Iowa Environmental He alth Association Iowa Association of S ubsta nce-Abuse Ser- vice Centers Directors Mental Healt h Association Local Boards of Health Iowa Department of Publi c Health State Board of Health Work Group Activities Understanding the m agnitude of its task, the work group decided early to limit initial discus- sion to g overnmental publi c health - loc al de- partments, the state depart ment, local boards of health, and the State Board of Health. Hospitals that are lead public health entities for counties through contr actual agreements with local boards of health would fall under the categor y of local departments. The decision to focus initia lly on govern- mental public health was intended to sho re-up the nucleus of the sy stem before including the other entities that pla y a critical role in deliver- ing public he alth services t o Iowans. The anal- ogy of buil ding a spider web from the inside out was used to describe th e process. The w ork, which could t ake 5-7 years, will occur in three- phases. Phase 1 Formal establish ment of work gro up through legislation, 2005 session. Asse ssment of the current public health sys- tem. Develop ment of a broad-ba sed plan for r ede- fining an d rebuildi ng Iowa 's go vernm public health system Phase 2 Engage additi onal pa rtners beyond gover n- mental public health. Establish subco mmittees t o further develop specific co mponents of a \"broad based\" plan. Identify detailed performa nce standards and/or bench marks to ensure minimum ser- vices are pro vided to all Iowans. Phase 3 Pursue necess ary legislation. Begin im plementation of the plan - a phased-in approach that allows providers to adjust to new expectations. Activities of the work grou p have focused on identif ying the bui lding blocks for re defining and rebuildi ng Iowa's go vernmental public health sy stem. The buil ding blocks will ensure the availability of critical services (public health responsibiliti es) to which each Iowan should expect to have access. In addition, the building blocks and public health responsibilities are the fram ework for the \"broad based\" plan under de- velopm ent. After much deliberation and discussion, the work grou p identified the following: Building Bloc ks (modified from North Carolina Public Health Improvement Plan: Interim Re- port North Ca rolina Public Health Task Force, 2004): Structure (Infrastructure) a nd Organiza- tion Assessment, Planning, an d Outcomes Workforce Development Accr editation Accountability Chap ter 1 7 Page 2 of 14 April 2005 Public Health Infrastructure HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Finance Public Health Responsibilit ies (modified from the Public Health Functions Steering Commit- tee, 1994): Prevent epidemics and the spread of dis- ease Protect environm ental hazards comm unities and healthy behav iors Prepare for and respond to public health threats, e mergencies and disaster s and assist in reco very process Prevent injuries Assure the quality and accessibility of health service s Similar Initiatives This is not the first ti me the improvem ent of the Iowa public health sy stem has been discussed. Ron Eckoff, MD, Dallas Count y Boar d of Health and work-group m ember, say s reports created in 1972 and 1974 by the Com prehensive Health Planning Council addressed many of the same issues. Additionall y, redefining an d re- buildi ng are an extension o f the department's \"transform ation of public health\" initiative in 2001 and 2 003. Docum ents and reports created through previ ous initiative s are being used to help guide the process. Iowa is not unique in its effort to redefine and rebuild the public health sy stem . Many states a re engaging in sim ilar activities, while others have already com pleted sy stem - improvem ent plans. Additi onall y, the Centers for Diseas e Control and Prevention recently as- sembled a Go vernmental Public Health Im ple- mentation Team to look at rebuilding the public health infrastructure as part of its \"Future s\" ini- tiative. The work group is reviewing each of these initiatives and drawing upon com ponents that can be applied to an Iowa-spe cific plan. Links to som e of the for redefining an d rebuildi ng Iowa's public health system will b e completed by Januar y 2006. The goals and action steps origi nally identifie d in Healthy Iowans 201 0, Chapter 17: Pu blic Health Infrastructure , are being discussed and a ddressed by the work group, i ncludi ng workforce devel- publi c health and accountabilit y, community needs as- sessments, an d planning. Once co mpleted, the plan to redefi ne and rebui ld Iowa's pu blic health system will b e incorporated into C hapter 17 of Healthy Iowans 201 0.

The result of Iowa' s inclusion of an asthma chapter in Healthy Iowans 2010 is fundi ng, through a com petitive process by the Iowa De- partm ent of Public Health in 20 00, from the Centers for D isease Control and Prevention to establish a statewide asth ma coalition and asthma contr ol program . The Healthy Iowans 2010 asthma chapter, co mposed in 1999, in- cluded establish ment of a statewide a sthma coa- lition and creation of a statewide asth ma pro- gram . The Iowa Department of Pu blic Health will maintain adequate funding t o conti nue a statewide, int egrated asth ma control progra m. In coordinati on with the I owa Asth ma Task Force and the Iowa Asth ma Coalition, t he de- partm ent in 2003 publishe d three docu ments that are the basis f or this m id-course revision of Healthy Iowans 201 0 chapter 18, Respiratory Disea ses: Ast hma. Asth ma in Iowa, the Plan for Im proving the Health of Iowans with Asthma; Asth ma in Iowa, Surveillance Report 1995- 2000; and Iowa Asth ma Surveillance Plan. These docu ments are avail able at: www.idph.state.ia.us/hpcdp/asth ma_cont ent. The goals in this chapter are modified from the originals, but continue to seek strengthening: The Iowa Ast hma Coalition; The Iowa Asthma Control Program and asthma survei llance; and Environm ental, clinical and comm unity - based asth ma manage ment interventions across the state. In 200 3, the Iowa Department of Publ ic Health, Center for Health Statistics, published a surveillance report with det ailed esti mates of state and, in some ca ses, co unty-specific rates of asthma: prev alence, death s, hospitalizations, and direct and indirect costs. Much of the sur- veillance data which follow are taken from that report. The Problem Globally, asthma is a growing prob lem. Prevalence (the count of al l people who cur- rently have asthma) double d in the Unite d States between 1980 and 1999. More than 20 m illion Americans, including 200,000 Iowans, have asthma. It is the m ost prev alent chronic condi- tion of t he overall U.S. pop ulation. In 200 1, 7.3% of the pop ulation, i ncluding 6.9% of adult s and 8.7% of children, had asthma (National Health Interview Surve y [NHIS ], 2003). In addition, the estim ated adult asth ma prevalence was 7.2% nationally and 6 .9% in Iowa (Behavi oral Risk Factor Surveillance Sy s- tem [BRFSS], 2001. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRF SS) provides Iowa-specifi c state- wide estimates of asth ma prevalence fro m 1999 for adults and from 2001 fo r children. A dult prevalence in Iowa has ranged from 7.7% in 1999 to 6.2% in 2003. This accounts for ap- proxim ately 145,000 adult Iowans reporting that their asth ma was diagnosed b y a doctor. The BRFSS esti mate of asth ma prevalence in chil- dren in Iowa was 5.4% in 2003 , or appr oxi- mately 40,000 children. April 2005 Chap ter 1 8 - Page 1 of 10 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Respiratory Diseases: Asthm a In 200 2, BRF SS data shows that the preva- lence of adult asth ma among Midwestern states ranged from 5.9% to 8. 8%, placing Iow a's prevalence rate of 6.6% at mid-range (MMWR, 2004). Iowa BRFSS data show that asth ma prev a- lence is highest in adults who: Are les s than 35 years of age; Have less than a high scho ol education; Have household incom es under $2 5,000 y Are female; uninsured; Are obese; or Are okers. Several studies suggest that the actual preva- lence of asthma is much higher than the rates cited here because the ra tes given are of doctor- diagnosed asthma. A rec ent study in North Carolina foun d 35% of chil dren with asthma- like sy mptoms were not diagnosed with a sthma (Arch. Ped. and A dolescent Med., 2003). 306500 418 0100200300400500600 MalesFemalesAll IowansRate per 100,000 95-97 98-00Prevalence of wa Adults(Per cent) , 1999-20 Each y ear Iowa has: 12,000 asthma-related hos pitalizations, with asthma list ed as any one of 10 adm itting or dis- charge diagnoses fro m an Iowa hospital and about half of which have asth ma listed as a pri- mary diagnosis; 15,000 to 30,000 asthm a-related 024681012 19992000200120022003Percent 1.3 m illion day s of restricted activity, in- cluding l ost days of work and school (ex trapola- tions based on national rates). According to one national s tudy of childr en, one-third of the cost of asthma could be pre- vented with b etter control of environm ental al- lergens and irritants, as wel l as better manage- ment of the diseas e by patients and their health care providers. Such chan ges would yield not only cost savi ngs but a higher qualit y of life for those with asthma and their fa milies. As indicated in the table be low, hospitali za- tion rates for asth ma (asthma listed a s either a primary or se condar y disch arge diagnosis) over- all increased slightl y betw een 1995 an d 1997 and from 1998 to 2 000, while decreasing slightly for men and increasing slightly for women (Iowa Department of Public Health, 2003). Fem ales had higher rates of hospitaliza- tion for asth ma than males for both periods. Hospitalizatio ns in Iowa with Asthma as Primary or Secondary Discharge Diagnosis, 1995-2000 Death certifi cates may list asthma as the un- derly ing (primary ) or a co ntributi ng (secondar y) cause of deat h. In the United States and glob- ally, a well-recognized increase in deaths for which asth ma was the pri mary cause occurred during the two decades 1975 to 1995. Since the mid-1990s, d eaths fro m asthma have declined slightl y in the U.S. and Iow a. Rates of death for Iowans i n which asthma was listed a s a primary cause of death were 0.9 per 100, 000 in 1970, 1.3 in 1980, 2.2 in 1990 , and 1.4 in 1999 to 2000.

An annual a verage of onl y 138 Iowans died from or with asth ma in 199 9-200 0. Of those, 133 were Cau casians and five were African-A mericans. The Well bas ed on its insurance clai ms to use for health planni ng by public health. The 1997 re- port showed wide variations in pediatri c asth ma across Iowa b y treat ment catchment ar eas, rang- ing from 7.4 to 79.7 cases per 1,000 population. The report cited a national rate of 42.5, using data fro m the MEDSTAT Group, a nati onal re- search fir m in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Based on national and state data, m inorit y and low-inco me populatio ns appear to b e espe- cially vulnerable. In Iowa, despite the fact that asthma is only slightl y more prevalent in no n- whites than in whites, African-A meric ans appear much more likely than Caucasian non-Hispanics to die from asthma. Nationally , the rate of asthma fatalities am ong African-American chil- dren is four ti mes that of their white counter- parts. The rate is six tim es higher am ong young adults. In Io wa in 1999 to 2000, the de ath rate from or with asth ma was 55% higher in African- Americans th an in Caucasi ans (5.1 vs. 1.4 per 100,000 pop ulation). To adequately address ast hma, messages and program s targeting hig h-risk po pulations must be planned, te sted and im plem ented. Also, low- income and rural fa milies may have less acc ess to health care and pu blic h ealth than urb an and higher-income populatio ns. Therefore, efforts must be made to reach these populations. Nationally , an estim ated 6 % to 9% of people with asth ma are hospitalized each y ear (900,000 to 1,350, 000); 23% (3.5 m illion) go to t he emer- gency department at least once; and 20 % (3 mil- lion) m ake at least one unscheduled asthma- related clinic visit each y ear. Of those with asthma, 32% report having lost a work o r school day due to asthma, includin g 49% of chil dren with asth ma (4.8 m illion). In 200 2, the Asth ma and Allergy Foundation of Am erica (AAFA) published Cost of Asthma , which esti mates that direct and indirect costs of the disease in the U.S. each year are $759 per person with asth ma. Dire ct costs are a ssociated with health care servic es, while indirect costs are associat ed wi th prem ature death and lost day s of work or school. Based on $759 per person with asth ma and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sy stem prevalence rates, the annual costs of asthma in Iowa are provided in t he following table.

Rationale Most of the problems caus ed by asthm a could be aver ted if people with asth ma and their health care providers m anaged the disease ac- cording to established guidelines. Effect ive management co mprises fo ur major co mponents: 1. control exposure to factors that trigger asthma episo des; 2. adequately manage asth ma with medicine; 3. monitor the diseas e by objective measures of lung f unction ; and 4. educate asth ma patients t o become partners in their own c are. 181.1 Action Step By 2010, raise co mmunity awar h to environm ental factors (e.g., open-air bur ning, tobacco s moke, etc.) that trigger asthma e pi- sodes. (An Iowa Department of Publ ic Health, American Lung Association of Illinois-Iowa, Iowa Department of Natural Resources, and Iowa Asth ma Coalition action step.) 181.2 Action Step By 2010, effectively manage the disease through use of asth ma action plans and asthma medicines, an d educate patients, health care pro- viders, and pri mary caregivers on the importance of such plans in effectively managing the dis- ease. (An Io wa Depart ment of Public Health, American Lung Association of Illinois-Iowa, Visiting Nurse Services, an d Iowa Asthma Coa- lition action plan.) 181.3 Action Step By 2010, edu cate asth ma patients throug h community awarene ss ca mpaigns and education to becom e partners in their own care. (An Iowa Department of Public Health, American Lung Association of Illinois-Iow a, Visiting Nurse Services, and Iowa Asth ma Coalition action step.) 182 Goal Statement Maintain an operational state asthma coalition. Baseli ne: See Ration ale. Rationale Coalitions at the state and local levels can be effective in c ontrolling asthma. Through a coa- lition, an allia nce of organi zations can work to- gether to achieve a co mmon purpose. Also, be- cause re sources of one agency alone are insuffi- cient to reduce the burden of asthma in Iowa, resources fro m partner organizations ca n be combined to strengthen intervention and reduce duplication. Coalitions can establish new activi- ties or enhance and expand current ones. Coali- tions also can m ore effectively provide assess- ment, im plementation and evaluation of asthma programming. Chap ter 1 8 - Page 4 of 10 April 2005 Respiratory Diseases: Asthm a HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision 182.1 Action Step Through 2010, m aintain the Iowa Asth ma Coalition wit h active membership com prised of citizens, lead ers, organizations, and i nstitutions to work to reduce the burd en of asthma in Iowa. Continue to help identify and contact agencies, organizations, health discip lines, and oth ers that should be represented on such a coalition. The coalition will meet at l east f our tim es per year. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health, Am eri- can Lung Association of Ill inois-Iowa, and Iowa Asth ma Coali tion action step.) 182.2 Action Step Through 2010, subcomm ittees will addr ess public aware ness (provider and patient educa- tion), environmental aw areness, and surveil- lance. The subcommittees will meet at l east twice per y ear. (An Iowa Asth ma Coali tion ac- tion step.) 183 Goal Statement Maintain a surveillance s ystem to define and monitor the burden of asthma in Iowa. Baseline: See Rationale. Rationale The Centers f or Diseas e Control and Preven- tion (CDC) noted that despite its i mportance, few co mprehensive surveillance sy stem s have been establis hed that m easure asth ma trends at the state or local levels. Population-based stud- ies are need ed to m ore accurately under stand the extent of this problem in Iowa. Valid data sources must be identified and tested, and refer- ent databases are needed to track incidence and prevalence on an ongoing basis. The database will support a nalytical studies that assess the association of asth ma event s with environmental conta minants and other exposures. 183.1 Action Step By 2005, ide ntify baseline prevalence by analy zing the results of the 199 9 to 2003 Behav- ioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sy stem asthma module. (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health and Iowa Ast hma Coalition Surveillanc e Com- mittee a ction step.) 183.2 Action Step Throug h 2010, use Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sy stem result s to measure t rends in asthma preval ence.

(An Iowa Department of Public Health, Universit y of Iowa, Iowa D epartment of Natural Re sources, and Iowa Ast hma Coalition action step.) 183.8 Action Step By 2005, incl ude asthma-related questions in the state Youth Risk Be havior and Y outh T o- bacco Surveys. (An Iowa Depart ment of Public Health action step.) April 2005 Chap ter 1 8 - Page 5 of 10 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Respiratory Diseases: Asthm a 183.9 Action Step Throug h 2010, contin ually provi de data and technical support to communities as they m oni- tor and evaluate the i mpact of interventi ons to reduce asth ma. (An Iowa Department of Public Health and Iowa Asth ma Coalition action step.) 184 Goal Statement Increase the proportion of persons with asthma who receive formal patient edu- cation, including information about community and self-help resources, as an essential part of the management of their condition. Baseli ne: See Rationale. Rationale The goal of al l patient education is to hel p patients take the actions needed to contr ol their asthma. Thes e actions include taking daily medications f or long-term control as prescribed, using delivery devices effe ctively , identify ing and controlling factors that make a sthma worse, monitoring p eak flow and/or sy mptoms, and following a w ritten action plan when sy mptoms or episodes occur. Therefore, it is im portant that persons with asth ma have access to quality out- patient education pr ogram s. When pro viding asthma educ ation, health professionals need to focus on 1) giving i nform ation in sim ple lan- guage and 2) teaching and demonstrating skills. Although asthma cannot be cured, children and adults can be taught the ski lls needed to control it and thereby reduce the frequency and severity of attacks. 184.1 Action Step By 2010, establish at least one school-ba sed asthma program in six school districts. Conduct ongoi ng ed ucation for scho ol adm inistrators and staff on the i mportance of school-based pro- gram s in controlling asthma. Collaborate with the Iowa Dep artment of Education to i dentify and prov ide education to sc hool districts. (An American Lung Association of Illinois-Iowa, Iowa Department of Publi c Health, Visiting Nurse Services, Iowa Asth ma Coalition, and Iowa Department of Education action step.) 184.2 Action Step By 2010, establish a child c are-bas ed ast hma training progra m in at least two regions of the state. Collaborate with Visiting Nurse Services, Child Care Resource and Referr al, and the Iowa Depart ment of Hu man Ser vices to identify and educate child care providers. (A Visiting Nurse Services, Iow a Depart ment of Public He alth, Iowa Depart ment of Hu man Services, a nd American Lung Association of Illinois-Iowa action step.) 184.3 Action Step By 2010, establish an adult-based asth ma program in at least one region of the state. (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health, Visiting Nurse Services, Iowa Asth ma Coalition, and American Lung Association of Illinois-Iowa action step.) 184.4 Action Step By 2010, establish an occupational-based asthma progra m in at least five workplaces con- sidered at-risk for exposure to environm ental triggers. (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health action step.) 184.5 Action Step Throug h 2010, include i nformation on i n- door asthm a triggers and tr igger reductio n meth- ods in educati onal m aterials for consumers, caregivers an d providers.

Chap ter 1 8 - Page 6 of 10 April 2005 Respiratory Diseases: Asthm a HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision 184.6 Action Step By 2010, red uce activity limitations among persons with asth ma through education. (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health, American Lung Association of Il linois-Iowa, and Iowa Asth ma Coali tion action step.) 184.7 Action Step By 2010, incl ude inform ation o n the use of asthma action plans in sup porting m anagem ent of the disease in educational materials. Increas e use of such plans by 25% in at least one region of the state. (An Iowa Dep artment of Public Health, American Lung Association of Il linois- Iowa, Visiting Nurse Services, and Iowa Asth ma Coalition action step.) 185 Goal Statement Raise community awareness of envi- ronmental exposures know n to trigger asthma and increase community in- volvement in primary prevention by 1) increasing the number of communities that ban open-air burning (a kno wn trig- ger of asthma) to at least 75, 2) reducing second-hand smoke through support of the tobacco chapter's goals and other educational activities; and, 3) increasing by 3% the n umber of workplaces that implement smoke-free policies. Baseli ne: See Ration ale. Rationale While the exact cause of as thma is not com - pletely under stood, nati onally comm issioned asthma panel s note that episodes are ofte n pre- cipitated by triggers such as leaf and garbage smoke, tobacco s moke, unvented gas heaters, gas cooking s toves (oven d oors left open to heat a room ), dust and/or d ust mites, mold and/or mildew, pollen, anim al dan der, and cockroach droppi ngs. H igher prevalence has also been found am ong low-income populatio ns th at lack understandin g of exp osures or the m eans to rem - edy them . 185.1 Action Step By 2010, increase community awarenes s of environm ental conditions t hat may trigger asthma episo des by: 1. Developing and distrib uting inform ation in English, S panish and large print abo ut indoor air triggers and r eduction of tr iggers; 2. Educating co mmunities on indo or air tri g- gers, includin g moisture an d mold probl ems, tobacco sm oke, dust m ites, indoor wood burning stoves, cockroach droppi ngs, and ot her known triggers; co mmunities on outd oor trig gers, includin g open burn ing, outdoor air p ollutants, weather chan ges, and other known tri ggers; 4. Presenting asthma manage ment informa tion to organizations, schools, child care facilities, workplaces, a nd other comm unity agencies; and 5. pe with disabiliti es, , women, minorities) with asth ma prevention i nformation in l anguages other than En glish and i n large print. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health, American Lung Association of Illinois-Iowa, and Iowa Ast hma Coalition action step.) 185.2 Action Step By 2010, increase the nu mber of communi- ties that ban o pen-air burni ng, a kn own t rigger of asthma, to at least 75 by 1) increasing co m- munity aware ness that open-air burning triggers asthma attacks; 2) increasi ng comm unity in- volvem ent in banning open burning ; 3) sur- veying communities to 4) a m odel ordinance for comm unities to use. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health, American Lung Association of Illinois-Iowa, Iowa Depart ment of Natural Re- sources, and Iowa Asth ma Coalition action step.) 185.3 Action Step Throug h 2010, reduce second-han d smoke conta minants through support of the tobacco chapter's goa ls and other educational activities.

April 2005 Chap ter 1 8 - Page 7 of 10 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Respiratory Diseases: Asthm a 186 Goal Statement Educate health care workers and other helping professions to w ork to ward en- hancing the overall health and well-being of people who have asthma b y 1) pro- moting use of National Institutes of Health guidelines for the diagnosis and management of the disease, 2) including information on indoor triggers and re- duction methods in educational materi- als for health care professionals, and 3) targeting homes, schools, child c are providers, and workplaces. Baseline: See Ration ale. Rationale The goal of health care wo rkers and other helping professions is to help patients learn how to manage th eir asth ma. Health car e professions should work toward enhancing the o verall health and well-being of peo ple with asthma. It is im- portant that they have acc ess to quality care. Although asthma cannot be cured, health care professionals can assi st children and adults by providi ng the skills needed to control their dis- ease, thereby enhancing the ir overall health and well-being. 186.1 Action Step By 2010, pr omote use of National Institutes of Health gui delines for th e diagnosis and m an- agement of as thma, increas ing by 10% the num - ber of health care professio nals in at leas t one region of t he state who use the guideli nes. (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health and Iowa Asth ma Coali tion action step.) 186.2 Action Step By 2010, incl ude inform ation o n indoor triggers and r eduction m ethods in ed ucational materi als for health care professionals. Include homes, schools, child care providers, an d work- places. (An I owa Depart ment of Public Health and Iowa Ast hma Coalition step.) 187 Goal Statement Support pu blic policy at all levels to re- duce the incidence and severity of asthma and increase the actions by lo- cal, city and state groups that support a reduction in asthma incidence (e.g., school inhaler legislation, open-air burn- ing ordinances and bans, smoke-free workplace policies, reimbursement for asthma education and services, etc.). Baselin e: See Ration ale. Rationale Unfortunately, som e bias and discrim ination continues in t he diagnosis of asthma. For in- stance, insurance co mpanies continue to look at asthma as a p re-existing condition. Also, many community policies, such as banning open-air burning, are initiated by local and regional pub- lic polic y makers. Althou gh asthm a cannot be cured, public polic y makers can assi st Iowans with asth ma in the m anage ment of their disease through the public po licy being initiated. 187.1 Action Step By 2010, increase actions by local, regional or state publi c polic y makers (e.g., city councils, school boards , boards of supervisors) to address indoor air problem s in schools, workplaces and public places. (An Iowa Depart ment of Public Health, American Lung Association of Il linois- Iowa, and an Iowa Asth ma Coalition step.) 187.2 Action Step By 2010, increase actions by local, regional or state publi c polic y makers (e.g., city councils, boards of supervisors) to address open-air burn- ing, a k nown asthma trigger. (An Iowa Depart- ment of Natural Resources, Iowa Department of Public Health, Am erican Lung Association of Illinois-Iowa, and Iowa Asthma Coalition action step.) 187.3 Action Step By 2010, increase by 50 the num ber of busi- nesses in one region of t he state that adopt smoke-free ordinances.

Specifically included was infor- mation on inc reasing rates of unsafe behaviors among men who have sex with men, a discus- sion of Hepatitis C as a sexually transm itted dis- ease, and more detailed information on Iowa- specific trend s. Several goals were adjusted in Section 1, Sexually Transm itted Diseases. Goal s on part- ner counseling and referral services w ere com- bined to red uce redundancy. Other goal s were adjusted or rem oved if they invol ved dire ct sur- veying of health care provi ders. The chapter team decided to either collect the information in other way s (e.g., m anaged care databases) or remove the goal entirely if no ot her m eans to the inform ation were available. Surve ys of busy health care professionals ar e difficult and rarely yield respons e rates high enoug h to su pport proper anal ysis and interpr etation. In Section 2, Human Imm unodeficiency Vi- rus Infection, goals were ad justed to focus on diagnoses of HIV rather th an AIDS. Be cause reporting of HIV diagnoses began in 1998, these data were not available when the chapter was last edited. Also, new goal s were added or ad- justed to reflect perfor mance goals for the HIV/AI DS program at the Iowa Depart ment of Public Health. These goals mea sure targets for HIV prevention, surveillance and care programs. Section 1: Sexuall y Transmitted Diseases Sexually transm itted diseases (STDs) refer to more than 25 infectious organisms primarily transm itted through sexual activity . STD pre- vention is an essential pri mary care strat egy that is integral to i mproving reproductive health. Despite the burden, costs and preventable nature of STDs and their com plications, the y remain an under-recognized health problem by the Ameri- can public, policy makers, and public health and health care professionals. The proposed objectives for 2010 reflect extensive proble m analy sis and recommenda- tions pu blish ed in 19 97 by the National Acad- emy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine in a re- port entitled The Hidden E pidemic: Confronting Sexually Transmitted Disea ses. \"STDs are hi dden epidem ics of tre mendous health and econom ic consequence in the United States. They are hidden from public view be- cause many Americans ar e reluctant to deal with sexual health issues in an open way and because of the biological and social factors asso ciated with these disease s. STDs represent a gr owing threat to the nation's health and national action is urgentl y needed....\" The principal conclusion is that the United States needs t o establish a m uch more effective national s ystem for STD prevention. Before proceeding, som e sexually transmit- ted disease te rms are defined. Bacterial and protozoal sexually transm itted disease s (ST Ds) refe r to curable sexually trans- mitted infecti ons caused ter 1 9 Page 1 of 21 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision STDs & HIV cause an infla reac tion in the host. In women, these organis ms can asc end into the upper rep roductive tract where inflammatory reactions (pel vic inflammat ory disease) c an cause irrepar able damage t o the reproductive organs. In its early stages, sy philis causes geni- tal ulcers and other infectious lesions (tissue wounds). Lef t untreated, it enters a stage that damages internal organs ov er a prolonge d pe- riod. Acute b acterial STDs in a pregnant woman can cause potentially fatal congenital inf ections or perinatal com plications such as ey e and lung infections in the newborn. There are eff ective, single-dose antim clinical presentation of sy philis varies during severa l distinct stages of the disease. Primary syphilis is charact erized by a pa inless open sore or l esion at the site of infection three to six weeks after exposure. The sore may not be visible, bu t it m ay be found i n the rectum or on the cervix. Secondary syphilis occurs in approxim ately one-third of untreated cas es two to eight weeks after the appearance of the lesion. It represents the m ost contagious stage of the disease . The most common symptom is a skin rash, m ost fre- quentl y on the palm s and soles, but also in the mouth or vagina, or o n the penis. Other sy mp- toms may include fever, malaise, loss of appe- tite, and swollen l ymph glands. Secondary manifestations resolve spont ane- ously and the disease may enter a latent period that lasts for weeks to y ears. Latent sy philis that was a cquired within the pre ceding year is re- ferred to as early latent s yphilis; all other latent cases are r eferred to as late latent sy philis. Ter- tiary syphilis may occur 3 t o 20 years after in- fection, with lesions in various tissues, such as the bones, skin, heart, nervous sy stem , and arter- ies. Partner counseling and referral services (PCRS), previousl y called contact tracing or provider referral, are servic es whereby health departm ent personnel directly and confi dentiall y notif y the sexual partners of infected ind ividuals of their expos ure to a sexually transm itted dis-ease for the purposes of testing, education, coun- seling, and referral to health care servic es. STD co mplications refer to serious health problem s following an acu te bacterial or viral STD. Am ong the m ost serious are: Pelvic infla mmatory disease (PID), whic h can cause per manent da mage to the female re- productive tra ct and lead to ectopic (located away from the normal position) preg nancy , in- fertility or chronic pelvic pain; Pregnancy complications, including ectopic pregnanc y, direct infection of the fetus or new- born, an d pre -term birth (prior to 3 7 weeks ges- tation); Cancers, such as cervical cancer (due to some strains of hum an papillom a virus) and liver cancer that ca n result from chronic infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C viruses; and HIV infection transm ission, which if ac- quired sexually, is facilitated by the presence of an inflammat ory or ulcerative STD in one or both sex part ners. Viral STDs refer to sexually transm itted vi- ral hum an immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, herpes sim plex virus t ype 2 (genital herpes), hum an papillom a virus (HPV), hepatitis B (HBV), and hepatitis C (HCV). Ini- tial with these organis ms may be ymptom atic (i.e., no s ymptoms) or cause onl y mild sy mptoms. There ar e treat ments but no cures for these infections, althoug h a small per- centage of people will \"clear\" HBV and HC V. HIV infec tion is the virus that causes AIDS. Herpes can cause periodic outbreaks of pain- ful genital lesions. Som e strains of HPV cause genital warts, while others are im portant risk factors for cervical d ysplasia (abnormal cells) and invasive cervical cancer. Althoug h Hepati- tis B virus is generally blood-bor ne, it can be transm itted through sexual activity . Mos t people who acquire it recover and have no complica- tions, but someti mes it be comes a chronic health problem and can potentially lead to cirrh osis or liver cancer. Hepatitis C is the m ost common chronic blood- borne i nfection in th e United States, with an esti mated 2.7 m illion persons chronically in- Chap ter 1 9 Page 2 of 21 April 2005 STDs & HIV HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision fected. Most infected pers ons are not aware of their infection because they are not clinically ill. However, infected persons are a source of trans mission to others and are at risk for chronic liver disease or other HCV-related chronic dis- eases for at le ast two decad es after infe ction. The role of sexual activit y in the transm is- sion of Hepatitis C virus is not full y determ ined. Several studies reported that infection with HCV is associat ed with exposur e to an infected sex partner, increasing num bers of partners, failure to use a cond om, history of STD, heterosexual sex with a male injecting drug user (IDU), sex- ual activities involv ing tra uma, and male-to- male sex. However, studies of long-ter m sero- discordant couples (i.e., on ly one partner is posi- tive for HCV) show very l ow rates of sexual transm ission between partners (0% to 4% ) when no ot her risk factor is present. The generally recognized sy mptomatic STDs that may cause only mild initial illnesses are only part of a ver y large public health prob- lem. These o rganis ms also cause many other harm ful, often irreversible and costl y, clinical complications such as reproductive heal th pro b- lems, fetal and perinata l health problem s, and cancer. Also, studies of the Human Immunode- ficiency Viru s (HIV) pandem ic from around the world link other STDs to a causal chain of events in the sexual trans mission of HIV infec- tion. STDs are beh aviorally linked disease s that result from unprotected sex with infected part- ners. Trans mission of STDs is sustained by the complex interaction between biol ogical and so- cial factors. Biological factors include the lack of sy mptoms of the m ajority of STDs, th e long period between infection and STD complica- tions, and ana tomical factors that make adoles- cent females and m en who engage in un pro- tected rec eptive anal intercourse with other men particularly vulnerable. Most STDs ei ther do not produce sy mptoms or mptoms. People ve as- ymptom atic or m ild infecti on often are unaware of it. The y need, but often do not seek, medical care. As many as 75% of women and up to 5 0% of men with Chlam ydia ha ve no s ymptoms. Most people are not aware of how frequ ently STDs are a symptomatic. Many falsely believe that the y can tell if a potent ial sex partner is in- fected. Likewise, many infected persons fail to recognize their infections and fail to take precau- tions that would prevent diseas e trans mission to their sex partners. There is often a long i nterval (so metimes years) between acquiring a sexually trans mitted infection and the recognition of a clinically sig- nificant health problem . Examples ar e cervical cancer caused by the human papillom avirus, liver cancer caused by hepatitis B virus infec- tion, and infe rtility and ect opic pregnancy result- ing from unrecognized or u ndiagnosed C hlamy- dia or go norrhea. The orig inal infection is often asymptomatic and, as a res ult, there is frequently no perceived connection be tween the original sexually acquired infection and the resulting health proble m. Gender and age are as socia ted with an in- creas ed risk for STDs. Women are at hi gher risk of acquiring most STDs, as are men who have unprotected anal intercourse with other men. For som e STDs, y oung w omen are more suscep- tible der women. Cervical ectop y (vul- nerability ), in which the cervix is covered with cells that are especially susceptible to STDs (e.g., Chlam ydia), is common in adolescent fe- male s. The cervices of older wo men have fewer of these cells. Also, traumatic sexual practice s predispose one to STDs. This has been well docum ented f or receptive partners during rectal intercourse in men and women. In the case of many youn g women who report their fir st inter- course as involuntar y, sexual trauma to the ex- ternal and internal genitalia may also predispose one to an ST D. Social and cultural factors may also directly affect the spread of STDs, especially in popula- tions in whic h hig h-risk sexual behavior is common, acc ess to health care is li mited, and/or healthy behav ior is com promised. Dispropor- tionatel y affected populati m ay include cer- tain m inority groups; peopl e who exchange m oney , drugs or fa vors; adolescents; persons in jails; and migrant workers. Substance abuse, racis m, distru st of medical care, s exual norms, stigma, ac cess to drug treatment or clean nee- dles, and cult ural views of sexuality , gender roles, hom osexualit y, and bisexuality are major April 2005 Chap ter 1 9 Page 3 of 21 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision STDs & HIV social and cultural factors that may prom ote the spread of STDs. Increasing rat es of primary and secondary syphilis have been reported am ong men who have sex with men in New York Cit y, Seattle, San Francisc o, Los Angeles, Chicago, Mia mi, and a num ber of other citie s nationall y and in- ternationall y since 1997. I nvestigations of these outbreaks indicate that an increasing num ber of men who have sex with men are participating in high-risk sexual behaviors that place them at risk for HIV and other STDs. Rates of HIV co- infection am ong these men ranged from 20% to 73%. Factors cited in the increas e in unsafe be- haviors include the availabilit y of highl y effec- tive treat ments for HIV infection that have de- creas ed the perceived thre at of HIV to men who have sex with men. Acce ss to high quality health care is es sen- tial for early STD detection and treatment, as well as for receiving couns eling about behavior changes to reduce contracting or transfe rring STDs. Frequently, gro ups with the hig hest rates have lim ited acce ss to heal th services. High quality STD s ervices need t o be provided in health care programs that serve poor peo ple and those with marginal health care. Many studies docum ent the associ ation of STDs with substance abuse, especially alcohol and drug use. The appearance of new illicit sub- stances in co mmunities can often dram atically alter sexual behavior in hi gh-risk sexual net- works, leading to the epidemic spre ad of STDs. Other substances, including alcohol, m ay affect people's j udgment before and d uring sex , lower- ing the li kelihood t hey will protect themselves against STDs and pregnan cy. Biological studies dem onstrate that whe n other STDs are present, a person' s susceptibility to HIV infection is increased. Also, the risk that a person would contract bo th HIV and another STD and infect other peopl e with HIV is in- creased. Conversely , effective STD treatm ent can slow the spread of HIV. The early detection and treatm ent of other STD s can substantially reduce HIV tr ansmission. Trends STDs are among t he most frequentl y re- ported infectious diseases and are a significant health proble m in Iowa. The qualit y of STD data is lim ited. It is de- pendent upon which provi der or facility is re- porting. Race is not reported for a large num ber of cases. Al so, the reporte d incidence of STDs may reflect the de mographics of people seeking care at a parti cular facility or may reflect the practices of c ertain provide rs. Only case s with laboratory confirmation of disease may be re- ported, which may not necessarily reflect the characte ristics of all infected people. More wo men than m en are m ore reported to have STDs. Becaus e of the nature of speci men collection, women are ofte n tested for STDs as a routine part of a pelvic exam , while men are generally tested onl y if they have s ymptoms or are a partner of someone who tested positive. This often results in a higher num ber of cases diagnosed an d reported among fem ales, particu- larly for thos e diseas es in which men ar e likely to be asy mptomatic (e.g., Chlam ydia). Federally funded screening has occurred in Iowa since 1994 as part of t he Region VII Infer- tility Preventi on Project (II PP). Its main pur- pose is to implem ent prevention, i ncluding screening, that will reduce the com plicati ons caused by Chla mydia trachomatis. The project targeting wo men fro m the beginni ng be cause the complications associ ated with women are more costly , wom en acces s servi ces more read ily, and by screening women, partners can be treated. Approxim ately 88% of th ose tested in Iowa are female. S creening for Chlam ydia is offered to all sexually active wo men under aged 25. Women over aged 25 can receive the tes t if the y have certain risk factors, such as new or m ultiple partners in th e last 90 da ys, contact with an in- fected partner , or symptoms of disease. Currently, 70 clinics are en rolled in t he pro- ject. Most are fa mily planning clinics, but STD clinics, student health centers, correctio nal fa- cilities, co mmunity health centers, and non-Title X wo men's health centers are also enrolled. Late in 2002 , two alternative high school clinics, the Indian Health Service, and the Scott and Muscatine Count y jails, were added. Family Chap ter 1 9 Page 4 of 21 April 2005 STDs & HIV HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision planning clini cs perform 76% of the testing for the Infertilit y Prevention Pr oject.. The pr oject reported 3,3 72 persons with Chlam ydia in 20 03, or 52% of all reported of Chla mydia in Iowa. Chlam ydia: Chlam ydia is the m ost reported STD in the U.S. and in Iowa. In 200 3, 6,462 cases (219.0 cases per 100,000 populati on) were reported to th e STD prevention pr ogram . Since 1996, reporte d cases incr eased by over 55%. The increase extends to both m ales and fe males, but the largest increase was am ong females. Females account for the majority of Chla mydia cases, with the ratio of m ales to fe males has been consistent since 1996 at one male for every three females reported. Chlam ydia cases ar e disproportionatel y dis- tributed m inority groups. When stan- dardized for populati on si ze, black, non - Hispanic males have an incidence rate o f re- ported cases t hat is more than 33 tim es that of white, non-Hi spanic males. Black, non- Hispanic fe males have a ra te that is 12 times that of white, no n-Hispanic females. The rate am ong Hispanics is more than four tim es that of white, non-Hispanic persons. Gonorrhea : In 2003, 1,544 case s of gonor- rhea (52.4 cases per 100,000 population) were reported. Nu mbers have increased for four con- secutive y ears, although levels are still below those before 1996. Nearly all of the inc rease in cases since 1 999 are am ong fem ales. Black, non-Hispanic males and white, n on- Hispanic females account for the largest propor- tions of gonorrhea cas es. Black males have con- sistently outnum bered black fem ales. This is the reverse of wh at is generally expected and of what is seen with Chla mydia. Overall, Black, non-Hispanic persons acco unt for t he largest proporti on of gonorr hea cases (40% ) despite comprising o nly 2% of the pop ulation. Syphilis : Syphilis, like over- representatio n in m inorit y populati ons. Those diagnosed wit h early syphil is tend to be older than those dia gnosed with gonorr hea and Chla- mydia. In 200 3, 12 primary and secondar y and 5 early latent cases of sy philis (0.6 cases per 100,000 population) were reported to the STD prevention program in Iowa. Early syphilis morbidity in Iowa is now at its lowest level since the diseas e beca me report- able in the late 1940s. I owa has the opp ortunit y to elim inate endem ic syphilis, which is one of the program 's most im portant objectives before 2010 . Goal state ments and action steps in this sec- tion are ai med at reducing illness and death by preventing cases and co mplications of STDs such as sy philis, ydia trachomatis, and the severe co mplicatio ns of pelvic infla m- matory disease. Since both y and ulcerative STDs facilitat e the transm ission of HIV, treating these conditions lowers the risks of HIV and is also a chapte r objective. Goal Statements & Action Steps 191 Goal Statement Reduce the incidence of Chlam ydia tra- chomatis to no more than 140 per 100,000 population. Baseli ne: 199 8, 178.2 per 10 0,000; 2003, 21 9.0 p er 100,0 00. Rationale This action step can be achieved by the e x- pansion of sc reening progr ams to reach people at higher risk. They include people aged 1 5 to 24, minorit y populations, those in the juvenile jus- tice sy stem , and ot her high -risk yout h. 191.1 Action Step By 2010, conduct case inte rview and contact 50% follow-up rate for all reported Chlam ydia cases, an increase fro m 32% in 2003. ( An Iowa Department of Public Health action step. ) 191.2 Action Step Through 2010, m aintain Chlam ydia screen- ing at 70 infe rtility prevent ion pr oject provider sites and screen up to 60,000 peop le annuall y. April 2005 Chap ter 1 9 Page 5 of 21 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision STDs & HIV (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health action step.) 192 Goal Statement Reduce the incidence of gonorrh ea to no more than 43 cases per 100,000 people. Baselin e: 199 8, 58.2 per 1 00,000; 20 03, 52.4 per 10 0,000. Rationale Reduction in gonorr hea can be achieved b y improving ac cess to health care by minority populati ons and education to help peo ple recog- nize sy mptoms and seek t reatment quickly when symptoms ap pear. 192.1 Action Step By 2010, ens ure that 80% of all reported gonorr hea cases receive an interview and fol- low-up, an i ncrease fro m 59% in 200 3. (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health actio n step.) 192.2 Action Step Throug h 2010, maintain gonorrhea screen- ing at 70 infe rtility prevent ion pr provider sites and screen 60,0 00 pe ople annuall y. (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health actio n step.) 193 Goal Statement Eliminate transmission of primary and secondary syphilis. Baseli ne: 199 8, 0.9 per 100,00 0; 200 3, 0.4 per 10 0,000. Rationale The early stages of syphili s cause recogniz- able genital ulcers and other infectious lesions. Left untreate d, syphilis enters a latent phase that damages the internal organ s over a prolo nged period. Detecting and treating s yphilis i n its early stages prevents the patient' s illness and transm ission to others. 193.1 Action Step Throug h 2010, contin ue to conduct inter - views and follow-ups on 100% of locatable pri-mary , secondary and early latent sy philis cas es, the sam e as in 20 03. (An Iowa Department of Public Health action step.) 194 Goal Statement Maintain the number of public health ju- risdictions w ith popula tions of 50,000 or more that have at least one dedicated sexuall y transmitted disease clini c that provides comprehensive, sexuall y transmitted disease ca re. Baselin e: See Ration ale. Rationale Many people will not seek STD/HIV diag- nosis from their primary physician. By main- taining the number of publi c health jurisdictions with pop ulations of 5 0,000 or m ore that have at least one dedicated STD cli nic, m ost peo ple statewide will have access t o confidential diag- nosis and treatm ent. 194.1 Action Step By 2010, maintain the ST D Prevention Pro- gram to supp ort local STD testing and tr eatment at local publi c health clinics in jurisdictions with populati ons o f 50,0 00 or more. The clin ics must have laboratory supplies, la boratory services, and treatm ent drugs. W hen partner noti fications are not maintained by loca l jurisdictions , they should be pro vided b y the I owa Department of Public Health disease prev ention specialists. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health action step.) 195 Goal Statement Establish a baseline for the proportion of sexuall y active women under aged 25 who are screened annuall y for Chl amy- dia and gonorrhea in primary health care settings. Baseli ne: See Ration ale. Rationale For curable treatme nt can be cost-saving, by the p eriod duri ng which infected per- Chap ter 1 9 Page 6 of 21 April 2005 STDs & HIV HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision sons can infect others. Screening for STDs clearly meets the criteria for effective pr even- tion. F or frequentl y asymptomatic STDs, screening and treat ment also benefit thos e likely to suffer the severe co mplications (espe cially women) resul ting from undetected infect ions and late treat ment. For exam ple, Chla mydia screening in a large metropolitan managed-care organization reduced the incidence of subsequent pelvic inflammatory disease s in the Pacific Nort hwest. The diseas e was reduced by 60% in fi ve years. When com - bined with a new generati on of sensitive and rapid diagn ostic tests, so me of which can be per- formed on a urine speci men, STD screeni ng of specific high-risk pop ulatio ns in no ntradi tional settings appears to hold promise into th e next decade. Chlam ydia rates am ong men are highest in those aged 20 to 24. While there is insufficient evidence to reco mmend for or against routine screening in all sexually active men, in situa- tions where asy mptomatic Chlam ydia ening m ay be reco m- mended to prevent spread of the infection (U.S. Preventive Services Task F orce, 1996). 195.1 Action Step By 2005, con tact two managed-care organi- zations in Iowa to collect baseline data on the proporti on of women aged 15 to 25 wh o are be- ing screened for Chlam ydia in accordance with the HEDIS measure for managed care. (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health actio n step.) 195.2 Action Step By 2007, dist ribute infertili ty prevention project broch ures and fact sheets about the im - portance of screening, partner referral, and treatment for Chlam ydia to provi ders in t wo managed care organization s. (An Iowa Depart- ment of Publi c Health actio n step.) 196 Goal Statement Establish a baseline for the proportion of pregnant women screened for STDs dur- ing prenatal health care visits. Baseline: See Ration ale. Rationale Early diagnos is and treatment of STDs can prevent future and present co mplications for mother and child. 196.1 Action Step By 2006, dev elop a questio n on t he Women' s Health Inform ation Sy stem 's (WHIS) maternal he alth surve y asking whether the mother w as screened for STDs during her preg- nancy . (An I owa Depart ment of Publ ic Health action step.) 196.2 Action Step By 2007, establish a baseline for the num ber of pregnant w omen screened for STDs d uring pregnanc y, as measured b y the Wom en's Health Inform ation Sy stem 's (WHIS) maternal health survey . (An I owa Department of Publ ic Health action step.) 196.3 Action Step By 2010, publicize and dissem inate resu of the Wom maternal health survey . (An Iowa De- partm ent of Public Health action step.) 197 Goal Statement Establish a baseline for the number of youth dete ntion facilities and adult city and/or county jails in w hich screening for common bacterial STDs is conducted within 24 h ours of admission. Baseli ne: See Ration ale. Rationale Youth and ad ults in detenti on and correction facilities have some of the highest rates of STDs in Iowa. Screening, treatment and couns eling for this popul ation will have the greatest impact on disease if done in a tim ely fashion so that clients receive counseling and treatm ent prior to releas e. 197.1 Action Step By 2010, survey all yout h detention facili- ties and adult city and c ounty jails for routine April 2005 Chap ter 1 9 Page 7 of 21 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision STDs & HIV screening of co mmon STDs upon entr y. (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health actio n step.) Section 2: Human Immunodeficiency Virus The overall goal for HIV is to prevent its transm ission and associated illness and death by ensuring that: 1) all persons at risk for HIV in- fection know their serostatus; 2) those n ot in- fected with H IV remain uninfected; 3) those in- fected with HIV do not transm it HIV to others; and (4) those infected with HIV are accessing the m ost effective therapies possible. Before proceeding furt her, some definitions are needed. AIDS : Acqu ired immune deficiency syn- drom e is the most sever e phase of infection with the HIV. People infected with HIV are said to have AIDS when the y get one or m ore of 26 AIDS indicator diseases (o pportunistic infec- tions and certain cancers) o r when their CD4+ cell count drops below 200 cells/m icroliter or 14% of total l ymphoc ytes. Antiretrovir al drugs : Medications used to kill or inhibit the m ultiplication of retroviruses (viruses that store their genetic informati on on a single-stranded RNA molecule instead of the more usual double-stranded DNA). General class es of drugs include nucleoside rever protease inhibitors (PI), and a new class c alled entry in- hibitors (EI). CARE Act : The Ry an White Com prehen- sive AIDS Re sources E mergency (CARE) act, the prim ary federal legislat ion that addre sses the health and su pport needs of people livin g with HIV/AI DS, a nd their fam ilies. Enacted in 1990, the CARE act was re authorized in 1996 and amended in 2000. CD4+ cell count : A t ype of T cell (also known as T4 or T helper cells) that protects against viral, fungal and protozoal infections. These cell s normally orche strate the i mmune response, signaling ot her cells in the imm une system to per form their fu nctions. Because HIV infection kills these cells, t heir num bers provide a good wa y to track the pr ogress of an HIV in- fection. A hi gher num ber usually m eans better health. The CD4+ cell co unt is an indicator of which oppor tunistic infections a patient i s at risk for developin g. CD4+ cell counts for he althy adults range from 401 to 1, 532 cells/m icroliter. HAA RT: Highly Active, AntiRetroviral Therapy is a combination of protease inhibitors and reverse tr anscriptase in hibitors used in treat- ing AIDS and HIV infection. It is also referred to as co mbination therapy . High-risk behavior : A be havior in a high prevalence se tting that places an individual at risk for HIV or STDs or in any setting i n which either partner is infected. HIV : Hu man imm unodeficiency virus is the virus that causes AI DS. HIV Diseas e: A term used to encom pass all stages of HIV infection, inc luding AIDS. The term, \"Per sons with HIV diseas e,\" includes peo- ple with HIV infection who have not developed AIDS, as w ell as people with AIDS. HIV pr event ion counseling : An intera ctive process between client and counselor aimed at identif ying concrete, ac ceptable and appr opriate ways to reduc e risky sex an d needle-sharing be- haviors related to HIV acquisition (for HIV- uninfected clients) or transmission (for HIV- infected clients). HIV pri mary medical care : Evaluation and clinical care that is consistent with U.S. Public Health Service guidelines for the treat- ment of HIV/ AIDS. Such care must include access to antiretrovirals and other drugs, prophy- laxis and treatm ent of ortunistic infe ctions, and com bination antiretroviral therapies. Opportunisti c infections : Infections that are either bacterial, fungal or vital and ta ke the opport unity offered when a person's im mune system has be en weakened by HIV infection. Serostatus : The result of a test for the anti- bodies that th e imm une sy stem creates to fight specific dise ases. Seropositive : Indicates that a person' s blood contain s antibodies t o HIV. It's d iagnos- tic for HIV infection in per sons older tha n aged Chap ter 1 9 Page 8 of 21 April 2005 STDs & HIV HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision 18 m onths. Maternal antibodies m ay persist in newborn infa nts for up to 18 m onths; h owever, they do not indicate HIV in fection in the infant. Transmi ssion: HIV is spread most com- monly by sexual contact with an infected part- ner. The virus can en ter the body through the mucosal lining of the vagin a, vulva, peni s, rec- tum, or, rarely, the m outh during sex. T he like- lihood of tran smission is in creased by factors that may damage these linings, especiall y other sexually trans mitted diseases that cause ulcers or inflammation. HIV also is spread throug h con- tact with infected blood, most often b y the shar- ing of drug needles or sy ringes contam inated with m inute quantities of bl ood containing the virus. Children can contract HIV fro m infected mothers durin g pregnanc y or birth, or af ter birth, through breastfeeding. In developed countries, HIV is now rarely transm itted by transfusion of blood or blood products because of scr eening. Unmet n eed for health services : The need for HIV-relat ed health services of people with HIV who are awar e of their HIV status b ut are not receiving HIV pri mary medical c are. Viral load (or viral burden): Refers to a measurement of HIV particles in the blo od. Vi- ral load tests are reported a s the num ber of HIV copies in a m illiliter of blood. A high vir al load indicates that HIV is reproducing and t hat the disease will likely progress faster than if the vi- ral load were low. A high viral load ranges fro m 5,000 copies t o one m illion or m ore. A l ow viral load is usuall y between 50 to 50 0 copies, de- pending on the type of test. This result i ndicates that HIV is not reproducin g and that t he risk of disease progression is low. Undetectable viral loads mean that the HIV virus in the blood is below the level needed for detection by this test. It does not indicate absenc e of the virus. It may also be helpful to focus on the effect HIV/AI DS has on the Unite d States in the con- text of terms that are co mmon to other Healthy Iowans 20 10 chapters. Cost effec tive: Means tha t dollar cost of an intervention c ompare favorably to life-saving interventions of other diseases, usually less than $50,000 per q uality-adjusted life year saved. Cost saving : An interventi on that saves more in averted health care expenditures than it costs to im plement. Culturally appropriate : Conform ing to a culture' s acce ptable expressions and standards of behavior a nd th oughts. Interventions and educational materi als ar e more likely to be cul- turally appropriate when representative s of the intended audi ence are involved in p lanning, de- veloping and testing them . Disability : An indicator of the extent t o which people are forced to cut back on their ac- tivities. Altho ugh people with asy mptomatic HIV can go about t heir bus iness routinely, the degree of HIV-asso ciated disability can range from slight to severe. Diversity : Difference s in race, ethnicity , gender, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, age, phy sical abilities, religious beliefs, political beliefs, health or disease status, or other ideologies. The concept of diversity encom - passes acceptance, respe ct, and the understand- ing that each person is unique. Evidenced-b ased : A description of beh av- ioral, social and structural risk-reduction strate- gies that have been tested and shown t o have a methodologic ally rigorous design and to be ef- fective. Also called scienc e-based, the s trategies have been evaluated using behavioral or health outcom es and have been com pared to a c on- trol/com parison gro up (or pre-post data without a comparison group if a policy study ). They have not been biased in assigning people to in- tervention or control gr oups or adjusted for an y apparent assi gnment bias. They have also pro- duced signifi cantly greater positive results when compared while produci ng no e: A measure of the num ber of new cases rep orted in a gi ven period, us ually within a year. Because HIV infection often is without clear early symptoms, most peo ple fail to recognize their infection for som e time, often years. For that reason, incidence is often used to indicate new infections rather than new diagno- ses or ca ses reported. It is estimated that ap- proxim ately 40,000 new HIV infections occur each y ear in the United States. April 2005 Chap ter 1 9 Page 9 of 21 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision STDs & HIV Intervention : A specific a ctivity (or set of related activities) inte nded to change the knowl- edge, attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, or pra ctices of indivi duals and p opulatio ns to reduce their health risk. An interv ention has distinc t process and outcom e objectives and a protocol outlining steps for i mplementation. Morbidity : The ter m often used in place of \"illness\" or \"disease. \" In HIV, it is usually measured in illnesses that are part of a group referred to as AIDS-indicat or diseases. Mortality : The num ber of deaths of per- sons with AIDS or with HIV diseas e. There has been a marked decline in the num ber of deaths among peopl e with AIDS nationall y since 1996. The data suggest that new therapies, along with the success of com prehensi ve prevention begun in the 1980s, not only are delay ing progression from diagnosis to death but , with early diagnosis and treat ment are also helping dela y progression from HIV inf ection to AIDS for m any people. Prevalence : The num ber of people wh o are infected at any poi nt in t ime and living with HIV disease. B ecause HIV inf ection is not reportable by nam e in all states, the num ber of persons with HIV in the United States c an only be esti mated, ranging from 850, 000 t o 950,000. In I owa, the number with HIV infection or AIDS is estim ated to be between 1,42 5 and 1,545. Approx imately one-fourth of them don't know the y are infected. As the num ber of new AIDS cases has st abilized and the num ber of deaths began to decrease, the number of people livin g with HIV in Io wa rose nearly 50% between 1998 and 200 3. Increased prevalence underscores the increasing need for medical and other services for people wi th AIDS, and the im portance of contin ued preven- tion to reduce new HIV/AI DS infections. Priority pop ulation : A p opulatio n ide nti- fied throu gh an epidem iological profile and community services a ssessment that requires prevention because of high infection rates and risky behavio r. Refe rral: A process by which immedia te client needs for prevention , care and supportive services are assessed and prioritized. Clients are helped to ide ntify and access s ervices. Survival rate s: The time that elapses be - tween a perso n's infection with HIV and death. The HIV or AIDS survival rate has bee n of in- terest to rese archers fro m the earliest da ys of the AIDS epidemic. Much is t houg ht to co ntribute to a person's abilit y to sur vive after infection, and the abilit y am ong people to stay alive seems to vary considerably . Som e appear to get sick quickl y and die quickl y while others have re- mained sy mptom-free for nearly 20 years. Many researchers believe that receiving good medical c are and treat ment with the new com bi- nation therapies may extend a person' s time and qualit y of life after infection. The HIV/AIDS epidem ic is a relatively re- cent public h ealth phenomenon in t he United States and globally . The diseas e was first rec- ognized in t he United States in 1981 and in Iowa in 19 83. In the early years, a majori ty of AIDS cases occurred in men, with onl y 5% occurring in fe- male s in 1982. In late 1982, cases of AI DS traceable to blood transfusi ons were first re- ported in the United States . Very soon thereaf- ter, interagency recommen dations to prevent AIDS were published, wit h specific guidance for blood donatio ns. As the nation conti nued to learn more ab out AIDS and HIV disea se, pre- cautions and guidelines co ntinued t o be devel- oped. Recommendations were designed to pro- tect health ca re workers an d to test donated blood . In late 1985, recommendations for the prevention of AIDS in the workplace and in perinatal transm ission were published. By the early 1990s, m any changes in th e epidem ic were apparent. AIDS was being re- ported from every state and m ost large ci ties. Nationally , the proporti on of AIDS cases in white hom osexual m en declined, while t he pro- portion in m inorit y men and women began to increase. It a lso appeared to be increasing among injecting dru g users and their part ners. In the late 1990' s, an international increase in syphilis a mong men who have sex with men indicated that increasing num bers of hom osexual and bisexual men were en gaging i n high-risk behaviors that place the m at risk of acquiring or transm itting HIV. In Iowa, AID S case s have been reported from 93 of 99 counties. Th e ten most populous counties (>50,000) account for 70% of t he cases, Chap ter 1 9 Page 10 of 2 1 April 2005 STDs & HIV HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision even though t hey account for less than 50% of the pop ulatio n. On Jul y 1, 1998, Iowa beg an reporting per- sons with HIV by nam e, including thos e without AIDS, and reporting labor atory results i ndicative of HIV infection or AIDS. Before, onl y persons with AIDS were required to be reported. HIV reporting by name in Iowa helps: 1) im prove the abilit y to trac k the epidem ic; 2) provi de data to design targeted preventio n and/or interve ntion and care program s; and 3) identifies sexual and needle-sharing partners who m ay have been ex- posed to HIV and helps the m get counseling, testing and tr eatment. Since the earl y 1980s, it ha s beco me clear that there are at least four distinct HIV/A IDS epide mics of public health significance: 1. An epidem ic among men who have sex with men, facilitat ed by frequent changes of sex part- ners in highl y infected sexual networks and high-risk sexual practices; 2. An epidem ic among injecting dru g users and their sexual partners, facilit ated by peopl e shar- ing with infected bloo d; 3.

A perinatal e pidem ic among infants caused by undetected and untreated HIV infection in pregnant wo men. According to the MMWR, Feb. 28, 1997: \"In 19 96, for the first time, deaths am ong per- sons with AIDS decreased substantially in the U.S. This de creas e in AID S deaths refle cts both the leveling o f AIDS oppor tunistic infection (OI) incidence and im proved clinical survival among persons with AIDS. This declin e reflects the com bined impact of the com prehensi ve pre- vention effort s instituted in the 1980s, which have helped slow the epidemic in recent years, and the success of new therapies in lengthening the healthy life span of people with HIV. At the same ti me, there has been a substantial increas e in AIDS prevalence. \"Prevalence is a function o f both t he rate of new infections and the dura tion of illness. The increase in A IDS prevalence refle cts declines in AIDS deaths and stable AIDS incidence . The increased pre valence of AI DS indicates the need for medical a nd other services for perso ns with HIV infection and for preve ntion progra ms to reduce the nu mber of persons becom ing infected with HIV.\" HIV disea se, like other affe cts po pulatio ns disprop ortionately. u nder- the i mportance of plementing and sus- taining effective prevention for comm unities of color. HIV prevention m ust take into account the m ultiracial and m ulticultural nature of soci- ety and other social and econom ic factors that impact health , such as und erem ployment, pov- erty, mental and phy sical disabilities, and poor access to the health care sy stem. As people live longer due t o recent advances in HIV diagnostics and therapeutics, the lifeti me costs of health care for HI V have grown from $55,000 t o $155,000 or m ore per person. HIV prevention can be cost-effe ctive and even result in a cost savings to society. Prevention includes 1) counseling , testing, referral, and partn er coun- seling and referral; 2) health education a nd/or risk reduction ; and 3) i nformation for clients at high risk. Interventions to com bat HI V are bio medical and behavioral. Recent ad vances in antiretrovi- ral therapy have been credited with dramatic declines in death due to HIV and AIDS. How- ever, declines in AIDS incidence and preva- lence, particularly in early centers of the epi- demic such a s San Francis co and New York, predate antire troviral therapies and support the view that behavior-based prevention is effective. In San Francisco, for example, AIDS among men who have sex with men began dr opping i n 1992 , suggest ing that sustai ned, com prehensive prevention st arted in the 1980s succeeded in re- ducing HIV t ransm ission. Behavioral interventions v ary nationwid e, depending on the audience, the designer and fundin g. The most successful strategies of the Iowa HIV Co mmunity Planning Group include indivi dual an d grou p cou nseling and testing, street and community outreach, and use of opin- ion leaders. Interventions most often reco m- mended are t hose that are highly interactive, ap- proach peopl e where they congregate, are rein- April 2005 Chap ter 1 9 Page 11 of 2 1 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision STDs & HIV forced over ti me, and focus on behavi or change or changes in group social norm s. Following t he 1994 fi nding that perinat al HIV transmission could be substantially reduced with zidovu dine (AZT), the Public Health Ser- vice issued guidelines making HIV coun seling and vol untar y testing part o f routine pren atal care for all pregnant women. This p olicy en- sures that HI V-infected w omen have ac cess to important health care for the mselves and the opport unity to reduce the risk of transm ission to their infants. Subsequent declines in diagnoses of AIDS among childr en offer hope that these strategies are being successful in reducing m other-to- infant transm ission. From 2000 to 2004, there were 30 births to HIV-infe cted wo men in Iowa. Two of these infants tested positive, five remain indeterm inate pendin g further testing, and 2 3 were HIV negative. The t wo HIV-positive in- fants represen t failures in prenatal HIV t esting for the m other. Am ong HIV-positive women who were on antiretroviral therapy , there have been no HIV-positive infants born in Iowa. Trends Diagnoses of HIV in Iowa am ong U.S-born persons have been steadily decrea sing since 1996 . In 2003, just o ver 60 U.S.-born Iowa residents were diagnosed with HIV. Diagnoses of HIV am ong non-U.S. bor n persons have increased 250% since 1999, and accounted for 31% of all di agnoses in 2003. In 1996 , that pr oportion was onl y 5%. Fore ign- born persons with HIV are more likely than U.S.-born per sons with HIV to be fem ale, mi- norit y (black or Hispanic), and heterosexual or with an unide ntified risk. Most HIV diagnoses in Iow a occur in ma les and people ag ed 25 to 44. However, data indi- cate that most people are not being diagnosed early in the course of infections. Half of people diagnosed wit h HIV in 200 1 were subsequentl y diagnosed with AIDS within a year. Age at di- agnosis, therefore, may not indicate age at infec- tion. Over half of people diagn osed with HIV in 2003 were white and However, African-American, non-Hi spanic fe males; and His- panic males a re much m ore severely impacted by HIV. African-American, non-Hispanic per- sons in Iowa have a 10-fol d higher prev alence of HIV AIDS th an white, non -Hispanic persons. Hispanic people have a 4-fold hi gher pr evalence than white, n on-Hispanic people. Fifty percent of people wit h HIV or AIDS as of Decem ber31, 2 003, reported m ale-to-m ale sexual contac t (MSM) as their prim ary risk. Fifteen percent reported he terosexual contact; 12% were injection drug users (IDU), and 7% reported both IDU and MSM. Another 2% were transfusion or transplant recipients; 1% reported hemophilia, and 1% had pe diatric exposures. Twelve percent had n o risk identified. Diagnoses of AIDS declined from 1992 throug h 1998, but r ose to approxim ately 80 di- agnoses in 1999 and have been steady since then. The inc rease after 1998 can be attributed to diagnoses am ong foreign-born persons, mostly Hispanic males and African fe males. AIDS deaths reached a low in 1998 and have leveled off near 30 deaths p er year. The m ost significant feature of Iowa' s HIV epide mic is t he substantial increase in the num - ber of person s with HIV and AIDS. St eady di- agnoses of HIV infection, com bined with wide- spread use of highly active, antiretroviral thera- pies that have delay ed the onset of AIDS and deaths, have increas ed the num bers with HIV to unprecedented levels. 198 Goal Statement Reduce new cases of AIDS amon g ado- lescents and adults to no more than 2 per 100,000 persons. Baselin e: 1998, 2.5 cases; 2003, 2.5 ca ses. Rationale Diagnoses of AIDS include those who are receiving their first HIV diagnosis late in the course of their infection, and, therefore, repre- sent late testing and m issed preventio n opport u- nities. New AIDS diagnoses al so include those with previous HIV diagnoses for whom treat- ment has not been adequate or has failed.

Baseli ne: 3.4 ca ses per 100,00 0 persons in 2 001; 3.1 ca ses per 100,000 person s in 20 03. Rationale The num ber of new diagnoses of HIV i s the best measure of the progression of the epide mic in Iowa and nationally . The Centers for Disea se Control and Prevention hav e set a national goal of reducing t he num ber of new infections by 50% by the year 2005 thr ough i ncreasin g the proporti on of at-risk persons who consistently engage in beh aviors that reduce risk of HIV ac- quisition or transm ission. 199.1 Action Step By 2010, m onitor trends in diagnoses s o prevention and treat ment can be targeted at those most in need. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health action step.) 199.2 Action Step By 2010, im and high-risk seronegative persons, as designated in th e Iowa HIV Com- prehensive Plan and as developed b y the HIV Community Planning Gro up. (An I owa De- partm ent of Public Health action step.) 1910 Goal Statement Increase to 67 % the proportion of sexu- ally active students who report using a condom during the previous three months. Baselin e: In 1998, 48% of student s who h ad sexual intercou rse durin g the p reviou s three mo nths used a co ndom, accordi ng to the Youth Risk B ehavioral Survey. In 2003, the proportion had rise n to 64 %. Rationale Data on the effectiveness o f latex condoms in preventing HIV are clear . The y are highly effective barriers to HIV when used consistently and correctly . Carefully designed studie s among heterosexual couples in wh ich one partn er is HIV-positive and the other is not dem onstrate that latex condom s provide a high level of pro- tection against HIV. Increased condom use is essential for s lowing the spread of HIV infec- tion. 1910.1 Action Step By 2010, seek input from young adults in roundtable sessions on condom knowledge, atti- tudes and beh avior. (An Io wa Department of Education an d Iowa Departm ent of Publ ic Health action step.) 1910.2 Action Step By 2010, incr ease annually the num ber of health teacher s who teach how to correctly use a condom . According to the School Health Edu- cation Profile (SHEP), 49% of health teachers taught correct condom use in 20 00, while the rate fell to 44 % in 2003 .

Base- line, Iowa Yo uth Risk Beh avior Survey (YRBS) and Sch ool Health Education Profile (S HEP): 1997, 93%; 2 003, 87%. Rationale AIDS education in grades 1 thro ugh 12 is required unde r Iowa Department of Education, Chapter 12, General A ccreditation Standards, 281-1 2.5 (356) 10 ( 5). Ho wever, school districts and/or school boards decid e how to im plem ent the education. According to the School H ealth Education Profile (SHEP), 92% of the lead health educa- tion teachers survey ed in 1998 i ndicated that they taught a bout HIV/AIDS in their required health education classes. I n the sa me survey, principals ind icated that HIV and/or AIDS edu- cation is primarily taught i n 7th and 8th grades (middle school), 7th to 10th grades (junio r and senior high), and 9th and 1 0th grades (se nior high). Less than 50% indicated that information about HIV/AIDS was given in 12th grade. 1911.1 Action Step By 2010, monitor the resul ts of the Iowa Youth Risk B ehavior Surve y and the Sch ool Health Education Profile ( SHEP) survey. (An Iowa Department of Education action step.) 1912 Goal Statement Increase the proportion of clients of state-funded HIV testing sites who are referred for screening for common bac- terial STDs such as s yphilis. Base line: See Rationale. Rationale Recent data i ndicate that other STDs sub- stantially increase the risk of HIV trans mission. Treating them reduces H IV trans mission. In the United States , STD rates ar e high and STD clinical servic es are inadeq uate in the face of a changing HI V epidem ic. Closely coor dinating or integrating HIV prevention and STD preven- tion is a necessary and cost-effective w ay to re- duce trans mission of both, according to the rec- ommendations of the CDC's Advisor y Commit- tee for HIV a nd STD Prevention. Early detection and treatment of curable STDs should beco me a major, explicit co mpo- nent of com prehensive HIV prevention pro- grams at the national, state and local levels. 1912.1 Action Step By 2006, im plem ent a newly developed data management tool to collect inform ation on refer- rals at state-funded HIV test sites. (An Iowa Department of Public Health action step. ) 1912.2 Action Step By 2008, establish a baseline for the per- centage of clients who are referred for STD screening. (An Iowa Dep artment of Public Health action step.) 1912.3 Action Step By 2010, incr ease the capacity of couns elors to refer clients for STD scr eening when appro- priate. (An Iowa Depart ment of Publ ic Health action step.) 1913 Goal Statement Increase to 1.0 % the pe rcentage of ne wly identified, confirmed HIV-positive test results b y state-funded HIV counseling, testing and referral sites (CTR). Baseli ne: In 1998 an d 2003, 0.4% of tests were po sitive. Rationale Knowledge of serostatus has been correlated with a person' s willingness to change high-risk behavior and, therefore, has received sig nificant attention in both programming and research. Chap ter 1 9 Page 14 of 2 1 April 2005 STDs & HIV HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Providers need to ensure that HIV testin g is readily availa ble to at-risk populati ons. Strate- gies include u sing rapid HI V tests, offering o ut- reach testing by comm unity-based organizations, and routi ne voluntar y testi ng in high prevalence medical s ettings, such as emergency rooms. 1913.1 Action Step Through 2010, m onitor HIV-positive test results at counseling, testing and referral sites.

Baseline: To be estab - lished; see a ction step s. Rationale The goal of t he Partner Counseling and Re- ferral Services (PCRS) is t o stop the uninten- tional spread of HIV throu gh risk-reduct ion edu- cation to people who are infected and to their partners who may have been exposed to HIV. The service helps partners gain earlier a ccess to counseling, H IV testing, medical evaluation, treatment, and other preve ntion services. 1914.1 Action Step By 2006, im plem ent a newly developed data management tool to collect partner serostatus measurem ents.

Rationale As of December 32, 2 003, injecting dru g use was directly or indirectl y involved in HI V transm ission for 24% of Io wans with HIV. Of these ca ses, 7 8% were inje cting drug us ers (in- cluding t he risk category men who have sex with men/injecting drug user) while the rem aining 22% were sex partners of i njecting dru g users or newborns inf ected by their m others who were injecting dru gs or partners of injecting d rug us- ers. Drug treatm ent and risk re duction progr ams should be off ered to reduce the risk of HIV in injecting drug users. Specifically , acces s to ster- ile sy ringes, which is the m ost cost-eff ective way to reduce HIV a mong injecting drug users, should be increased. HIV counseling and vol un- tary testing of injecting dru g users shoul d also be prom oted so the y are aware of their status.

Bas eline: Curre nt law mandate s HIV testing on intake to the corre ctional system. Rationale Incarceration provides an e nvironm ent in which early intervention a nd risk reduct ion be- haviors can b e taught and r einforced over time. It also provid es an opportu nity to provide the support and continu ity of care when in mates are releas ed. Early acces s to care reduces i mmedi- ate and long-t erm health care costs for correc- tional institut ions and the c ommunity . State prison s ystems provide access to treat ment and care to people with HIV. 1916.1 Action Step Throug h 2010, monitor legislation to m ain- tain testing requirements in prison s ystems. (An Iowa Department of Corrections and Iowa De- partm ent of Public Health action step.) 1917 Goal Statement Increase to 90 % the proportion of county jails in cou nties with populations over 50,000 that regularl y screen all inmates for HIV. Baseline, 2004: Of the 8 jails locate d in high po pulation co untie s, 2 provide d routine scree ning a nd 6 allowed testing u pon p hysician or inmate reques t. Rationale Count y jails provide an en vironm ent in which at-risk populati ons can be easily accessed for testing, early interventi on, and reinf orcement of risk reduct ion behavi ors. Routine screening would identif y people earlier who may not adm it to risks and/o r who m ay not have develo ped symptoms. 1917.1 Action Step By 2010, wor k with count y partners to pr o- mote regular screening of all inmates at count y jails in counti es with popul ations over 5 0,000 in order to contr ol the spread of HIV am ong count y jail inmates. (An Iowa Depart ment of Public Health action step.) 1917.1 Action Step By 2010, secure state funding for expanded HIV testing in count y jails in count ies with populati ons o ver 50,0 00. ( An Iowa Dep artment of Public Health action step.) 1918 Goal Statement Increase to 100 % the p roportion o f new tuberculosis (TB) cases in people aged 25 to 44 who have their HIV status re- ported. Baseline, 200 3: 100% of the 13 per- sons aged 25 to 44 had the ir HIV status reporte d to the Iowa Departm ent of Public Health . Rationale The rate of progression from latent tubercu- losis (TB) to active TB disease among HIV- positive patients is greatly accel erated o ver that seen for non- HIV infected persons. A national TB-AIDS case registry match for 19 93 - 1994 showed that 22% of TB cas es in the 25 to 44 age Chap ter 1 9 Page 16 of 2 1 April 2005 STDs & HIV HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision group also had HIV infection. (Th is is likely a minim um due to matching methodologi es.) Since 1982, I owa has had 22 cases of HIV- TB co-infection. Earl y detection of HIV in TB patients also allows early intervention a nd treatment that may prevent or delay the d evel- opment of other HIV-rel ated illnesses and AIDS. In fact, many people who a re diagnosed with TB-related to com promised imm unity caused by HIV are unaware of their HIV status. Tubercu- losis patients receive HI V testing only after counseling and inform ed consent from the pa- tient. Becaus e testing is voluntary , som e pa- tients may decline HIV testing. T he Iowa De- partm ent of Public Health and the Centers for Disea se Control and Preve ntion (CDC) collect data on reported TB case s that have information on HIV status. 1918.1 Action Step By 2010, monitor clients who have tub ercu- losis and offer them an HI V test. (An Iowa De- partm ent of Public Health action step.) 1919 Goal Statement Increase the percentage of HIV-infected persons w ho are receiving regular pri- mary HIV m edical care. Baseli ne: To be establi shed; see actio n step. Rationale The Centers f or Diseas e Control and Preven- tion estimate that approxim ately one-thir d of persons diagn osed with HIV are not receiving HIV pri mary medical c are. Primary medical care includes access to antiretroviral and other drug t herapies, proph ylaxi s and treatm ent of o p- portunistic in fections , and regular medical evaluation. T he year 2 000 amendments to the Ryan White CARE A ct require states to deter- mine the size and needs of t he popu lation of people who k now their HIV status but who are not receiving HIV-rel ated medical c are so that national resources can be better targete d. HIV-infect ed persons are c onsidered to have an unm et nee d for care (or to be out-of-care) when there is no evidence they received any of the following three co mponents durin g a defined 12-m onth period: viral l oad testing, CD4+ cell count, or antiretroviral therapy . 1919.1 Action Step By 2005, estimate the nu mber of people who know the y are infected but are not in care by surveillance data and through contact with health care providers.

( An Iowa Dep artment of Public Health action step.) 1920 Goal Statement Reduce HIV mortality to no more than 0.4 per 100,000 persons. Baselin e: 1998, 0.6 per 10 0,000; 2003, 1.0 pe r 100,000. Rationale In 1998, m ortality among persons with HIV disease in Iowa was the lowest since 1986. Since then, deaths have ris en to approximately 30 per year (1 .0 per 10 0,000) but have h eld steady since 2000. The re latively low mortality rate, despite c ontinuous inc reases in the num ber of persons with HIV, reflec ts acc ess to a ntiretro- viral therapies before 2004 . In Ma y 2004, the AIDS Drug Assist ance Pr ogram , pay er of last resort for antiretroviral th erapies, was for ced to close to new enrollees. Iowa is one of a few states that ha ve no earmar ked funding from the state for the program .

(An Iowa Department of Publi c Health actio n step.) 1921 Goal Statement Decrease the percentage of persons di- agnosed with AIDS w ithin a year o f their HIV diagnosis. Baseli ne: 1998, 41 %; 2002, 46%. Rationale Data on the time between HIV diagnosis and AIDS can be used to give a general idea of the status of the disease at first HIV diagnosis. This is often used as a measur e of late or delay ed test- ing, but m ay also reflect p oor access to care. A short period between HIV diagnosis and AIDS suggests that a person may have been infected for some ti me. People with early HIV diagnoses (i.e., soon aft er infection) generally have longer spans betwee n HIV diagnosis and AIDS . People who get into treatment quickl y, respon d well to therapy , and/ or adhere to t reatment regimens also have a longer period between HIV diagno- sis and AIDS . 1921.1 Action Step By 2010, monitor the i nterval between an initial diagnosis of HIV infection and AIDS di- agnosis to affect a decr ease in late diagnoses of HIV. (An Iowa Department of Pu blic Health action step.) 1921.2 Action Step By 2010, incr ease the capacity of couns el- ing, testing a nd referral sites in order to reach higher risk p opulations, using new testing tech-nologies like rapid testing, to affect a de creas e in late diagnoses of HIV. (An Iowa Depar tment of Public Health action step.) 1921.3 Action Step By 2010, prom ote rapid ac cess to HI V pri- mary care cli nics for newly diagnosed persons through partner counseling and referral s ervices (PCRS) to affect a decr ease in late diagnoses of HIV.

(An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health action step.) 1922 Goal Statement Eliminate HIV acquired perinatall y. Base- line: 1998, 1 ca se; 200 3, 2 cases. Rationale The National Institutes of Health sponsored an AIDS clinical trial, ACTG-076, that w as stopped early in 19 94 after it showed tha t the risk of perina tal HIV transmission could be re- duced by as much as two- thirds with the use of zidovudi ne (AZT). It was given to women dur- ing preg nancy and child birth and to the newborn for six weeks after birth. Additional research confirmed that routine and universal counseling and vol untar y testing, combined with an tiretro- viral therapy , are highly effective in preventing perinatally acquired HIV. In 199 6, an I owa De- partm ent of Public Health task force recom - mended that all pregnant women receive educa- tion o n HIV prevention an d risk reducti on as early as possible in the pre natal period. Also, that voluntar y testing is off ered if there are risk factors or if wo men reque st the test. Although the incidence of perinatally - acquired HIV infection in I owa is low, continu- ing the following strategies are ne cessary to en- sure that HIV -infected women don' t pass the disease to the ir children. The strategies are: 1) adequate prenatal car e and ti mely HIV counsel- ing and voluntary testing; 2) ready acces s to Chap ter 1 9 Page 18 of 2 1 April 2005 STDs & HIV HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision HIV-rel ated care and ser laxis 4) avoidance of breastfe eding. 1922.1 Action Step By 2010, monitor the ann ual incidence of perinatally -acquired HIV. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health action step.) 1922.2 Action Step By 2010, incr ease the proportion of women who receive a n HIV test during pregnanc y as measured by the Wom en's Health Information System 's (WHIS) maternal health survey and the Barriers t o Prenatal Ca re Survey. In 2003, 50% of 5,5 26 respondents t o the WHIS surve y indicated they had been te sted for HIV.

So me 100,000 people die each year in t he United States as a result of alcohol and illicit drug use, and rel ated acquired immu- nodeficiency syndrom e (AIDS) account for at least another 12,000 deaths . Also, nearly 14 million Americans, or one in every 13 a dults, abuse or have been diagnos ed with substance dependence or abuse. Several million m ore adults practice risk y drinkin g that could lead to problem s with alco- hol or other s ubstances. Such behaviors include binge dri nking and heav y drinking . A reported 53% of Amer icans say that one or m ore of their close relatives have a drink ing pr oblem . Substance abuse, alcohol abuse, and de- pendenc y are significant pu blic health pr oblems that have hig h econom ic costs. It costs every man, wo man and child in the United States nearly $1,000 annuall y to pay for health care, law enforce ment, m otor vehicle crashe s, crime, and lost productivity due to substance abuse. The esti mated societal cos t of drug abus e in this countr y in 1998 was $148 billion f or productiv- ity losses, related particularly to incarceration, crime, drug abuse-related i llnesses, and pre ma- ture death. Substance abuse, including tobacco use and nicotine addiction, is associated with a variety of other serious health and so cial problems. Epi- demiological evidence reveals that 72 conditions requiring hospitalization are wholl y or partially attributable to substance abuse. Not every one chooses to dr ink alcohol. Of those who do, m ost have li ttle or no tr ouble lim - iting their i ntake to am ounts that produc e no se- rious health or social consequences. Millions of other Americans, however, consum e alcohol i n quantities and frequencies that place them and others at risk for alcohol-related disease, crime and uni ntenti onal injuries. People who drink even relatively low am ounts of alcohol contrib- ute to alcohol -related death pational associ ated with m ore than 45% of all motor vehicle d eaths. Available data indicate that roughl y one-third of victim s of homicide and suicide, and 22% of victi ms of fatal boating accidents, we re intoxicated at the time of death. In additi on, the triggering effect of alcohol co nsum ption in sexual assault and victim ization has been documented b y both ex- perimental an d population-based rese arch since the late 1970s . People aged 60 and older also face risk s for alcohol-related prob lems, althoug mparatively low amounts of alcohol. However, \"adverse alcohol- drug i nteraction can be a major problem that causes hospital ad missions am ong older patients, since many older patients take multiple medica- tions. In addition, m any cases of memory defi- cits and dem entia now are understood to result from the eff ects of alcoholis m....\" (Healthy People 201 0). In 199 7, the Iowa Department of Publ ic Health conducted the Iowa Substance Abuse Prevention N eeds As sessment: Public Surve y and in 1 999 published the Iowa State Pl an for Substance Ab use Prevention (state plan). Ac- cording to the survey, risks at the individual level, such as attitudes favorable to the use of alcohol, toba cco and other drugs, as well as peer use, were dire ctly associated with actual sub- stance use be haviors for adults and children. Other variables not include d in the risk a nd protective are as are also as sociated with sub- April 2005 Chap ter 2 0 - Page 1 of 25 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Substance Abuse & Pr oblem Gambling stance use be haviors, such as job stress a nd money worries. Iowa's Drug Control Strat egy and Plan, the first of its kind, was the collaborative work of the following state agencie s: Office of Dru g Control Policy (ODCP) Iowa Depart ment of Corrections (IDOC) Iowa Department of Econom ic Develo pment (IDED) Iowa Department of Education (IDOE) Iowa Department of Hu man Rights - C rimi- nal and Juven ile Justice Planning (IDHR - CJJP) Iowa Depart ment of Hu man Services (IDHS) Iowa Department of Publi c Defense - Iowa National Guard (the National Guard) Iowa Department of Publi c Safety - Go ver- nor's Traffic Safety Bureau (IDPS) Iowa Department of Publi c Health (IDPH) Iowa Department of Transportation (I DOT) Workforce Development (WD) The strategy and plan, along with the Iowa Youth Survey, form the basis for many of the goals and obj ectives of this chapter. Since the Healthy Iowa 2000 process began, a disparity of services for I owans with different risks of addiction has been recognized. As a result, specifi c treat ment programs incre ased for women with children, young girls, an d youth . Culturally specific programs continued and are a continui ng fo cus. Special populati on an d ethics training also continue to be certification re- quirements for prevention s pecialists and treat- ment counselors. In additi on, treatment and pre- vention expanded due to the steady increase of metham phetamine use and abuse. Materials in many languages are also more available, suc h as in Spanis h, Asian languages, and Braille. The Iowa Substance Abuse Infor- mation Center (ISAIC), a clearinghouse for in- formation materials, is working with immigra- tion services to m ake translation m ore av ailable. For exam ple, the Iowa Ga mbling Treat ment Program has brochures in Spanish and 11 Asian languages, and its media cam paign is designed to appeal to multiple cultures and socioeconom ic groups. Othe r media camp aigns b y ISAI C are designed to reach multiple cultural groups and are adaptable to local needs. Disparity still exists, however, and will re- quire diligenc e and collaborative efforts to be successfully recognized and addressed. Funding must continu e in order to e xpand ISAIC's cul- turally specific information and other resources, and to m ake those materials available to the pub- lic. Interpreters are also needed at the point of service; howe ver, there is currently no funding to pa y for their use. Chapter 20 team mem bers recognize the importance of cultural competency in the provi- sion and administration of services to su bstance abuse and pro blem gam bling patients. C hapter 12: Mental Health and Mental Disorders also reflects significant changes in Iowa' s popula- tion. Stead y growth occur red during the past five y ears in the Latino/Hispanic, Africa n- American, As ian, Pacific Is lander, and Eastern European communities. The needs of these populati ons are specific an d varied, and sub- stance abuse and prob lem gambling req uire on- going, s ystematic cultural c ompetency . The Iowa State Plan for Substance Abus e Prevention deter mined other disparity -specific targets for increased preven tion. These include women of childbearing age and senior citizens, as well many of the K-12 s ubstance abuse cur- ricula such as Drug Abuse Resist ance E ducation (D.A.R.E.) that is developed outside Iow a but implem ented extensively here and geared for Caucasi ans. It is not yet cost-effective for publishers of these materials to develop materi als gea red for other grou ps. Fundi ng for their develop ment has moved fro m the substance abuse field to those involved with violence prevention, m ental health treatment, and crim inal jus tice. Problem gambling was not addressed in Healthy People 2000 or Healthy Iowans 2000 - or the original draft of Healthy People 2 010. However, with the growth of legalized gam bling across the co untry and the wide variety of gam - bling availabl e to Iowans, a pattern showing the relationship b etween gam bling and su bstance abuse is developing . The Iowa Be havioral Risk Factor Surveil- lance Sy stem (BRFSS) annually surve ys about Chap ter 2 0 - Page 2 of 25 April 2005 Substance Abuse & Pr oblem Gambling HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision 5,000 households b y telep hone. T he survey is designed to c ollect information on health risk behaviors to monitor prevalence among Iowa residents aged 18 an d over . Three gam bling questions were added in 19 98: Have y ou gambled in the l ast 12 m onths? Has the money you spent g ambling led t o financial prob lems? Has the time you spent gambling led to problem s in your fam ily, work or personal life? Approxim ately one-thir d of respondents admitted to gam bling in the previous year. Around 1% experienced problems in finances or relationships, a consiste nt percentage si nce 1998 . In 2003, however, 1 .6% of respon dents who had gambled in t he past 12 m onths said the money they spent gam bling led to fi nancial problem s; and 1.7% report ed the tim e spent gambling led to problems in fam ily, wor k or personal life. The BRFSS data reflect the results of an Iowa prevale nce study (Volberg, Rachel A., Gam bling and Problem Gam bling in Io wa: A Replication Surve y, Des Moines, Iowa, Iowa Depart ment of Hu man Ser vices, 1995). This survey of Iow ans aged 18 and ol der indic ated more than two-thirds had gambled in the previ- ous 12 m onths. Iowa estimations align with prevalence rates through out the world an d show 1% of Iowans to be current probable path ologi- cal gam blers, while 2.3% are current problem gamblers. This 3.3% total amounts to about 72,600 adult Iowans (2000 census) who exhibit signs of pro blem gam bling. \"Current\" means meeting the criteria in the past 12 m onths. The essential features of pa thological gam- bling i nclude 1) a continu ous or periodic loss of control over ga mbling; 2) a progression in gam - bling freq uency , amounts wagered, preoccupa- tion with gambling, an d obtaining m oney with which to gamble; and 3) a continuatio n of gam - bling i nvolvement (DSM-IV, A 1994). The t erm \"problem gam bling\" refers to people who f all short of th e diagnostic criteria for pathological ga mbling but are assu med to be in a prelim inary stage in the developm ent of such patholo gy. Indeed, the essential featur e of pathological gambling r ecurrent behavior that d isrupts per- fam ily be preo ccupied with gam - bling and continue to gamble despite efforts to control or stop it. The y may \"chase\" losses, make increasingl y larger be ts, or take greater risks to undo earlier loss es. The y may lie to conceal the e xtent of gam bling and resort to an- tisocial behavior such as forgery , fraud, t heft, or embezzlement. Problem gamblers may also engage in \" bail- out\" behavi or, turnin g to family or other s for help with a desperate finan cial situation caused by gambling (See 312.31 Pathological tion: Diagnos tic and Statistical Manual of Men- tal Disorders, 4th Edition, Washington, D.C. American Ps ychiatric Association, 1994). The Diagnostic a nd St atistical Manual M edical Dis- orders , 4th Edition (DSM esti mates the prevalence of patholo gical gam bling ran ge to be from 1% to 3% of the adult pop ulation. In the 20 02 Iowa Youth S urvey, 1% of re- spondents said that m oney bling led to financial prob lems; and 1% said that the time spent gam bling led to problem s in fam ily, work, school, or per sonal life. Th e data indicate a need to inform youth about the ri sks of gam bling to o much. Growing up in a state where ga mbling is so acce ssible makes preven tion ke y to avoiding the costs of excessive ga mbling. According to Iowa Gam bling Treatment Program data for 19 98-2001, 23% of cli ents in gambling treat ment reported the y had received treatment for a drinkin g and/or dru g problem, and 61% reported using tobacco. Thus, the title of this chapter now include s problem gam bling. People affected b y problem gambling may lose excessive am ounts of m oney and engage in behavior that damages personal, fam ily and v o- cational pursuits. Identif ying the hidden natu re of problem gambling is a necess ary part of Healthy Iowans 2010 . To assess people correctly , more awar e- ness is neede d of problem gambling and its signs and sy mptoms. In counseling, for exam ple, problem s at fi rst glance may appear to be marital or related to alcohol, anxiet y or depression, but April 2005 Chap ter 2 0 - Page 3 of 25 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Substance Abuse & Pr oblem Gambling excessive ga mbling may be the most significant contributi ng factor. Assessing pr oblem gam- bling can be difficult with out sufficient knowl- edge of the fi nancial and h ealth risks of a life filled with gam bling and its stress. Hidden prob lems include mental health problem s, violent and abusi ve actions, family abuse, inadequate scre ening, vehicle injuries and deaths, cri me, suicide, and low work productiv- ity. The preventio n and treatment of abuse of alcohol, other drugs, and problem gam bling re- quire that all abused substances, including to- bacco and ma rijuana, be discovered and ad- dressed. Prevention and tre atment of tobacco addiction, for exam ple, is equall y important to a comprehensive substance abuse program be- cause resear ch recognizes tobacco as a gateway to other dr ugs. Almost all long-term studies show a pattern of goi ng from tobacco and alcohol to m arijuana, and, as children get older, t o other dr ugs. How- ever, sm oking and dri nking at young ag es are not seen as the cause of lat er drug use, and going to other dr ug use is not ine vitable. In an anal ysis of 19 91-1993 data from the National Household Surve y on Dru g Abuse for people who h ave ever sm oked or dran k, \"...the risk of m oving on t o marijuana is 65 ti mes higher than f or a person who has never smoked or drank. The risk for m oving on to cocaine is 104 tim es higher for som eone who sm oked marijuana at l east once in his or her lifetime than a person who never did\" (P reventing Dru g Use among Childr en and Adole scents: A Research- Based Guide, National Institute on Drug Abuse). Although all goals and action steps for t o- bacco are list ed in the tobacco chapter, this chapter will include reco mmendations for alco- hol, tobacco and other drugs. Abuse does not occur in a vacuum . Pre ven- tion and treatment are nec essary in order to re- duce abuse of alcohol, tobacco, other drugs, and problem gambling. Efforts must be maintained and strengthened, especially in li ght of the emergence of metham pheta mine (meth). It is also neces sary to provide cultural, linguistic and age appropriate approaches. In m any situations (e.g., job training, em ployment, parent training, general education) elements of ph ysical health are nece ssary for successfu l living. Based on population, Iowa is the 30th state, yet ranks 6th in m eth use, according to prelimi- nary data from the 2001 Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) project. No other Midwest or eastern stat e ranks as high or higher. The question frequently asked is, \"Why Iowa? \" Meth traffickers discovere d that Iowa is a relatively new market wh ere they do not face a lot of com petition. I owa covers 55,8 75 square miles of Midwest landscape, with 56% of Io- wans living in urban areas and 44% in rural, non-m etropolitan areas. Of the 99 count ies, onl y 20 have U.S. Office of Managem ent and Budget designation a s Metropolitan Statistical Areas. The re maining 79 counties are pri marily agricul- tural. Iowa has three interstate highway s, multi- ple U.S. and state highways, and num erous count y roads. Its wide open spaces, accessibility to anhydrous amm onia (an agricultural fertilizer) for manufacture, and network of r oadway s for delivery m ay explain the hi gh rate of m eth use. The 200 2 Iowa Youth Sur vey indicated that amphetam ine and/or m etham phetam ine was the second m ost prom inent illicit drug of choice among adolescents. Of students in grades 6, 8, and 11 respo nding to the surve y, 1% reported current use of meth and 4% had used it at some point. Special pop ulations (students enrolled in alternative schools) reporte d that 52% were cur- rent users and as many as 82% had tried it. Data sub mitted by treatm ent program s to the Iowa Department of Publi c Health's Substance Abuse Reporting Sy stem (SARS) indicate that prior to 1994, metham phetam ine was listed as the prim ary substance of abuse less then 3% of the time. Since 1999, SA RS data shows a steady increase in the primary use of m eth, from 8.3% to 13.2%. Of those, 65% are men and 45% are wo men. In 2 002, 39% of peopl e in treatment pro grams who listed meth as their primary subst ance of abuse were under aged 25. Only alcohol and m arijuana are reported more frequentl y than meth. Exam ination of SARS data for client screen- ings and admissions also indicate that the second most prevale nt prim ary substance of abuse, ex- cluding alcoh ol, is am phetamine and/or Chap ter 2 0 - Page 4 of 25 April 2005 Substance Abuse & Pr oblem Gambling HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision metham phetamine. After a significant reduction in 19 99, the percentage of youth and ad ults screen ed or adm itted to substance abuse treat- ment programs with am phetam ine and/or metham phetamine as the prim ary drug of abuse increased in e ach of the p ast three y ears. That proporti on w as 15.8% in 2002; 17.3% in 2003; and 18. 7% in 2004 . The Des Moines site of the Arreste e Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) project saw an in- crease in the num ber of arrestees testing positive for meth, from 5.3% in the second quarter of 2000 , to 38.5% in the third quarter of 20 01. Ad- ditional fin dings include: Female arrestees ar e beginning to test posi- tive for m eth at a consisten tly higher rate than male s; Males of all a ges are using meth; Two y ears ago, m eth use b y women was greater am ong those aged 36 or older. I n 2002, the trend switched to include m ore wo men, m ore usage, and younger ages; Des Moines has had an increase in meth- related drug and pro perty charges am ong male arrestees, with propert y being used m ore often as an exchan ge for drugs. Unlike the male ar- restee s, wo men using m eth are arrest ed m ore frequentl y on drug charges than on property charges. Women co mbine meth, alcohol and driving at a hi gher rate then men; and An average of 72.8% of m ale and 74.5 % of female arrestees reported previous treatment, includin g inpatient and out patient substance abuse and me ntal health treat ment. The Iowa Division of Narcotics Enforce- ment documented a 37. 31% increase in the number of gram s of metham phetam ine seized between 1994 and 20 04. State and local law enforcem ent seized 1,155 meth labs in 2003 , and the num ber was expected t o increase in 2004. Throug h Sept ember 2004, 964 labs were seized. The am ounts of meth seized in Iowa dur ing 2003 increased to over 157,000 grams, or 352 poun ds, m ore than twice the previous record quantit y of 73,365 gram s seized in 200 1, and 39,863 in 2000. Statistics fro m the Iowa Departm ent of Pub- lic Safety and Corrections include: 90% of offen ders drug c ourt dicts. increase in the number of indicta ble misde meanor and felony drug charges were ad- judicated fro m 1998 to 20 00, with a 1 7% in- crease in convictions. An 81% increase in the num ber of reported drug offenses invol ving m eth manufacture or distributio n occurred between 1995 an d 2000 . New prison a dmissions for drug offenses increased by 164% betwee n 1995 and 2001; and admissions for meth-relat ed drug offenses grew by 416%. Since 2000, the Iowa Departm ent of Pub lic Health received fundi ng an d implemented pro- grams and ser vices to address Iowa' s metham- phetam ine problems. The grants includ Awaren ess (educatio n staff and public); TCE Meth Treat ment (jail- based treat ment) and TCE Prevention (expand prevention programs statewide); and Behavioral Health Dat a Infrastructure (WITS and I-SMART systems). Also, the State Treat ment Ne eds As- sessment Program (STNAP, househol d drug survey County ADAM, IDP H/CJJP data co mparisons) and the State Incentive Grant have expanded preventio n program s statewide. In addition, more behavioral research for sustained behavior change, and m ore program s for women and clients who also have mental problem s, is needed. To e nsure that m ultiple service needs are met, incr eased cooper ation and coordination are required from govern ment, faith communities, co mmunity-based services, organizations in the private and non-profit sec- tors, and comm unity members. In Februar y 2003, Governor Vilsack signed Executive Order 27, which urges Iowa to \"m ove purposefull y to swiftly implem ent the Ol mstead Decision.\" T his order say s that discrim ination can occur when people with disabilities cannot obtain needed services unle ss they live in an in- stitution or when a state' s disability services do not offer cons umers re al choices. The decision imposes a leg al mandate to initiate many of the concepts in Chapter 4: Disabilities. For those seeking recovery from substance abuse a nd/or problem gambling, ever y effort should be made to adm inister program s, ser vices and acti vities in April 2005 Chap ter 2 0 - Page 5 of 25 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Substance Abuse & Pr oblem Gambling the m ost integrated setting appropriate t o the needs of people with disabilities and long-term illnesses. Chapter 4, Disabilities, req uires a co mmit- ment, which Chapter 20 S ubstance Abuse and Problem Gambling su pport s, to pro vide pro- grams, servic es and activities in the m ost inte- grated setting appropriate t o the needs of people with disabiliti es and long-t erm illnesses, and to reduce barrier s to comm unity living for s uch persons. Such a commitment should as sure that: Local public health partners have the kn owl- edge and resources to provi de inform ation about federal, state and local resources that support community living f or persons with disabilities; Community services st aff receive adequ ate and appropria te training tha t focuses on how to meet the need s of persons with disabiliti es and improves staff sensitivity t o the needs of all Io- wans; Persons with disabilities have access to all public health facilities; Programs recognize and act on the fact t hat persons with disabilities are part of their cus- tomer base; Procedures and pro grams support and pro- mote co mmunity living for persons with dis- abilities; and Funding of c ommunity -based services pre- vents unnecessary institutionalization. To im plement the Olmste ad Decision in Iowa, institutional biases in policies and regula- tions m ust be identified an d overcom e. Barriers to real choice m ust be iden tified and m odified to improve services for people with disabilities who are affec ted by substa nce abuse an d/or problem gambling. In 2002, the Iowa legislature reduced the maxim um legal blood-alco hol concentration (BAC) level to .08% for drivers aged 21 and older. By then, increased a ccess to the state- approved Dri ving W hile Under the Influ ence program for I owans arrest ed for OWI was pro- vided b y the I owa Substance Abuse Program Directors Association, the I owa Department of Public Health, the Iowa Depart ment of Trans- portation, an d the Iowa Departm ent of Educa- tion. Licensed substance abuse treat ment agen-cies were able to conduct t he program independ- ently of comm unity colleges. The Iowa Departm ent of Public Health evaluated client lengths of stay in treatment and modified them based upon their im pact on o ut- comes. Evidence based, best practic e models were used (e. g., motivational interviewing) to improve outc omes. The Departm ent will con- tinue this pr ocess through 2010. Goal Statements & Action Steps 201 Goal Statement Establish a s ystematic process and be- gin to assess the infrastructure of the alcohol, tobacco and other drugs service system in I owa and its impact on quality prevention, earl y intervention, and treatment. Baseline: Data from program money sp ent and services provide d from the Iowa Substance Abuse Program Directors As- sociation, Su bstan ce Abu se Rep orting S ystem, and Iowa's Drug Co ntrol Strategy and Pl an. Rationale The alcohol, t obacco and ot her drugs pre - vention and treat ment agencies in Iowa a re in financial trouble. No significant increas e in fundin g in years has made it difficult for agen- cies to maintain infrastructure, recruit and retain qualified staff, and to im plement new res earch- based programming that meet s the nee ds of un- derserved and high risk clients. In 199 1, the Iowa Department of Publ ic Health's Division of Behav ioral Health and Pro- fessional Licensure provide d $13.6 m illion in state and federal funds to s ubsidize alcohol, to- bacco and other drugs treatment for low-income Iowans. With that m oney , 15,2 73 client s re- ceived subsidized service s, accounting for 58.6% of clients who received sim ilar treatment statewide dur ing that year. In 1998, $15.4 m illion becam e available from state an d federal sources to subsidize treatment for low-income Iowans for alcohol, tobacco and other drugs. O f the total available, $1.1 m illion, or 7%, was paid to a state con- Chap ter 2 0 - Page 6 of 25 April 2005 Substance Abuse & Pr oblem Gambling HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision tracted managed care co mpany to oversee the state tre atment program . This resulted in $14.3 million for cli ent treat ment, from which 24,396 clients received subsidized services, accounting for 63.6% of the total clients served stat ewide that y ear. In 199 1, the average fundin g per pu blic-pay client was $888. In 1998, the sam e average fundin g was $585 per client. Had the average funding per c lient been adjusted according to t he Consumer Price Index, $1,055 per client would have been provided i n 1998 just to m aintain the 1991 fund ing level. In 200 3, the Iowa Department of Publ ic Health's Division of Behav ioral Health and Pro- Licensure d $19.2 m illion for substance treatm ent fro m federal and state fund- ing to help lo w-inco me Iowans or those with no source of income or insurance. The num ber of clients receiving such treatment for alcohol, to- bacco and other drugs was 23, 335, with an av- erage funding of $8 23 per c lient.

The y currentl y take many courses on substance abuse . A consistent, cul- turally appropriate, resea rch-based course on alcohol, toba cco and other drugs (sup ported b y multiple resources within the community ) would increase the u se of a co mmon term inology and age-appropriate expectations. Drug and alcohol use of Io wa y outh in grades 6th through 12th has self-reportedly de- clined, according to the Iowa Youth Survey . Based on these trends, additional im provem ents can be anticipated. Analy sis of statewide data identif y gaps, provi de a com parison of results by districts, and indicate the scope of prevention. Substance use am ong Iowa children relates closely with f amily problems. Data fro m the Iowa Youth S urvey links many family-related risk indicator s to substance use am ong children. These include adults and other fa mily members with substance abuse probl ems, abuse and ne- glect, teen pregnancy , violence, and low socio- econom ic status.

Rationale Drinking and driving fatalities have contin- ued to declin e, from 29.9% in 1995 to 25.4% in 2000 . According t o the Io wa Department of Transportation, alcohol im pairs the driv er's abil- ity to brake, steer, change lanes, use one' s judg- ment, and adjust to road conditions.

As previously cited, the cooperating ag en- cies involved in the Iowa St ate Plan for Sub- stance Abuse Prevention (state plan) need a common language to deal with preventi on, in- tervention and treat ment in order to encourage low-risk alcohol quantit y and frequenc y choices consistent with the law. The alcohol b everage industry wants to r e- duce the risk for liabilit y lawsuits and protect its viabilit y (\"Does Server Intervention Trai ning Make a Difference?\" Alcohol Health and Re- search World, summer 1987; and \"Traini ng Bar Personnel to Prevent Drunken Driving: A Field Evaluation,\" American Journal of Public Health, August 19 87). The sale of alcohol and other drugs on t he Internet concerns so me health, law enforce ment, and federal drug enforceme nt agency officials, as well a s parents. Adults and youth need help to reduce ri sks. Participants in the 1997 I owa Substance Abuse Prevention H ousehold Survey reported they would like t o be better info rmed and receive in- formation thr ough the m edia. Prevention and treat ment professionals must be sensitive and responsive to the needs of the people the y serve.

Consequent ly, the pervasiveness of substance abuse among people aged 6 0 and ol der from many ethnic backgroun ds is onl y beginning to show itself. Alcohol and prescription misuse af fects 17% of older adults. However, health care provi ders overlook substance abuse and m isuse am ong older people, mistaking sym ptoms for dem entia, depression or other problems co mmon to older adults. Also, older adults are more likely to hi de their substance abuse and less likely to seek pro- fessional help. Many relative s of older peo ple with sub- stance abuse problem s are ashamed and choose not to recognize and addres s it. Lack of English fluency may also keep some fro m seeking help. The result is thousands of older adults who need services and do not receive the m. Many older Iowa residents are isolated and onl y hav e contact with the service providers co ming into t heir homes. Therefore, provid ers need to be trained to recognize this t ype of ab use and make appro- priate referral s. It is also i mportant for the community to understand th e problem s that older residents face. Such problems include loneliness, depres- sion, isolatio n, and substa nce abuse. Given the opport unity, many older residents want to be and can be produ ctive.

Rationale A general co nsensus of Iowa substance abuse treat ment professionals is that a tr eatment gap exists. A \"treatment gap\" is the difference between the num ber of people who need treat- ment because of illicit drugs and alcohol abuse and the capacity of the s ystem to provide that treatment. The num ber of people receiving treatment y early in Iowa is reported to the Sub- stance Abuse Reporting Syste m of the Iowa De- partm ent of Public Health, Division of S ub- stance Abuse. However, the num ber of persons who need dru g and alcohol treatm ent can onl y be estim ated throug h household sur veys and re- views of clie nt waiting lists for services and trends in treatment lengths of stay . Given the financial, infrast ructure and staff- ing problem s of treat ment agencies, it is difficult for them to expand services in order to reduce the treatm ent gap and im plem ent appropriate research-based m odels for treat ment of m ulti- l outcom es are fur- by the lack of support ive rehabili- tative service s, including em ng envir onments. A num ber of activities are needed, such as: annual tracking of demographics b y ethnicity, race, gender, primary language, and success rates; a sy stematic develo pmental plan to m eet the needs of Iowa's diverse pop ulation; program assist ance to beco me culturally com petent and acquire training and consultation to successfully recruit, hire and retain professionals fro m di- verse populations; and pr ogram assistan ce to provide their professionals and staff with ongo- ing trainin g on working with people of racial and ethnic cultures. 205.1 Action Step Throug h 2010, maintain and im plement a statewide pla n for substance abuse tre atment to assure that all Iowa populat ions have access to appropriate research-ba sed treat ment.

(An Iowa Department of Public Health action step. ) 206 Goal Statement Enact legislation requiring insurers to provide coverage for mental illness and addiction as is done for an y other chronic illness. Baseli ne: See Rationale. Rationale A recent nati onal study reveals that public expenditures nationall y for mental health ser- vices and substance abuse t reatment over a 10- year period (1991- 2001) totaled $67.4 billion in 2001 , while p rivate spending came to onl y $36.6 billion. The percentage of public fundi ng con- tinues to increase, with a smaller per centage provided by private sources (includin g private health insurance). Substance abuse tre atment costs paid by private insurance fell by an aver- age rate of 1.1% annuall y over the 10- year pe- riod, declinin g from 24% in 19 91 to 13% ex- penditures in 2001 . In FY2003 , 55% of the cost for substance abuse treat ment in Iowa was fro m public sources, while 28% was fr om self-pay ; 15% from private insurance; and 3% from other sources. In FY 2004, the cost of treat ment bor ne by public funding and self-pay increased to 56% and 31% respectively . However, private insur- ance 13% and other sources decre ased to 2%. The federally legislated Mental Health Par- ity Act of 19 96 requires insurers to provi de the same annual and lifetime spending limits for mental health as for other health care ben efits. However, it is up to states to address coverage minim ums. Mental health and substance abuse parity laws vary greatl y among the states. A recent Substance Abuse and Mental Health Servic es Ad ministra tion (SAMHSA) re- port suggested the cost of parity could be mini- mal. The impact on prem iums can be controlled by limiting the scope of the parit y law to bio- logical-based illnesses, li miting the number of providers cov ered by the law, and using aggres- sive managed care practi ces. Most studies that suggest low costs (e.g., less than 1%) as sume aggressive managed care, according to an Iowa Insurance Division and I owa Department of Public Health briefing pape r. Eventuall y, other April 2005 Chap ter 2 0 - Page 13 of 2 5 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Substance Abuse & Pr oblem Gambling inform ation will be available from the Gover- nor's Enterprise Plan on Health. Acce ss to nee ded substance abuse and men- tal health trea tment has bee n a concern for some time and parity would increase a ccess to treat- ment statewide if those 23, 000 plus Iow ans who access needed treat ment annuall y had health in- surance cover age. 206.1 Action Step By 2010, promote the HAWK-I expansion of mental health and substa nce abuse treatm ent to achieve parity.

(An Iowa Departm ent of Publ ic Health and Iowa Depart ment of Hum an Services action step.) 206.3 Action Step Throug h 2010, monitor parity legislatio n in other states a nd its im pact on costs. (An Iowa Department of Public Health, Iowa Departm ent of Human Services, and Iowa Insurance Divi- sion action step.) 207 Goal Statement Assure that the proportion of Io wans ex- periencing problems with gambling does not increase above the Behavioral Risk Factor Surv eillance Surve of respon - dents who h ad gamble d in the past 12 m onths said the mo ney they spent gambling le d to fi- nancial probl ems; 1.7% re ported the tim e spent gamblin g led to proble ms in family, work or per- sonal life. Rationale Iowa legal gam bling includes use of slot machines; c asino table games such as bla ckjack, ticket s and pull tabs; lottery ; stocks; and commodities. Iowa also re gulates bingo, raffles and pools; games of skill and chance; social gambling; contests, casino nights and comme r- cial otions. Iowa has thre e racetr acks a nd 10 casinos, with the strong likelihood t hat more facil ities will open well before 2010. Three Native American ca sinos also are located in Iowa. Ille- gal sports wagering and I nternet Access to Inte rnet gam bling by young and old alike adds a new dimension to g ambling and prob lem gambling. The Iowa Gam bling Treatment Program (IGTP) in the Iowa Department of Publi c Health provides services for people affect ed directly or indirectly b y problem gambling. Its m ission is to prom ote and protect the health of Iow ans by reducing the effects of problem gam bling through educ ation, awareness and treat ment. The IGTP program is funded throu gh th e gambling treatm ent fund th at, effective Jul y 1, 2004, received 0.5% of t he gross lotter y revenue and 0.5% of the adjusted gross receipts f rom the riverboat casi nos and the ra cetracks, an i ncreas e from 0.3% in previous years. The Iowa Lottery portion is estimated at $1 million and t he gam- ing industr y portion at $5 million. Up t o $6 m il- lion is appropriated to the depart ment. As in past y ears, mone y from this fund has be en di- verted for other purposes. Just under $1.7 m il- lion was diverted from addictive disorders pro- gram s in 200 5. The availability of about $4.3 m illion is ex- pected for gam bling treatment, prevention, awar eness of problem gambling, and services for more Iowans. The existing outpatient str ucture has proven to be an effecti ve safety net and needs to continue as the basic approach for counseling families and ga mblers aff ected by excessive gam bling. Additional funding will be used to increase treat ment a nd crisis services a s more gamblers and family members seek help. Little federal money has been devoted to problem gambling. However, recent succes s was a chieved when the Midwest Confer ence on Problem Gambling and Substance Abuse was held in August 2004. Four states (Iowa, Kansas, Chap ter 2 0 - Page 14 of 2 5 April 2005 Substance Abuse & Pr oblem Gambling HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Missouri, and Nebraska) ap plied for and re- ceived a $50, 000 federal g rant from the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment under th e Sub- stance Abuse and Mental Health Services Ad- ministration, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission, its licensees, and the Iowa Lottery coope rate with the Iowa Gam bling Treat ment Program to address problem gam bling. An annual R espon- sible Gam ing Education W eek is sponsored b y the gam ing industr y. The industr y also s upports National Prob lem Gambling Awareness Week in March, which has been sponsored in part by the Association of Problem Gam bling Service Ad- ministrators. The Iowa Lottery develo ped Iowa-specific public service announcem ents when bud gets were tight. The gam ing industr y prom otes the 1- 800-BETS O FF helpline i n its advertisements and signs. It also provides links to t he www.1800betsoff.org web site. Effective July 1, 2004, state law required a process to a llow a person to be voluntaril y excluded for lif e from all state licen sed casinos. Also, any money or thing of value that has been obtained b y, or is owed to, a vo luntaril y excl uded person by a li- censee as a re sult of wagers made by the person after the he or she has been voluntarily excluded shall not be p aid to the per son but shall be de- posited into the gam bling treatment fund . bling Treatment Program and its 1-800-BE TS OFF Helpline are excellent re- sources for Iowans to find help with proble m gambling. T he helpline li nks callers to treat- ment and education from providers thro ugho ut the state 24 hours a da y. Of those who seek help through the Iow a Gam bling Treatment Prog ram, about 80 0 gam - blers annually receive counseling for their prob- lem. Assessment, screening and co unseling hours for gamblers and c oncerned persons total almost 16,000 annuall y. In addition, about 1,000 crisis counseling hours are provid ed annu- ally to others faced with desperate situati ons. Some are ad mitted for treat ment. Gamblers' activities affect their fa milies, friends, em ployers, and ot hers - and the se per- sons m ust also be considered. The Iowa Ga m-bling Treatment Program annuall y provides counseling to over 10 0 con cerned persons on how to handle the consequences of proble m gambling. E ven if other I owans consult with clergy , fam ily counselors, and social workers, only a fractio n gets help.

Television spot s about excessive gambling declined m arkedl y and resulted in a dram atic decr ease in 1-800-BETS OFF helpline calls. \"Media Expendi- tures, Calls a nd Clients,\" portray s how much advertising, especially television, increa ses c alls to the helpli ne. Over 4,000 calls were h andled in 19 98 com pared to fewer than 1,4 00 in FY2004. A 1998 evalu ation of the a dvertising pr o- gram for the 1-800-BETS OFF helpline showed overwhelm ing supp ort for the messages. 97% of Iowans agreed that a clear message was provided. 93% agreed mes sages were a valuable re- source. April 2005 Chap ter 2 0 - Page 15 of 2 5 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Substance Abuse & Pr oblem Gambling The Depart ment contracte d with the Harvard Medical School to review 1 998-2 001 participant data. \"The Iowa Department of Pu blic Health Gambling Treat ment Services: Four Yea rs of Evidence\" (2002) reported that am ong gam blers who com pleted the progra m and for whom re- cords were av ailable, 74% were abst aining from gambling six months later.

The effective statewide pur chase of multi- media mess ages, especiall y on television, in- creases calls t o the 1-800-B ETS OFF helpline. An advertising agency coordinates the creation and placem ent of m essages for television, bill- boards, print , and radio. Client num bers would likely increase to above 900 if m ore television messages aired to stim ulate calls and connec- tions to treatment provide rs.

No oth er gam e acco unted for m ore than a small fra ction of losses. The Harvard Medical School Division on Addictions co ntracted to perform more client follow-up ana lysis to prov ide an outside, objec- tive review of what works best in preventing and treating probl em gam bling. As mentioned ear- lier, crises annuall y account for hundreds more service hours to m any Iowans. \"The Iowa De- partm ent of Public Health Gam bling Treatment Services: Four Years of Evidence\" data shows a relationship b etween cris is contacts relat ed to problem gambling an d exp osure to a casino. Crisis contacts are via telep hone calls or office visits b y persons in need of urgent help who are not adm itted as a client. Areas of high er crisis contacts related to problem gambling ten d to cluster around gam - bling venues. For exam ple, the northern region of Iowa, which is devoid of gam bling establish- ments, had the lowest concentration of c risis contacts. Counties with the highest concentra- tions of crisis contacts (Woodbur y, Dub uque, Polk, and Ringgold) are located within 5 0 miles of at least one gam bling est ablish ment, a nd m ost are in areas of exposure to multiple venues. Counties within a 50-m ile radius of a casino had a statistically significant hi gher rate of p opula- tion-adjusted crisis contact s than countie s out- side that radius. When additional gam bling facilities open, preparations m ust be in place for more client services. Ad ditional funding m ust first go to- ward providing direct client services prior to launching any new initiati ve. Preventing un- healthy gam bling sho uld be a top priorit y be- cause it is ke y to avoiding future costs. Prom ot- ing health y gambling shou ld be a m ajor focus, along with pr oviding accurate informati on about the nature of gambling for those choosin g to gamble. In addition to outpatient counseling (indi - vidual, gr oup and fam ily), providers off er educa- tion o n problem gam bling and preventio n to at- risk groups (s enior, un derage, cultural) at no charge. Sessi ons have been held for banking, finance, insurance, school, hum an service, and health care organizations. Mental health, chem ical dependency , medical fields, and the criminal justice sy stem benefit as well. See a following tab le for a listing of annual ed ucation hours. Priorities are to reduce health disparities by people with disabilities, minorities, m igrants, immigrants, r efugees, and their fam ilies. They also include providing infra structure that focuses on preventi on and awareness of problem gam- bling withi n these populati ons, as well as appro- priate and effective educati on and outreach.

A statewide multi-media effort m ust continue with f unding at or above the current level, and include outreach by treatment providers and local educational presentations. Presentations focus on such topics as: Screening for problem gamblers by coun sel- ors, clergy , health care providers, and fi nancial and credit entities can better identif y people who hide their pro blem gam bling behin d alcohol and other drug use. For exam ple, a good scr eening question is, \" Have y ou ever borrowed mone y or borrowed on a credit card to gam ble or pay off gambling deb ts?\" The Lie-Bet Screening Instrument has been deem ed valid and reliable for rulin g out patho- logical gam bling. Questio ns include 1) Have you ever felt t he need to bet more and m ore money ? and 2) Have you ever had to li e to peo- ple im portant to you abo ut how m uch you gam - bled? A \"Yes\" to either ite m indicates a need for further assess ment. (Jo hnson, E.E., Hamer, R., Nora, R.M., Tan, B., Eistenstein, N., & Englehart, C. 1988 . patholog logical Reports, 80, 8 3-88.) Suicides and suicide attempts are often re- lated to probl em gam bling. Som e motor vehicle injuries and deaths may result from people fac- ing insurm ountable gam bling debts. Dri ving while in a drowsy state due to long hours of gambling m ay also cause a ccidents. Violent and abusive actions may result from losses, debts and tim e spent gam bling. Family probl ems also often result from gambling. Fa milies need a nswers to questions, such as \"What steps should be taken when someone close has a gam bling pr oblem ? How does one inte rvene? How does a person get help?\" Crim es to sup port pro blem gambling incl ude embezzlemen t, theft and fr aud. The Iow a Divi- sion of Crim inal Investigation m ust continue its deterrence of illegal gam bling, including illegal sports betting, illegal slot machines, an d other criminal activ ities. Inform ation provided t o the judicial and cor- rectional sy stem needs to be more focus ed on problem gambling, which can be well hidden. Gamblers sometimes use secret post office boxes for bill s or forge sig natures on second mortgage s and loans. Employers ex perience lower producti vity from workers pr oblem gam bling sho uld be provided at the workplace bec ause it alerts key people to this behavior and to the tim e and m oney spent by those with a gam bling p roblem . Prevention de signed to g ive students an al- ternative to d rinking shoul d be careful about using \"casino nights.\" Since a portion of the populati on is susceptible to developing problem gambling, the re should be a lternative activities other than ga mbling to int erest y oung people. Caution should be ta ken in substituting one problem behavior for an other. Young people must also be inform ed about problem gam bling and the negat ive results on educational and ca- reer opportunities, as well as relationships. Also, co mmunity education needs to cover problem gambling an d its effect on the co mmu- nity by helping answer questions such as: What are the criteria for responsible ga m- bling ? Is it a percentage of take-home pay? What are the lim its of social ga mbling? How does on e know if one 's gam bling i s okay? Chap ter 2 0 - Page 18 of 2 5 April 2005 Substance Abuse & Pr oblem Gambling HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Regarding seniors and ga mbling, how m uch gambling is o kay? Do seni ors know wh ere to get help? How can people be assure d the y're not gambling too much? Are there factors th at pre- dispose some one to gam ble exces sively? Are youn g peop le more at-risk than adults or senior citizens? Is ga mbling on credit oka y? Eas y acces s to money , particularly, at casinos, can trigger an impulse to gam ble to win back previous losses. One for m of mea suring succes s is by benefi- cial changes i n health or re ductions in risk fac- tors; another is to asses s improvem ent in provid- ing services. Progress reviews should odically adoles- cents and racial and/or ethn ic groups. It is im- portant to rec ognize and address emerging issues such as changing dem ographics, advances in preventive th erapies, and new technologies. Establishing state health goals and m onitor- ing progress on problem gambling could m oti- vate action to im prove Io wans' health in this area a s well a s in other affected area s. There are so many unanswer ed questions in the field of problem gambling t hat an evaluation team or other entit y should be established. There is a co ntinuing need to: Determine if the whole po pulation is being reached. The reality is that the message will not matter for so me who will continue have a gam - bling proble m. Determine if m ore outreach and/or l ocal messages are necess ary to get m ore peo ple into program s and other services.

Chap ter 2 0 - Page 20 of 2 5 April 2005 Substance Abuse & Pr oblem Gambling HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Substance abuse prevention specialists a nd community leaders continue to collaborate to form or maintain SAFE community coal itions. There were 1 06 active SAFE community coali- tions in 2005. Man y of them mentor nearb y communities in the process of organizing and mobilizing to broaden subs tance abuse preven- tion efforts statewide. In Novem ber 2004, Governor Vilsack de- clared Iowa a State of Promise and a member of the Am erican 's Prom ise Program founded after the Presidents' Summ it for A merica's future, April 27-29 , 1997 . At that conference, the president challenged the na tion to make youth a national prior ity. The call t o action included a commitment by the nation to fulfill Fi ve Prom - ises. A merica's Prom ise created a diverse and growing allia nce of m ore than 400 national or- ganizations called Partners that make lar ge-scale national commit ments to fulfill one or more of the Five Promises. These groups span all sectors of society and include higher education, corpora- tions, non-pr ofits, faith-based groups, a ssocia- tions, federal agencies, and arts and cultural or- ganizations. The SAFE community coal itions will be working with the A merica's Prom ises. Sub- stance abuse prevention m ay be integrated within each of the Five Promise s of 1) Caring Adults, 2) Sa fe Place s, 3) Healthy Start, 4) Mar- ketable Skills, and 5) Opportunities to Se rve. Over tim e, the intention an d goal is for i ndivid- ual SAFE community coal itions to blend with larger \"co mmunity of prom ise\" coalitions. 208.1 Action Step By 2006, establish a sub-gr oup (con tinue the State Incentive Grant Advisory Subcom mittee) of the Office Of Drug Cont rol Polic y's Drug Pol- icy co ordinate polic y de- velopm ent, planning and resources for increas - ing and sustaining alcohol, tobacco and other drugs coalitions.

The Centers for Diseas e Control and Prevention (CDC) rec- ommends the following goals for a co mprehen- sive tobacco control progra m: Prevent the initiation of tobacco use am ong youn g peop le; Prom ote cessation am ong youn g peop and adults; Elim inate exposure and Identif y and e liminate disparities relat ed to tobacco. There have been a num ber of changes and developm ents in tobacco control since the first edition of Healthy Iowans 2010 was rele ased. The majority of the goal state ments and action steps fro m the original version have either been modified or elim inated. Additionall y, the chap- ter now inclu des new goals and action steps to reflect the many changes in the tobacco control landscape in Iowa. The order of the goals has been changed to reflect the priorities and most effective toba cco control practice s. Res earch and recent experience of state tobacco c ontrol program s demonstr ate tha t there are cru cial components of tobacco use prevention and con- trol m easure s: Increase the tax on tobacco products; Reduce exposure to secondhand sm oke by changing soci al norm s and environm ents that support t obacco use; Prom ote ote and ssation of tobacco among y outh; and Restrict minors' access to t obacco. Each of these com ponents must be continu- ally monitored and evaluat ed to determ ine if desired outcomes are being achieved to i mprove the overall effectiveness of implemented strate- gies. No single factor deter mines pattern s of tobacco use. Instead, th ey are the result of com - plex interactions of factors such as socioeco- nomic status, cultural chara cteristic s, individual physiological and genetic characte ristics, the im pact of targeted advertis- ing, the price of tobacco pr oducts and the extent of restriction on their use, and the vary ing capac- ity of comm unities to m ount effective tobacco control initiat ives. To achieve the individ ual behavioral change that supports the non- use of tobacco requires whole communities to change the way tobacco is prom oted, sold and used w hile also changing the knowledge, a ttitudes and practices of young people, tobac co-users and non-users. Ef fective community programs invol ve people in t heir homes, work sites, schools, places of worship and entertainment, and other public places, and in civic organ izations. Community -based rese arch has shown that comprehensi ve program s are effe ctive in reduc- ing tobacco buil ding c apacity to implem ent and support tobacco use prevention and cess ation include a focus on change in social norms and environ- ments that support t obacco use, polic strategies, co mmunity obilization, de- velopm ent of local tobacco control progra ms, and coordinat ion of statewide and local activi- ties. They also include li nkage of school -based activities to community activities; use of surveil- lance and evaluation techni ques to m onitor pro- April 2005 Chap ter 2 1 - Page 1 of 20 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Tobacco Use gram impact; and strategic use of the me dia to build public s upport for tobacco control pro- grams and policies, reinforce social norms sup- porting the non-use of tobacco, and counteract the pro-use message s and images of tobacco marketing and pu blic relations cam paigns. Tobacco use appears to be susceptible to changes in the social environm ent. Federal, state and local governm ent agencies and num er- ous health or ganizations have joined to develop and im plement prevention activities to reduce tobacco use in the Unite d States. They focus primarily on populati on-ba sed strategies that emphasize prevention of i nitiation and re duction of exposure t o environm ental tobacco sm oke. A few definitions for easier understandi ng follow. As used in this chapter (unless other- wise noted), tobacco and tobacco produc ts mean cigarettes, cig ars, little cigars, cheroots, stogies, periques, granulated, plug cut, cri mp cut, ready rubbed, and other sm oking tobacco; snuff and snuff flour; c twist tobacco; fine-cut and other chewing tobaccos; shorts, re- fuse scraps, c lippings, cuttings, and sweepings of tobacco; other kinds and forms of tobacco prepared to be suitable for chewing or sm oking in a pipe or otherwise; and other kin ds and form s of tobacco for either chewi ng and sm oking. Tobacco use means employing any of these tobacco products in such a manner that nicotine and other che micals are ab sorbed into the user' s body. (referred to as Environm ental Tobacco Sm oke or ETS in the first version of this chapter) is a co mbination of smoke exhaled b y the smoker and side-stream smoke (that which is em itted from a bu rning tobacco product). Inhaling this is known as in- voluntary or passive s moking. Cigarette sm oking is t he leading preventable cause of dise ase and death in the United States. Tobacco control is designated as one of the top ten public he alth measure s in the United States. Scientific kno wledge about the health co nse- quences of tobacco use has increased gre atly since the rele ase of the firs t Surgeon Ge neral' s Report on Tobacco in 1964. It is now well docum ented t hat smoking cigarettes causes heart disease, perip heral vascular disease, chro nic lung disease, and cancers o f the lung and lary nx. Tobacco is the most addict ing ps ychoactive drug and the effects of nic otine, the addictive agent in toba cco, are very similar to those of cocaine and am phetamines. The user experi- ences a \"high,\" a sense of releas e from stress or sense of euphoria. More th an three tim es as many people are addicted to cigarettes a s are addicted to alcohol. Consequences of s moking during pregna ncy may include s pontaneous a bortions, l ow birth weight babies, and sudden infant death syn- drom e (SI DS). Cigar use causes c ancer of the larynx, mouth, esophagus, and lun g. Use of smokeles s tobacco cause s a num ber of s erious oral health pr oblems including periodontitis, tooth l oss, and cancer of the mouth. Exposure to s econdhand s moke is detrimen- tal to health and can result in disease, disability and death. Si gnificant exp osure to secondhand smoke occurs both i n the home and at work. At least 43 of the more than 4,000 chem ical com - pounds that have been identified in tobacco smoke caus e cancer in humans and animals. The Burden of Tobacco-Related Disease in Iow a Every year over 4,600 deaths in Iowa are attributable to tobacco-relat ed diseases and $794 million in m edical expendi tures are attri butable to cigarette sm oking. of Iowa Medi- caid program incurs approxi mately $235 million of these s moking-related medical expenditures.) If current trends continue, 80,000 Iowa youth alive toda y will eventuall y die from smo king. Since 1998, the prevalence of sm oking among those aged 18 and older in Iowa h as re- mained relati vely stable , with 21. 7% of adults survey ed in the 2003 Behavioral Risk F actor Chap ter 2 1 - Page 2 of 20 April 2005 Tobacco Use HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Surveillance Sy stem being current sm okers. 'Current' was defined as sm oking either some days or every day duri ng the past 30 da ys and smoking at least 100 cigarettes in a lifetime.

Cigarette s moking is a m ajor cause of dis- ease and death am ong Afri can-Americans, Na- tive A merican Indians and Alaska Nativ es, Asian A mericans and Pacific Islanders, a nd His- panics, accor ding to the 1998 Report of the Sur- geon General, Tobacco Use Am ong U.S. Ra- cial/Ethnic Minorit y Groups. The report con- cluded that African-A mericans currentl y bear the greatest health burden among those groups studied. Among adu lts, Native Am erican Indi- ans and Alas ka Natives ha ve the highest preva- lence of tobacco use. Afri can-A meric an and Southeast Asian men also have a high preva- lence of sm oking. Further more, sm oking am ong African-A merican y outh increas ed substantially during the 1990s following a dram atic d ecline during the 19 70s and 1 980s. Political instabilit y around the world and an extraordinarily high dem and for entr y-level la- borers (especi ally within agricultural product processing industries) has resulted in a substan- tial imm igration of people f rom diverse cultures into Iowa during recent years. Accordi ng to the 2000 Iowa census, 98. 9% of the state's 2.9 m il- lion residents were Cau casian (white), 3 were African-Am In- dian, and 36,635 were Asian. In Iowa, smoking prevalence am ong ethnic minorities is at much higher rates in com parison to Caucasian s. These numbers underscore the need for targeted to- bacco control program s aimed at these popula- tion gr oups. April 2005 Chap ter 2 1 - Page 3 of 20 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Tobacco Use Nationwide, persons with disabilities aged 18 and older have a 33% smoking prevalence rate, co mpared to 2 3% for persons without dis- abilities ( Healthy People 2 010). In Iowa, how- ever, the s moking prevalence rate of per sons aged 18 and over with disabilities is much lower than the nationwide rate (22.9%), and com para- ble to the pre valence rate o f persons without dis- abilities (21.5%), according to the 2003 BRFSS. Surve y estimates of curren t use of chewing tobacco and snuff are some what varied and do not suggest any large changes over time . Ap- proxim ately 16 to 20% of adults report e ver us- ing sm okeles s tobacco pr oducts and 3% to 5% report their current use (Iowa Tobacco Control Program Evaluation, 2 003). In 20 02, cur rent (within the pa st 30 da ys) use of sm okeless to- bacco was r eported high school students (an estim ated 13,184 students). This is less than half (33%) of the high school students who reported ever using smokeless tobac co (Iowa Youth Tobacco Survey ). Approxim ately 50 0 Iowans die every year as a result of exposure to secondhand sm oke. An estimated 231 ,000 chil dren in Iowa are exposed to secondhan d smoke at home. Attem pts by two Iowa co mmunities to introduce s moke-f ree res- taurant ordina nces wer e nullified in Ma y 2003 when the Iowa Supreme C ourt ruled aga inst the city of Ames' smoke-free r estaurant ordinance that was passed in March 2 001. This de cision countered a formal opinio n from the Iowa Attor- ney General i n Novem ber 2000 and o verturned a district court ruling suppor ting the abilit y of Iowa co mmunities to restrict s moking in public places more stringently than the state code. This decision also nullified anot her sm oke-free ordi- nance in the city of Iowa Ci ty. Tobacco Control Initiatives in Iow a Tobacco control initiatives in Iowa have greatly increa sed in the past since the original version of Healthy Iowans 2010 was pub lished. In 199 8, Iowa and 45 other states agreed to a mast er settlement agreement (MSA) with the tobacco indus try worth over $206 billi on to set- tle the states' attorney s general law suits against the tobacco com panies and their resear ch asso-ciations. The suit filed by Iowa alleged that the defendants violated Iowa's Consum er Fraud Act by \"repeatedly and s ystematically misleading the public\" abo ut the health da ngers of sm oking an d by failing to disclose the addictive quali ties of nicotine. In 2000, the Iowa legislature allocated $9.3 million of the master settlement agreement for a statewide, co mprehensive tobacco control pro- gram . However, this was still significantly less than the Centers for Dise ase Control and Preven- tion (CDC) reco mmended fundin levels for Iowa (between $19.3 and $48.7 m illion). The following is a progress summary of Iowa' s to- bacco control efforts since 2000: In 200 0, established the Io wa Co mmission on Tobacco Use Preventi on and Control, as well as the Division of Tobacco Use Preventi on and Control. Since FY200 1, made funding available to all 99 counties, to create local \"community partner- ships\" that address tobacco prevention a nd con- trol issues at the local level. In 2000, established Just Elim inate Lies (JEL), a y outh-led m ovement with a m ission to expose the lies of the tobacco industr y and m ake tobacco use socially unaccep table in our society . In 2001, established Quitli ne Iowa, a state- wide sm oking cessation hotline. Since FY2001, the legislature allocated funding for s moking cessation pr ogram s in free medical clini cs. In FY2005, three free medical clinics in Iowa received fu nding to provide ces- sation counseling and nicot ine replacement ther- apy to low-in come and underinsured in dividuals. In 2003, 89% of Iowa' s tobacco retail ers were found com pliant during com pliance checks, co mpared to 67% in 1999. Currently, the Iowa Department of Publi c Health facilit ates the Iowa Youth To- bacco Surveys in ev en-num bered y ears. According to the 200 2 Iow a Youth Toba cco Surve y, 34% of all high school stu dents and 11% of all m iddle school st udents report ed hav- ing used tobacco products within the pa st 30 days. This represented a 13% reduction in usage of tobacco pr oducts am ong high school s tudents Chap ter 2 1 - Page 4 of 20 April 2005 Tobacco Use HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision and a 31% reduction am ong m iddle sch ool stu- dents from 2000 to 2002. After only two years from the initiation of the program , the state legislature reduced fund- ing for the Division of Tobacco Us e Pre vention and Control to $5.1 million. As a result, fundi ng for program s that provided smoking cess ation counseling to pregnant wo men and their fam ily mem bers, as well as school-based tobacco pre- vention progr ams, were eliminated. Allocation of a portio n of the disbursements provid ed for in this historic agreem ent is essential to produce substantial reductions in tobacco use. In Iowa, there are four statewide coalitions dedicated to tobacco prevention and control. 1. Tobacco Free Iowa (TFI) is a statewide coa- lition of state organizations, local groups, and indivi duals working togeth er to coordina te ef- forts to control and prevent tobacco use in Iowa. 2. Iowa's Healt h Initiative (I HI) is a coalit ion comprised of over 50 organ izations advo cating for an increas e in the state tax on tobacco prod- ucts. 3. Clean Air For Everyone Io wa (CAF\u00c9 Io wa) is a grassroots coalition that supports restoring local tobacco control to Iowa co mmunities. 4. The Iowa Consortium for Co mprehensive Cancer Contr ol's Tobacco Control Im plementa- tion workgroup is a statewide coalition t hat ac- tively support s the previous three coalitions, as well as the planning an d implementation of addi- tional unique tobacco control activities (see chapter two for additional inform ation). Goal Statements & Action Steps 211 Goal Statement Increase the tax on cigarettes b y $1.00 per pack. Baseli ne: The curre nt tax on ciga- rettes in Iowa (as of FY 2004) is 36 c ents. Rationale The tobacco tax in Iowa was last rai sed in 1991 by one cent. Iowa ranks 42nd of all states in their tax status. The average tax of all states is 79.2 cents per pack. Raising the tax o n to-bacco produc ts is one of the most effecti ve way s to reduce smoking among both youth and adults. Rese arch shows that a pric e increas e of $1.00 per pack of cigarettes can be expected to pro- duce a 19.5% decrease in consum ption b y youth. A substantial part of the de cline is a resu lt of children who will not initia te sm oking at higher prices. Approxim ately 26,000 current a dult smokers in Iowa would qui t as a result of a $1.00 tax incr ease, and 5,700 people would be saved fro m a smoking-caused death. Tobacco taxation is also an efficient means to offset the enorm ous cost s caused by tobacco. An Iowa tobacco tax will reduce the num ber of residents who sm oke and reduce the substantial cost of sm oking to I owa's state economy and annual bu dget. According to the Cam paign for Tobacco Free Kids, a $1.00 tax increase would raise more than $163 m illion in new revenues each y ear. The 5-y ear health care savings from fewer s moking-caused hear t attacks and strokes alone would t otal $10. 3 million. 211.1 Action Step By 2005, dev elop and im plem ent a legisla- tive strategy that includes regular co mmunica- tion with elected officials a nd educates the m on all aspects of the tax issue. (An Iowa' s Health Initiative action step.) 211.2 Action Step By 2005, dev elop and im plem ent a state- wide public awarene ss and education cam paign to buil d a base for grassroots support.

(An Iowa' s Health Initiative, Tobacco Free Io wa, and Iowa De- partm ent of Public Health action step.) 212 Goal Statement Pass local control legislation that will allow com munities the option to regulate smoking in public places to protect citi- zens from the dangers of secondhand smoke. Baseline: Accordi ng to a 2003 I owa Suprem e Co urt rulin g, local governi ng bodie s do not have the authority to re gulate sm oking in publi c places, pursuant to Iowa Code Section 142B. The ci ties of Ames and Iowa City passed local o rdinances in 200 1 and 200 2 respectively. Iowa City rep ealed thei r ordinan ce after the court's ruling and Ame s has retain ed the irs on the city books. Rationale Diseases caused by exposure to secondhand smoke take the lives of 53,000 Am ericans each year, 5 00 of whom are Iowans. Secondhand smoke is the third leading c ause of preventable death in the U.S and cont ains more than 50 known cancer-causing carcinogens. According to the 2002 Iowa Adult Tobacco Survey con- ducted b y the Gallup Organization, 84% of Io-wans agreed that people sh ould be prote cted from secondhand sm oke. 212.1 Action Step By 2005, dev elop and im plem ent a legisla- tive strategy to pass legisla tion that restores a community' s abilit y to pass clean indoor air or- dinances. (A Clean Air For Everyone Iowa ac- tion step.) 212.2 Action Step By 2005, dev elop and im plem ent a state- wide public awarene ss and education cam paign that reaches e very county in Iowa. (A Clean Air For Ever yone Iowa and community partnership action step.) 212.3 Action Step Throug h 2010, provide ed ucational materi- als and technical as sistanc e to comm unities so they can im plement a plan to pass local ordi- nances. (A Clean Air For Everyone Iowa action step.) 212.4 Action Step Through 2010, increase the num ber of communities who are actively working on pass- ing local clean indoor air ordinances and other smoke-free policies. (A Clean Air For Everyone Iowa, co mmunity partnersh ips, and Iowa De- partm ent of Public Health action step.) 212.5 Action Step Through 2010, buil d and s ustain a coalition that can work together to pass the legisla tion. (A Clean Air For Every one Iowa action step.) 213 Goal Statement Enact legislation that requires the Io wa Division of Tobacco Use Prevention and Control to be consistent with the Best Practices for Compre hensive Tobacco Control pro grams as outlined b y the Centers for Disease Control and Preven- tion (CDC). Baseli ne: Th e Divisio n cco Use Preventi on and Control curre ntly receive s a $5 million appropriation by the Iowa legi slature from the He althy Iowan's T obacco Tru st. The Chap ter 2 1 - Page 6 of 20 April 2005 Tobacco Use HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision program p rovides mini mal fundin g for co mmu- nity grams are se verely unde r-funde d and far from meeting CDC's minimum guide- lines. Rationale The CDC's annual fu nding reco mmenda- tions for Iow a are $19.35 t o $48.71 million in order to have an effective, comprehensive to- bacco prevention program . When the Division was e stablished in FY2000, the legislature ap- propriated $9.3 m illion, then reduced it to $5 million in FY 2003. Iowa's current progr am is not com prehensive in natur e and does no t pro- vide fun ding for school pr ograms or chronic dis- ease progra ms. The CDC reco mmends that states e stablis h tobacco control programs that are co mprehensive, sustainable and accountable. To achieve this, the state must allocate fundin g within CDC's reco mmend ed guidelines. 213.1 Action Step Throug h 2010, develop and im plement a public aware ness and education ca mpaign to recruit and educate advocat es and the general public abo ut CDC's best practices and guide- lines and the need to secure ongoi ng funding f or the Division of Tobacco Use Prevention and Control.

This c hapter, am ong other thi ngs, estab- lishes the existence of the Iowa Co mmission on Tobacco Use Prevention and Control, as well as the Division of Tobacco Use Prevention and Control, within the Iowa Depart ment of Public Health. 214 Goal Statement Reduce to 10 % Iowans' exposure to sec- ondhand smoke in the w orkplace. Base- line, 2002 Io wa Adult Tob acco Survey: 25.8% of those survey ed rep orted being expo sed to sec- ondh and smoke in the workpla ce one or more days a wee k. Rationale Secondhand s moke (SHS) is the third lead- ing cause of preventable death in this country . Approxim ately 50 0 Iowans die every year as a result of expo sure to secondhand sm oke. Work- ers in sm oke-filled environments face an even higher risk of secondhand smoke -related death and disease. Research has shown secondhand smoke to cause heart disea se and stroke, as well as lung, nasal and sinus, ut erus, liver, and kidne y cancer s. Workplace exposure to SHS causes more death a nd disease than all other regulated occupational substances co mbined. Secondhand smoke is harmful in even very small quantities, and Iowans are exposed to high levels of it eve- ryday in their workplace. 214.1 Action Step By 2006, obtain list of all Iowa em ployers and surve y employers to establish basel ine data on the percen tage of em ployers with smoke-free policies.

Chap ter 2 1 - Page 8 of 20 April 2005 Tobacco Use HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision 215 Goal Statement Implement comprehensive tobacco poli- cies in 100 % of Iowa school districts that include bans on 1) tobacco an ywhere on school property , in sc hool-affiliated ve- hicles, or at school sponsored events and 2) the promotion of tobacco prod- ucts on clothing or related accessory items b y students or staff w hile on school property or at school sponsored events. The policies s hould 1) be clearl y stated in the student handbook, 2) be supported b y the use of adequate sign- age on school property and regul ar an- nouncements of the polic y, and 3) in- clude an established action plan for en- forcement. Baseli ne: Currently unde r as- sessment. Rationale Schools are im portant venues in the batt le against tobacco disease an d death because stu- dents are at a n age where they are partic ularly vulnerable to experi mentation with tobacco. According to the 200 2 Iow a Youth Toba cco Surve y Repor t, 17% of Iow a's 8th graders and 37% of Iowa's 12th graders have used tobacco within the pa st 30 da ys. Interventions at school are crucial to stemming thi s experim entation, which can lea d to addiction, disease and death. Student attitudes further reflect the need for strong school tobacco poli cies and interventions. Although a majority of m iddle and hig h school students polle d agreed that sm oking (bot h pas- sive and aggressive) does damage to a person' s physical health, 13% of m iddles school students and 17% of high school st udents believed that smoking for one to two years and quitti ng woul d be a safe choi ce. At the sa me ti me, 20% of all students believed that stude nts who sm oke ciga- rettes have more friends. This discrepa ncy may describe why 70% to 73% of all students clai m to have spent one or m ore of the last seven da ys exposed to secondhand sm oke. Young peopl e form many of their attitudes and shape man y of their behaviors at school. School tobacco policies are i mportant in inform - ing students a bout t he risks of tobacco and shap- ing attitudes toward tobacco, as well as i n pro- tecting studen ts from the dangers of secondhand smoke. School polices are, in effect, \"role mod- els\" in this regard and sa y that using tobacco is either a \"har mful and destructive decision\" or \"no big deal.\" In addition, I owans have a particular interest in school p olicies because most school b uildings and grou nds are publicl y owned. Public debate is needed about the role of public instit utions in stemming behavior that ha s such im portant health and econom ic consequences. Iowans agree that schools should be safe places. Local debates are n eeded to persuade polic ymakers that the conc ept of safety should include safety from exposure to tobacco prod- ucts, messages and secondhand sm oke. These debates will also further awareness of the dan- gers of tobacco throughout the community. Some additional considerations appl y to post-secondary schools. S moking rates among college-age youth are parti cularly high - the highest for an y single age g roup. Risk of expo- sure to secondhand sm oke is considerable in college dorm itories and recreational facil ities that do not ba n sm oking. In addition, college- age y oung people are role m odels for yo unger students as they consider whether to engage in tobacco use. Comprehensive policies in post-secondary schools shoul d include a ba n on secondhand smoke any where on school propert y, in school- affiliated vehicles, or at sch ool sponsored events. A com prehensive polic y should (1) be clearly stated in the student handbo ok, (2) be supported b y the use of adequate signage on school proper ty and regular announcem ents of the polic y, and (3) include an establishe d action plan for enfor cement. 215.1 Action Step By 2005, con duct a com prehensive survey of school p olicies to determine how many schools currentl y have com prehensive tobacco policies. Survey results will provide a baseline for future m easure ment of the succes s of this strategy . (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health action step.)

(An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health action step.) 215.6 Action Step By 2005, establish a baseline of post- secondary institutions i n Iowa with co mprehen- sive tobacco policies. (An A merican Ca ncer Society action step.) 216 Goal Statement Increase to 69 % the nu mber of adults aged 18 and older w ho report not allo w- ing smoking an ywhere in the home and increase to 65 % the nu mber of adults aged 18 and older w ho report not allo w- ing smoking inside vehicles. Baseline, 2002 Adult T obacco Surve y: 59.7% of a ll adults reported that smoking was not allowed a ny- where in thei r home and 5 5.1% of all adults re- ported that smokin g wa s banne d in the family car. Rationale Secondhand s moke (SHS) is a major source of indoor air conta minants. Tobacco s moke is a dynamic, co mplex mixture of m ore that 4,00 0 chem icals found in both vapor and particle phases. Many of these chemical s are known toxic or carcinogenic agent s. Nonsm oker's ex- posure to SH S-related toxic and carcinogenic substances would occur in indoor spaces where there is s moking, such as in hom es, cars and other vehicles. The Envir onmental Protection Agency (EPA ) has classifi ed secondhand sm oke as a \"Cl ass A\" carcinogen containing as bestos and benzene. Breathing secondhan d smoke can make children suffer serious health risks. Approxi- mately 43% of A merican c hildren aged 2 to 11 are exposed to secondhand smoke at home. Studies show that children of parents who sm oke are m ore susceptible to lung illnesses su ch as pneum onia and bronchitis. This is true espe- cially with infants. And, because smoking par- ents are more likely to cough and spread ger ms, their children are more like ly to develop chest illnesses. Secondhand s moke is a major cause of car- diovascular diseas e and death. Inhaling second- hand smo ke from just one cigarette actually in- creas es the gr owth rate of plaque, which is the buildup of fatty substances on artery walls that leads to arterial hardening and blockage s. Women who are exposed to SHS at ho me have a 23% to 24 % increased risk of cardiovascular disease. (Sources from the American Heart Association and U.S. envir onmental Pro tection Agency .)

April 2005 Chap ter 2 1 - Page 11 of 2 0 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Tobacco Use 217 Goal Statement Decrease to 18 % the p roportion o f adults aged 18 and older w ho smoke cigarettes, decrease to 28 % the proportion of adults aged 18 to 24 who sm oke cigarettes, de- crease to 25 % the pro portion of adults in households with inco mes less than $25,000 per year w ho smoke cigarettes, and increase to 75 % the proportion of adult tobacco-use cessation attempts. Baselin e, 200 3 Surveillan ce adults in Iowa reported smoking cigarettes, 36% of adu lts aged 18 to 24 rep orted sm oking cigarettes, 28 .9% of adults in h ouseholds with i ncomes less than $25,00 0 per y ear repo rted being curre nt smo k- ers, an d 50.5 % of adults in Iowa rep orted that they attempted to quit smo king. Rationale Tobacco use continues to plague our nation. According to the Center for Disea se Control and Prevention (C DC), an esti mated 46.2 m illion adults in the United States smoke cigare ttes even though this si ngle behavior will result in death or disabilit y for half of all r egular sm okers. More than 8.6 m illion people in the Uni ted States have at least one seri ous illness caused by smoking. If c urrent patterns of sm oking con- tinue, 6. 4 million peo ple currentl y youn ger than age 18 will di e prem aturely from a tobacco- related disease. According to the 200 3 Iow a Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sy stem (BRFSS), 21.7% of respondents surve yed repor ted being a cu rrent smoker. This num ber is down slightl y from the 23.2% report ed in the 2002 Iowa BRFSS. His- torically , there has been a level trend in adult tobacco use in Iowa over the past seven y ears. Recognizing t hat this trend has continued for more than five y ears, the goal of 13% stated in the original version of Healthy Iowans 2 010 has been revised to 18% to create a goal that is both challenging yet realistic. In this sam e report, 24 .5% who were sur- veyed were former sm okers or someone who has smoked 100 c igarettes in their lifetim e but no longer sm oke. Approxim ately 59% of sm okers aged 18 to 24 made an attem pt to quit during t he past y ear, com pared to 41.3% of persons aged 55 to 64 (Iow a BRFSS, 2003). In additi on, the percentage of adults who s moke that live in households w ith annual i ncomes of less t han $25,000 rem ains higher tha n the state average at 28.9% .

Tobacco dependence is a c hronic disease with identifiable etiology and re missions. However, ef- fective treat ments are avail able. The availability of evidence based/best pra ctices cessation op- portunit ies, along with nicotine replacement products, has proven t o be a successful com bina- tion in adult tobacco cess ation. It is cruc ial that cessation opportunities are increased thr oughout the state, especially among clinicians. Brief in- terventions us ing the 5 A's (ask, advise, asse ss, assist, arr ange) and the well-planned us e of nico- tine replacement prod ucts, provide t he tools for succes s when attempting tobacco ces sation. Cessation cou nseling can b e provided through various avenues. \"Quitline Iowa\" is a pro-active tobacco cessatio n counseling hotline available free of charge to all Iowans. The quit line is operated by the Iow a Tobacco Re search Center in the Department of Community and Behavioral H ealth at the University of Iowa, and is funded thr ough m aster settlem ent funds by the Division of Tobacco Use P revention and Con- trol, Iowa Departm ent of Public Health.

Baseli ne, 2003, Iowa Departm ent of Public Health , Bureau of Vital Statistics: 15.8% of women who gave birth re porte d smo king du ring pre gnancy. Rationale In the United States, more than 20% of all women sm oke cigarettes. Many of thes e wo men smoke while they are pregnant. Pregna nt women who sm oke subject both t hemselves and their fetuses t o increased health risk, including spontaneous abortion ( natural expulsio n of em - bryo or nonviab praevia (placenta developing in lower uterine s egment with possible partial pre mature separatio n); pre- term labor and deliver y (before 37th week of gestation); decreas ed birth weight; and pre ma- ture ru pture of the am nion (mem - brane that produces a mniotic fluid and covers the bab y). The more a pregnant wom an smokes, the greater the risk to her baby . Statistics fro m the United States ar e com pel- ling. Accordi ng to t he U.S. Public Health Ser- vice, if all pregnant wom en in the United States stopped sm oking, there wo uld be an esti mated 11% reduction in stillbir ths and a 5% reduction in newborn deaths. In 200 2, 19% of Iowa women reported sm oking d uring pregnan cy (Iowa Department of Publi c Health, Bureau of Vital Statistics). April 2005 Chap ter 2 1 - Page 13 of 2 0 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Tobacco Use Recent studie s show that the levels of ser um cotinine was about eight times higher in bottle- fed infants of smoking m others than in bottle-fed infants of no n-smoking m others. But am ong children of s moking mothers, infants who were breast-fed ha d cotinine levels 10 tim es higher than those of bottle-fed inf ants. Researchers have found significantl y higher cotinine levels in infants of no n-smoking m others who were ex- posed to tobacco through sm oking by another household member, with no difference related to feeding ( Healthy Iowans 2 010). In the com prehensive progr am offered b y Quitline Iowa, counselors deter mine a to bacco- use pattern and readiness to quit, discuss the health effects of tobacco, help form ulate an in- dividualized quit plan , and ask perm ission to place up to three pro-active follow-up ca lls and send supporti ng m aterials. The intensiv e pro- gram gives tobacco users who are read y to quit within 30 days an opport unity to work one-on- one with the s ame counselor throug hout the process and to receive up to ten \"relapse sensi- tive\" follow-up calls clustered around t he quit date and then scheduled out to six weeks after the original c all date. The relapse prevention progra m helps preg- nant wom en who quit sm oking because of their pregnanc y to avoid relapse and rem ain sm oke free after the birth of their baby . Wom en are assigned to one counselor who works with them for up to four sessions, foc using on areas such as coping strategies to deal with cravings, s upport systems, and concerns re garding role transitions and interpersonal relationships. 218.1 Action Step By 2007, increase the nu mber of individuals enrolled in th e relapse prev ention pr ogram for pregnant women through Quitline Iowa.

Baselin e: As of Decembe r 2004, the Me dicaid program in Io wa did n ot cover any of the to- bacco d ependence treatm ents re commende d in He alth Service Clini cal Practi ce Guideli Use a nd Depen d- ence. Rationale In Iowa, the availability of cessation ser- vices for individuals dependent on Medicaid insurance is non-existent. Presently , Iowa' s Medicaid sy stem does not p rovide total c overage of approved nicotine replacem ent products or behavioral therapies. Eli minating this barrier to health service s can potentially increase t he num - ber of individuals who see k assistanc e in quit- ting tobacco use. Smoking exa cts a substantial toll on I owa. As of FY2004, tobacco-related diseas e and deaths drained approx imately $794 million in annual health care costs. An estim ated $235 million in Iowa taxpay er dollars were spent on Medicaid payments alone for residents with smoking-related illnesses. To elim inate the disparity that is created by not funding cessation servi ces though Medicaid, key legislators must be identified and educated on this health care issue. S pecial efforts by key indivi duals and agencies throug hout the state will be necessary to m ove this issue forward. 219.1 Action Step By 2006, ide ntify key stakeholders to pr o- mote Medicaid reim bursement for Foo d and Drug Adm inistration (FDA)-approved pharma- cotherapies.

(An Iowa Departm ent of Publ ic Health and Tobacco Free I owa action step.) 2110 Goal Statement Decrease to 5 % the cu rrent (w ithin the past 30 da ys) use of any tobacco p rod- uct in grades 6 to 8, decrease to 24 % the current (w ithin the past 30 da ys) use of any tobacc o product in grades 9 to 12, increase to 75 % the nu mber of current high school students w ho smoke and report w anting to quit, reduce to 30 % the current cigarette use of Native American youth, decrease to 10% the perc ent of high school students w ho think s moking cigarettes makes young people look cool and/or fit in, and decrease to 10 % the percent of middle school students who think smoking cigarettes makes young people look cool and/or fit in. Baseline, 2002 Io wa Yo uth Toba cco Survey: 11% current (within the p ast 30 days) u se of any tob acco products in grade s 6 to 8, 34% current (within the past 30 d ays) u se of a ny tobacco produ cts in grades 9 to 1 2, 63% of high school students who smoke repo rt wantin g to qu it, 39.8% of Native American you th in 11th grad e were cu rrent smokers, 15 % of high sch ool stud ents t houg ht that smo king cigarettes m akes young p eople look cool a nd/or fit in, and 16% of middl e school stude nts thou ght that smo king cig arettes make s young pe ople look cool an d/or fit in. Rationale Research shows that pro-sm oking attitudes form in childhood or by early adolescence. The 1994 Surgeo n General's Report, Preventing To- bacco Use Among Yo ung People , concluded that teens are at ri sk for t obacco use because they perceive that tobacco use is normal, approved of by their peers and siblings, and beneficial to their lifesty le. According to the 200 2 Iow a Youth Toba cco Surve y, 66% of hig h schoo l students reported having tried tobacco so me time during their life, while 37% of m iddle school students made the same report. Over half of the high scho ol stu- dents who us e tobacco (63%) express ed a desire to quit . Whe n 11th grade students from Iowa were asked if they had tried to qui t, 10% had attem pted once, 4% had attem pted twice, and 5% had attempted three times or more (2002 Iowa Youth Surve y Report). Resear ch shows that adolesce nts are unlikely to quit on their own and the longer one uses tobacco, the more diffi- cult it is to quit. Im proving availability and ac- cess to eff ective adolescent tobacco cess ation program s are needed. 1999 Iowa You th Survey 11th grade Perc ent Total Samp le White 33.0% 23,65 d 38.7% 622 Total 33.1% 25,78 8 2002 Iowa You th Survey 11th grade Perc ent Total Samp le White 23.6% 26,96 1999 a nd 2002 Io wa Surve y, Current Ciga- rette Use.

Baseline, Alco holic Beve ompliant with youth ac - cess laws rep orted by the Iowa Alcoholi c Bever- ages. Rationale Because the majority of tobacco use initia- tion occurs in adolescence, direct measures lim- iting tobacco use in adolescence ar e imperative to the health of all Iowans. The 2002 Iowa Youth Tobacco Surve y reported a 31% decre ase in middle sch ool-aged tobacco use, and a corre- spondin g 13% reduction am ong high school youth - a sign that the Iow a Tobacco Control Initiative is headed in the right direction. The Code of I owa states that a person un der aged 18 shall not sm oke, use, possess, purchase, or atte mpt to purchase any tobacco products. It also states tha t a person shall not sell, give or otherwise suppl y any tobacco products t o any person less than 18 years of age. Howe ver, the deterrent effe cts of these st atutes are le ss effec- tive when they are not enforced equally and at all times. In order to hold retailers accountable for illegal sales, co mpliance checks con ducted at each retail e stablish ment must continue. According to the 200 2 Iow a Youth Toba cco Surve y, most middle school students obt ain cigarettes by borrowing t hem, followed b y oth- ers purchasing the cigarettes for the m. The ma- jority of high school studen ts that currently smoke (approximately 10% ) reported tha t they obtain cigarettes by having others bu y for them . In order to hold youth who illegally attempt to purchase tobacco accountable, the \"Cops in Shops\" progr am must move from an annual event to an o ngoin g initiative. \"Cops in Shops\" consists of a plain-clothed law enforcement offi- cer working behind the counter of a retail estab- lishment, citing youth who illegally attem pt to purchase or possess tobac co products. During a \"Cops in Shops\" operation, officers also keep an eye out for adults furnishing tobacco to youth. Enforcem ent of illegal toba cco sales to minors and retail lice nse suspension for sales to minors is a vital tool in lim iting youth access to tobacco products. Increas ed com pliance wit h existing tobacco statutes in order to reduce youth access to to- bacco produc ts through retail sources is a step in the right direction. The goal can best be reached throug h maintaining and e xpandin g existing partnerships am ong stakeholders that bot h iden- tify effective, responsible retailing practices to reduce the incidence of tobacco sale s to m inors, and that work at the co mmunit y level t o prevent youth access to tobacco thr ough non-retail sources. 2111.1 Action Step Throug h 2010, maintain and expand existing partnerships between law enforcem ent, retail, public health, substance abuse, and youth inter- est groups to identif y effective, responsible re- tailing practices that will keep tobacco out of the hands of Iow a youth.

Injuries are one of the state's leading causes of death. Also, many Io- wans are inc apacitated by injuries and suffer lifelong disabilities. Injuri es occur dispropor- tionatel y among youn ger and ol der peop le. Dur- ing this century , traum a has replaced infectious disease as the greatest thre at to children. In older Iowans, injuries such as hip fractures are often catastro phic and costly to the health care system . Injuries to older p ersons frequentl y leads to loss of independe nce or even death. As fro m 1993 to 19 95, unintentional inj uries remain the le ading cause of death for pe rsons aged 1 thro ugh 34. Data from the Centers for Disea se Control and Preve ntion indicate that injuries were the leading cause of death in years of potential li fe lost before age 65 duri ng 1999 to 20 01. Many strides, such as i mplementation of strong occupa nt and child safety restraint laws and the decrease to .08 for the legal blood alco- hol lim it, have resulted from awarenes s of Healthy Iowans 201 0. Strong cadres of injury prevention advocates have helped to assure the continued growth of child-passenger saf ety seat technolog y, increased use of the poiso n control center's supp ort, and publi c information and education outlets for the state of Iowa. This mid-course re view shows that many action steps have been com pleted, new ones established, and old ones restr uctured to m eet changing needs. People in pre dominately rural states such as Iowa are at hi gher risk fo r injury than those of more urban states. Far m workers and their fa mi- lies are exposed to greater hazards than those who live in cities and towns. A study by Ja mes Merchant et al in 19 94 fr om the University of Iowa found t hat death rates were higher in rural Iowa counties than in urban counties for firear m injuries, m otor vehicle injuries, burns, suicides, drownings, a nd farm injuries. Obviousl y, in a rural state suc h as Iowa, agricultural-rela ted in- juries are pre valent. Farmers have many fatal and nonfatal i njuries caused b y agricult ural ma- chinery or farm animals.

Cra shes resulted in over 1,300 fatalities in Iowa duri ng 1999 t o 2001. The goo d news as describ ed further in t his chap- ter is that Iowa has had a steady decrease in the number of crash-related deaths. This has been attributed to i ncreased occupant pr otection. In i- tiatives such as enforcement of . 08 and stronger occupant prot ection laws will be valuabl e in re- ducing t his cost and hum an burden . In recent y ears, injur y began to receive long overdue recognition as a major public health problem . Att ention focused prim arily on the toll April 2005 Chap ter 2 2 \u2014 Page 1 of 15 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Unintentional Injuries in lives lost and the resulti ng econom ic costs. Although specific injur y prevention pr ojects ex- ist, it is difficult to obtain c omprehensiv e injur y data.

However, it is clear that de aths from injuries are the tip of the iceberg. National data indicate that for every one injury-related death there are 18 hospital di scharges, 260 em ergency depart- ment visits, and 4 00 episo des of injurie s re- ported. (See g raphics below.) Falls are the leading cause of nonfatal in ju- ries and often result in head injuries in c hildren and adults. I n Iowa, many falls occur to children when they are using pla yground eq uipm ent. Among the elderly , falls cause broken hi ps and other fractures, which require a long recover y. There are far too m any causes of injuries to be able to cover them all in this chapter. Several have been selected for e mphasis due to their enorm ous public health impact. Emergency Medical Serv ices (EMS) in the Iowa Department of Publ ic Health made consid- erable progress in the last 20 years. Improve- ments resulted from initiating a s ystem s ap- proach and fr om the integration of stand ardized rescue vehicl es, co mmunications, medic al equipm ent, training pr ograms, emergency facili- ties, and critical care hospital capabilities. Readers can a ppreciate that injuries cause Iowans significant public h ealth problems. Thoug h tremendous gains have been made in preventing or reducing the severity of so me inju- ries, such as motor vehicle -related injuries, bet- ter injur y control is still gr eatly needed i n Iowa. Following is a very brief summary of ac- complishments in injur y prevention sinc e the year 20 00: Legislative, Occupant Protection: Upd ate of the child passenger restrain t law to allow further protection of older children . Introd uced in 20 02, passed into law in 2004. Legislative, .08 Bloo d Alcohol Level: Leg- islation was passed in 2003 to lower the blood alcohol level to .08 . Grassroots Coalition Buil ding: The I owa SAFE Kids C oalition successfully implemented a grassroots coalition-building to generate the support of ov er 450 agenci es for occupant pro- tection of chil dren. Child Safety Seat Education: Over 500 Io- wans wer e certified as child passenger s afety seat te chnicians who provide education to Iowa parents and caregivers on child occupant protec- tion. Data Trends: The use of child passenger safety seats a nd adult occupant restraint sy stems has increas ed to an all-tim e high. Iowa leads the National Highway Traffic Safety Adm inistra- tion's Region 7 for occupa nt restraint use and decrease in roadway fatalities. Data Trends: Since World War II, the Iowa death toll has reached an all -time low. Chap ter 2 2 \u2014 Page 2 of 15 April 2005 Unintentional Injuries HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Goal Statements & Action Steps 221 Goal Statement Enhance Iow a's Emergenc y Medical Ser- vices (EMS) s ystem b y implementing an integrated data s ystem with unif orm EMS data elements and linkage with 75 % of Iowa's EMS s ystems a nd b y main taining Iowa's trauma care delivery system at 100%. Baseline: EMS system, 2004, 3 4%; trauma care system, 1999, 0%. Rationale An effective Emergency Medical Serv ices (EMS) sy stem with a dedicated trau ma sy stem component can im prove the survivabilit y of se- verely injured persons. Th e minutes directly following tra umatic injuries are often cri tical to save the victim 's life or to reduce the eff ects of injuries. Iowa has 900 authorized E MS program s and over 14, 000 c ertified EMS staff that deliver emergency medical care to the ill and inj ured. Of EMS staff , 78% are volunteers, 15% are ca- reer emergen cy medical personnel, and t he re- maining 7% are a co mbination of volunteer and paid s ystems. The timeliness and the level of expertise of care are critical. Emerge ncy care scenari os are markedly different in urban, rural and rem ote settings. Each scenario re quires strateg ies tai- lored to m eet its problem s. As the lead a gency for EMS, the Bureau of Emergency Medical Serv ices in the Iowa De- partm ent of Public Health provides leadership and resources for EMS s ystem develop ment. This includes attention to trauma and pediatric needs. Emer gency Medic al Services fo r Chil- dren (EMSC) is the lead program for injury pre- vention i nitiatives and proj ects. Grants for pre- vention are disse minated st atewide. The Bureau of EMS seeks to im prove the health of Iowans through preve ntion of the need for acute care and rehabilitation for t he ill and injured. Creating EMS' future is not easy . Participa- tion at local, count y and regional levels is criti- cal if EMS is to take the lead in pr oviding for the out-of-h ospit al health care of Iowa's mmuni-ties. Fundin g to supp ort co h system devel opment is cru cial. The we akest link in the he alth care sy stem is reli ance on a volunteer out -of-hospital/f acility care provider. Such depende nce could lead to the discontinua- tion of care, increasing illness, and death. 221.1 Action Step Through 2010, continue efforts to secure fundin g that s upports t he emergency medical services infra structure.

Rationale Falls are the leading cause of nonfatal in ju- ries. They often result in head injuries in chil- dren and adul ts. Am ong th e elderly , falls cause broken h ips as well as other fractures, which require long r ecovery perio ds. Nationally, falls are the secon d leading cause of death after motor vehicles. By reducing falls and related injuries, the num ber of deaths will also decrease. April 2005 Chap ter 2 2 \u2014 Page 3 of 15 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Unintentional Injuries Few children died from falls in Iowa in 1 997 (two males in the 0 to 4 age category ). The number was greatest for people in the 8 5 and above age range (49 m en and 1 06 wom en). In the 75 to 84 a ge group , 50 males and 33 females died. Iowa has a co nsiderably larger older popula- tion than most states; the 1990 age-adjus ted mortality rate was 3.1 per 100,000, whic h is above the fed eral Healthy People 2000 age- adjusted baseline of 2. 7 per 100, 000 in 1987 . By 1997, Iow a's rate had increased to 11. 5 per 100,000. In addition to being a serious m ortality risk for older adul ts, hip fractures have high f inancial and ps ychological costs. They are a public health proble m of crisis proportio ns. A n esti- mated 4,300 persons were hospitalized for hip fractures in 1995, costing $52 m illion j ust for the acute car e. White wome n aged 85 and older are at the highest risk. Since Iowa has a high percentage of citizens aged 85 and older, the issue of falls and hip frac- tures is significant. Without successful initia- tives to reduce falls and hip fractures, the alloca- tion of health resources in this and the ne xt cen- tury coul d be staggering. T he total direct cost of injuries from falls in 1994 among peopl e aged 65 and older was $20.2 bil lion. Thoug h potentially prevent able, falls and fall-related injuries are co mmon cause s of func- tional decline and increase d health care use among the elderly . Exercise can reduce the risk of falling by at least 10% a nd m ore whe n it in- cludes balanc e exercis es. 222.1 Action Step By 2006, convene a su mmit on falls to dis- cuss statisti cs, public awareness, preven tion, and laws associat ed with fall-related hospitalizations. (An Advisor y Council o n Brain Injuries action step.) 222.2 Action Step By 2007, with inform ation collected at the summit on fall-related injuries, develop a public awar eness c ampaign to pre vent falls.

Rationale Head injuries are the most common of se- vere disabling injuries in the United States. People classif ied with m ild head injuries may suffer disabilities ranging f rom headaches to psychosocial and behavior al problem s which prevent them from returning to work. Moderate and severe he ad injury consequences ar e better known. T hey may include psychosocial and cognitive (abi lity to learn) effects that can cause life-long disa bility and poorer qualit y of life. They can also leave a perso n at greater risk for further injur y. Most likel y to be injured are very young children, young persons ag ed 15 to 24, and th ose aged 65 and over. In 1 997, males experienced 65% of all inj uries. Nationally , most head inju- ries are cause d by motor ve hicle crashe s, fol- lowed by falls dence accordi ng to socioec onom ic groups. Once a person has had a traumat ic brain injury, their risk is higher for another in jury or a secondar y disabilit y.

Rationale In 2002, 70% of spinal cord injuries oc- curred to m ales. Of total spinal cord injuries, 54% were ag ed 25 thr ough 54 and 22% were older than 64. Motor vehicle crashe s were the leading cause of spinal cord injury (28% ), with falls second ( 23%) and no n-traffic transportation third (5%). This goal has the sa me action steps as goals 222 and 223. Goal 22\u20142 action steps focus on reducing injuries caused b y falls, an d goal 22\u20143 action steps focus on reducing i njuries caused by motor vehicle crashes. Reduc tion in these injuries is expected to reduce spinal cord injuries. 225 Goal Statement Establish a program in all Io wa counties for progres sive resistance training to prevent falls among the elderl y. Baseli ne: See Ration ale. Rationale Falls remain the leading cause of nonfat al injuries. Reducing their num ber will also result in a reduction in the n umber of deaths, hi p frac- tures, and fun ctional decline am ong the elderly. Falls and fall-related injuries are potentially avoidable. B y showing t he elderly the benefits of phy sical fitness and providing them with training, t hey can im prove their qualit y of life and abilit y to live independently. 225.1 Action Step By 2010, establish a progra m of progressive resistanc e training for the state' s elderly .

Baseli ne: See Ra - tionale. Rationale Iowa must reduce the number of pla yground injuries. It is estimated that 2,385 childre n an- nuall y are inj ured on playgrounds seriou sly enough to req uire a hospital em ergency room visit. To reduce the num ber, several a ction steps are needed. First, a co mmon recording and tracking sys- tem that allows officials t o better determine the causes of injuries and identify way s to prevent them must be developed. It is critical to asse ss the condition and safety of all public pla y- grounds in Iowa. The initial assessment will establish a ba seline for measuring progress. The assessment should be done at five-y ear intervals. A play ground educational program is needed. It would i nclude supervision g uidelines, age-appropriate design, surfaces, and equipm ent maintenance. Training m aterials that provide appropriate guidance to individuals and agencies on how to inc rease the safety of pla ygrounds are also needed. To ensure uniform ity and com pli- ance across Iowa, national pla yground s afety guidelines an d standards should be ado pted for all playgrou nds. 227.1 Action Step By 2010, dev elop a common recording and tracking s ystem for injuries on pla ygrou nd equipm ent. The current sy stem for tracki ng in- juries in rural areas can be extended to include all children in jured on playgroun ds and t aken to hospitals.

Base- line: In 2001 i n Iowa, unint entional p oisoning caused 56 de aths. Source : WISQARS (Web - Based Inju ry Statistics Q uery and Repo rting System). Rationale Poisonings are a major cause of injury and death, the m ajority of whic h are unintent ional. In 2001, m ore than 2.2 m illion calls were made to poison control centers in the United States, 85% of which were for un intentional ex posures to substances. In the same year, the National Center for Injur y Preventio n and Contr ol (NCIPC) rep orted over 2 2,000 poisoni ng deaths nationwide, 6 3% of which were unintentional. In contrast to NCIPC data, the 200 1 Ann ual Report of the American Association of P oison Control Cent ers (AAPCC) docum ented only 1,074 deaths, of which onl y ( 32%) would probabl y fit I CD-10 codin g for u nintent ional poisoning dea th. The substances most com- monly cited i n unintention al deaths in 2 001 were, in descending freque ncy: narcotics, acetaminophen, cocaine, am phetamines, carbon monoxide, ethanol, and benzodiazepines. The AAPCC reported 51% of their deaths as suici- dal, com pared to 2 3% for t he NCIPC. It should be noted that intentional ex posures might result in an uni ntent ional death. For exam ple, a person intentionall y abusing heroi n to get high may un- intentionall y die from overdose. Poisoning affects people of all ages. In 2001, 52% of hum an exposures to substances reported to poison contr ol centers were i n chil- dren under ag e six. However, NCIPC death rates for unin tentional pois onings are mainly The hig hest unin-tentional pois oning death r ate is for people in their late 30's to late 40 's. A second, smaller increase exist s in the rate for people in their 80' s and older. Nearly 90% of poisoni ngs called into po ison control centers occur in the hom e. In 2001, the substances most frequently cited were an alge- sics, cleaning products, per sonal care products, foreign bo dies, plants, sedatives, and col d/cough preparations. Poisonin gs also are a significant economic burden on society . According to the N CIPC, an estimated 743 ,000 people were seen for poison- ing in em ergency rooms in 2001 . In t hat year, poison centers received sli ghtly fewer than 500,000 calls from people who were cared for at a health care facility . Facil ities include emer- gency departments, urgent care centers, and physician offices. The cos ts for treat ment of unintenti onal poisonin gs in the United St ates in 1997 were more than $3 billion. Current annual costs are estimated at $22 billion. The original goal state ment has been revised to reflect a more realistic, yet still aggressive goal. No m andator y poiso n exposure reporting exists in Iowa and the Iowa Poison Cente r is a passive data c ollection s ystem. This lead s to a significant discrepancy between the actu al num - ber of poiso nings and th ose that are phon ed into the center. This is highlighted by the fact that there were 13 7 poiso ning deaths in Iowa in 2001 , yet the Iowa Poison Control Cent er re- ceived onl y nine fatality -related calls. 228.1 Action Step By 2010, incr ease to 100% the proportion of Iowa resident s with acce ss to a certified regional poison co ntrol center 24 ho urs a day , seven day s a week. Currently, over 98% of Iowans have telephone service and all 9 9 counties are ser- viced by the Iowa Poison Center. The center applied for certification in 2002 and will become certified whe n the m edical director passes the Medical Toxicolog y board certification exam .

(An Iowa Depart- ment of Publi c Health actio n step.) 228.4 Action Step By 2010, perf orm a thorou gh annual rev iew of Centers for Disea se Control and Preve ntion mortality data , death certificates on file with the Iowa Department of Publi c Health Bureau of Vital Statistics, and hospita l discharge data to deter mine the most common causes of poison- ings and poisoning fata lities, and determine the proporti on of deaths that received medical inter- vention. (An Iowa Poison Center action step.) 228.5 Action Step By 2010, increase the Iow a Poison Cente r's penetrance wi thin Iowa to 10.2. Penetrance is defined b y the AAPCC as the num ber of hum an poison ex posure calls handled b y poison centers per 1,00 0 peo ple per year. This is used as a sur- rogate marker for effective ness of poison control outreach and education. (An Iowa Poison Cen- ter action step.) 229 Goal Statement Reduce Iowa's fire death rate to less than 1 per 100,000 people. Baseline: The rate has ave raged slightly over 1.7 per 10 0,000 peo - ple duri ng the 1990 s, 29th highest in the nation, according to the Natio nal F ire Prote ction Asso - ciation. Rationale Fire deaths ar e the fourth le ading cause of unintenti onal injur y deaths in the United States. Typically, 75 % to 80% of them occur in the home. The very youn g and the elderl y are most likely to die as a result of fire. Early warning and quick res ponse b y occupants can pr event most resident ial fire deaths . When properly in- stalled and maintained, s moke detectors are a very effective means of providing early warning. To im plemen t effective prevention, it is es- sential to understand where fire injuries occur and to whom , and to collec t other inform ation to target at-risk groups i n Iowa. Therefore, accu- rate data gathering, c ouple d with educational program s, can do m uch to improve Iowa's fire death rate. To produce the desired i mpact on fire death rates, responsible personnel need the time and resources to develop a focused, statewid e fire- prevention program . New materials need to be developed and educational presentations m ust be provided in s chools, at health care facilities, and elsewher e as needed. A position to handle these responsibiliti es would also include seeking out and m aking applications fo r fire safety grants. 229.1 Action Step By 2010, foc us public fire safety education on children by prov iding various educational curricula (with form ats for special popul ations), such as Learn to Not Burn or Risk Watch, in preschools and elem entary schools.

Ap proxim ately 43,000 people die each y ear and m ore than 3.2 m illion are injured. Society loses nearly $230 billion in m edical costs, lost wages, and loss of prod uctivit y annu- ally due to m otor vehicle crashes. In Iowa, nearly 2,2 00 persons died in aut o- mobile crashes during 1999 to 20 03, an d over 170,000 peop le were injured. In 2003, the motor vehicle death rate was 1.4 per 100 m illion vehi- cle miles trav eled. To sustain the goal of 1.3 per 100 m illion, t he num ber of fatal crashes must be reduced b y approxim ately 10 deaths per year until 2010. Careful consideration s hould be given to any proposal to increas e the spe ed lim it on Iowa' s roadway s. Evidence clearl y dem onstrat es that more people are killed and seriously injured as speed increas es. Increasin g the speed limit in a state such as I owa with a high num ber of older drivers can cr eate potentially dangerous situa- tions involvi ng vehicles traveling at significantly different spee ds on the same roadway s. 2210.1 Action Step By 2010, analy ze the costs and benefits of requiring driver education for all first-time driv- ers prior to receiving a license.

Base line, 2004: Io wa data b ased on occup ant ob servation su rveys indi re using se atbelts, and 84% of childre n unde r the ag e of 6 were restrain ed. Rationale Iowa' s child restraint laws have been in ef- fect since 1985 and the seat belt law since July 1986. In 2004, a grassroots effort was success- ful in strengt hening I owa's occupant pr otection law to increas e the safety of passengers aged 3 to 11. Mone y received from the Governor's Traffic Safety Bureau pay s for law enforcement and education on occupant protection, seat belt training for la w enforcement personnel, child safety seat cli nics, and the statewide annual child restraint survey. At 87%, Iowa' s seat belt use rate is the highest am ong all 12 states in the greater Midw est and seventh highest in the na- tion. Achievem ent of the 90% use goal will re- quire a num ber of efforts, including improved design of occ upant pr otection s ystems, a con- stant enforcement effort, and conti nual prom o- tion of awareness progra ms. 2211.1 Action Step Throug h 2010, annuall y expand efforts to prom ote use of seat belts a nd proper child re- straints in all co mmunities by conducting Spe- cial nforce ment P rograms, child pas- senger restrai nt clinics, and other educational initiatives.

They can travel at high speeds and offer little protection to the rider. The chances of serious inj ury in a collis ion are m uch greater than the y are in an autom obile. Nationally, the death rate of m otorcy clists peaks betwe en ages 18 and 24. In Iowa, m otorcycles comprise less tha n 3.6% of registered motor vehicles, but account for 8.2% of motor vehicle deaths. According to the Iowa Dep cycles occurred from through 1998. These collisions resulted in 329 f atalities and approxi- mately 10,0 00 injuries. In 1998 , 28 motorcy - clists were killed on Iowa roads, 26 (92.9%) of whom were n ot wearing hel mets. The e vidence that wearing hel mets preve nts serious head in- jury or death is co mpelling. In 1995, 40% of injured motorc ycle riders were aged 24 or younger. The highest n umber of injuries in Iowa occurred in the 16-to-24- year age group and the second highest occurred in the 24-to-3 4-year age group. The 200 0 Crash Outcome Evaluation S ys- tem (CODES) stud y found that 86% of hospital- ized motorcyclists in Iowa were not wearing helm ets. The average hospital charge for non- helmeted trau ma brain injury (TBI) m otorcy - clists was $32,65 1, which was significantl y higher than t hose TBI motorcy clists who had worn helmet ($22,2 24). 2212.1 Action Step By 2006, include a legislative advocacy ini- tiative around use of helmets for riders of m o- torcy cles, m otorized bic ycles, and bicy cles in the Iowa plan for brain injury .

Baseli ne: See Ration ale. Rationale Instruction o n the risk components (aware- ness, acc eptance, manage ment) of personal travel and m otor vehicle operation is necessary . By provi ding this inform ation as part of t he health, safety and well-being curriculum , stu- dents will have the opport unity to acqui re sur- vival skills at the onset of t heir education, which should prom ote the establishment and develop- ment of positi ve student attitudes. This i nstruc- tion will be a natural progression because cur- rent standards require that ele mentary traffic safety be taug ht in grades 1 -6 in all Iowa school districts. 2213.1 Action Step By 2008, inc orporate safety education i nto the K-12 comprehensive health education m odel for the state and im plement it in all school dis- tricts. Also, foster curriculum develop ment and schedule in-service training for teachers and administrators. (An Iowa Department of Educa- tion action st ep.) 2214 Goal Statement Reduce the number of fatal water-related injuries in Iow a to less than 30 per year. Baselin e: For 1990-199 7, Iowa ave raged 38 wa - ter-related u nintentional d eaths pe r year. They ranged from a high of 56 d eaths in 1 991 to a low of 21 death s in 1997. Source: Ce nters for Di s- ease Co ntrol and Preve ntion. Rationale Drownings were the sevent h leading cause of uni ntentio nal deaths in Iowa fro m 1993 to 1995 . Eig hty-five percent of them were among male s. Death by drowning was esp eciall y prevalent among youth and young ad ults. It is the third leadi ng cause of unintentional death for ages 1 to 9 an d the second l eading cause for ages 10 to 24. These injuries occurred in Iowa' s lakes, riv- ers, reservoirs, farm ponds, and pu blic and pri- swimming p ools and/ or spas. Unfortu- nately responsible for col- lecting infor mation on water-related injuries and deaths so it is difficult to i dentify the circum - stances surrounding m any of the incidents. However, it is fair to say that the majority of injuries occurred when people were boating, swimming, fishing, and hunting. From 1990 to 1998, 70 persons were killed while boating. Flotation de vices could have prevented m ost of these fat alities. Many injuries and/or deaths result from failure to observe ap- propriate precautions or be cause of poor judg- ment. Becaus e Iowa does not have an i mplied con- sent law, ther e is no accura te docum entation of the num ber of cases where judgm ent was clouded b y intoxication fro m alcohol or other drugs. Iowa i s the onl y state that does no t have an im plied co nsent law for boat operator s. Ac- cording t o the National Safe Boating Co uncil, approxim ately 50% of all boating m ishaps na- tionwide are alcohol-related. Stu dies in two states found that one-third of all people killed in recreational boating incide nts had a blo od alco- hol content of 0.10% or higher. Personal wate rcraft, such as jet skies and/or wave-runners, have accounted for alm ost 50% of all boating m ishaps in Iowa since 1996.

Baseline: An esti mated 91 ATV-related inci dents occurre in 2002, nearly do uble the 47 incid ents in 199 8. Rationale Off-road vehicles have incr eased in popular- ity over the past decade. T heir use is favored not only for entertain ment but also as a means of transportation in rural work. According t o the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Comm ission, the number of ATV-related fatalities has nearly doubled in the past five y ears. The number of such incident s is believed to be unrep orted. Nationally , 95% of injured ATV riders are under age 16. The estim ated num ber of children injured in AT V-related inci dents increased 94% from 1993 to 2001. This i ncrease in fatalities and injuries is alar ming to injury prevention ad- vocates.

Thro ugh i n- creased resources, public health provider s and community leaders have had m ore opportunit y to address violent and abusive behavior in Iowa. Overall, the s tate's violent crime rate ha s de- creased 8.32 % since 1998. During 1998 to 2002 , the foll owing trends in violence and abuse occurred: The rate of violent crime decre ased slig htly between 1999 and 20 01, but has begun t o in- creas e again. Iowa is ranked 36th highes t in the nation for its rate of violen t crim e (Uniform Crim e Report 200 2). Murder rates decrea sed from 1.9 per 100,000 i n 1998 to 1.5 in 2002. Iowa is ranked 46th highest in that category. Forcible rape increased fro m 25.4 per 100,000 i n 1998 to 27.1 in 2002 . Iowa's na- tional rankin g is 35th highes t. Domestic abuse increased 5.5% since 1998. The 200 2 rate was 284 per 100, 000 population. Suicide and firear m mortali ty rates de- creased slightly from 1996 to 20 00 (Iow a Health Fact Book 20 03). Reports of confirmed child abuse and ne- glect cas es increas ed dra matically in the past six years, from 13.1 per 1 ,000 in 19 98 to 20.4 in 2003 . The in creases are attributed to neglect and drug-related abuse. Iowa 's rate is much higher than the natio nal rate (12.3 per 1,00 0 in 2002), but it is difficult to com pare because of s tate variations in child-abuse laws (Iowa Departm ent of Human Services, 2003). The num ber of reported cases of dependent adult abuse in creased 68.9 % from 1996 to 20 03. The increase s in reports of domestic abuse, forcible rape, child abu se, and dependent adult abuse may be m ore indicative of the pu blic's willingness to report the c rimes than actual in- creas es in cri me rates. Progress on goals and action steps included in Healthy Io wans 201 0 Chapter 23 sin ce 1999 include: Identif ying rates for intimate partner vio- lence and sexual violence in Iowa throu gh data obtained fro m Iowa's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sy stem (BRF SS) survey.

April 2005 Chap ter 2 3 - Page 1 of 13 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Violent & Abusive Be havior Obtaining a grant to im prove public hea lth's capacity to de creas e risk fa ctors and increase protective factors that prev ent youth violence. During the fir st half of the Healthy Iowans 2010 plan, m uch progress has been made to combat violent and abusiv e behavior. T here is still a need for indivi duals and comm unities to develop capacity for alternatives to violence in resolving conflict and to increase collab oration across discipl ines for education, prevention, de- tection, and i ntervention. According to the World Health Organization, use of a social- ecological model that incorporates strat egies at the indivi dual, family, comm unity , social, and institutional l evel are need ed to sufficientl y ad- dress the co mplexity of violence. The status of, and changes reco mmended in, the ori ginal goals and action steps for Chapter 23 are discussed below. Goal Statements & Action Steps 231 Goal Statement Reduce the risk of victimization from vio- lent crime (murder, sexual assault, rob- bery , and a ggravated assault) to few er than 300 per 100,000 people and main- tain the risk of homicide at or below 2.0 per 100,000 people annuall y. Basel ine, Iowa Uniform Crime Report, 1997: 308.5 violent crimes; 2.1 ri sk of ho micid e. Rationale Iowa' s violent cri me rate (e.g., hom icides, kidnappi ng, forcible rape, robber y, aggravated assault) has d ropped since the m id 1990' s. The violent crim e rate reached a high i n 1995 of 339 per 100, 000, but reduced t o 285.6 by 2002. T he homicide rate has been below 2.0 since 1994 , and was 1.5 i n 2002. I owa ranks 46th in the na- tion for t he number of homicides, making the state one of the safest plac es to live (Iowa Uni- form Crim e Report, 200 2). While the ov erall crime rate has droppe d, distribution of race/cultural background and age has shifted. Table 23-1 illustrates ra ce or cul- tural ethnicit y of hom icide victims and perpetra- tors from 1998 to 2 003. In 2000, the per centage of Iowa's po pulation 92.6%. Those identi fying with a Hispanic cultural heritage were 2.8%. There appear s to be an inc rease in the per- centage of Hispanics who are ho micide victims or offenders; however, African-A merica ns are still a more disproportionate group. In 2002, 38% of offenders co mmitting hom icides were African-American, even though they comprise only 2.1% of Iowa's pop ulation. This huge jump occurred onl y duri ng 2002, but will be im - portant to m onitor o ver the next few y ears. His- panics are beco ming a greater proportio n of murder victims in Iowa. From 1999 to 2002, 11% of all ho micide victims were of Hispanic origin. The proport ion of homicide offenders that are under aged 26 has been increasing since 1999 . After a low of 38% in 1999, it wa s back up to 53% in 2002 - the highest rate since 1998. Table 23-1. Percentage of homic ide victims or offe nders by race/cultura l ethnicity.

Criminal justice officials b elieve that a key in contin uing to reduce viol ent crim e is to quickly solve case s and bring perpetrators to justice. This increase s the co mmunity sense of safety and provides victims with a sense of jus- tice. In 200 1, the Iowa legislature appropriated funds for new facilities for the State Medical Exam iner and Division of Crim inal Investiga- tion. When these facilities open in March 2005, two of Chapt er 23's original action steps will be completed. It is expected that the im proved laborator y facilities, evidence storage capacity , and m orgue will i mprove the investigation and analy sis of cases. Following the passage of t he federal Vi o- lence Against Wom en Act in 19 95, funds were appropriated t o help de velop and expan d ser- vices to victims of violent crime. In addition, communities received reso urces to develop multi-disciplinary coordina ted response teams. Unfortunately, state funds for victim services were eli minated in 2002. While a s mall appro- priation was reinstated in 2004, programs have had to reduce the level of services, esp ecially to specialized populations. T hese changes will ultim ately reduce speciali zed training f or prose- cutors, law enforce ment, forensic nurses, com- munity coord inated response teams, and re- sources for victi ms of cri me to participate in the criminal justice process. S ince co mmunity pre- vention is particularly critical to addressing homicide and other violent crime, there i s con- cern about th e long-term impact on crime. 231.1 Action Step By 2007, restore $2 m illion of state funds for services t o victim s of violent crime to m ain- tain service when federal funds fluctuate and eliminate the need to transfer money from the crime victim compensation fund. (An Io wa De- partment of Justice action step.) 231.2 Action Step Through 2010, offer ongoing technical assis- tance to encourage increas ed developm ent of community violence prevention coaliti ons, coor- dinated response teams, an d comm unity policing initiatives. (An Iowa Dep artment of Public Safety , Iowa Department of Public Health, Iowa Department of Justice, and Office of Dru g Con- trol Polic y action step.) 231.3 Action Step By 2008, create a state wide authority on violence am ong African-Americans that would oversee i mplementation of reco mmendat ions to reduce disparities in arrests and violence. (An Iowa Co mmission on the Status of African- Americans a ction step.) 231.4 Action Step By 2010, im plem ent reco mmendations from the strategic plan to preve nt youth viole nce in Iowa, a project of the Iowa Department of Public Health. Dete rmine steps t o reduce risk factors and increase t he protective factors that will re- duce yout h violence in Iowa. (An Iowa Depart- ment of Publi c Health and Iowa Collaboration for Youth Developm ent action step.) 231.5 Action Step By 2007, establish an Injury Prevention Community Advisor y Group to develop a co m- prehensive injury preven tion plan f or Iowa.

(An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health and University of I owa Injur y Prevention Rese arch Cen ter action ste p.) 231.6 Action Step By 2008, increase Iow a's capacity to par- ticipate in the National Violent Death Reporting System . (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health action step.) 232 Goal Statement Reduce the follo wing rates in Io wa re- lated to firearms: firearm mortality to 5.0 deaths per 100,000 population annuall y; firearm suicide rate to fewer than 4.0 an- nuall y; and incidence of violent crimes in which a firearm is used to 25 annuall y. Baselin e: 7.6 firearm de aths pe r 100,0 00 oc- curre d in 199 (The Io wa Health Fa ct Book); 6.14 firea rm suicid es per 100,000 o ccurred in April 2005 Chap ter 2 3 - Page 3 of 13 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Violent & Abusive Be havior 1996 (Io wa Departm ent of Public Health , Vital Statistics); 39 .2 firearm s used in the com mission of violent cri mes pe r 100,000 in 19 97 (Iowa Uni- form Crime Report, 199 7.) Rationale During 19 99 to 20 00, the firearm mortality rate declined slightly . The average rate f or the decade 1990- 2000 was 7.4 per 100,000 popula- tion. The average rate of s uicide m ortality de- creas ed by the end of the decade to 11.0 per 100,000 population. The i ncidence of v iolent crimes in which a firear m was used dec reased to 33.4 per 100 ,000 i n 2002 (2003 Iowa Health Fact Book and 20 02 Iowa Uniform Crime Re- port). Intentional injur y is the 8th leading cause of death in Iowa. In addition, suicides co mprise the largest num ber of intentional injur y deaths. Suicide rates are still great er for adolescents than for other p opulation gr oups, and the risk of sui- cide is greate r in rural areas. Hom icide rates ar e greatest in metropolitan ar eas. During 2001, the Iowa Department of Publi c Health developed a limited public awareness cam paign on youth suicide prevention. A pub lic/private partnership was initiated in 2002 to de velop a strategic plan for suicide pr evention. T he Iowa Departm ent of Public Health continued t o seek funds for such activities and was suc cessful in obtaining a ca- pacity -building grant in 2004 to address risk and protective factors for youth violence, inc luding youth suicide. Implementation of I owa's Trau ma Injury Registry was delay ed, whic h lim ited the state' s capability to collect firear m injury data. This activity is als o tied to t he development of the State Medical Exam iner da tabase, which is in progress. These two activi ties, along with the hopeful expa nsion of a National Violent Death Reporting Syste m, are expected to help Iowa implem ent better firearm injury surveilla nce and improve recommendations for preventio n of such injuries. The capacity of law enforce ment to increase seizures of firearms fro m convicted offe nders was strengthened with changes in federal law, but safe and accurate storag e has continued to be a problem . Efforts such as proposed legislation in Iowa in 2001 to introduce saf ety mechanisms on firear ms have been unsuccess ful. The Cen- ters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that evi dence on the effectiveness of fire- arm laws to reduce violence is insufficie nt, but special interest groups con tinue to adv ocate for them. More resear ch in this area is ne eded to determ ine wh at type of poli cy level activities may contribute to firear m safety and injury pre- vention. 232.1 Action Step By 2007, confiscate and properly store all firear ms poss essed by or accessible to the perpe- trator of any crime of violence in which a fire- arm is used or displa yed, especially when the crime involves acquaintances, intimate p artners, or family members. (A local law enfor cement action step.) 232.2 Action Step By 2008, establish a surveillance sy stem to record all firearm -related injuries and fatalities, including ty pe of firear m used, circu mstances of the shooting, relationship between the parties, and the natur e of injuries, using the Tra uma In- jury Registr y, Iowa Department of Publi c Health Vital Statistics, and data from the office of the State Medical Exam iner. Prepare an annual summary for local boards of health. (A n Iowa Department of Public Health and Iowa legisla- ture action step.) 232.3 Action Step By 2007, establish an injury prevention community advisor y group that would develop a comprehensive injur y prevention plan f or Iowa, oversee injury surveillance, and im plement community strategies for the prevention of in- tentional and unintenti onal injuries. (An Iowa Department of Public Health action step. ) 232.4 Action Step By 2007, dev elop a suicide prevention plan that will ident ify local and statewide part ners in suicide prevention, and establish specific action steps to promote indivi dual, family, comm unity , polic y, and environm ental actions to reduce sui- cide in Iowa. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health action step.) Chap ter 2 3 - Page 4 of 13 April 2005 Violent & Abusive Behavior HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision 233 Goal Statement Identify the annual rate of ph ysical abuse by current or former i ntimate partners, reduce the number of deaths from do- mestic violence to less than five annu- ally, and increase the statew ide convic- tion rate for domestic abuse cases to an average of 66 %. Baseline: Between 1990 and 19 99, an averag e of 8.7 death s resulting from dome stic violen ce occurre d each year stice/Crime V ictim Assis- tance Divisio n). Rationale The Iowa Departm ent of Public Health in- cluded three questions abo ut intim ate partner violence in it s 1999 Behav Risk Factor Sur- veillance Sy stem (BRFSS) survey . Based on t he results, the annual incidenc e of ph ysical abuse by an int imate partner in Iowa is esti mated to be 1,151 per 10 0,000. In add ition, persons with significant di sabilities were found t o be at higher risk for intim ate partner violence than the gen- eral populatio n. In 2005, questions abou t life- time exposure to intim ate partner violen ce were included in the BRFSS to provide better preva- lence data (co mpletion of f ormer action step 233.1). Between 200 0 and 2 003, an average of 12.2 deaths fro m domestic viole nce occurred each year, an incre ase fro m the previous decade. The Iowa Do mestic Abuse De ath Review Te am was established in 200 0 by legislation (com pletion of former action step 233.3). Its purpose i s to review do mestic abuse -related hom icides and suicides and make reco mmendations to comm u- nities to prevent such deaths. The Iowa Depart- ment of Publi c Health provides ad ministrative support for the team . Arrests for domesti c violence have main- tained a stead y rate of 73% since 1998, a nd ac- tually declined to 6 9% in 2001. A pilot project to profile and target repeat domestic abuse of- fenders (calle d the Protective Order Enforce- ment Team) was instituted in one count y but was never ev aluated. This project was funded with a one-time discretionary grant and could not be expanded to the rest of the state. (Former action step 23 3.2 was eli minated.) The Office of Drug Contro l Polic y (formerly the Governor 's Alliance on Substance Abuse) participated in a national e valuation of c ommu- nity coor dinat ed response teams. Efforts to ex- pand teams to other parts of the state have con- tinued as a result of communit y grants t hrough the Violence Against Women Act (co mpletion of form er action step 23 3.4). The Iowa Coalition Against Do mestic Vio- lence has had certification requirem ents for all domestic violence programs in Iowa since 2001. In 2002, the Iowa Legislat ure eli minate d the state appropriation for d omestic violence and sexual ass ault program s, but then it was mini- mally reinstated in 2004. Services to diverse populati ons expanded grea tly between 1999 and 2002 . Since 2001 , Deaf Women of Io wa Against Abuse has been funded for deaf and hard-of-hearing wom en who are victims of sex- ual or dom estic abuse. The state' s only domes- tic abuse/sex ual assault program for an exclu- sively Latina populati on w as established in the same y ear. Also, the Iowa Coalition Against Domestic Violence est ablished a speciali zed legal project for immigrant battered wo men. It received nati onal recogniti on but was eliminated in Septem ber 2004 because of federal budget cuts. Through the Integrated Services Project at the University of Northern Iowa, three pilot pro- jects to provi de cross training between substance abuse and domesti c abuse program s were im- plem ented between 1999 a nd 2003. The project has received more funding to expand to more areas of the st ate. (Refer to action step 23 1.1.) 233.1 Action Step By 2008, ens ure that funde d dom estic abuse shelters ar e in com plianc e with the Olmstead Act. (An Iowa Coalition Against Domestic Vio- lence and Iowa Depart ment of Justice/Cri me Victi m Assistance Division action step.) 233.2 Action Step By 2008, assure acce ss to dom estic violence victim advocacy for people regardless o f cultural affiliation, di sability or immigration status.

En- sure that adequate resource s for treat ment exist. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health, Iowa Depart ment of Corrections, and Iowa Coalition against Do mestic Violence action step.) 234 Goal Statement Reduce to less than 900 per 100,000 population the incidence of confirmed child abuse b y a careta ker. Baselin e, 1998, Iowa Depa rtment of Hum an Services: 1,371 cases per 1 00,000 were confirme d in the unde r aged 1 8 population. Rationale In 2003, 2,036 cases pe r 100,000 of child abuse in the u nder aged 18 populati on w ere con- firmed. Thes e num bers dramatically increas ed after 2000. D uring 1990 to 1999, the av erage number of confirmed child abuse cases in Iowa had been 9,088 annuall y, according t o the Iowa Depart ment of Hu man Ser vices. The increas es are attributed to increased referral s of children where illegal drugs were found i n their bodies. The m ost common ty pe of confirmed abuse is still denial of critical care (70.1% of all con- firmed ca ses), followed by physical injury (13.9% of all confirmed ca ses). By 2003, the Iowa Department of Hu man Services had provided 57% of its child protec- tion workers with dom estic violence training. The Depart ment adm inisters the \"Co mmunity Partnerships for Protecting Children\" pro gram, in which 37 counties participate. The effort was enhanced by the 2-y ear Family Violenc e Re- sponse Team project funde d by the Iowa De- partm ent of Justice in 13 I owa counties. 234.1 Action Step By 2007, exp and develop ment of mentor program s, respite care, and other supp ortive re- sources for parents who have young chil dren and are inexperienced, isolated from natural support systems, or at high risk for abuse.

(An Iowa Depart ment of Hum an Services, Iowa Coalition Against Domesti c Violence, and Iowa legislat ure action step.) 235 Goal Statement Identify the annual rate of sexual abuse in Iowa, increase the arrest rate fo r forci- ble rape to 16 persons per 100,000, and increase the number of sexual abuse ex- aminations in Io wa. Baseline: 6.2 per 100,00 0 in 19 97 (Iowa Unif orm Crime Report ); the Sexual Abuse Examin ation Prog ram reim- bursed 1,2 70 exams in fiscal year 199 8 (Iowa Department of Just ice/Crime Victim Assistance Division). Chap ter 2 3 - Page 6 of 13 April 2005 Violent & Abusive Behavior HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Rationale During 20 01, the Iowa Departm ent of Public Health included questions about sexual victim i- zation in its annual Behavi oral Risk Factor Sur- veillance Sy stem (BRFSS) survey . The r esults indicated that one in 10 ad ult Iowans experience sexual victimization in thei r lifetim es, a popula- tion rate of 1 0,127 per 10 0,000 persons. Sixty- five percent of those who are victi mized experi- ence it before age 18. Additional questi ons will be added to t he 2005 BRFSS; and ot her sources of surveillance (e.g., Iowa Youth Sur vey, Trau ma Information Sy stem) are being explored. The arrest rat e for forcible rape increased to 12.1 per 100 ,000 i n 2002 (Iowa Uniform Crime Report). The num ber of sexual abuse exam ina- tions billed i n FY2003 was 1,486 (Iowa De- partment of Justice/Cri me Victi m Assistance Division). Iowa co mmunity coor dinat ed response teams were evaluated as part of a nation al evaluation of Violence Against Wom en Act program s in 2001. The Crime Victim Assis- tance Division of the Iowa Department of Justice took over m anagem ent of the S.T.O.P. Violence Against Women form ula gr ants from the Office of Drug Cont rol Polic y in 2002 . The gr ants fund several s exual assault resp onse tea ms. Ap- proxim ately some form of co mmunity coord inated response teams by 2003. The International Associat ion of Forensic Nurses e stablished a national certific ation for sexual ass ault nurse exa miners (S.A.N. E.). In lieu of developing a duplic ative process, Iowa recommends that nurses who wish to specializ e in sexual assa ult exams co mplete the re quire- ments for national S.A.N.E. certification. The Iowa Coalition Against Sexual Assault implem ented certification requirem ents for all sexual assault program s in 2001 . In 2002, the legislature eli minated the s tate appropriation for domestic violence and sex ual assault programs. It was minimally reinstated in 2004. Accessibility and availability of services to diverse popul ations has not been evaluated. Since 2001, Deaf Wo men of Iowa Against Abuse has been funded f or deaf and hard-of- hearing women who are victim s of sexu al or domestic abuse. The state' s only sexual assault service for an exclusively Latina popula tion was established in the sa me year. The Iowa Departm ent of Public Health re- ceives federal funds ann ually from the Centers for Diseas e Control and Prevention for rape pre- vention an d education activities. The y are con- tracted to the Iowa Coalition Against Sexual Assault, whic h subcontracts with local programs to conduct professional education, awareness, and prevention activities. (Refer to actio n step 231.1.) 235.1 Action Step By 2007, ide ntify an annual rate of victimi- zation from sexual assault through the Behav- ioral and Risk Factor Surveillance Sy stem sur- vey.

(An I owa Depart ment of Publ ic Health action step.) 236 Goal Statement Identify the incidence of elder and de- pendent adult abuse in Io wa. Baseline: See Ration ale. Rationale In 200 3, there were 1,608 r eports of dep end- ent adult abus e to the Iowa Department of Hu- man Services, an increase of 48% from 1996. This increase is presu med to be a response to increasing aw arenes s of abuse in the population. While this may be tr ue, the Journal of t he Na- tional Aca demy of Elder Law Attorneys (Fall 2003) estim ates that 84% of elder abuse cases go unreported. Of reports made to the Iow a De- partment of Hu man Services in 2003, 359 (or 22.3%) were confirmed abuse cas es. The most common ty pes were denial or self-denial of critical care followed by exploitation. The jour- nal also esti mates that 40% of all elder abuse cases involve some for m of financial exploita- tion. In 200 1, legis lation established a state level position f or elder abuse prevention in the Iowa Department of Elder Affairs. Also, $25 5,000 was appropriated for the Elder Abuse Initiative, which focuses on prevention, intervention, de- tection, and r eporting of elder abuse, as well as neglect and exploitatio n. By 2002, four dem on- stration proje cts were established. In 2004, t he positions of e lder abuse prevention coor dinator and state elder abuse policy coordi nator were combined into one (state elder abuse sy stem co- ordinator) due to dim inished resources. Legislation was filed durin g 2002, 2003 and 2004 to m ake the dependen t adult abuse system and the Elder Abuse Initiative m ore co mprehen- sive and ensure the safety of vulnerable Iowans. This will attem pt to bridge the gap between those classifi ed legally as \"dependent adults\" and those who are elders e xperiencing abuse. This is im portant because many elders live inde- pendently and are not classified as depe ndent adults but are vulnerable to abuse or expl oita- tion, especially by family members. These dis- tinctions m ay also appl y to disabled peo ple who don't qualif y as dependent adults under I owa law but are vulnerable to exploitatio n as well. For exam ple, the 1999 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sy stem survey showed that people with disabiliti es reported phy sical abuse by an intim ate partner at a higher rate than the general populati on. After 2001, s everal changes were made to Iowa law to facilitate the partnership between the Iowa Dep artment of Human Services and the Iowa Department of Elder Affairs. The changes removed barriers to provid ing help to elders who experience ab use, neglect or exploitation. The Iowa Department of Elder Affairs estab lished a \"Train the Trainer Certification\" for people in- terested in conducting mandatory report er train- ing for depen dent adult ab use and who use the Iowa Depart ment of Elder Affairs curri culum . To date, abou t 300 people have been certified. Triad is a non -funded pr oject that encour- ages seniors, senior advocates, and law e n- forcem ent officials to work together locally to protect seniors fro m crime. The Triad State Ad- visor y Council gave presentations at the 2003 and 200 4 Eld er Rights Con ference on the bene- fits of establishing such gr oups. T hey are hard to start in communities be cause they are not funded and law enforcement bu dgets, li ke many others, have been drasticall y cut in recent years. It is difficult f or local law enforcem ent to find the time and staff to attend meetings, let alone begin a Triad in their comm unity . The State Advisor y Council is worki ng to recruit more members and develop goals, action steps, and timelines for activities. (R efer to action steps 233.1 and 235.4.) 236.1 Action Step By 2007, increase the level of funding for dependent ad ult and elder abuse services and increase the p ercentage of r eported cases where services are o ffered, regardless of whether or not the case s prove to be founded. (An Iow a De- partment of Hu man Services and Iowa legisla- ture action step.) Chap ter 2 3 - Page 8 of 13 April 2005 Violent & Abusive Behavior HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision 236.2 Action Step By 2009, app ly a m ore consistent interpreta- tion to the def inition of \"dependent adult \" and increase the p ercentage of dependent adult abuse cases that are founded. (An Iowa Depart ment of Human Services, Iowa D epartment of Inspec- tions and Ap peals, and Iowa Department of Jus- tice action ste p.) 236.3 Action Step By 2009, incr ease the nu mber of countie s that participate in Triad. ( An Iowa Dep artment of Elder Affairs, Iowa Dep artment of Justice, Iowa Department of Publi c Safety , and local law enforce ment agencies a ction step.) 237 Goal Statement Establish procedures at 100 % of hospital emergenc y departments, famil y planning agencies, public health clinics, co mmu- nity mental health centers, and sub- stance abuse treatment program s for routinel y identify ing, treating and prop- erly refe rring victims of child abuse, do- mestic abuse, elder abuse, and sexual assault. Baseline, 1997, Iowa Depa rtment of Public Health : 74% of Iowa emergen cy depa rt- ments ha d protocol s for id entifying dom estic abuse. Rationale In 200 2, the Iowa Department of Publ ic Health surveyed Iowa hospitals and lear ned that 33% of emergency departments had imple- mented policies for routine screening for dom es- tic abuse. In 2003 , the Departm ent conducted regional training sessions for hospitals and pub- lic health clinics (m aternal/ child health, f amily planning, and WIC) to im prove the health care response to d omestic violence. This was funded throug h a gra nt that the Departm ent received from the Family Violence Prevention F und be- tween 2000 a nd 2003. Materials with stronger guidance for responding to dom estic abuse in adult, pediatri c and public health settings were also developed and distributed across the state. Recent re search strengthened the link be- tween adverse childhood experiences an d chronic health conditi ons. Abuse often occurs across a per son's lifespan, so it is im portant to integrate the issues of child abuse, dom estic abuse, sexual assault, and e lder abuse into broader training for health care providers. Pro- fessional trai ning has expanded acade mic and clinical curric ula to address these needs. Other co mmunity professionals, such as clergy , scho ol personnel, and youth serv ice workers, need to be i ncluded in this trai ning. In addition, more information about special pop ula- tions, includi ng persons wi th disabilities or spe- cific cultural groups, needs to be integrat ed into it. Expanding comm unity capacity to identify and respond t o victim s of abuse can decr ease isolation and further educate the public o n the impact of violence and abuse on indiv iduals, families and co mmunities. 237.1 Action Step By 2007, dev elop and p ost to the Iowa De- partm ent of Public Health web site a variety of training and technical as sistance resourc es for public health providers on routine identi fication of, and appr opriate intervention with , victims of child abuse, domestic abus e, elder abuse , and sexual assault.

Baselin e: See Ration ale. Rationale No specific a gency has taken leadership to address workplace violence since this goal was established in Healthy Iowans 20 10. Regarding school violence, the Iowa De- partment of Education has for several y ears been working on bullying in scho ols. In 2004, th e Governor intr oduced legisl ation to promote an anti-bull ying initiative. The Depart ment posted model anti-bullying policie s for schools on its web site and is planning a c onference and train- the-trainer for area educatio nal agencies i n 2005. They are also considering i ncluding addi tional questions on the Iowa Youth Surve y to identify how extensiv e the problem is in schools in Iowa. A disaster an d response pl an was devel oped for Iowa thro ugh t he efforts of the Iowa De- partm ent of Public Defense/Division of Home- land Securit y and Em ergency Management, the Iowa Department of Publi c Health, the Iowa Depart ment of Justice, and the Red Cross. The plan was largely initiated f ollowing t he Septem - ber 11, 2 001, terrorist attack on t he Worl d Trade Center, but crisis response teams have been de- ployed for na tural disasters as well. 238.1 Action Step By 2007, ide ntify funding and staff to track the num ber and t ypes of in tentional vio lent inci- dents in schools and workplaces. (An I owa leg- islature, Iowa Department of Education, and Workforce Development action step.) 238.2 Action Step By 2009, establish a state level task force on school and w orkplace viol ence that will review data, identif y model policies, and develop cur- ricula and training m aterials for em ployee and supervisor y training pr ograms.

Baseli ne: See Ration ale. Rationale In January 19 99, the I owa Collaborative for Youth Developm ent (ICY D) was establ ished as an interagency initiative to discuss y outh devel- opment, build consensus on a youth develop- ment framework, and promote use of youth de- velopm ent principles. Its three broad ob jectives are to: 1. Better coordinate and align state policies and program s on youth, using a positive youth de- velopm ent framework; Chap ter 2 3 - Page 10 of 1 3 April 2005 Violent & Abusive Behavior HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision 2. Identify or develop resources for use in communities to prom ote youth develop ment and facilitate plan ning and im plem entation of effec- tive youth developm ent programs; and Increas e youth involvem ent in state and lo- cal policy discussions and decision-m aking. The activities of the ICYD have addressed several of the action steps that were initially es- tablished und er Goal 23 9. In 200 4, the Iowa Department of Publ ic Health initiated a project to enhance Iowa's ca- pacity to address risk and protective fact ors in youth violenc e throug h public health strategies. The project works closely with the ICYD to as- sess current data, policies a nd programs in this area. By 2006, a strategic plan to addre ss gaps in these areas will be com plete. The Iowa De- partm ent of Public Health and its communit y partners expect to have m ore impact add ressing all forms of youth violence (e.g., suicide, hom i- cide, dating v iolence) by d eveloping sol utions based on a social ecologica l model, whic h in- cludes interventions at vari ous levels: in divid- ual, community, providers, coalitions and net- works, organizational practices, and policy and legislation. 239.1 Action Step By 2005, produce a \"report card\" on Io wa's capacity to address the risk and protective fac- tors in youth violence in Io wa. (An Iowa De- partm ent of Public Health action step.) 239.2 Action Step By 2008, ide ntify soluti ons at the level of indivi dual, co mmunity , providers, organi za- tional, and policy arenas to reduce y outh vio- lence in co mmunities, and integrate youth de- velopm ent principles into I owa Department of Public Health violence prevention strategies.

Vision is an essential part of every day life. Peo- ple of all ages continuall y depend on it . It af- fects development, learning, comm unicating, working, health, and t he quality of life. Many people do not give visio n a second thou ght and take for grant ed how heavi ly the y rely on their vision in everyda y living. According to the Lighth ouse National Sur- vey on Visio n Loss (199 5), 24% of peo ple with impaired vision age 45 an d older report t hat a vision proble m caused at least so me difficulty managing daily ho usehold tasks. Anoth er 18% reported some difficulty getting to places outside the hom e because of their vision pr oblems, and 38% reported at least so me interference with their leisure activities. Visual im pairment is one of the four m ost significant contribut ors to the loss of indepe ndence am ong older Am ericans. Vision im pairment, as defined in Iowa, i s vision that is less than 20/40 in the better ey e with corrective lenses. The definition of legal blindness, as defined by the Social Secu rity Administration, is visual acuity , with best cor- rection in the better ey e, worse than or equal to 20/200 or a visual field ex tent of 20 or less de- grees in dia meter. A refractive error occu rs when the e ye does not focus pr operly due to myopia (near- sightedness) or hy peropia h the e xact cause of many refractive errors remains unknown, a common risk factor is he- redity. Other environm ental risk factors, includ- ing nutrition, can affect the developm ent of re- fractive error s. Undiagnosed cases can c ause problems f or children and adults. Many refractive err ors can be effectively treated with prescription ey e- glasses or co ntact lenses p rescribed by an ey e- care professio nal. It can also som etimes be treated with s urgical procedures such as LASIK eye surgery . Precautions m ust be taken when considering cos metic surge ry because of strict criteria for beco ming a candidate and many po- tential risks. The num ber of Americans at risk for age- related ey e diseas es is incr easing as the baby - boom er generation ages. The num ber of Am eri- cans with age-related ey e disease and resulting vision im pairment is expected to do uble within the next three decades. According to the April 2004 issue of Ar- chives in Ophthalm ology , the leading causes of vision im pairment in the United States, in order, are: Catara cts Glauco ma Macular Deg eneration Diabetic Retinopath y A cataract is a clouding of the ey e's lens. It can result from eye injurie s, lifeti me exposure to ultraviolet radiation, or age-related chemical changes. Cat aracts affect an estimated 2 0.5 lion ng an estim ated 257, and ol der. This is appro ximately one in six people in this age range. Glaucoma is an ey e disease that causes pro- gressive optic nerve damage that, if left un- treated, leads to blindness. At least half of the people who have glaucoma are not recei ving treatment because they are unaware of their con- dition. Glaucoma affects more than 2.2 m illion Americans, including an estim ated 24,543 Io- wans age 40 and older. T his is about 1 .9% of this pop ulatio n. In general, glaucom a is m ore April 2005 Chap ter 2 4 Page 1 of 8 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Visio n common in African A mericans, Hispanic s and with increasi ng age. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a condition that primarily affects the part of the retina responsible for sharp central vision. Be- sides being a leading cause of blindness in the United States, AMD is a leading cause of poor vision. AMD affects over 1.6 m illion Ameri- cans, including an esti mated 23,841 Iowans. Diabetic retinopathy is a common co mplica- tion of diabetes. It affect s the tiny blood vessels of the retina. In general, th e longer a person has diabetes, the greater the ris k of developing dia- betic retinopathy . It affects about 5.3 m illion Americans ag e 18 and older, including a n esti- mated 57,231 Iowans. Dia betes also inc reases the risk of other ey e disease s, such as cat aracts and glaucom a. Because it e ndangers good vi- sion, people with diabetes are urged to receive annual dilated ey e exam s. Eye injury is a leading cause of monocular blindness in t he United States, and is second only to catara cts as the most common ca use of visual im pairment. Major causes of ey e injuries are blunt obje cts (31% ), sharp (18% ), and m otor vehicle crashe s (9%). The remainder are caused by bb/pellet g uns (6% ), nails (5% ), hammer on falls (4%), and oth er (8% ) (2000 U.S. E ye Injury Registry ). Currently, over 1 m illion Am ericans over 40 are blind. They are am ong 3.3 m illion who suf- fer fro m some sort of vision loss, and the num - bers are projected to reach 5.5 m illion by 2020. According the Prevent Blindness Iowa, this equates to 15, 682 Iowans i n this age de mo- graphic who are legally blind. In 1981, the eco- nomic impact of visual dis orders and di sabilities was approximately $14. 1 billion. By 1995, this figure was estimated to have risen to m ore than $38.4 m illion, i ncludi ng $22.3 billi on in direct costs and $16.1 billion in indirect costs each y ear, according to the Na- tional Adviso ry Eye Counc il in 1 998. The trend has continued to rise and with the advent of the baby -boom er generation; these nu mbers are pre- dicted to continue to increa se. The Healthy Iowans 2010 Vision Chapter is based on the national Healthy People 2010 Vi-sion Chapter. The goals and action steps have been expanded to fit I owa's dem ographics. One of the m ost important goals of this chapt er is to collect vision data specific to Iowa beca use there is no reposito ry for such in formation. T he prob- lem areas in I owa must be identified before they can be addres sed. Som e data has been e xtrapo- lated from national data or calculated by using synthetic estimates. Othe r data were su pplied b y the Depart ment for the Blind, Prevent Blindness Iowa, the Departm ent of Education, and local optom etrists and ophthalmologists. Prevent Blindness A merica and The Na- tional E ye Ins titute's \" Vision Problems in the U.S.\" publication sa ys that at 3.7%, Iowa has the second highe st prevalence of vision im pairm ent and blindness in the United States for persons age 40 and older. Iowa als o has a large elderly populati on. I t follows the national trend with African A mericans, Hispan ics and the elderly having t he highest rates of visual im pairments. National studies show that African A mericans are twice as li kely to be visually im paired as whites of com parable socioeconom ics status. Compared to Caucasi ans, Hispanics ha ve three times the risk of developing ty pe 2 diabetes. Nationally , more than 2/3 of visuall y impaired adults are over age 65. More attention needs to be given to visio n problem s in I owa's children. Vision is used at crucial devel opmental st ages in children to learn and read. In f act, 80% of all learning dur ing a child' s first 12 years co mes through vision. Remedies exi st to either correct vision loss or develop effective non- visual techniques to en- sure that nor mal learning and develop ment are not im peded. Unfortunately, m any children do not receive a vision screening until t hey enter school. For many , this is too late. Half of all childre n with amblyopia (lazy eye) are diagnosed after the age of five when t reatment may be m ore difficult and less effe ctive. Vision problem s in c hildren can also caus e developm ental delay s. It is esti- mated that as many as 9,000 children in Iowa under the age of four suffer from poor vi sion in at least one e ye. Education is the first step in the awarene ss of vision health. Stream lining resources and the networking of agencies in the state is als o a step Chap ter 2 4 Page 2 of 8 April 2005 Vision HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision in the righ t direction. Comm on action is im por- tant because many great resources in Iowa can help with visi on screenings, rehabilitation and education. Iowa has vision screenings in schools but t he process is n ot standardized. It is important that m ore specifi c state wide st andards for vision car e be adopted. Resources have been brought together from Prev ent Blindness Iowa, the Iowa Dep artment for the Blind, the I owa Department of Education, t he Iowa Departm ent of Public Health, Proteus, the University of Iowa, Iowa O ptometric Association, Coming To Your Senses, and Ke min Health. Education and rehabilitation are i mportant parts of the continuum of services avail able to people with serious and progressive ey e disease s or disorders. While best efforts can be made to prom ote prev ention, som e impairments cannot be prevented. Loss of inde pendence and mean- ingful em ployment are real fears for anyone who is beginnin g to struggle wit h severe vision loss. Rehabilitation can be used to help peopl e de- velop skills a nd gain the confidence necessary to lead active, independent, an d prod uctive l ives as contributi ng mem bers of fam ily, work, and the community . It is essential that the public develop a greater awareness of the benefit and availability of rehabilitation for people who are blind or visually im paired. This will ensure for all Io- wans that: 1) people w ho need rehabilitation will be referred for them and 2) once people receive the services n eeded to participate in society , doors to ed ucation, em ployment and ind epend- ence open to t hem consistent with the mandates of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Olmstead Act . According to national data collected by Lightho use National Surve y on Vision Loss (1995), when asked why vision rehabilit ation was not used many respon dents reported being unfam iliar wi th its availabilit y. The y did not know that lo w vision clini cal services were available, as well as re creational services, reha- bilitation trai ning on g/placement. Approxim ately 35% of middle-aged or older adult s did not know if there were lo cal public or private agencies that provide vision rehabilitation. Prom otion of qualit y eye care should be e m- phasized. Iowans need to understand th at early intervention a nd regular e ye exa ms are i mpor- tant in m aintaining good vision. Between 40% and 50% of all blindness ca n be prevente d if effectively treated, resulting in the restoration of sight. Ed ucation for t hose at high risk of eye disease and those who are visually im paired are essential for c urrent and future visual independ- ence. The vision chapter is a plan to m ove Iowa toward a better state of vision health. T he goals and action steps are meant to im prove aw arenes s and prom ote prevention, re habilitation a nd treatment of vision im pairments. Goal Statements & Action Steps 241 Goal Statement Establish a reliable Io wa-specific base- line on visi on. Rationale In atte mpting to address vision problems, it was extre mely difficult to find baseline data spe- cific to Iowa. Bits and pieces of state-sp ecific inform ation a re currently available, but there is no com prehensive or complete source of data. Current data has been extrapolated from national data or has been calculated using s ynthetic esti- mates. It is im portant to understand exactly what the proble m areas ar e in Iowa before ad- dressing them. Since the goals and action steps in this chapter are developmental, Iowa- specific data will allow a better understanding of what is occurring in the state and where the cha pter fo- cus needs to be. 241.1 Action Step By 2006, create a repository for Iowa- specific vision data by using responses from the Iowa Behavioral Risk Fact or Surveillance Sy s- tem survey . (An Iowa Dep artment of Public Health action step.) 241.2 Action Step By 2006, use such data to edit the vision chapter goals if needed, and contin ue to include April 2005 Chap ter 2 4 Page 3 of 8 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Visio n vision questions in the survey so data can be current. (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health action step.) 241.3 Action Step By 2007, make available to the pu blic t he Iowa-specifi c data collected. (An Iowa Depart- ment of Publi c Health step.) 242 Goal Statement Build aw areness of the importance of early interv ention and rehabilitation to increase positive outcomes for adults who are visuall y impaired or blind. Base- line: See Rati onale. Rationale Rese arch has shown the effectiveness of early intervention for at-ris k children (those with visual im pairments). It improves educational outcom es that result in positive adult outco mes. Children with visual im pairments must receive qualit y rehabi litation from highl y qualifi ed and specialized teachers and orientation and mobility specialist s to reach ac ademic co mpetenc y and the abilit y to travel independentl y. The Iowa De partment for the Blind has es- timated that as many as 58, 000 Iowans o ver the age of 40 are blind or visua lly im paired. Yet, the department as the primary provider - and in much of Iowa the sole provider - of reha bilita- tion for blind persons or th ose who are visually impaired has records of just over 14 ,000 people, and it gets an average of 1,000 referrals annu- ally. This str ongly suggest s that the rate of re- ferral for rehabilitation, which im pacts p ositive adult outcom es, needs to be increas ed. 242.1 Action Step By July 2006, build at least one partnership with service providers, m edical provider s, con- sumer groups, and educational institutions. (An Department of Education a nd Iowa Departm ent for the Blind action step.) 242.2 Action Step By July 2005, develop and implement a strategy to m arket service s of potential visually impaired e mployees to Iowa e mployers. (An Iowa Department for the Blind action s tep.) 242.3 Action Step By July 2006, develop and conduct sem inars on assistive technology for and adv anced technolog y us- ers. (An Iowa Depart ment for the Blind action step.) 243 Goal Statement Develop new or impro ved educational programs to reduce visual disabil ities due to lo w birth w eight or premature births. Baseline: See Ra tionale. Rationale The national Model Registry of Earl y Child- hood Visual Im pairment (Hatton, 200 2) reports that the diagnosis of Cortical Visual I mpairment (CVI) and Retinopath y of Prem aturity (ROP) are the two leading causes of visual im pairment in the United St ates and Canada. In additi sual Im pairment Reg- istry found that the same is true in Iowa. Thirt y- six percent of the newly id entified babies with visual im pairments have been diagnosed with CVI, with ROP the second leading cau se. Also, Iowa's Early Childho od Vi sual Im pairment Reg- istry found that the mean birth weight of females was 73 ounces and for m ales 86 ounces. Fe- male s had a mean of 32 weeks gestatio nal age. Recognizing t he importance of early educa- tion for pregn ant women or women who may beco me preg nant, this goal strives to educate the public o n some of the indi cators and predictors of premature births or low birth weight babies. The March of Dim es is in the second year of a 5- year grant c ycle to reduce pre mature bir ths in Iowa. 243.1 Action Step By 2007, assist in creating ongoi ng colla bo- rative partnerships with the March of Dimes, other health-care providers, the Iowa Depart- ment of Publi c Health, co mmunity groups, and educational sites. The partnerships will provide educational material on th e indicators and risk Chap ter 2 4 Page 4 of 8 April 2005 Vision HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision factors for prem ature births and low birt h weight babies, which could include the negative effects of drinking al cohol and poor prenatal nutrition. (A March of Di mes action step.) 243.2 Action Step By 2007, hel p develop an ongoi ng colla bo- ration with medical providers to ensure that ex- pecting m others rec eive materials on prenatal and nutriti onal importance. (An Iowa Depart- ment of Publi c Health actio n step.) 244 Goal Statement Build aw areness in Iow a of the i mpor- tance of maintaining good e ye health through prevention and education. Base- line: See Rati onale. Rationale Many eye disease s and disorders have no symptoms or early warning signs and can be more prevale nt in certain ethnic groups, ages and genders. Regular visits to an e ye-care pro- fessional (optometrist or ophthalm ologist) early diagnosis, pre ven- tion and treatment, which can significantly re- duce visual im pairment. They are also opportu- nities to increase patients' awar eness of the im - portance of ey e health. Minim um eye exam inatio n frequenc y for people with t he following vision-threatening conditions is: Macular Glauco ma*........................Every 6 months *These are guidelines on ly, ag reed upon by the Iowa Optometric Asso ciation and the Iowa Acad emy of Ophthalmology. Peop le with th ese con ditions should receive routine eye examinati ons from an ey e-care professional. The frequ ency of examina tions will b e determined by the provider. 244.1 Action Step By 2006, address the vision disparit y among age, gender and ethnicit y. (A Proteus, Iowa De- partm ent of Public Hea lth and Department of Human Rights action step.) 244.2 Action Step Through 2010, continue to provide acce ss to eye care through free screenings at health fairs, among em ployer groups, at senior centers, child- care c enters, and public health venues such as WIC Clinics and Head Start Programs. (An in- dividual optometrists and ophthalm ologists, Coming To Y our Senses, Prevent Blindness Iowa, Iowa O ptometric Association, Area Edu- cation Agencies and the Iowa Ac ademy of Oph- thalm ology action step.) 244.3 Action h 2010, contin ue to educate the pub- lic about pro grams for low-income, unin sured Iowans such as Vision US metric A ssoci ation, hawk-i EyeCare A merica, and Prevent Blindness Iowa/VSP through Si ght For Students action step.) 244.4 Action Step By 2008, communicate r esearch-ba sed in- formation to key players (e.g., pediatricians, family-practice phy sicians, and other health-care providers) to encourage standardized pro cedures for screening and referral of vision con ditions. (An Iowa Optometric As sociation, Iowa Acad- emy of Ophthal mology , Coming to Your Senses, Iowa Medical Society , Iowa Chapter of the American Ac ademy of Pediatrics, and the Iowa Academ y of Fam ily Physicians action step.) 244.5 Action Step By 2007, dev elop and im plem ent a Diabetes Eye Exam Report to enhance co mmunication between pri mary care phy sicians and eye-car e providers, resulting i n improved patient care. (An Iowa Optometric As sociation, Iowa Acad- emy of Opht halmology, and local health-care systems actio n step.) 244.6 Action Step By 2010, collaborate with the Healthy Io- wans 2010 Di abetes Chapter to work tow ard its goal of 80% of persons with diabetes receiving an annual dil ated exam ination.

(A Healthy Iowans 201 0 Vision Chapter Tea m actio n step.) 245 Goal Statement Increase the number of preschool chil- dren (aged 5 and under) w ho rece ive vi- sion screenings and appropriate follo w- up care as determined b y an e ye-care professional. School-aged children (K- 12) are also encouraged to receive e ye examinations and appropriate follow -up care. Baseli ne: See Ratio nale. Rationale One ele mentary school child in four has an undetected vi sion problem . Early recognition i n school-aged children result s in m ore effective treatment that can be sight-saving or eve n life- saving. Recognizing t he importance of vision in learning, it is recommende d that childre n 5 years and younger, who do not s how signs of visual defects, re ceive a scientific ally validated vision screening (proven to detect norm al vision versus abnorm al eye conditions) t o rule out undetected vision pr oblems. If vision problem are sus- pected for persons of any age, the y should re- ceive a co mprehensive ey e exa mination from an eye-care professional. 245.1 Action Step By 2007, bri ng together ke y pla yers (e.g., pediatricians, fa mily-practice phy sicians, and other health-care providers) to discuss standard- ized procedures for vision screening and referral of vision co nditions. (An Iowa Opto metric As- sociation and the Iowa Academ y of Op hthal- mology action step.) 245.2 Action Step By 2007, to s tandardize protocol, i dentify the m ost effective delivery and use of vision as- sessment in c hildren ages 18 and younger. (An Iowa Opto metric Associ ation, the Iowa Acad- emy of Opht halmology, and the Iowa Depart- ment of Education action step.) 245.3 Action Step By 2007, establish baseline data on the number of children currently receiving appropri- ate follow-up care aft er a failed vision s creening and track that num ber. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health, area education agencies, school nurses, Co ming To Your Senses, and Prevent Blindness Iowa action ste p.) 245.4 Action Step By 2005, edu cate new mothers on infant vision with look for\" checklist dis- tributed thr ough the Iowa Hospital WIC Clinics. (An Iowa Opto metric Asso- ciation, Iowa Hospital Association, WI C, Iowa Ophthalm ology, Col- lege of Obstetrics and Gy necology action step.) 246 Goal Statement Encourage Iowa health insurance carri- ers and emplo yer grou ps to include vi- sion benefits in their policies b y discuss- ing their importance and advantages. Baselin e: See Ration ale. Rationale Many insurance co mpanies in Iowa offer vision benefit s, but as an add-on option for bene- fit packages a nd not as a core standard. There- fore, many insured Iowans do n ot have v ision benefits. This can affe ct how often the y receive eye exam inations. By cove ring regularly sched- uled e ye examinations, which can catc h potential visual im pairments early on, insurers would not only help in t reatment, but potentiall y lower the health-care c osts of late stage diseas e treat ment. 246.1 Action Step By April 2005, develop baseline data of cur- rent ey e-care benefits. What was the sit uation 10 years ago? How many policies cover vision as a standard benefit? How many include vision as an add-on benefit? Wh at vision bene fits are offered? (A 201 0 Vision Coali- tion action st ep.) Chap ter 2 4 Page 6 of 8 April 2005 Vision HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision 246.2 Action Step By July 2005, write a position paper to be distributed to Iowa h ealth-insurance co mpanies that explains the current state of vision in Iowa and the benef its of includi ng vision as a core benefit. (A Healthy Iowans 201 0 Vision Coali- tion action st ep.) 246.3 Action Step Throug h 2010, annuall y monitor dialog with the insurance industr y, employers and un ions on changes in vision policies, if any. Educate their mem bers on benefits. (A Healthy Iowans Vision Chapter Tea m action step.) 247 Goal Statement Educate Iow ans on th e benefits of certi- fied e ye protection when engaged in po- tentiall y hazardous activities that have chemical, ph ysical or radiation agents. It should be used at home, in recreation or at work. Baseline: See Rationale. Rationale According to Prevent Blindness A merica, 90% of all eye injuries can be prevented. Many construction unions, occu pations engagi ng in hazardous act ivities, and contractors already re- quire protective ey e wear for all workers. While many eye injuries are occu pation-related, such as in construction or agriculture, the m ajority occur during recreation or at hom e. In sports such as tennis, racquetball or baseball, balls can hit the e ye with enough force to cause re tinal detach ment or crush an ey eball and cause blind- ness. This could be prevented by encouraging and educating coaches and parents on the use of protective eye equipm ent. Many eye injuries occur in a hom e work- shop or while engaging i n home improvement. Workshop grinders, drills and saws are am ong those m ost often causing ey e injuries. Also, caustic che micals used for cleaning, painting or polishin g cause a significant num ber of such injuries. Lawn equipm ent, such as mowers or weed eat ers, can throw pebbles or sticks with enough f orce to injure an e ye. Injuries can occur not onl y to the person working with the tool or ch emical, but also to \"helpers\" by flying debris and particles or chem icals. Im proper use of nail gu ns, table saws or w elding equipm ent can also injure an eye. Other hazardous acti vities include firing bb/pellet gu ns and im proper handling of fire- works. Even vehicle cr ashes can c ause eye inju- ries. Wearin g safety eye wear manufa ctured to industr y standards can prevent m ost eye injuries. Everyone should take e ye-safety precautions. 247.1 Action Step By 2005, dete rmine the num ber and causes of ey e injurie s in Iowa that are treated in hospi- tals, e mergency room s, and by health-care pro- fessionals. ( An Iowa Dep artment of Public Health action step.) 247.2 Action Step By 2005, dete rmine the sco pe of safety edu- lawn- and sho p-equipm ent manufac- turers, the me dia and government agencies. (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health and Exten- sion Services action step.) 247.3 Action Step By 2005, dete rmine the sco pe of safety edu- cation provided to consumers by busine sses sell- ing g uns, b b guns, and pellet guns.

Public health and he alth care ar e making significant progress in building capacity in preparedness for and response to bioterroris m, infe ctious disease outbreaks, an d other p ublic health threats and emergencies, includin g the following: 1) preparedness plans and strategies have been develop ed; 2) new planni ng, epidem iological, and la bo- 3) new em ergency comm unication capabili- ties have been im plemented; 4) and training of the workfor ce is ongoi ng; an d 5) equipm ent and supplies have been pu r- chased. The challenges for public health and he alth care prepar edness and resp onse vary greatly from state to state and jurisdiction to jurisdic- tion. What is m ost importa nt is that a statewide, effective and sustainable public health and health care \"system\" of emergency preparedness and response capable of providing services across organizational boun daries is developed, implem ented and m aintain ed for all Iowans. As public health and health care move to - ward the next phase of progress in developm ent of a strong ef fective prepar edness and response \"syste m\" in Iowa, considerations m ust be given to the foll owing challenges to ensure that the goals and action steps of this chapter wil l be met: 1. Fundin g for public health i nfrastructure de- velopm ent an d maintenance must be further de- veloped and s ustained over the long term. 2. Terroris m preparedness must not be funded at the expense of other critical public health pro- gram s and priorit y health c are activities, or for filling state budget shortfal ls. 3. Workforce issues must be addressed on all levels, including the h igh number of expected retirements in public hea lth, enhancing tr aining, and accessibility for training to public he alth and health care professionals; a nd we m ust address the volu nteer issues surrounding our emergency medical s ervice sy stem. 4. Collaboration and coordi nation am ong h os- pitals, e mergency medical services, outpatient clinics, poiso n control cent ers, and substance abuse and me ntal health syste ms must be given the highest pr iority. 5. Iowa' s public health and he alth care prepar- edness and response sy stem must be \"tested\" and evaluated through re gularly schedule d drills and exercises docum enting weakness es and de- veloping corrective action plans. Best practice s from actual incidents shou ld be shared with pub- lic health and health care partners to im prove the system as a whole. 6. A system evaluation and quality improve- ment program needs to be established by the Preparedness Advisory Committee to ensure efficient and effective a chieve ment of s ystem goals and objectives, as well as achieve ment of the goals and action steps outlines in this chap- ter. In line with t he existing emergency man- agement field , public health preparedness and response must encom pass an all-hazards ap- proach integr ating ut also chem ical, radio- April 2005 Chap ter 2 5 Page 1 of 10 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Emergency Preparedness & Response logical and mass trau ma that threatens t he pub- lic's health whether these incidents are naturally occurring, accidental or terrorist induced.

Baseli ne: Un known numbe r of de dicate d local public health staff; 24 dedicated public health regional staff; 12 dedicated healt h care regional staff; 22.5 state staff. Source: 200 4 Prepa redness Co - operative Agreement Appli cation. Rationale A systematic approach to leadership, direc- tion and coordination is im perative for success - ful preparedness and respo nse sy stem develop- ment. The Iowa Department of Pu blic Health shall serve in a leadership c apacity for the Public Health and Health Care Pr eparedness Pr ogram . The Preparedness Advisory Committee should actively parti cipate in the developm ent and im - plem entation of local, regio nal and state public health preparedness and health care resp onse planning . The committee should serve to advise the Depart ment in addressing preparedness and response issu es, funding al locations for person- nel and other activities, communication and pol- icy, and proc edure development and implem en- tation. To appropriat ely respon d to a public health emergency , there must be trained public health and health care professionals available t o re- spond at the l ocal, regional and state level. Pub- lic health and health care w orkforce continues to decline at a ra pid rate due to a num ber of issues. The declining num bers of public health p rofes-sionals, and the increasing educational and com - petency dem ands on t he workforce, along with regular dail y programmatic responsibilities at the count y level, makes it imperative to grow the current infrastructure at the count y, regio nal and state level. At the state and coun ty level, a num ber of responsibiliti es were added to the curre nt work- force rather t han hiring additional staff. At the state and regional level, m inimal staff was hired that increased the infrastructure, but not to an acceptable l evel that m eets the needs and de- mands. Maintaining or increasing publi c health and health care infrastruct ure is a key compo- nent to respo nd to a public health em ergency and/or o utbreak. 251.1 Action Step Throug h 2010, annuall y allocate resources, includin g personnel, to ach ieve goals and objec- tives, im plement work plan s, and m onitor pro- gress for Iowa' s publ ic health and health care emergency preparedness an d response system at the local, regional and state level. (An Iowa De- partm ent of Public Health action step.) 251.2 Action Step Throug h 2010, ever y other year review the Preparedness Advisory Committee structure (in- cluding m embership) and process to advise the state department of pu blic health regarding ac- tivities of the United States Depart ment of Health and Human Service' s (Centers for Dis- ease Control and Prevention) CDC and (Health Resources and Services A dministration ) HRSA Cooperative Agreements and ot her em ergency preparedness and response activities.

Chap ter 2 5 Page 2 of 10 April 2005 Emergency Preparedness & Response HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision 251.4 Action Step Throug h 2010, annuall y review that staffing levels at the local, regional and state that sup- ports preparedness activities. This review may be used to assist local, regional and state public health in allo cating funds f or personnel. (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health, local public health agencies, and hospitals action ste p.) 252 Goal Statement At least every three years, conduct a comprehensive needs assessment of public health, laboratories, and health care emergenc y prepa redness and re- sponse to determine areas of improve- ment and capacities related to all haz- ards (biological, chemical, radiological, mass trauma) and other public health threats and emergencies. Baseline: Firs t asse ssment sche duled for De cemb er 2004, 2007, 20 10. Rationale Current information is nec essary to ensure that existing public health and health care sy s- tems are prepared to cope with potential disease outbreaks and other pu blic health threats and emergenci es. Updated data collected from needs assessments f orm the basi s to effectively im- prove count y, regional and state response plans. 252.1 Action Step Through 2010, coordinate asse ssments, as necessary , with other assessm ents conducted by other discipli nes to avoid duplication of effort when appropr iate. (An Iowa Department of Public Health action step.) 252.2 Action Step Through 2010, at least eve ry three years conduct comprehensive analy sis of inf ormation and data obta ined duri ng needs assessments. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health action step.) 252.3 Action Step Through 2010, at least eve ry three years docum ent the findings and corrective act ions to be taken and establish tim elines, goals and o b- jectives for achieving and refining coop erative agreement requirements. (An Iowa Dep artment of Public Health, hospitals, laboratories, Univer- sity Hygienic Laborator y, and local pub lic health agencies a ction step) 253 Goal Statement Enhance disaster preparedness plans in each county and at the state level to in- clude an all -hazards approach using the National Incident Management Sy stem (NIMS) to e nsure that the needs of spe- cial populations are met, and develop six public health regional disaster prepared- ness plans to ensure that Io wa is pre- pared to respond to public health threats and emergencies b y terrorism, n atural disasters and infectious diseases out- breaks. Baselin e: 99 co unty plans; 1 state plan; 0 plan s. 20 04 CDC g rant outcom e data . Rationale The purpose of pub lic health and health care emergency preparedness an d response pl ans is to describe how local and state officials wil l man- age and coordinate an em ergency respo nse. Re- gional response plans made prior to the enact- ment of state level assist ance are an esse ntial component of response preparation to assure that local health care and publi c health has hands-on assist ance in the early hours of an e mergency or large outbreak. The plan also serves as a written basis for agreement am ong all parties with significant statutory and/ or contractual responsibilit y to take action in the event of such an emergency and identifies e mergency response organizations, facilities, and other resources that can be utilized during an emergency . The ultim ate objectives of the response efforts in a plan are to minim ize morbidity and m ortality resulting from bio- emergenci es, infectious disease outbreak s, and other pu blic h ealth threats and em ergencies to April 2005 Chap ter 2 5 Page 3 of 10 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Emergency Preparedness & Response maintain publ ic health, health care, and o ther essential co mmunity services. 253.1 Action Step Through 2010, at least eve ry two years re- view and update sc alable plans that support lo- cal, regional and statewide response to incidents of bio-em ergencies; natura l disasters; c as sm allpox, pan- demic influenza, SARS, an d other infect ious disease outbreaks; and other public health threats and emergencies. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health, local public health agencies, Iowa Ho meland Securit y and Em ergency Man- agement and hospitals action step.) 253.2 Action Step By 2007 and annuall y thereafter, enhan ce count y, regional and state plans to accommodate the operational and phy sical needs of special populati ons such as people with disabilit ies, pregnant wo men, children, the elderl y, and those with special health care nee ds. (An Iowa De- partment of Public Health, local public health agencies, and hospitals action step.) 253.3 Action Step By 2010, dev elop or enhan ce plans and pro- tocols that address: (a) Clinical specimen transport and handli ng, (b) Worker safet y, (c) Appropriate Bio-Safety Level (BSL) condi- tions for working with clinical speci mens, (d) Staffing and t raining of personnel, (e) Quality control and assurance, (f) Internal and external proficiency testing, (g) Triage procedures for priori tizing intake and testing of speci mens or sa mples before analy sis, (h) Secure storag e of critical a gents and sam ples of forensic value, and (i) Appropriate levels of suppl ies and equip - ment needed to respond t o chem ical terrorism events.

(An Iowa Department of Publi c Health, local public health agencies, and hospita ls action step.) 254 Goal Statement Develop a comprehensive plan to i n- crease surge capacity for health care that includes: 1. Triage, treatment and initial stabili za- tion of 500 adult and pediatric patients per 1,000,000 above the current dail y staffed bed capacity with acute illnesses or trauma requiring hospitalizatio n from a chemical, biological, radiological, nu- clear, or explosive inci dent; 2. Negative pressure isolation capacity ; 3. Personnel; 4. Pharmaceutical caches; 5. Personal protective equipment; and 6. Decontamination. Baselin e: No plan (2 004). Chap ter 2 5 Page 4 of 10 April 2005 Emergency Preparedness & Response HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Rationale All hospitals license for a s pecific num ber of beds and staff the facility based on those num - bers. Plans need to be m ade and tested to dem - onstrate how a facility would m eet the needs of a sudden, large influx of pati ents presenting for treatment in an emergency . The facility also needs to be prepared to deal with the num bers of \"worried well \" that would present, testing the facility's abili ty to triage in an em ergency situa- tion. Hospita ls need to pla n for surge capacity in a variety of public health e mergenci es, each of which wou ld dem and a specific and different response. Communicable disease and che mical emergenci es would require different res ponses; dealing with i solation, deco ntam ination, and pharmaceutic al cashe s in different way s. This will require additional trai ning f or hospital staff. 254.1 Action Step By 2008, dev elop an inven tory of all ava il- able hospital-based isolation facilities, fixed and mobile, together with the operational character- istics of the facilities, throughout Iowa. (An Iowa Department of Publi c Health and local hospital action step.) 254.2 Action Step By 2010, establish at least one negative pressure, (Hi gh Efficiency Particulate A ir) HEPA-filtered isolation fa cility in each of the licensed hospitals. (An Iowa Department of Public Health and local hos pitals action step.) 254.3 Action Step By 2010, purchase equip ment and/or pro- vide funds for capital i mprovements to assure safe and effe ctive isola tion and decontamination of large number of patient s with co mmunicable disease s. (An Iowa Depart ment of Public Health and local hos pital action step.) 254.4 Action Step By 2010, create a plan for the recruit ment and m anagement of person nel in a surge situa- tion, i ncludin g those with e xpertise in adult and/or pediatr ic health care. (Iowa Departm ent of Public Health and l ocal hospitals action step.) 254.5 Action Step By 2010, pur chase adequat e personnel pro- tective equipment based on the assess ment in 2004 to m eet the HRSA Hospital Bioterrorism Preparedness Program guidelines. (An Iowa Department of Public Health and h ospitals ac- tion step.) 254.6 Action Step By 2010 purc hase needed deconta mination equipm ent for hospitals in to m eet the HRSA Hospi tal Bioterrorism Preparedne ss Pro- gram guidelin es. (An Iowa Department of Pub- lic Health an d hospitals action step.) 254.7 Action Step By 2010, dev elop a surge p harmaceutical cache sy stem that will take into account s helf- life expiration considera tions of m edications, vaccines and supplies. The se sy stem s will com - plem ent the Strategic Natio nal Stockpile (SNS). (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health action step.) 254.8 Action Step By 2010, ide ntify off-site options f or in- creasing bed capacity such as mobile facilities, temporary facilities appropr iate to an austere environm ent, large convention halls, armories, and state fair groun ds. (An Iowa Department of Public Health, A merican Red Cross, and local hospitals action step.) 255 Goal Statement Maintain plans for and implement addi- tional training and exercising for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) pro- gram at the local, regional and state level that includes 1) Receiving, Staging and Storing (RSS) site, 2) Distribution union nodes and 3) Dispensing and Vaccina- tion Clinics cinatio n clini cs. Source: 2004 CDC gra nt out- come data. April 2005 Chap ter 2 5 Page 5 of 10 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Emergency Preparedness & Response Rationale In a biological or chem ical incident, state, local and private stocks of medical material will deplete quickly. The SNS can ensure the avail- abilit y and ra pid depl oyment of life-saving pharmaceutic als, antidotes, other m edical sup- plies, and equipment neces sary to m ore rapidly mitigate the results of an incident. 255.1 Action Step Throug h 2010, annuall y review fundin g, human and other resources, to support local, re- gional and sta te entities to maintain the dispens- ing and vaccination clinics. (An Iowa Depart- ment of Publi c Health actio n plan.) 255.2 Action Step Throug h 2010, annuall y collaborate with public information officers at the state an d local level to prepare public comm unication cam - paigns. (An I owa Depart ment of Publ ic Health and local public health agencies action s tep.) 255.3 Action Step By 2010, develop the proc edure that will be used to m onitor, store and manage large quanti- ties of sm allpox vaccine within sm allpox re- sponse resources (hospitals, health care facili- ties, public he alth clinics). (An Iowa Depart- ment of Publi c Health actio n step.) 255.4 Action Step Throug h 2010, annuall y collaborate with the regions to de velop plans f or pharm aceuticals needed in chemical and rad iological terroris m events. (An Iowa Department of Publ ic Health action step.) 256 Goal Statement Develop a plan to address the impact of mental health concerns on 5,000 adult and pediatric clients a nd health care workers pe r 1,000,000 population ex- posed to a biological, chemical, radio- logical, or explosive terrorist incident. Baselin e: No plan (20 04). Rationale Victi ms of and responders to a disaster of any kind can experience a variety of stress rea c- tions. Man y develop critical sy mptoms, which if not addressed can lead to chronic post-trau matic stress syndrome, anxiety and depression. This system can address mental health concerns to reduce the i mpact on patients, fa milies a nd health care w orkers. 256.1 Action Step By 2010, defi ne hospitals, outpatient cen- ters, and other organizations that will provide mental health and substance abuse servi ces ap- propriate to t he aftermath of a terrorist incident or pub lic health emergency . (An Iowa Depart- ment of Publi c Health and Iowa Department of Human Services a ction step.) 256.2 Action Step By 2010, dev elop a list of available behav- ioral health and substance abuse staff tr ained in incident stress manage ment and substance abuse prevention an d interventio n. (An Iowa Depart- ment of Hu man Services a nd Iowa Depart ment of Public Health action step.) 256.3 Action Step By 2010, dev elop and diss eminate mental health and substance abuse mess ages to the populati on af fected by a terrorist attack or pub lic health em ergency. (An Iowa Department of Human Services and Iowa Depart ment of Public Health action step.) 256.4 Action Step By 2007, for m a coalition charged with the implem entation of a m ental health and s ubstance abuse section of the Iowa Emergency Response plan. The coalition will be asked to address mental health and substance abuse activi ties di- rected at the care of both fir st responders and the general popul ation. (An Io wa Department of Human Services and Iowa Depart ment of Public Health action step.) Chap ter 2 5 Page 6 of 10 April 2005 Emergency Preparedness & Response HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision 257 Goal Statement Develop a secure, Web-based reporting and notification s ystem that provides for rapid and accurate receipt of reports of disease outbreaks and other acute health events that might suggest bioter- rorism on a 24-hour-per-da y, 7 da y-per- week basis. Baseli ne: Paper b ased system (2004). Rationale Early identification of a terrorist event, other infectious disease outbreak , or other public health e mergency is essential to protect the health of all I owans. Timely and com plete re- porting of dis eases will facilitate the earl y detec- tion of a terrorist event, other infectious disease outbreak, or other public he alth em ergen cy. 257.1 Action Step By 2006, eng age state and local public health agencies, hospitals, and laboratories in require ment gathering sessi ons to review current business practices as well as the definition of future busine ss practic es related to disease re- porting and s urveillance in Iowa. (An Iowa De- partm ent of Public Health action step.) 257.2 Action Step By 2010, create conceptual visual represe n- tations of user inputs and outputs, m odify (Pennsy lvania National Electronic Dise ase Sur- veillance Sy stem) PA NE DSS and restructuring existing business practic es within Iowa Depart- ment of Publi c Health's (Center for Acute Dis- ease Epide miology) CAD E and across the State of Iowa, using real-life exa mples and sc enarios to ensure all aspects of a diseas e outbreak are incorporated. (An Iowa Departm ent of Public Health action step.) 257.3 Action Step By 2010, con struct actual user inputs, o ut- puts and training tools utili zing the visua l repre- sentations cre ated as an outco me of the Design phase, enhancing PA NE DSS and existing tools within CADE.

April 2005 Chap ter 2 5 Page 7 of 10 HI 2010 - Mid-Course Revision Emergency Preparedness & Response 257.10 Action Step By 2010, establish electronic co mmunica- tions and Lab orator y Response Network (LRN) electronic laborator y report ing to enable integra- tion with CD C's LRN capacity monitoring ef- forts, online r esults s urveil- lance, proficiency testing, multi-center valida- tion studies, a nd sup port fo r site en- hancem ents. (A University Hy gienic Laborator y action step.) 257.11 Action Step By 2010, develop a sy stem for electronic reporting of laboratory results to hospitals, local public health, and clinicians that ensures rapid access to criti cal diagnostic inform ation. (A University Hygienic Laboratory action step.) 258 Goal Statement Exercise, assess and implement needed change in plans annuall y to demo nstrate proficienc y in responding to terrorism attacks, natural disasters, infectious dis- ease outbreaks, and other public health threats and emergencies. Baseline: An- nual exerci ses at local, reg ional an d stat e level. Rationale An exercised, com prehensi ve response plan is necessary to mount an effective respo nse to any actual ter rorist event, other infectious dis- ease outbreak , or other public health e mergency . 258.1 Action Step Throug h 2010, cond uct on e sim ulation exer- cise per y ear, involving at l east one threat agent in Category A, that specif ically tests laboratory readiness and capability to perform from speci- men threat assessment, intake prioritization, test- ing, confirm ation, and results reporting using the LRN website. (A University Hygienic L abora- tory action step.) 258.2 Action Step Through 2010, at least annually assess through exercises or after- action reports to ac- tual events, th e 24/7 capacity for respons e to reports of urgent cases, outbreaks, or other pub-lic health e mergencies, inc luding any events that suggest intentional release of a biologic, chemi- cal or radiological agent. (An Iowa Dep artment of Public Health, hosp itals and local public health agencies action step .) 258.3 Action Step By 2010, conduct an exercise that specif i- cally tests che mical terroris m laboratory readi- ness and capability to detect and identify at least one che mical-threat agent. (A University Hygi- enic Laboratory action step.) 259 Goal Statement Develop a self-sustaining pa yment sys- tem and user netw ork to assure that emergenc y responders have ongoing access to the Health Alert Netw ork (HAN) and the vital tools it provides. Baseline: System is in place (20 04) and ha s 1700 user licenses (includes but not limited to publ ic health, health care, state a gencies, Iowa State Extension, an d emergen cy manag ement). Rationale In the event of a public health emergenc y or other disaster , the exchange of inform ation is crucial to a succes sful resp onse. If an effective communicati ons sy stem is in place, it will assist response partners to m itigate the situation in an effective man ner. 259.1 Action Step By 2010, im plem ent a seco nd m ethod of receiving critical alert s such as pagers, cell phones, voice mailboxes, or other devices to allow public health participants to receive alerts in full redundancy with e- mail.

(An Io wa Department of Pub- lic Health act ion step.) 2510 Goal Statement Ensure that at least 90% of local p ublic health agencies use the Learning Man- agement Sy stem (L MS) to educate, evaluate and document educational competency of their staff in their as- signed roles for emergenc y respo nse, to access avai lable training listings, and to track trainings taken via LMS . Baseline: 7%. Source: LMS 2004 d ata. Rationale The staff of existing health care agenci es will be the people who will respond to a n emer- gency . The present workforce needs to have training about bioterrorism , infectious diseas e outbreaks, an d other p ublic health threats and emergenci es. This training also needs to be docum ented a nd tracked. In m any cases, appro- priate training program s exist and the c hallenge is to connect appropriate h ealth care providers to appropriate training. 2510.1 Action Step Throug h 2010, provide o ngoing (at least annual) specialized epidemiolog y investi gation and response training for state and local public health and ho spital staff who woul d respond to a bioterrorism event.
