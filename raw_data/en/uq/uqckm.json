County, we are starting to see a [substantial spike in community transmission](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=3240). There has been a rapid and sustained increase in new daily cases of COVID-19, as well as an increase in hospitalizations, which is being [driven significantly by the spread of the Delta variant among the unvaccinated population](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/why-the-delta-variant-is-causing-an-explosion-of-cases-among-the-unvaccinated). We strongly recommend those who have not yet done so to get vaccinated as soon as possible for the safety of themselves and the community and to be in compliance with [UC's COVID-19 vaccine requirement](/uc-announces-covid-19-vaccination-policy/). Although efficacy rates for approved COVID-19 vaccines are high, this increased prevalence of COVID-19 in L.A. County may also put fully vaccinated individuals at risk. In light of this, [a new L.A. County Department of Public Health order (PDF)](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/docs/HOO/HOO_SaferReturnWorkCommunity.pdf) has been issued and will go into effect on Saturday, July 17 at 11:59 p.m. that requires everyone \u2014 regardless of vaccination status \u2014 to wear a face mask when in all public indoor settings and businesses. At UCLA, this means that all individuals, whether fully vaccinated or not, will be required to wear face masks in all public indoor spaces. Additional guidance is as follows: Personal indoor spaces Face masks are being recommended while in personal living environments and closed-door offices when in the presence of people from outside of one's household. Eating indoors When eating indoors, masks may be removed just prior to eating and must be worn again as soon as individuals are finished eating. Outdoor spaces Although this new mandate does not include an outdoor masking requirement, it is still recommended, especially for unvaccinated individuals, to wear a mask when outside in large groups. Summer youth camps Face masks are also required for those working and participating in summer youth camp activities \u2014 both indoors and outdoors \u2014 except when eating, in which case masks may be removed as long as physical distancing is maintained. In tandem with this new mandate, starting Monday, July 26, UCLA will be resuming mandatory weekly COVID-19 testing for all UCLA students, faculty and staff members who are coming to campus and other UCLA properties, regardless of vaccination status, which includes those who were previously approved to opt out of testing. We strongly encourage resumption of testing before the 26th to become familiar with the new testing method. [As previously communicated](/new-self-administered-covid-19-saliva-tests-available-july-12/), anyone with an active BruinCard may retrieve up to two self-administered saliva-based COVID-19 tests per week from one of more than a dozen [COVID-19 test vending machines and distribution centers](https://www.studenthealth.ucla.edu/covid-19-self-test-options-campus) located throughout the campus. Those requiring in-person testing or who are unable to get a test kit from a vending machine, as well as those who need help with testing for any other reason, may go to 300 Bradley Hall for assistance. In addition, [daily symptom monitoring](https://uclasurveys.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3qRLtouCYKzBbH7) is still required by Cal/OSHA for faculty, staff and student workers who are coming to campus and other UCLA properties, regardless of vaccination status. We know these changes should not be made lightly and may be inconvenient, but they are critical if we are to get back on track in terms of reducing the presence of COVID-19 in our communities. We appreciate your ongoing flexibility and continued cooperation as we take the necessary steps to progress with our phased return to campus. Sincerely, Michael J. Beck Administrative Vice Chancellor Co-chair, COVID-19 Response and Recovery Task Force Michael Meranze Immediate Past Chair, UCLA Academic Senate Professor of History Co-chair, COVID-19 Response and Recovery Task "}
