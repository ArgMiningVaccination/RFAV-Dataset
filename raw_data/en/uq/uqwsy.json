Campus Security The Washington University campus is among the most attractive in the nation, and it enjoys a safe and relaxed atmosphere. Personal safety and the security of personal property while on campus is a shared responsibility. Washington University has made safety and security a priority through our commitment to a full-time professional police department, the use of closed- circuit television, card access, good lighting, shuttle services, emergency telephones, and ongoing educational safety awareness programs. The vast majority of crimes that occur on college campuses are crimes of opportunity, which can be prevented. The best protection against crime is an informed and alert campus community. Washington University has developed several programs to help make everyone's experiences here safe and secure. An extensive network of emergency telephones \u2014 including more than 200 \"blue light\" telephones \u2014 is connected directly to the University Police Department and can alert the police to a person's exact location. In addition to the regular shuttle service, an evening walking escort service and a mobile Campus Circulator shuttle are available on the Danforth Campus. The Campus2Home shuttle will provide a safe ride home for those living in four designated areas off campus \u2014 Skinker- DeBaliviere, Loop South, north of the Loop, and just south of the campus \u2014 from 7:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. seven days a week. The shuttle leaves from the Mallinckrodt Bus Plaza and Forsyth/ Goldfarb Hall Center every 15 minutes from 7:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. and at the top (:00) and bottom (:30) of the hour from 1:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m. The shuttle takes passengers directly to the front doors of their buildings. Shuttle drivers will then wait and watch to make sure passengers get into their buildings safely. Community members can track the shuttle in real time using the WUSTL Mobile App. The app can be downloaded free of charge from the Apple iTunes Store or the Google Play Store.The University Police Department is a full-service organization staffed by certified police officers who patrol the campus 24 hours a day throughout the entire year. The department offers a variety of crime prevention programs, including a high-security bicycle lock program, free personal-safety whistles, computer security tags, personal safety classes for women and men, and security surveys. Community members are encouraged to download and install the WashU Safe personal safety app on their phones; this app allows users to call for help during emergencies, to use Friend Walk to track their walks on and off campus, and to access many additional safety features. For more information about these programs, visit the Washington University Police Department website (https://police.wustl.edu/). In compliance with the Campus Crime Awareness and Security Act of 1990, Washington University publishes an annual report (http://police.wustl.edu/clery-reports-logs/) entitled Safety & Security: Guide for Students, Faculty, and Staff \u2014 Annual Campus Security and Fire Safety Reports and Drug & Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program .

In addition, policies may be amended throughout the year. Nondiscrimination Statement Washington University encourages and gives full consideration to all applicants for admission, financial aid and employment. The university does not discriminate in access to, treatment during, or employment in its programs and activities on the basis of race, color, age, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, veteran status, disability or genetic information. 19Bulletin 2022-23 About Washington University in St. Louis (08/12/22) Policy on Discrimination and Harassment Washington University is committed to having a positive learning and working environment for its students, faculty and staff. University policy prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, age, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, veteran status, disability or genetic information. Harassment based on any of these classifications is a form of discrimination; it violates university policy and will not be tolerated. In some circumstances, such discriminatory harassment may also violate federal, state or local law. A copy of the Policy on Discrimination and Harassment (http://hr.wustl.edu/ policies/Pages/DiscriminationAndHarassment.aspx ) is available on the Human Resources website. Sexual Harassment Sexual harassment is a form of discrimination that violates university policy and will not be tolerated. It is also illegal under state and federal law. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination based on sex (including sexual harassment and sexual violence) in the university's educational programs and activities. Title IX also prohibits retaliation for asserting claims of sex discrimination. The university has designated the Title IX Coordinator identified below to coordinate its compliance with and response to inquiries concerning Title IX.

Violations of the Washington University Drug and Alcohol Policy (https://hr.wustl.edu/items/drug-and- alcohol-policy/ ) or the Alcohol Policy for Graduate Student Organizations (https://sites.wustl.edu/prograds/university-wide- graduate-student-group-handbook/alcohol-policy-for-graduate- student-organizations/ ) will be handled according to existing policies and procedures concerning the conduct of faculty, staff and students. This policy is adopted in accordance with the Drug-Free Workplace Act and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act. Tobacco-Free Policy Washington University is committed to providing a healthy, comfortable and productive work and learning environment for all students, faculty and staff. Research shows that tobacco use in general, including smoking and breathing secondhand smoke, constitutes a significant health hazard. The university strictly prohibits all smoking and other uses of tobacco products within all university buildings and on university property, at all times. A copy of our complete Tobacco-Free Policy (https://hr.wustl.edu/ items/tobacco-free-policy/ ) is available on the Human Resources website. Medical Examinations Entering students must provide medical information to the Habif Health and Wellness Center. This will include the completion of a health history and a record of all current immunizations. If students fail to comply with these requirements prior to registration, they will be required to obtain vaccinations for measles, mumps and rubella at the Habif Health and Wellness Center, if there is no evidence of immunity. In addition, undergraduate students will be required to obtain meningitis vaccinations. Students will be assessed the cost of the vaccinations. Students will be unable to complete registration for classes until all health requirements have been satisfied. Noncompliant students may be barred from classes and from all university facilities, including housing units, if in the judgment of the university their continued presence would pose a health risk to themselves or to the university community. Medical and immunization information is to be given via the Habif Health and Wellness Center (https://students.wustl.edu/ habif-health-wellness-center/) website. All students who have completed the registration process should access the website and create a student profile by using their WUSTL Key. Creating a student profile enables a student to securely access the 20Bulletin 2022-23 About Washington University in St. Louis (08/12/22) medical history form. Students should fill out the form and follow the instructions for transmitting it to the Habif Health and Wellness Center. Student information is treated securely and confidentially. Student Conduct The Student Conduct Code sets forth community standards and expectations for Washington University students. These community standards and expectations are intended to foster an environment conducive to learning and inquiry. Freedom of thought and expression is essential to the university's academic mission. Disciplinary proceedings are meant to be informal, fair and expeditious. Charges of non-serious misconduct are generally heard by the student conduct officer. With limited exceptions, serious or repeated allegations are heard by the campuswide Student Conduct Board or the University Sexual Assault Investigation Board where applicable. Complaints against students that include allegations of sexual assault or certain complaints that include allegations of sexual harassment in violation of the Student Conduct Code are governed by the procedures found in the University Sexual Assault Investigation Board Policy (https://wustl.edu/about/ compliance-policies/governance/usaib-procedures-complaints- sexual-assault-filed-students/ ), which is available online or in hard copy from the Title IX coordinator or the director of Student Conduct and Community Standards. Students may be accountable to both governmental authorities and to the university for acts that constitute violations of law and the Student Conduct Code. For a complete copy of the Student Conduct Code (https:// wustl.edu/about/compliance-policies/academic-policies/ university-student-judicial-code/), visit the university website. Undergraduate Student Academic Integrity Policy Effective learning, teaching and research all depend upon the ability of members of the academic community to trust one another and to trust the integrity of work that is submitted for academic credit or conducted in the wider arena of scholarly research. Such an atmosphere of mutual trust fosters the free exchange of ideas and enables all members of the community to achieve their highest potential. In all academic work, the ideas and contributions of others must be appropriately acknowledged, and work that is presented as original must be, in fact, original. Faculty, students and administrative staff all share the responsibility of ensuring the honesty and fairness of the intellectual environment at Washington University.Scope and Purpose This statement on academic integrity applies to all undergraduate students at Washington University. Graduate students are governed by policies in each graduate school or division. All students are expected to adhere to the highest standards of behavior. The purpose of the statement is twofold: 1.To clarify the university's expectations with regard to undergraduate students' academic behavior; and 2.To provide specific examples of dishonest conduct. The examples are only illustrative, not exhaustive. Violations of This Policy Include but Are Not Limited to the Following: 1.Plagiarism Plagiarism consists of taking someone else's ideas, words or other types of work product and presenting them as one's own. To avoid plagiarism, students are expected to be attentive to proper methods of documentation and acknowledgment. To avoid even the suspicion of plagiarism, a student must always do the following: Enclose every quotation in quotation marks and acknowledge its source. Cite the source of every summary, paraphrase, abstraction or adaptation of material originally prepared by another person and any factual data that is not considered common knowledge. Include the name of author, title of work, publication information and page reference. Acknowledge material obtained from lectures, interviews or other oral communication by citing the source (i.e., the name of the speaker, the occasion, the place and the date). Cite material from the internet as if it were from a traditionally published source. Follow the citation style or requirements of the instructor for whom the work is produced. 2.Cheating on an Examination A student must not receive or provide any unauthorized assistance on an examination. During an examination, a student may use only materials authorized by the faculty. 3.Copying or Collaborating on Assignments Without Permission When a student submits work with their name on it, this is a written statement that credit for the work belongs to that student alone. If the work was a product of collaboration, each student is expected to clearly acknowledge in writing all persons who contributed to its completion. 21Bulletin 2022-23 About Washington University in St. Louis (08/12/22) Unless the instructor explicitly states otherwise, it is dishonest to collaborate with others when completing any assignment or test, performing laboratory experiments, writing and/or documenting computer programs, writing papers or reports, or completing problem sets. If the instructor allows group work in some circumstances but not others, it is the student's responsibility to understand the degree of acceptable collaboration for each assignment and to ask for clarification, if necessary. To avoid cheating or unauthorized collaboration, a student should never do any of the following: Use, copy or paraphrase the results of another person's work and represent that work as one's own, regardless of the circumstances. Refer to, study from or copy archival files (e.g., old tests, homework, solutions manuals, backfiles) that were not approved by the instructor. Copy another's work or permit another student to copy one's work. Submit work as a collaborative effort if they did not contribute a fair share of the effort. 4.Fabrication or Falsification of Data or Records It is dishonest to fabricate or falsify data in laboratory experiments, research papers or reports or in any other circumstances; to fabricate source material in a bibliography or \"works cited\" list; or to provide false information on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or other document in connection with academic efforts. It is also dishonest to take data developed by someone else and present them as one's own. Examples of falsification include the following: Altering information on any exam, problem set or class assignment being submitted for a re-grade. Altering, omitting or inventing laboratory data to submit as one's own findings. This includes copying laboratory data from another student to present as one's own; modifying data in a write-up; and providing data to another student to submit as one's own. 5.Other Forms of Deceit, Dishonesty or Inappropriate Conduct Under no circumstances is it acceptable for a student to do any of the following: Submit the same work, or essentially the same work, for more than one course without explicitly obtaining permission from all instructors. A student must disclose when a paper or project builds on work completed earlier in their academic career. Request an academic benefit based on false information or deception. This includes requesting an extension of time, a better grade or a recommendation from an instructor.Make any changes (including adding material or erasing material) on any test paper, problem set or class assignment being submitted for a re-grade. Willfully damage the efforts or work of other students. Steal, deface or damage academic facilities or materials. Collaborate with other students planning or engaging in any form of academic misconduct. Submit any academic work under someone else's name other than one's own. This includes but is not limited to sitting for another person's exam; both parties will be held responsible. Engage in any other form of academic misconduct not covered here. This list is not intended to be exhaustive. To seek clarification, students should ask the professor or the assistant in instruction for guidance. Reporting Misconduct Faculty Responsibility Faculty and instructors are strongly encouraged to report incidents of student academic misconduct to the academic integrity officer in their school or college in a timely manner so that the incident may be handled fairly and consistently across schools and departments. Assistants in instruction are expected to report instances of student misconduct to their supervising instructors. Faculty members are expected to respond to student concerns about academic dishonesty in their courses. Student Responsibility If a student observes others violating this policy, the student is strongly encouraged to report the misconduct to the instructor, to seek advice from the academic integrity officer of the school or college that offers the course in question, or to address the student(s) directly. Exam Proctor Responsibility Exam proctors are expected to report incidents of suspected student misconduct to the course instructor and/or the Disability Resource Center, if applicable. Procedure Jurisdiction This policy covers all undergraduate students, regardless of their college of enrollment. Cases will be heard by school- specific committees according to the school in which the class is listed rather than the school in which the student is enrolled. All violations and sanctions will be reported to the student's college of enrollment. 22Bulletin 2022-23 About Washington University in St. Louis (08/12/22) Administrative Procedures Individual undergraduate colleges and schools may design specific procedures to resolve allegations of academic misconduct by students in courses offered by that school, so long as the procedures are consistent with this policy and with the Student Conduct Code. Student Rights and Responsibilities in a Hearing A student accused of an academic integrity violation \u2014 whether by a professor, an assistant in instruction, an academic integrity officer or another student \u2014 is entitled to do the following: Review the written evidence in support of the charge Ask any questions Offer an explanation as to what occurred Present any material that would cast doubt on the correctness of the charge Receive a determination of the validity of the charge without reference to any past record of misconduct When responding to a charge of academic misconduct, a student may do the following: Deny the charges and request a hearing in front of the appropriate academic integrity officer or committee Admit the charges and request a hearing to determine sanction(s) Admit the charges and accept the imposition of sanctions without a hearing Request a leave of absence from the university (however, the academic integrity matter must be resolved prior to re- enrollment) Request to withdraw permanently from the university with a transcript notation that there is an unresolved academic integrity matter pending A student has the following responsibilities with regard to resolving the charge of academic misconduct: Admit or deny the charge. This will determine the course of action to be pursued. Provide truthful information regarding the charges. It is a Student Conduct Code violation to provide false information to the university or anyone acting on its behalf. Sanctions If Found Not in Violation of the Academic Integrity Policy If the charges of academic misconduct are not proven, no record of the allegation will appear on the student's transcript.If Found in Violation of the Academic Integrity Policy If, after a hearing, a student is found to have acted dishonestly or if a student has admitted to the charges prior to a hearing, the school's academic integrity officer or committee may impose sanctions, including but not limited to the following: Issue a formal written reprimand Impose educational sanctions, such as completing a workshop on plagiarism or academic ethics Recommend to the instructor that the student fail the assignment (a given grade is ultimately the prerogative of the instructor) Recommend to the instructor that the student fail the course Recommend to the instructor that the student receive a course grade penalty less severe than failure of the course Place the student on disciplinary probation for a specified period of time or until defined conditions are met. The probation will be noted on the student's transcript and internal record while it is in force. In cases serious enough to warrant suspension or expulsion from the university, refer the matter to the Student Conduct Board for consideration. Additional educational sanctions may be imposed. This list is not intended to be exhaustive. Withdrawing from the course will not prevent the academic integrity officer or hearing panel from adjudicating the case, imposing sanctions or recommending grade penalties, including a failing grade in the course. A copy of the sanction letter will be placed in the student's academic file. Appeals If a student believes the academic integrity officer or the committee did not conduct a fair hearing or if a student believes the sanction imposed for misconduct is excessive, they may appeal to the Student Conduct Board within 14 days of the original decision. Appeals are governed by Section VII C of the Student Conduct Code. Records Administrative Record-Keeping Responsibilities It is the responsibility of the academic integrity officer in each school to keep accurate, confidential records concerning academic integrity violations. When a student has been found to have acted dishonestly, a letter summarizing the allegation, the outcome and the sanction shall be placed in the student's official file in the office of the school or college in which the student is enrolled. 23Bulletin 2022-23 About Washington University in St. Louis (08/12/22) In addition, each school's academic integrity officer shall make a report of the outcome of every formal accusation of student academic misconduct to the director of Student Conduct and Community Standards, who shall maintain a record of each incident. Multiple Offenses When a student is formally accused of academic misconduct and a hearing is to be held by an academic integrity officer, a committee, or the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards, the person in charge of administering the hearing shall query the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards about the student(s) accused of misconduct. The director shall provide any information in the records concerning that student to the integrity officer. Such information will be used in determining sanctions only if the student is found to have acted dishonestly in the present case. Evidence of past misconduct may not be used to resolve the issue of whether a student has acted dishonestly in a subsequent case. Reports to Faculty and Student Body School and college academic integrity officers are encouraged to make periodic (at least annual) reports to the students and faculty of their school concerning accusations of academic misconduct and the outcomes, without disclosing specific information that would allow identification of the student(s) involved. Graduate Student Academic Integrity Policies For graduate student academic integrity policies, please refer to each individual graduate school. Statement of Intent to Graduate Students are required to file an Intent to Graduate via WebSTAC (https://acadinfo.wustl.edu/ ) prior to the semester in which they intend to graduate.

Academic and Professional Integrity for PhD Students The Academic and Professional Integrity Policy of the former Graduate School (https://wustl.app.box.com/ s/7p84v07ly47rz2gfo2xy0vrqoifpikts/ ) continues to apply to all PhD students on the Danforth and Medical campuses, including dual-degree students when one of the degree programs is a PhD program. Involuntary Leave of Absence The Involuntary Leave of Absence Policy (https://wustl.edu/ about/compliance-policies/governance/involuntary-leave-policy- undergraduate-students/ ) that applies to undergraduates was adopted to apply to all PhD students in 2014. Financial Policies & Practices Child Day Care Subsidy The purpose of the Child Day Care Subsidy is to help financially stressed graduate student families meet the costs of child day care tuition at licensed facilities while they pursue PhD degrees. The amount of Child Day Care Subsidy awarded to eligible applicants is based on their financial need, the number of children they have enrolled in licensed child day care facilities, their child day care expenses, and available funding. Eligible students can expect the following: For one child, the maximum award is $1,750 per semester. For two children, the maximum award is $2,650 per semester. For three or more children, the maximum award is $3,550 per semester. The subsidy amount cannot exceed the cost of the licensed child day care facility. Students should contact their home schools for more information and for application instructions. Interdisciplinary Courses PhD students can speak with their advisors with regard to enrolling in individual courses available outside of their school that may advance their research or professional goals. A university tuition agreement signed by all of the deans of the university's graduate and professional schools fosters 26Bulletin 2022-23 About Washington University in St. Louis (08/12/22) interdisciplinary study across the schools and allows enrollment in classes outside of the student's home school. Many undergraduate and graduate courses are available for graduate student enrollment, subject to the following eligibility guidelines: The student must be enrolled full-time in a graduate degree program and have the approval of their faculty advisor or administrative officer to take a course outside of their home school. Courses will be open to students outside of the discipline only if those students have met the required prerequisites and have the approval of both their department/advisor and the course instructor. Finally, courses in the evening divisions, including University College and its Summer School, are not part of this agreement. Courses that require individualized instruction and/or additional fees (e.g., independent studies, individual music lessons) are also excluded. Minimum Stipend Award The amounts and vehicles of financial support for graduate students are usually decided by the individual schools. Washington University is committed to funding most PhD students for five to six years, depending on the time needed to complete a particular program. Funding typically consists of full tuition remission and a stipend to defray living expenses. Monetary support may come from the university or from outside sources, and it is usually administered by an administrative staff member of the program or the school acting in accordance with instructions received from the program/school administration or from a faculty member. New Child Leave Full-time PhD students may request a New Child Leave to assume care for a new child. They should maintain their full-time student status. Students on New Child Leave are not expected to participate in mentored teaching or research experience for up to 60 calendar days while they receive their current stipend support. Additional time off without receiving a stipend for up to a full semester will ordinarily be granted by the student's home school if approved by the student's department. New Child Leave does not affect the student's full-time status and will not appear on the student's official transcript. New child leave must be taken within the first year after the child's birth or adoption. Students should contact their department to request a New Child Leave. Students who receive support from external agencies should consult the policies and guidelines of the sponsor.PhD General Requirements To earn a PhD at Washington University, a student must complete all courses required by their department/program; maintain satisfactory academic progress; pass certain examinations; fulfill residence and mentored experience requirements; write, defend, and submit a dissertation; and file an Intent to Graduate form via WebSTAC (https:// acadinfo.wustl.edu ). Residence Requirement Each PhD student must spend at least one academic year enrolled full-time at Washington University. Any exceptions must be approved by the dean of the student's respective school and the Vice Provost for Graduate Education. Program Length Limit The maximum number of semesters of continuous enrollment is 18 (9 years). Students in PhD programs who have not completed their terminal degrees and who have not withdrawn will be dismissed at the end of 18 semesters. An exception may be granted by the dean of the student's respective school on request by the designated faculty graduate program director (in most departments, this position is called the Director of Graduate Studies) if the student is expected to complete their degree during a tenth year of enrollment. Enrollment for an eleventh continuous year will not be allowed. Semesters during which the student is on an approved leave of absence are not included on the enrollment clock. Qualifying Examinations Progress toward the PhD is contingent upon the student passing examinations that are variously called preliminary, qualifying, general, comprehensive or major field exams. The qualifying process varies according to the program. In some programs, it consists of a series of incremental, sequential and cumulative exams over a considerable time. In others, the exams are held during a relatively short period of time. Exams may be replaced by one or more papers. The program, which determines the structure and schedule of the required examinations, is responsible for notifying the school registrar or the appropriate record custodian of the student's outcome, whether successful or unsuccessful. Mentored Experience Requirement PhD students at Washington University must complete a department-defined Mentored Experience. The Mentored Experience Requirement is a doctoral degree milestone that is notated on the student's transcript when complete. Each department has an established Mentored Experience Implementation Plan in which the number of semesters that a student must engage in a Mentored Teaching Experience or a Mentored Professional Experience is defined. The Mentored Experience Implementation Plans outline how doctoral students within the discipline will be mentored to achieve competencies 27Bulletin 2022-23 About Washington University in St. Louis (08/12/22) in teaching at basic and advanced levels. Some departments may elect to include the Mentored Professional Experiences as an avenue for completing one or more semesters of the Mentored Experience Requirement. Doctoral students will enroll in Mentored Teaching Experiences or Mentored Professional Experiences to signify their progression toward completing the overall Mentored Experience Requirement for their degree. Dissertation As evidence of the mastery of a specific field of knowledge and of the capacity for original scholarly work, each candidate must complete a dissertation. Each PhD candidate will form a Research Advisory Committee (RAC) approved by their department or program and by their school's graduate program oversight body. The RAC will approve the subject and approach of the dissertation, which will be evidenced by the student's completion of the Title, Scope and Procedure requirement. The RAC should consist of at least three full-time Washington University faculty members who are authorized to supervise PhD students and who have appropriate expertise in the proposed field of study. One of these faculty members must be the student's primary research advisor/mentor. Additional members, including external members with active research programs at outside institutions, may serve on the RAC subject to approval by the school's graduate program oversight body. For cross-school/interdisciplinary PhD programs, the approvals referenced above should be obtained from the graduate program oversight body of the school of the primary research advisor/mentor. For a PhD program offered in partnership with an external academic institution, one full-time faculty member of the partner institution who is authorized to supervise PhD students and who has appropriate expertise in the proposed field of study may serve on the RAC as part of the three- member minimum requirement. A Title, Scope and Procedure form for the dissertation must be signed by the RAC members and by the program chair. It must be submitted to the school registrar or the appropriate record custodian at least six months before the degree is expected to be conferred or before the beginning the fifth year of full-time enrollment, whichever is earlier. A Doctoral Dissertation Guide and a template that provides instructions regarding the format of the dissertation are available through the website of the Office of the Provost (https:// provost.wustl.edu/vpge/phd-education-and-governance/ ); both of these should be read carefully at every stage of dissertation preparation. Each student is required to make the full text of the dissertation available to the committee members for their review at least one week before the dissertation defense. Most degree programs require two or more weeks for the review period; students should check their program's policies.Dissertation Defense Approval of the written dissertation by the RAC is strongly recommended before the student can orally defend the dissertation. The dissertation committee that examines the student during the defense consists of at least five members. Normally, the members of the RAC also serve on the dissertation committee. The dissertation committee is then additionally augmented to ensure that the two independent criteria below are met: 1.Four of the five members (or a similar proportion of a larger committee) must be full-time Washington University faculty who are authorized to supervise PhD students and who have appropriate expertise in the proposed field of study; one of these four may be a member of the emeritus faculty. The fifth member must have a doctoral degree and an active research program, whether at Washington University, at another university, in government or in industry. 2.Three of the five members (or a similar proportion of a larger committee) normally come from the student's degree program(s); however, at least one of the five members must be external to the student's degree program(s). The approval processes outlined under RAC formation also apply to the dissertation committee. All committees must be approved by the dean of the student's school of record or by their designee, regardless of whether they meet the normal criteria. The committee is appointed by the dean of the student's school of record upon the request of the degree program. The student is responsible for making the full text of the dissertation accessible to their committee members for their review in advance of the defense according to program rules. Faculty and graduate students who are interested in the subject of the dissertation are normally welcome to attend all or part of the defense but may ask questions only at the discretion of the committee members. Although there is some variation among degree programs, the defense ordinarily focuses on the dissertation itself and its relation to the student's field of expertise. Dissertation Submission After the defense, the student must submit an electronic copy of the dissertation online to the university. The submission website requires students to choose among publishing and copyrighting services offered by ProQuest ETD Administrator (https://www.etdadmin.com/main/home/), but the university permits students to make whichever choices they prefer. Students are asked to submit the Survey of Earned Doctorates (https://graduateschool.wustl.edu/forms/ ) separately. The degree program is responsible for delivering the final approval form, signed by the committee members at the defense and then by the program chair or director, to the school registrar or the appropriate record custodian. Students who defend 28Bulletin 2022-23 About Washington University in St. Louis (08/12/22) their dissertations successfully have not completed their PhD requirements; they finish earning their degree only when their dissertation submission has been accepted by their school of record. 29Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis Washington University School of Medicine is a world leader in medical education, research and patient care.

Credit 3 units. M17 CLNV 541 Implementation Science: Approaches in Local, Regional and Global Contexts This course will address key conceptual dimensions of implementation science in the setting of social, political and organizational constraints due to inadequate or uncertain investments in health. Such environments create distinctive needs for implementation of evidence-based interventions. These contexts are common in Lower-and-Middle Income countries, where human resources for health, health care infrastructure and investments in social protections are limited. However, limited, concentrated and racialized investments in public health are also characteristic in High-Income Countries, and lead to health disparities. In both cases, this structural 54Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) setting shapes the limitations in availability of evidence-based interventions for health, as well as the strategies needed to overcome those barriers. Specific topics in the course will touch on current global and regional distribution of disease burden, parallels in health systems in health systems in Low- and-Middle-Income countries and regions locally, global trends and efforts around use of evidence based treatments for major infectious diseases (e.g., HIV, TB and Malaria), rising burden of cardiovascular disease, as well as around Global Health, theories and frameworks on health disparities (e.g., post- colonial studies, Black scholarship). Topics will also include conceptualizing implementation strategies (and implementation outcomes) appropriate for this setting, and which are tailored for these constraints; study designs (e.g., stepped wedge, natural experiments) frequently employed in such settings; and the notion of preferences and personalization in public health delivered in such environments. Credit 3 units. M17 CLNV 5544 Developing and Evaluating Implementation Strategies in Health and Social Services Internationally, there is a substantial gap between the establishment of effective interventions and their delivery in routine practice. Implementation research has emerged as a means of addressing that gap. It is defined as \"the scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings and other evidence-based practices\" to improve the quality of service delivery in routine care settings (Eccles & Mittman, 2006). It includes the study of influences on professional and organizational behavior that impact implementation effectiveness. This course focuses on developing and evaluating implementation strategies or the methods and techniques that are used to enhance the adoption, implementation, sustainment, and scaling up of effective interventions. It is intended for graduate students, postdoctoral students, staff, and faculty in public health, social work, medicine, and other areas of health science who are interested in developing and/or testing strategies to promote improved implementation of effective health and social service interventions.

Genetic Counseling The Program in Genetic Counseling is an innovative, 21-month Master of Science program that will prepare graduates to become certified genetic counselors. The program is composed of medical genetic- and counseling-focused curriculum, clinical rotations, and a research project. In the United States, genetic counselors are recognized as individuals who have obtained a master's degree (either MS or MA) from a genetic counseling graduate program accredited by the Accreditation Council for Genetic Counseling (ACGC) (https://www.gceducation.org/). The Program in Genetic Counseling at Washington University has been granted accredited, new program status. Admission to programs accredited by ACGC requires registering for the Genetic Counseling Admissions Match (https://natmatch.com/ gcadmissions/ ). Applicants to the Program in Genetic Counseling must have a bachelor's degree (or equivalent if from a foreign college or university). Most applicants will have majored in biology or a related field (e.g., biochemistry, genetics) or in psychology. Along with the required prerequisite undergraduate course work in genetics, biochemistry, statistics, and psychology, the Program in Genetic Counseling also highly recommends that applicants have obtained the following types of experiences prior to applying: Exposure to the field via shadowing and/or informational interviewing Advocacy and/or counseling experience The mission of the Program in Genetic Counseling at Washington University is to educate future generations of genetic counselors to serve the growing need for diverse, culturally competent, innovative genetic counselors serving patients, working in industry, and conducting research. The objectives of the program are to provide a rigorous curriculum, broad and robust clinical experiences, and expert research guidance to graduate students who are well prepared to fill the ever-expanding professional roles in which genetic counselors may be employed. All graduates of accredited genetic counseling graduate programs are prepared for entry-level genetic counseling positions, regardless of the area of specialization. Common areas of specialization for genetic counselors include oncology, prenatal, pediatrics, neurogenetics, and cardiology. Many genetic counselors do select a specialty area of practice that they focus on throughout their careers. Others change their area of practice many times. The field of genetic counseling provides a great deal of career flexibility. 55Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) As a result of its ACGC accreditation, the Program in Genetic Counseling curriculum meets the educational requirements to sit for the American Board of Genetic Counseling (ABGC) (https://www.abgc.net/ ) Certification Examination and to pursue licensure in all states and territories of the United States and Washington, DC, in which licensure is available.

It is possible to enroll in either program and then apply to transfer to the other program later, as both the master's and doctoral programs share the same curriculum for the first year of study. Students may also decide to apply to both programs if they like. Typically, the doctoral program attracts students who have further interest in research and leadership in the field. 65Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) The Program in Occupational Therapy prepares students for professional practice and, through its research, generates knowledge to address the issues facing individuals with disabilities, chronic diseases and developmental disabilities. Students are prepared as generalists, but they can also concentrate their studies for work in pediatrics, aging, rehabilitation, work and industry, or social participation. The curriculum focuses on the dynamic interaction of the biological with the psychological, environmental and occupational factors that enable persons to fulfill their roles and lead meaningful and productive lives. Students interact with leading physicians and scientists whose practices and science are contributing to better methods for the treatment of persons with disabilities. In addition, students are linked with community agencies and leaders providing services to individuals with disabling conditions. Undergraduate students in pre-medical, psychology, biology or anthropology will find that the program offers a means of applying their knowledge in a professional field. The Program in Occupational Therapy is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education (ACOTE) of the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA), located at 6116 Executive Boulevard, Suite 200, North Bethesda, MD 20852-4929.

M01 OT 690 Rehabilitation Neuroscience The role of experience in shaping brain functions is a central question in psychology and neuroscience. The prevailing view is that the functional organization of even the mature brain is dynamic \u2014 changing in response either to increases or decreases in stimulation. However, this has not always been the accepted perspective. Even now, many fundamental questions remain, and the answers should directly impact the way that we approach learning and the rehabilitation (re-learning) in the future. Just what are the limits on plasticity in the adult brain? How should environments be structured to exploit this capacity effectively? Is all reorganization behaviorally relevant? What factors contribute to adaptive, as opposed to maladaptive, changes? Together, we will consider historical perspectives on, and what is presently known about, these and related questions.

Physical Therapy Physical therapy is the science of human movement applied to rehabilitation, injury, fitness, injury prevention and overall health. Practicing in a variety of settings, physical therapists diagnose and treat movement dysfunction in patients with skill, competence and compassion. The Program in Physical Therapy is committed to providing students with excellent scientific and clinical education in an environment that strives to continually lead the industry in practice, research, innovation and advocacy of movement health. The Program in Physical Therapy at the School of Medicine offers two formal curricula that collectively foster opportunities for lifelong learning and comprehensive career development: the Doctor of Physical Therapy (p. 114) and the PhD in Movement Science (p. 116). 73Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) The Human Movement System Approach The Program in Physical Therapy has pioneered a unique, movement-based approach to physical therapy. The human movement system is at the core of our approach to physical therapy education, research and patient care. This system consists of physiological organ systems that interact to produce and support the movement of the body and its parts. Movement science is the study of the movement system, and we believe physical therapists are the world's movement system experts. Our program (https://outlook.wustl.edu/movement-redefined/ ) has pioneered the development of movement-focused physical therapy education, research and treatment. The human movement system continues to be our foundation for treating patients, conducting research, and training the next generation of leaders in physical therapy. Our vision is aligned with the vision of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) (http:// www.apta.org/ ), which is to \"transform society by optimizing movement to improve the human experience.\" Additional Information Further information, including complete admissions instructions and program descriptions, may be obtained through direct correspondence with the Program in Physical Therapy: Program in Physical Therapy Washington University School of Medicine 4444 Forest Park Avenue, CB 8502 https://pt.wustl.edu Degrees & Offerings Doctor of Physical Therapy (p. 114) PhD in Movement Science (p. 116) Research The mission of the Research Division is to understand how the movement system (https://pt.wustl.edu/about-us/) is affected by disease, injury, lifestyle, development and aging and to understand how movement can be used to promote health by enhancing physical function, activity and participation across the lifespan. Our interdisciplinary scientific endeavors include mechanistic and translational investigations at all levels of organization, from the cell to society. Our research (https://pt.wustl.edu/ research/our-research-areas/ ) is supported by millions of dollars in federal, private foundation and university funding. We pursue knowledge in a collaborative work environment within the Movement Science Research Center (https://pt.wustl.edu/ research/movement-science-research-center/). Our doctoral and postdoctoral Research Training Programs (https://pt.wustl.edu/research/research-training-programs/) prepare students for careers at the forefront of physical therapy and movement science research.

Population Health Sciences The Master of Population Health Sciences (MPHS) offered by the School of Medicine is a 10-month degree program for clinicians, clinical doctorates, medical students and health sciences students seeking training in clinical research methods. The curriculum emphasizes the role of epidemiology and biostatistics in approaching clinical effectiveness and outcomes research for all medical specialties. The MPHS does not require a research thesis upon completion of the program. Instead, the program innovatively uses applied course work to focus on the long-term mastery of skills. Using topics relevant to their careers and interests, MPHS students practice the art of developing research study protocols, performing systematic reviews, designing epidemiologic studies and much more. Many students go on to produce award-winning research using their applied course work and skills learned in the program. MPHS students deepen their learning by choosing one of four concentrations: Clinical Epidemiology, Health Services, Quantitative Methods, or Psychiatric and Behavioral Health Sciences. Contact: Blanka Hodzic, Program Coordinator Email: bhodzic@wustl.edu Website: http://www.mphs.wustl.edu Degrees & Offerings Master of Population Health Sciences (p. 116) Research Research Projects & Assignments The MPHS program uses applied course work, which means students use their own research projects and interests for class discussions and assignments. This format helps our students apply and master research concepts quickly, and it maximizes research productivity during students' time in the program. For example, students will write and design research protocols, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, grant proposals and more. In addition, our instructors select case studies, prioritize reading lists, and shape class discussions from current, in-the- news clinical outcomes research and population health topics. Students are not required to complete a research project for graduation. The focus in the MPHS program is on the practice and mastery of clinical research skill sets for long-term benefit.Students are encouraged to have a primary mentor connected to their research while in the MPHS program.

Audiology and Communication Sciences Doctor of Audiology The Doctor of Audiology (AuD) (https://pacs.wustl.edu/programs/ doctor-of-audiology/ ) program is a four-year course of study that prepares students as independent clinical audiologists. Established in 1947, the program is among the oldest and most prestigious of its kind. Today, its curriculum serves as a national model, immersing students in academic course work, clinical experiences and research opportunities. The program is ranked among the top in the country by U.S. News & World Report; the program and its faculty are internationally recognized and draw a diverse body of students. CurriculumDuring the first three years, the program's course work is integrated with clinical and research training, with students completing and presenting a capstone project during the third year of study. The fourth year is fully dedicated to clinical training. The four-year curriculum (https://pacs.wustl.edu/ programs/doctor-of-audiology/curriculum/ ) emphasizes hands-on experiences and covers the scope of practice for the profession. A pediatric audiology track (https://pacs.wustl.edu/programs/ doctor-of-audiology/pediatric-audiology-specialization/) is also available. Clinical Experiences Students in the AuD program begin a clinical practicum during the first semester of study, and hands-on experiences become more immersive with each successive semester. These clinical education experiences culminate during the fourth year with a full-time clinical externship. Housed within the Department of Otolaryngology (http://oto.wustl.edu/) in the Washington University School of Medicine, AuD students benefit from a wide variety of clinical opportunities across the lifes pan and scope of practice. Students gain experience alongside our medical faculty and clinicians in our nationally ranked teaching hospitals and in a wide variety of on-campus and off-campus clinical sites (https:// pacs.wustl.edu/programs/doctor-of-audiology/clinic/ ). Research Training The integration of research into the curriculum is a distinctive feature of the AuD program. All students receive research training (https://pacs.wustl.edu/programs/doctor-of-audiology/ research-training-opportunities/ ) through course work and the completion of the capstone project during the third year. Students are also encouraged to pursue their individual research interests through a variety of elective interdisciplinary research opportunities, including an elective summer research experience. Master of Science in Deaf Education The Master of Science in Deaf Education (MSDE) (https:// pacs.wustl.edu/programs/master-of-science-in-deaf- education/ ) program prepares students as teachers of children who are deaf or hard of hearing (birth to grade 12). The early identification of hearing loss and advanced hearing technologies have increased the national need for teachers with experience in listening and spoken language, creating opportunities for graduates across the country. With origins dating back to 1914, our MSDE program is recognized internationally as one of the most prestigious of its kind. The program's intensive curriculum, emphasis on immersion in practice teaching, and experienced faculty attract students from a wide variety of backgrounds. Curriculum 91Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) The two-year curriculum (https://pacs.wustl.edu/programs/ master-of-science-in-deaf-education/curriculum/) is rooted in the development of speech, language, and social skills. With that foundation in mind, students go on to study the factors necessary for the high-quality education of children who are deaf or hard of hearing. Students learn about and participate in the teaching process, from the first diagnosis and early intervention through family- centered counseling and educational options for the child. Students also learn about assistive listening devices, including digital hearing aids, cochlear implants, frequency modulation systems, and sound field systems. The integration of research into the curriculum is a unique feature of this program. Through course work in the fields of speech and hearing, education, psychology, and deafness, students learn how to be consumers of research and to apply the knowledge gained to their own teaching. Student Teaching Experiences Our students build their knowledge and skills through classroom instruction and immersive student teaching experiences. Teaching experiences are available at a number of local sites, including both public and private schools and the on-campus Central Institute for the Deaf (https://cid.edu/), which collectively serve more than 700 children who are deaf or hard of hearing. Teaching experiences outside of the St. Louis area are also available. In addition, our nationally recognized medical school and hospitals provide unique opportunities, such as observing cochlear implant surgery seminars and touring a hospital neonatal intensive care unit. PhD in Speech and Hearing Sciences The PhD in Speech and Hearing Sciences prepares students for academic and research careers in speech and hearing sciences. Established in 1947, the program operates in collaboration with the Department of Otolaryngology, with its investigations covering the full spectrum of research endeavors, including basic science, applied and clinical science, and clinical outcomes research. The department is among the largest and most heavily funded otolaryngology research groups in the country, consistently ranking among the top nationally in National Institutes of Health funding. Curriculum The curriculum combines interdisciplinary academic course work, teaching experiences, and research training, culminating in a dissertation. Each student's experience is tailored to their individual interests. Teaching ExperiencesTeaching experiences prepare students to become effective teachers and communicators of their discipline and their own research. All PhD students receive training in pedagogy and complete teaching experiences at the introductory and advanced levels under the guidance of a faculty mentor. Research Students immerse themselves in the world-class research environment of Washington University. As they conduct their own original work, they participate in colloquia, Grand Rounds, brown bag seminars, research seminars, journal clubs, and similar opportunities. The program fosters opportunities to publish and participate in professional conferences. During the final year of the program, students present and defend their dissertations. Affiliated Research Affiliated research labs include those focusing on applied, basic, and clinical sciences within otolaryngology. The department also operates one of the nation's largest research programs specifically focusing on hearing and deafness. Visit the Program in Audiology & Communication Sciences website (https://pacs.wustl.edu/ ) for more information. Minor in Speech and Hearing Sciences The Minor in Speech and Hearing Sciences ( http:// bulletin.wustl.edu/undergrad/artsci/speechhearing/#minors) is designed for current undergraduate students interested in exploring topics related to human communication. Course work provides an overview of the fields of hearing, deafness, language and speech, with opportunities to explore related topics in more depth. This minor is especially valuable for students in fields such as psychology, education, philosophy-neuroscience- psychology (PNP) and linguistics, but it has broad applicability for many fields of study. Course work completed as part of this minor can also be used to fulfill prerequisites for graduate studies in audiology, deaf education and speech-language pathology. Biology and Biomedical Sciences 92Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) PhD Degrees in Biology & Biomedical Sciences PhD Degrees Each program has its own steering committee, which provides students with guidance, addresses their needs, and monitors their progress. The committee also helps each student customize the course of study to match their individual needs. Each of the 13 programs establishes its own degree requirements. Across all of the programs, the course of study consists of five distinct parts: Courses This generally requires two to five semesters and usually consists of four to nine courses in areas fundamental to the student's program. Students are expected to maintain a B average in graduate courses. Laboratory Rotations Selecting a thesis advisor is the most important decision a student makes in graduate school. To help each student make an informed, thoughtful choice, the Division builds in flexibility to explore options. Students usually participate in three lab rotations during their first year. Additional rotations can be arranged, and rotation lengths are flexible. Students usually begin their thesis research by the end of their first year. Qualifying Examination After required courses are completed, each student takes a preliminary or qualifying examination to assess their mastery of the field and their ability to integrate information across fields. Upon successful completion of the qualifying exam, the student concentrates on thesis research. Thesis Research Thesis research begins once the student has chosen a laboratory in which to work. With their mentor \u2014 the laboratory's principal investigator \u2014 the student devises a thesis project and chooses an advisory committee. Typically between the end of their second year and the middle of their third year, students present their thesis proposals to the thesis committee. Upon successful approval of the thesis proposal, the student officially becomes a doctoral candidate. For the rest of the student's program of study, the thesis committee monitors progress and meets at least once a year to provide analysis and advice. It also serves as the thesis defense committee when the thesis is ready for presentation. Most students complete and defend their dissertations by the end of their sixth year.Scientific Scholarship Keeping abreast of scientific developments is critical for faculty and students alike. The Division offers many ways to stay current. More than 15 weekly biology seminars provide excellent opportunities to meet outstanding scientists from outside Washington University. Several annual symposia bring internationally recognized speakers to campus. Journal clubs meet weekly for students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty to present and discuss current scientific literature. A number of Interdisciplinary Research Pathways (http:// dbbs.wustl.edu/curstudents/SpecialEmphasisPathways/Pages/ SpecialEmphasisPathways.aspx ) allow students to enhance their PhD program. Program retreats allow for informal interaction among students and faculty. The Division also provides funds for each student for professional development.

Students will gain knowledge and be able to describe crucial considerations in the design of survey samples and cluster- level interventions; relate emerging metrics distinctive to implementation research, including of implementation processes, context, adaptation, and implementation outcomes; and understand pitfalls and opportunities for the use of widely representative non-research data, such as data culled from electronic medical records and administrative databases. On average, scholars complete the certificate requirements within one to two years. All course work must be successfully completed within five years from the start of the first course. Credits cannot be transferred into the program. The evening course format allows for full- or part-time enrollment that can accommodate clinical schedules at any point during a student's career. Genetic Counseling Master of Science in Genetic Counseling Applicants to the Master of Science in Genetic Counseling (MSGC) program must hold a bachelor's degree (or equivalent if from a foreign college or university), and they must have completed prerequisite courses from an accredited college or university. The Program in Genetic Counseling is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Genetic Counseling (ACGC) (https://www.gceducation.org/ ). The ACGC is a member of the 99Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) Association of Specialized and Professional Accreditors (ASPA) (https://aspa-usa.org/ ). The ASPA is dedicated to enhancing quality in higher education through specialized and professional accreditation. The MSGC program prepares students to become certified genetic counselors. In addition to course work, students will complete clinical fieldwork rotations and complete a research project prior to graduation. The MSGC degree program is a 21- month, full-time program. Graduates of the Program in Genetic Counseling will be eligible to sit for the American Board of Genetic Counseling (ABGC) (https://www.abgc.net/ ) certification examination. The School of Medicine has determined that, as a result of its ACGC accreditation, its genetic counseling program curriculum meets the educational requirements needed for graduates to sit for the ABGC Certification Examination and to pursue licensure in all states and territories of the United States and Washington, DC, in which licensure is available. Medical Education Doctor of Medicine Admissions Admission Requirements for the Study of Medicine Entrance requirements for the School of Medicine include the following: 1.Evidence of superior intellectual ability and scholastic achievement; 2.Completion of at least 90 semester units of college courses in an approved college or university; 3.Completion of the Medical College Admission Test of the Association of American Medical Colleges; and 4.Evidence of character and integrity, a caring and compassionate attitude, scientific and humanitarian interests, effective communication skills, and motivation suitable for a career in medicine. Chemistry, physics and mathematics provide the tools for modern biology, for medicine and for the biological basis of patient care. Thus, a firm grounding in these subjects is essential for the study of medical sciences. Entering students are expected to have accomplished at least the equivalent of one-year courses at the undergraduate level in physics and biology; mathematics through calculus; and chemistry, including one year of general or inorganic chemistry and one year of organic chemistry. Course work in biochemistry is encouraged although not required. In addition, one semester of biochemistry can be substituted for one semester of organic chemistry. Similarly, one semester of statistics can be substituted for onesemester of calculus. In selected instances, one or more of these prerequisites may be waived by the Committee on Admissions, but applicants are strongly advised to pursue their interests in these and other areas of science. A major goal of undergraduate college work should be the development of the intellectual talents of the individual. This often involves the in-depth pursuit of some area of knowledge, whether in the humanities, the social sciences or the natural sciences. At the same time, a diversity of background is encouraged in to provide a necessary foundation for the development of cultural awareness, sensitivity and competence. Specific courses (other than the few in the natural sciences) are not prerequisites, because a great variety of courses and life experiences may prepare students for the many roles they may play in their medical careers. The admission requirements for the study of medicine were last reviewed by the Committee on the Oversight Medical Education on May 2, 2022.

Accreditation The Washington University School of Medicine's MD program is nationally accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education ( LCME (https://www.aamc.org/services/first- for-financial-aid-officers/lcme-accreditation/ )). The LCME is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education as an accrediting agency for medical education programs leading to the MD degree. Most state boards of licensure require that applicants graduate from a U.S. medical school accredited by the LCME as a condition for licensure. In addition, most state boards of licensure require that U.S. applicants take and pass the United States Medical Licensing Examination ( USMLE (https:// www.usmle.org/ )). For U.S. medical students to be eligible to sit for the USMLE, their school must be accredited by the LCME. Graduates of LCME-accredited schools are also eligible for residency programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education ( ACGME (https:// www.acgme.org/ )). The School of Medicine has determined that, as a result of its LCME accreditation, its MD program curriculum meets the educational requirements to sit for the USMLE and to pursue licensure and certification in all states and territories of the United States and Washington, DC. For Students Entering the MD Program in July 2020 or After: The Gateway Curriculum ensures that students are not only exceptional physicians but that they are also prepared to lead the transformational changes needed to improve the future of health care delivery and the understanding of health and social determinants of health. The curriculum will include three phases. Phase 1 Phase 1 will consist of 62 total weeks of curricular time: 1 week of orientation, 46 weeks of Integrated Science Foundational Modules, 9 weeks of Clinical Immersions, 4 weeks of the EXPLORE Immersion, and 2 weeks of Phase 1 Capstone. The Integrated Foundational Science Modules will present core science content in fundamental areas (basic, clinical, social, behavioral, and health system sciences). The Clinical Immersions consist of clinical experiences that are authentic, varied in content, and appropriate for the student's level of 102Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) ability. Every student will have an immersion in each of the following areas: inpatient, ambulatory, and procedural. There will be substantial emphasis on professional identity formation and the social, behavioral, and health systems sciences. The EXPLORE Immersion element of the curriculum will focus on four key areas: research, education, advocacy/global health, and innovation. Phase 2 Phase 2 will include 12 months (48 weeks) of clinical clerkship experiences in the content areas of Internal Medicine, Neurology, Obstetrics & Gynecology, Pediatrics, Psychiatry, and Surgery. Each clerkship will begin with one week of specialty- specific foundational science that consists of the purposeful reiteration and expansion of prior material and new material. This material will be taught in a \"signs and symptoms\" framework in order to facilitate core knowledge transfer to clinical reasoning. Each clerkship will end with one week dedicated to assessment, reflection, coaching, and communities (ARCC). Phase 3 Phase 3 will consist of 64 weeks total. Students will engage in 32 weeks of required elements that will include a 4-week Internal Medicine Subinternship; three 4-week Advanced Clinical Rotations (ACRs; weeks total); 4-week Keystone Integrated Science Courses (KISCs; 12 weeks total); and 4 weeks of Capstone. In addition, students will take 28 weeks of electives (clinical, research, other non-clinical). Up to 8 of the 28 weeks of elective time may be used for USMLE study, and up to 16 weeks may be used for research. During Phase 3, there are 4 weeks of School of Medicine holiday time, and students may also opt to take up to 4 weeks of unscheduled (no credit) time. For Students Entering the MD Program Prior to July 2020: The curriculum includes a core experience based upon a sequence of courses that introduces students to the many domains and disciplines of medicine. The principles, methods of investigation, problems and opportunities in each of the major disciplines of medical science and medical practice are presented in such a way as to help students select the career best suited to their abilities and goals. Through all four years of the curriculum, key topics known as Threads are woven throughout the learning experience, linking clinical and course work and enhancing the learning experience. The preclinical curriculum provides a science and investigative foundation for future clinical practice. First-year and second- year course work combines basic science taught via a variety of didactic means, including lectures, small groups, simulations and case-based learning. It also includes a Practice of Medicinecourse that uses regular patient interactions and integrative cases to teach students to skillfully interview and examine patients while integrating current health disparities and issues in the present global spectrum. In addition, students have the opportunity during their first year to complete four 10-hour selective courses in the humanities, the basic sciences, and various clinical areas, which provides enrichment and in-depth focus on areas beyond the core curriculum. The preclinical curriculum is pass/fail. The overall goal of the third year is the implementation of the fundamental interactive clinical skills necessary for the practice of medicine at the highest possible level of excellence. Students achieve this goal by participating in intensive, closely supervised training experiences in the core clinical clerkships, which involve inpatient and ambulatory settings and interactions with patients who present a spectrum of emergent, urgent, routine and chronic clinical problems. Through these experiences, students exhibit growth and maturation in their abilities to take medical histories, perform complete physical examinations, synthesize findings into a diagnosis, formulate treatment plans, and document and present information in a concise, logical and organized fashion. During the final year of the medical school curriculum, the required elective program helps students to decide where their major interests lie. It also enables them to benefit from the wide range of specialized knowledge and skills found in the faculty, and it lays the foundation for lifelong learning and the application of principles. The elective program permits students to select, according to their desires, the areas that they wish to explore or to study in depth. The fourth year also offers students the opportunity to synthesize the learning from the third year in preparation for clinical residency. Toward this end, students are required to complete a Capstone course prior to graduation.

Interdisciplinary Courses Return to Doctor of Medicine Core Courses (p. 104) M80 InterDis 799 Selective Clerkship 105Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) M80 InterDis 807 Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation The elective is designed to provide the student with a broad introduction to the field of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. Major objective of this clinical elective is to achieve greater knowledge of the neurological and musculoskeletal diseases and their treatment, and gain understanding of basic principles of rehabilitation. The student will learn the clinical and rehabilitative care of patients with strokes, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord trauma and diseases, and limb amputations. Student will gain clinical skills in evaluating in management of functional impairments. Students will be expected to participate in daily rounds on inpatient rehabilitation units with the clinical care team, follow 3-5 patients, attend multidisciplinary team conferences and family meetings, attend outpatient rehabilitation clinics in spinal cord, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and amputee. Teaching and supervision is provided by the physiatry and neurology faculty of the Division of Rehabilitation. Rehabilitation and neurology residents are involved in student teaching as well. Students are required to participate in didactic teaching conferences within the PM&R residency. This rotation is particularly useful for students considering careers in rehabilitation, neurology, geriatrics, primary care, neurosurgery, or any other field that will require experience in the evaluation and management of patients with physical impairment and disabilities. M80 InterDis 808 Step Preparation Step Preparation. M80 InterDis 809 Ambulatory Care - Jacqueline Maritz Lung Center The Jacqueline Maritz Lung Center houses the ambulatory care activities of the Divisions of Pulmonary Medicine, Thoracic Surgery, and Allergy/Immunology, as well as the pulmonary function laboratory. The student will rotate through: 1. both general pulmonary and subspecialty clinics in Pulmonary Medicine (cystic fibrosis, transplantation, emphysema, etc.), 2. the Thoracic Surgery clinic, and 3. the Allergy/Immunology clinic. Students will also interpret pulmonary function tests. Chest imaging is also emphasized in the evaluation process. The rotation can be streamlined to meet areas of emphasis desired by individual students. M80 InterDis 827 Introduction to Global Health This is a cross-disciplinary \"crash course\" in global health for students considering a career in global health and should be particularly useful for those students planning to complete international electives before graduation or during residency. The course consists of a mix of lectures, workshops, discussions, debates, laboratory sessions, clinics, and simulation labs for two weeks. Topics will include significant coverage of high- burden infectious and tropical diseases (primarily case-based) in addition to discussion of emerging and neglected global health topics including mental health, non-communicable diseases, radiology, and maternal health. Active participation in all activities and discussions is expected in order to obtain credit for this course. The course is team taught by faculty from around the medical school with extensive experience in global health and will include opportunities to network with faculty and residents actively engaged in clinical, research, policy, and implementation work around the world. This course has been run for two years previously for residents only and now is being opened up to senior medical students as well. No specific clinical requirementsor call is required. Attendance and active participation for each session throughout the two weeks is required and students should not schedule residency interviews or other time off during this block. M80 InterDis 829 Biomedical Innovation and Entrepreneurship This four-week course will be offered once during the year, from Weeks 25 through 28. The course will serve as both a primer for students interested in medical technology and biotechnology development as well as a hands-on opportunity for them to work directly with teams engaged in clinical problem solving and product development. Students will learn the basics of developing a business plan, market analysis, clinical needs assessment, and project design. Students will split their time between working with an IDEA Labs team, performing independent research, and completing educational modules. During the portion of the year that this course is offered, IDEA Labs teams are beginning to develop solutions to clinical problems. During this process, the teams need to reach out to the clinical community for input on clinical needs and marketability. Fourth-year medical students will work with one IDEA Labs team to help complete the clinical needs assessment and market analysis portions of their business model. They will do this by both reaching out to clinicians and performing the research necessary to complete these portions of the business model. Fourth-year medical students are uniquely qualified to help with the clinical needs assessment given their experiences, clinical knowledge, and connections from their third year of medical school. In addition, during this time, students will also be expected to complete a \"passport\" of online and hands-on learning modules from an assortment provided by IDEA Labs from which the student may choose. The lectures will consist of online/in-person lectures outlining business development, clinical needs assessment, market analysis, and product development. The hands-on experiences will consist of 3D printing/prototyping and an open-source, single-board microprocessor workshop. Students are not expected to master any one facet of this experience; instead, this course is intended to introduce students to some of the thought processes and techniques behind moving from a clinical problem to a market ready product. Learning Objectives: By the end of this course, students should be able to do the following: (1) Perform a clinical needs assessment of a proposed solution to a clinical problem, including clearly defining the problem at hand, researching current solutions, designing and implementing a needs-based survey, and obtaining expert opinion and consultation. (2) Perform a preliminary market analysis of a proposed solution to a clinical problem, including estimates of market size, market trends, market growth rate, market profitability, industry cost structure, distribution channels, key success factors, key success details, and a SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) of the proposed solution and IDEA Labs team/business as a whole. (3) Participate and engage in clinical problem identification and solution validation. (4) Print a small 3D object using modern, commercially available 3D printing techniques. This course will be graded on a pass/fail basis. There will be no exam, and the following criteria will be used to determine the final grade: submission of a clinical needs assessment and a market analysis; demonstration of completed passport of experiences, and self-assessment involving the completion of a survey at the beginning and the end of the course reflecting on the knowledge gained during the course. 106Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) M80 InterDis 831 One Health; Comparative and Ecological Medicine In this elective, medical students will analyze and evaluate their roles as practitioners of One Health: the collaborative, multisectoral, and transdisciplinary approach to health that optimizes health outcomes by recognizing the interdependence among people, animals, plants and their shared environment. Students will explore human and animal health overlaps from the perspective of ecological health, and comparative anatomy and pathology. They will also have the chance to learn first- hand from veterinarians and animal health experts the extent to which human health is dependent on the close connections we have to the health of animals and our ecosystems.

Population Health Sciences Master of Population Health Sciences The MD/MPHS provides medical students with an opportunity to supplement their clinical training and course work with a quantitative approach to population health science research. Students develop core skills in epidemiology and biostatistics, and these can be applied to research in any clinical field, from primary to specialty care. The program is intended for medical students who plan to incorporate clinical or population health research into their clinical careers, including clinical effectiveness and outcomes research. The program is not restricted to Washington University medical students; students from other medical schools are encouraged to apply. The program combines the traditional medical school curriculum with one additional year of full-time study for the MPHS degree. This added year is typically taken after the second or third year of medical school. Requirements Program Format The MPHS program is offered in a full-time, 10-month format. A minimum of 12 credit units is required for full-time student status, and the maximum course load is 18 credit units per semester. Part-time study options are available.Core MPHS Courses Code Title Units PHS 510 Introduction to SAS for Clinical Research *1 PHS 501 Introduction to Epidemiology 3 PHS 502 Intermediate Epidemiology 3 PHS 511 Introductory Biostatistics for Clinical Research3 PHS 512 Intermediate Biostatistics for Clinical Research3 PHS 505 Ethics in Population and Clinical Health1 PHS 500 Current Topics in Public Health (medical students only)1 *Students with previous SAS experience may opt out of this required class by taking the final exam. Students who receive a 90% or higher on the exam will be exempt from taking the course. Information about elective courses is available on the MPHS website (http://www.mphs.wustl.edu/). Public Health Master of Public Health Applicants should be in the third year of their medical school program. Prior to entering the MPH program, students should have taken courses (up to 11 credit units) that count toward the MPH degree. The MD/MPH provides medical students with an opportunity to supplement their clinical training with courses and experiences designed to create transdisciplinary competencies related to the improvement of population health. Students learn the basics of public health from the foundations courses. MD/MPH students can also choose from a wide variety of Transdisciplinary Problem-Solving Courses (two are required), and they will participate in small-group public health discussions in Public Health Seminar. The faculty and staff at the Brown School will help guide students toward relevant practicum experiences. At the end of the MPH program, MD/MPH students will complete a two-part capstone course. The capstone course culminates in a learning experience that demonstrates synthesis of foundational and specialized competencies. In addition to completing their course work at Brown, all graduating students are required to sit for the Certification in Public Health exam. Students passing the exam will enter the workforce with CPH credentials that indicate their knowledge of and commitment to the field. 116Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) Requirements Program Format Medical students will spend their fourth year in the MPH program. The MD/MPH curriculum comprises three full-time semesters of course work (summer, fall, and spring) at the Brown School, followed by the MPH practicum and capstone project. Students will meet the 52 required credit units with the 11 credits earned in the MD program, 40 credits earned at the Brown School, and 1 additional credit earned in either program.

The clinical practice of anesthesiology includes the following: 1.Assessment of, consultation for and preparation of patients for anesthesia and surgery; 2.Provision of insensibility to pain during surgical, obstetric, therapeutic and diagnostic procedures; 3.Monitoring and restoration of physiologic homeostasis during the perioperative period as well as homeostasis in the critically ill or seriously injured patient; 4.Diagnosis and treatment of painful syndromes; and 5.Clinical management and teaching of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The realm of scientific investigation in anesthesiology also spans a broad range. Scientific efforts at the cellular and molecular levels are directed toward understanding the molecular mechanisms of anesthesia and analgesia. Clinical research in anesthesia includes broad epidemiological approaches to identifying indicators of outcome as well as prospective clinical studies examining new technologies, anesthetic agents and methods. The Department of Anesthesiology (http://anest.wustl.edu) presents the student with the opportunity to do the following: 1.Acquire and apply pharmacologic knowledge related to anesthetic agents, opioids, paralytic and sedative drugs, and drugs affecting the autonomic nervous system; 2.Understand and apply the basic principles of airway management and mechanical ventilation; 3.Understand and apply the principles of cardiopulmonary resuscitation; 4.Understand and apply the technical skills and anatomic and pharmacologic knowledge used in performing regional nerve blocks; 5.Learn and apply the fundamental principles of acute and chronic pain management; and 6.Learn and apply the basic principles of critical care medicine. Anesthesiology bridges the gap between basic science and clinical medicine. It provides experience with the clinical evaluation and management of patients as well as with applied physiology and pharmacology. The Department of Anesthesiology offers student experiences in the operating room, the intensive care unit, the pain management clinic and the laboratory.

Courses Visit online course listings to view offerings for M10 Anesth (https://courses.wustl.edu/CourseInfo.aspx?sch=M&dept=M10). M10 Anesth 805 Anesthesiology This clinical elective is designed to familiarize the student with basic aspects of anesthesiology practice. The primary teaching method is patient care in a clinical setting (one-on-one). The student will learn the basics of preoperative evaluation of surgical patients, the use of intraoperative monitoring in patient management and postoperative care. In addition to perioperative care, the student will be exposed to other clinical areas which 128Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) include our pain management clinic, regional anesthesia/acute pain management, cardiothoracic intensive care unit, labor and delivery, pediatric anesthesia, and the Center for Preoperative Assessment and Planning. During the four-week rotation, the student will learn airway management skills, practical perioperative fluid and electrolyte therapy, along with general and regional anesthetic techniques. As an integral part of the anesthesia care team, the student will participate actively in the anesthetic management of surgical patients. The student's specific requests to be assigned to certain types of cases will be honored as time and availability dictate. The rotation will include three clinical simulator sessions using a simulator mannequin for practical management of airway problems, resuscitation, and trauma emergencies. By the end of the rotation, the student should be able to independently (under supervision) provide anesthesia for uncomplicated surgical procedures. M10 Anesth 811 Cardiothoracic Anesthesiology Subinternship This clinical elective offers practical experience in the perioperative assessment and management of surgical patients undergoing cardiothoracic procedures. The student, as an integral part of the cardiothoracic anesthesia team that is composed of faculty members, fellows and residents, will learn basic principles of airway management and lung ventilation, essential aspects of pharmacologic treatment of hemodynamic abnormalities and cardiac dysrhythmias, and management of intraoperative coagulation disturbances. Emphasis will be placed on the interpretation of intraoperative hemodynamic data, echocardiographic finding (TEE), and laboratory results. During this rotation, the student will also gain practical experience in endotracheal intubation as well as the placement of intravenous lines and invasive monitoring lines, including radial artery and pulmonary artery catheters. Students will learn how to use these parameters in clinical decision making during anesthesia. At the conclusion of the rotation, the student will have a better understanding of invasive monitoring and data interpretation, as well as a more systematic approach to the management of intra- and post-operative hemodynamic, pulmonary and coagulation abnormalities. The students are expected to attend the didactic sessions of CTA and the Department of Anesthesiology. A presentation will be assigned. M10 Anesth 812 Pediatric Anesthesiology This clinical elective is designed to teach the theory and practice of pediatric anesthesiology and pain management. It features individualized instruction with faculty who specialize in the perioperative care of pediatric patients. The elective consists of active participation with pediatric anesthesiologists at St. Louis Children's Hospital and St. Louis Shriners Hospital learning pre-anesthetic assessment, the performance of routine anesthetics (which includes instruction and practice in pediatric airway skills), learning other technical skills such as intravenous line placement and the management of post-anesthesia care and pain therapies. The final week may be tailored to meet the student's individual interests, needs and career goals. Possibilities include exposure to sedation and anesthesia for procedures outside of the operating rooms, and to subspecialties including cardiovascular anesthesia, neurosurgical anesthesia, and acute and chronic pediatric pain management. Students also will have an opportunity to learn the management of some common medical emergencies in the Clinical Simulation Center.M10 Anesth 819 Cardiothoracic Critical Care Subinternship This clinical elective offers practical experience in the postoperative management of cardiothoracic patients. The student will be fully integrated into one of the intensive care teams and have the opportunity to contribute to the management of critically ill patients. Students will have the opportunity to follow specific patients over the course of their stay in the ICU, during which time they will gain insight into holistic management of patients with multi-organ dysfunction. The CTICU environment is both challenging and exciting. Students will gain unique insight into cardiorespiratory physiology and pharmacology which will be demonstrated at the patients' bedside, an invaluable and unforgettable learning experience. Students will have opportunities to learn and sometimes assist with procedures, such as central lines, chest tubes, bronchoscopy and pulmonary artery catheter insertion as well as bedside ultrasound including TTE and TEE. Principles of management and resuscitation of hemodynamically unstable patients following surgery will be emphasized as well as ventilator management. Students will also see and help manage patients with unique physiology such as those patients on ventricular assist devices, and on ECMO. We also have a very busy and heart and lung transplantation program at the hospital - all of these patients are cared for in the CTICU. At the conclusion of the rotation, the student will have a better understanding of shock, sepsis, multi-organ failure, organ system support and compassionate withdrawal of life support. In addition to bedside teaching, there will be informal teaching sessions on a wide variety of topics as well as teaching on interpreting hemodynamic data and waveforms, and cardiac echo exams. Students will be encouraged to present on their patient at morning rounds, during which constructive feedback and interactive teaching will occur. Medical students will be asked to present a short discussion on a topic of their choice. This should be a short 20 - 30 minute presentation followed by a discussion on the topic which will be moderated by the attending. Discuss the time and topic of choice with the attending of service. M10 Anesth 820 Critical Care Subinternship Students on this rotation are integral members of the multidisciplinary intensivist-led critical care team in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU). Students learn an organ systems- based approach for evaluation and management of critically ill and injured patients, and application of evidence-based principles in delivery of state-of-the-art critical care. Emphasis is placed on critical care knowledge and techniques used at the bedside in the clinical management of serious traumatic and surgical conditions. Students become familiar with resuscitation and cardiopulmonary support, including methods for non- invasive and invasive hemodynamic monitoring, and techniques for airway management and pulmonary support in respiratory failure. Basic knowledge and skills in the management of blunt and penetrating trauma, neurologic injuries, multi-system organ failure, and life-threatening infections in the surgical patient are also taught, as is the importance of treatments to alleviate anxiety and pain, maintain fluid and electrolyte balance, and providing adequate nutrition. Practical experience is gained in placement of vascular access devices, airway equipment, ultrasonography and its applications, interpretation of imaging and laboratory data, and use of guidelines, protocols and quality assurance tools in the management of critically ill patients. 129Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) M10 Anesth 821 Pain Management Acute pain is the most common symptom of medical illness and is ubiquitous after major surgery. Chronic pain is the leading cause of worker disability. Severe pain afflicts most people with advanced cancer. Learning the fundamentals of pharmacologic, interventional, and multidisciplinary pain management is important for all areas of clinical medicine. M10 Anesth 822 Anesthesiology for Neurosurgery Subinternship Students will help care for patients having challenging neurosurgical procedures. Students will become familiar with complex procedures, brain monitoring, cardiovascular support and airway management and will be exposed to all kinds of neurosurgical pathology. Student must be prepared to participate in the intricate anesthetic management of patients undergoing surgery in our novel intraoperative MRI rooms. For those interested, clinical research projects are ongoing and student participation is encouraged.

Piston, PhD 4912 South Building Phone: 314-362-9121 The intracellular and intercellular dynamics of cells within the islets of Langerhans play a key role in the regulation of blood glucose levels. The islets are made up of different cell types, but very little is known about the interplay between the different cell types and how this affects their secretion of various hormones. The islets' a-cells secrete insulin in response to increased blood sugar and also in response to neurotransmitters and hormones. Glucagon also plays a key role in blood glucose homeostasis, and it is secreted by the islets' a-cells. High glucose levels inhibit glucagon secretion from a-cells within the islets but not from dispersed a-cells, and the mechanism underlying this phenomenon has not been defined. We use quantitative live cell microscopy to measure single-cell parameters within intact islets held within microfluidic devices in order to expose them to spatially heterogeneous levels of various stimuli. The resulting data are fit using mathematical models of islet functional dynamics, which we are continually modifying to better fit the observed islet physiology. Sheila A.

Peng Yuan, PhD 9608 BJC Institute of Health Phone: 314-747-3793 The focus of this lab is on the structure and function of ion channels and transporters, which play essential roles in human physiology and disease. How do channels and transporters recognize their specific substrate ions? How do they respond to various stimuli, including chemical ligand, temperature, membrane voltage and mechanical force? How do they interact with the lipid membrane where they reside? To answer these fundamental questions, we use multidisciplinary approaches, including X-ray crystallography, biochemistry, biophysics and electrophysiology. Dysfunction of these membrane proteins could lead to a variety of diseases, such as asthma, hypertension, cancer, heart failure, diabetes, chronic pain and many more. The long-term goal is to provide a detailed mechanistic understanding of ion channels and transporters, which will offer novel strategies for drug development and better treatment of diseases.

Department of Developmental Biology The principal research activities of the Department of Developmental Biology are focused on attaining a mechanistic understanding of animal development, encompassing the earliest cell fate specification and movement processes thatshape the early embryo, organogenesis, stem cell biology and engineering, tissue homeostasis and repair, and aging. Students and postdoctoral fellows work closely with faculty and staff on research projects and participate in weekly journal clubs and seminars at which recent literature and ongoing research are discussed. The developmental biology faculty employ a variety of model organisms and cell-based systems to answer key outstanding questions about the fundamental mechanisms of development and to apply this knowledge to pathogenic mechanisms that lead to human birth defects and disease; they also use this knowledge to create improved future therapies. The department takes a broad view of developmental biology, with research groups studying diverse developmental processes (e.g., early embryogenesis, organogenesis, aging) and applying multidisciplinary approaches that include forward and reverse genetics, epigenetics, molecular and chemical methods, and computational methods. Embryogenesis is a fascinating process during which a fertilized egg undergoes divisions to form a mass of pluripotent cells that signal to one another to establish embryonic polarity, diverse cell types, and organs and that also undergo massive cell migrations and rearrangements to sculpt the embryonic body. Research is also carried out on the processes involved in tissue degeneration, repair and regeneration, the biology of embryonic and adult stem cells, and cellular reprogramming. It is a particularly opportune time for developmental biology research, as recent technological breakthroughs in both animal model systems and genomics afford insights into developmental processes at the epigenetic, genetic and molecular levels and also enable the monitoring of cell behaviors in vivo. We are discovering the genes that are responsible for birth defects and defining connections between many adult human diseases and their origins during embryogenesis. The studies of stem cells, cellular reprogramming and regeneration are bringing us closer to curing human diseases, repairing damaged organs, and extending the boundaries of aging.

M20 Genetics 511 Medical Genetics Medical genetics is both a science and a clinical area or specialty of medicine, and the boundary between research and clinical application is increasingly blurred. The pace at which genomic and epigenomic tools are being developed is unprecedented. These tools result in continual conceptual advancements, which inevitably affect how we approach the study of disease risk, diagnosis and management in all areas of medicine, not just medical genetics. We are moving into a time when the interpretable data from the examination of individual genomes will be incorporated to all other clinical data to assess individual risks and guide clinical management and decision making. This course is intended as the first step toward life- long training in medical genetics and genomics. The course begins with a number of sessions devoted to basic principles of genetics. Drawing on this foundation, we move on to discuss genomic and epigenomic tools and to learn from leaders in their fields about the big questions in genetics and genomics (i.e., microbiome research, cancer genomics, current clinical uses of exome sequencing, and so) and how the tools are being used to answer these questions. Students are exposed to the use of genetic and genomic databases and information resources, which will allow them to keep up with new information and critically appraise validity and clinical utility. We begin to discuss the implication of this shift to the \"genomic era,\" particularly regarding ethical aspects, regulatory aspects, equal access, healthcare costs and patient education. Clinical geneticists actively participate in the course and use a series of genetic disorders to help students apply their knowledge, focusing mainly on genetic etiology, pattern of inheritance, inheritance risk and molecular diagnostic testing. Frequent patient interviews further enhance the exposure to clinical genetics. Overall, the course aims to enhance genetic and genomic literacy, which is an essential first step in preparing students to participate in the multidisciplinary teams that effectively make cutting-edge genetic and genomic research results accessible to patients. This course is cross listed with L41 Biol 550. Credit 34 units. M20 Genetics 899 Special Study Genetics Special study opportunities are available in the Department of Genetics.

Milliken Department of Medicine Instruction in medicine is provided during all four years of the medical curriculum, beginning with Practice of Medicine I (Medicine 507) during the first year. Teaching during the second year has two main objectives: (1) the correlation of the basic sciences with clinical aspects of disease; and (2) training in the technical methods of physical examination and laboratory diagnosis. By the beginning of the third year, the student is ready for the supervised clinical study of individual patients. A clinical clerkship of 12 weeks, divided into three four-week periods, is served by third-year students on the medical services of the department. During the final year, students may select a sub- internship in general medicine and a series of elective courses in the medical specialties.

For information about Primary Care Summer Preceptorships (p. 170), please refer to the information at the bottom of this section. John P. Atkinson, MD Clinical Sciences Research Building, 10th Floor Phone: 314-362-8391 A clinical research elective is offered in the evaluation of patients with complement deficiency or overactivity states and with undiagnosed rheumatic disease syndromes. Roberto Civitelli, MD BJC Institute of Health, 11th Floor, Musculoskeletal Research Center Phone: 314-454-8408 Biology of cell-cell interactions and communication in bone via gap junctions and cell adhesion molecules; function of connexins and cadherins differentiation, mechanotransduction; of lineage allocation and osteogenic differentiation by cadherins and beta-catenin signaling. Nicholas O. Davidson, MD 910 Clinical Sciences Research Building, North Tower Phone: 314-362-2027 Our focus is on the genetic pathways of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and colorectal cancer development. We have two major areas of research interest. Our laboratory is interested, first, in the molecular mechanisms of hepatic steatosis and the pathogenesis of NAFLD. This is the most prevalent liver disease in the United States, likely affecting a quarter of the population. We have generated genetically manipulated mouse strains that offer insights into the mechanisms of hepatic steatosis. The student would work as part of a team, designing and conducting experiments that will test hypotheses concerning the mechanisms and consequences of hepatic steatosis. These studies will primarily involve mouse genetics, examining the expression of candidate genes under a variety of nutritional and pharmacologic settings that modulate hepatic lipid metabolism. In addition, we are using microarrays to study the spectrum of genetic changes that may predict the extent of hepatic lipid accumulation in patients with steatohepatitis. Our goal is to test hypotheses using mouse genetics and to extend these studies to examine the same 167Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) pathways in humans with NAFLD. Our second area of interest concerns the genetic pathways involved in colorectal cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. We have developed a novel strain of mice in which the dominant effects of mutations in the APC tumor suppressor gene have been abrogated through deletion of an RNA binding protein, apobec-1. This deletion has a major effect on the expression of cox-2, abrogating the increase in expression seen in human colonic adenomas and wild-type mouse intestinal adenomas. These findings suggest that apobec-1 is a genetic modifier of colon cancer development. We will study the importance of apobec-1 expression in human colon cancer specimens and continue our murine genetic studies of this novel pathway for modulating colon cancer development and progression. Bradley Evanoff, MD, MPH Phone: 314-454-8638 Our primary interest is on occupational medicine epidemiology and intervention research. Our research involves the use of epidemiology methods to characterize associations between diseases and work-related exposures. We are also doing workplace intervention studies to prevent injuries and illnesses and to improve healthy diet and physical activity among working populations. During an elective in occupational medicine epidemiology research, students will learn how to use epidemiologic methods to investigate disease processes by working on a mutually agreed-on topic of interest related to occupational diseases. Other activities can include worksite visits and intervention projects as well as involvement with worksite health promotion and policy making. Elective length is variable, depending on individual circumstances. Please contact Dr. Evanoff to discuss this research. Gregory I. Goldberg, PhD Wohl Clinic, 4th Floor Phone: 314-362-8172 Role of secreted extracellular matrix metalloproteases in tissue remodeling; structure and function of the metalloproteases. Richard W. Gross, MD, PhD 4525 Scott Avenue, East Building Phone: 314-362-2690 Lipid mediators of signal transduction in the cardiovascular system; characterization of regulatory mechanisms responsible for the liberation of lipid second messengers during cellular activation; roles of phospholipases in mediating the metabolic syndrome and end-organ tissue damage. PhD Phone: 314-362-8070 houses@wustl.eduLisa Hayes Phone: 314-362-4362 hayesl@wustl.edu Emergency medicine clinical research is the primary focus of this lab. This type of research involves the gamut of research designs, from retrospective cohort studies (\"The Use of B Hydroxy Butyrate Point-of-Care Testing in Diabetic Ketoacidosis\") to prospective clinical trials (\"Biomarkers in Traumatic Brain Injury\") to the evaluation of health care systems and emergency department processes (\"Effects of a Triage Process Conversion on the Triage of High Risk Presentations\") to the analysis of health policy issues (\"Rate of Follow-up to a Primary Care Clinic and Subsequent Emergency Department Utilization among an Urban ED Population\"). Students will learn the basic clinical research designs and will be able to articulate the benefits and drawbacks of each. They will be involved in hypothesis generation and study design for projects that are at that stage. For ongoing projects, they will learn about the informed consent process and be involved in screening for study subjects and subject selection and enrollment. They will be allowed to consent for studies judged to be of minimal risk. Students will be taught important rules regarding data acquisition and entry, particularly as these relate to standards that have been set forth in the medical literature. They will learn about bias and inter-rater reliability. Students will participate in data entry, data analysis, and subsequent abstract/manuscript preparation based on their level of interest and time commitment. Students will meet weekly with one of the course directors to discuss study progress and to identify any roadblocks to study completion. These meetings will also serve as a forum for one-on-one education of the student regarding study methodology, ethical issues in research, and various resources available to the clinical researcher at Washington University. Sandor J. Kovacs, MD, PhD 9965 Clinical Sciences Research Building Phone: 314-362-8901 This experience is geared toward students with math, physics and engineering backgrounds.

Levin and Rubin (Department of Medicine) investigating the mechanisms underlying the intestinal adaptive response that occurs to compensate for the loss of functional small intestine. A second project focuses on epithelial- mesenchymal interactions and their role in regulating gut 168Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) epithelial proliferation carcinogenesis and the normal and cancer stem cell niche. Specific mechanisms under investigation include the function of an immediate early gene Tis7 on gut adaptation after resection or injury. The role of myofibroblast protein epimorphin in regulating cell proliferation and colon carcinogenesis is being explored. The student will have the opportunity to learn basic molecular biology and physiology as they relate to small intestinal growth and function. Examples of techniques that are used in these studies include small animal surgery and colitis and cancer models (mice and rats), molecular biological techniques including PCR, Northern blotting, vector construction for the production of transgenic and knockout mouse models, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Jason C. Mills, MD, PhD Clinical Sciences Research Building, North Tower, Room 1030 Phone: 314-362-4213 We investigate the differentiation of epithelial stem cells in the upper gastrointestinal tract. We study how genes regulate differentiation in mouse models and in vitro in tissue culture, and we correlate our findings with human tissue specimens. Specific projects include the following: (1) understanding how inflammation leads to aberrant differentiation (metaplasia), which is a precursor for cancer; (2) elucidating how master regulatory transcription factors like Xbp1 and Mist1 coordinate the massive cytoskeletal and organellar expansion of specialized secretory cells as they differentiate from stem cells; and (3) understanding the mechanisms that regulate how differentiated cells can be reprogrammed into stem cells in gastrointestinal organs like the stomach and the pancreas. Richard E. Ostlund, MD 8804 Wohl Hospital Phone: 314-362-8286 Our laboratory focuses on the prevention and treatment of coronary heart disease by studying cholesterol absorption, detoxification and elimination from the body. Direct patient studies that use new stable isotopic cholesterol tracers and mass spectrometry techniques complement in vitro work on the biochemistry of cholesterol transport in cultured cells. Russell Pachynski, MD BJC Institute of Health, 7th Floor Phone: 314-286-2341 Our lab focuses on several aspects of tumor immunology and translational immunotherapy. We utilize mouse tumor models, human tissues and samples, and advanced molecular and immunologic techniques to study leukocyte trafficking in the setting of tumor development and progression. We also have projects focusing on developing novel immunotherapeuticsaimed at augmenting the recruitment of beneficial leukocyte subsets into the tumor microenvironment in order to suppress tumor growth. We are utilizing several approaches, such as nanoparticles, fusion proteins and viruses. Katherine Ponder, MD 8818 Cancer Science Research Building Phone: 314-362-5188 kponder@wustl.edu The focus of this lab is on gene therapy for lysosomal storage diseases such as mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS). We have developed a retroviral vector that can be efficiently delivered to the liver of mice and dogs and that results in expression sufficient to reduce many of the clinical manifestations of these genetic diseases. Current studies focus on assessing the therapeutic effect of gene therapy on sites that are affected in MPS (e.g., heart, aorta, bones, joints) and on developing vectors that might be translated into human patients. In addition, we are evaluating the pathogenesis of disease in MPS, which appears to involve the upregulation of destructive proteases in the aorta and possibly other sites. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of disease might result in additional therapies for MPS. Clay F. Semenkovich, MD Southwest Tower, 8th Floor Phone: 314-362-4454 Fatty acid metabolism and its role in atherosclerosis, diabetes, hypertension and obesity; modulation of respiratory uncoupling for the treatment of aging, obesity and vascular disease. Phyllis K. Stein, PhD Northwest Tower, Room 13116 Phone: 314-286-1350 pstein@wustl.edu This lab's main focus is on the clinical significance of heart rate variability and ECG-derived waveform parameters obtained from continuous ambulatory monitoring. This elective affords the student the opportunity to perform research in heart rate variability or in other measurements, like QT variability or T-wave alternans that can be derived from continuous ECG monitoring from Holter recordings or polysomnography recordings in the sleep lab. One area of active research is the identification of heart rate patterns associated with obstructive and central sleep apneas and hypopneas and the relationship of previously unappreciated cycling heart rate patterns and outcomes. Data are also available from mice. Many possible projects are available using our many large existing datasets, using the thousands of stored studies in the sleep lab, or using de novo data collection in a clinical or animal population and in infants. Also, many possible directions for this research are available, from applying traditional and nonlinear HRV to 169Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) different populations to developing methods to quantify ultradian heart rate variability patterns to developing novel ECG analysis techniques, among others. Also, we are involved with the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), a large population-based longitudinal study of risk factors for heart disease and stroke among community-dwelling people more than 65 years old. There is a subset of this population who had Holter recordings (~1400 at baseline, ~800 of the same people five years later, and ~370 minority subjects recorded at the same time as the second CHS recording). These recordings have already been analyzed by us, so there is a large amount of heart rate variability and heart rate pattern data available. There are also subsets of patients from the CHS and from another study (EPHESUS) who are known to have died suddenly, and we have developed a matched control group in order to examine ECG-based differences in those who died suddenly. We also have electronic sleep studies at two time points for about 300 of the CHS Holter participants who also participated in the Sleep Heart Health Study. We have analyzed an additional ~1500 sleep studies from CHS participants who did not have Holter recordings. Thus, there is also an opportunity in the CHS dataset for studies of the relationship of heart rate variability with changes in heart rate variability over time and with a huge number of clinical and demographic factors among the elderly. We also have data on the relationship of Holter-based HRV and sleep apnea patterns to the development of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery as well as data from a study of the treatment of depression in treatment-resistant depressed post-MI patients, a study of sickle cell patients, and a study of heart rate variability and echo parameters in elderly African Americans. Currently, we are also analyzing HRV in premature infants as they mature and HRV as a predictor of response to treatment in babies in the NICU and PICU, using stored 24-hour bedside ECGs. Heart rate variability and clinical outcomes: The student will be learning about HRV methods and will investigate the relationship of HRV and outcomes in one of our datasets. Because we have clinical and demographic data for about 20,000 subjects for whom continuous ECGs from Holter recordings, sleep studies, and ICU studies are available, as well as some mouse data, the student will be able to choose a project that may lead to a publishable result in an area of interest. The HRV Lab has enough computers and software to accommodate the needs of any interested students.

The emphasis will be on direct contact between the asthmatic patients and the student, along with an asthma counselor. Biology of pollen and fungal allergens: Our laboratory has been characterizing the important allergenic proteins from molds and pollen. The allergens are identified using skin-test-sensitive individuals, and the proteins are isolated and characterized by a combination of physiochemical and molecular biological techniques. These studies should lead to better forms of allergy immunotherapy. Students will participate in the isolation, characterization and modification of major allergens from a number of molds, including Stachybotrys atra and Epicoccum nigrum, and from several pollens, including those from white oak and Parthenium hysterophoros, a newly recognized allergen. Primary Care Summer Preceptorships Since 1996, the School of Medicine has sponsored a primary care preceptorship program for medical students during the summer between their first and second years of classes. Students select a preceptor in internal medicine, pediatrics or family practice and spend up to eight weeks observing that physician's clinical practice. A stipend is provided to the student. Although many of the preceptors are in St. Louis, others \u2014 particularly alumni \u2014 are located in cities throughout the country.

M25 Medicine 831 Pediatric Dermatology This clinical rotation will be available to students interested in dermatology, pediatrics or both. Students will follow the dermatology rotation (M25 830) with an emphasis on pediatric dermatology by attending pediatric dermatology clinics, seeing consults, etc. M25 Medicine 834A SNHC Clinical Mentoring This elective is designed to develop the teaching and mentoring skills of our fourth-year medical students through clinic sessions at the Saturday Neighborhood Clinic. In addition, the elective will develop the ability of our fourth-year students to productively engage and present complex social issues through the development of a one-hour lecture. Three mentoring sessions will also occur. Each fourth-year student will pair with a preclinical (first- or second-year) student each session and then supervise that student throughout the clinic day. The fourth-year student will supervise and assist as the preclinical students completes the patient history and physical, presents the exam results to the physician, and writes the visit notes for multiple patients. The preclinical student will complete one patient note without assistance, which the fourth-year student will then thoroughly review, edit, and return to the preclinical student, along with constructive feedback regarding the preclinical student's general performance. The attending present at the SNHC will verify that the fourth-year mentor fulfilled the specified mentoring requirements. Additional practice sessions to review exam skills, note writing, and communication are optional and can be individually arranged between teams so the fourth-year mentor can assist the first-year student with personalized skills. Reading: (1 presentation) The fourth- years taking this elective will break into groups of 3-4. Each group will be responsible for presenting a 1-hour presentation on a topic related to \"social determinants of health\". There should be a case component to the presentation as well as a broader discussion. The presentations will be based on thorough research and should engage the broader context of the topic including the epidemiology, social and health ramifications, economics, interventions, et c. The presentation should include descriptions of potential solutions and innovation, where applicable. 174Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) M25 Medicine 836 Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology The GI Hepatology elective is integrated into a very active inpatient and endoscopy service at Barnes-Jewish Hospital.

Scott J. Hultgren, PhD McDonnell Pediatric Research Building, 10th Floor Phone: 314-362-6772 Our focus is on the pathogenic mechanisms and disease outcomes in the urinary tract. Work in the Hultgren lab blends multiple scientific disciplines to elucidate bacterial and host mechanisms that determine the onset, course and outcome of interactions between a host mucosal surface and bacterial pathogens. Using genetics, genomics, biochemistry, structural biology, high-resolution imaging, animal models, clinical studies and combinatorial chemistry, we have illuminated new ways in which intracellular lifestyles and community behavior play critical roles in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection. We have uncovered new principles of adhesive pili biogenesis in gram- negative bacteria by the chaperone/usher pathway, delineating the fine molecular details of a donor strand complementation and exchange mechanism by which the energy of final subunit folding is used to complete the assembly and extrusion of pili across the outer membrane. We revealed how uropathogenic Escherichia coli use type 1 pili to invade and establish biofilm- like intracellular bacterial communities within bladder cells as part of a mechanism that subverts host defenses and how quiescent intracellular reservoirs can seed recurrent infections. We have uncovered complex networks that govern mucosal epithelial response to infection, which we have shown determines disease outcome. Further, we have made seminal contributions to our understanding of the pathogenesis and response to other uropathogens, polymicrobial infections and catheter-associated UTIs and to the mechanisms by which bacteria form a directed amyloid fiber, curli, which is important in biofilm formation. Together, this work is changing the way UTIs are evaluated, reshaping models of bacterial infections in general and spawning new technologies to design novel vaccines and antimicrobial therapeutics to diagnose, treat and/or prevent UTIs and their sequelae. Christina L. Stallings, PhD McDonnell Pediatric Research Building, 8th Floor Phone: 314-286-0276Our main focus is the molecular pathogenesis of mycobacteria. Our laboratory integrates in vivo disease modeling, molecular biology and biochemistry to provide answers to the fundamental biological questions regarding molecular pathogenesis and to yield therapeutic strategies for the treatment of mycobacterial infections. Joseph P. Vogel, PhD McDonnell Pediatric Research Building, 10th Floor Phone: macrophages by preventing phagosome-lysosome fusion. David Wang, PhD McDonnell Pediatric Research Building, 8th Floor Phone: 314-286-1123 Our work focuses on the discovery and characterization of novel viruses. We use functional genomic technologies to identify novel viruses from a variety of clinical samples from diseases of unexplained etiology. We then use epidemiologic, molecular and cellular strategies to define the relevance of newly identified viruses to human disease. A range of new viruses \u2014 including polyomaviruses, astroviruses and picronaviruses \u2014 are currently under investigation. Sean P.J. Whelan, PhD McDonnell Pediatric Research Building, 9th Floor Phone: 314-286-1585 The Whelan Lab research focus is on the molecular mechanisms that underpin gene expression in nonsegmented negative-strand (NNS) RNA viruses \u2014 a group of viruses that includes some of the most significant human pathogens in existence (e.g., rabies, ebola, respiratory syncytial virus, measles, mumps, Nipah viruses). Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) has served as an important prototype of the NNS RNA viruses for more than 50 years, and Dr. Whelan has played a leading role in this field that can be traced back to the recovery of infectious virus from cDNA. As independent investigators, Dr. Whelan and his colleagues have led the way to understanding the structure and function of the viral replication machinery. The goals of such studies have been to ultimately inform the development of inhibitors against this group of important pathogens and to advance the use of VSV as a vaccine vector, an oncolytic agent, and a neuronal tracer.

Beau Ances, MD Taylor Avenue Building Extension, 2nd Floor Phone: 314-747-8423 Neuroimaging of neurodegenerative disorders. Students can work in a neuroimaging laboratory that is focused on the translational discovery of neuroimaging biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. The laboratory focuses on the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. We are investigating the effects of neurodegenerative diseases on the brain network level usingfunctional (blood oxygen level dependent imaging, arterial spin labeling), structural (volumetrics, diffusion tensor imaging), and metabolic (PET amyloid and tau) methods. Multiple projects that involve bioengineering, neuroimaging and infectious disease are available, depending on the interest of the student. Randall Bateman, MD Biotechnology Center, Room 304 Phone: 314-747-7066 Central nervous system protein metabolism in aging and dementia. This research elective will expose the student to translational research in the study of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. The student will participate in multiple areas of the research, including participant recruitment, consent, enrollment and admission to a research hospital unit. Lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid sample collection, blood collection and intravenous labeling methods will be demonstrated and taught. The student will participate in sample analysis, including processing for mass spectrometry quantitation, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western gel methods. Quantitation, analysis and modeling of the data will be taught in the context of data interpretation and study design. Anne H. Cross, MD, and Laura Piccio, MD, PhD McMillan, 3rd Floor Phone: 314-747-4591 or 314-747-0405 Understanding interactions of the immune system with the central nervous system as it relates to multiple sclerosis and other neuroimmunological disorders. Our goal is to understand how immune cells cross the blood-brain barrier and initiate the cascade of events that leads to the lesions of multiple sclerosis. We are also funded to study the effects of diet and adipokines on neuroinflammation. Depending on the time commitment of the student and their individual interests and goals, they will either assist with ongoing projects or be given a laboratory project on which to work. Projects may involve animal models of multiple sclerosis, cell culture or studies of human samples (cerebrospinal fluid, blood or autopsied specimens). Interested students should contact Dr. Cross (crossa@neuro.wustl.edu) or Dr. Piccio (picciol@neuro.wustl.edu ) several weeks in advance before signing up for this research to allow for sufficient planning. Robert T. Naismith, MD McMillan, Room 310B Phone: 314-747-0432 Clinical imaging research in multiple sclerosis. The student will learn about neuroimaging, imaging analyses, data collection, data management and clinical study endpoints in multiple sclerosis. They will observe patient participants undergoing a detailed evaluation of disability measures, such as ambulation, symptom scales, cognition, vision, upper extremity function, and so on. They will witness the entire process of image acquisition, 195Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) processing, analysis and data extraction. They will have the opportunity to interact with many people who are vital to the research, including research coordinators, imaging technologists, imaging physicists/chemists and specialized research clinicians (i.e., neurocognitive and physical therapy research specialists). The student will assist with hands-on clinical investigative research. They will gain an excellent appreciation of multiple sclerosis, from its pathophysiology within the central nervous system to how it affects the neurological function of individuals. Through detailed and quantitative imaging analysis, the student will become very adept at analyzing brain MRI scans. They will mark and track lesions to determine their effects on clinical function and learn to identify normal-appearing white matter, cortex and gray-matter structures. They will become familiar with Amira Imaging Analysis Software, SPSS Statistical Analysis Software, SIENA Volume Analysis Software and Matlab Imaging Analysis Software. Steven E. Petersen, PhD East Building, Room 2108 Phone: 314-362-3319 This lab is interested in brain organization and function, particularly for language, attention and memory. Our main approach to these issues is through functional MRI and large- scale network analysis. Joel S. Perlmutter, MD East Building, 2nd Floor Phone: 314-362-6026 Pathophysiology of movement disorders. The lab is primarily interested in the etiology, pathophysiology and treatment of basal ganglia disorders. We have several studies of Parkinson disease (PD). We investigate mechanisms of action of deep brain stimulation, which is a dramatic new treatment. These studies combine PET, cognitive testing and quantified measures of movement. We also test new drugs that might rescue injured nigrostriatal neurons (a model of PD). For these, we use PET to measure dopamine pathways and also to quantify motor behavior. We also have an active program developing and validating neuroimaging biomarkers for PD and for determining the integrity of the nigrostriatal pathway that includes studies in human and animal models of PD. We have an active program that combines a variety of approaches to developing biomarkers and investigating the pathophysiology of dementia associated with PD. We use PET to measure radioligand binding and sensorimotor processing in dystonia. We developed a new animal model of dystonia to investigate pharmacologic and physiologic changes. We use PET to investigate drug-mediated pathways in the brain and to parse out the effects of selectivedopaminergic agonists. We are also working to develop MR- based methods including diffusion tensor imaging and resting- state functional connectivity to investigate the brain mechanisms underlying PD and dystonia. Brad A. Racette, MD McMillan, 9th Floor Phone: 314-362-5291 Our lab is primarily interested in environmental risk factors associated with Parkinson's disease. We use a variety of techniques to study these risk factors, including traditional field epidemiology, in which we evaluate workers exposed to metals in the United States and residents living near a smelter in South Africa; neuroimaging, in which we study the pathophysiology of toxin-mediated parkinsonism; geographic information systems research, in which we associate environmental toxin exposures with the incidence and prevalence of Parkinson's disease in the United States and Finland; and neuropathologic studies, in which we evaluate manganese-exposed workers from South Africa. There are numerous opportunities available for students to be involved with any of these projects. Students will receive some clinical exposure as well to familiarize them with pertinent clinical syndromes. Marcus E. Raichle, MD East Building, 2nd Floor Phone: 314-362-6907 This lab investigates in vivo brain hemodynamic, metabolic and functional studies of human cognition and emotion using cyclotron-produced isotopes and PET as well as fMRI in humans. Refer also to the listing on this page for Steven E. Petersen, PhD. Gregory Wu, MD, PhD McMillan, 3rd Floor Phone: 314-362-3293 Understanding how immune responses are generated that target the central nervous system. Specifically, this lab studies antigen- presenting cell contributions to autoimmune animal models of multiple sclerosis. Our goal is to understand what cellular interactions are critical to the development of immune-mediated demyelination.

Students considering neurology as a career may also desire additional exposure to supplement their prior clerkship experience. The elective is split into two two-week rotations, which may include the following: (1) Adult Inpatient General Service (with one clinic/week); (2) Adult Inpatient Stroke Service (with one clinic/week); (3) Adult Inpatient Consult Service (with one clinic/week); (4) Pediatric Neurology Consult Service (with one clinic/week); (5) Adult Neurology ICU (with one clinic/week); and (6) Outpatient Clinics (with eight to 10 clinics/week).M35 Neurol 827A Special Elective in Adult Inpatient Clinical Neurology Students This four-week elective for fourth-year visiting students from a US medical school provides the option (space permitting) of four weeks of Adult Inpatient Service (Stroke for 2 weeks, General Neurology for 2 weeks), or two weeks on an Adult Inpatient Service and two weeks on the Adult Consult Service. Students on the inpatient service will function as a subintern under the supervision of their junior resident, chief resident, and attending physician. The student will also attend weekly clinical conferences and a weekly outpatient clinic experience. This elective is suitable for visiting fourth-year students interested in Neurology, who wish to improve their Neurology knowledge and skills. M35 Neurol 830 Neuro-Oncology This elective provides an outpatient-oriented pediatric and adult neuro-oncology experience for fourth-year medical students. Students will: - attend multidisciplinary adult and pediatric neuro-oncology clinics and case conferences (tumor boards), - attend adult and pediatric radiation oncology clinics, - attend neuropathology brain tumor review, - participate in subspecialty brain tumor clinics, and - attend monthly brain tumor research conferences. M35 Neurol 851 Clinical Aspects of Aging and Dementia This elective provides the opportunity to learn about clinical research and clinical care in healthy brain aging and dementia. Students are encouraged to contact the Course Directors (Dr. B. Joy Snider and/or Dr. John Morris) before the elective begins to discuss their interests, as this elective is customized based on student interests. This can be a two-week or four- week elective. Students can gain proficiency in interviewing techniques and in the neurologic examination of the geriatric patient, and are introduced to neuropsychology, neuropathology, biomarkers, neuroimaging, genetics, and other biomedical procedures important in the diagnostic evaluation of older adults. The Knight ADRC is an interdisciplinary group, so students have the opportunity to interact with physicians, nurse clinicians, psychologists, and social workers, and to explore the neuropsychology, neuropathology, biomarkers, neuroimaging, genetics, and other biomedical procedures used in the diagnosis of dementing disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementias, Neurology The Neonatal Neurology elective will consist of a combination of inpatient and outpatient experiences designed to provide medical students with comprehensive exposure to the field. Through the rotation, students will actively participate in all aspects of patient care, acquiring the knowledge and skill necessary to effectively evaluate infants with neurological disorders, including encephalopathy, stroke, seizures, hypotonia, intraventricular hemorrhage, and periventricular leukomalacia, among others. Clinical activities will be tailored to fit the interests and goals of the individual student and include a combination of inpatient and outpatient exposures. Inpatient activities will occur in the St. Louis Children's Hospital Neonatal Intensive Unit as part of the Neonatal Neurology Consultation service. Outpatient activities 197Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) will occur in the St. Louis Children's Hospital Outpatient Clinics. Students will also attend educational conferences specific to the field during the rotation, including Neonatal Neurology Clinical Conference and Neonatal Neuroradiology Conference. M35 Neurol 860 Pediatric Neurology The senior elective experience in child neurology is designed to adapt to the individual goals and objectives of students. The elective takes place in one or two 2-week blocks that occur among five possible venues as chosen by the student: 1. Outpatient clinics, 2. Inpatient ward service, 3. Inpatient general consult service, 4. NICU consult service, and 5. Video EEG (VEEG) monitoring service. The combination of services and experiences will be arranged directly between the student and the Course Director prior to beginning the rotation. In the outpatient clinics, students will rotate between a variety of subspecialty clinics and work with a variety of attendings in order to experience the breadth of outpatient pediatric neurology. Students rotating on the inpatient ward service will have a different role than the third-year student on pediatrics. The fourth-year student will focus solely on neurology patients and work closely with the pediatric neurology resident to develop neurology-specific care plans. No call or weekend duties will be expected on this rotation. On the general consult services, students will work with the consult attending and pediatric neurology residents on that team to see consults in the PICU, CICU, ER, and other hospital floors. The NICU consult team focuses on infants in the NICU. Student rotating on the VEEG monitoring service will focus on learning the indications and uses of VEEG and basic EEG reading skills M35 Neurol 861 Neurointensive Care Unit The student will be integrated into the Critical Care Team that provides care in the Neurology/Neurosurgery ICU. Diseases frequently encountered include intracerebral hemorrhage, head trauma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, spinal cord disease, and neuromuscular disease.. The student will follow patients, participate in rounds and pay participate in some procedures under supervision. Didactic sessions will be provided as conferences or lectures from the ICU attending and fellow. M35 Neurol 865 Adult and Pediatric Epilepsy Students will learn how epileptologists diagnose and manage epilepsy in adults and children. They will learn how to use the history and physical exam and laboratory studies such as EEG, MRI, PET, and SPECT to diagnose and manage patients with new onset epilepsy, established epilepsy, and medically intractable epilepsy. They will become familiar with the medical management of epilepsy as well as the treatment options for medically intractable epilepsy including surgery, the vagus nerve stimulator, and the ketogenic diet. They will also learn how to manage the co-morbid conditions that accompany epilepsy such as depression, behavioral problems, cognitive impairment, sleep disturbance, and non-epileptic events. Students will accomplish these goals by attending epilepsy clinics and rounding on the inpatient epilepsy service with the epilepsy team at Barnes- Jewish Hospital and St. Louis Children's Hospital. They will attend the Adult Epilepsy Conference, the Pediatric Epilepsy Conference, and Neurology Grand Rounds. Students will also have the opportunity to observe epilepsy surgery if they wish. They will have the option to present one 15-30 minute talk on a topic relevant to epilepsy.M35 Neurol 872 MS Center/Outpatient - Missouri Baptist Students will develop their skills in taking histories and performing neurological examinations on patients with multiple sclerosis under direct supervision of multiple sclerosis specialists. Localization of neurological findings and symptoms to the neuro-axis will be emphasized. A major goal for the students will to increase the understanding of comprehensive patient management including disease treatment, symptom management, adjunctive therapy services, and psychosocial issues. The outpatient rotation will be four weeks at The MS Center for Innovations in Care at Missouri Baptist Medical Center with Dr. Barry Singer and Dr. Mark Tullman. An additional goal for students will be to understand process of clinical research and translation into approved therapies. The center has been a leader in clinical trial development of therapeutics that have been or will soon be FDA-approved as new medications for multiple sclerosis.

Courses M05 Neurosci 810 Advanced Dissection Students will perform detailed dissections on a discrete region of the body of their choosing-i.e. head/neck, thorax, abdomen, pelvic cavity, or limbs. Students will compile a list of personal learning objectives with the approval of the course director(s). A minimum of 30hrs of self-paced individual dissection is required and may include practice of surgical approaches, and/or study of cross-sectional anatomy and medical imaging. L41 Biol 5571 Cellular Neurobiology This course will present a fully integrated overview of nerve cell structure, function and development at the molecular and cellular level. Broad topics to be covered include gene structure and regulation in the nervous system, quantitative analysis of voltage- and chemically-gated ion channels, presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms of chemical neurotransmission, sensory transduction, neurogenesis and migration, axon guidance and synapse formation. Two lectures plus one hour of discussion per week for 14 weeks. There will be three exams, as well as homework problems and summaries of discussion papers. Prerequisites: graduate standing or permission of the instructor. Credit 6 units. L41 Biol 5622 Cognitive, Computational, and Systems Neuroscience Project Building The goal of this course is to help students in the CCSN Pathway develop the critical thinking skills necessary to develop and implement high quality, interdisciplinary research projects. Throughout the course of the semester, each student will develop a research plan in their chosen area of interest. The plan will be developed in consultation with at least two faculty members (from at least two different subdisciplines within the pathway) as well as the other students and faculty participating in the course. The culmination of this course will be for each student to produce an NIH-style grant proposal on the research project of their choosing. For most students, this will serve either as their thesis proposal or a solid precursor to the thesis proposal. The course will be designed to help facilitate the development of such a research plan through didactic work, class presentations, class discussion, and constructive feedback on written work. The course will begin with a review of written examples of outstanding research proposals, primarily in the form of grant submissions similar to those that the students are expected to develop (i.e., NRSA style proposals, R03 proposals). Review of these proposals will serve as a stimulus to promote discussion about the critical elements of good research proposals and designs in different areas. Each student will be expected to give three presentations throughout the semester that will provide opportunities to receive constructive feedback 203Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) on the development and implementation of research aims. The first presentation (towards the beginning of the semester) will involve presentation of the student's general topic of interest and preliminary formulation of research questions. Feedback will emphasize ways to focus and develop the research hypotheses into well-formulated questions and experiments. The second presentation will involve a more detailed presentation of specific research questions (along the lines of NIH-style Specific Aims) and an initial outline of research methods. The final presentation will involve a fuller presentation of research questions and proposed methods. Feedback, didactic work, and group discussion throughout the semester will include guidance on critical components of the development of a research plan, including how to perform literature searches, formulate testable hypotheses, write critical literature summaries, and design experiments and analyses. The course will meet once a week, with faculty members from different tracks within the Pathway present at each meeting. This will allow students to receive feedback from several perspectives. Prerequisite: Member of CCSN Pathway, permission of instructor. Credit 3 units. L41 Biol 5648 Coding and Statistical Thinking in the Neurosciences Students are introduced to scientific programming in Python. Students will learn common programming constructs and how to visualize and analyze data. Coding will be integrated into a statistics curriculum introducing summary statistics, probability distributions, simulation and hypothesis testing, and power analysis for experimental design. Credit 1 unit. L41 Biol 5651 Neural Systems The course will consist of lectures and discussions of the sensory, motor and integrative systems of the brain and spinal cord, together with a weekly lab. The lectures will present aspects of most neural systems, and will be given by faculty members who have specific expertise on each topic. The discussions will include faculty led group discussions and papers presented and discussed by students. The labs will include human brain dissections, examination of histological slides, physiological recordings, behavioral methods, computational modeling, and functional neural imaging. Credit 4 units. L41 Biol 5989 Advanced Topics in Neuroscience This course will expose upper-level and postdoctoral students to advanced topics and methods in neuroscience. The course will rapidly fill gaps in student knowledge in areas that may be relevant to new directions in thesis work or interest areas. Each section of the course will be offered asynchronously, sometimes in coordination with existing journal clubs and other seminars. Each section will meet for two hours per week for three weeks. Sections may start with a didactic component or a review paper, but they will quickly delve into the discussion of primary papers curated by faculty and covering a focused topic. It is expected that papers will cover both historical and current contexts. Some sections will focus on technique; others will be conceptually focused. Each section will be led by a faculty member drawn from the Neuroscience program in an area of their expertise. Objectives include deepening critical thinking, statistical knowledge, experimental design, and technical prowess.Credit 0.5 units. Department of Neurosurgery Instruction in neurological surgery begins with an introduction to the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system presented in the first-year course in neural sciences directed by the Department of Neuroscience (http://neurosci.wustl.edu/ ), with the participation of the neurosurgery faculty. During the second year, the Department of Neurosurgery (http:// www.neurosurgery.wustl.edu ) presents the course in diseases of the nervous system in conjunction with the departments of Neurology, Pathology & Immunology, Molecular Microbiology, Medicine and Pediatrics. The course emphasizes how knowledge derived from basic or clinical investigations leads to improvements in clinical care. During the third year, students may elect to participate in a two- or four-week neurosurgery clerkship that introduces them to the clinical care of patients with diseases of the nervous system. Neurosurgical faculty members work with the neurologists to provide lectures, demonstrations and teaching exercises involving patients with neurological diagnoses as part of the clinical medicine course. Students may elect to fulfill their neurology requirement by rotating on the neurosurgery service. Students may also choose neurosurgery as part of the surgical specialty rotations. Neurosurgical diagnosis, critical care, operative treatment and ethical issues in patient management are emphasized. During the fourth year, students may choose from several advanced electives, including clinical externships in neurosurgery and experiences in basic or clinical/translational research. Neurosurgical Specialties As members of one of the most comprehensive neurosurgical programs in both the region and the nation, Washington University neurosurgeons offer exceptional care in a variety of specialties. Tumors The Department of Neurosurgery at Washington University School of Medicine offers a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach for the treatment of all types of neurological tumors, including brain tumors, inoperable tumors, pituitary tumors, skull-base tumors and spine tumors. Depending on the type of tumor, our multidisciplinary team comprises ophthalmologists, otolaryngologists, radiation and other specialists. 204Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) Aneurysms and Cerebrovascular Disorders and Diseases The multidisciplinary medical team focuses on the treatment It includes cerebrovascular surgeons, who perform microsurgical procedures, and interventional radiologists, who offer minimally invasive endovascular treatment options. We also have a team of critical care neurologists, who coordinate postprocedure care in a dedicated neurointensive care unit, as well as neurologists, who coordinate neurorehabilitation care at The Rehabilitation Institute of St. Louis. Spine Injuries and Disorders Washington University spinal neurosurgeons are recognized as national leaders in the treatment of disorders of the spine, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system. We use a multidisciplinary approach to treating spinal diseases and disorders. The personalized care of each patient is emphasized. Where appropriate, spine patients receive comprehensive, collaborative care from both neurosurgeons and specialists in thoracic surgery; vascular surgery; oncology; anesthesia; pain management; and physiatry. Peripheral Nerves Washington University neurosurgeons work with a multidisciplinary group of surgeons, neurologists and therapists to customize patient treatments to maximize functional outcomes. Washington University neurosurgeons have extensive expertise in advanced microsurgical reconstructive techniques and are on the forefront of new and innovative ways to improve patient outcomes. Pediatric Neurosurgery The entire spectrum of neurosurgical disorders in children is treated by pediatric neurosurgeons and physicians in related disciplines. Our pediatric neurosurgeons are also part of multidisciplinary teams that provide care in several specialized pediatric centers, including the brachial plexus center, the center for cerebral palsy spasticity, the neurofibromatosis clinic, the pediatric epilepsy center, the pediatric gamma knife program, the pediatric neuro-oncology program, and the spina bifida clinic. Epilepsy Our neurosurgeons are nationally recognized for their care of patients with epilepsy as well as research in this field. They are part of a multidisciplinary team that works together to develop the optimal plan to help patients control or minimize their seizures. The Department of Neurosurgery offers care forboth adults and children with medically intractable seizures; it provides a full range of surgical options for intractable epilepsy, including implantable seizure-control devices, resection of seizure foci, and vagal nerve stimulation. Movement Disorders The multidisciplinary team specializes in the treatment of movement disorders such as ataxia, catatonia, dystonia, essential tremor, Huntington's disease, myoclonus, Parkinson's disease, and Tourette's syndrome. For some patients with Parkinson's disease or essential tremor, medications are often inadequate to control disabling symptoms.

Clerkship Opportunities Students may elect to obtain their neurology clerkship experience on the neurosurgery service, or they can choose neurosurgery as part of the surgical specialty rotations. Third- year students participate with the residents and attendings on hospital rounds, evaluate patients in the neurosurgery outpatient department and participate in the neurosurgical operating room. The main objectives of the rotation include: 1) the evaluation of comatose or head-injured patients; 2) clinical presentation, diagnostic work-up and treatment of cervical and lumbar disc disease; and 3) evaluation and treatment of patients with hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. M40 NeurSurg 805 Neurosurgery Subinternship The goal of this elective is to provide an overview of neurological surgery, with most students planning to apply for neurosurgery residency in the next year. The fourth-year medical student will participate in patient work-ups, pre-, intra- and postoperative care, and diagnostic procedures. Students will also scrub in cases with senior level and chief residents assisting with neurosurgical procedures and observing the more critical portions of these procedures. It is expected that they will learn how to perform basic neurosurgical procedures such as lumbar punctures, ICP monitor placement, and ventricular drain placement. Fourth-year medical students are encouraged to participate in Grand Rounds, Neurosurgery Resident Curriculum conference, and Journal Club with the neurosurgery residents. At least one day/week is spent in an outpatient neurosurgery office setting. Students will be expected to take overnight call. A week spent on the pediatric service at St. Louis Children's Hospital is a component of this fourth-year elective. M40 NeurSurg 900 Research Elective - Neurosurgery Research opportunities may be available.

Students will work one-on-one with attending staff, to focus on an overview of evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of common obstetric and gynecologic concerns. The subintern will spend the majority of time attending half day clinics and private offices. Overnight OB call is required (approximately 2 evening shifts) to acquaint the student with the house staff and hospital, providing opportunity to participate in deliveries. If desired, additional time can be arranged to participate in/observe outpatient surgical procedures. A 30-45 minute presentation to attendings and house staff will culminate the rotation on a selected OB/GYN topic. M45 ObGyn 810 OB/GYN Reproductive Endocrinology & Infertility Subinternship The subintern will participate (in the office and hospital) in the study and treatment of women with reproductive endocrine disorders and infertility. The student will attend and present in conferences, attend surgery, observe assisted reproductive technology procedures, have assigned reading and be an integral part of the reproductive endocrine service. Opportunities for clinical research projects in reproductive endocrinology are also available. M45 ObGyn 830 Gynecologic Oncology Subinternship The subintern will take part in the work-up of tumor patients prior to surgery and/or radiotherapy, assist in pelvic operations, help render perioperative care, and review pathology specimens and slides.

Opportunities for clinical or basic research projects in gynecologic malignancy are also available. M45 ObGyn 833 Special Topics in Reproductive Health Students will attend a variety of outpatient clinics to interact with patients seeking different reproductive health services. These topics include family planning and abortion services at the Hope Clinic and BJH; general gynecology services at our faculty practice GYN clinic (WHC) and OB/GYN resident clinic (COH 3); specialized reproductive health services including STI testing and contraception at the St. Louis STD clinic, the SPOT, and C3 Clinic; and OB and pregnancy centering clinics at the Center for Outpatient Health and Affinia. There may also be an opportunity to attend an adolescent and pediatric gynecology clinic, a women's cardiology clinic, and an adult transgender care clinic. Clinical experiences will be mainly ambulatory, but there 219Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) is potential to work with the Family Planning faculty physicians in the operating room at Barnes Jewish Hospital. The student will prepare a 15-20 minute presentation on a reproductive health topic of their choice to present at the end of the rotation. M45 ObGyn 843 Maternal-Fetal Medicine Outpatient Care Subinternship Students will see a variety of high-risk obstetrical patients in the outpatient setting in the Center for Outpatient Health. The student will evaluate various types of reproductive-age patients with medical or obstetrical complications, including preconception consultations, prenatal care consultations, and initial prenatal visits. The student will also see return patients to experience the continuity of prenatal care. Students will participate in antenatal testing and learn basic ultrasonography skills. The student will be responsible for one presentation to be given to the OB teams at the end of the rotation. Students are provided independent study time to put together the presentation, which should be created in PowerPoint and on a topic of their choice, inspired by a patient-related clinical condition that piqued their interest during the block. In addition, the student will have the option to take overnight call or call in the Pregnancy Assessment Center in order to gain more hands- on experience with inpatient obstetrics; this is voluntary and not a requirement. M45 ObGyn 844 Maternal-Fetal Medicine Inpatient (Antepartum) Subinternship Areas of patient care will include the Women's Assessment Center (WAC), the Antepartum Unit, and Labor & Delivery. The primary team will be the Antepartum Team, which includes a second-year and third-year OB/GYN resident, an MFM fellow, and the MFM attending. Students are expected to become functioning members of the antepartum team, with their own patients whom they will be responsible for rounding on and completing day-to-day tasks. Our patients include those who are admitted to the Antepartum Unit, various intensive care units, and other services with complications in pregnancy. The student will prepare a brief talk on a topic of their interest during the course of the rotation. M45 ObGyn 856 OB/GYN Ultrasound: Genetics Working with the attending physicians in the Ultrasound Units at the Center for Outpatient Health and the Center for Women's Wellness at Missouri Baptist Medical Center, the student will learn the principles and techniques of non-invasive screening for fetal disorders and observe the performance of invasive prenatal diagnostic procedures. The student will also learn the standards and guidelines for performance of the antepartum obstetrical ultrasound examination and female pelvic examination. Normal and abnormal fetal and gynecologic anatomy will be reviewed. Experience will be gained in pedigree analysis and familial risk factor assessment by working with genetic counselors. One day is spent in the Cytogenetics Laboratory observing the preparation of prenatal specimens for karyotype analysis. Opportunities for participation in clinical research are also available. M45 ObGyn 870 Pediatric & Adolescent Gynecology Subinternship Students will be working with two attendings, a fellow, and residents in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. They will largely be following this team from the outpatient offices located at COH 7, South County, Missouri Baptist & St. LouisChildren's Hospital. In addition, OR experiences are located at both Parkview Tower 3 and Children's. The range of topics likely encountered will include gynecologic care in children and young adults, including menstrual and pubertal concerns; sexual health and contraception; vulvar vaginal irritation and labial adhesions; adolescent breast disorders; ovarian pathology and torsion; genital trauma; adolescent PCOS; pelvic pain and endometriosis; and the diagnosis and management of congenital gynecologic abnormalities and fertility preservation. Students will be involved in general pediatric and adolescent gynecology clinics as well specialty clinics (Disorders of Sexual Difference and Fertility Preservation/Gynecologic Late-Effects), and they will assist with inpatient and emergency room consultations and scheduled and emergent surgical cases as available. Subinterns will be required to give a presentation on a PAG topic of their choice by the end of the rotation, and they will have the option to participate in PAG research. M45 ObGyn 875 Affinia Ambulatory OB/GYN with a small subset of Affinia OB/GYN physicians at their office locations spread throughout St. Louis city.

Beyond general OB/GYN practice, this rotation will lend more perspective on access to care challenges and various aspects of health inequities. M45 ObGyn 880 Family Planning Ambulatory Subinternship Subinterns will work in small groups typically comprised of the attending, fellow, and resident within the office setting. The array of encounters will vary between ambulatory gynecology and family planning consultations. Topics specific to family planning include more complicated contraceptive counseling and treatment options in addition to providing treatment options for first- and second-trimester abortions, whether elective, due to lethal anomalies, or for maternal health concerns. Exposures to office-based procedures will include manual vacuum aspiration usage, laminaria placement, familiarity with medication usage (e.g., mifepristone), and other general gynecologic procedures (e.g., colposcopies, biopsy samplings, contraceptive placements). M45 ObGyn 900 Research Elective - Obstetrics and Gynecology Research opportunities may be available. If interested, please contact the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. John F.

Hardesty, MD, Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences has a strong legacy and is a national leader in clinical ophthalmology and research. It is ranked among the top ten best overall programs in the United States, and it is also considered one of the top ten best research programs by U.S. News & World Report. Our ophthalmology department is fourth in National Institutes of Health funding for research and has one of the nation's largest ophthalmology research faculty. The department's mission is as follows: \"As world 220Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) leaders in patient care, teaching and research, we strive to touch lives and preserve and restore vision through innovation and compassionate service.\" We hope that students will join us to enrich their medical education and to experience the collaborative culture of ophthalmology. Although only a small percentage of physicians in the United States specialize in ophthalmology, there is no doubt that all physicians need a basic understanding of the eye and what it can reveal about a patient's condition. In a recent article published in the journal Ophthalmology, it was stated that \"ophthalmology-related issues arise in the diagnosis and treatment of inpatients and outpatients on internal medicine, pediatrics, trauma neurosurgery, otolaryngology, dermatology, oncology, and went on to state that \"[m]ost primary care program directors believe fewer than 50% of incoming residents have sufficient ophthalmology skills when entering the internship period of medical education. Ophthalmoscopy is one of many ophthalmic skills in which there seems to be a gap in the training of medical students. [A study] demonstrated that emergency medicine physicians often do not perform an ophthalmoscopic examination when it is indicated, and when they do, they are unlikely to detect abnormal findings. This presents a serious issue, because patients with visual impairments are more likely to be hospitalized, and from 2006 through 2011, there were 12 million eye-related emergency department visits nationwide. If they are unable to view or interpret fundus findings with either an ophthalmoscope or fundus photography, the students must know when it is necessary to refer their patients to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation.\" In other words, even if a physician does not plan to make ophthalmology their career, deepening their knowledge of this field will enhance their skills as a physician in any field. At Washington University School of Medicine, medical students under the Legacy Curriculum begin ophthalmology-based instruction during the first year with examination of the eye and a lecture on various aspects of ocular disease. During the second year, students receive a refresher lecture and lab on direct ophthalmoscopy as well as a lecture on ophthalmic manifestations of systemic disease and primary ocular disease. During the third year, students are given the opportunity during the surgery clerkship to spend four weeks on the ophthalmology services; in addition, there are lectures given to students during the Internal Medicine rotations. During the fourth year, a four- week intensive clinical rotation is tailored to students interested in pursuing ophthalmology as a career. Research electives are available under the guidance of numerous ophthalmology faculty members for fourth-year students. Newer medical students under the Gateway Curriculum have the option of choosing ophthalmology for a three-week-long clinical experience during their first-year Procedural Immersion. More intensive clinical rotations will be available in later phases of the new curriculum.1Graubart EB, Waxman EL, Forster SH, Giaconi JA, Rosenberg JB, Sankar PS, Goyal A, Mirza RG.

Below is a list of faculty that have ongoing research projects that involve medical students. If a student is interested in working with a faculty member that is not listed below, they can contact the faculty directly to see if there are any research opportunities in their lab. All residents are encouraged to pursue projects in laboratory or clinical investigation. Research familiarizes the resident with the limitations of laboratory methodology, provides a background for evaluating the literature, helps to develop critical thinking, and allows for a better informed choice for career goals. The type of project is the choice of the resident, and a wide range of opportunities are available. An annual Rosenbaum Research Award of $1,000 is presented to the resident who performs the most exciting research. The department emphasizes basic science research as well as clinical research. Basic science research currently involves five principal areas: Neurobiology, Immunology, Molecular Biology, Pharmacology/Physiology, and Clinical Studies and Outcomes Research. There are many opportunities for research in clinical areas as well. Further descriptions of our research labs can be found on the Research Opportunities page (https://ophthalmology.wustl.edu/ research-opportunities/ ) of the Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences website.

Visit online course listings to view offerings for M50 Ophth (https://courses.wustl.edu/CourseInfo.aspx?sch=M&dept=M50). Gateway Curriculum Under the new Gateway Curriculum, medical students spend their four years split among three phases. Phase 1 involves the first 16 months of medical school. During Phase 1, students participate in three Procedural Immersions, which are three- week-long clinical and surgical experiences. The primary goals of the Procedural Immersions are to socialize the student to different clinical settings, to hone their clinical skills, and to allow them to explore the impact of society and health systems on an individual patient's health. This 360-degree approach to early clinical exposure allows students to view practicing medicine through physician, patient, and systems lenses. In these rotations, medical students will often focus on longitudinal patient care by following a specific patient from the time they arrive until they leave and seeing how all health care team members are involved in that patient's visit. During the Ophthalmology Procedural Immersion, students spend time in the University Eye Clinic and in the pediatric and adult subspecialty clinics and operating rooms, and they attend rounds with an inpatient consult team. This early exposure to clinical experience helps students to contextualize the classroom and clinical learning that they continue with over the next two phases. The basic and clinical science of ophthalmology is taught in Phase 1 during Module 7: Brain and Behavior. During this module, the students will spend time learning about eye anatomy and physiology, the visual pathways in the brain, and the mechanisms of extraocular movements. The students participate in interactive case sessions that reinforce the material and encourage students to practice their critical thinking and eye examination skills. 231Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) During Phase 3, medical students will have opportunities to participate in electives in ophthalmology and advanced clinical rotations in ophthalmology. These will allow students to obtain further experience in clinical ophthalmology to strengthen their clinical knowledge and examination skills. The students will work closely with the ophthalmology residents and review the differential diagnosis of the \"red eye,\" the interpretation of an ophthalmologic consult note, and the handling of ocular emergencies. During this rotation, there is again emphasis on the use of the ophthalmoscope. Additional clinical skills introduced to rotating students include the use of the slit lamp and indirect ophthalmoscopy. Legacy Curriculum: Fourth Year The Ophthalmology Sub-Internship Rotation occurs during this time. During the month of June during their fourth year, students interested in pursuing a career in ophthalmology are encouraged to complete this intensive four-week rotation. Students will have personal indirect ophthalmoscopy lenses available for use on the rotation. Formal didactic sessions and workshops will be used to teach students how to perform a detailed ophthalmic history and exam, including the mastery of advanced slit lamp techniques and indirect fundoscopy. Students present a case at the department's grand rounds. By the end of the rotation, students will be expected to function at the level of a first-year ophthalmology resident. Curriculum Courses M50 Ophth 801 Ophthalmology Subinternship This elective is for senior students who plan to apply for a residency in Ophthalmology. In accordance with any subinternship, medical students will be expected to function at the level of a beginning first-year ophthalmology resident on this rotation. The students will rotate through the resident eye clinic and the subspecialty clinics of the full time faculty of the Washington University Medical School Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences (e.g., neuro-ophthalmology service, cornea/external disease service, etc.). Students may opt to check out indirect ophthalmoscopy lenses that may be used for the month to facilitate the acquisition of fundoscopy skills. During the rotation, the student's responsibilities range from observation to working at a resident level and completing full eye examinations. There will be a rigorous academic curriculum for the rotation, including a weekly case presentation, weekly attendance at grand rounds, and a mix of medical student- oriented and resident-oriented conferences. On day one, students will receive a rotating call schedule for the entire month. A medical student is expected to be present at all times to assist the primary call ophthalmology resident during the rotation. By the end of the four-week rotation, the student is expected to be proficient in taking an ocular history and performing a complete eye exam including slit lamp biomicroscopy and indirect ophthalmoscopy. All students interested in this senior elective must contact Course Director in March of year WUMS- III. The final grade of the student is determined by input from the director of the particular service(s) through which the student rotated, plus the case presentations.M50 Ophth 805 Ophthalmology The Ophthalmology elective is designed to provide a foundational experience in clinical and surgical ophthalmology for medical students. Time will be divided between the University Eye Service clinic, adult inpatient consults, pediatric ophthalmology, and other ophthalmology subspecialties ophthalmology (e.g. Glaucoma, Cornea, or Retina). The amount of time at each location will depend on length of the rotation and the student's specific interests. There are didactic sessions with Dr. Andrew Lee and Dr. Cynthia Montana during which the students present their own cases. In addition, there are continuing opportunities to attend educational conferences. At the end of the experience, the student is expected to be familiar with the routine eye exam, common eye conditions and their treatment, and the use of the slit lamp and ophthalmoscope. M50 Ophth 816 Away Rotation in Ophthalmology This four-week elective is for senior students from medical schools across the United States who are in good standing at their home institution and who are planning to apply for a residency in ophthalmology. To enroll in this elective, students must first apply online for the elective via the visiting student application service (VSAS). These applications will be reviewed and invitations will then be sent to individuals to enroll in the elective. Due to large demand, not all eligible away students will be accepted for the rotation. The dates for this elective are not flexible. The students will rotate through the resident eye clinic and the subspecialty clinics of the full time faculty of the Washington University Medical School Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences (e.g., neuro-ophthalmology service, cornea/external disease service, etc.). In exchange for a refundable deposit, students may opt to check-out indirect ophthalmoscopy lenses that may be used for the month to facilitate the acquisition of fundoscopy skills. During the rotation, the student's responsibilities range from observation (including observing surgery) to working at a resident level and completing full eye examinations. Didactics will include weekly case presentation sessions, weekly attendance at grand rounds, and a mix of medical student-oriented and resident-oriented conferences. Also, there will be medical student-oriented workshops to learn the basics of the slit lamp and indirect ophthalmoscopy. On day one, students will receive a schedule of conferences that they are expected to attend during the month. By the end of the four-week rotation, the student is expected to be proficient in taking an ocular history and performing a complete eye exam including slit lamp biomicroscopy and indirect ophthalmoscopy. M50 Ophth 900 Research Elective - Ophthalmology Research opportunities may be available. If interested, please contact the Department of Ophthalmology. 232Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) Department of Orthopaedic Surgery Orthopaedic surgery is concerned with the injuries, diseases and conditions of the musculoskeletal system.

Department of Otolaryngology The Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery (http:// oto.wustl.edu/ ) at Washington University in St. Louis has a rich, 130-year history of leadership in our field that is built on the foundations of academic medicine: patient care, research, training and service. Our past leaders include luminaries in the field of otolaryngology, such as John Blasdel Shapleigh, MD; Greenfield Sluder, John Fredrickson, MD; A. PhD; and, presently, Craig A. Buchman, MD, FACS. Even from our earliest days \u2014 prior to the inception of the McMillan Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat Hospital (circa 1943) \u2014 excellence has been an integral part of the department's fabric. A look at former faculty and program graduates reveals many of the true innovators in our field. While we remain humbled by our beginnings and past achievements, we choose not to rest on our laurels. Rather, we aspire to further our commitment to improving patients' lives by leading our field and its clinical application. Today, more than ever, we are driven to provide highest-quality, cutting-edge patient care that is both safe and effective. Our Washington University physicians and team, together with our Honor Roll Award-winning hospital, Barnes-Jewish Hospital (U.S. News , 2020-21), are second to none when it comes to tackling the full spectrum of conditions involving the ear, nose, throat, head and neck. Our basic, translational and clinical research programs are remarkable, providing answers to a variety of relevant questions that build on our foundations of knowledge, lay the groundwork for future clinical trials, and provide state-of-the-art patient solutions. Our educational programs for medical and graduate students, physicians in training, and established practitioners are committed to creating a culture of lifelong learning that firmly establishes our next generation of leaders in the field. Our residency program is highly rated by all metrics, providing balanced training across the clinical subspecialties and unique opportunities for growth and development as clinician-scientists (T32 training grant) and educators. We are most proud that these activities are ongoing in a work culture that values collegiality, inclusiveness, diversity and mutual respect. The Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at Washington University in St. Louis is a truly outstanding place! 241Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) CID at Washington University School of Medicine The consortium of graduate education, research and clinical programs known today as CID at Washington University School of Medicine was born out of the pioneering efforts of St. Louis physician Max Goldstein, MD. In 1914, he founded the Central Institute for the Deaf (CID), where doctors and teachers worked together to help deaf people. When CID's school building opened two years later, its auditory/oral methods for instructing deaf children were groundbreaking. Washington University and CID first joined forces in 1931, when CID's established teacher training program became the first deaf education undergraduate program to affiliate with a university. Graduate programs in deaf education, audiology, and speech and hearing sciences soon followed. Beginning in the 1930s, CID's research efforts involved the study of the anatomy and science of hearing. During World War II, CID's research on hearing loss in military personnel laid the foundation for the field of audiology. CID also pioneered hearing testing and hearing aids, and it opened the country's first hearing aid clinic in 1941. In September 2003, a new affiliation transferred CID's graduate degree programs, research programs and adult audiology clinic \u2014 along with its building \u2014 to Washington University School of Medicine. The CID school continues to operate on the School of Medicine campus as CID \u2014 Central Institute for the Deaf. Today, these programs continue to work together to fulfill a shared mission to serve people with hearing loss. Website: http://oto.wustl.edu Faculty Craig A.

The type of research will depend upon the current phase of the research program in each laboratory. Students should contact the director of each laboratory to negotiate. Tatyana Yakusheva, PhD East McDonnell Science Building 4566 Scott Avenue Phone: 314-362-1013 This lab studies the role of the vestibulocerebellum and its target nuclei for eye movement control and spatial orientation. We use a range of methodologies, including single and multiunit recordings, electrical brain stimulation, computational methods, pharmacology and behavioral studies. Our main lines of research are as follows: (1) signal transformations carried out by the the vestibulocerebellum during visual and vestibular stimulation; (2) neuronal computations performed by the anterior and posterior cerebellar vermis for spatial navigation in mice; and (3) the role of the cerebellum-brainstem loop in motor learning in the vestibulo-ocular reflex. Students will be instructed in one or several techniques and are expected to contribute significantly to the development of specific lab projects. Judith E.C. Lieu, MD, MSPH 3S35 Children's Hospital and McMillan, 9th Floor Phone: 314-747-8205 The focus of the Lieu Lab is clinical outcomes research in pediatric otolaryngology. The techniques and methodologies of clinical epidemiology and health services research are applied to investigate clinical problems in children. Projects currently underway include the evaluation of the quality of life of young 246Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) children with hearing loss, the evaluation of hearing loss on the perception of fatigue in children, and the evaluation of fatigue experienced in children with hearing loss compared with those who have sleep apnea. Potential studies include evaluating changes in the quality of life of children who begin using hearing amplification devices. Other projects of the student's choosing that would utilize these research techniques may also be pursued. Kevin K. Ohlemiller, PhD 2205 Central Institute for the Deaf Phone: 314-747-7179 The focus of this lab is on gene-environment interactions in cochlear injury. We study the interaction of genes and environment that increase cochlear injury due to noise and ototoxic exposure, with an emphasis on how these may yield apparent presbycusis. Because cochlear function and injury is the same in mice and humans and governed by the same genes, we use mostly mouse models. Methods employed include standard auditory brainstem response assessment and intracochlear recording, quantitative light microscopy, immunocytochemistry, and Western blots. We and our collaborators have identified specific genes and inbred strains of mice that mimic the three major forms of human presbycusis (sensory, neural and strial). Sensory presbycusis appears to be promoted by alleles and mutations that impair protective factors (e.g., antioxidant enzymes) or that impair ion homeostasis. These may enhance cochlear injury from noise and ototoxins. Neural presbycusis can be modeled in part by mutations that impair inner hair cell/afferent synaptic function. Although it is not yet clear what types of genes and mutations can lead to strial presbycusis, we have discovered multiple mouse strains that show age-related endocochlear potential reduction along with distinctive strial pathology that includes fewer marginal cells as well as fewer and larger strial capillaries. We have also published quantitative trait loci that impact the qualitative character of cochlear noise injury. Important implications of our findings are (1) that there exists no single \"mammalian\" archetype of cochlear noise injury and (2) that noise injury to the organ of Corti in young adult animals depends in part on the status of the cochlear lateral wall. The latter relation appears to be genetically linked and appears not to apply to older adults. We collaborate widely, both within the School of Medicine and nationally. Our research is eminently adaptable in difficulty and scale to students' schedules and other requirements. Students may expect to learn the full range of methods we employ, including physiology, immunocytochemistry, histopathology and cellular/molecular techniques.Jay F. Piccirillo, MD McMillan, 9th Floor Phone: 314-362-8641 The Clinical Outcomes Research Office performs clinical epidemiology and health services research. Clinical epidemiology is the study of diagnosis, prognosis and the evaluation of treatment. Health service research is the study of the delivery of health care. The scientific methodology of clinical epidemiology is based on the architecture of clinical research, biostatistics and data processing. Current projects include studying the impact of comorbidities on the treatment and outcomes of patients with cancer. We also conduct research into the neurobiology, treatment and outcomes of patients with tinnitus. One method that we employ is the use of smartphone technology to capture ecological momentary assessments of tinnitus. Additional projects include exploiting neuroplasticity as part of olfactory training for patients with anosmia. With the use of clinical epidemiology methodology, we can also study a variety of other diseases. Courses Visit online course listings to view offerings for M55 Oto (https:// courses.wustl.edu/CourseInfo.aspx?sch=M&dept=M55 ). M55 Oto 660B Clinical Topics In Otolaryngology This course consists of nine introductory lectures on common diseases of the head and neck, including voice disorders, head and neck cancer, hearing loss, management of vertigo, pediatric otolaryngology, salivary gland disorders, sinusitis, otolaryngologic emergencies and facial trauma. Additionally, there is a case-based roundtable focusing on otolaryngology disorders affecting the geriatric population and the involvement of allied health care disciplines in the evaluation and management of these patients. Each lecture is highlighted by case presentations and treatment options in addition to pathophysiology. This course follows the physical examination practicum given earlier in the academic year. Credit 9 units. M55 Oto 801 Otolaryngology Subinternship Four-week rotation includes evaluation of ENT problems presented to specialist for diagnosis and treatment. The student participates in the clinic, hospital, and operating room. This may also include time on the Pediatric ENT Service, Audiology, Voice Laboratory, and Vestibular Evaluation Laboratory. Option of rotation on the ENT Service at VAMC is possible. M55 Oto 803 Pediatric Otolaryngology The student will actively participate in the clinical office, inpatient consultations, and surgery with the attending staff at St. Louis Children's Hospital. Care would be taken to provide experience in the common problems one would see in primary care pediatrics or family practice. Participation in sub-specialty/ multidisciplinary clinics such as the Cleft and Craniofacial 247Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) clinic is encouraged. Opportunity will be provided to learn the fundamentals of audiological evaluation. Students participating in this elective will attend academic conferences in both the pediatric and adult divisions.

Allen, PhD BJC Institute of Health, 8th Floor Phone: 314-362-8758 This lab's focus is on research in immunology and the recognition of antigen by T cells. We are investigating how the T cell receptor functions developmentally, biochemically and structurally. We utilize in vivo models to study the role of T cells in alloreactivity/graft rejection and inflammatory bowel disease. Jacques U.

Michael McDaniel, PhD 3709 West Building Phone: 314-362-7435 The focus of this laboratory is to study the function and growth of pancreatic islets in Types 1 and 2 diabetes. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a protein kinase that integrates signals from growth factors and nutrients to regulate DNA and protein synthesis. G-protein-coupled receptor agonists such as GLP-1 have been shown to enhance proinsulin biosynthesis and secretion and to stimulate cellular growth and proliferation. Our objective is to further explore the mechanisms of action of GLP-1 to enhance DNA and protein synthesis via mTOR in rodent and human islets. These studies are of fundamental interest for optimizing mTOR to induce cellular growth and proliferation, to enhance pre- and post-islet transplantation in Type 1 diabetes, and to prolong b-cell compensation in response to insulin resistance in Type 2 diabetes. The failure of b-cells in obesity-associated Type 2 diabetes is believed to correlate with the intracellular accumulation of lipids that contribute to defects in insulin secretion and the maintenance of b-cell mass. Our studies have identified lipoprotein lipase in b-cells; this is a key enzyme for catalyzing the hydrolysis of lipoprotein-associated TAG to produce free fatty acids (FFAs) for local cellular uptake. We are also characterizing the effects of enhanced FFA uptake through fatty acid transporters and determining the regulation of lipid droplet synthesis and breakdown by lipid droplet-associated proteins. Recent studies suggest that FFAs upregulate mitochondrial uncoupling proteins proposed to 256Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) dissipate the proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane. The objective of this study is to delineate the link between FFAs and b-cell mitochondrial dysfunction in Type 2 diabetes. Kenneth M.

Steven Teitelbaum, MD Barnes-Jewish Hospital Phone: 314-454-8463 This lab studies the cellular and molecular mechanisms of bone remodeling, with particular emphasis on osteoclast biology as it relates to the pathogenesis and prevention of diseases such as osteoporosis. We focus on integrin and cytokine biology utilizing a variety of genetically manipulated mice. John Turk, MD, PhD 6609 Wohl Phone: 314-362-8190 This lab looks at phospholipase A2 in the regulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic islet cells (e.g., a novel iPLA2 that does not require Ca2+ cloned from rat and human islets that is involved in cell secretion and proliferation).We also perform studies of iPLA2, its post-translational modifications, and its interactions with other proteins involving mice that are iPLA2-deficient globally or in selected tissues, transgenic mice that overexpress iPL2 in -cells, and insulinoma cells with genetically manipulated iPLA2 expression. The mass spectrometric characterization of proteins and complex lipids is an important tool in these studies. Emil R. Unanue, MD BJC Institute of Health, 8414 Phone: 314-362-8748 Our focus is research that involves immunobiology and immunopathology. We examine cellular interactions that result in immune induction and cellular immunity. These cellular interactions are examined in normal immune responses and in autoimmune diseases. The focus is to identify the proteins responsible for the activation of lymphocytes in Type 1 diabetes. Herbert Virgin, MD, PhD Clinical Sciences Research Building, Room 8849 Phone: 314-362-9223 We work on issues at the interface of virology and immunology by analyzing aspects of viral immunity, viral pathogenesis and viral genetics that contribute to virulence and disease. Mark A. Watson, MD, PhD Clinical Sciences Research Building, North Tower, Room 1029 Phone: 314-454-7919 Our laboratory is interested in defining patterns of somatic gene mutation, gene expression and quantitative tumor clonality that can be used to predict distant site metastases and therapeutic vulnerability in patients with lung and breast cancer. Experimental approaches use histopathological review as well as the next-generation DNA exome and RNA sequencing (NGS) of primary cancer patient tissues, coupled with bioinformatics and statistical modeling, to identify candidate biomarker patterns that may be useful for the clinical management of cancer patients.

Students will work with residents/fellows on the rotation and participate as part of the team. M60 Path 815 OB/GYN Pathology This elective is a subinternship in Ob/Gyn pathology. The expectation is that the student participate in the service along with house officer rotating on the service. The elective stresses the principles of anatomic pathology when applied to operative material in obstetrics and gynecology. The sub- intern will examine gross and microscopic specimens in the Ob/Gyn Pathology Lab and review the histology along with pertinent literature with a senior pathologist. The elective is appropriate both for students intending a career in pathology, and those intending careers in other specialties. The student will gain familiarity with the diagnosis of more common OB/Gyn diagnoses, including malignancy, and premalignant conditions, as well as placental conditions. Ample time will be available for attending conferences in both OB/Gyn and Pathology. M60 Path 820 Surgical Pathology This elective is designed to familiarize students with the discipline of Surgical Pathology and to encourage the development of basic skills in gross pathology and histopathological interpretation. The Laboratory of Surgical Pathology at Barnes-Jewish Hospital receives a broad range of medical biopsy material in addition to specimens derived from the busy surgical subspecialty practices. As a result, this elective is beneficial not only for students considering a career in pathology, but also for students planning careers in internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics-gynecology, pediatrics, radiology, radiation oncology and dermatology. Students on this elective will (1) learn how patient specimens are received and processed, (2) acquire skills in the gross examination and microscopic diagnosis of disease through active participation, and (3) learn the role of the pathologist in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care and management of patients. Students will function as junior house staff, managing their own cases with supervision from residents, fellows, and attending pathologists. Students may also wish to participate in ongoing research projects within the department as time and interest allow. At the end of the rotation, students are required to do a formal case presentation for the residents, fellows, and attending staff. The daily schedule for students begins at 8:00 am with morning conference. In general, the student will be able to complete all gross examination and sign-out activities by 4:30 pm. Students are welcome to stay beyond 4:30 pm to participate in any of the academic or other working activities of the Division.

The course is structured to give the student a full-time immersion in the specialty of neuropathology, including both neurosurgical and neuroautopsy derived material. There are daily didactic sessions that cover the spectrum of neurological diseases, review gross and microscopic neuro-anatomy, discuss approaches to the diagnosis of nervous system disease, and point out the interrelationships of research to clinical problems. Multiple clinical conferences and diagnostic working sessions complement reading, use of a large microscopic divisional study set and project work.M60 Path 860 Clinical Laboratory Medicine This elective rotation is designed to teach the student how clinical laboratory assays are used in the diagnosis of disease and to understand the quality assurance tools the laboratory utilizes to assure the reliability of tests. The elective includes rotations through a variety of clinical laboratories including clinical chemistry, clinical microbiology, hematopathology, molecular pathology, and transfusion medicine. During the elective the student will have a daily schedule, which includes didactic sessions with faculty and regular interactions with house staff. Some examples of useful clinical skills acquired during the experience include: morphologic review of peripheral blood smears and bone marrow biopsies; interpretation of coagulation tests, biomarkers of cardiac damage and serum protein electrophoresis patterns; identification of infectious organisms; and appropriate use of blood component therapy and therapeutic apheresis. The rotation culminates with a case discussion presented by the medical student which focuses on application of clinical laboratory evaluations to direct patient care.

Vikas Dharnidharka, MD, MPH Northwest Tower, 10th Floor Phone: 314-286-1574 The focus of this lab is on clinical and translational research in childhood kidney disease. Our group is involved in several different types of clinical and translational research, including multicenter clinical intervention trials to improve teen adherence with transplant medications and to test new medications in children on dialysis; translational biomarker studies in transplant acute and chronic rejection and genomic studies or post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease; and large transplant database epidemiological analyses for associations of immunosuppressive regimens with efficacy and morbidity balance. Stephanie A. Fritz, MD, MSCI Northwest Tower, Room 10125 Phone: 314-454-4115Our research team studies the epidemiology, microbial virulence mechanisms, and host defenses against community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) colonization, transmission and disease. We are investigating the transmission dynamics of CA-MRSA in households as well as interventions to interrupt the transmission of CA-MRSA and to prevent subsequent infections. Our lab also explores the microbial and host genomic determinants as well as the host immune response to staphylococcal toxins implicated in the pathogenesis of CA-MRSA in patients across the spectrum of disease states. Our goal is to develop novel approaches for the prevention of CA-MRSA infections. Carmen Halabi, MD, PhD McDonnell Pediatric Research Building, 4th Floor, Room 4107 Phone: 314-286-1376 Our focus is on the extracellular matrix in vascular development and disease. Specifically, we study the extracellular matrix proteins that make up the elastic fibers of blood vessels. Elastic fibers convey elasticity to blood vessels, allowing large arteries to store energy during systole and release it during diastole. Abnormalities in elastic fiber components lead to various complications, including hypertension, stiff vessels, and aneurysms. In the laboratory, we utilize mouse models to understand how abnormalities in these proteins lead to disease, which helps us not only to learn about the normal function of these proteins but also to identify potential novel therapeutic targets. Robert J. Hayashi, MD St. Louis Children's Hospital, Suite 9S Phone: 314-454-4118 Our clinical research interests include stem cell transplantation and its complications, including post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease and the long-term side effects of therapy. Keith A. Hruska, MD McDonnell Pediatric Research Building, 5th Floor Phone: 314-286-2772 The research in the laboratory focuses on chronic kidney disease and its complications of the chronic kidney disease mineral bone disorder syndrome, which involves skeletal frailty, cardiovascular disease, and vascular calcification. The lab has discovered important new pathologic mechanisms of disease leading to vascular calcification through systemic effects of factors involved in renal repair and hyperphosphatemia. Translational studies that continue to develop new therapeutic approaches are being aggressively pursued.

David A. Hunstad, MD McDonnell Pediatric Research Building, Room 6106 Phone: 314-286-2710 Work in our lab focuses on the interactions of pathogenic bacteria with their hosts. We aim to elucidate the modulation of host immune responses by pathogens and to determine the mechanisms by which these bacteria present specific virulence factors on their surfaces. Currently, we use cultured bladder epithelial cell models and murine models of cystitis to investigate the ability of uropathogenic Escherichia coli to modulate host innate and adaptive immune responses. In addition, we are studying the molecular mechanisms by which selected outer membrane proteins contribute to the virulence of uropathogenic E. coli. Our primary goal is to discover novel targets for interventions that will prevent and better treat bacterial infections of the urinary tract. Along these lines, we are leveraging recent discoveries in UTI pathogenesis to design nanoparticle-based therapies for the prevention of acute and recurrent UTI. We have also launched a new translational study of immune responses to UTI in male and female infants, paired with an innovative new mouse model of male UTI that permits first-ever studies of sex differences in these infections. S. Celeste Morley, MD, PhD McDonnell Pediatric Research Building, Room 6105 Phone: 314-286-2136 Our laboratory investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying immune cell signaling and trafficking using mouse models. We hope to identify the molecules that are critical for host defense against infectious organisms such as pneumococcus. Our focus is currently on an actin-binding protein called L-plastin, which is required for normal T and B cell motility. Alan L. Schwartz, PhD, MD 425 McDonnell Sciences Building Phone: 314-286-1709 Our investigative efforts are aimed at understanding the biology of cell surface receptors, including the biochemical and molecular dissection of the mechanisms responsible for the receptor-mediated endocytosis of blood coagulation proteins and the regulation of intracellular protein turnover.Shalini Shenoy, MD St. Louis Children's Hospital, Suite 9S Phone: 314-454-6018 Investigation of novel reduced-intensity transplant strategies for pediatric nonmalignant disorders and the immunologic basis of graft-versus-host disease and graft rejection Gregory A.

Note to Students: There are always a number of research projects in the Department of Psychiatry. For additional information, contact Dr. Rubin at 314-362-2462. Andrey Anokhin, PhD Genetics of the Brain, Behavior and Psychopathology Central Institute for the Deaf (CID) Building 660 S. Euclid Ave., Suite 1 Phone: 314-286-2201 andrey@wustl.edu This research elective is intended for students interested in cognitive neuroscience, biological psychiatry, and behavior genetics. Dr. Anokhin's laboratory investigates the links between genes, brain and behavior in order to better understand the complex etiology of mental disorders. Our major focus is on the externalizing spectrum of psychopathology characterized by deficits in inhibitory self-regulation and related psychopathologies, including ADHD, conduct disorder and addictive behaviors. We are particularly interested in the intermediate phenotypes (endophenotypes) mediating genetic risk for addiction, such as impulsivity, risk taking, and abnormal reward processing. In our laboratory-based studies with human volunteers, including twins, we investigate individual differences in brain activity using the recording of brain oscillations (event- related brain potentials) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). For example, an ongoing longitudinal study of adolescent twins explores the developmental and genetic determinants of brain activity related to reward and punishment processing, inhibitory control of behavior, and risk taking to identify prospective predictors of substance abuse and associated behavioral problems. In another ongoing study, we examine twins who are discordant for adolescent marijuana use in order to identify the consequences of substance abuse for the brain, cognition and emotion and to distinguish them from preexisting risk factors. Interested students will be able to learn a variety of methods used in these studies, such as the recordingand analysis of neural activity, including electroencephalogram (EEG) and event-related brain potentials (ERPs), MRI scanning, startle response, autonomic measures, the administration of neuropsychological and behavioral tests, and the statistical analysis of data. The format of this research elective may include the following: (1) directed reading; (2) participation in laboratory experiments involving human subjects; (3) analysis of existing data from various research projects; and (4) designing and piloting new behavioral experiments. Qualifications include reliability and responsibility, the ability to commit a specified amount of time per week and to work a schedule that can be negotiated on an individual basis, and good computer skills. Deanna M. Barch, PhD Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience of Schizophrenia and Depression 4525 Scott Avenue, Suite 1153K Phone: 314-747-2160 Students may participate in the conduct of clinical studies of schizophrenia and depression. Involvement in clinical studies can include training and experience in interviewing psychiatric patients, or it may involve gaining experience in the techniques of assessing cognitive and emotional function using behavioral and brain imaging methods. Laura Jean Bierut, MD Renard Building Phone: 314-362-2544 This research elective will focus on analyzing data from high-risk studies of smoking and other addictions. Students will have the opportunity to examine genetic and environmental factors that place some individuals at risk for developing nicotine, alcohol and other substance dependence and that protect others from the development of these disorders. Kevin J. Black, MD 4525 Scott Ave., Room 2205 Phone: 314-362-5041 kevin@wustl.edu Students will participate in ongoing studies of brain imaging, movement disorders or neuropsychiatric illnesses. Degree of participation will relate to the student's available research time, skills and interest. Visit the laboratory's webpage (https:// sites.wustl.edu/blacklab/ ) for examples of past research. Ginger E. Nicol, MD Taylor Avenue Building, Suite 121 Phone: 314-362-5154 305Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) We are part of the Healthy Mind Lab in the department of psychiatry, and our clinical research broadly focuses on increasing longevity and quality of life in children, adolescents, adults and older adults. Our specific projects focus primarily on obesity treatment and prevention, and they include clinical and genetic studies of psychotropic medications known to cause weight gain, like antipsychotic agents. We are interested in developing and testing medication-assisted psychotherapies with agents like ketamine and psilocybin for weight management and disordered eating. We also employ mobile health (mHealth) tools for collecting data and for delivering healthy lifestyle and behavioral weight loss treatments, and we use precision functional and molecular brain imaging techniques to study individual, brain-based mechanisms of illness and treatment response. This elective offers the student a broad exposure to clinical research protocols, including protocols in adults and children. Students will have an opportunity to focus on a particular project of interest.

Students participate in clinical duties depending on assigned locations, which can include the BJH adult psychiatry clinic, a community mental health center, the Wash U child and adolescent psychiatry clinic, and both the adult and child psychiatry consultation services. Students will also submit a written review of a relevant clinical topic of their choice. There are no call obligations at any clinical site. Credit 77 units. M85 Psych 805 Psychiatry Consult Subinternship Students spend four weeks on the psychiatry consult service at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. Under the supervision of house staff and attending physicians, students participate in the evaluation and collaborative management of inpatients on medical and surgical units for a broad range of psychiatric and behavioral concerns. They learn about the intersection between psychiatry and other medical specialties and important skills for collaborative patient care. Students attend departmental conferences and other educational sessions, and they also prepare and present a clinical topical review of their choice M85 Psych 810 Outpatient Community Psychiatry This elective will provide the student with a significant outpatient experience in Psychiatry. Students will be paired with a Resident physician and have exposure to two adult clinics and one child clinic over the course of the rotation. Students will observe and assist in the diagnosis and treatment of patients in the clinic setting. Students will also attend scheduled lectures and conferences over the course of the rotation relevant to outpatient Psychiatry. During the elective, the student will learn about the outpatient presentations of psychiatric disorders, a variety of treatment techniques (psychotherapy and psychopharmacology), and general principles of outpatient clinical management. M85 Psych 836 Inpatient Psychiatry Subinternship This is a senior rotation that provides the students with an opportunity to expand their knowledge of inpatient clinical psychiatry by functioning as interns. Students attend all staffing and teaching conferences given to first-year psychiatry residents and are responsible for the assessment and management of acute psychiatric patients. Immediate supervision is provided by the inpatient attending, and additional supervision can be arranged as desired. Teaching emphasis is directed toward psychiatric diagnosis, appropriate use of psychopharmacologic agents, psychotherapeutic intervention, use of community resources and pursuit of the psychiatric scientific literature. The student will write a self-selected clinical topic relevant to treatment and management of psychiatric inpatients. M85 Psych 840 Child Psychiatry This elective in child psychiatry utilizes the St. Louis Children's Hospital St. Louis Children's Hospital Pediatric Behavioral Health Unit and the Consult-Liaison service. It provides experience in age-appropriate diagnostic and treatment methods in children and adolescents. A portion of your time may be spent in the outpatient clinics if interested and if circumstances permit. A paper on a topic of the student's choosing is required. 306Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) M85 Psych 844 Forensic Psychiatry The medical student will be actively involved in many aspects of forensic psychiatry including civil litigation, workman's compensation, malpractice, civil commitment, and guardianship. There may be opportunities to be involved in criminal forensic issues. The rotation is primarily self-directed but the student will work with several faculty within the Department of Psychiatry and will meet with the Course Director a minimum of two hours per week. They will also work with The City of St Louis Probate Court and shadow at the St. Louis Psychiatric Rehabilitation Center, a nearby forensic hospital. The student will also be assigned readings of landmark cases, textbooks, psychiatric expert opinions, legal filing with the probate court and attend civil hearings. The student will learn relevant criminal statutes regarding competency and civil commitment, causation in civil litigation, the concept of medical malpractice and risk assessment of violence and suicide. There may be the opportunity to witness sexually violent predator evaluations and/ or treatment. The student will be required to research and write an opinion on a specific approved topic in forensic psychiatry. The objectives will be measured by attendance and by formal evaluation of the student's participation and knowledge during the supervision discussion. It will also be determined by the originality, thoroughness, and quality of the research paper. M85 Psych 880 Schizophrenia Precursors & Prodomal States This is an opportunity for trainees to gain experience in the evaluation of children and adolescents who may be at high risk for schizophrenia. The rotation would center around the \"First Contact Assessment Service\", which evaluates patients who show characteristics suggestive of prodromal schizophrenia (such as new-onset attenuated psychotic symptoms along with recent deterioration in functioning) and/or early life characteristics that may indicate risk for developing schizophrenia later in life (for example, nonspecific social/emotional/behavioral symptoms in a child/adolescent with a strong family history of schizophrenia). Since the full symptoms of schizophrenia are often preceded by a wide range of childhood behavioral and developmental abnormalities, this rotation would also help trainees integrate information regarding the continuity between childhood development and adult psychopathology. Trainee would observe all aspects of First Contact evaluations (including semi-structured diagnostic interviews and examination of subtle neurological signs), participate in case discussions, and observe follow-up consultations involving patients with psychotic and/or complex neurodevelopmental disorders. Trainee would also be required to write a literature review on a topic relevant to the rotation. M85 Psych 900 Research Elective: Psychiatry Research opportunities may be available.

Radiology Research Electives During the fourth year, opportunities exist for many varieties of advanced clinical or research experiences. Interested students should contact the appropriate individual in each division regarding the types of research projects available. David Ballard, MD (https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/persons/ david-ballard/ ) Abdominal Imaging Section, Mallinckrodt Institute Radiology Phone: 314-362-2928 davidballard@wustl.edu Dr. Ballard's lab is engaged in clinical and translation 3D printing research with 3D-printed models for procedural planning, medical devices, and medical devices/implants impregnated with bioactive compounds. He is also active in clinical research in a broad scope of abdominal malignancies and infectious processes. Dr. Ballard is willing to mentor trainees and students at all levels for research in clinical 3D printing, translational 3D printing, clinical radiology, and radiology education. Tom Conturo, MD, PhD East Building, 2nd Floor, Rm 2120 Phone: 314-362-8421 325Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a noninvasive means of providing images of the human body at high spatial resolution and contrast sensitivity. The contrast can be manipulated to depend on different properties of tissue water, enabling the study of a variety of biological processes. In some cases, endogenous or exogenous paramagnetic MR contrast agents are used to alter the MRI contrast by perturbing the tissue water environment. Recently, new MRI hardware has also enabled techniques having high temporal resolution. Using the unique contrast properties of MRI and the higher spatial/temporal resolution, noninvasive techniques can be devised to study neuronal activity, tissue perfusion, water mobility (diffusion), and neuronal fiber pathways in the human brain. The goals of Dr. Conturo's research lab are to develop and apply MR imaging techniques for quantitative imaging of cerebral perfusion, brain function, water diffusion, and neuronal fiber pathways. These techniques utilize the MR signal effects of exogenous bolus-injected contrast agents, endogenous hemoglobin, and microscopic water diffusion. Long-term goals are to apply these methodologies toward imaging and understanding tissue structure, function, and physiology in the brain and other organs in normal and abnormal conditions. The approaches that are used in this laboratory cover a broad range of areas, including MRI physics, MRI pulse sequence development, theoretical derivations, computer simulations, image-processing, computer graphics, custom contrast agent design and syntheois, phantom studies, animal models, human studies, clinical patient studies, and comparison with other imaging modalities. Farrokh Dehdashti, MD Nuclear Medicine PET Facility, 10th Floor, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology Phone: 314-362-1474 Positron emission tomography (PET) is an imaging technique that produces images reflective of biochemical processes of normal and abnormal tissues. PET is complementary to anatomic imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The ability of PET to quantify fundamental processes, such as blood flow, oxygen metabolism, glucose metabolism, and receptor density, makes this technique very desirable to both investigators and clinicians. Dr. Dehdashti's research utilizes the conventional PET radiopharmaceutical, F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), as well as a variety of unique PET radiopharmaceuticals such as Cu-64-diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (Cu-64 ATSM), 18F-labeled 3'-deoxy-3'fluorothymidine (FLT), a proliferative imaging tracer. Below is a partial list of the research projects relating to PET: (1) PET assessment of progesterone receptors in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer with a new progesterone-receptor imaging tracer, 21-[18F]Fluoro-16,17- [(R)-1'-furylmethylidene)dioxy]-19-norpregn-4-ene-3,20 dione (FFNP); (2) assessment of cell proliferation with a new tracer, N-(4-(6,7-dimethoxy-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2(1H)-yl)butyl)-2(2-[18F]-fluoroethoxy)-5-methylbenzamide ([18F]3c), also called [18F]ISO-1 by imaging sigma receptors in patients with various solid cancers; (3) PET assessment of tumor hypoxia using 64Cu-ATSM in patients with cervical cancer (the major goal of this project is to predict prognosis); (4) FDG-PET/CT study in cervical cancer to evaluate the change in tumor FDG heterogeneity and SUVmax during chemoradiation and whether these changes are predictive of response to therapy; (5) PET using [18F]FHBG (9-[4-fluoro-3-hydroxymethyl-butyl]guanine), analog of Penciclovir, an acycloguanosine derivative and antiviral drug, for possible tracking of GvHD in patients who were prior recipients of unrelated allogeneic bone marrow transplant for any hematologic malignancy; and (6) FLT-PET/CT to assess tumor cell proliferation in patient must have histologically or cytologically confirmed ER+ stage IV or metastatic invasive breast cancer. Rob J. Gropler, MD East Building, Room 1307 Phone: 314-747-3878 The focus of our lab is on cardiovascular imaging research. The research in the Cardiovascular Imaging Laboratory is designed to better understand the relationship between myocardial perfusion, intermediary metabolism and mechanical function in both normal and abnormal cardiac states. The research involves the integration of several imaging techniques with diverse strengths such as PET, MRI, CT and echocardiography. The success of the research requires several paths of investigation to be pursued in parallel. For example, in order to image the biologic processes of interest requires continued technical developments for each of the imaging methods listed above. There are ongoing efforts to permit more accurate PET measurements of myocardial substrate metabolism. They include the development of novel tracers of extracted substrates, the development of acquisition schemes to assess endogenous substrate metabolism, and the validation of mathematical approaches to correlate the tracer kinetics with the underlying metabolic processes. These studies are being pursued in small and large animal models and then in humans. Another example includes the current efforts to develop approaches to image the coronary arteries noninvasively by MRI using novel contrast agents and acquisition schemes. In addition, techniques are being developed to permit MR guided interventions on the coronary arteries. This undertaking includes the development of novel guide-wire tracking and catheter tracking schemes using both passive and active approaches. Finally, to permit assessments of myocardial oxygenation and thus, perfusion, techniques are being developed to permit BOLD imaging the myocardium. Another path of the research is to determine how this perfusional-metabolic-functional relation is altered by normal life changes and then determine how disease states alter the relationship. For example, both PET and echocardiography are being used to characterize the age- and gender-related changes on myocardial perfusion, substrate metabolism and function. 326Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) To study the relationship in disease states, similar studies are being performed in patients with diabetes and obesity. A third path is to determine the mechanisms responsible for these changes in this metabolic-functional relation and identify potential interventions that may reverse or ameliorate them. In this regard, similar imaging studies are being performed to determine the importance of nitric oxide and the PPARa system in defining this metabolic-functional relation. Stephen M. Moerlein, PharmD, PhD East Building, 1st Floor Phone: 314-362-8466 Our research interests lie in the general area of labeled tracer development for nuclear medicine imaging, especially positron- emission tomography (PET). Developmental effort begins with synthesis of target structures, preclinical screening that involves in vitro biochemistry and pharmacological testing, and ex vivo biodistribution studies in small animals. Promising tracers are then examined by in vivo imaging of animal subjects and tracer kinetic modeling. The final step in the transition of a radiochemical into a labeled drug takes into account radiation dosimetry, pharmaceutical quality, and the development of automated production and GMP production processes to streamline delivery to human subjects. Each of these aspects of radiopharmaceutical development are investigated, with a primary emphasis in novel agents for evaluation of pathological processes in neurology and oncology. Marc Raichle, MD East Building, 2nd Floor Phone: 314-362-6907 We use functional imaging techniques \u2014 both positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging \u2014 to study the normal organization of the human brain and the effect of selected diseases. The research focuses on both the methodology (imaging and experimental) and specific questions in cognitive neuroscience.

For the most up-to-date medical student research opportunities, please visit the Research page of the Department of Surgery website (https://surgery.wustl.edu/research/ ). Section of Minimally Invasive Surgery 660 S. Euclid, Box 8109 Phone: 314-454-8877 Under the direction of L. Michael Brunt, MD, students may investigate minimally invasive gastrointestinal and hernia surgery. The minimum rotation length is four weeks. Under the auspices of the Section of Minimally Invasive Surgery and the Washington University Institute for Minimally Invasive Surgery, a number of surgeons are investigating outcomes of various minimally invasive surgical approaches to abdominal wall hernias, benign foregut disorders, bariatric surgery and cholecystectomy. Dr. Brunt is currently investigating the clinical outcomes and standardization of various laparoscopic surgical procedures, opioid prescribing patterns and opioid use in surgical patients, and education-related research and skills training for medical students planning to enter a surgical internship. Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery 660 S. Euclid, Box 8238 Phone: 314-747-0541 The Division of Plastic Surgery offers many opportunities for research projects on various topics related to plastic surgery. A project will be designed with students prior to their rotation on plastic surgery so that all of the materials and methods will be available at the beginning of the rotation. The basic science laboratories primarily investigate nerve injury and regeneration, including nerve transplantation. Students will be encouraged to design and complete their own research study during the elective. The minimum rotation length is six weeks. The research rotation can be conducted in the plastic surgery laboratories under the direction of Drs. Moore, Snyder- Warwick, Wood or Mackinnon . Ongoing projects include the following: The influence of the immune system on nerve regeneration; Neural tissue engineering and regenerative medicine therapeutics, such as electrical stimulation to promote tissue regeneration The investigation of glial cells at the neuromuscular junction during development, maintenance, aging, and after nerve injuryAdditional clinical and educational research opportunities in various fields of plastic surgery are available with Drs. Fox, Myckatyn, Patel, Tung, and Woo. These various projects include the following: In vivo tissue generation and tissue differentiation The mechanical, structural and biochemical effects of stress on scar tissue maturation In vivo anatomy of craniofacial deformities Outcome analysis of methods of cleft lip and palate management Breast reconstruction (3D imaging of breasts after cosmetic or reconstructive surgery, interpretation of angiograms of the breast to measure nipple perfusion) The use of nerve transfer to improve hand function in patients with cervical spinal cord injury/quadriplegia Surgical education (specifically web-based multimedia strategies for peripheral nerve surgery education) The Department of Surgery can host Washington University medical students in any of its labs either to receive credit for a class they are currently enrolled in or to add them into the system as Washington University student employees to be paid for their time worked. Student work may be obtained through the Federal Work-Study program, the Office of Medical Student Research, or direct communication initiated by the student with faculty they wish to work alongside on specific subjects of interest with the goal of furthering their education. This can occur during any year of a medical student's education. Courses Visit online course listings to view offerings for M95 Surgery (https://courses.wustl.edu/CourseInfo.aspx?sch=M&dept=M95).

The Research Integrity Committee will promptly investigate the charges and report its conclusions and recommendations to the dean, who will refer the issue to the Committee on the Academic and Professional Evaluation of Students (CAPES) as a breach of professional integrity if further action is warranted. For further information, visit the Research Integrity Policy (https:// research.wustl.edu/washington-university-research-integrity- policy/) posted on the Washington University website. Social Media Policy Students accepted to Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) and current WUSM should be vigilant in their use of social networking (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, blogging). The profession of medicine requires the highest standards of conduct because of the level of trust patients place in medical professionals. When students are admitted to WUSM, enrollment remains contingent on their demonstration of this high standard of conduct through sound judgment, accountability and integrity. Written, voice, email and other electronic communications \u2014 including those used in blogs, social media sites and smart phone apps, as well as in published writing \u2014 should be thoughtful, and all individuals in the learning environment should be treated with mutual respect and understanding. Posting items that represent unprofessional behavior, releasing patient health information or other HIPAA violations, or violating Washington University in St. Louis policies on social networking sites will result in disciplinary action by the medical school. The following two Washington University policies are incorporated into this policy and apply to accepted and current students: Washington University Social Media Policy (https://wustl.edu/ about/compliance-policies/media-policies/social-media- policy/) WUSM Social Media Guidelines (https://medicine.wustl.edu/ brand/social-media/ )Guidelines Governing Alcohol Service at Events Sponsored by Student Organizations at the Washington University School of Medicine I. General Principle on Alcohol Service at Events Sponsored by Graduate and Professional Students and Organizations at Washington University in St. Louis Washington University in St. Louis (WashU) has adopted a Drug and Alcohol Policy (http://hr.wustl.edu/policies/Pages/ DrugandAlcoholPolicy.aspx ) reinforcing our commitment to an education, work, living and patient care environment that is free of alcohol and drug abuse. Given our mission to support personal and public health, students of the School of Medicine (WUSM) have a particular responsibility to recognize alcohol impairment and the potentially dire social, physiological and psychological consequences of substance use and abuse. For information regarding the effects of alcohol and drug use and abuse and to learn about available counseling services, please consult the School of Medicine's Student and Occupational Health Services (https://wusmhealth.wustl.edu/students/ ). As adults, students are expected to know and abide by all applicable state and federal laws and university policies and procedures. State law makes it illegal for a person under the age of 21 years old to purchase, attempt to purchase, or possess any intoxicating liquor. Violation can subject an individual to a fine between $50 and $1,000 and/or imprisonment for a maximum term of one year. County and municipality ordinances contain similar prohibitions and sanctions. WashU expects its students and community members to exercise responsible decision making if they choose to include alcohol as part of their activities, including making sound judgments about whether, when, and how much to drink. Individual students are responsible for their own behavior and will be held to university and school policies should their behavior not conform to standards of conduct. Individuals may also be referred for criminal prosecution. If a student organization provides alcohol as part of an event, student organizers share in the responsibility of providing a safe environment for all attendees and must prioritize the safety, health, and well-being of participants when planning and hosting an event. Student organizations may also be held accountable for the actions of their members through university and school policies. 354Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) Student organizations are expected to follow the guidelines below when hosting events with alcohol. Individual schools and certain venues retain the discretion to impose additional guidelines on student organizations and events. For more information, contact the Office of Medical Student Affairs (https:// md.wustl.edu/resources/offices-and-contacts/office-of-medical- student-affairs/ ) or the student services office of the applicable WUSM program. II. Event Protocols A. Registration 1.Any on- or off-campus event sponsored by a recognized student organization of the school or the university as a whole must comply with the Drug and Alcohol Policy of Washington University in St. Louis, the procedures set forth in these guidelines, and all other applicable university policies. 2.Any on-campus event involving alcohol funded in part by the Office of Medical Student Affairs or by the applicable WUSM student services office and not sponsored by the school itself must be sponsored by a recognized student organization. 3.All events with alcohol need to be registered with and approved by the Office of Medical Student Affairs or the student services office of the applicable WUSM program. Depending on the nature and location of the event, approval from multiple departments within the university or school may be required. Approval for the event should be obtained no less than one week before the event is scheduled to take place. Failure to obtain approval for an event with alcohol during this time frame will likely lead to the event being rescheduled or cancelled. An event may not be publicized until it is approved by the Office of Medical Student Affairs or the student services office of the applicable WUSM program and any other applicable department (e.g., Protective Services). 4.To register an event, an event registration form (https:// meet.wustl.edu/services/catering/catering-alcohol- guidelines/) must be submitted to the Office of Medical Student Affairs or the student services office of the applicable WUSM program no less than two weeks before the proposed event. B. Marketing 1.Organizations may not plan events that promote or encourage the consumption of alcohol as the main focus of the event. The theme of all events at which alcohol is served must be primarily social, cultural or educational. Alcohol may be implied in campus advertising of the event to graduate and professional students using conventional phrases such as \"happy hour\" or \"cocktail reception.\" 2.Student organization events marketed and open to the general public or to undergraduate students are not permitted to include alcohol.3.Persons planning events should remember that the vast majority of events at WashU take place without alcohol, that most members of the undergraduate community are not of legal drinking age, and that many members of our community do not drink alcohol beverages at all. 4.The following are examples of prohibited depictions of excessive alcohol consumption in the advertisement or promotion of events: Excessive or underage consumption or use of alcoholic beverages All-you-can-drink activities Drinking games Price specials on alcohol Promotions or prizes featuring alcohol C. Event Location 1.Student organizations should check in advance with the Office of Medical Student Affairs or the student services office of the applicable WUSM program, the WUSM Operations & Facilities Management Department (https:// facilities.med.wustl.edu/ ), Danforth Event Management (https://eventmanagement.wustl.edu/ ), or the appropriate WashU office for the reservation of specific event locations and any separate guidelines (including reservation deadlines) applicable to that space. Where separate guidelines are applicable and may conflict with the guidelines herein, the more restrictive guidelines should be followed. 2.When alcohol is permitted, the space must be secured (or, for outdoor locations, roped off as necessary) to ensure that proper admittance and alcohol distribution can be regulated easily and effectively. D. Alcohol Types 1.Only beer and wine are permitted. 2.Hard liquor \u2014 including (but not limited to) grain alcohol, punches and mixed drinks \u2014 is not permitted at events. 3.Glass bottles are not permitted on campus and are discouraged at off-campus venues. 4.Kegs or other bulk containers of alcoholic beverages are not permitted. E. Food and Alternative Beverages 1.Food must be provided at all events where alcohol is served. The food options must include plentiful and appetizing nonsalty foods that are readily available, free, and displayed in an attractive manner. 2.Nonalcoholic beverages, including water, should also be readily available and free. 3.The food and nonalcoholic beverages should be replenished several times throughout the event so that they are continuously available. 355Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) F. Distribution of Alcohol 1.In compliance with Missouri law and university policy, alcohol must be served in a controlled manner and may not be freely accessible. A central point of distribution must be designated to allow for proper identification. 2.Alcohol must not leave the confines of the event. The \"responsible contacts\" and security staff are responsible for ensuring that alcohol does not leave the event. 3.Under the law, no one who is under the age of 21 years or who is disorderly, disruptive, visibly intoxicated, or known to be a \"habitual drunkard\" may be served. 4.Regardless of who is managing distribution, the age of all attendees must be verified. Acceptable forms of identification are limited to the following: (1) a current driver's license from any U.S. state; (2) a U.S. military identification card; (3) a state of Missouri special identification card; or (4) a passport. Please note that a foreign driver's license and a special identification card from a state other than Missouri are not acceptable forms of identification. 5.If the server is not checking identification before serving each drink and if persons under 21 years old are permitted at the event, those guests who are 21 years old or older must be designated with a wristband or otherwise in a clear manner that is not easily replicated. For example, it is not permissible to mark hands with a marker or pen. 6.Those who serve alcohol and those who check proof of age and identification for any event may not consume or be under the influence of alcohol during the event. 7.Only one drink at a time may be served to each person. Each drink is not to exceed 12 ounces of beer or 5 ounces of wine. Guests are limited to a total maximum of one drink for each hour of the event (e.g., if the event lasts three hours, a guest may be served three drinks over the entirety of the event). 8.Alcohol distribution must conclude 30 minutes before the event ends. 9.Options for distribution must be discussed with and approved by the Office of Medical Student Affairs or the student services office of the applicable WUSM program. Depending on the nature and location of the event, options may include the following: a.Student organization servers: Student organization members may order, set up, and control distribution of the alcohol at the event independently in compliance with these guidelines if attendance is less than 40 guests, including members of the sponsoring organization(s). Prior to the event, the student organization must designate which member(s) will act as server(s). Servers must always be present at the location where the alcohol is provided in order to monitor guests' consumption andto ensure that no persons under the age of 21 years receive alcohol. The practice of \"self-serve,\" in which individual guests serve themselves from a common container or source, is prohibited. b.Third-party bartenders: Student organization members may purchase alcohol, and a third-party bartending company with the requisite liquor license or permit may set up and control distribution of the alcohol at the event. Bartenders will be responsible for checking the identification of the guests. c.Third-party caterers: Student organizations may contract with a third-party vendor with the requisite insurance and liquor license or permit (e.g., Bon Appetit (http://wusm.cafebonappetit.com/catering/), Aramark) to acquire, set up, and control distribution of the alcohol at the event, including checking the identification of the guests. Some university event spaces require a third- party caterer to be used for the service of alcohol or food. Student organizers must check policies and guidelines in advance with the Office of Medical Student Affairs or the student services office of the applicable WUSM program, WUSM Facilities, Danforth Event Management, or the appropriate WashU office. If there is any possibility that event attendees may be less than 21 years old, student organizers must use option b or c to distribute alcohol. If alcohol is offered for sale (e.g., cash bar), if admission is charged, if donations are solicited to attend the event, or if money is otherwise changing hands between the guests and the organization for the event (e.g., charge for cups or glasses, charge for tickets), then the distribution of alcohol may only be provided through option c. 10.Off-campus events: If an event is held at an off-campus venue and alcohol is being provided by the student organization, the student organization must use option c, unless such service is provided by the venue. The owner of the event space must assume liability for the event, and the owner or caterer must have the requisite liquor permit and acceptable liability insurance. Organizations should check with the Office of Medical Student Affairs or the student services office of the applicable WUSM program to ensure that all requirements are understood. 11.The selling of alcohol may not be used as a fundraiser for the sponsoring organization. 356Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) G. Drinking Games and Other Games of Chance 1.There may be no games of chance, drinking games, contests, or other similar activities that induce, encourage, or result in the consumption of alcohol. Examples include but are not limited to beer pong, flip cup, kings, caps, Jenga, quarters, or other games in which binge drinking is encouraged. H. Responsible Contacts 1.At least one individual from the student organization per 25 attendees must be designated as a \"responsible contact\" for the event. More responsible contacts may be required based on the size, type and location of the event. Training for those wanting to serve as responsible contacts is available through the Office of Medical Student Affairs or the student services office of the applicable WUSM program. 2.Responsible contacts are not to consume or be under the influence of any alcohol prior to or during any portion of the event, including setup and cleanup. The responsible contacts must remain the same individuals throughout the entire event. These individuals are responsible for overseeing and ensuring the safety of the event, the distribution of alcohol, and the implementation of this policy throughout the entire event. 3.Responsible contacts are required to introduce themselves to the security guards, the venue representatives and WashU Protective Services. One responsible contact should serve as the primary liaison with these individuals/agencies. 4.Responsible contacts should monitor the consumption of alcohol by guests and take appropriate action by calling the police for emergency medical services if any guest displays signs of intoxication and is in need of medical attention. 5.The responsible contacts must end an event during which these guidelines are not being followed or other significant problems arise that jeopardize the security of the event or the safety of students. Security staff or Protective Services should be available to assist with closing down an event per the contacts' request. University staff may close an event at any time if the security of the event is jeopardized or if the safety of students is at risk. A university staff representative may be required to attend large-scale events. I. Attendance and Proper Identification 1.Participants who intend to consume alcohol must show proof of minimum drinking age by presenting a government-issued photo identification. Washington University identification, driver's licenses, and state or federally issued identificationcards may be checked for validity at the point of entrance. Fake identification cards will be confiscated; students risk disciplinary action and/or referral to off-campus law enforcement authorities if they present false identification. 2.A line for admission should be in a well-lit area and well organized. A security guard may be responsible for checking proof of legal age and affixing wristbands. J. Guest Policy 1.For events at which guests are permitted, each WashU student is allowed to bring one guest. Students are responsible for the conduct of their guests, and guests must enter with their hosts. 2.Guest misconduct could lead to disciplinary action for the WashU student, and the guest could be subject to prosecution off campus. Verification of age and identity (i.e., driver's license or state or federally issued identification card) will be required of all attendees at the entrance to the event. K. WashU Police Department and WUSM Protective Services 1.The WashU Police Department (WUPD) or WUSM Protective Services should be notified of all on-campus programs for which alcohol has been requested. Such events may require the presence of officers or security guards or the implementation of other security measures. Costs associated with security will be the responsibility of the sponsoring organization. L. Security 1.Private security guards may be required to assist with the safety of participants and the security of the facility when total attendance involves more than 100 attendees, as determined by WUPD or WUSM Protective Services. For all events that require security, student organizations should anticipate that a minimum ratio of three guards plus one additional guard for every 50 attendees may be required. The sponsoring organization is responsible for contacting and arranging for guards or for ensuring that the venue provides appropriate security staff. 2.WUPD or WUSM Protective Services should be involved in planning for the most effective use of the contract security contingent prior to the event. An example of how guards may be stationed is as follows: At least one guard would be stationed at the main entrance of the event to check for WashU student identification, to monitor the guest policy, and to help determine if anyone who appears to be intoxicated should be refused entry. 357Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) A second guard would be assigned to the point of alcohol distribution and, depending on the security services provided, could monitor or check identification for proof of legal age and assist with pulling drink tabs from wristbands, if applicable. Other guard(s) would serve as roamer(s) and be responsible for monitoring legal drinking, access to event space, and all entrances. Additional guards may be required based on the nature of the event and the expected attendance. Security costs are the responsibility of the sponsoring organization. 3.Security staff must come from a licensed and bonded security company. However, some off-campus venues may prefer to have their own staff serve in this capacity. The security guards, bartenders, caterers or designated organization members (depending on the nature of the event) are required to verify the age of each participant with identification that provides the date of birth. If the event is held outdoors or in an unsecured area, distinct identification (e.g., wristband, stamp) is required to identify attendees who are 21 years old and older; this is to ensure that those passing through the event do not receive alcohol. M. Post-Event Cleanup 1.For any event on campus at which alcohol is being served, the student organization planning the event must make arrangements for custodial services when the space reservation is made. Service requests should include additional trash cans and recycling bins. Large events must have cleaning staff during the hours of the event to remove trash and clean restroom facilities. All expenses are the responsibility of the sponsoring organization. School of Medicine Programs Student Mistreatment Reporting and Monitoring Policy I. Student Mistreatment Definition As explained in our Abusive Conduct (https://hr.wustl.edu/items/ abusive-conduct-policy/ ) and Discrimination and Harassment (https://hr.wustl.edu/items/discrimination-harassment-policy/ ) policies, the School of Medicine is committed to maintaining an environment free from behavior that is abusive, discriminatory, or harassing or that involves the mistreatment of students or others in the learning and working environment. For definitions and examples of conduct that would be considered mistreatment prohibited by the university, please refer to these policies.This document identifies the mechanisms and protocols for students to report mistreatment against them or for other individuals to report student mistreatment they have observed. This document also outlines the systems in place aimed at monitoring, addressing, and preventing the mistreatment of students in the learning environment. II. Steps for Reporting Student Mistreatment The School of Medicine strongly encourages students who feel they have experienced mistreatment \u2014 and those who feel they have witnessed mistreatment of a student \u2014 to report it immediately, without fear of retaliation, using the following resources: 1.WashU Learner Mistreatment Form Students and other community members may submit a report through the WashU Learner Mistreatment Form (https://wustl.ethicspointvp.com/custom/wustl/forms/mgr/ form_data.asp?lang=en ), which can also be found on the Supporting a Fair Environment (SAFE) website (https:// sites.wustl.edu/safe/ ). Washington University Human Resources receives all reports and will direct these reports to appropriate university or hospital administrators for a prompt response. The reporting portal allows for individuals to submit concerns anonymously, if preferred, and it allows for bidirectional communication through the portal via a password, even if the report is submitted anonymously. 2.To any of the following administrators (noted per program): Medical Student Program Senior Associate Dean for Education (https:// education.med.wustl.edu/about/leadership-team/ ) Associate Dean for Student Affairs (https:// md.wustl.edu/resources/offices-and-contacts/ Associate Dean for Medical Student Education (https://md.wustl.edu/resources/offices-and- contacts/medical-student-education/ ) Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences Interim Associate Dean for Graduate Education (menneris@wustl.edu ) Executive Director of the Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences (cjeliti22@wustl.edu ) Director, Diversity, Equity & Inclusion and Student & Alumni Affairs (joeltdalton@wustl.edu ) Director, Curriculum and Graduate Programs (vigueira@wustl.edu ) Program in Occupational Therapy 358Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) Program Director (https://www.ot.wustl.edu/ about/our-people/lisa-tabor-connor-171/) Education Division Clinical Operations Director (https:// www.ot.wustl.edu/about/our-people/patricia- nellis-65/) Physical Therapy Student Program Program Director (https://pt.wustl.edu/people/ gammon-m-earhart-pt-phd-fapta/) Education Division Director (https://pt.wustl.edu/ people/steven-ambler-pt-dpt-phd-mph/ ) Associate Director of Professional Curriculum and Director of Clinical Education (https:// pt.wustl.edu/people/megan-m-burgess-pt-dpt- ocs/) Program in Audiology and Communication Sciences Director of Audiology Studies (https:// pacs.wustl.edu/contactus/ ) Director of Deaf Education Studies pacs.wustl.edu/contactus/) Director of Finance and Student/Academic Affairs (https://pacs.wustl.edu/contactus/ ) Confidentiality and Anonymous Reporting When receiving a confidential report, the university will strive to protect, to the greatest extent feasible, the confidentiality of persons reporting mistreatment and of those accused of mistreatment. Because of legal obligations, the university cannot guarantee complete confidentiality where it would conflict with the university's obligation to investigate meaningfully or, where warranted, to take corrective action. For example, if a report identifies conduct that would fall within Title IX (https:// hr.wustl.edu/items/discrimination-harassment-policy/ ), the university may have an obligation to investigate and take further action that requires disclosure of all or part of the information contained in the report to the person accused as well as to appropriate administrators. In addition, if a report identifies conduct that poses a significant threat to the health or safety of an individual, the university may also need to investigate and take further action that requires the disclosure of information contained in the report. Even when some disclosure of the university's information or sources is necessary, it will be limited to the extent possible. The university will keep confidential all records of complaints, responses, and investigations to the extent permitted by law.Anonymous reports may be submitted through the reporting portal. If a reporter wishes to remain anonymous, the university may be limited in its ability to respond and take action with respect to the report. III. Options for Possible Resolution Students who believe they have been subjected to mistreatment or other reporters who believe they have witnessed student mistreatment have several options available if they wish to seek resolution of a situation. At any time, they may consult with a Discrimination and Harassment Response Coordinator (see below), whose responsibilities include assisting students, faculty, and staff with questions regarding university policies and options for addressing concerns about mistreatment. If a student or reporter feels comfortable dealing with the situation without assistance, they can communicate either orally or in writing with the person whose behavior is of concern. The most useful communication clearly describes the conduct of concern as well as its impact on the student and a request that the behavior should stop. Frequently, such a communication will cause the behavior to stop, particularly when the person may not be aware of its impact. If a student or reporter would like to discuss a situation and possible options for resolution with the assistance of someone else, they may also consider the following: (1) asking a trained WUSM SAFE (Supporting A Fair Environment) Committee member to meet with them or to speak to the person whose behavior is of concern; or (2) consulting with one of the advisors listed below about other potential options to remedy the situation. As previously mentioned, these individuals may be obligated to report the incident or conduct disclosed to the university for further review (e.g., sexual assault or harassment, threat of harm to self or others). Students may also initiate a more formal complaint process, which could involve a committee hearing, by contacting a Discrimination and Harassment Response Coordinator. If it has not already done so, the university will initiate an investigation into the allegations under the appropriate policy and, if substantiated, take disciplinary action as contemplated by the applicable procedures. For example, if a student asserts that a faculty member has engaged in mistreatment in the form of sexual harassment, the university's Discrimination and Harassment Policy would be followed. The university will remain in communication with the student throughout the university's investigation and response. The university may be limited in its ability to disclose personnel information or other action taken in response to a complaint. The university will only be able to return communication made by anonymous reporters if the reporter creates a password and logs back into the reporting portal to access information about the incident. 359Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) IV. Monitoring and Education The School of Medicine will provide ongoing education to promote a respectful and positive learning environment. The purpose of this education will be to communicate the school's standards of behavior and professionalism for an optimal learning environment and to commit to informing students and educators about policies around behavioral expectations and processes for reporting mistreatment. The policies and reporting protocols will be posted in the Bulletin and in the course syllabi, and they will be reviewed with students during orientation. Data from the reports submitted to the portal and to the deans identified above will be aggregated for review by the SAFE Committee. The SAFE Committee will systematically review these data on a regular basis, in addition to internal and external survey data, when doing the following: (1) assessing trends and the overall climate in learning areas at the School of Medicine; (2) making any recommendations for changes to the policies and the reporting and response mechanisms in place; and (3) developing action plans to implement targeted educational interventions based on the data received. The SAFE committee will regularly report its findings and recommendations to the Academic Affairs Committee. Aggregate reports will also be regularly forwarded to program and/or department chairs for monitoring purposes. V. Student Advisors The following is a list of offices and advisors who may provide guidance when addressing some of the potential issues discussed in the above guidelines: Gender Equity and Title IX Compliance Office (https:// titleix.wustl.edu/) Discrimination and Harassment Response Coordinator (https://hr.wustl.edu/items/discrimination-harassment- policy/) School of Medicine Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (https://diversity.med.wustl.edu/ ) In addition, the following faculty advisors in each program may also be able to provide guidance: Medical Student Program Senior Associate Dean for Education (https:// education.med.wustl.edu/about/leadership-team/ ) Associate Dean for Student Affairs (https:// md.wustl.edu/resources/offices-and-contacts/ Associate Dean for ) Faculty Coaches (https://sites.wustl.edu/ gatewaycurriculum/curriculum-renewal-update- ) Education ) Physical Therapy Director (https://pt.wustl.edu/people/ gammon-m-earhart-pt-phd-fapta/) Education Division Director (https://pt.wustl.edu/ people/steven-ambler-pt-dpt-phd-mph/ ) Associate Director of Professional Curriculum and Director of Clinical Education (https:// pt.wustl.edu/people/megan-m-burgess-pt-dpt- ocs/) Program in Audiology and Communication Sciences Director of Audiology Studies (https:// pacs.wustl.edu/contactus/ ) Director of Deaf Education Studies Director of Finance and Student/Academic Affairs (https://pacs.wustl.edu/contactus/ ) VI.

All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Academic Affairs Committee. 360Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) Student Health & Safety Policies Bloodborne Pathogens Policy In 1992, the Executive Faculty of the School of Medicine formally adopted a Medical Campus policy on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. This policy was updated in 2001 to include hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. The purpose of the policy is to provide guidelines to prevent or reduce the transmission of these infectious agents between patients and health care workers. It is an ethical and moral obligation for students/employees to report bloodborne pathogen infections. The policy deals with the following: (1) the university's responsibilities to infected patients, including obligation to treat, confidentiality, and appropriate serologic testing; (2) appropriate health and safety precautions and procedures for faculty, students and staff, including compliance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, blood and body fluid precautions, and handling of needles or sharp instruments; and (3) the university's responsibilities to faculty, staff or students who are infected with HIV, HBV or HCV, including admission to medical school, participation in clinical rotations, serologic testing confidentiality, and medical treatment. The policy makes a distinction between Category I activities (those involving no risk of transmission from infected health care workers to patients, such as routine history/physical examinations, minor surface suturing, and elective phlebotomy), Category II activities (those for which bloodborne virus transmission is theoretically possible but unlikely, such as minor local procedures, central venous lines, and other specialty procedures), and Category III activities (those for which there is a definite risk of bloodborne virus transmission, such as general surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, neurosurgery, and other surgeries as well as nonelective procedures performed in the emergency department). In 2012, a committee was formed that included representation from Administration, Legal - Risk Management, Infectious Disease, Occupational Health, and Student Health Services. The Student Health Services director meets with infected students and discusses the need for restricted activities and proper follow- up.Needle Stick/Human Blood and Body Fluid Exposure Policy All exposures to human blood and body fluids must be reported immediately to the Student Health Service, which maintains a 24-hour reporting system. During working hours (8 a.m.-4 p.m.), the office can be reached at 314-362-3523. After hours, the Student Health Service can be contacted through a digital beeper at 314-871-2966. Needle Stick Procedure Cleanse the wound immediately with soap and water. If a mucous membrane has been exposed, rinse with copious amounts of water. 1.Identify the source of exposure. 2.Call the Student Health Service for further instructions. The source patient will be evaluated for HIV, HBV and HCV. The physician in charge of the case is responsible for acquiring patient consent for testing. The employee will notify the physician. All source patient charges will be the responsibility of the Student Health Service. 3.Complete the Injury/Exposure Report form. 4.Employees and students will report to the Student Health Service for follow-up. Individuals will be evaluated for the following: a.HIV or serum sample save b.HBV vaccination c.Hepatitis B surface antibody testing (a positive test in the past eliminates the need for further testing) d.HCV vaccination e.Tetanus and diphtheria vaccination f.Postexposure prophylaxis Human Blood and Body Fluid Exposures Procedure 1.Clean the area with soap and water. 2.Call the Student Health Service at 314-362-3523. After hours, call the digital beeper (314-871-2966). 3.Keep the source or patient available for HIV, HBV and HCV testing. 4.Follow the instructions given by the Student Health Service. Complete an incident report. Always wear Personal Protective Equipment! MD Program Policies and Guidelines Policies for All MD Students 361Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) MD: Medical Student Access to Healthcare Services Policy Background The Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), per element 12.4, expects that a medical school provides its medical students with timely access to needed diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic health services at sites in reasonable proximity to the locations of their required educational activities and has policies and procedures in place that permit students to be excused from educational activities to seek needed care. This LCME requirement is aligned with Washington University School of Medicine's (WUSM) dedication to providing access to support and high-quality care for the physical, emotional and mental well-being of its students. To achieve this, the Student Health Services team provides students at WUSM with efficient, accessible, high-quality care, without undue financial burden, in order to prevent and treat health problems that may interfere with a student's educational and professional goals while attending WUSM. The Student Health Services Office is located on the Medical School Campus and provides a full range of primary care medical, mental health, health promotion and wellness services. The staff consists of physicians, nurses, psychologists, and administrative support for those clinicians. Policies In order to access these health services, medical students will be excused from classes or clinical activities. The following procedures will be followed: A. Student responsibility 1.The student is responsible for notifying the office of the relevant director of the educational activity (e.g., the clerkship director) and, if applicable, the supervising clinician of their clinical team as soon as possible. This is for both routine preventative appointments and acute incidents. 2.For additional details regarding student responsibilities in the event of a planned or unplanned absence for students on clinical courses, please refer to the Absence Policy for Medical Students on Clinical Rotations (p. 394). B. Responsibility of directors of required educational activities (e.g., the clerkship director) 1.Directors will work with students to ensure that students can access healthcare services in a timely manner and as needed. 2.If a student encounters any barrier to timely access to necessary health services, they are to notify the Associate Dean for Student Affairs or Ombuds. The Associate Dean for Student Affairs will address the concern with the clinical or course director and take appropriate action.The Washington University School of Medicine Medical Student Access to Healthcare Services Policy was last approved by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Education on March 2, 2020. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Education. MD: Clinical Supervision Policy for Medical Students on Clinical Rotations Background Part of Washington University School of Medicine's mission is to develop and maintain excellent clinical programs to provide outstanding care. To fulfill this mission as an academic teaching hospital, we have created this clinical supervision policy to direct our clinical health care teams with the oversight of our medical students. LCME Standards 9.2 and 9.3 require that a medical school ensure members of the school's faculty provide supervision of medical student learning experiences throughout required clerkships. Furthermore, we must ensure that medical students in clinical learning situations involving patient care are appropriately supervised at all times to ensure patient and student safety. We must also ensure that the level of responsibility delegated to the student is appropriate to their level of training and that the activities supervised are within the scope of practice of the supervising health professional. For the purposes of this policy, the following definitions will be used. Direct supervision will mean that the supervising physician is physically present (or continually on virtual telehealth visits) with the student and the patient. Indirect supervision will mean that the supervising physician is not physically (or continually on virtual telehealth visits) present with the student and the patient but is immediately available to provide direct supervision (or to join the telehealth visit) upon request, thus requiring that the supervising physician remain physically present within the hospital or other site of patient care. The supervising physician may include any member of the physician healthcare team, including residents, fellows, and attending physicians. There are also some situations in which it is appropriate that direct supervision be provided by a nurse or other healthcare provider, so long as the specific clinical activity falls within their scope of practice as specified below. Policies Supervision of medical student learning experiences involving patient care is provided on clerkships and other clinical courses by members of the school's faculty. Faculty oversee the clinical curriculum by setting expectations for appropriate physician healthcare team members about the level of student supervision required with patient care activities and the level of responsibility delegated to the student. Course directors 362Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) are responsible for communicating supervision requirements according to a student's level of training to members of the physician healthcare team. These teams are made aware of student clinical expectations, the level of student supervision, and the level of responsibility given to a student according to the student's level of training. Supervision will need to be defined by the clinical environment and patient care activity. Below are several examples of types of patient care activities. Physical Exam Students will be equipped with the basic skills necessary to perform general physical exam techniques commensurate with their level of training as they enter the clinical training environment. At the discretion of the physician healthcare team and in accordance with course-specific guidelines, students are able to perform general physical exam techniques under indirect supervision, excluding techniques defined as \"sensitive.\" Some physical exam skills are considered sensitive and will always need to be performed under the direct observation of a chaperone who is the same gender as the patient, even if the physician healthcare team determines that the student is capable of performing these exams under indirect supervision. These include \u2014 but are not restricted to \u2014 external genitalia exam on any patient, rectal exam on any patient, and breast exam on any person identifying as female. Infant external genital exams can be performed under indirect supervision without a chaperone at the discretion of the supervising physician. Pelvic examinations must always be performed under the direct supervision of a member of the physician healthcare team. Please refer to the \"Patient's Rights\" policy for additional information regarding pelvic bimanual exams performed when the patient is under anesthesia. Procedures Students may not perform procedures without direct supervision by a member of the physician healthcare team or another health professional so long as the procedure is within that professional's scope of practice (e.g., a nurse supervising a venipuncture). If any member of the physician healthcare team has concerns about violations of the Clinical Supervision Policy, they are to contact the course director for immediate investigation of the situation. The course director is responsible for notifying the Office of Medical Student Education of any suspected violations of the Clinical Supervision Policy. Students will not be down- graded or in any other way penalized for reporting concerns about suspected violations of the Clinical Supervision Policy.Guidelines If a student has concerns about a lack of clinical supervision, they are encouraged to discuss this with either the course director or the Office of Medical Student Education. If the issue is not resolved to satisfaction, the student can then approach the Associate Dean for Student Affairs, the Senior Associate Dean for Education, or the Office of the Ombuds for WUSM. The Washington University School of Medicine Clinical Supervision Policy for Medical Students on Clinical Rotations was last approved by the Academic Affairs Committee on June 11, 2020. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Academic Affairs Committee. MD: Duty Hour Policy for Medical Students on Clerkships and Other Clinical Rotations Background Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) is committed to the creation of effective learning environments that balance the importance of meaningful participation in clinical activities with the need to support equilibrium among student clinical responsibilities, learning, and personal health and well-being. The following policies and guidelines are set taking into account the effects of fatigue and sleep deprivation on learning and patient care. In keeping with Standard 8.8 of the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, clerkship directors, directors of clinical electives, and the Office of Medical Student Education are responsible for monitoring duty hours and ensuring that these are adjusted as necessary. Duty hours are defined as all clinical and required academic activities related to medical student education, including patient care (both inpatient and outpatient), administrative duties (e.g., completion of paperwork, dictation of charts), the provision of the transfer of patient care (e.g., check- in, check-out), time spent in-house while on call, and scheduled academic activities (i.e., required academic conferences). Time spent in self-directed study or practice performed after the student has left the hospital (or after the student has been told that they can leave) does not count toward duty hours. Policies Students must not be scheduled for more than 80 clinical duty hours during a seven-day week, averaged over a four- week period. Students must have a minimum of four periods of 24 consecutive hours off over four weeks. Note: Official WUSM school breaks and holidays should not be counted toward this minimum time-off requirement. Weekends that are adjacent to holidays (e.g., Labor Day) are not considered official holidays. 363Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) Students must not be on overnight call more frequently than every third night. Overnight shifts that do not extend a student's duty hours during the workday, such as those that might occur in Emergency Medicine or Obstetrics, are not included. Students must have access to call room facilities during overnight call shifts that extend a student's duty hours during the workday. Students cannot be on call for more than 24 successive hours, with an added period of up to four hours for continuity, educational debriefing, and didactic activities. No new patients should be assigned to students after the 24-hour call limit. Students must have at least 14 hours off from clinical work and required educational activities following 24 hours of in- house call. Students will have at least 10 hours off between scheduled work periods, including all activities within the definition of duty hours above. All students on clinical rotations will have all official Washington University holidays off, regardless of whether the student's team is on-call or post-call the day of the holiday. On the workday immediately preceding the holiday, students will be dismissed by 5 p.m. and will not be assigned call duties or regular clinical duties until the day immediately following the holiday at the time set forth by the clerkship director, chief resident, or clinical elective director. In the case of clerkships/rotations with evening or night shifts, an equivalent amount of time off will be provided in as immediate proximity to the holiday as is possible to minimize additional loss of clinical exposure. All clerkship students are to be excused from clinical duties by 5 p.m. on the evening before they are scheduled to take an assigned National Board of Medical Examiners subject exam. Please refer to the Clinical Absence Policy (p. 362) for additional details regarding excused time off from clinical duties. Individual clerkship directors and directors of clinical electives may choose to implement duty hour guidelines that are more restrictive than the above. However, duty hours may not exceed the above regulations. If a student has concerns about duty hour violations, they should discuss it first with the clerkship director or the director of the clinical elective. If the issue is not resolved to the student's satisfaction, they may approach the Associate Dean for Medical Student Education, the Associate Dean for Student Affairs, or the Office of the Ombuds for WUSM.Guidelines It is strongly suggested that clerkship directors and directors of clinical electives take into consideration additional student workload created by required assignments or other required learning activities when monitoring student duty hours. Examples include but are not limited to e-learning activities, required writing assignments, and quizzes. Duty hours data will be collected via end-of-clerkship course evaluations and clinical elective course evaluations, which are completed by students after each clerkship and clinical elective. Clerkship directors and directors of clinical electives will review duty hours data after each rotation to address any concerns and to adjust requirements as necessary. The Office of Medical Student Education will review the data quarterly to address any concerns and to adjust requirements as necessary. Quarterly data will be presented to the Committee on Oversight of Medical Student Education and its subcommittee, the Clinical Curriculum Committee, which will charge the appropriate individuals or offices with improvement plans, when necessary. The Duty Hour Policy was last approved by the Academic Affairs Committee on Nov. 5, 2019. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Academic Affairs Committee. MD: Grade Notification Policies and Procedures Background The Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) element 9.8 requires that all final grades be recorded and available to students within six weeks of the end of a course or clerkship. The Gateway Curriculum of Washington University School of Medicine is a competency-based curriculum in which students do not receive tiered grades. Summative decisions regarding competency are made at the level of each phase and, during Phase 2, each clerkship for patient care only. Decisions regarding course credit, which are based on the completion of the required elements of a course, are made at the completion of each course during Phase 1. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that no summative assessment or course credit decision is delayed beyond six weeks from the end of or final requirement due date for any course or clerkship, as mandated by our accrediting body. 364Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) Policies The Medical School Registrar is responsible for monitoring and reporting that all competency or credit decisions for courses, clerkships, and phases are submitted in the learning management system (LMS) within six weeks of the end of the course or clerkship or final requirement due date. The failure of course or clerkship directors to submit 100% of decisions within this time frame will result in corrective action(s) as appropriate. Guidelines Communication: The expectations for return of competency and credit decisions should be shared with course and clerkship directors at least annually. All course and clerkship directors should be encouraged to create a streamlined process for the completion and integration of student evaluations in order to meet grade submission deadlines. The Grade Notification Policies and Procedures for the Washington University School of Medicine MD Program were last approved by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Student Education (COMSE) on Jan. 10, 2022. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by COMSE. MD: Policy for Non-Involvement of Providers of Student Health Services in Student Assessment Background In keeping with Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) element 12.5, every medical student has the right to keep any and all health professionals who provide health services, including psychiatric/psychological counseling, from involvement in their academic assessment or promotion. Washington University School of Medicine is committed to ensuring that medical student health records are maintained in accordance with legal requirements for security, privacy, confidentiality, and accessibility. Policies/Requirement All providers of health and psychiatric/psychological services to a medical student will have no role in directly assessing that student nor have a direct role in decisions about the competence and promotion of that student, excluding exceptional circumstances. All student health services will ensure the security of confidential health information in accordance with legal requirements.The Washington University School of Medicine Policy for Non-Involvement of Providers of Student Health Services in Student Assessment was last approved by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Student Education (COMSE) on Jan. 10, 2022. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by COMSE. MD: Policy for Tuition Refund for the MD Program Background Pursuant to LCME element 12.2, Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) is to have clear policies for the refund of a medical student's tuition, fees, and other allowable payments. Policies A student who withdraws or takes a leave of absence from WUSM will receive a pro rata refund of tuition, other payments made for health benefits and disability insurance, and for other fees. For situations in which students elect to continue to receive student health benefits, they will not receive a refund for payments made for health benefits and disability insurance for the term in which they are enrolled. The refund will be based on the ratio of the number of weeks enrolled in the MD program (from the first day of classes to the termination date) to the total number of class weeks in the MD program in the term for which tuition and fees were paid. There is no point in the semester at which a student would have $0 refunded in tuition. It is understood that the date on which a student formally notifies the Registrar's Office in writing of the decision to withdraw or take a leave of absence from WUSM shall be regarded as the termination date, with no retroactive clause to be accepted. A prospective date will be accepted, however. If tuition and fees were paid entirely or in part by financial aid from WUSM, the refund will be applied first to the total repayment of the accounts from which financial aid was drawn, with any remaining refund balance given to the student. Financial aid received in excess of the costs of tuition and fees must be refunded by the student to WUSM on the same pro rata basis as calculated for the tuition refund outlined elsewhere, per \"Return of Title IV\" federal guidelines. Any questions about these policies may be directed to either the Registrar's Office or Student Financial Planning. Guidelines Any student who withdraws or takes a leave of absence must formally notify the Registrar's Office in writing. The Washington University School of Medicine Policy for Tuition Refund for the MD Program was last approved by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Student Education on July 11, 2022. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Student Education. 365Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) MD: Washington University School of Medicine Technical Standards for the Medical Program Washington University welcomes diverse applicants, including those with physical, sensory, learning, psychological, and chronic disease-related disabilities. The School of Medicine is committed to advocating for its students with disabilities and to educating a medical workforce that mirrors the diversity of the national population. We aim to be leaders in accessibility and inclusion. Individuals seeking to graduate from Washington University with a Doctor of Medicine degree are expected to gain broad competence in the skills that underlie the practice of medicine and surgery. With or without accommodations, they must have the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary to meet the School of Medicine's educational program objectives and meet the Technical Standards outlined in this document. All graduates must be able to take a patient's history, perform an examination, and synthesize the findings into an assessment and plan in a reliable and effective manner, with or without reasonable accommodations. The abilities needed to meet these standards include the following: 1.Observation Skills, including gaining information from instructional activities, taking a history, and recognizing and evaluating physical findings 2.Communication Skills, including effective verbal and non- verbal communication with patients, caregivers, the health care team, and the education community 3.Motor Function, including navigating the clinical environment and performing a physical examination 4.Intellectual-Conceptual, Integrative, and Quantitative Abilities, including acquiring, synthesizing and applying foundational knowledge and clinical data 5.Behavioral, Social and Professional Attributes, including functioning as a compassionate, respectful, effective, ethical member of the health care and education community; receiving and acting on feedback; possessing the emotional and mental health needed to provide patient care; and prioritizing patient care in the face of competing demands Applicants to the MD program review and attest to their ability to meet these technical standards as part of their application to the School of Medicine, and students attest again on an annual basis. We welcome students with disabilities to apply to our school, to disclose their disability, and to collaborate with us to develop accommodations so that they can thrive and do their best work. Individuals who anticipate needing accommodations are encouraged to contact the university's Disability Resourcesoffice (https://students.wustl.edu/disability-resources/) for a consultation. Disability Resources will engage in a confidential and interactive process with the student and other personnel as necessary to determine reasonable accommodations. As accommodations are not applied retroactively and may require time to be implemented, they should be requested in a timely manner. Decisions on admission, retention and graduation will not be affected by the need for accommodations. The Washington University School of Medicine Technical Standards for the Medical Program was last approved by the Executive Faculty on May 5, 2021. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Executive Faculty. MD: Transportation Policy for Medical Students on Clinical Assignments Background The primary goal of the medical program at Washington University School of Medicine is to provide the highest quality education possible to its students resulting in the development of competent and caring physicians. Among the core curricular activities necessary to accomplish this are intensive and meaningful patient care rotations. Though most clinical assignments will be located on the Barnes-Jewish Hospital/Washington University campus, some required clinical assignments are located off campus. In keeping with LCME standards 5.5 and 6.4, this is to ensure appropriate resources for clinical instruction in both ambulatory and inpatient settings with adequate numbers and types of patients. Policies A listing of clinical rotations requiring transportation will be available to students. This list will be updated annually by the Office of Medical Student Education (OMSE). All students are required to make themselves aware of these rotations well in advance so that they are familiar with travel requirements. Gas, mileage, parking fees, and ride or public transportation fares are not reimbursed by the school. In order to more equitably distribute both on and off campus assignments, a system for centrally monitoring students' travel for off-campus clinical assignments will be available to clinical course directors and will be overseen by the Clinical Curriculum Committee (CCC). When applicable, students will have the opportunity to submit their ranked choices for clinical assignments in advance. A record of student choice with subsequent alignment and nonalignment with clinical assignment will be included in this system. 366Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) Medical students will be required to travel to off-campus clinical rotations when these are assigned by the clinical rotation course director. In order to avoid inequitable distributions of these assignments, a student's stated lack of access to a private vehicle should not be considered in and of itself when creating these assignments. Students who do not have access to a private vehicle will consult the \"Guidelines\" section of this policy item for recommended options. If a student believes that they have been unfairly assigned, they should discuss it first with the clinical course director. If the issue is not resolved to satisfaction, they may approach the Assistant Dean for Curriculum and Clinical Sciences with their concerns. Guidelines Clinical course directors should consider a student's current choice for assignment in the context of the degree to which their prior choices aligned with prior assignments. Clinical course directors should work to accommodate students who indicate a preference for a particular off-campus assignment as opposed to one that is on site. Course directors should be aware of the significant amount of time incurred by students who are assigned off site in their commutes to and from campus when scheduling required learning activities on campus. When available, telecommunication strategies should be used as a way to mitigate this burden. Clinical courses that require a subset of enrolled students to travel to off-campus assignments are encouraged to consider changes in scheduling that compensate for the lost travel time. Students without direct access to a car are advised of the following options for travel. These may include carpooling, ride services (e.g., taxi, Uber, Lyft), public transportation, rental car service, or biking/walking. Mutually acceptable trades in clinical assignments between peers can be considered at the discretion of the clinical course director, although there are no guarantees that these can always be accommodated. The Washington University School of Medicine Transportation Policy for Medical Students on Clinical Assignments was last approved by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Student Education on April 6, 2020. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Student Education. Policies for Gateway Curriculum StudentsMD: Formative Asssessment and Feedback for Medical Students Policy Background Formative assessment and feedback are critical to high- quality medical education, and, as such, they are central to the educational mission of Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). In keeping with LCME Standard 9.7, WUSM is committed to ensuring that each medical student is assessed and provided with formal formative feedback early enough during each required course or clerkship to allow sufficient time for improvement. For the purposes of this policy, formative assessment is defined as any no/low stakes assessment performed during the learning experience for the purposes of providing formative feedback. Formative feedback is defined as information communicated to a medical student in a timely manner that is intended to modify the student's thinking or behavior to improve subsequent learning and performance in the medical curriculum. Policies All students must receive meaningful formal formative assessment of and feedback on their performance during each of the required courses and clerkships of all phases of the Gateway Curriculum at WUSM. At minimum, this feedback should occur at the midpoint of the course or clerkship, although formative assessment and feedback occurring before and after this point are also encouraged. Required courses or clerkships that are less than four weeks in length must provide an alternate means by which each student can measure their progress in learning at a point that still allows sufficient time for improvement. Directors of required courses and clerkships are responsible for documenting that each student has received formative assessment and feedback. The Committee for Oversight of Medical Education (COMSE) will conduct oversight of student responses on both internal and external surveys for all required modules and clerkships. In the event that a given module, course, or clerkship fails to demonstrate that each student has received formative assessment and feedback, additional inquiry will be conducted by the Associate Dean for Medical Student Education. In the event that a consistent pattern of noncompliance is identified, the COMSE will make specific recommendations for remediation. 367Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) Guidelines Quality feedback ought to include reinforcement of things done well, identification of room for improvement or omissions, and specific strategies for improvement. Evidence for this feedback in the form of specific examples and observations should also be included. The Washington University School of Medicine Formative Assessment and Feedback for Medical Students Policy was last approved by the Oversight Committee on Medical Education on Oct. 5, 2020. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Oversight Committee on Medical Education governing body. MD: Washington University School of Medicine Policy for Monitoring of Student Time Background Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) is committed to providing our students with an excellent education that is balanced with the need for learners to have sufficient time for self-directed learning and overall well-being. In keeping with Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) standard 8.8, WUSM is responsible for monitoring the amount of time medical students spend in required learning activities in the Gateway Curriculum. This monitoring includes the total number of hours medical students are required to spend in clinical and educational activities during clerkships, the latter being accounted for in WUSM's Duty Hour Policy for Medical Students on Clerkships and Other Clinical Rotations (p. 363). For the purposes of this policy, required learning activities include clinical duty hours, all scheduled didactic activities, required preparatory work for didactic activities, scheduled clinical skills exercises, required community engagement, required coaching sessions, and summative assessments during Phase 1 of the Gateway Curriculum. Policies Please see WUSM's Duty Hour Policy for Medical Students on Clerkships and Other Clinical Rotations (p. 363 ) for policies and guidelines regarding the monitoring of student time on clinical courses within the legacy curriculum of WUSM. All students will be excused from required learning activities during all official Washington University holidays. All students will also be excused to access health services as described in WUSM's Medical Student Access to Healthcare Services Policy (p. 362). Time spent on all required learning activities will be accounted for in the learning management system of WUSM.All students spend no more than 35 hours per week on all required learning activities, including required preparatory work for said learning activities, while enrolled in any of the nonclinical courses of Phase 1 of the Gateway Curriculum. Students are to spend no more than 50 hours per week on all required learning activities during their enrollment in the Clinical Immersions of Phase 1, inclusive of clinical experiences, course- specific classroom-based activities, coaching and online work. Student workload during required courses of the Gateway Curriculum will be monitored by the Office of Medical Student Education (OMSE) for each Phase 1 course through canvasing of the learning management system and through internal and external surveys of students. In the event that there are concerns regarding the adherence of a course to the WUSM Policy for Monitoring Student Time, data substantiating said concerns will be presented by OMSE to the appropriate course lead. If not corrected, information will be sent forth to the appropriate governance structure for evaluation, monitoring and change management. The Committee on Oversight of Medical Student Education and any relevant subcommittees will charge the appropriate individuals or offices with improvement plans as indicated. Guidelines The above restrictions on student workload represent the upper limits of time that students can spend on required learning activities. Course directors are also welcome to utilize less time per week, as appropriate. All course directors are encouraged to proactively communicate to students the expectations for required preparatory time for all learning activities (including immersions). These expectations can be informed through the use of course workload estimators. To ensure that the time devoted to scheduled instructional activities is accurately reflected in course plans, course directors are encouraged to use best practices, applicable Academy of Educator workshops, and/or consultation with the Instructional Design Studio. Course directors are strongly encouraged to be considerate of the periodic need for breaks during scheduled required learning activities. The Washington University School of Medicine Policy for Monitoring Student Time was last approved by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Student Education governing body on Jan. 4, 2021. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Student Education governing body . 368Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) MD: Washington University School of Medicine Narrative Assessment Policy Background Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) is committed to providing the highest quality medical education to our students who are preparing to lead the future of health and medicine. Narrative assessment provides students with the critical guidance needed to improve performance. Acknowledging the importance of narrative assessment, the LCME element 9.5 requires that students receive narrative feedback on competency development, including non-cognitive achievement. The purpose of narrative assessment is to ensure that students are provided feedback on their development and progress, with sufficient time to receive support in bringing their performance onto a better trajectory, when necessary. Policies Narrative assessment is a required component of the assessment of each student in the Gateway Curriculum at WUSM across all competency domains. Narrative assessments of a medical student's performance will be provided when all of the following curricular conditions are met: Students work in small groups of less than or equal to 12 members. Small groups of the same composition are observed longitudinally by the same faculty member for at least three sessions, with a ratio of one faculty member to one student team. Narrative assessment can be provided in courses that do not meet these criteria, provided there is documentation that the nature of the interaction allows for meaningful feedback regarding the indicated competencies. The Washington University School of Medicine Narrative Assessment Policy was last approved by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Education governing body on Oct. 4, 2021. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Education governing body. MD: Phase 1 Attendance Policy Background The profession of medicine requires the utmost commitment of time and energy to learning/education, patient care, research and other scholarly activities. The development of this commitment begins in Phase 1 of the Gateway Curriculum.Students must recognize that teaching, learning and assessment in both clinical and nonclinical settings are dependent on the student's presence and participation in their education. Time spent away from an educational experience may decrease learning and impede effective assessment. In keeping with LCME standard 12.4, all students requiring access to necessary diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic care for both acute and chronic health concerns are to be excused from required learning activities. Please refer to the Access to Healthcare Services Policy (p. 362) for additional details. Policies/Requirement Students are expected to attend all required sessions within Phase 1 of the Gateway Curriculum as specified within the learning management system. In the unusual circumstance that a student finds that they are unable to attend a required session, the student must complete an absence notification form in the learning management system that will be sent to the faculty lead, with a copy sent to the Office of Medical Student Education (OMSE). This form must be completed prior to the session that they will miss or as soon as possible after the session if missed due to sudden illness or emergency. In addition, students unable to attend a team activity should notify their team members by email. In the case of immersions, students must also notify by email the clinical team to which they have been assigned. In the event that an absence is unavoidable, students will work with the faculty leads to develop a remediation plan for the missed session. All required assignments associated with a missed session must be completed. Faculty directors may require additional makeup work for missed sessions. Faculty leads may also designate some sessions as those that cannot be missed except under extreme circumstances because they cannot be made up. These sessions will be noted in the learning management system and should only be missed under extreme, unavoidable circumstances such as a medical illness or family emergency. Failure to attend a required learning activity without providing notification is considered an unprofessional behavior. Attendance data will be tracked longitudinally by OMSE within the learning management system for all phases of the curriculum. An absence will be recorded even when makeup work for a missed session is completed. Data will be monitored by the Director of Assessment in collaboration with OMSE and will be reviewed by the Competency Attainment Committee as evidence contributing to attainment of competency in PROF-2: Exhibit high standards of professional integrity. Guidelines Central monitoring of absences will reside with the Office of Medical Student Education and the Director of Assessment. A concerning trend of absences may be discussed with the Associate Dean of Student Affairs and the Director of Coaching 369Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) and Student Success to ensure appropriate student support can be offered and provided. Faculty directors of required Phase 1 sessions will include a specific faculty contact in the learning management system associated with all required sessions. The Washington University School of Medicine Phase 1 Attendance Policy was last approved by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Student Education governing body on Feb. 19, 2021. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Student Education governing body . MD: Phase 2 Attendance Policy Background The profession of medicine requires the utmost commitment of time and energy to learning/education, patient care, research, and, when appropriate, other scholarly activities. The development of this commitment begins in Phase 1 of the Gateway Curriculum and extends into Phase 2 as students advance in their training to become physicians. Students must recognize that teaching, learning, and assessment in both clinical and nonclinical settings are dependent on the student's presence and active participation. Time spent away from educational experiences, in both clinical and nonclinical settings, may decrease learning and impede effective assessment. The clerkships of Phase 2 of the Gateway Curriculum consist of a foundational week(s) period, a period of clinical assignments divided into individual rotations based on the specific clerkship, and a week of assessment, reflection, coaching, and communities (ARCC). This document outlines the attendance policies and expectations for Phase 2 of the Gateway Curriculum while also recognizing that students may have legitimate reasons for absences. In keeping with LCME element 12.4, all students requiring access to necessary diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic care for both acute and chronic health concerns are to be excused from required learning activities. Please refer to the Access to Healthcare Services Policy (p. 362) for additional details. Policies/Requirement Students are expected to attend all required sessions within Phase 2 of the Gateway Curriculum as specified within the learning management system. Required sessions will be noted in the learning management system and should only be missed under extreme, unavoidable circumstances such as a medical illness or family emergency. In the unusual circumstance in which a student finds that they are unable to attend a required session, the student must complete an absence notification form in the learning management system that will be sent to the faculty lead, with a copy sent to the Office of Medical Student Education (OMSE).This form must be completed prior to the session that the student will miss or as soon as possible after the session if it is missed due to sudden illness or emergency. Students unable to attend a team activity should notify their team members by email with as much advanced notice as can reasonably be expected under the circumstances. This obligation also applies to correspondence with clinical teams for absences that occur during the clinical portion of the clerkship. If the unavoidable absence occurs during the ARCC week and an assessment will be missed, the student must also complete the Request to Delay Assignment/ Assessment form. When students encounter an unavoidable absence for required events within the foundational week(s) of a clerkship or the ARCC week, those students will work with the clerkship directors and/or other stakeholders to develop a remediation plan for the missed session, when possible. All required assignments associated with a missed session must be completed, and clerkship directors may require additional makeup work for missed sessions. In keeping with the principles outlined above, students are expected to fully participate in their patient care assignments. If students find that they need to be absent from their responsibilities while rotating on clinical services, they will need to submit an absence notification form with as much advanced notice as can be reasonably expected under the circumstances. Students will still be accountable for meeting all clerkship requirements. Any absences that compromise a student's ability to meet these requirements and/or other Phase 2 requirements will require a remediation plan at the discretion of the clerkship director. Attendance data will be tracked longitudinally by the OMSE within the learning management system for all phases of the curriculum. An absence will be recorded even when makeup work for a missed session is completed. Data will be monitored by the Assistant Dean for Assessment (ADA) in collaboration with the OMSE, and it will be reviewed by the Competency Attainment Committee as evidence contributing to the attainment of competency in PROF-2: Exhibit high standards of professional integrity. Guidelines Students are encouraged to make up missed work on rotations when this can result in meaningful learning; they should discuss this option with the clinical course director. Students are encouraged to notify clerkship leadership teams about any planned absences so that clinical assignments can be developed to minimize the educational impact of such absences. 370Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) Clerkships will also observe a general limit of three days of absences during a student's clinical assignment. If a student has more than three days of absences during their clinical assignment, the consequences rendered will be at the discretion of the clerkship director, the Associate Dean of Student Affairs (ADSA), the ADA, and the Associate Dean for Medical Student Education. Central monitoring of absences will reside with the OMSE and the ADA. A concerning trend of absences may be discussed with the ADSA and the Director of Coaching and Student Success to ensure appropriate student support can be offered and provided. Faculty directors of required Phase 2 sessions will include a specific faculty contact in the learning management system associated with all required sessions. MSTP students are encouraged to do the following: Meet with the Assistant Dean for Career Development early for assistance in residency planning. Consider returning to the MD program to allow for maximum flexibility for interviewing and USMLE exams. Discuss planned absences with clerkship directors early and prior to clinical assignment development to better allow placement on a team to optimize the educational experience. We believe this guideline strikes an appropriate balance between increasing flexibility for the MSTP students and ensuring a meaningful educational experience on the core clinical rotations. The Washington University School of Medicine Phase 2 Attendance Policy was approved by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Student Education on Dec. 6, 2021. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Student Education. MD: Policy for the Preparation of Non-Faculty Instructors for the WUSM MD Program Background Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) is proud to provide students with extensive training opportunities offered by a diverse community of educators. At the same time, we recognize that this privilege comes with the responsibility to ensure rigor and fairness throughout our students' curricular experiences. The Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) element 9.1 requires that all residents, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and other non-faculty instructors in the medical education program who supervise or teach medical students be familiar with the learning objectives of the course or clerkship and that they are prepared for their roles in teaching and assessment. In keeping with this, WUSMis committed to ensuring that all parties who are assigned to supervise and/or assess medical students participate in orientation or other faculty development programs related to teaching and/or assessment. Policies All residents and other non-faculty instructors who are assigned to supervise and/or assess medical students are required to participate in orientation or other faculty development programs related to teaching and/or assessment. All residents and other non-faculty instructors will receive relevant course/clerkship objectives and other requirements. They will also review and abide by key policies related to the teaching, supervision, and assessment of medical students. Guidelines Instructors are referred to WUSM's Office of Education Teaching Resources for a listing of offices and facilities that provide teaching and classroom support. The Policy for the Preparation of Non-Faculty Instructors for the Washington University School of Medicine MD Program was last approved by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Student Education on July 11, 2022. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Student Education. MD: Procedure to Request an Alternate Educational Site or Clinical Assignment In compliance with LCME Standard 10.9, students may formally request an alternate educational site or clinical assignment. Such requests must be made in writing (email) to the Registrar's Office within two weeks of the release of the clinical assignment. Team assignments within individual clinical rotations or specific site concerns should be discussed with the appropriate Clerkship, ACR, Elective or Immersion Director. Students are also encouraged to contact Student Affairs at any time to help navigate unique circumstances or hardships. When necessary and appropriate, an alternate site will be assigned. MD: Washington University School of Medicine Policy for Review of Student Attainment of Competency Background In collaboration with the Office of Medical Student Education, the Office of Medical Student Affairs, and the Office of the Registrar and charged by the Committee for Academic Promotion, the Competency Attainment Committee (CAC) and the Clerkship 371Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) Competency Committees (CCCs) at Washington University School of Medicine regularly review and render decisions of competency attainment and recommendations about the academic progress of all medical students in the Gateway Curriculum. This policy is in line with LCME element 9.9: Student Advancement and Appeals Process. Policy Students for whom this policy applies include students enrolled in any phase of the Gateway Curriculum and students enrolled in dual and joint degree programs currently participating in the Gateway Curriculum. In order to successfully complete their studies at the Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM), students must demonstrate the ability to become a safe and effective physician by demonstrating competence in the WUSM Medical Student Program Objectives (p. 103). Attainment of competence in these educational program objectives is determined by the CAC in partnership with the individual CCCs in Phase 2 of the curriculum based on the totality and sufficiency of evidence regarding a student's performance. Competency decisions of not competent, competent, and competent with distinction (where applicable) and the subsequent promotion recommendations are presented to the Committee for Academic Promotion, which is the committee charged with ratifying final competency decisions and promotion recommendations. Promotion recommendations include one of the following for each student: 1.Promotion, with or without ongoing remediation 2.Remediation without promotion 3.Dismissal or other sanctions, including but not limited to probation or suspension, which may occur throughout the enrollment of a student 4.Qualification to receive the Doctor of Medicine degree Students considering an appeal of any of the above decisions and/or recommendations are referred to the WUSM Policy for Student Promotion and Appeals (p. 376) and the Formal Appeal Procedures for Competency Attainment and Promotion Decisions (p. 377). Situations may exist in which a committee member has a conflict of interest such that the committee member is unable to perform their duties to objectively render a decision about a particular student. In such a case, the committee member must recuse themselves from participation in deliberations and decisions regarding that student. Please see the conflict of interest policy for full details. The responsibility for maintaining and overseeing this policy resides with the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Student Education.The Washington University School of Medicine Policy for Review of Student Attainment of Competency was last approved by the Academic Affairs Committee on May 12, 2022. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Academic Affairs Committee. MD: Committee for Academic Promotion Bylaws 1. Charge In order to successfully complete their studies at the Washington University School of Medicine, students must demonstrate the ability to become a safe and effective physician by the attainment of competency in the WUSM Medical Student Program Objectives which are organized into six domains: I.Foundational knowledge for practice II.Patient care III.Systems-based practice IV.Practice-based learning and improvement V.Interpersonal and communication skills VI.Professionalism The Committee for Academic Promotion is charged by Academic Affairs Committee and has the responsibility to ratify decisions of competence (not yet competent, competent, competent with distinction where applicable) made by the Competency Attainment Committee (CAC), the Clerkship Competency Committees (CCCs), and the associated recommendations for academic promotion (promotion, delay, suspension, dismissal). This document describes the bylaws and procedures of the Committee for Academic Promotion (CAP). 2. Responsibilities Review of the recommendations made by the competency committees occur at times of adverse student actions (i.e., remediation without promotion or dismissal), at the time of promotion to each phase of the curriculum, and at graduation. Students will be notified at least 10 days prior to such reviews. When an adverse student outcome is recommended (remediation without promotion, suspension, or dismissal) or when decisions of competence without distinction are made, students may present themselves, in person and/or in writing, to the CAP to state their case. The CAP reviews any details that the student provides in addition to minutes of the CAC or CCC deliberations and any additional evidence as needed leading to the recommendation. Based on this review, the CAP would take one of the following courses of action: 372Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) Ratify and uphold the CAC and/or CCC decisions and recommendations Remand back to the original committee for re-review Overturn the decision of the original committee if the CAP perceives an inability for the original committee to make an unbiased recommendation 3. Membership 3.1 There will be a minimum of five voting members of the CAP representing leadership of the Gateway Curriculum plus a faculty member who represents the broader WUSM educational community. Each member will serve a three- year term with the possibility for two one-year extensions. If a voting member is temporarily unable to serve in this role during their term, the Dean or the Dean's designee may appoint a faculty member to the CAP to fulfill that member's responsibilities as needed. 3.2 In addition, CAP membership will include non-voting, ex officio members based on their broad understanding of the competency-based program of assessment and their role in student advocacy and support. These members will include the Associate Dean of Student Affairs, the Director of Student Success, the Assistant Dean for Assessment, the Associate Dean for Medical Student Education, the Associate Dean for Admissions, and the Director of Student Health Services. 3.3 Chair: The chair of the CAP will be a voting member selected by other voting members. The chair will serve a two-year term and may be reappointed for up to two additional terms. 3.4 Guests: Any faculty, administrator, student, or staff member may be invited as a guest, at the discretion of the chair, if their presence is deemed important for providing additional evidence in support of decisions of competency attainment. Guests would be present to provide said evidence and/or answer questions but would not be present during nor participate in deliberations or voting. 4. Meeting Frequency and Quorum 4.1 CAP meetings occur at transitions in the curriculum (end of Phase 1, end of Phase 2, graduation) or on an ad hoc basis when adverse student outcomes are recommended by the CAC or CCC. 4.2 A quorum will constitute attendance, virtual or in person, of four of the five voting members, excluding those with conflicts of interest.* 4.3 Decisions of the CAP must be supported by four of the five voting members, excluding those with conflicts of interest.*4.4 In the rare situation where a quorum cannot be met because too many members have a conflict of interest,* an ad hoc committee will be convened by the Assistant Dean for Assessment. *The policy on conflicts of interest provides specific details. 5. Deliberations and Outcomes CAP deliberations and outcomes will be summarized in the meeting minutes. Students will be notified in writing by the Registrar of all decisions, generally within 7 calendar days of the review. CAP outcomes include one of the following: Ratify and uphold the CAC and/or CCC decisions and recommendations Remand back to the original committee for re-review Overturn the decision of the original committee if the CAP perceives an inability for the original committee to make an unbiased recommendation 6. Notification of CAP Decisions Decisions regarding remediation that would result in delays in education or individualized or modified schedules will also be communicated to the Associate Dean for Medical Student Education to ensure feasibility for re-entry and successful completion. Decisions regarding dismissal will be reported to the Senior Associate Dean of Education. Decisions of remediation without progression, dismissal, probation, or suspension will also be communicated to Financial Aid to support necessary alterations in aid. 7. Student Engagement With the CAP Students may present themselves, in person or in writing, prior to the ratification of decisions of competency without distinction as an appeal of that decision. Students may also present themselves, in person or in writing, prior to the ratification of recommendations for adverse outcomes to state their case. This does not serve as a formal appeal, as appeals would only be made in the setting of CAP ratification and, as such a decision is made, for an adverse outcome. Further details for these procedures can be found in the Formal Appeal Procedures for Competency Attainment and Promotion Decisions (p. 377). 373Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) MD: Competency Attainment and Clerkship Competency Committees' Bylaws 1. Charge In order to successfully complete their studies at the Washington University School of Medicine, students must demonstrate the ability to become a safe and effective physician by the attainment of competency in the WUSM Medical Student Program Objectives, which are as follows: I.Foundational knowledge for practice II.Patient care III.Systems-based practice IV.Practice-based learning and improvement V.Interpersonal and communication skills VI.Professionalism As subcommittees of the Committee for Academic Promotion (CAP), the Competency Attainment Committee (CAC) and the Clerkship Competency Committees (CCCs) have the tasks of evaluating progress toward and attainment of competency and of making recommendations for promotion and remediation. This document describes the bylaws and procedures of these committees. 2. Responsibilities Review of the evidence supporting progression toward and attainment of competence of students in the Gateway Curriculum will be made by the CAC in conjunction, in Phase 2, with the CCCs. The committees review evidence provided through multiple student assessments. Student progression toward successful competency attainment is reviewed by the committees at multiple times within each phase of the Gateway Curriculum to allow for early identification of students not on trajectory to meet competency attainment, thereby providing early support for successful competency attainment and timely release of financial aid ( Standards for Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid Eligibility ( p. 402)). Based on the totality and sufficiency of evidence regarding a student's performance in each of the WUSM Medical Student Program Objectives, the committees determine if the evidence supports that a student has attained competency. The deliberations of the CAC and the CCCs are generally positive in approach and committed to the ultimate aim of assisting students in the successful completion of the courses of study. The CAC and the CCCs have several important roles, including \u2014 but not limited to \u2014 the following:2.1. Review of all assessment data, via individual student competency portfolios and compiled assessment summaries, to determine if a student has, or is on a trajectory to, attain competence. 2.2. Evaluation of competency attainment based on the review of the totality of a student's assessment data to support competency decisions of not competent, competent, or competent with distinction (where applicable). 2.3. Make recommendations regarding a student's academic progress to the CAP based on competency decisions, including the following: 2.3.a. Promotion to the next phase of training. 2.3.b. Remediation, with or without promotion. When a student has not demonstrated competency or is on trajectory toward failure to attain competence in any Educational Program Objective, the committees will recommend that student for academic support. In some instances, a student's trajectory can be addressed through informal means such as discussion with their coach, alternative educational methods that can be accomplished prior to transition, or additional educational or social supports. Failure to improve to the extent that they are on trajectory to meet competence in time for transition to the next phase will require formal remediation and a delay in transition to the next phase. Formal remediation recommendations will be submitted, along with the student's assessment evidence and committee deliberations, to the Student Success Team for review and for the development of a formal remediation plan. The CAC will make recommendations to the CAP regarding when details of a formal remediation should be included within the Medical Student Performance Evaluation. 2.3.c. Dismissal or other sanctions, including but not limited to probation or suspension. When warranted, such as in situations including but not limited to the persistence of dyscompetence despite remediation or marked critical deficiency, the committees may recommend a student warrants dismissal, suspension, probation, or other sanctions. While the committees encourage the use of progressive actions and opportunities for remediation, the nature or severity of the dyscompetence may prompt, at their discretion, more immediate or severe actions. 2.3.d. For the CAC only, qualification to receive the Doctor of Medicine degree for those students who have successfully completed all prescribed requirements of the School of Medicine. 374Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) 2.4. Review of any remediation processes to determine if competency has been attained following remediation efforts. 2.5. For the CAC only, approval of any leave of absence greater than one year, not inclusive of those students enrolled in a dual degree program, owing to the impact on competency attainment as competence is a longitudinal process. 2.6. For the CAC only, recommendations to the CAP and Executive Faculty those students who have successfully completed all prescribed requirements of the School of Medicine and who are qualified to receive the Doctor of Medicine degree. In circumstances wherein the committees recommend an adverse outcome (remediation without promotion, suspension, or dismissal) or competency without distinction (where applicable), students will be notified of this recommendation to allow for an opportunity to present themselves to the CAP, as another source of information alongside review of the original committee's minutes and recommendations, prior to ratification and/or final decisions by the CAP. Further details of these processes can be found in the Formal Appeal Procedures for Competency Attainment and Promotion Decisions (p. 377). Competency Attainment Committee Specific Details 1. Membership 1.1. There will be a minimum of eight voting members of the CAC representing leadership from each phase of the Gateway Curriculum plus a faculty member from the broader faculty community representing any area of study or training in which students participate. Each member will serve a three-year term with the possibility for two one-year extensions. 1.2. Chair: The chair of the CAC will be a voting member selected by other voting members. The chair will serve a two-year term and may be reappointed for up to two additional terms. During the initial implementation of the CAC, the Assistant Dean for Assessment will serve as chair. 1.3. Guests: Any faculty, administrator, student, or staff member may be invited as a guest, at the discretion of the chair, if their presence is deemed important for providing additional evidence in support of decisions of competency attainment. Guests would be present to provide said evidence and/or answer questions but would not be present during nor participate in deliberations or voting.2. Meeting Frequency and Quorum 2.1. CAC meetings occur throughout each phase of the Gateway Curriculum with sufficient frequency to do the following: 2.1.a. Allow for the review of assessment data to determine if a student is on trajectory to achieve competence in each Educational Program Objectives. 2.1.b. Allow reasonable opportunities for early support and remediation to be completed, if required. 2.1.c. Make recommendations near the completion of each phase regarding promotion, remediation with or without promotion, suspension, or dismissal with sufficient time to for students to present themselves to the CAP. 2.2. CAC meetings may be called ad hoc when significant concerns regarding competence occur. 2.3. A quorum will constitute attendance, virtual or in person, of three of the four voting members, excluding those who face a conflict of interest.* 2.4. Decisions of the CAC must be supported by three of the four voting members, excluding those with conflicts of interest.* 2.5. In the rare situation in which a quorum cannot be met because too many members have conflicts of interest,* an ad hoc committee will be convened by the Assistant Dean for Assessment. *The policy on conflicts of interest provides specific details. 3. Deliberations and Outcomes CAC deliberations, decisions, and associated recommendations will be summarized in the meeting minutes. All deliberations will be presented to the CAP. Students will be notified, in writing, by the Registrar of all recommendations and no less than 10 days prior to CAP review. Students wishing to present themselves to the CAP must follow the appropriate process as outlined in the Formal Appeal Procedures for Competency Attainment and Promotion Decisions (p. 377). Recommendations regarding remediation that would result in delays in education or individualized or modified schedules will also be communicated to the Associate Dean for Medical Student Education to ensure feasibility for re-entry and successful completion. Recommendations regarding dismissal will be reported to the Senior Associate Dean of Education. Recommendations by the CAC of remediation without progression, dismissal, probation, or suspension will also be communicated to Financial Aid to support necessary alterations in aid. 375Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) Clerkship Competency Committee Specific Details 1. Membership and Quorum Members of the CCC must be at the Instructor faculty level or higher. The Clerkship Director serves as a non-voting chair of the CCC. Any CCC member who had a longitudinal supervisory role for a student may participate in deliberations but not voting for that student. Deliberation and voting require at least three voting members to be in attendance. Any faculty, administrator, student, or staff member may be invited as a guest, at the discretion of the chair, if their presence is deemed important for providing additional evidence in support of decisions of competency attainment. Guests would be present to provide said evidence and/or answer questions but would not be present during nor participate in deliberations or voting. 2. Meeting Frequency CCC meetings occur at the conclusion of each clerkship block with sufficient time to meet the LCME requirement of grade return, which is defined as both the completion of the End-of- Clerkship narrative (which is what notifies the students, via the electronic learning management system, of their competency outcomes) and the return of competency outcomes to the Registrar for posting in the transcript. 3. Deliberations and Outcomes CCC deliberations, decisions, and associated recommendations will be summarized in the meeting minutes. All deliberations will be presented to the CAP. Recommendations regarding remediation that would result in delays in education or individualized or modified schedules will also be communicated to the Associate Dean for Medical Student Education to ensure feasibility for re-entry and successful completion. Recommendations regarding dismissal will be reported to the Senior Associate Dean of Education. MD: Washington University School of Medicine Policy for Student Promotion and Appeals Background In collaboration with the Office of Medical Student Education, the Office of Student Affairs, and the Office of the Registrar and charged by the Academic Affairs Committee, the Committee for Academic Promotion (CAP) reviews the recommendations of the Competency Attainment Committee (CAC) and the ClerkshipCompetency Committees (CCCs) and renders final decisions regarding student advancement and graduation. This policy is in line with LCME element 9.9: Student Advancement and Appeals Process. Policy Students for whom this policy applies include students enrolled in any phase of the Gateway Curriculum and students enrolled in dual and joint degree programs currently participating in the Gateway Curriculum. The CAP is charged with the ratification of all competency decisions and promotion recommendations, which include the following: 1.Not competent/competent/competent with distinction (where applicable) 2.Promotion, with or without ongoing remediation 3.Remediation without promotion 4.Dismissal or other sanctions, including but not limited to probation or suspension, which may occur throughout the enrollment of a student 5.Recommendation to Executive Faculty those students who have successfully completed all prescribed requirements of the school and are qualified to receive the Doctor of Medicine degree Students will be notified of competency decisions and promotion recommendations 10 days prior to the CAP meeting in which those recommendations will be discussed. Students may present themselves at the CAP, in person or in writing, to be heard on any of the following: Decisions of competency without distinction Recommendation for an adverse outcome (remediation without promotion, sanctions, or dismissal) In the case of decisions of competency without distinction, student presentation before the CAP constitutes a formal appeal of that decision. In the case of recommendations for adverse outcomes, any student presentation prior to CAP ratification is not considered a formal appeal. Further details for student presentation and appeal procedures can be found in the Formal Appeal Procedures for Competency Attainment and Promotion Decisions (p. 377). Following the review and consideration of the CCC's evidence and the student's information, when provided, the CAP will take one of the following actions: Ratify and uphold the competency decision and promotion recommendation Remand back to the CCC for further review Overturn the decision of the CCC if the CAP perceives an inability for the original committee to make an unbiased recommendation 376Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) Students may formally appeal decisions of the CAP that impact their ability to progress through the standard curriculum (remediation without promotion, suspension, or dismissal). Appeals must be filed within seven days. The scope of all appeals shall be limited to (i) bias and/or failure to follow the standard processes used for reviewing evidence and competency determination that materially affected the outcome; and/or (ii) new information or evidence exists that was not reasonably available at the time of the decision and that could affect the outcome of the decision. Decisions that would result in delays in education or individualized or modified schedules will be communicated to the Associate Dean for Medical Student Education to ensure feasibility for re-entry and timing for successful completion of the degree requirements. Decisions regarding dismissal will be reported to the Senior Associate Dean of Education. Decisions of remediation without progression, dismissal, probation, or suspension will also be communicated to Financial Aid to support necessary alterations in aid. All decisions will be recorded by the Registrar, including decisions as to whether information will be included within the formal academic record. The responsibility for maintaining and overseeing this policy lies with the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Student Education. The Washington University School of Medicine Policy for Student Promotion and Appeals was last approved by the Academic Affairs Committee on May 12, 2022. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Academic Affairs Committee. MD: Contesting Individual Assessments Procedure Students wishing to dispute a specific assessment, not a competency decision, do so using the Qualtrics (https:// wustl.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3HImgMLSHZ4XQV0/ )XM form within seven calendar days of formal notification of the assessment outcomes being posted to the electronic learning management system (Keystone). The form will require the student to complete the following details: Assessment being disputed Reason for or description of dispute Dispute forms will be sent to the Assistant Dean for Assessment, the OMSE, and the appropriate party (see list below) who has final authority to make determinations on changes at the individual assessment or assessment item level. The appropriate parties with whom dispute forms will be shared are as follows:1.Observed Structured Clinical Examination disputes are directed to the Clinical Skills and Communication Thread Leaders. 2.Individual foundational knowledge for practice assessment disputes are directed to the specific course/module leadership. 3.Individual patient care assessment disputes are directed to the appropriate course (Immersions or clerkship) leadership. 4.Disputes for all other individual phase assessments are directed to the Chair of the Competency Attainment Committee. Students will be notified of the final outcome of the dispute within 14 calendar days of assessment outcome posting in the electronic learning management system. Additional Guidelines Students are advised that feedback from any one individual frontline assessor does not guarantee a specific competency outcome. Frontline assessors are not in a position to render such decisions. Students are advised not to engage directly with individual assessors or instructors when concerns about an assessment arise. Instead, they should discuss the issue with the appropriate party as identified above in this document. The perceived absence of formative or constructive feedback does not guarantee a specific outcome. Receiving insufficient feedback cannot be the sole basis for an appeal. If a student feels that they are not receiving sufficient feedback, even after asking for it, they are encouraged to discuss this with the appropriate course director before the end of the curricular period. Mid-clerkship feedback is not a guarantee of any specific final outcome. Clinical performance assessments returned more than 21 calendar days after the conclusion of a clerkship will not be considered credible sources of assessment information/ evidence. Students wishing to file a formal appeal should refer to the Formal Appeal Procedures for Competency Attainment and Promotion Decisions (p. 377). MD: Formal Appeal Procedures for Competency Attainment and Promotion Decisions This procedure applies to all medical doctorate students at Washington University School of Medicine enrolled in the Gateway Curriculum. 377Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) The School of Medicine recognizes that the primary responsibility for academic evaluation with respect to student competency attainment resides within the Competency Attainment Committee (CAC) in partnership with the Clerkship Competency Committees (CCCs). Final decisions regarding promotion resides with Committee for Academic Promotion (CAP). Procedures of Competency Attainment and Subsequent Decisions The interests of competency attainment are best resolved with early identification and support. Thus, concerns regarding student trajectory that may not support competency attainment should be recognized early and referred to the Student Success Team by the appropriate and responsible parties including but not limited to the Assistant Dean for Assessment, a coach, the Associate Dean for Student Affairs (ADSA), the CAC, the CCCs, or the course or clerkship lead. For further details of the policies surrounding student promotion and review of competency attainment, please refer to the Policies & Guidelines of the School of Medicine (p. 351) in this Bulletin. Decisions and Recommendations for Which Students May Appeal CAP decisions to ratify recommendations of adverse promotion outcomes which include remediation without promotion, suspension, or dismissal Decisions of competence without distinction (where distinction is available) The appeal shall be limited to determining whether (i) bias and/or failure to follow the standard processes of competency determination occurred or (ii) new information or evidence exists that was not reasonably available at the time of the decision and that could affect the outcome of their decision. Students are encouraged to present themselves, in person or writing, to the Chair of the CAC and/or the Clerkship Director, as appropriate, when questions or concerns around decisions and recommendations surface to gain clarity. Students may also present themselves, in person or in writing, to the CAP prior to their final ratification. All of these steps occur prior to a formal appeal.Process for Students Wishing to File Appeals for Decisions of Competence Without Distinction When the CAP receives a decision for competence without distinction, students may file a formal appeal of that decision if they feel that bias and/or failure to follow the standard processes occurred or new information or evidence exists that was not available at the time of the decision and that affected the outcome or decision. The procedure for appeals in these circumstances is as follows: Students complete the Qualtrics (https:// wustl.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_71KNQ2o9LB6J7ee/ )XM form within seven calendar days of notification of the decision of competence without distinction. The form, which will be sent to the Registrar, the ADSA, and Chair of the CAP, with a copy to the student, will require the student to complete the following details: Decision being appealed Reason for appeal (i.e., bias and/or failure to follow the standard processes of competency determination or new information or evidence exists that was not reasonably available at the time of the decision and that could affect the outcome) The ADSA or their representative will contact the student to support the full development of the appeal, which will provide a detailed description of the basis for the appeal and pertinent documentation to support the basis for the appeal, including, in the situation of new information not available at the time, an explanation as to why that information was not available, when possible. Completed appeal documentation must be received by the Chair of the CAP within 14 calendar days of the original notification of a decision for competency without distinction. The ADSA shall provide the request and documentation (student documentation and all meeting minutes and written recommendations/decisions) to the CAP for review. The student may present themselves to the CAP, in person or in writing, prior to CAP ratification. Following review, the CAP may make any of the following recommendations: 1) ratify and uphold the decision; 2) remand back to the original committee for re-review; or 3) overturn the decision if the committee perceives an inability for the original committee to make an unbiased recommendation. This is the final level of appeal for a decision of competence without distinction. 378Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) Process for Students Wishing to File Appeals for Decisions of Adverse Outcomes Given the significant nature of decisions of adverse outcomes, when the CAP ratifies such recommendations, students may file a formal appeal of that decision if they feel that bias and/or failure to follow the standard processes or new information or evidence exists that was not available at the time of the decision that would have affected the outcome or decision. The procedure for appeals in these circumstances is as follows: Students complete the Qualtrics (https:// wustl.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_71KNQ2o9LB6J7ee/ )XM form within seven calendar days of notification of the CAP decision. The form, which will be sent to the Registrar, the ADSA, and the Chair of the CAP, with a copy to the student, will require the student to complete the following details: Decision being appealed Reason for appeal (i.e., bias and/or failure to follow the standard processes of competency determination or new information or evidence exists that was not reasonably available at the time of the decision and that could affect the outcome) The ADSA or their representative will contact the student to support the full development of the appeal, which will provide a detailed description of the basis for the request and pertinent documentation to support the basis for the appeal, including, in the situation of new information not available at the time, an explanation as to why that information was not available, when possible. Completed appeal documentation must be received by the Chair of the Appeal Committee within 14 calendar days of the original CAP decision. The ADSA will convene an ad hoc three-member Appeal Committee. Members involved in the original CAC, CCC, or CAP decisions shall not be involved in the appeals process. Appeal Committee members should have familiarity with the curricular and/or assessment processes of the Gateway Curriculum. The ADSA shall provide the request and documentation (i.e., student documentation and CAC, CCC, and/or CAP meeting minutes and written recommendations/decisions) to the Appeal Committee for review. The student will be allowed to present themselves before the ad hoc committee. The committee may request additional materials or discuss processes for decision making and recommendations with appropriate persons. The Chair of the Appeal Committee may also limit the information to be considered based on the scope of the appeal. No representatives from outside the School of Medicine, family members, or individuals with a conflict of interest* are permitted to participate in or communicate with any members of the Appeal Committee regarding the process or finaldecision. The student may be accompanied by a support person, which may be a School of Medicine faculty member, staff member, or student. The support person may not present information or make comment. Following review, the Appeal Committee may make any of the following recommendations: 1) ratify and uphold the CAP decision; 2) remand back to the CAP for re-review; or 3) overturn the decision of the CAP if the committee perceives an inability for the original committee to make an unbiased recommendation. The ad hoc Appeal Committee will communicate its final decision within 14 calendar days of the conclusion of the appeal meeting to the student, the ADSA, the Assistant Dean for Assessment, the CAP Chair, the Registrar, and any other parties deemed necessary. In the case of dismissal, this will be communicated to the Dean or their designee for final review and approval. *For a full explanation of what constitutes a conflict of interest, please see the conflict of interest policy. Please review the Steps in the Formal Appeal Process for CAP Decisions (PDF) (http:// bulletin.wustl.edu/medicine/policies/md-cap-decisions/ Steps_in_the_Formal_Appeal_Process_for_CAP_Decisions.pdf ) for more information. MD: Course Credit Procedures In the Gateway Curriculum, students attain competency based on the totality and sufficiency of evidence regarding their performance in each of the WUSM Medical Student Program Objectives in each of the Competency Domains. The School of Medicine also has a requirement to provide transcript evidence of the successful completion of each course. This document describes the procedures for the determination and documentation of course credit that is independent of the Competency Attainment Committee (CAC) and Clerkship Competency Committee decisions of competency attainment. In the Gateway Curriculum, Phase 1 and 3 courses include the Foundational Modules, Clinical Immersions, EXPLORE Immersions, Advanced Clinical Rotations, Keystone Integrated Science Courses, Capstones, and Electives. Course leads will be responsible for submitting \"credit/no credit\" determinations to the Registrar within 10 business days of the completion of the final course requirement. For each course, a determination of \"credit/no credit\" will be made based on the full completion of required course elements as outlined in the syllabus via the learning management platform for each course. \"No credit\" will be recorded on the transcript until such time as a student has 379Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) completed all required elements, when the \"no credit\" will be replaced with \"credit.\" End-of-course \"no credit\" determinations and the circumstances, when known, will be monitored and brought forward during CAC deliberations. In Phase 2, clerkships are required to provide competency decisions in patient care, rather than \"credit/no credit,\" to the Registrar within 6 weeks of clerkship completion in line with LCME element 9.8, Fair and Timely Summative Assessments. Students who have not completed a required element of the clerkship will receive an \"incomplete\" (I) on the transcript until all required elements are completed. Policies for Legacy Curriculum Students MD: CAPES - Assessing Academic Achievement & Professionalism The policies and procedures listed below are adopted by the faculty and administration of the School of Medicine concerning review of student academic performance and professional integrity. Overall academic and professional evaluation of students at the Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will be made by the Committee on the Academic and Professional Evaluation of Students (CAPES). The Committee on the Academic and Professional Evaluation of Students operates under the Rules Governing Review of Student Performance. Please visit the CAPES (p. 380) section below for more information. Rules Governing Review of Student Performance Preface This document describes procedures adopted by the faculty and administration of the School of Medicine concerning review of student academic performance and professional integrity. Students are encouraged to read this information for a thorough understanding of the contents. Any questions arising from the procedures laid out herein should be directed to the Office of Student Affairs or the Office of the Registrar. Major revisions to this document will be approved by the Academic Affairs Committee. Questions about this document may be directed to: Lisa Moscoso, MD, PhD Associate Dean for Student Affairs Michael Donlan, PhD Assistant Dean for Academic Affairs, RegistrarUpdated Jan. 25, 2018 CAPES - Committee on the Academic and Professional Evaluation of Students Purpose and Jurisdiction Students at the Washington University School of Medicine must demonstrate the ability to synthesize and apply knowledge and the capability of becoming a safe and effective physician. In addition, they must demonstrate the principles of professionalism including sound judgment, honesty, integrity, responsibility, a sensitivity and compassion for individual needs, and compliance with applicable laws, policies and regulations. Serious or repeated academic failures or breaches of these principles in professionalism will be referred to the Committee on the Academic and Professional Evaluation of Students (CAPES) for review. Throughout the enrollment of a student, it is within the jurisdiction of the CAPES to terminate the enrollment of a student who has demonstrated serious academic failure or a breach of professionalism. The deliberations of the CAPES are generally positive in approach and are committed to the ultimate aim of assisting students to successfully complete the courses of study required by the school. The principle that careful selection of students will minimize attrition from the school is strongly endorsed by the CAPES. The text contained herein outlines rules governing the review of student performance. For further information, refer to the Professionalism & Conduct Policies (p. 354) section of this Bulletin. Responsibility of the Committee The ultimate responsibility of the Committee on the Academic and Professional Evaluation of Students (CAPES) is to assess whether each student meets the academic and ethical standards necessary to enter the profession of medicine. To accomplish this mission, CAPES undertakes the following tasks: Student Advancement: The CAPES annually recommends promotion of students who have successfully completed all requirements of the current academic year to the studies of the subsequent year. Degree Recommendations: The CAPES recommends to the Executive Faculty those students who have successfully completed all prescribed requirements of the school and are qualified to receive the Doctor of Medicine degree. Academic Remediation Reviews: When a student is in need of academic support services, the CAPES will recommend student status and remediation measures, which may include entry of a student into an Individualized Study Program. Disciplinary Action: The CAPES will review cases requiring disciplinary action due to unprofessional behavior or a breach of integrity. 380Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) Students for Whom the Rules Apply All students engaged in preclinical and clinical education requirements for the MD degree Students in all years of the Five-Year MD program All students in joint and dual degree programs including but not limited to MD/MPH, MD/MSCI and MD/PhD (MSTP) programs taking preclinical or clinical portions of their MD education Joint or Dual Degree Students: When a student enrolled in a joint or dual degree program is found in violation of the other program's academic or professional integrity policy or is found to have committed any disciplinary violations, including violations of the University Student Conduct Code, such matters may be brought to the attention of the CAPES for review and further action. Notwithstanding decisions made by the other schools or programs, the CAPES reserves the right to take further action when a student is found in violation of such policies. If a student enrolled in a joint or dual degree program is not meeting academic performance expectations of the other program or school such that the student's status in that program or school may be impacted, the CAPES reserves the right to determine whether any action should be taken with respect to the student's status at WUSM. CAPES Membership Appointed and ex officio membership : Twelve voting faculty members of the CAPES are appointed for a four- year term by the dean of the School of Medicine following nomination by the department heads and/or associate deans. Faculty members may be reappointed to serve on the CAPES. Membership will include both clinical and preclinical department faculty. In addition, the CAPES membership will include, in ex officio capacity, the registrar (nonvoting) and the associate dean for student affairs (nonvoting). The senior associate dean, the associate deans for medical education, admissions and diversity programs, and the director of Student Health Services may attend the CAPES meetings as nonvoting participants. Chair: A faculty member will be appointed by the dean from within the CAPES committee to serve as chair. The term of the chair will be four years and may be reappointed. Guests: 1.When the committee is addressing issues related to academic performance, a course director who is not a member of the CAPES but who submitted a Fail/ Incomplete grade for a student who is to be discussed at the meeting will be present at the meeting to provide information regarding the student's performance. A course director may send a designated representative or may submit information in writing. In the event thata course director or designated representative is not present or sufficient information has not been forwarded, final action for the student will be deferred until adequate information is available. 2.Similarly, when the committee is addressing issues of professionalism, the individual filing the professionalism concern form will be present for the meeting or in some instances may be allowed to submit information in writing. 3.Any faculty, administrator or staff may be invited at the discretion of the chair. Meeting Frequency and Quorum The CAPES meetings must occur in a timely manner after final examinations or re-examinations, as soon as practical after grades are submitted to the registrar. Generally grades will be submitted to the registrar within 10 days of completion of an examination. A meeting of the CAPES may also be convened at any time such that timely review of a matter is deemed necessary. Seven voting members must be present to consider academic or disciplinary actions. Grades Grade Scales Courses in the first- and second-year curriculum are evaluated on a pass/fail basis. Third- and fourth-year courses use a graded scale. Specific grades for each grade level are detailed elsewhere in this Bulletin. Grade Submission Final grades will be submitted online within 10 business days of the final examination or final class meeting for the first two years. For the third and fourth years, grades are due within four weeks of the receipt of standardized examination scores or the last day of the rotation if no examination was given. Grade Appeals Students may appeal a grade with the course director by filing a grade appeal request form (https://registrar.med.wustl.edu/ resources/#Forms ). Grade appeals must be filed within 10 business days after the grade has been posted. If reasons beyond the student's control delay the appeal past the July 15 deadline, the registrar must be notified so that the final transcripts, grade distributions and class rankings for the match process can be held pending resolution of the matter. If this notice is not received by the registrar prior to the deadline, the new grade cannot be accepted. Students participating in the residency match process should also notify the office of 381Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) career counseling whenever a grade appeal is in process. After the course director considers any appeal, they will indicate the resolution for the appeal on the grade appeal form and forward it to the registrar and the associate dean for student affairs. No grade changes are permitted for the prior academic year after July 15. Grade Remediation The CAPES may invoke remediation requirements for individual courses that are different from those determined by the course director. In such cases, the CAPES determination will supersede that of the course director. The CAPES may also require the student to repeat a full academic year or portion thereof if it is judged necessary given the academic history. Occasionally, in order to remediate a failed course in the first or second year, students are permitted to complete equivalent course work at other institutions with the permission of the responsible department and written notification to the registrar. Grade Point Average, Ranking and Distribution The School of Medicine does not calculate grade point averages. Hours of credit appearing on the transcript reflect clock hours scheduled for the course or clinical rotation. For the purpose of residency applications only, students are placed in the upper, middle or lower third of the class according to a formula which considers weighting of courses in each academic year. This ranking is not recorded on the permanent academic record and does not appear on transcripts. It may appear in the Medical Student Performance Evaluation ( MSPE). At the conclusion of the academic year, when all the official grades have been received, the official transcript, in addition to listing courses and grades achieved, gives the grade distribution in each course with the exception of elective and selective courses. Academic Support and Accommodations Tutoring Students experiencing difficulty in any course may request tutorial assistance. Such requests should be initially directed toward the course director and thereafter to the associate dean for student affairs. Students who are repeating courses will be offered tutorial assistance, and the CAPES may also require it. There is no charge to the student for tutorial assistance. Individual Study Program Students who have difficulty handling the normal academic course load will enter an Individual Study Program (ISP) requiring five years to complete rather than four years. The intent of an ISP is to optimize the prospect that the student will successfully complete the curriculum. An ISP may be requested by the student or recommended or required by the committee.1.ISP: Scope and Sequence The content and sequence of courses will be determined by the associate dean for student affairs with the input from the student, relevant course directors and the CAPES. The plan for execution of an ISP will be recorded in the student's file in the Registrar's Office and a copy will be provided to the student. 2.ISP: Examination Schedules Unless extenuating circumstances exist, ISP students are required to take the examinations for a particular course in their usual temporal relationship to the course work. Requests for exceptions should be recorded in the student's file in the Office of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. Approval of such requests is considered according to the Washington University School of Medicine guidelines for exam administration found elsewhere in this Bulletin. 3.ISP: Single Fail or Incomplete Grade In the event that a single Fail or Incomplete grade is recorded for a student after entry into an ISP, the CAPES will again review the student's record. Consequences may include remediation, repeat of the course or dismissal from the school. 4.ISP: Grounds for Dismissal Students on an ISP who have not successfully completed and received a grade of Pass or above in all required courses of the first- and second-year curricula by the start of the second six-week period in the year of the clinical clerkship may be dismissed from the school. Accommodations It is the responsibility of students to alert the CAPES regarding personal concerns, health problems, or any other factors that may be adversely affecting their academic performance, and to bring such matters to the attention of the director of Student Health Services or the associate dean for student affairs for possible accommodations. Indications for Review of Academic Performance \"Indications for Review of Academic Performance\" refers to the guidelines used at the school in the event a student either fails exams or a course or fails to complete a course in the requisite time. In general, the school guidelines for the \"Indications for Review of Academic Performance\" are as follows: Exam Failure Exam failures can warrant meeting with the associate dean for student affairs (ADSA) and/or lead to referral to the CAPES. Consult the conditions below for further details relevant to each student-year level. 382Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) Single Course Failure - Meeting with the ADSA In the event of any initial failure of a course the student will meet with the associate dean for student affairs (ADSA) to formulate a remediation plan in coordination with the course director. Multiple Course Failures - Referral to the CAPES Two or more courses in one year If either a failing or incomplete grade in two or more courses occurs in a single year, the student's academic performance will be referred to the CAPES for review and determination of a course of action. Three courses (cumulatively across multiple years) If either a failing or incomplete grade in three courses occurs across multiple years, the student's academic performance will be referred to the CAPES for review and determination of a course of action. Individualized Study Program (ISP) Refer to the ISP section (p. 382) within this CAPES policy for full details on guidelines pertaining to the review of students engaged in an ISP. Time Constraints Three-year rule: No student may take more than three years to complete the course work required for the first two years of study. Time periods included in an approved leave of absence are not counted in these three years. Two-year rule: In the absence of extenuating circumstances or an approved leave of absence, no student may take more than two academic years to complete the course work required in any individual curricular year. Time periods included in an approved leave of absence are not counted in these two years. Maximum Attempts at Passing a Course Students have a maximum number of three attempts to pass any individual course during enrollment in the school. Joint or Dual Degree Program Students If a medical student enrolled in a joint or dual degree program is not making satisfactory academic progress or is not meeting academic performance expectations of the other program or school such that the student's status in that school or program may be impacted, the CAPES reserves the right to determine whether any action should be taken with respect to the student'sstatus within the School of Medicine. Further details pertaining to joint or dual degree program students are listed in the section describing students for whom the rules governing student performance apply. Note: Specific conditions warranting review of academic performance are detailed below for each student-year level. Conditions for review of student performance due to professionalism issues are found in the policy section regarding professionalism. First-Year Students - Indications for Review of Academic Performance All first-year courses must be completed before the start of the second-year curriculum. Failure to meet this requirement typically means one of the following conditions has occurred: Failure of a Single Exam (for First-Year Medical Students) Failure of a single exam is not an immediate indication for review of academic performance by the CAPES. However, failure of a single exam that comprises a significant portion of the final grade (typically 20% or more) must be reported by the course director to the associate dean for student affairs (ADSA). The course director may allow one attempt at remediation of the exam at a time the course director prescribes. The scheduling of the remedial exam will be agreed upon by the course director and the student, but it should generally not extend beyond 30 days after the end of the course. Days of recess for winter and spring break will not be counted in the 30 days. A grade of \"E\" (i.e., temporary grade signifying the pending make-up of a failed exam) will be submitted by the course director if the remedial exam is not accomplished within the course dates. This grade will stand on the academic record until it is replaced with a valid final grade of Pass or Fail. Grades of \"E\" that are not resolved within 30 days will be replaced with a grade of Fail (F). In rare circumstances, the ADSA may approve an extension of this deadline. If the student successfully remediates the exam, and has otherwise passed the course, a Pass (P) will be recorded by the registrar. A student may remediate only one examination in any course. Failure of Two or More Exams The ADSA may request that the CAPES reviews performance of a student who has failed two or more examinations. In such cases, the CAPES will recommend a course of action. Failure of a Course If a student receives a Fail/Incomplete grade in a single first- year course, the ADSA will meet with the student to formulate a remediation plan in coordination with the course director. The remediation plan may include the following options: 383Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) Take a re-examination as approved by the course director. Enroll in and successfully complete, at the level designated by the course director, a summer course at a different institution, such a course being completed and passed by the beginning of the second year. If a student fails to successfully complete an approved summer course or fails the re-examination taken to remediate a failed course, they will be referred to the CAPES for review and recommended course of action. The CAPES may require the student to enter an ISP or be dismissed from the school. The CAPES may permit a second re-examination. If the second re- examination is failed, the student will be dismissed from the school. Failure of Two or More Courses A student for whom the registrar has recorded a Fail/Incomplete grade in two or more courses during the first year will be referred to the CAPES for determination of a course of action. The committee may decide to permit the student to take re- examinations, if a re-examination has not already been taken. Such re-examinations will generally occur during the inter- academic year break. If a re-examination is failed the student may be required to enter an ISP or be dismissed from the school. Second-Year Students - Indications for Review of Academic Performance Students in their second year will be referred to either the associate dean for student affairs (ADSA) or the CAPES for review and resolution of a recommended course of action when any one of the following conditions has occurred: Conditions for Meeting with the ADSA for Second-Year Students Failure of a single interval exam within a year-long course or failure of one block-long course (for Second-Year Students): An initial failure of a single exam does not signal an automatic referral to the CAPES. A second-year student who receives a final grade of Fail or Incomplete in a single interval exam in a year-long course will first meet with the ADSA. A second-year student receiving a failing/incomplete grade in one block-long course must first meet with the associate dean for student affairs (ADSA).Re-examination Scheduling and Resolution Re-examinations for year-long courses will generally be offered during the inter-academic year break, prior to entry into the third year. Re-examinations for individual block-long courses will generally be offered at a time determined by the course director and the ADSA. All such re-exams must be offered to students and completed prior to the start of the next academic year. Students failing the re-examination of a single block-long course (or failing a re-examination of a single year-long course) will be referred to the CAPES to determine a course of action. If the examination is failed for a third time, enrollment will be terminated. Deferral of Clinical Rotation Start Date The CAPES may allow the student to defer beginning the clinical rotations so that re-examinations may be taken up to six weeks after the beginning of the usual cycle of clinical clerkships. Such extra time used for study and preparation will ordinarily mean that the student will not have the usual unscheduled time in the elective year. Note: No student is permitted to begin Clinical Rotations of the Third Year until all first- and second-year courses have been successfully completed. If Re-examinations Are Not Allowed ISP: In the event that the CAPES decides to not permit re- examination, an ISP may be recommended. Dismissal/Termination: The CAPES has the option to recommend any such student be dismissed. Conditions for Referral to the CAPES for Second-Year Students Second-year students will be referred to the CAPES for review and resolution under any of the following categories: 1.Failure of an interval exam in one year-long course and one block-long course 2.Failure of two interval exams in year-long courses 3.Failure or Incomplete recorded in any re-examination 4.Failure or Incomplete grade in one year-long course 5.Failure or Incomplete grades in two or more block-long courses Remediation for Second-Year Students Reviewed by the CAPES Re-examinations allowed: The committee may permit the student to take re-examinations in the courses for which a Fail or Incomplete has been recorded (provided that a re-examination has not already been taken for a given course). Such re-exams will generally occur during 384Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) the inter-academic year break. Note: In the event that a Fail/ Incomplete grade is recorded after a re-examination, the CAPES may require that a student enter an ISP or that enrollment in the School of Medicine be terminated. The CAPES may decide that a second re-examination may be offered. Cumulative Academic Review (at End of Second Year) Prior to promotion to the clerkship year, the CAPES will review the cumulative academic record of each student brought forth by the associate dean for student affairs (ADSA) to determine whether the student's academic performance justifies advancement to the clinical phase of the medical education without warning. Typically, multiple remediated examinations and/or failing grades during the first two years of the curriculum will raise concerns about the student's knowledge and readiness to participate in clinical care of patients. Students with overall records indicating globally poor performance may have one of the following actions taken upon them with written notification: Required to repeat specific preclinical course work Advancement to Clinical Year with Academic Warning, with a required meeting with the ADSA in order to - Review and pursue available resources for academic intervention Review and plan an effective clerkship schedule to consider schedule changes helping to facilitate successful clinical experiences Recommend students seek tutorial assistance through each clerkship director and address any additional or unique circumstances Probation - Contingencies for continued enrollment on probationary status and for return to good standing will be specified by the CAPES. Dismissal - Globally poor performance may be deemed grounds for dismissal by the CAPES. In addition, a third-year student who is advanced with academic warning and then fails any component of a clinical clerkship may be dismissed from the school. Indications for Review of Academic Performance for Third and Subsequent Years Failure of any core clinical rotation without successful remediation will prevent proper advancement toward the student's degree and may result in significant consequences for career planning. For these reasons, the following list itemizes the conditions under which the CAPES committee will convene.Failure of One Course Required for Third or Subsequent Years The ADSA will meet with any student for whom a single Fail/ Incomplete/E grade has been recorded for a course beyond the second year of the MD curriculum. Discussion will include the requirements stipulated by the relevant course director in order to remediate the academic encumbrance. Options will generally include a re-examination or the repeating of all or a portion of the course. If a single failing grade for a clerkship course or elective has been recorded, the student may be referred to the CAPES for review and course of action. If a Fail grade has been entered following the prescribed remediation, the student will always be referred to the CAPES to determine a course of action . When such a student is referred to the CAPES, the committee may permit a re-examination or retaking/ repeating of all or any portion of the course. If the course is failed a third time, the student will be dismissed from school. Failure of any Component of a Clerkship while on Academic Warning A student who advances to the clinical years under academic warning, and who fails any component of a clerkship will be referred to the CAPES for action including possible dismissal from the school. If Poor Academic Performance is Reported for Two or More Courses The ADSA may request that the CAPES review performance of a student who has been reported as having demonstrated poor academic performance in two or more courses at interval evaluations conducted throughout the courses. In such instances, the CAPES may determine a course of action. Failure of Two or More NBME Subject/Shelf Examinations Any student who fails to achieve a passing grade on any two or more NBME subject/shelf examinations conducted as part of any clerkship evaluation will be referred to the CAPES for review and course of action. Note: A passing grade for any subject/shelf examination is defined as any score greater than or equal to the 10th percentile as reported by the NBME. Recording of Failed Grades, Remediation, Re-examinations, Repercussions, or Dismissal (for Students in their Third Year and Beyond ) A student who fails any clinical component of a clerkship or elective will have a Fail grade recorded on the permanent academic record. At the discretion of the course director or the CAPES, the student must repeat either the portion failed or the entire clerkship or elective in order to remove the academic degree encumbrance. The failing grade will, however, remain visible on the permanent academic record. Any new passing 385Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) grade for any such remediated course will display on the transcript; thus, both the original failing grade and the newly recorded grade for the course will be visible on the permanent academic record. In addition, a failing grade for clinical clerkships will be officially recorded onto the permanent academic record whenever a student fails the subject/shelf examination for the second time. A failing grade is defined as a score of less than the 10th percentile as reported by the NBME. For students referred to the CAPES for failed/incomplete grades, the committee may endorse or amend the remediation recommendations of the corresponding course director(s). In the event a student fails a course remediation defined by the course director and approved by the CAPES, the CAPES may require that the clerkship rotation be repeated or that enrollment of the student in the school be terminated. Students will generally be permitted three attempts to achieve a passing grade in any clerkship course. If three failing NBME subject examination grades or final clerkship grades have been submitted for a course, the student will be dismissed from the school. Procedures Concerning Review of Academic Performance A. Convening a Meeting Actions for Academic Review of students shall be referred to the CAPES for consideration by way of the associate dean for student affairs (ADSA) or registrar. The ADSA will convene a meeting of the CAPES, notifying the student in writing regarding the reason for the review and the date, time, and place of the meeting. A meeting of the CAPES may be convened at any time when a timely review of an issue is deemed necessary. B. Attendees The associate dean for student affairs, the registrar, and the course director(s) or their designated representatives shall present the matter to the CAPES in a closed and confidential CAPES meeting. C. Student Responsibility All students will be asked to be available to appear before the committee to provide additional information relevant to the concern. If the student fails to be available to appear at the meeting, the committee may postpone the meeting or may conduct the meeting and impose sanctions without the student present. Failure of a student to appear or provide information requested by the CAPES may result in the committee's filing a professionalism concern form. Meetings may be rescheduled at the discretion of the CAPES chair.It is the responsibility of the student to alert the CAPES of any extenuating circumstances or contributing factors that should be considered regarding the student's status. The student shall be permitted, upon request in advance of the CAPES meeting, to appear before the CAPES on their own behalf. At the student's request, they may be accompanied by a member of the faculty, staff or fellow student of the school. D. Student Record Considered A student's entire academic and professionalism record will be considered in deliberations regarding student status. E. Meeting Minutes A record of the CAPES meeting shall be preserved and will be available for review by the School of Medicine's Appeals Committee, as necessary. F. Outcomes Possible Actions taken by the CAPES may include but are not limited to dismissal, suspension, probation, defined penalty, advancement with academic warning, remediation, and/or additional oversight. The CAPES may also rule that the MSPE/Dean's Letter should include a citation regarding the matter. The CAPES decision shall be made by simple majority unless the vote is for dismissal which requires a three-fourths majority. G. Notifying Students of Final Committee Decisions The associate dean for student affairs will inform the student verbally of the decision of the CAPES. The registrar will inform the student in writing within 10 business days. Indications for Review of Professional Integrity Matters involving a possible breach of professional integrity shall be brought to the attention of the associate dean for student affairs. The individual(s) raising the questions of possible misconduct shall present a Professionalism Concern Form (https://registrar.med.wustl.edu/resources/#Forms ) providing detailed written information as necessary. Individuals submitting such forms are reminded of the need for complete confidentiality regarding all matters of conduct. Behaviors inappropriate to the medical profession shall include but are not limited to: cheating or unauthorized use of materials during examinations abuse misrepresentations other seriously improper conduct in relation to patients or colleagues breach of confidentiality and trust misconduct in violation of university policies 386Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) violation of the University Student Conduct Code illegalities substance abuse failure of judgment including that related to noncompliance in the treatment of any personal medical condition misrepresentation or failure in personal actions or meeting obligations any combination of the above items, and others which might raise serious unresolved doubts about the integrity of the student with regards to entering the practice of medicine For more information, consult the Professionalism & Conduct Policies (p. 354) section of this Bulletin. Procedures Concerning Review of Professional Integrity At the discretion of the associate dean for student affairs, in cases of serious or repeated breaches of professional integrity, the associate dean for student affairs will convene a meeting with the associate dean for admissions, the associate dean for medical student education, or the senior associate dean for medical education to review the complaint(s) and to decide whether further action is necessary. If further inquiry is deemed necessary, the associate dean for student affairs and either the associate dean for medical student education, the associate dean for admissions, or the senior associate dean for medical education will discuss the complaint with the student. If the two associate deans deem that further action is warranted, the following procedure will occur: A. Convening of Meeting The associate dean for student affairs will convene a meeting of the CAPES. Whenever possible, the CAPES shall convene within two weeks after the initial meeting between the student and the associate dean for student affairs. If the person bringing the complaint is a member of the CAPES, they will not vote but may participate in the discussion. If the person bringing the complaint is not a member of the CAPES, they will be asked to present the complaint and will then be excused. The CAPES chairperson will oversee the procedures of the meeting. The registrar will record the minutes. B. Gathering of Pertinent Information and Meeting Attendees Prior to the meeting, the associate dean for student affairs will forward information concerning the matter to the committee. In addition the associate dean for student affairs will inform the student in writing regarding the time, date and place of the meeting. A copy of the complaint will be provided to the student. The notification shall state that the proceedings are confidential. The student may bring a faculty member, staff member or fellow student for guidance and support. If this person is not a fact witness to the complaint, they may not address the committee.C. Student Responsibility Any student to be considered at a CAPES meeting will be asked to be available to appear before the committee to provide additional information relevant to the concern. If the student fails to be available for the meeting, the committee may postpone the meeting or may conduct the meeting and impose sanctions without the student present. Failure of a student to appear or provide information requested by the CAPES may result in the committee's drawing adverse conclusions. Meetings may be rescheduled at the discretion of the CAPES chair. D. Student Record and Pertinent Documentation/Materials The CAPES will consider evidence which tends to prove or disprove the alleged conduct. If the CAPES finds that the student engaged in misconduct, it may consider additional evidence of prior conduct, evidence as to the charged student's character, the student's entire academic and disciplinary record, or any other evidence which would assist the CAPES in determining appropriate action. The chair of the CAPES will rule on whether or not evidence or testimony will be considered. The CAPES has neither the advantages nor limitations inherent in a court of law. During the meeting the student will have access to the written evidence presented and may present evidence and fact witnesses on their own behalf. The student should be prepared to discuss the circumstances of the complaint after which the CAPES will excuse the student from the room. E. Objective Approach By Committee The purpose of the CAPES meeting is to provide fair and prompt review of the inquiry. The committee is not positioned in an adversarial role against the student, but simply serves to review the evidence as presented and determine a decision regarding disciplinary action if necessary. The decision as to whether the student committed the alleged act will be made solely on the basis of evidence and testimony presented at the meeting. Innocence of the student will be presumed. A CAPES member must find in favor of the student unless the member is persuaded that it is more likely than not that the student engaged in the alleged misconduct. F. Outcomes Possible Actions taken by the CAPES may include but are not limited to dismissal, suspension, probation, defined penalty, fine and restitution, advancement with academic warning, remediation and/or additional oversight. Contingencies for continued enrollment on probationary status and for return to good standing will be specified by the CAPES in each individual case. The CAPES may also rule that the MSPE/Dean's Letter should include a citation regarding the matter. The CAPES decision shall be made by simple majority unless the vote is for dismissal which requires a three-fourths majority. 387Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) G. Notifying Student of Committee Decisions The associate dean for student affairs will inform the student verbally of the decision of the CAPES. The registrar will inform the student in writing within 10 business days. H. Meeting Minutes and Confidentiality The record of such proceedings will be held confidentially with access restricted to committee members, the student involved and relevant members of the administration. I. Disclaimers The university does not tolerate retaliation against individuals who bring forward complaints or who participate in the CAPES process. Unless determined by the associate dean for student affairs that extraordinary circumstances exist, the student will be permitted to continue in the usual academic activities during CAPES proceedings. However, if there is a reasonable basis for believing that the continued presence of the student on campus or in clinical rotations poses a substantial threat to the student, to patients, or to the rights of others to engage in their normal university functions and activities, the procedure outlined under the school's Leave of Absence Policy (p. 394) will apply. J. Both Academic Performance and Professionalism Concerns Exist Should a student be referred to the CAPES for an issue involving both academic performance and professionalism concerns, the procedures for Professionalism Concerns will be followed. Appeals Process The School of Medicine has the right and responsibility to assure that each student, during the time of enrollment, demonstrates levels of academic achievement and ethical stature appropriate to the practice of medicine. The school must also ensure provision of fairness in discharging those rights and responsibilities. As such, an appeals process is in place as outlined below: A. Request for an Appeal Within 14 working days of the date on which an academic or disciplinary decision is rendered by the CAPES, the student may request in writing to the registrar, that the School of Medicine's Appeals Committee review the record of the CAPES decision to determine that the appropriate CAPES procedures were followed or that the Appeals Committee requests that the CAPES consider additional, new relevant information which was not previously presented to the CAPES for good cause. The letter to the registrar should include the basis for appeal as well as any new relevant information and an explanation as to why it was not timely presented to the CAPES.B. Establishing an Appeals Committee An Appeals Committee, composed of faculty members appointed by the dean of the School of Medicine, shall be created to review appeal of decisions by the CAPES. Members of the CAPES may not be appointed to the Appeals Committee. A quorum of this committee shall consist of five members. C. Review by the Appeals Committee The Appeals Committee shall review the record of the CAPES decision solely to determine whether the pertinent CAPES procedures were followed and whether all relevant information was considered by the CAPES. If the appeal is based on a contention that all relevant information was not presented to the CAPES, the written appeal must provide the Appeals Committee with adequate reason why the student did not present this information at the CAPES meeting in question. In all cases, the Appeals Committee shall not substitute its judgment of the facts or its opinions of the merit of the matter for those of the CAPES. D. Appeals Committee Decision Types 1.Remand the case to the CAPES The Appeals Committee may decide to remand the matter to the CAPES for reconsideration with its explanation for the remand. If the matter is remanded to the CAPES, all documents, minutes of the Appeals Committee meeting, and information submitted by or for the student in support of the appeal will be made available to the CAPES. 2.Denial The Appeals Committee may decide to deny the appeal. E. Decision Notification to the Student The Appeals Committee shall provide its decision in writing to the student, the dean of the School of Medicine, the associate dean for student affairs and the registrar. The associate dean for student affairs shall determine whether the student may continue their curriculum pending the Appeals Committee review of a CAPES decision. F. Student Appeal to the Dean Within 10 business days of the date of an Appeals Committee decision, the student may request in writing that the dean of the School of Medicine review the decision of the Appeals Committee. The decision of the dean of the School of Medicine shall be final. Glossary The following definitions are applied when the indicated terms are used in relation to the foregoing rules concerning review of academic performance and professional integrity: Academic Warning, Advancement with 388Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) A supervised status that may be imposed if a student's cumulative academic review indicates that special oversight is warranted. Refer to the sections on Cumulative Academic Review and Academic Warning for additional information. Action, Disciplinary An action, including counseling and penalties, taken by the School of Medicine, after consideration of the disciplinary problem. Administrative Withdrawal Termination of a student's enrollment from or eligibility to return to the School of Medicine by the university where the student has: A. failed to register and has not sought a leave of absence; or B. not returned from an approved leave of absence within the designated period of time and where an extension of the leave of absence has not been timely requested and approved by the CAPES. Dismissal, Academic Involuntary separation of a student from the School of Medicine because they have not met the academic requirements. Dismissal, Disciplinary Involuntary separation of a student from the School of Medicine as a result of action taken because of misconduct. Good Standing As a record or transcript notation, it signifies that the student is eligible to continue, to return, or to transfer elsewhere. It implies good academic standing as well as good citizenship and replaces such terms previously used as honorable dismissal, honorable withdrawal, withdrawn, voluntary withdrawal, eligible to return and clear record. Grade, Incomplete Indicates there is still a possibility of credit after further work. Used when the instructor is not prepared to give a final mark for the term in view either of sickness of the student or some justifiable delay in the completion of certain work. It is accompanied by a note that explains the circumstances and indicates how and when the incomplete may be resolved. A definitive mark for the term is recorded on the official transcript when the work is completed and the incomplete grade is removed. In case the work is not completed within the time allowed, the recorded grade will be changed to fail. Permanent Academic Record The all-inclusive abstract of academic achievement. This is also commonly referred to as the official educational record or official transcript.Probation Probation status may be for academic and for disciplinary reasons. Academic probation is the result of unsatisfactory scholarship. It is not a penalty but a warning and provides an opportunity to improve. Usually the student is required to make regular specified improvement in his record in order to avoid dismissal. Disciplinary probation is the middle status between good standing and suspension or dismissal. The student remains enrolled but under stated conditions according to school policies. Disciplinary probation covers a stated trial period during which it is determined whether the student is returned to good standing having met the stated requirements or dismissed from enrollment at the end of the period for failure to meet the stated requirements. Professionalism Concern Form A form completed by a member of the university community to communicate an instance of unprofessional behavior to the associate dean for student affairs. Serious or repeated instances of unprofessional behavior may be referred to the CAPES by the associate dean for student affairs. Suspension Suspension is an involuntary separation of the student from the school but it differs from dismissal from enrollment in that it implies and states a time limit when return will be possible. Thus, suspension may extend for a specified time, until a specified date or until a stated condition is met. Withdrawal A release from enrollment. A student may request that they be allowed to withdraw from enrollment. Such requests are directed to the registrar or the associate dean for student affairs. When a student has requested withdrawal status, the school, by action of the CAPES, will determine whether the withdrawal will be annotated with good standing or not in good standing in the official academic record. Such annotations may be accompanied by explanations in the official educational record.

MD: Grade Point Average, Class Ranking, and Grade Distributions For more information about grade-point average, class ranking, and grade distributions, please visit the Assessing Academic Achievement & Professionalism (p. 380) section of this Bulletin. MD: Grading System I. First and Second Year Courses in the first-year and second-year curriculum are evaluated on a Pass (P) or Fail (F) basis. For purposes of the final official grade records of the School of Medicine, grades used for the first year and second year are as follows: P = Pass, indicating satisfactory performance F = Fail; any grade of F remains on the student's academic record. When the course is repeated or remediated the new grade will appear as a separate entry in addition to the failing grade. L = Successful audit NG = Course credit earned, students not graded W = Withdrawal from a course Z = Unsuccessful audit Valid temporary grades include the following: E = Temporary grade, makeup of failed exam pending I = Incomplete, temporary grade pending completion of course requirements, replaced with an F if not removed within one year (In rare instances, the Committee on the Academic and Professional Evaluation of Students [CAPES] may grant an extension. Incomplete indicates that, because of a delay excused by the course director, the student has not completed the requirements to pass a course.) II. Subsequent Years For purposes of the final official grade records of the School of Medicine, the following grades are used for subsequent years:H = Honors, reflecting a truly outstanding performance HP = High Pass, awarded for excellent/very good work P = Pass, indicating satisfactory performance F = Fail (Any grade of F remains on the student's academic record. In clinical clerkships that have a subject examination, students must score at or above the 10th percentile of the national pool of students taking the examination to pass the clerkship. If a student fails a shelf examination for the second time in a third-year clerkship, an F is recorded on the permanent record.) When the course is repeated or remediated, the new grade will appear as a separate entry in addition to the failing grade. Cr/NCr = Credit/No Credit for select second- and fourth-year courses L = Successful audit NG = Course credit earned, students not graded W = Withdrawal from a course Z = Unsuccessful audit Valid temporary grades include the following: E = Temporary grade, makeup of failed exam pending (In clinical clerkships that have a subject examination, students must score at or above the 10th percentile of the national pool of students taking the examination to pass the clerkship. If a student fails the subject examination once, the grade of E will be recorded. Upon successfully retaking the subject examination, the new grade will replace the grade of E on the permanent academic record. If the shelf examination is failed a second time, the grade of F is recorded on the permanent academic record.) I = Incomplete, temporary grade pending completion of course requirements, replaced with an F if not removed within one year (In rare instances, the CAPES may grant an extension. Incomplete indicates that, because of a delay excused by the course director, the student has not completed the requirements to pass a course.) MD: Professionalism Preamble Medicine is one of the oldest of the learned professions. A professional is one who is in command of a specialized body of knowledge and skills, and is given specific rights not typically allowed to the public. Along with those rights, the professional has specific responsibilities or duties not generally expected of the public. 390Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) The singularity of medicine is that it deals with human health. Patients are potentially at their most vulnerable when establishing a relationship with a physician. That the patient's relationship with their physician involves a dependency that encompasses life and death adds further to the uniqueness of this relationship. The label of professional is not a right but must be earned. The special contract physicians have with society has professionalism as its foundation. Professionalism consists of fundamentally important qualities including altruism, compassion and empathy, respect for patients and health care workers, commitment to ongoing excellence, honesty, trustworthiness, integrity, accountability, recognition of limits, collaboration, and duty to society. Professional development is an ongoing process at all levels of training and practice. The purpose of this document is to outline those elements of professionalism expected of our medical students. It is not meant to be all-encompassing, providing exact guidelines for all possible situations. While this document was developed with medical students in mind, it is generally applicable to all medical professionals. The goal of the Washington University Medical Center is to provide patient care, medical education, and biomedical research of the highest quality. Accomplishing this goal depends in part, also, on an atmosphere of mutual respect and collegiality among all those who work and study here. This document focuses on the special issues presented by the teacher/learner relationship, as well, and applies to all years of the medical school curriculum. Guiding Principles of Professionalism Professional Responsibility 1.Students have a responsibility to actively participate in their education and to work to improve the educational environment for future students. 2.Students should have a willingness to pursue lifelong, self- directed learning, which is an essential attribute of any professional. 3.Students should act responsibly in their personal and academic lives with regard to meeting deadlines, financial obligations and other comparable responsibilities. 4.Preparation for class and during clinical rotations sets a good example for peers, maximizes every student's learning opportunity, and demonstrates respect for the teachers and peers. a.Respecting one's peers in a classroom or in the hospital setting includes behaviors such as arriving on time, exhibiting respectful body language, listening attentively, turning off cell phones and allowing all present to engage in discussion.5.Students should report to the appropriate supervisor potentially serious errors that others have committed. 6.Students should contribute to their community. a.Students are encouraged to participate in the first- and second-year teaching groups. b.These provide a service to the larger St. Louis community, while teaching students how to communicate with people of diverse backgrounds. c.Students are encouraged to serve at the Saturday Neighborhood Health Clinic and other community service and teaching activities. 7.Students should be aware of the larger social and economic context in which disease occurs, and take advantage of opportunities to deepen their knowledge about this topic. Competence and Self-Improvement 1.In order to function at the expected level, students should attend to their own physical and emotional health. a.The experience of being a medical student can be physically and emotionally challenging. Students need to be able to identify when they are overwhelmed to the point where they may not be able to function appropriately. Students are encouraged to seek educational assistance and/or the emotional support of others in these instances. 2.Recognizing and admitting errors in patient care are key to being a good physician. a.Students should view mistakes as part of learning. Assuming responsibility for mistakes is critical for professional development. b.Developing productive strategies for dealing with mistakes and non-confrontational ways of correcting them is essential. 3.Feedback, advice and criticism from residents, fellows and faculty fosters personal and professional development, and should be taken in the context of mentoring. a.Students should assume that opinions of their faculty/ residents/fellows that may seem unclear are usually solidly founded, and accept feedback regarding their performance openly and maturely from individuals more experienced than they. b.Students should provide suggestions and examples for improving the mentoring environment by forthrightly evaluating their instructors. 4.Students should identify and correct errors in patient care as soon as possible or notify those who can correct it. 5.Students should balance personal and professional interests. a.Students should not over-commit. b.Students should communicate schedule conflicts to course directors, lecturers, and/or house staff. 391Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) Respect for Others and Professional Relationships 1.Students should conduct themselves with manners and consideration of all others, and be respectful of others' time. 2.While individual effort is important in developing a medical knowledge base, much of what students learn in medical school will depend on a collaborative effort with their peers. a.From the first day of medical school, students should encourage each other and collaborate with their peers when appropriate in the learning environments of lectures, small group discussions, and lab sessions. In doing so, they are laying the foundation for the truly collaborative nature of medicine. b.During the clinical years, students should understand that their peers are a valuable resource. Likewise, a student should assist peers in patient care responsibilities. c.In all cases, students should respect the work and learning opportunities of their classmates and they should share educational opportunities with their peers. Professional behaviors include listening to other's presentations, and encouraging others' opportunities to present, ask/answer questions, admit patients, participate in surgical cases/procedures, or perform duties. 3.Respect for the ethnic and cultural diversity of classmates provides for a more nurturing environment for all. a.Students should be aware that their classmates come from a wide variety of religious and ethnic backgrounds and that they will have differing lifestyles and viewpoints. This diversity is an important resource in our community, contributing to the personal and professional growth of all. b.Students should be sensitive to the importance of these issues and should seek opportunities to enhance appreciation of multiple cultures through dialog, educational opportunities, etc. 4.Students should be supportive of peers during difficult times in their personal and professional lives. a.Students must appreciate that their peers may have issues in their personal or professional lives (e.g., family, medical, academic, or administrative problems) that may affect their interactions with others. In these circumstances, students should make every attempt to be sympathetic and to offer their support to those students. 5.Participation and teamwork enhances the educational experience.a.The learning process is a partnership between students and faculty. Students should actively participate in this partnership by providing feedback to professors by way of evaluations and surveys. b.Contributing to the overall functioning of the team maximizes both learning and patient care in the clinical setting. 6.Understanding the appropriate venues for feedback to house staff/fellows/faculty is critical to successfully resolving conflicts. Students should be aware of the hierarchy of the team, and appropriate mechanisms for handling disagreement with faculty/residents/fellows. Conflicts can be translated into productive outcomes if handled appropriately. For additional helpful information, reference the university Code of Conduct (https://universitycompliance.wustl.edu/ code-of-conduct/ ). 7.Maintaining a professional relationship with teachers (including faculty/residents/fellows and TAs) is important, especially during times when these teachers are in a position to grade or evaluate the student. a.Students should avoid behaviors that could potentially be construed as attempting to influence the faculty, for example running personal errands. b.The university has specific codes and regulations regarding romantic relationships between a student and a teacher, including faculty/resident/fellows outlined in the Consensual Relationships Policy (https:// hr.wustl.edu/items/consensual-relationships/ ). Students engaged in such relationships should review these codes and avoid any situation that can cause potential conflict of interest in the academic setting. 8.Patients should be treated as individuals in the context of their family, culture and community. Personal bias should be subordinated when possible to further the therapeutic relationship. a.Use of offensive language or gestures is unacceptable. b.At times, some religious beliefs will require the use of alternative care approaches. c.Students, like practicing physicians, should not refuse to participate in the care of a patient with a communicable disease unless this represents a meaningful threat to the student's own health. In contrast, a student who is verbally or physically threatened by a patient may ask to be excused from care of that patient. 9.Students should treat hospital staff with appreciation and respect as they are vital members of the health care team. Honesty and Integrity 1.Student work should be original. a.Only authorized resources should be used during examinations, quizzes or graded course work. WUSM has a zero tolerance policy for plagiarism (https:// studentconduct.wustl.edu/academic-integrity/ ). 392Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) b.When students are aware that a classmate has submitted work that is not their own (cheated), they should discuss this situation with the course director and/ or the associate dean for student affairs. 2.Students must respect patients' rights and maintain confidentiality, in accordance with HIPAA guidelines. a.Students should be ever aware that patients are ill and have the right to refuse care, particularly when poorly provided. b.Patient information should only be discussed with appropriate people at appropriate times. c.Patient records should not be photocopied carelessly or removed from appropriate areas. d.Patient information should be disposed of appropriately to prevent careless transmission of patient information. 3.Students should clearly communicate their abilities and level of training to patients. a.If a student does not know the answer to a patient's question, it is the student's responsibility to admit this lack of knowledge. b.Even if other members of the health care team introduce students to patients as \"doctor,\" the student should never do so as it leads to a false perception of expertise on the patient's part. c.Students should always be truthful with the house staff and other medical staff in terms of patient care and never compromise patient care as a consequence of personal gain. 4.Students should not participate in any aspect of patient care if under the influence of a substance that may compromise the student's judgment or otherwise cause the patient harm. Likewise, students should report any member of the health care team who may be participating in patient care while under the influence of a judgment-impairing substance. 5.Any student who is impaired by physical or psychological illness should excuse themselves from patient care responsibilities, and should also respect recommendations to do so from colleagues or supervisors. 6.Although students are often tired or under stress, they should attempt to maintain an appropriate level of composure at all times. 7.Students should be appropriately attired for all patient care duties. 8.Students should carefully consider their participation in benefits provided by pharmaceutical companies or other medically-related businesses. 9.Students should respect the laws of federal, state and local governments in both professional and private life.Related Policies Washington University Discrimination and Harassment Policy (http://hr.wustl.edu/policies/Pages/ DiscriminationAndHarassment.aspx ) Washington University Sexual Assault Policy (https://wustl.edu/ Washington University Abusive Conduct Policy (https:// University Diversity Bias Report Form (http:// diversity.wustl.edu/students/mosaic/bias-report-support-system/ bias-report-form/ ) Assessing Academic Achievement & Professionalism (MD Program) (p. 380) MD: Remediation For more information about remediation, please visit the Assessing Academic Achievement & Professionalism (p. 380) section of this Bulletin. MD: Clerkship Grade Appeals Background Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) is committed to rigorous, equitable, and credible processes for the assessment and grading of our students. Students who do not feel their grade accurately reflects their performance because of (1) a failure to follow a course's stated processes for gathering and judging assessment evidence or (2) unfair bias have the right to appeal the grade. The Grade Appeal Policy at WUSM is in place to allow for the identification and \u2014 if confirmed \u2014 remediation of a systematic error in the assessment and/or grading process outlined in the relevant course syllabus and/or policies. In keeping with LCME standards 9.9, 10.3, and 11.6, we adhere to the following policy for the appeal of all clerkship grades at WUSM. Policy If a student believes there was a systematic error in the assessment and/or grading process or the presence of bias as stated above, they may file a formal appeal. Students wishing to appeal their grade must do so by filing a Grade Appeal Form (https://wustl.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6YFTYDqu1I5c5ds/ ) within 10 business days after final grades are due for a given course per WUSM's Grade Notification Policy (p. 364). Grade appeals received after this deadline will not be accepted unless approved by the Director of Student Assessment and the Registrar in the case of unusual circumstances outside the student's control (e.g., a clerkship posts a final grade after WUSM's deadline). 393Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) The student must provide a detailed explanation of the basis for the appeal and pertinent documentation. Any factors not directly relevant to the assessment of performance within the specific course/clerkship (e.g., a student's stated career goals) cannot be taken into consideration when processing a grade appeal. The Clerkship Director, Associate/Assistant Clerkship Director, and/or their designee will investigate the basis of the student's appeal. They will meet with the student (either in person or via virtual meeting) and any other stakeholders as needed to investigate the appeal, following which they will render a decision. If the student still perceives systematic flaws in the process or bias impacted the final outcome of the grading and/or appeals process, they can submit a second appeal to the Associate Dean for Medical Student Education. They must do so within 10 business days of the decision of the Clerkship Director/ Associate/Assistant Clerkship Director during the original appeal. The Associate Dean for Medical Student Education will convene an ad hoc appeals committee to adjudicate the appeal based on adherence to the stated processes of the clerkship for assessment and grading. In the event that this ad hoc committee finds systematic flaws or bias in the grading process, they will render a new review of the assessment evidence and a new judgment. The appeals committee will reach a decision by majority vote ordinarily within 21 days of receipt of the second appeal. The Associate Dean for Medical Student Education retains discretion to make reasonable adjustments to this timeline as necessary. If identified, patterns of failure to adhere to procedures by a grading committee will be addressed by the Director of Student Assessment. In the event that evidence of bias in the grading process is found, this will be considered a failure of the original grading decision to adequately adhere to the predetermined processes, and the appeals committee will issue a new grade. The appeals committee must also provide a summary of the evidence to the course director, the Associate Dean of Student Affairs, and the Director of Student Assessment. Further handling of the matter will take place according to WUSM's Policy Against Medical Student Mistreatment and other applicable policies. Guidelines Students are advised that feedback from any one individual front-line assessor does not guarantee a specific grade. Front- line assessors are not in a position to grade students. The perceived absence of formative/constructive feedback from any individual front-line assessor similarly does not guarantee a specific grade. Receiving insufficient feedback cannot be the sole basis for a grade appeal. If a student feels that they are getting insufficient feedback, even after asking, they are encouraged to discuss this with the course director before the end of the course.When relevant, mid-course/clerkship feedback is not a guarantee of any specific final clinical grade. Students actively participating in the residency match process should also notify the office of career counseling whenever a grade appeal is in process. The Washington University School of Medicine Clerkship Grade Appeals Policy was last approved by the Academic Affairs Committee on July 8, 2021. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Academic Affairs Committee. MD: Absence Policy for Medical Students on Clinical Rotations Background The profession of medicine requires the utmost commitment of time and energy to patient care and research activities. While the development of this commitment begins in the preclinical years, it is further practiced and developed during clinical training. The clinical year at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) comprises 48 weeks of required core clinical experiences. The fourth year encompasses a 44-week time block and requires MD students take a minimum of 36 weeks of credit (32 weeks of electives plus four weeks of Capstone). MSTP students are required to take a minimum of 12 weeks of credit (eight weeks of electives plus four weeks of Capstone). All students on clinical rotations have a scheduled two-week winter recess break and a three-day spring break. All clinical students have a two-week break between the end of the third- year clinical rotations and the start of the fourth-year elective rotations. During every clinical rotation, each student is expected to participate fully in all activities of the clinical rotation until the designated end time of the clinical rotation or the start time of a holiday break. This regularly requires participation beyond formal weekday hours to include evening and nighttime call and clinical responsibilities on weekends. In keeping with LCME standard 12.4, all students requiring access to necessary diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic care for both acute and chronic health concerns are to be excused from clinical training per the Washington University School of Medicine Access to Healthcare Services Policy. (p. 362) Students must recognize that clinical teaching, learning and evaluation are dependent on the student's presence and participation in every aspect of the clinical rotation. While students will not be graded down only because of an excused absence, time spent away from the rotation may decrease learning and impede effective evaluation. 394Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) Policies In the event that a student finds that an absence from a clinical rotation is unavoidable, they must complete an absence notification form that will be sent to the clinical course director and the Director of Medical Student Education and Student Affairs. Students must also notify their clinical supervisors by email. If a student is ill or has a personal emergency, they are responsible for completing an absence notification form as soon as possible. If the absence extends beyond two consecutive days, the Director of Medical Student Education and the Office of Student Affairs will be notified. It is recognized that a student may, on a rare basis, desire to be excused from clinical activities for professional or significant personal events. Travel prior to or following observed university holidays and breaks that occurs outside of the officially designated times/dates on the MD Program Academic Calendar does not constitute a significant personal event or unavoidable absence. For all students on clinical rotations, the Clinical Curriculum Committee has agreed upon the following limitations on the maximum number of days of absences (both planned and unplanned) from clinical rotations. Type of Course MD Students MSTP Students and Interviewing Fourth-Year MD Students* 2-week elective 1 day 1 day 3-week clerkship 1 day 1 day 4-week elective 3 days 5 days 4-week clerkship 3 days 3 days 5-week clerkship 3 days 3 days 8-week clerkship 4 days 4 days 9-week clerkship 4 days 4 days *Residency interviewing season is typically from mid-October through January. Any additional days off would require approval by the Associate Dean for Medical Student Education and the elective course director. If a student misses more than the maximum number of allowable days of absences for a given clinical rotation, the consequence rendered will be at the discretion of the clinical course director and the Associate Dean of Student Affairs or the Associate Dean of the Office of Medical Student Education. Failure of the student to notify the clinical course director of their absence after consideration of the particular circumstances of the absence will result in the filing of a professionalism concern form (PCF).Guidelines All non-clinical electives and the Capstone course may have separate attendance requirements and absence procedures. Please refer to the course syllabus for details. Students are encouraged to make up missed work on rotations in which this can result in meaningful learning and should discuss this option with the clinical course director. At the discretion of the clinical course director, any student who misses portions of the clinical experiences due to planned and/ or unplanned absences that exceed the maximum time may be required to utilize winter recess, spring break or free time at the end of the third-year clinical rotations to complete the 48 weeks of mandatory clinical rotations. A concerning trend of absences may result in a review of professional integrity by the Committee on the Academic and Professional Evaluation of Students (CAPES), at the discretion of the Dean of Student Affairs. MSTP students are encouraged to do the following: Meet with the Assistant Dean for Career Development early for assistance in residency planning. Consider returning to the MD program to allow for 18 to 24 months to complete MD training to allow flexibility for interviewing and USMLE exams. Discuss planned absences with clinical course directors early, prior to a clinical rotation, to better allow placement on a team to optimize the educational experience. We believe this guideline strikes an appropriate balance between increased flexibility for the MSTP students and assuring a meaningful educational experience on the core clinical rotations. The Washington University School of Medicine Absence Policy for Medical Students on Clinical Rotations was last approved by the Oversight Committee on Medical Student Education on May 3, 2021. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Oversight Committee on Medical Student Education. MD: Exam Expectations for Faculty Exams should be proctored by the course director or a designee appointed by the course director comfortable with proctoring and exam administration guidelines. NBME subject exams are proctored by or coordinated by the Office of Student Affairs. Administration should be fair to all students. If the faculty member answers a substantive question or clarifies an issue, the same should be communicated to all students, including those in separate rooms or at different times. 395Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) Reasonable adjustments should be offered to students who require special accommodations, including a separate testing room or additional time. Course directors are notified of these students through the associate dean for student affairs. If a student behaves inappropriately, the course director should notify the associate dean for student affairs immediately. All requirements of students should be communicated to all students prior to the start of the exam. MD: School of Medicine High- Stakes Exam Expectations for Students in All Phases of the Curriculum The term high-stakes exams is used to denote all summative assessments, which are those assessments that evaluate student learning against intended course outcomes at the conclusion of instruction. Within the preclinical curriculum, the term includes all events for which the activity type is listed as \"Exam.\" Within the clinical curriculum, the term includes NBME Shelf Exams. Students are required to take all examinations at the originally specified time. A student may be excused from this rule for extenuating circumstances at the discretion of the associate dean for student affairs (ADSA). Examples of extenuating circumstances include personal illness and personal or family emergency. Doctor appointments of a routine nature or personal obligations such as weddings, birthday celebrations, or other planned personal or family commitments are generally not considered to be extenuating circumstances for which students can be exempted from the regularly scheduled exam date. All makeup exam requests go through the ADSA. The ADSA then submits the approved request to the Office of Medical Student Education (OMSE), and the OMSE will then transfer and track the requests granted. Course directors should refer all makeup exam requests to the ADSA. Students who are unable to attend a scheduled examination should promptly contact the ADSA. Students should also notify the course director(s); in cases related to personal illness, students should also contact Student Health Services. The OMSE handles all exam rescheduling, and examinations will only be rescheduled after approval by the ADSA. The timing of the rescheduled examination will be determined by the OMSE in collaboration with the course director(s).Students are expected to be punctual and should be assembled in the designated exam area before the official start time of the exam. Tardiness will not be excused except in extenuating circumstances. For purposes of the exam, \"tardiness\" will be defined by the course director or exam proctor. The course director will set expectations and determine consequences for exam tardiness. Students are expected to place all personal items, including muted cell phones, in designated areas. Students are expected to follow all proctor instructions. Students must not share study materials, exchange information, or collaborate or communicate with others during the exam. After taking the exam, students must not share information about the exam with anyone who has not yet taken it. MD: Leave of Absence (LOA) Policy Return of students from involuntary leave of absence requires clearance of both the director of Student Health Services and the associate dean for student affairs. I.Voluntary LOA: A student may request a leave of absence for academic or personal reasons by submitting a statement in writing to the Office of Student Affairs. Such a statement should include indication of the beginning and anticipated ending dates and a brief statement of the reason (academic or personal). Requests for leaves of absence must be approved by the associate dean for student affairs. Leaves of absence shall be granted for no more than one year, but in unusual cases may be renewed by the Committee on the Academic and Professional Evaluation of Students (CAPES) for additional time after discussion with the associate dean for student affairs. Students requiring a personal leave of absence for medical reasons must submit a supporting letter from the director of Student Health Services. A written statement of medical clearance will be required before the student may return from such a leave. II.Involuntary LOA: If there is a reasonable basis for believing that the continued presence of the student on campus or in clinical rotations poses a substantial threat to the student, to patients, or to the rights of others to engage in their normal university functions and activities, the following procedures apply: A.The chancellor or his designate may impose an involuntary leave of absence when there is evidence that a student has committed an offense under these rules or the University's Judicial Code, and when there is evidence that the continued presence of the student on the university campus or as a participant in a clinical rotation poses a substantial threat to themselves, to patients, or to the rights of others to continue their normal university function and activities. 396Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) B.Imposition of the involuntary leave of absence may result in denial of access to the campus, prohibition of class attendance and/or prohibition of participation in clinical rotations. C.If an involuntary leave of absence is imposed, the suspending authority shall prepare a written notice of the imposition and shall have the notice mailed certified or personally presented to the student. The written notice shall include a brief statement of the reasons therefore and a brief statement of the procedures provided for resolving cases of involuntary leave of absence under these rules. D.The student shall be given an opportunity to appear personally before the suspending authority within five (5) business days from the date of service of the notice of imposition of the involuntary leave of absence. If the student asks to appear personally before the suspending authority, only the following issues shall be considered: 1.Whether the suspending authority's information concerning the student's conduct is reliable; and 2.Whether under all the circumstances, there is a reasonable basis for believing that the continued presence of the student on campus or in clinical rotations poses a substantial threat to the student, to patients, or to the rights of others to engage in their normal university functions and activities. E.Within one week of the date of imposition of the involuntary leave of absence, the suspending authority shall either file a statement of charges against the student with the University Judicial Board, and shall have the statement or charges served, by mail or personal service, upon the student and the dean of the school or college or director of the program in which the student is enrolled, or initiate proceedings under these rules to convene a Disciplinary Committee. F.A temporary suspension shall end 1.when rescinded by the suspending authority, or 2.upon the failure of the suspending authority to promptly file a statement of charges with the University Judicial Board or a Disciplinary Committee, or 3.when the case is heard and decided by the University Judicial Board or the Disciplinary Committee. III.LOA Impact on Financial Aid: Students receiving financial aid should be advised that at the end of sixty (60) days or more leave of absence, the grace period for loan repayment during a leave of absence may be exhausted. In such cases there will be an obligation for the student to start payments. According to the federal rules under which loans are made, the use of a grace period during a leave of absence willgenerally mean that the schedule for loan repayment may be changed. Students who are receiving financial assistance should consult with the Financial Aid Office to determine the implications of a leave of absence for their financial aid. IV.LOA Impact on Tuition: A student returning from a leave of absence of one year duration or less will maintain the same tuition rate. Students returning after more than one year leave of absence will assume the tuition rate of the class they are rejoining. Appeals of this policy should be submitted in writing to the registrar. Please refer to the Financial Information (p. 401) section on Registration, Payments, and Withdrawal & Refunds Policy and the effect of a leave of absence on tuition and other financially related matters. For additional information please review the Student Information for Leave of Absence or Withdrawal (PDF) (http:// bulletin.wustl.edu/medicine/policies/md-leave-of-absence/ Leave_of_Absence_Withdrawal_Handout_2018.pdf ). MD: Policy on Student Status and Benefits During Research Years or Leave of Absence MD/PhD Student status is maintained while in the research phase of the MD/PhD programs.

MD: United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Students who matriculated prior to 2014 and who anticipate practicing clinical medicine are required to take the USMLE Step 1 and 2 examinations. Beginning with the class matriculating in 2014, all students are required to take the USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 prior to graduation. The USMLE is designed to \"assess a physician's ability to apply knowledge, concepts, and principles, and to demonstrate fundamental patient-centered skills, that are important in health and disease and that constitute the basis of safe and effective patient care.\"* The USMLE represents a single uniform examination for medical licensure in the United States, and, as such, is a minimum requirement for obtaining a medical license. The USMLE consists of three separate examinations: \"Step 1 assesses whether you understand and can apply important concepts of the sciences basic to the practice of medicine, with special emphasis on principles and mechanisms underlying health, disease, and modes of therapy. Step 1 ensures mastery of not only the sciences that provide a foundation for the safe and competent practice of medicine in the present, but also the scientific principles required for maintenance of competence through lifelong learning.\" Step 1 is taken after completing the second year at Washington University School of Medicine.\"Step 2 assesses whether you can apply medical knowledge, skills, and understanding of clinical science essential for the provision of patient care under supervision and includes emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention. Step 2 ensures that due attention is devoted to principles of clinical sciences and basic patient- centered skills that provide the foundation for the safe and competent practice of medicine.\" Step 2 exams are taken after completing the third year but prior to graduation from Washington University School of Medicine. \"Step 3 assesses whether you can apply medical knowledge and understanding of biomedical and clinical science essential for the unsupervised practice of medicine, with emphasis on patient management in ambulatory settings. Step 3 provides a final assessment of physicians assuming independent responsibility for delivering general medical care.\" Step 3 is taken following graduation and during internship/residency training. Further information can be obtained from the USMLE Bulletin of Information (https://www.usmle.org/bulletin/) published by the National Board of Medical Examiners. This is available, along with application forms and additional information, on the USMLE website (http://www.usmle.org ). *The quoted material throughout this section from the USMLE website (https://www.usmle.org/ ). Non-Curricular-Related Policies MD: Advanced Standing Transfers Policy for Medical Students Background LCME Standard 10.7 calls upon accredited schools to ensure that any student accepted for transfer demonstrates characteristics comparable to the other students in the class that they will join. Further, the school must accept transfers into the final year only in rare and extraordinary circumstances. Washington University School of Medicine has historically offered a third-year advanced standing (transfer) program that conformed to the LCME standard. Curricular reform has led us to re-examine this policy. Unlike the Legacy curriculum, which had a 2+2 structure that mapped readily onto other schools' curricula, the Gateway Curriculum is both unique and integrated. A transfer student would not have an experience substantially equivalent to that of their classmates. Designing custom alternative programs for each transfer student would be impractical and contrary to the program's philosophy. The Gateway Curriculum involves 398Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) continuous benchmarking of progress against competencies and program objectives. A transfer student would not have this continuous benchmarking. It is therefore not possible to offer transfers into the Gateway Curriculum. Policies/Requirement Washington University School of Medicine does not accept advanced standing (transfer) students from other medical schools. Guidelines It is not possible to transfer into the MD degree program at Washington University, either as an MD-only candidate or as an MD-PhD. This policy does not preclude Washington University medical students from transferring internally into the Medical Scientist Training Program. The Washington University School of Medicine Advanced Standing Transfers Policy for Medical Students was last approved by the Academic Affairs Committee on May 13, 2021. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Academic Affairs Committee. MD: Non-University-Affiliated Speaker Compensation Background Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) recognizes the importance of having individuals from outside of the WUSM community contribute to the educational goals of students in the MD program. The following policies apply to the financial compensation of individuals who do not have formal ties to Washington University in St. Louis and who function as speakers to medical students in the core curriculum of the MD program. In keeping with element 9.1, WUSM ensures that all non-university- affiliated instructors are familiar with the relevant learning objectives of the course or clerkship and that they are prepared for their roles in teaching. Policies/Requirements All requests for external speakers should be presented for review by the Senior Manager in the Office of Medical Student Education at least 21 days prior to their inclusion in learning sessions. The Office of Medical Student Education may exercise discretion in accepting late requests made under rare extenuating circumstances. Speakers who require little to no advanced preparation for their involvement (e.g., someone sharing their lived experience as a patient) will be compensated $50 per session in addition to reimbursement for parking or public transportation.Speakers who will have a leadership role in an instructional session (e.g., via a lecture or facilitated discussion) that will require substantive advanced preparation of more than 5 hours will be compensated $200 per session in addition to reimbursement for parking or public transportation. For situations in which the requested speaker compensation exceeds the rates established above, requests should be submitted for review by the Office of Medical Student Education; final approval will be given by the Executive Director for Education Administration and Finance in the Office of Education Administration & Finance unit at least 60 days prior to the speaker engaging in any session-related activities. In all cases, a narrative explaining the need for a higher rate \u2014 along with supporting documentation demonstrating that an effort to negotiate the speaker's rates to remain within the WUSM policy parameters has occurred \u2014 must be submitted. For any guest speaker sessions to be recorded and any other artifacts captured (e.g., photos) and to be later made available through the WUSM Office of Medical Student Education, explicit permission from the guest speaker must be provided, with details on where these materials will be housed and how they will be used in the future. The Washington University School of Medicine Policy for Non- University-Affiliated Speaker Compensation was last approved by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Student Education on Sept. 13, 2021. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Student Education. MD: Policy on External Factors Background LCME Element 10.2 requires that the final responsibility for selecting medical students must reside with a formally constituted faculty committee and that the selection of individual medical students for admission is not influenced by any political or financial factors. This policy, together with the Policy on the Final Authority of the Admission Committee, is intended to clarify the role that external factors may play. Policy Persons or groups external to the Committee on Admissions may assist with the identification of applicants, but they do not have decision-making authority. The selection of individual students at WUSM must not be influenced by factors exogenous to the admissions process, such as political or financial factors. The Policy on External Factors was last approved by the Academic Affairs Committee on Aug. 12, 2021. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Academic Affairs Committee. 399Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) MD: Policy on the Final Authority of the Committee on Admissions Background LCME Element 10.2 requires that the \"final responsibility for accepting medical students\" rest with a formally constituted admission committee, with specified authority, composition, and rules of operation. Policy The Committee on Admissions (COA) has final authority for determining the acceptance of all candidates for the MD degree at Washington University School of Medicine. The COA is assembled by the Associate Dean for Admissions and is drawn from the faculty and staff of the School of Medicine, with the majority drawn from the full-time faculty. Final decisions for the acceptance of an applicant during the regular season (prior to May 1) are made by the Steering Committee, a committee of the whole at which all COA members have seat, voice, and vote. Five voting COA members must be present at Steering, and the majority of voting members present must be members of the faculty for a quorum to be reached at Steering. After May 1, during the waitlist phase, final decisions are made by the Leadership Subcommittee on behalf of the COA. The selection of individual medical students is not influenced by political or financial factors, in accordance with our policies on external factors and conflicts of interest. The Policy on the Final Authority of the Committee on Admissions was last approved by the Academic Affairs Committee on Aug. 12, 2021. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Academic Affairs Committee. MD: Policy on the Selection of Students Background LCME Element 10.3 calls upon the faculty to establish criteria for student selection and to develop and implement effective policies and procedures regarding medical student application, selection, and admission and to make available to all interested parties its criteria, standards, policies, and procedures. Policy The selection process that has been developed by the Committee on Admissions identifies applicants whose life experiences, personal attributes, academic achievement, and career goals align with the mission and vision of WUSM (https://medicine.wustl.edu/about/mission/ ) and the guidingprinciples of the Gateway Curriculum (https://sites.wustl.edu/ gatewaycurriculum/about/guiding-principles/ ). The purpose is to identify candidates who will contribute to the medical profession and who are most likely to enrich and benefit from our learning environment. Our process follows the AAMC principles of holistic review (https://students-residents.aamc.org/choosing- medical-career/holistic-review-medical-school-admissions/ ). Furthermore, the AAMC Core Competencies for Entering Medical Students (https://www.aamc.org/services/admissions- lifecycle/competencies-entering-medical-students/ ) are the overall dimensions on which students are evaluated. All of the committee's rubrics and forms have been linked to these Core Competencies. The Policy on the Selection of Students was last approved by the Academic Affairs Committee on Aug. 12, 2021. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Academic Affairs Committee. Resources The School of Medicine is fully dedicated to providing an outstanding learning environment in which students are supported in meeting their individual professional goals.

Such requests should initially be directed toward the course directors and thereafter to the associate dean for student affairs. Students who are repeating courses will be offered the opportunity for tutorial assistance. The Committee on the Academic and Professional Evaluation of Students (CAPES) ( p. 380) or the Competency Attainment Committee may also require it. There is no charge to the student for tutorial assistance. Tutoring Phase 1 Students: Tutoring for individual content areas is available, and it is offered either in small groups or one-on-one from teaching assistants or other graduate students. Interested students should contact the appropriate course lead or the Office of Medical Student Education (OMSE).

For questions about this resource, please contact the Office of Medical Student Education at omsecurriculum@wustl.edu .Financial Information for the School of Medicine This page presents financial information for the programs and degrees offered by the School of Medicine. Refer to the tabbed sections for specific financial information about individual programs. Medical Students Financial Assistance The ability to finance a medical education at Washington University does not influence the student selection process. As all students accepted for admission have proven scholastic ability, financial assistance is awarded to qualifying U.S. citizens and permanent residents solely on the basis of documented financial need that cannot be met by student and family resources. Students who consider themselves financially independent of their parents must arrange for loans to replace the amount of support parents are analyzed to have the potential to contribute. The School of Medicine's Office of Student Financial Planning (https://finaid.med.wustl.edu/ ) will assist students with making these arrangements. In responding to the Admissions Committee's offer of admission, an accepted student will be directed to the student financial aid portal, Net Partner (https://netpartnerstudent.wustl.edu/), to indicate what type of aid they are applying for. The Financial Aid Office acknowledges the student's intent and provides instructions for completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Everyone applying for financial aid must complete a FAFSA and designate Washington University School of Medicine, School Code #G24620, as a recipient. Medical school financial aid application documents and detailed instructions are made available after January 1. The financial aid application materials solicit information about the applicant and their parents, including a detailed description of resources and liabilities. If an applicant's parents are separated or divorced, the financial information is required from both biological parents, excluding the income and assets of their spouses, if remarried. If the applicant is married, similar information is required of the spouse. The school expects the applicant to complete and submit the financial aid documents within two weeks from the date the applicant receives them. Official copies of both biological parents' individual U.S. income tax returns and the applicant's official IRS transcripts complete the data required for financial aid consideration. While \"permanent residents\" of the United States are eligible for most federal financial aid programs, need-based financial aid from Washington University is only awarded if the applicant and both biological parents can provide official, audited documents with the same detailed information as provided on a U.S. income tax return. All information is held in strict confidence. 401Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) Financial aid awards are credited toward the payment of tuition and fees. If there is an excess of funds on a student's account after tuition and other charges, the Registrar's Office will issue a refund check. The loan portion of an award will be funded through the resources of the School of Medicine or through the Federal Direct Loan program. Financial aid awards are made for a given academic year. Beginning with the 2019-20 academic year, any need-based scholarship awarded will be fixed for all future years. Students may reapply for federal loans in succeeding years if they remain in good academic and personal standing. The committee holds that students receiving assistance have an obligation to notify the committee in writing if their financial situation changes, for example, through employment or the receipt of a scholarship not anticipated at the time the application was submitted. First- and second-year students are urged not to accept employment during the academic year. A number of fourth- year students find employment in hospitals within the Medical Center. The personnel office may provide assistance to students' spouses seeking employment. Tuition Stabilization Policy for Medical Students Background LCME standard 3.2 indicates that the medical program should offer sufficient opportunities, encouragement, and support for medical student participation in research and other scholarly activities. The proposed policy aligns with standard 3.2 and a student-centered learning environment. The School of Medicine encourages student research and participation in additional study outside of the traditional medical curriculum. Policies As of July 1, 2020, all matriculating students will benefit from a tuition stabilization plan, which provides that the tuition rate at matriculation will remain constant for up to 10 consecutive years. The stabilized rate will expire ten academic years after matriculation. Therefore, students whose medical education is interrupted for any reason for more than six years will be charged at the rate of the class they rejoin. Appeals of this policy should be submitted in writing to the Medical School Registrar prior to the 10-year limit and any required increase in tuition. Appeals will be considered on a case-by-case basis, with the ultimate decision resting with the Registrar/Assistant Dean for Academic Affairs. The Washington University School of Medicine Tuition Stabilization Policy for Medical Students was last approved by the Academic Affairs Committee on April 9, 2020. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Academic Affairs Committee.Standards for Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid Eligibility When a student is enrolled in the curriculum of the MD program, the following policy applies regarding standards for Satisfactory Academic Performance (SAP). Federal regulations require that students receiving Title IV financial aid maintain SAP. The minimum GPA requirements needed to maintain eligibility for Satisfactory Academic Progress are dictated by the specific program of study. In each case, per the requirements of 34 C.F.R. 668.34(a)(4(ii), the federal student aid program requires a minimum of a C average to maintain eligibility for aid, but an individual degree or certificate program may have a higher minimum GPA for federal Satisfactory Academic Progress. This policy presents the standards adopted by the Washington University School of Medicine and applies to all MD students. SAP is evaluated annually, at the end of each academic year. If a student is not maintaining progress, they will be notified by the Committee on Academic and Professional Evaluation of Students (CAPES) and the director of financial aid via their WUSM e-mail, and they will be ineligible, or \"suspended,\" for federal aid for future terms unless they appeal their status and it is approved by CAPES and the director of financial aid. An appeal must contain the extenuating circumstances surrounding the failure to meet SAP, such as illness, injury, or other circumstances beyond the student's control. In order to be compliant in maintaining SAP and thus eligible for federal financial aid, students must be satisfactorily progressing toward their academic objectives. Federal regulations require the following measurements for determining SAP: time frame and quantitative/qualitative requirements. Time Frame Requirement The maximum time frame of full-time enrollment for the completion of each program is as follows: Four-year MD program: 6 years Five-year MD program: 7.5 years Periods of non-enrollment are not counted in the measurement of satisfactory academic progress; however, all periods of attendance, regardless of whether or not the student received Title IV aid, are counted. This policy is applied in the context of each individual student's enrollment status in order to accommodate the student who does not enroll on a full-time basis. For example, if a student enrolls in a four-year program, the full-time student would meet the 150% maximum rule (as per Title IV guidelines) after six years of full-time enrollment, and the half-time student is expected to complete the program within 12 years. If a student vacillates 402Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) between full-time and half-time enrollment, that student would have a maximum time frame of between six and 12 years, and the maximum time frame for that student would be continuously adjusted. If a student reaches a point where they cannot complete their program within the 150% maximum, that student becomes ineligible for federal aid for all future semesters. Quantitative/Qualitative Requirement Academic requirements for the MD degree include the satisfactory completion of the curriculum designated by the faculty. The progress of each student working toward an MD degree is monitored carefully by the Committee on Academic and Professional Evaluation of Students (CAPES). Refer to the Assessing Academic Achievement (p. 380) section of this Bulletin for more information. A student failing to meet the standards of satisfactory progress as determined by CAPES shall be placed on financial aid suspension. The student will be eligible for aid when they achieve SAP, or the student may appeal. Students who choose to appeal must state the reasons for failing to meet SAP (e.g., injury/illness of the student, death in the family or other special circumstance) and what has changed in the student's situation so that they can now make SAP. If the student successfully appeals, the student will be placed on financial aid probation and may receive financial assistance for one term. At the conclusion of this period, the student must have achieved compliance with each standard or be progressing per their individual academic plan to receive additional aid. A student who does not achieve compliance with each standard by the conclusion of the probationary period is suspended from financial aid eligibility. The Office of Student Financial Aid must notify a student of implementation of probationary status and/or suspension. The Director of Student Financial Aid shall have primary responsibility for enforcement of this policy. The Office of Student Financial Planning shall ascertain at the time of each disbursement of funds and prior to certification of a financial aid application that the student is in compliance with the policy. Cost of Education For the first-year class matriculant, tuition and estimated expenses for the 2022-23 academic year are listed below. Students will benefit from a tuition stabilization plan, which provides that their annual tuition and fees of $69,250 will be constant for up to 10 consecutive years. The stabilized rate will expire 10 academic years after matriculation. The items listed below provide an estimate of the expenses for a single student in the 37-week first-year class. The total of these figures suggests a basic minimum budget of approximately $90,361. Allowances for entertainment, travel, clothing and other miscellaneous items must be added to this estimate.Tuition and fees (includes Student Health Services and Microscope Lending Plan): $69,250 Books and and personal: $2,550 Policy for International Students The admission decision at Washington University School of Medicine is based on academic and personal merit and not on the ability of the student to pay the costs of education. However, individuals who are not citizens of the United States of America or who do not hold U.S. Permanent Resident Visa status, including DACA students, are not eligible for financial aid due to regulations covering many programs used by the school to fund financial assistance. Therefore, in order for the school to complete the required documents which are necessary for issuance of a visa, the student must document, by a date and in a manner designated by the school, that the necessary amount of funds, as established by the school, is available to pay the costs of education (tuition and living expenses) for the anticipated period of enrollment, normally four years. Documentation of the required amount of financial resources may be by a letter of credit or by deposit of funds in an escrow account with a bank designated by the school.

Registration, Payments, and Withdrawal and Refunds Policy The university billing system provides a central financial account against which most student expenses incurred at the university will be posted, including but not limited to tuition, housing charges, parking and library fines. This policy, when referring to tuition and other charges, includes any and all charges posted to this account. All payments of tuition and other university charges are due and payable on the dates specified in the published calendars of the programs in the School of Medicine. Failure of a student to register when required, and pay tuition and other charges incurred on or before the date specified in the published calendar, may result in a late fee of $50 to be added to the amount due. The late fee may be imposed seven days after the due date if full payment has not been received. Tuition and other charges are usually payable twice a year, at the start of the academic year, and again at the middle of the academic year, as listed on the schedule on the academic calendar. In addition to the $50 late fee, any payment due from the student and not paid by the specified date will accrue interest at the current market rate in effect on the first business day of the month in which the payment is due. This fee will be imposed on any accounts not paid in full within 30 days of the due date. Any amount not paid when due (plus accrued interest thereon) must be paid in full within three months of the due date to avoid potential suspension from classes, unless a deferred payment is approved by the registrar due to extenuating circumstances. 406Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) If a student fails to make payments within three months of the original due date, the school will not release the student's academic record, grade reports or transcript, pending settlement of the unpaid account. A student who has not satisfied all of their delinquent financial obligations to Washington University (e.g., tuition, university housing, parking) one month before the end of the academic year will not be allowed to progress to the next academic year, nor can they be issued a diploma. Federal financial aid funds for the next academic year cannot be disbursed until all prior year balances are paid in full. Students who rely on financial aid funds to meet their obligations should submit their applications for processing according to application deadlines published by the Office of Student Financial Planning. Deadlines allow for receipt of financial aid funds by payment due dates if applications are filed by the deadline. The Office of Student Financial Planning will assist students with loan applications and financial planning upon request. A student who withdraws or takes a leave of absence from the school will receive a pro rata refund of tuition and appropriate fees. The refund will be based on the ratio of the class days enrolled (from the first day of classes to the termination date) to the total number of class days in the term for which tuition and fees were paid. It is understood that the date on which a student formally notifies the Registrar's Office in writing of the decision to withdraw or take a leave of absence from the School of Medicine shall be regarded as the termination date, with no retroactive clause to be accepted. A prospective date will be accepted, however. If tuition and fees were paid entirely or in part by financial aid from the school, the refund will be applied first to the total repayment of the accounts from which financial aid was drawn, with any remaining refund balance given to the student. Financial aid received in excess of the costs of tuition and fees must be refunded by the student to the school on the same pro rata basis as calculated for the tuition refund outlined above, per \"Return of Title IV\" federal guidelines. Any questions about these policies may be directed to either the Office of the Registrar or Student Financial Planning. Merit-Based Scholarships In 1978, the School of Medicine established a scholarship program that based selection on merit rather than financial need. As one of the first merit scholarship programs for medical students, the Distinguished Student Scholarship Program has recognized and rewarded academic excellence and personal achievement for 33 years. And, to honor outstanding alumni of Washington University, the Medical Center Alumni Association created in 1989 the Distinguished Alumni Scholarship Program. In 1998, the Barnes-Jewish Hospital Medical Staff Associationcommitted to funding one full-tuition, four-year scholarship to a student in each entering class. Beginning with the 2002-03 academic year, one additional \"named\" scholarship was made available through the generosity of a donor. Most merit-based scholarships are awarded to students in the first-year class and are subject to annual renewal. Recipients of these scholarships are expected to maintain academic excellence. If a scholarship is not renewed, the student may file for financial aid from the school. For scholarship recipients who document financial need above the full-tuition scholarship, additional funds are available to provide support up to the total cost of education. Scholarship recipients may not concurrently participate in the school's Medical Scientist Training Program, the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship Program, or the National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program. Now known collectively as the Distinguished Scholars Program, its aim is to attract and enroll the most outstanding students in the School of Medicine, thus enriching the scholarly environment and broadening the scope of learning for all students. Scholarship recipients are selected on intelligence, character, personal accomplishments and goals, motivation for medicine, aptitude for science, leadership potential, communication skills and diversity of life experience. Scholarships awarded under this program include the Barnes-Jewish Hospital Scholars, Danforth Scholars in Medicine, Distinguished Alumni Scholars (DAS), Distinguished Faculty Scholars (DFS), and Distinguished Student Scholars (DSS). Barnes-Jewish Hospital Medical Staff Association Scholarship One full-tuition, four-year scholarship will be awarded to a student in each entering class beginning in 1999. Selection of the Barnes-Jewish Hospital Medical Staff Association Scholar is the same as for the Distinguished Student Scholarship. Danforth Scholars in Medicine Named in honor of William H. and Elizabeth Gray Danforth, the chancellor and first lady of the university from 1971 to 1995, the Danforth Scholars Program is a tribute to their legacy of exemplary leadership and service. Distinguished Alumni Scholarships Up to four full-tuition scholarships are awarded annually to members of the entering first-year class. The application procedure and selection process are the same as for the Distinguished Student Scholarships. Since 1989, Distinguished Alumni Scholarships have been named in honor of the following individuals: 407Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) Leonard Bacharier, MD Thomas Bailey, MD Thomas Baranski, MD, PhD Walter F.

General Information Registration, Payments, and Withdrawal & Refunds Policy The university billing system provides a central financial account against which most student expenses incurred at the university will be posted, including but not limited to tuition, housing charges, parking and library fines. This policy, when referring to tuition and other charges, includes any and all charges posted to this account. All payments of tuition and other university charges are due and payable on the dates specified in the published calendars of the programs in the School of Medicine. Failure of a student to register when required, and pay tuition and other charges incurred on or before the date specified in the published calendar, may result in a late fee of $50 to be added to the amount due. The late fee may be imposed seven days after the due date if full payment has not been received. Tuition and other charges are usually payable twice a year, at the start of the academic year, and again at the middle of the academic year, as listed on the schedule on the academic calendar. In addition to the $50 late fee, any payment due from the student and not paid by the specified date will accrue interest at the current market rate in effect on the first business day of the month in which the payment is due. This fee will be imposed on any accounts not paid in full within 30 days of the due date. Any amount not paid when due (plus accrued interest thereon) must be paid in full within three months of the due date to avoid potential suspension from classes, unless a deferred payment is approved by the registrar due to extenuating circumstances. If a student fails to make payments within three months of the original due date, the school will not release the student's academic record, grade reports or transcript, pending settlement of the unpaid account. A student who has not satisfied all of their delinquent financial obligations to Washington University (e.g., tuition, university housing, parking) one month before the end of the academic year will not be allowed to progress to the next academic year, nor can they be issued a diploma. 416Bulletin 2022-23 Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (08/12/22) Federal financial aid funds for the next academic year cannot be disbursed until all prior year balances are paid in full. Students who rely on financial aid funds to meet their obligations should submit their applications for processing according to application deadlines published by the Office of Student Financial Planning. Deadlines allow for receipt of financial aid funds by payment due dates if applications are filed by the deadline. The Office of Student Financial Planning will assist students with loan applications and financial planning upon request. A student who withdraws or takes a leave of absence from the school will receive a pro rata refund of tuition and appropriate fees. The refund will be based on the ratio of the class days enrolled (from the first day of classes to the termination date) to the total number of class days in the term for which tuition and fees were paid. It is understood that the date on which a student formally notifies the Registrar's Office in writing of the decision to withdraw or take a leave of absence from the School of Medicine shall be regarded as the termination date, with no retroactive clause to be accepted. A prospective date will be accepted, however. If tuition and fees were paid entirely or in part by financial aid from the school, the refund will be applied first to the total repayment of the accounts from which financial aid was drawn, with any remaining refund balance given to the student. Financial aid received in excess of the costs of tuition and fees must be refunded by the student to the school on the same pro rata basis as calculated for the tuition refund outlined above, per \"Return of Title IV\" federal guidelines. Any questions about these policies may be directed to either the Office of the Registrar or Student Financial Planning. Standards for Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid Eligibility All Non-MD Students: The minimum GPA requirements needed to maintain eligibility for Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) are are dictated by the specific program of study. In each case, per the requirements of 34 C.F.R. 668.34(a)(4(ii), the federal student aid program requires a minimum of a C average to maintain eligibility for aid, but an individual degree or certificate program may have a higher minimum GPA for federal Satisfactory Academic Progress. If a student's grades fall below the required GPA for the program when the SAP review is performed, the student is not considered to be maintaining SAP. Students enrolled in various School of Medicine degree programs should refer to the specific policies of their primary program: Applied Health Behavior Research (https://crtc.wustl.edu/programs/degrees/ahbr/), Audiology and Communication Sciences (https://pacs.wustl.edu/), Biology and Biomedical Sciences ( p. 418), Biomedical Engineering (p. 418), Biostatistics (https://biostatistics.wustl.edu), Clinical Investigation (https://crtc.wustl.edu/programs/ and Population Health Sciences (http://www.mphs.wustl.edu/ ). SAP is evaluated at the end of each semester or term. To be considered to be maintaining SAP and thus be eligible for federal financial aid, a student must maintain the program's minimum program requirements for cumulative GPA and pace (i.e., credit earned for at least 67% of the credits attempted). The degree must also be completed within the maximum time frame allowed for the program (i.e., no more than 150% of the credits required). For example, if the program requires 120 credits to complete, the student must be able to complete the program by attempting no more than 180 credits. To determine how many credits are required to complete the program, the student should consult the school's Bulletin. If the student cannot complete the program without attempting more than 150% of the credits required, the student is not considered to be maintaining SAP. Students who fail to meet SAP requirements after one semester will be placed on a \"warning.\" Students on a warning will continue to be eligible to receive aid for the following semester or term. Students not meeting SAP at the end of the warning will be notified of their loss of aid eligibility by the Office of Student Financial Planning via their Washington University e-mail address. A student who becomes ineligible for aid by failure to meet SAP requirements may also appeal to reestablish aid eligibility. The student's appeal will be reviewed by the school's dean's office and the Office of Student Financial Planning. An appeal must contain the extenuating circumstances surrounding the failure to meet SAP, such as illness, injury, or other circumstances beyond the student's control.

The refund will be based on the ratio of the class days enrolled (from the first day of classes to the termination date) to the total number of class days in the term for which tuition and fees were paid. It is understood that the date on which a student formally notifies the Registrar's Office in writing of the decision to withdraw or take a leave of absence from the School of Medicine shall be regarded as the termination date, with no retroactive clause to be accepted. A prospective date will be accepted, however. If tuition and fees were paid entirely or in part by financial aid from the school, the refund will be applied first to the total repayment of the accounts from which financial aid was drawn, with any remaining refund balance given to the student. Financial aid received in excess of the costs of tuition and fees must be refunded by the student to the school on the same pro rata basis as calculated for the tuition refund outlined above, per \"Return of Title IV\" federal guidelines. Any questions about these policies may be directed to either the Office of the Registrar or Financial Aid.Program Information Doctor of Medicine and Doctor of Philosophy: MD/PhD (MSTP) All MSTP students receive financial support in the form of a stipend (currently $34,500 per year), health coverage, disability and life insurance, and full tuition remission for both the MD and PhD phases of training.
