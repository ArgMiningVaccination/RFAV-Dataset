It's the body's way of trying to heal itself. Unfortunately, sometimes the pain is difficult to bear. While there are plenty of common over-the-counter (OTC) medications, such as aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen that will get rid of painful symptoms, they may upset the stomach. Worse, long-term use of these drugs can cause serious gastrointestinal issues like bleeding ulcers. Fortunately, there are natural alternatives. It starts with the arachidonic acid cascade of inflammation. Arachidonic acid (ARA) is an omega-6 fatty acid that is produced from linoleic acid, an essential fatty acid. When there is too much of it, the body produces a variety of enzymes - COX-1, COX-2, and 5-LOX - to break it down. Unfortunately, these enzymes can cause some serious side effects. Over expression of COX-1 may cause blood clots, leading to heart attacks and strokes. COX-2 and 5-LOX produce compounds involved in chronic inflammation, destroying joints, tissues, causing pain, and setting the stage for degenerative disease.1 But there are a number of natural compounds that inhibit these pathways of inflammation and help reduce inflammation from oxidative stress through their antioxidant action. Some of nature's most effective pain relievers and anti-inflammatory compounds are found in hops alpha acids, turmeric's curcumins, white willow, ginger, and rosemary. The bitter element in beer, hops alpha acid extracts have been shown to inhibit inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), prostaglandin E2, and other key enzymatic COX-2 pathway substances in the management of pain caused by inflammation.2 In a pilot study comparing it to 400 mg of ibuprofen over nine hours, results suggest that alpha acids from hops may represent a natural alternative for minor pain and inflammation, possibly providing important long-term safety advantages over OTC pain relievers.3 Curcumin in the Indian herb turmeric, is a powerful COX-2 inhibitor; it also blocks 5-LOX and other inflammatory factors.4 Furthermore, its antioxidant activity neutralizes both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen oxygen species (NOS) preventing these free radicals from creating inflammation.5 The bark of this ancient botanical, used in Traditional Chinese Medicine since 500 A.D., contains salicin, which was later purified to salicylic acid and then synthesized into acetylsalicylic acid. Acetylsalicylic acid is what constitutes aspirin. Aspirin is often used to treat pain and fever, but the drug is notorious for causing pain and damage to the stomach mucosal lining and is not recommended in conjunction with blood-thinning medications. The salicin in white willow alone is not enough to reduce pain or inflammation; however, in conjunction with antioxidant polyphenol and flavonoid compounds, the bark's compounds were found to be effective for back pain without stomach distress.6 7 This herb contains many compounds, most notably gingerols, that exhibit potent antioxidant activity. Ginger has a long history of use in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicines for inflammatory disease caused by oxidative stress.8 Rosemary contains powerful antioxidant compounds, which inhibit the iNOS enzyme as well as scavenging the oxidative activity of other free radicals.9 A fatty acid-like substance that naturally occurs in trace amounts in foods and is produced in all bodily tissues, including the central nervous system. It is believed to be produced in response to injury or inflammation as a protective mechanism, although production is not believed to be able to keep up with chronic inflammation or pain that may exhaust PEA levels.10 PEA has been studied for over 50 years and research has found that it works through several mechanisms to reduce inflammation and pain.11 12 In human clinical trials, PEA has been shown to reduce pain associated with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthritis, pelvic pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, sciatic pain, and more.13 14 15 16 17 Standard doses range from 600 to 1,200 mg per day.18 Next time you experience minor aches and pains from inflammation, tap Mother Nature's medicine cabinet for natural relief.
