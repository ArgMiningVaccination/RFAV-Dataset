VALUABLES AND PERSONAL ITEMS Please be aware that the hospital cannot be responsible for your personal belongings and/or valuables. Please send home all belongings that are not absolutely necessary to your hospital stay. This includes clothes, large amounts of cash, credit cards, jewelry, and special keepsakes. If this is not possible, please ask your nurse about storing your valuables in the hospital safe or Security office. If you are scheduled for surgery, you will be asked to remove all jewelry including your wedding band. This is for your personal safety. Other Tips for Your Personal Belongings Due to limited storage space, please keep personal clothing and possessions to a minimum. Eyeglasses, contact lenses, dentures, hearing aids, and other prosthetic devices may be kept with you. Protect them by placing them in a safe place (your bedside table drawer) so they are not accidentally discarded. Make sure your name is on your denture cup or ask your nurse for an easily identifiable denture holder. Never leave dentures or hearing aids on a food tray or on your bed. FORMS AND INSURANCE You will be asked to sign consent forms that allow our qualified staff to provide treatment or perform necessary surgical procedures. It is important you understand your treatment plan and the procedures your doctor will be using. If you are under 18, your parent or legal guardian must sign these forms. 4If you subscribe to a health insurance plan, please submit any health insurance cards at the time of admission. No patient will be refused emergency services due to an inability to pay. For information about billing and financial support, see Page 16 in your St. Peter's Health Partners Patient Handbook. PATIENT INFORMATION St. Peter's Health Partners obeys all federal and state laws to protect patient health information. Information is shared only with health professionals, as needed, or other agencies, as required by law. Patients must decide if they want their presence in the hospital and their room number to be given out to anyone who calls the hospital switchboard or the Patient Information department. Unless you \"opt out,\" persons may learn your room and phone number, as well as your visiting hours, by calling the hospital's Patient Information department at (518) 525-1571. (If you \"opt out\" of providing the information, it will mean that not even family and friends can learn about your status or location.) Any other personal information must come from your doctor and is only made available to members of the immediate family chosen by you. You may ask for copies of your records. To get an authorization for release of medical records, contact your nurse or Medical Records at (518) 525-1212. Patient Portals A patient portal is a secure online website that gives patients convenient, 24-hour access to personal health information from anywhere with an Internet connection. St. Peter's Health Partners supports two patient portals - Hixny and the St. Peter's Health Partners Patient Portal. Hixny Hixny is a secure, electronic service for exchanging health information among hospitals and doctors in the Capital Region. This service allows your doctor to view and share information like medication history, allergies, and test results. It also lets doctors write prescriptions online and send them to your pharmacy.5By law, Hixny uses the most advanced security to protect your privacy. Access to your information will be limited to doctors treating you, and Hixny tracks every person who accesses information. This service makes it more efficient to get the information that is already being shared via telephone, faxes, and mail. Hixny includes 17 upstate counties: Albany, Clinton, Columbia, Essex, Franklin, Fulton, Greene, Hamilton, Montgomery, Otsego, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie, St. Lawrence, Warren, and Washington. To participate, all you need to do is sign the Hixny consent form. If you change your mind, ask for another Hixny consent form to change your decision. To view the information in your Hixny health record, you can sign up for Hixny for You. Visit www.hixny.org for more information. St. Peter's Health Partners Patient Portal St. Peter's Health Partners' patient portal is an online tool that enables you to view your own health information. Our portal is secure and portable - you can access your reports from the comfort of your own home computer or tablet. A patient portal provides you with 24/7 online access to your health information, whenever and wherever you need it. With our patient portal, you are better informed about your health and are able to be an active partner with your health care team. To learn more about our patient portal, visit www.sphp.com/forpatients. Identification Bracelet For your safety: When you are admitted, an identification (ID) bracelet with your name and patient number will be placed on your wrist. Wear your hospital ID bracelet at all times. Make sure the information on it is correct. Ask for a new one if it comes off. Make sure staff always checks your ID bracelet, and asks your name and date of birth before any test, procedure or giving medication.6WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT DURING YOUR STAY We demonstrate our core values by providing high-quality, compassionate care to you during your stay. You can expect: We will talk with you and your family in a way that acknowledges your needs. We will introduce who we are and explain our role in providing your care, while keeping you comfortable and explaining what you can expect. We will communicate your progress and ask if you need anything before we leave your side. We will regularly check on you to ensure we are meeting your needs. We will ask you key questions about your pain, bathroom needs, comfort, and help keep your necessities in reach. (This process is also known as hourly rounding.) Information on who your caregivers are will be posted and updated on a board in your room to help you with your stay and recovery. While you are here, if you have any concerns about your care, please let your nurse or nurse manager know immediately. We want your stay here to be as comfortable as possible. YOUR ROOM For your comfort, we make every effort to honor specific room requests. However, please understand there are times where we may be unable to fulfill your request. This can happen if your admission is an emergency, if the room you request is unavailable or if the room is specifically assigned to a medical or surgical specialty. We will be happy to transfer you when a room of your choosing becomes available. WHILE YOU ARE HERE 7PLANNING YOUR CARE FROM ARRIVAL TO DISCHARGE Soon after you are admitted, a clinical care coordinator (C 3) will begin to make regular visits with you to plan for your needs while you are in the hospital and after you leave. The C 3 is a registered nurse who works closely with the members of your health care team (including your primary care provider) to coordinate your care beyond your hospital stay. Your C3 or a social worker is available to address other concerns you may have, including: Legal and financial problems Coping and bereavement issues Behavioral and mental health counseling Crisis intervention C3s encourage and welcome the active participation of you and your family members in decision-making about your health care. Your C 3 is committed to helping you maintain the quality care you need, for as long as you need it. HOW TO BE INVOLVED IN YOUR TREATMENT While you are a patient, we encourage you to take an active role in your health care. The Partnership for Clear Health Communication has established the \"Ask Me 3\" program, a simple set of questions that you should ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist at every visit. The questions are: What is my main problem? What do I need to do? Why is it important for me to do this? We encourage you to ask questions and be sure you understand the answers. If you do not understand the answers, ask your health care provider to explain the information again. Your providers want to help you understand your medical conditions, test results, medications, treatment instructions, and patient safety issues.8Your Safety We encourage all of our patients to take an active role in the prevention of infections and injuries. Important ways to do this can be found in the St. Peter's Health Partners Patient Handbook. To learn more about: Preventing infection, see Page 9. Preventing falls, see Page 10. Fire/emergency drills, surgery and medication safety, see Page 11. Remember to ask everyone (doctors, nurses, staff, visitors) who enters your room if they cleaned their hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. Ask your health care team if devices, such as urinary catheters and central venous catheters, are still necessary each day. By partnering with your Patient Safety Team at St. Peter's Hospital, you can help lessen the risk of health care-associated infections and injuries. Your Comfort Comfort and relief are important aspects of your care and treatment. We are committed to reducing your pain whenever possible and addressing your pain-control needs. To learn more, see Page 8 in the St. Peter's Health Partners Patient Handbook. Video Education St. Peter's Health Partners provides free educational videos for patients to view. These videos cover a wide range of topics, from diseases and conditions to medical procedures and general safety. To find out more information about how to access videos, ask your nurse. Select a Caregiver Partner We strongly recommend that the patient and/or family members choose a caregiver partner. This person acts as the designated spokesperson for the patient during their hospital stay. The caregiver partner can also update other family members and friends on the patient's condition.9SPIRITUAL CARE AND OTHER HEALING RESOURCES Spiritual care staff are an important part of the interdisciplinary health care team. Chaplains and other spiritual care staff are available to patients, family and friends of all faith traditions seven days a week, 24 hours a day. Our staff will visit and counsel patients, as well as provide opportunities for prayer, sacrament and ritual. To receive care from a chaplain or visit the hospital chapel, ask your nurse. Patients are invited to notify the spiritual leaders of their own faith communities of their hospitalization. These persons are welcome visitors at our hospitals. Chapel Services at St. Peter's Hospital Roman Catholic Mass is celebrated on Sundays at 10:30 am, and Monday through Saturday at 12 pm in the Chapel of Our Lady of Perpetual Help. The chapel is located on the ground floor. Patients and their families are invited to attend. This celebration of Mass is broadcast on Channel 67 of your in-room TV. Holistic and Integrative Therapy Holistic therapies are alternative healing methods that work to re-energize and rebalance your body. They also address underlying causes of illness, recognizing that thoughts, feelings, and spiritual beliefs play an important role in both illness and recovery. These therapies can be integrated with any traditional medical treatment. Benefits include pain relief, stronger immunity, reduced stress and anxiety, faster recovery from surgery, and increased relaxation. If you are interested in receiving these therapies during your hospital stay, please contact (518) 525-1174.10Palliative Care for the Seriously Ill Palliative care provides relief from pain and other symptoms often associated with serious illness. A team of doctors, nurses, and other specialists work with a patient's other doctors to provide an extra layer of support. The goal is to improve quality of life for both the patient and the family. Palliative care is appropriate at any age and at any stage of an illness, and can be provided along with curative treatment. For more information, ask your doctor or any member of your health care team. Ethics Consultation Service Sometimes patients, their families, and their health care team face difficult ethical issues regarding treatment decisions. The St. Peter's Health Partners Ethics Consultation Service has individuals trained in ethical decision-making who can discuss options for care, explain choices, offer guidance, and work with you and your health care team to resolve disagreements. This service is provided by each St. Peter's Health Partners hospital. To reach this service at your hospital, call (518) 525-1602. Institutional Review Board (IRB) The St. Peter's Health Partners' IRB is in place to protect the rights and welfare of persons participating in clinical research trials. It is a board of local doctors, scientific members, community members and non-scientific members. This board reviews, provides oversight and approves or disapproves local human subject research based on medical ethics, and state and federal rules and guidelines. Patients who are already enrolled in a clinical research trial should inform their doctor and nurse. Patients interested in participating in clinical research should speak with their doctor.11GUIDELINES FOR VISITING PATIENTS General visitation hours are 5 am to 9 pm. A designated support person, chosen by the patient, will be allowed 24/7 visitation access. If the support person plans to stay or visit between 9 pm and 5 am, he/she needs to check in at the nurses' station to receive a visitor's badge. The nursing staff has the authority to limit visitation based on a patient's care needs. All visitors should be free of infection or illness during visitation. Persons who do not feel well or have experienced certain symptoms within the last 48 hours should not visit the hospital. These symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat, skin rash, vomiting or diarrhea. All visitors should wash their hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub when entering and exiting a patient's room. Visitors are encouraged to be respectful of all of our patients' needs for rest and privacy. While family and friends are welcome, it is preferred that only two visitors enter a patient's room at one time. (The maximum number is four visitors at one time, and this is at the discretion of the patient and nursing staff.) Patient information is confidential and should not be discussed in public areas. Visiting Critical Care Areas Special guidelines must be followed when visiting patients in critical care areas. It is very important for guests to check in with the staff in these areas regarding the policy specific to the unit. Critical care areas include: the Emergency Department (ED), Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit (CVICU), Progressive Care Unit (PCU), Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), and the Coronary Care Unit (CCU).12Visitation by Children We encourage visits by children to be coordinated with the patient's health care team. Children age 12 and younger must be accompanied by an adult at all times when visiting St. Peter's Hospital. In critical care areas, we do not permit visitation from children under the age of 12. This is for the protection of patients and children. Special Circumstances Visitation guidelines for children and/or adults may change during special circumstances such as periods of flu prevalence or other infectious disease and/or New York State Department of Health alerts for visitation. General Safety Our goal is to promote a healing environment for our patients and staff. Violence, foul language or abusive behavior are not acceptable. Verbal threats or acts of violence will not be tolerated and may result in removal from this facility and/or prosecution. 13PATIENT EXPERIENCE If you have a concern, problem or complaint that has not been resolved through your nurses and doctors, you can call Patient Experience at (518) 525-1192 or email PatientExperience@sphp.com .
