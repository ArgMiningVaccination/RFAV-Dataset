But our scientists across the UK are pushing boundaries and taking steps to build a future where diabetes can do no harm. Our scientists are busy with exciting developments. Here, we take a look at the life-changing research taking place both for [type 1](/type-1-diabetes) and [type 2](/type-2-diabetes) diabetes. Is there a cure for type 2 diabetes? There's no cure yet, but our scientists are working on a ground-breaking [weight management study](#direct), to help people put their type 2 diabetes into [remission](/guide-to-diabetes/managing-your-diabetes/treating-your-diabetes/type2-diabetes-remission). Remission is when blood glucose (or blood sugar) levels are in a normal range again. This doesn't mean [diabetes](/diabetes-the-basics) has gone for good. It's still really important for people in remission to get regular healthcare checks. But being in remission can be life changing. Our ground-breaking study is called [DiRECT](/research/research-round-up/research-spotlight/research-spotlight-low-calorie-liquid-diet), short for Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial, and it could completely change the way type 2 diabetes is treated in the future. [Latest on our low-calorie DiRECT study](/research/research-round-up/research-spotlight/research-spotlight-low-calorie-liquid-diet) Our animation explains how remission works for people on our DiRECT weight management programme. Is there a cure for type 1 diabetes? In [type 1 diabetes](/type-1-diabetes), insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas are destroyed by the immune system. This means you can't make the [insulin](/guide-to-diabetes/managing-your-diabetes/treating-your-diabetes/insulin) you need to live. To stop type 1 diabetes we need to disrupt the immune system's attack on beta cells. And our scientists are working on it. They're aiming to develop and test treatments - called [immunotherapies](/research/research-round-up/research-spotlight/research-spotlight-a-vaccine-for-type-1-diabetes) - that target the immune system to stop it destroying beta cells. And with an incredible and unprecedented \u00a350 million investment from the Steve Morgan Foundation, the [ Type 1 Diabetes Grand Challenge](/research/our-research-projects/type-1-diabetes-grand-challenge) is funding game-changing type 1 diabetes research that will pave the way to the development of new treatments and a cure More research needed But our scientists across the UK aren't finished. And it's only with your help that we can push ahead with ground-breaking research to find a cure. Will you [donate today](https://donate.diabetes.org.uk/donate/) and help us lead "}
