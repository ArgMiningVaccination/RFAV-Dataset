Turning the tide of the pandemic in the near term will be challenging , requiring voluntary social distancing on the part o f households and the imposition of a variety of pande mic management measures by governments. The widespread deployment of effective vaccines will play a key ro le in halting the pandemic's progression, and is also exp ected to strengthen economic activity by raising confidence a nd improving financial market conditions. This box pres ents four scenarios to illustrate the implications of al ternative pandemic outcomes on the global economy in 2021-22 (figure B1.4.1). These scenarios differ in their assu mptions on the evolution of COVID-19 caseloads, vaccine deployment, voluntary social distancing by household s, the stringency of pandemic-control policies imposed by governments, and financial market stress. The baseline scenario assumes that voluntary and mandatory pandemic control measures are diligently maintained over the next several quarters until aft er widespread vaccination becomes available. From its re cent increases in several major economies, the daily num ber of infections is assumed to decline in the first half of 2021 in most countries. In advanced economies and major EMDEs, vaccination campaigns proceed in early in 2021 and reach widespread coverage in the second half of 2021; this vaccination process would be delayed by two to f our quarters in other EMDEs and LICs partly due to logi stical impediments. Activity is expected to improve as the pandemic abates, vaccines are rolled out, and financ ial conditions remain benign, supported by exceptionally accommodative monetary policy. The downside scenario assumes a persistently higher level of new cases in many regions throughout the forecas t horizon. In advanced economies and major EMDEs, the vaccination proceeds at a much slower pace than und er the baseline\u2014with an additional delay of two to four quar ters in other EMDEs and LICs\u2014and is limited by a reluctan ce of a sizeable share of the population to be immunize d. Activity would remain depressed as authorities stru ggle to contain the pandemic, while financial conditions wo uld deteriorate markedly. The severe downside scenario extends the downside scenario by exploring the possibility that authoriti es cannot contain widespread financial stress caused by a sharp rise in risk aversion after disappointing pan demic developments and widespread bankruptcies. Amid heightened financial vulnerabilities, financial cris es would erupt in several countries. In contrast, the upside scenario assumes more effective management of the pandemic, coupled with the rapid deployment of highly effective vaccines. This would trigger a faster easing of social distancing and a stronger recovery in activity. Methodology . 2#he global growth scenarios are developed using a combination of models and assumptions. a A Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model is used t o evaluate the impact of alternative vaccine assumpti ons on the evolution of the pandemic. Correlations based on cross-country regressions are used to project forwa rd the stringency of pandemic-control policies conditional on caseloads. Regression estimates are then used to ma p the impact of voluntary social distancing\u2014proxied by projected caseloads\u2014and involuntary social distanci ng on private consumption. 2#hese consumption shocks, which BOX 1.4 Global growth scenarios Note: This box was prepared by Justin-Damien Gu\u00e9net te under the supervision of Carlos Arteta, om Alain Kabundi, Hideaki Matsuoka, and uncertain evolution of the pandemic, inf luenced in part by government actions, social behav ior, and vaccine-related developments, will play a critical role in shaping the global recovery's strength and durability. This box describes possible global growth outcomes under different pandemic assumption s. In the baseline scenario, social distancing and a gradual vaccination process allow policy makers to make significant inr oads containing the pandemic. In a downside scenari o, insufficient pandemic control efforts accompanied by delayed vaccination leads to persistently higher infection levels and a materially worse growth out- come. In a severe downside scenario, these disappoi nting epidemiological developments combine with a s harp increase in risk aversion to trigger financial crises in many countr ies. In contrast, in an upside scenario, effective management of the pandemic combine with rapid vaccine deployment to set the st age for stronger growth outcomes. a The baseline and downside scenarios are an aggregat ion of individual country scenarios, while the upside and severe downside scenarios are model-based. The baseline and downsid e scenarios cover 182 countries, including 146 EMDEs. The model-based upside and severe downside scenarios are modelled as deviation s from the baseline and the downside scenario, respectively. CHAPTER 1 GLOBAL ECONOMIC PROSPECTS | JANUARY 2021 40 represent a mixture of voluntary and involuntary so cial distancing, are integrated into a macroeconometric model. b Scenarios are further enhanced with assumptions of nancial stress, which are modeled as spikes in na ncial market volatility (annex 1.1). Baseline scenario Pandemic assumptions. In the baseline scenario, following a sharp resurgence that began toward the end of las t year, many economies are able to reduce the daily number of infections in the first half of 2021. The reduction in caseloads is made possible by a combination of stringe nt lockdown measures as well as less costly pandemic-c ontrol policies such as social distancing guidelines and u niversal masking. In advanced economies and major EMDEs (including China, India, and Russia), inoculation w ith highly effective vaccines proceeds in the first qua rter of 2021\u2014first to vulnerable groups and subsequently to the general population\u2014and becomes widespread in the second half of 2021 (figure B1.4.2).c Social distancing eases gradually through the remainder of the foreca st horizon. The vaccination process is expected to be d elayed by two quarters in most other EMDEs and by four quarters in LICs, owing to logistical impediments t o vaccine production and distribution. Macroeconomic channels. Activity is assumed to recover gradually as caseloads decline and social distancin g eorts are relaxed, enticing households to increase their consumption of contact-intensive services. Firms gr ow cautiously optimistic in the face of a recovery in aggregate demand and a decline in pandemic policy uncertainty , and take advantage of historically low interest rates t o modestly increase the pace of investment and boost hiring. Sustained scal support assists displaced workers a nd cash- strapped rms in major economies and many EMDEs, while EMDEs facing scal space constraints manage t o avoid harsh austerity. 2#he vaccine rollout, coupled with accommodative monetary policy, underpins the contin u- ation of benign nancial conditions. Growth outcome. The baseline scenario projects a moderate expansion in global activity of 4.0 percent in 2021, following a 4.3 percent collapse in 2020 (Table 1.1). Global growth is then envisioned to slow to 3.8 perce nt in 2022. Despite the projected recovery in 2021 and 2022, output is expected to remain well below pre-pandemic trends at the end of the projection horizon. Growth in EMDEs is expected to bounce back to 5 percent in 2021 from a 2.6 percent contraction in 2020, before slowing to 4.2 percent in 2022. The modest rebound in EMDE growth would not be enough to restore debt sustaina bility in some EMDEs, with the gap between the debt- stabilizing and the actual primary balance for EMDEs remaining negative through 2022. Following a sharp contraction of 9.5 percent in 2020, global trade is exp ected to experience a modest pickup to an average of 5.1 pe rcent in 2021-22. For additional details, see the Global Outloo k section of chapter 1. Downside scenario Pandemic assumptions. Insufficient pandemic management and lax compliance with social distancin g measures leads to notably higher levels of new cases in many countries in 2021, requiring longer-lasting and more stringent pandemic-control measures. Relative to th e baseline scenario, vaccine deployment in advanced economies and major EMDEs is slowed by supply bottlenecks and the reluctance of a higher proportio n of the population to receive vaccinations.d As in other scenarios, rollout in other EMDEs and LICs begins up to four quarters after rollout in advanced economies a nd major EMDEs owing to logistical issues. Caseloads d ecline only gradually through 2022, mostly due to sustained social distancing. Macroeconomic channels. Activity remains depressed, as households fear contact-intensive services, includi ng recreation and tourism, and grapple with stringent social distancing measures. Firms\u2014facing pandemic-control policies, a bleak outlook for consumer demand, and elevated uncertainty\u2014curtail investment and hiring p lans. b 2#he Oxford Global Economic Model\u2014a large-scale global semi- structural projection model\u2014is used to conduct the s imulations described here (Oxford Economics 2020). 2#he model in cludes 81 individual countries (35 advanced economies and 46 EMDEs), most of which are available at a quarterly frequency, with behavioral equations governing domestic economic activity, monetary and scal policy, global trade, and commodity prices. c In all scenarios, the eectiveness of COVID-19 vacc ines is assumed to be 85 percent\u2014slightly lower than recently repor ted eectiveness\u2014to accommodate for the rollout of Pzer economies and large EMDEs is assumed to pr oceed at a slow pace initially and accelerate quickly as logistical and supply impediments are overcome. In the baseline scenario, the share o f the population amenable to inoculation is assumed to be about two- thirds based on global survey evidence (Lazarus et al. 2020). d Only about half of the population in advanced econo mies and major EMDEs is assumed to be amenable to vaccinatio n, a level broadly consistent with the lower bound from global survey evidence (Lazarus et al. 2020).

While accommodative monetary policy keeps financial crise s at bay, fiscal sustainability concerns limit the size of additional fiscal stimulus, leading to insufficient income support to the unemployed and struggling small- and medium-sized firms. Growth outcome. The downside scenario features a much weaker and more protracted recovery, with global gro wth limited to 1.6 percent in 2021 and 2.5 percent in 2022. e In the downside scenario, the recovery in advanced economies is stunted, with growth averaging less th an 2 percent over 2021-22. Similarly, projected output growth in EMDEs would be markedly reduced from an average o f nearly 5 percent in the baseline scenario to about 3. 3 BOX 1.4 Global growth scenarios (continued) A.

In the baseline scenario, a decline in cases, a vaccine ro llout that gathers pace in early 2021, and the even tual easing of pandemic- control measures underpin a modest rebound. In the downside scenario, persistently higher caseloads, m ore stringent involuntary social distancing, and slow vaccine dev elopment markedly weaken the recovery. In the sever e downside scenario, widespread financial stress and mounting firm bankruptcies trigger financial crises, causing a second year of global recession. In the upside scenario, effective pandemic management, coupled with prompt widesprea d vaccination, allows activity to recover faster. Sources : Oxford Economics; World Bank.

The materialization of the downside scenario would hit commodity- and tourism-dependent EMDEs particularly hard (chapter 2). Among EMDE regions, growth would be lowest in LAC, MNA and SSA, reflecting a heavy reli ance on exports of oil and industrial commodities, the p rices of which would be reduced by weak global demand. Moreover, a worsening of the pandemic across all re gions percent over 2021-22. By 2022, global and EMDE output would still be 3.5 and 2.5 percent, respectively, bel ow output in the baseline scenario. Weaker growth would worsen debt sustainability across EMDEs. Even in 2022, after two years of recovery, the gap between the debt - stabilizing and the actual primary balance for EMDEs would still be about twice as large in the downside s cenario as in the baseline scenario, setting government debt on a steeper rising path. Global trade growth would recov er somewhat faster than global output growth, in line w ith BOX 1.4 Global growth scenarios (continued) A.

Severe downside scenario Pandemic assumptions. As in the downside scenario, the pandemic in the severe version is much more difficu lt to manage than in the baseline scenario, and the vaccin e rollout is delayed. Longer-lasting and more stringe nt pandemic-control measures are needed through 2021 and beyond to achieve a sustained reduction in caseloads . Macroeconomic channels . The severe downside scenario differs from the downside scenario's assumptions in the authorities' inability to stave off widespread finan cial market stress . The prolonged period of depressed consumption and investment caused by persistent soci al distancing erodes corporate balance sheets to an ext ent that triggers widespread corporate defaults and concerns about bank balance sheets. Banks, in turn, sharply curtail their lending activities at a time when sovereigns are ha rd- pressed to expand emergency lending programs, with fiscal space constrained by the realization of loan guarant ees in advanced economies and capital flight in EMDEs. Sev eral countries experience financial crises, which reverbe rate through the global economy in the form of sharply ti ghter financial conditions, diminished domestic and forei gn demand, and plummeting commodity prices. An extende d period of debt-deleveraging and subdued growth follow s the initial crisis, compounding the pandemic's toll on the supply side of the economy. Growth outcome. In this scenario, widespread financial crises, combined with a prolonged pandemic and delay ed vaccination, would plunge the global economy into a second year of recession in 2021, before growth returns to a subdued rate of nearly 2 percent in 2022. f Advanced economies and EMDEs excluding China would experienc e a renewed contraction in 2021. As with global output, global trade growth would contract for a second consecutive year, followed by a subdued bounceback in 2022. Severe output losses and rising borrowing cost would cause the gap between the debt stabilizing and the actual p rimary balance to balloon to almost five times that in the ba seline scenario in 2022. Hence, even once the recovery starts in 2022, it would take a front-loaded fiscal consolidation of nearly 5 percent of GDP, on average in EMDEs, to stabilize debt at its long-term median. Upside scenario Pandemic assumptions. Following the recent upsurge in global cases, effective public education campaigns an d concerted multilateral coordination efforts would e nsure a high degree of compliance with pandemic-control pol icies around the world, allowing many economies to begin rolling back the stringency of pandemic-control meas ures starting in the first half of 2021. Immunization campa igns proceed promptly in advanced economies and major EMDEs at the start of 2021. Widespread vaccine deployment is achieved by mid-2021 in advanced economies and major EMDEs, and up to four quarters later in other EMDEs and LICs. Macroeconomic channels. Activity rebounds sharply as social distancing eases and households increase the ir demand for services amid substantial gains in emplo yment and wages. Simultaneously, economic uncertainty dissipates, encouraging firms to invest heavily in new equipment and technologies. Positive developments i n vaccine rollout\u2014alongside the widespread release of affordable breakthrough therapeutics\u2014trigger a sustain ed surge in equity markets and more benign global finan cial conditions. While extraordinary monetary policy accommodation begins to wane as employment improves, fiscal policy helps support workers throughout a le ngthy sectoral reallocation process. Moreover, the shared global experience of combatting COVID-19 is assumed to strengthen multilateralism, with a renewed push for global trade agreements and a rules-based international tra ding system contributing to stronger global trade growth. Growth outcome. Overall, in this scenario, global growth would strengthen notably, to nearly 5 percent in 2021, with advanced economies and EMDEs growing 4.1 percent and 5.8 percent, respectively.g Still, world growth in 2022 would be not much stronger than the baseline, f The degree of financial stress induced by the pande mic is assumed to be comparable to that during the global financia l crisis, with the VIX volatility index averaging 53 points over 2021Q2 an d 2021Q3, compared to an average of 52 in 2008Q4 and 2009Q1. Credit spreads increase by 420 basis points on average over 2021Q2 and 2021Q3, compared to an average increase of 426 basis points in 2008Q4 and 2009Q1. g Faster vaccine deployment meaningfully reduces the projected number of COVID-19 cases relative to the baseline, allowing for a faster easing of social distancing. On its own, the upside vaccine assumption is estimated to increase global growth by 0.4 percenta ge point in both 2021 and 2022. The remainder of the upside revision rela tive to the baseline scenario reflects reduced involuntary social distan cing brought on by a faster resolution of the pandemic, and improved fin ancial conditions. CHAPTER 1 GLOBAL ECONOMIC PROSPECTS | JANUARY 2021 44 A period of persistently low commodity prices could worsen the prospects of commodity- exporting economies and regions such as MENA. This could lead to fiscal tightening, slow their recovery from the global pandemic, and increase the risk of some countries falling back into recession should additional negative shocks occur. Disruptions from natural disasters and weather- related events are a persistent source of severe downside risk for a host of economies, especially in LICs and island economies in East Asia and Pacific (EAP) and LAC. Many categories of extreme events are becoming more frequent as a result of climate change (Smith et al. 2020). Droughts and wildfires are making some areas uninhabitable, and potentially permanently changing ecosystems (Staal et al. 2020). Although global food stocks are elevated, food insecurity remains a concern, particularly in low-income countries, as a result of declining household incomes as well as localized price spikes in some regions. Upside risks Although downside risks predominate, stronger- than-expected outcomes cannot be ruled out, especially if the vaccine rollout proceeds faster than currently anticipated. As discussed in box 1.4, the pace of vaccine deployment could surpass financial market expectations, triggering a sharp rise in confidence and ushering a strong rise in domestic demand. Consumption and investment would strengthen steadily as employment recovers and pandemic-induced uncertainties dissipate, and the hardest-hit services sectors such as restaurant s and tourism would experience a sharp uptick from pent-up demand. It is also possible that the shared global experience of combatting COVID-19 ushers in a renewed move toward multilateralism. Greater support for a stable, open, and rules-based international trading system could drive a reduction in tariffs, an uptick in trade, stronger foreign investment in EMDEs and, ultimately, more robust global growth. Over the longer-term, some of the changes in practices that took place during the pandemic may rising costs for businesses, fragmentation in global economic links, and lower productivity (Antr\u00e0s 2020). This could stem from the simmering trade disputes involving major economies, as well as the diminished role of global bodies in recent negotiations. In addition, many countries have signed bilateral supply agreements with vaccine manufacturers; if not properly coordinated, this could lead to an undersupply of vaccines in other countries, which would be unable to control further COVID-19 outbreaks. Similarly, some border and trade restrictions imposed to slow the spread of the pandemic could be maintained even after the health crisis dissipates. A further erosion in global cooperation risks reducing the world's ability to deal with increasingly urgent trans-national problems, including future health crises as well as climate change and global poverty. This would be particularly damaging for countries following export-led development strategies, which become less viable when global trade is impaired. Region-specific downside risks Many regions remain vulnerable to civil unrest, particularly where inequality is elevated, governance is poor, and economic growth is weak\u2014all of which could be exacerbated as a result of the pandemic. Social unrest remains at a high level in parts of LAC, ECA, and MENA, and falling per capita incomes could trigger rising discontent in SSA and elsewhere. Similarly, geopolitical risks remain an important risk, to varying degrees, across EMDE regions. Both civil and international military conflicts are associated with severe disruptions to growth. BOX 1.4 Global growth scenarios (continued) with the upside to growth limited by scarring from t he exceptionally severe downturn in 2020. By 2022, global and EMDE output would be only 1.7 and 1.8 percent, respectively, above the baseline scenario. Such a rob ust recovery might be enough to stabilize EMDE debt at i ts long- term median. Global trade growth would experience a strong recovery, averaging nearly 7 percent over "}
