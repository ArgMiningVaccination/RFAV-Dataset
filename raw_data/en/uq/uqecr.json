OM & CH, MSOM Owner and Founder of Earth Sea Acupuncture People often ask me how I got into Chinese medicine and acupuncture, so here goes. When I was three years old I had heart surgery to correct a defect I was born with. A formidable event at any age, this early life event influenced me a great deal, so much so that I thought I wanted to become a heart surgeon when I grew up. Eventually I fully understood what that would involve while I also found myself drawn to holistic types of medicine and healing. In college I followed my mother's footsteps into philosophy and enjoyed exploring thought and humanity from that perspective. I attended UNH for two years where I lived with some avid rock-climbers who were also into crystals. That was the turning point for me, in some ways, as I dove into the world of crystal healing. My love of nature and connection to the Earth has gotten me through so much. Being connected to the natural world and geeking out on crystals led me to learn an energy healing system and develop a meditation practice. By that time, I had moved to the west coast, finished my undergrad work at Lewis and Clark College, tried being vegan, done some juice cleansing, went back to eating meat and discovered acupuncture. My profound experiences with acupuncture, combined with a persistent nagging pull to find my path towards a career in natural medicine led me to graduate school. I graduated with honors from the National University of Natural Medicine in Portland, Oregon where I had awesome teachers and extensive mentorship. I am nationally board certified in Chinese Herbology and Oriental Medicine from the NCCAOM and licensed in Vermont. Being back in the Northeast and closer to my family of origin is such a blessing. My husband and I love Vermont and are so glad we took the leap to come here. A little about how I practice: I am committed to creating a safer space for you to explore yourself, your relationship to your body and for you to discover more joy and magic in each day. I practice trauma informed care and believe in a weight inclusive way of being with folks. I believe that our bodies have innate wisdom which can be awoken to increase healing and wellness. I strive to practice non-judgement and to be present with an open heart each day while being my authentic self (this is all a work in progress, for sure). I look forward to exploring with you! Allison is not accepting new patients at this time, follow up appointments are for established patients only. Lindsay Quenneville, L.Ac., Dipl.Ac &CH, MAOM Acupuncture Associate Lindsay Quenneville is a graduate of the New England School of Acupuncture (NESA) at Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences (MCPHS). She is a Lic. Ac., MAOM, and is NCCAOM board-certified in Acupuncture and Chinese Herbology. Lindsay has experience in treating chronic and acute pain, anxiety, insomnia, fibromyalgia, post-stroke, migraines, women's health and fertility, stress and tension, and digestive complaints. The journey that led Lindsay to becoming an acupuncturist is one she will be forever grateful for. Since Lindsay was young, she always envisioned a career in providing and advocating for individuals' emotional and physical well-being. As she was completing her degree in Social Work with a minor in Special Education at The University of Vermont (UVM), she was provided the opportunity to work at Vermont Community Acupuncture as a receptionist and soon after as the office manager. She loved seeing the effect that the medicine had on each patient's overall condition and later decided to attend NESA and become an acupuncturist and herbalist! She feels extremely fortunate to be able to practice acupuncture at both Earth Sea Acupuncture and Vermont Community Acupuncture. Lindsay is very passionate about mental health and as a practitioner, she vows to always meet the patient where they are, to be present, and give them her full attention. Outside of work, Lindsay enjoys spending time with friends, family and her two cats Beans and Lucy. Kayaking at the Waterbury Reservoir is one of her favorite activities, along with nature walks, reading, swimming, listening to music, and working on puzzles. Nyssa Green, L.Ac., Dipl.Ac &CH, MAOM Acupuncture Associate I have always been fascinated by the body and amazed at how we can take the components of food, air, and water to create all the complexity of function in these bodies we walk in. As a child I dreamed of growing up to be an old wise-woman in a cottage full of herbs with a goat as my companion! But coming up in a family of scientists and engineers I instead went on to study nutrition at the University of Maryland. After graduating and working as a researcher for a couple years I felt alienated by the sterility of the medicine I was studying; I had a deep knowing that we are dynamic beings and the state of our minds, bodies, spirit, and environment profoundly impacts our health. So I began practicing yoga and meditation, I found a beautiful sangha in Northern Virginia and had some profound experiences with Indigenous American healing ceremonies. In the clarity that emerged from nurturing my own presence I finally stopped avoiding that yearning to be the herbal woman offering her gifts to support the healing of her community. I totally switched gears from my career in Western allopathic medicine and went on to study East Asian Medicine at the New England School of Acupuncture. I then earned my national board certification (NCCAOM) in acupuncture and herbology and became licensed to practice in Vermont so that I might have the privilege of supporting the people in my community. I see this as a sacred path, to walk this healing journey with my patients, as we explore together their patterns of imbalance and how to build resilience and comfort into their lives. I practice trauma informed care and bring a compassionate, non-judgemental presence to my role as your acupuncturist, that is my aspiration and my practice. When I'm not in the clinic I am often playing legos or singing with my 2 kids, cooking, crafting medicines, watching my fav shows, or in the fields or garden enjoying this Vermont life. "}
