This study compared the costs and benefits of early peanut introduction (EPI) using data from five countries: US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom. Per child it was more expensive to provide early screening for all children with early-onset eczema and/or egg allergy than to have a \"wait and see\" approach. While there would be more peanut allergy diagnosis with early screening, the increased costs were too great compared to the no-screening approach. AHRQ-funded; HS024599.

Existing research on intra-hospital patient transitions focuses chiefly on handoffs, or exchanges of information, between clinicians. Less is known about patient transfers within hospitals, which include but extend beyond the exchange of information. Using participant observations and interviews at a 1,541-bed, academic, tertiary medical center, the investigators explored the ways in which staff define and understand patient transfers between units.

Despite progress in ICU safety, diagnostic errors remain largely unexplored and under-studied in critical care. Compared to other safety problems, diagnostic errors are more difficult to identify and, due to the intricacies of the diagnostic process, are more difficult to unravel. This paper discusses diagnostic error in critically ill patients, defines the problem and explores next steps to advance ICU safety. AHRQ-funded; HS022087. Citation: Bergl PA, Nanchal RS, Singh H .

This study examined the effect of hospital readmission reduction on patients at low, medium, and high risk of readmission in Medicare beneficiaries. The researchers theorized that the hospitals could be filled with more high-risk patients. National data from January 2009 to June 2015 was used to examine 5 specialty cohorts. The readmission rate was 16.2% for unplanned readmission within 30 days. There was a higher risk of readmission for surgery/gynecology and neurology cohorts but no significant increase in predicted risk for hospitalizations in medicine, cardiovascular, or cardiorespiratory cohorts.

This study examined how stress from uncertainty is related to resilience among medical residents and whether those attributes are related to depression and burnout. The investigators surveyed 86 residents in pediatric residency programs from 4 urban freestanding children's hospitals in North America in 2015. They used the Physicians' Reaction to Uncertainty Scale to measure stress from uncertainty, the 14-item Resilience Scale to measure uncertainty, the Harvard National Depression Scale for depression, and the Maslach Burnout Inventory for burnout. There was a response rate of 58.1%. Five residents met depression criteria, and 15 residents met the burnout criteria. Depressed and burned out residents both had higher mean levels of stress compared to residents who neither depressed nor burned out. AHRQ-funded; HS022986. Citation: Simpkin AL, Khan A, West DC .

Medical privacy policies, which are clear-cut for adults and young children, become ambiguous during adolescence. Yet medical organizations must establish unambiguous rules about patient and parental access to electronic patient portals. In this paper, the investigators conducted a national interview study to characterize the diversity in adolescent portal policies across a range of institutions and determine the factors influencing decisions about these policies.

Patient safety concerns over the past 2 decades have prompted widespread efforts to reduce adverse events (AEs). This study used a validated safety surveillance tool, the Global Assessment of Pediatric Patient Safety, to measure temporal trends (2007-2012) in AE rates among hospitalized children. The study concluded that AE rates in pediatric inpatients are high and did not improve from 2007 to 2012. Pediatric AE rates were substantially higher in teaching hospitals as well as in patients with more chronic conditions.

In this study, the investigators aimed to develop a comprehensive, descriptive framework to measure shared decision making (SDM) in clinical encounters. They listened to audio-recorded dialogue to identify all communication processes related to decision making and coded 55 pediatric otolaryngology visits using the framework and report interrater reliability. They identified 14 clinician behaviors and 5 patient behaviors that had not been previously described, and developed a new descriptive (what does happen), rather than normative (what should happen), SDM framework.

In this study, to identify residents at risk of attrition, the investigators analyzed American Board of Surgery In-Training Exam scores based on average rank and change in score. The investigators found that lower American Board of Surgery In-Training Exam scores were associated with attrition, but this difference was small, and some residents completed training with very low scores. A large drop in American Board of Surgery In-Training Exam scores from one year to the next appeared to be associated with attrition. AHRQ-funded; HS000066.
