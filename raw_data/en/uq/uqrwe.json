In August we welcomed Dr. Taiwona Elliott as new faculty, who brings a sure hand and passion for procedural training and a calm and thoughtful wisdom to both precepting and residency administration. Dr. Anna Landau joined us as faculty in Octo- ber after completing her Global Health Fellowship, working in Liberia and at the Arizona Indian Health Service site in Tuba City. In November we welcomed Kelsey Gender to our residency administrative team as our new Program Manager. Kelsey was working in the same capacity at Louisiana State University's Shreveport Family Medicine Residen- cy and was able to hit the ground running. As of January 1st, Dr. Elliott is our new Asso- ciate Program Director. Dr. Mari Ricker served in this role previously and was selected to be the Director of the Wellbeing Committee within the GME office, drawing on her expertise in physician wellbeing to benefit residents, fellows, and faculty within our organization. This month our residency administrative team met to define our program priorities for the year. Two major priorities rose to the top: Deeper integration of the Clinic First model within the residency Increased resident clinical and learning opportunities for integrative medicine through the lens of our program's mission for working with underserved populations Given our program's work over the last couple of years in the ambulatory setting, our program was selected to participate in the Association of Family Medicine Residency Director's Clinic First Collaborative which is co - sponsored by the University of California, San Francisco Center for Excellence in Primary Care. The Collabora- tive supports family medicine residency programs to develop structures to synergistically fulfill both missions of education and patient care to invigorate the current and future workforce in primary care. Dr. Katie Hartl, who nationally represents family medicine residents on the AFMRD board, is our resident lead, and Dr. Ravi Grivois -Shah as our medical director and myself as Residency Program Director are the faculty leads. The Collaborative kicks off at the end of February in Kansas City, Missouri, and meetings and formal support con- tinue through January 2019. I wrote previously of the principles of Clinic First (Engaged Leadership, Resident Scheduling, Resident Engage- ment, Team -based Care, Continuity of Care) and look forward to cultivating existing partnerships with the College of Pharmacy and their pharmacy students and residents under the leadership of our new pharmacist Dr. Bernadette Cornelison, and to forming new partnerships supported by recently awarded departmental funding to develop integrated care for mental health care within primary care. A group of integrative medicine trained faculty met last year to explore options for increasing opportunities for residents to participate in integrative medicine being practiced in the clinics. In February, Dr. Ingrid Patsch will be joining our program as faculty with a concentration in the ambulatory setting after completing an interprofessional integrative medicine fellowship through the Academy of Integrative Health and Medicine. We plan to continue our conversation about these clinical opportunities with Dr. Patsch as part of our team as we attend the national Integrative Medicine for the Underserved conference this June. Undoubtedly, hav- ing Dr. George Schatz, currently one of our chief residents, as one of our integrative medicine fellows in July will also help shape the program and integrative medicine fellowship in new ways. Over the past three and a half years as Program Director, I have come to realize that when you have the right team assembled, anything is possible. I'm grateful for both the new members of our team as well as our many faculty, staff, and residents who have been reliable \"MVPs\" on our team during our recent transitions. Like the old adage says, it truly takes a village to do this work and I look forward to what our village will pro- duce over the next year. From the Program Director...

Our monthly language didactic sessions are led by Jaime Fat\u00e1s -Cabeza, University of Arizona's Director of the Undergraduate Translation and Interpretation Program, who is a certified court and healthcare in- terpreter. Additionally, we participate in monthly luncheons which serve as an informal way to practice our Spanish skills with fellow residents. We are also provided with supplementary online study materials and access to Canopy Medical Spanish Online Training. The participants in the Distinction Track host bi -monthly forums for all residents, faculty and staff on topics related to healt h disparities within our Tucson community and abroad. Our next forum is on February 7, 2018 entitled Drug Addiction: Impact on Our Communiti es. Our mission is to prepare physicians to provide excellent family -centered, community - responsive care, with an emphasis on diverse and underserved populations. Our program's core values: Promotion and valuing of diversity Working with underserved populations Creation of a positive and supportive learning environment Maintenance of strong, well rounded academics AAFP Grant Vaccine Videos Written by Jacqueline Huynh, third year resident Our residency program, under project leaders Jacqueline Huynh, third year resident, and Christine Chan, second year resident, were awarded a $11,200 grant from the AAFP Foundation in August 2017 to improve vaccination rates among adoles- cents, ages 11 -21 years. Central to our grant was developing and producing short 2 -3 minute videos highlighting the importance of the vaccines recom- mended in this age group: HPV, Tdap, Meningococ- cal, and Influenza Vaccines. These videos are designed for the adoles- cents to view while waiting in the doctor's office, in an informative medi- um they use: electronic. The HPV and Influenza videos were targeted as a myth -busting Q&A information session in a short 2 -3 minute clip. We would like to share our project with other family medicine practices throughout the state, to help boost vaccination rates for these vaccine preventable diseases. Videos can be viewed at: Meningitis: https://vimeo.com/233578773 Tdap: https://vimeo.com/233580132 GME Resident Excellence Scholarship Erica Gadzik, second year resident, is the recipient of the UA Office of Gradu- ate Medical Education's 2017 Fall Resi- dent Excellence and Leadership Schol- arship. This reflects on her exceptional performance as a resident and her po- tential for a successful career in aca- demic medicine. The UA Office of Graduate Medical Education scholarships provide support to promote career -enhancing opportunities and experiences during a resident's training. Funding may support the pursuit of an original research proposal, partici- pation at a national conference, leadership or advocacy training, or a unique elective experience. Erica's goal is to increase knowledge of point of care ultra- sounds for family medicine residents. Her plan is to use the scholarship funds to obtain a handheld ultrasound machine in clinic, which will be used for both education and patient care, and to develop a more robust ultrasound teaching curriculum at the Alvernon clinic. 3 AAFP Family Medicine Advocacy Summit Resident Scholarship Awarded to Christine Chan Written by Christine Chan, second year resident In residency, I have had the pleasure of working with the Tucson Family Advocacy Program, a medi- cal-legal partnership that strives to help low -income patients and their families navigate some of the socio -economic crises that disrupt health. This unique collaboration has allowed me to help my patients ensure safe living conditions, have enough food for their growing families, and become citizens of the United States. I am incredibly thankful for the opportunity to advocate for these individuals, but as I get further along in my career, I realize that I need to use my voice to support broader change. In May, I will be attending the Family Medicine Advocacy Summit to learn more about the issues that affect our specialty and practice using my voice to support Family Medicine on a national level. As Family Physicians, we are dedicated to embracing the whole person as well as whole popula- tions; and we are especially committed to providing respect and as much help as we can to those who are marginalized and silenced. We are advocates just as much as we are healers, and while my education thus far has supported me in learning to be a healer, I have had less formal training in learning to be a strong and effective advocate. I will be attending the Family Medicine Advocacy Summit on behalf of not only my patients, but also all the Family Physicians who have inspired me thus far. Spotlight on Second Year Resident, Christine Chan Q: Where did you relocate from? A: University of Hawaii John A. Burns School of Medicine in Honolulu, HI Q: How have you adjusted and what do you enjoy most about Tucson? A: Although I am much farther from the beach, Tucson feels like a second home. It's only been a year and a half, but I've already made some lifelong friends! What do I enjoy most? Spending time with my husband and our new friends, dancing, hiking, playing with our dog at the park, and exploring this cool city and all the nearby sites. Q: Do you have a favorite restaurant? A: My husband is a great cook, and I love going to people's houses and eating what they whip up, but when we're craving pho, we head up to Thuan Kieu Restaurant in Lee Lee International Supermarket! Q: How did you unwind from the schedule of a First Year Resident? A: Enjoy work when you're there and spend time doing the things you love when you're off. Get a dog for cuddles, read books/ magazines/comics that have nothing to do with medicine, dance or run or just walk outside to get that body moving, and thank those people who support you through all your crazy schedules! Q: Any advice to future First Years Residents? A: Enjoy the ride and take some time every so often to remember why you went into medicine and what else matters to you. Thos e are the things that are going to ground you when the tough times come, and they'll certainly come. But you've been training f or this and you're going to do great!

Auricular acupuncture can be used alone or in conjunction with body acupuncture needles. The specific points can be stimulated with standard acupuncture needles, indwelling needles, magnets, or seeds/beads taped to the ear. What are the indications for auricular acupuncture? Ear points are frequently used in management of pain problems (acute or chronic), psychiatric issues (anxiety, PTSD, insomnia, depression), weight loss/appetite suppression and substance abuse, though this list is not exhaustive. What are the benefits of auricular acupuncture? - Easy to place - Easy to access the ear - Low risk - Well tolerated - No needles or pain with ear seeds/beads - It works!! What are ear seeds/beads? These are very small metal beads or seeds which are taped to the ear at specific acupuncture points and left in place for 5 -7 days. Patients are instruct- ed to occasionally press on the bead/seed to stim- ulate the acupuncture point. What are the complications of auricular acupuncture seeds/beads? - lightheadedness/fatigue after seeds/beads are placed - skin reaction to the taped used to hold the seeds/beads in place - mild pain/soreness at the site of the bead/seed What are the contraindications to auricular acupuncture? - pregnant patients - ear infection 5 Important Dates...

Location: Dr. McClure's home Book this month is: The Buddha in the Attic By Julie Otsuka Alvernon Hosts Honors College Interns Written by Arwa Abdel -Raheem, AmeriCorps Vista Service Member, QI and Population Health Coordinator at Alvernon The Alvernon Clinic started hosting UA Honors College interns and have them working with clinic leadership and nursing staff to develop and implement outreach initiatives for the specific patient population for their semester project. Alvernon Clinic has had in terns work on initiatives for pediatric vaccines, pediatric flu vaccines, our patients who have a diagnosis of diabetes, and cervical cance r screening out- reach. These students are minoring in Health and Human Values and are interested in working in the health care field. This semester, we are lucky to have three Honors College interns working with us on initiatives that we can implement in the clinic, and develop evidence -based education material for our providers and staff. The projects are working with the Referral Tracking Team at Al- vernon for mammogram and colonoscopy referrals, the Controlled Substance Review Committee (CSRC), and working on Advanced Car e Planning and Advanced Directives (ACP/AD). Ziad Hindosh is the Honors College student working on Advanced Care Planning and Advanced Directives. Ziad will first learn a nd get train- ing on Advanced Care Planning and Advanced Directives, in order to learn how to communicate our patients who need an Advanced Di- rectives form. Ziad will develop training, outreach and education materials for use in clinic and to be sent to patients, wor k within the electronic health record (EHR) to review patient charts, shadow providers, etc. Ziad will develop a script of some sort/or guidelines when speaking with patients one on one. He will work with our providers and staff by sitting in on morning huddles and identify patients who need Advanced Care Planning counseling and schedule them for an ACP/A D ap- pointment with their provider. The patient population at Alvernon Family Medicine Clinic includes many different demographics. This also comes with a lot of barriers when it comes to their access to health care. Some barriers and disparities when it comes to talking to our patients about Ad vanced Care Planning and Advanced Directives such as cultural (especially traditions and language). All cultures have different tradition s and ACP is a sensitive and difficult subject to discuss. Other barriers are emergency situations, education, limitations, etc. The interns hips at Alvernon Clinic will help improve patient's education, the staff at the clinic, and healthcare in these communities, as well as decrea sing the burden of health on patient's ability to live and work in the Tucson Community. 6 Spotlight on Faculty Member, Dr. Taiwona Elliott Q: Where did you go to medical school and complete residency?

I graduated from UAFMRP Alvernon in 2013. After resi- dency, I continued to put down roots in Tucson. I joined Tucson Family Medicine, part of Arizona Community Physicians, in August 2013. Initially I cared for patients in outpatient setting in the office as well as managed the practice's patients in the inpatient setting at Northwest Medical Center -ICU, CVICU, Med/Surg and inpatient rehab. Once my practice became full, I transitioned to full time outpatient medicine. I have a robust practice filled with patients of all ages! I have the privilege of taking care of many nuclear and extended families. Every day is different which is part of the joy of family medicine. I participate in the compli- ance committee for ACP and am an active shareholder. I am happily married to Nick, my husband of 11 years. We welcomed our first child, Finley Shea, to our family July 16, 2017. Life has not been the same in the best possible way. She has been a source of joy from day one. We have survived the first 6 months of parenthood! When I am not working I am enjoy- ing time at home with Nick, Finley and our two dogs. We still enjoy traveling (usually to somewhere with a warm beach) and cheering on our UA Wildcats! A Letter from Alumni, Androuw Carrasco, Class of 2016 It's official! POCUS has an official guidance in family medicine residency education backed by AAFP! I'm in India now which has been a stimulating time to put it straight. The people are beautiful. My local Hindi is near nil but I'm picking up the essentials like 'ulti' (vomiting), 'cahnsee' (cough), and 'Tai khaanaa khi has' (Lets have lunch now). My role here is more capacity building, teaching/ supervisory and self -learning. My clinical experience has certainly grown in the short time I left resi- dency but was glad to feel pretty prepared about 'being on my own' after graduation. I admit though, it feels inappropriate, or at the least weird, to 'supervise' Indian residents doing the things we're doing (aspirating a renal abscesses and bone marrow biopsies. Mm -hm). Many, many times I feel like the medical student wondering what the heck I'm looking at. I'm doing 1/3 ultrasound here, 1/3 ED, and 1/3 rural outpatient clinic. I'm teaching 3 -4 senior nurses who wanted to learn echo's in an effort to decrease the burden of the 1 nurse that was informally trained on performing echo's and serves the entire hospitals and most of the state's population. The state I am in has 30 million people. Only 1 nurse is known to do these echo's in a 500 mi radius. Then there is a radiologist supposedly outside o f this. There is a lot of rheumatic heart disease and tuberculosis here and as a consequence heart failure. The residents wanted to learn as w ell so I've started a bedside ultrasound curriculum tailored to the pathology they see (hydronephrosis with infiltrative TB or bladder ma lignancy in India vs. hydronephrosis from with nephrolithiasis in the states). The severity of poverty is profound. The degree of physiol ogic compensa- tion I've seen is nowhere but among the most poor. There is a lot of social infrastructure, local corruption, and cultural views that play into that of course. The hospital I'm at is one that has become a model for India's health care government. Its quite an inspirational story of good doctors and nurses who decided to do good and are sticking to it. They are also brilliant, innovative, and social justice trailblazers! Still not sure what I'll do after this year. Maybe retire in the Galapagos. But I'll keep Arizona in mind. -Androuw Carrasco \" Indeed, residency can be a lot to deal with for everyone. But it's way cool to appreciate how the advocacy that you and other fami- ly medicine faculty do for residents has translated into me advocating for patients in rural India. Keep up the good work.\" Androuw Carrasco, 16', (right) with a resident he learned local medicine from and is teaching ultrasound to. He will be serving rural India back at this hometown one day where there is no doctor. This is a cardiac ultrasound I did on a 1month old who was 02 dependent. Good news, I found out it's an atrial septal defect. Bad news, the mother can't afford traveling across India to New Delhi for a cardiothoracic surgeon . 8 H o s p i ta l C on s t r u c t i o n U p d a te R e n d e r i n g o f S e c o n d F l o o r C o n c o u r s e a n d C a f e T y p i c a l I n t e n s i v e C a r e P a t i e n t R o o m R e n d e r i n g o f N e w M a i n L o b b y a n d C o n c o u r s e Banner University Medical Center \u2014Tucson Campus Expansion The hospital expansion project is approximately 670,000 SF of new construction Scheduled to open April 2019 204 replacement beds 9 story building, 24 beds shelled for future internal expansion 75,000 SF of renovation in existing buildings $426.7 M total project budget (includes a Central Utility Plant) UA Family Medicine Residency Tucson Campus 707 N.
