Unlike traditional vaccine manufacturing, infectious agents are not required for manufacturing based on this platform. This platform technology is completely recombinant, enabling efficient and safe manufacture of vaccines against highly pathogenic targets. The platform manufacturing process uses no animal source material, there is no requirements for higher BSL facilities and, therefore, no safety threats.This recombinant technology platform is the basis for a portfolio of novel vaccines that represent important advances and address current unmet medical needs. H1N1 (Swine Flu) and Seasonal Influenza vaccines have already been licensed for commercialization in India. Other products currently under development include vaccines against Rabies Virus, Varicella Zoster Virus, Zika Virus, MERS Virus, Ebola Virus etc. The technology also enables Halal certification for the vaccines.H1N1 (Swine Flu) vaccine and Seasonal Influenza vaccines have already been Halal certified.
