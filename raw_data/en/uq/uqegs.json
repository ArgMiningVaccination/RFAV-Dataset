Patients that suffer from inflammatory bowel disease, which requires a constant need for medication, have to deal with the adverse effects of repeated application. Natural products such as Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) possess the potential to improve symptoms of inflammatory diseases. We investigated the efficacy of EGCG on an inflamed co-culture model simulating IBD and compared it to the efficacies of four commonly applied active pharmaceutical ingredients. EGCG (200 \u00b5g/mL) strongly stabilized the TEER value of the inflamed epithelial barrier to 165.7 \u00b1 4.6% after 4 h. Moreover, the full barrier integrity was maintained even after 48 h. This corresponds to the immunosuppressant 6-Mercaptopurin and the biological drug Infliximab. The EGCG treatment significantly decreased the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 (to 0%) and IL-8 (to 14.2%), similar to the effect of the corticosteroid Prednisolone. Therefore, EGCG has a high potential to be deployed as complementary medicine in IBD. In future studies, the improvement of EGCG stability is a key factor in increasing the bioavailability in vivo and fully harnessing the health-improving effects of EGCG.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-05-14", "cleaned_text": "The Potential of Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) as Complementary Medicine for the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease [https://doi.org/10.3390/ph16050748](https://doi.org/10.3390/ph16050748) [Bioactive Substances, Oxidative Stress, [1](#B1-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. Here, \"traditional indigenous health traditions, and the term \"complementary medicine\" is defined as a combination of a non-mainstream approach with conventional medicine, such as nutritional supplements (e.g., natural products) or manual therapies. \"Alternative medicine\" refers to the usage of these approaches instead of conventional medicine [ [2](#B2-pharmaceuticals-16-00748), [3](#B3-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) focuses on the integration of evidence-based complementary medicine in conventional therapy, as recently addressed in the NCCIH Strategic Plan FY 2021-2025 [ [4](#B4-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. Furthermore, the World Health Organisation (WHO) states in their WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy 2014-2023 that the development of norms and standards based on reliable data for T/CAM to safely integrate qualified and effective therapies in the health systems of the WHO Member States [ [5](#B5-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. Thus, it is evident that reliable and meaningful data for potential T/CAM therapies are required. One considerable motivation of the general public to utilize T/CAM in their daily life is the potential prevention and management of chronic, often lifestyle-related, diseases [ [1](#B1-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. A prominent example is patients that suffer from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) [ [6](#B6-pharmaceuticals-16-00748), [7](#B7-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. IBD is defined by chronic inflammations of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract that are subdivided into two main types of the disease: crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) [ [8](#B8-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. Numerous patients complement their conventional treatment of the symptoms with T/CAM applications, mostly herbal therapies [ [6](#B6-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. In this context, Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is a promising natural product for complementary therapy of chronic inflammations [ [9](#B9-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. [10](#B10-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. With respect to IBD, the efficacy of EGCG was shown by using various animal models mimicking UC or CD [ [11](#B11-pharmaceuticals-16-00748), [12](#B12-pharmaceuticals-16-00748), [13](#B13-pharmaceuticals-16-00748), [14](#B14-pharmaceuticals-16-00748), [15](#B15-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. For instance, EGCG significantly improved disrupted colon architecture and leukocyte infiltration and reduced the level of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) in a dinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (DNBS) rat model. Moreover, disease-related symptoms such as diarrhea and weight loss were improved [ [11](#B11-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. The efficacy of EGCG for the treatment of IBD was further evaluated by comparison with the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) sulfasalazine that was applied to treat an acetic acid-induced colitis rat model or a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) mouse model. Analogous effects for EGCG and sulfasalazine were observed, such as a decrease in the disease activity index (DAI) and histological score, as well as the reduction of TNF-, INF-, and the nuclear factor-Bp65 (NF- Bp65) serum levels [ [12](#B12-pharmaceuticals-16-00748), [13](#B13-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. Recently published studies underline the potential of EGCG for the treatment of IBD in animal studies [ [14](#B14-pharmaceuticals-16-00748), [15](#B15-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. However, the transfer of the EGCG data to the human condition remains an evident challenge [ [16](#B16-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. One reason is the low bioavailability and stability of EGCG at physiological conditions due to its chemical structure or glucuronidation of EGCG, is reported to be highly dependent on the tissue and the species [ [19](#B19-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. Further open questions that need to be addressed are the dose-finding as well as the time and frequency of administration [ [16](#B16-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. The most prominent challenge is the translation of the EGCG in vitro data to the human in vivo situation to achieve a non-toxic, effective dose [ [22](#B22-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. Although several clinical trials were performed and are still ongoing, EGCG has not been approved for medical usage yet and showed in some clinical trials a rather poor efficacy combined with a low plasma concentration [ [10](#B10-pharmaceuticals-16-00748), [16](#B16-pharmaceuticals-16-00748), [22](#B22-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. Therefore, the investigation of EGCG efficacy using human-based, reliable, and predictive in vitro models that simulate different tissues and diseases for pre-clinical assessment are required to improve the limitations of EGCG. [23](#B23-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. We identified the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) as the most predictive readout, which facilitates the investigation of the epithelial barrier integrity in IBD. Additionally, the mode of action-dependent effect on the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines can be analyzed [ [23](#B23-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. We aimed for the comparison of the EGCG efficacy with the efficacies of commonly applied APIs in IBD related to four different severity levels: from minor inflammations up to major inflammations. The investigation of EGCG on the same in vitro model in an equipotent concentration enables both: the assessment of the general efficacy and the evaluation of the efficacy level (minor up to strong) on two disease-related key compartments: the intestinal barrier and the immune system. The results might augment the database for T/CAM integrating EGCG as a promising complementary medicine. The presented in vitro model provides the possibility to investigate improved formulations of EGCG for the treatment of IBD with respect to stability enhancement or increased bioavailability to address limitations in vivo. In our experimental setup, we tested EGCG at the two concentrations 2 \u00b5g/mL and 200 \u00b5g/mL. EGCG was applied to the immune cells located in the basolateral compartment after the co-culture was inflamed. The integrity of the epithelial barrier was determined over 48 h by TEER measurements. In addition, the effect of EGCG on the immune cells was investigated by analysis of the cytokine release. The cell viability of the epithelial and immune cells was determined to investigate possible cytotoxic effects during the treatment. In a next step, the effect of EGCG on the non-inflamed intestinal Caco-2 barrier was analyzed in more detail. Finally, we compared our results for EGCG with the efficacies of the APIs currently used in the treatment of IBD. 2. Results 2.1. EGCG Treatment of the Inflamed Co-Culture [Figure 1](#pharmaceuticals-16-00748-f001)shows the effect on the barrier properties of the Caco-2 cells located in the apical compartment determined by TEER measurements after 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h. The application of 2 \u00b5g/mL EGCG showed no measurable positive effect on the TEER values and was equal to the LPS control. However, the treatment with EGCG in the concentration of 200 \u00b5g/mL resulted in a significant increase in the TEER values up to 165.7 \u00b1 4.6% after 4 comparison to the co-culture (91.6 \u00b1 9.1%) and even to the co-culture without any stimulation (healthy state). After 24 h and 48 h, the increase in TEER in comparison to the LPS-inflamed group was still significant; however, it was decreasing over time and not as high as the TEER value measured after 4 h. Nevertheless, the EGCG treatment led to a regain of healthy barrier properties by restoring the TEER values to the level of the healthy co-culture. 2.2. Effect of EGCG on Cytokine Release of MDM [Figure 2](#pharmaceuticals-16-00748-f002)). In the healthy state, no TNF- was secreted; whereas the stimulation with LPS resulted in a TNF- release of 2086.9 \u00b1 118.42 pg/mL. \u00b5g/mL EGCG and 200 \u00b5g/mL EGCG) of the TNF- release compared to the inflammation control. A significant increase in the release after LPS stimulation (to 626.5 \u00b1 380.36 pg/mL) was additionally observed for IL-6. Similar to the TNF- release, no effect on the IL-6 release after the treatment with 2 \u00b5g/mL EGCG (588 \u00b1 431.54 pg/mL) was measurable; however, there was a significant change to the release of IL-6, which was undetected after the treatment with 200 \u00b5g/mL EGCG. The stimulation with LPS led to a significant increase of the IL-8 release (to 14,831.9 \u00b1 1702.29 pg/mL) medium control 488.43 pg/mL). While the EGCG no effect on IL-8 release, a significant effect for 200 \u00b5g/mL EGCG (decrease to 2100.6 the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, only a lower level of around 60 pg/mL was measured for all groups. 2.3. Cell Viability of the Co-Culture Setup after EGCG Treatment [Figure 3](#pharmaceuticals-16-00748-f003)). For the MDM, EGCG in the concentration of 2 \u00b5g/mL resulted in no decrease in cell viability, while the concentration of 200 \u00b5g/mL led to a decrease in cell viability of the MDM to 57 \u00b1 5.1%. 2.4. Monolayer [Figure 4](#pharmaceuticals-16-00748-f004)depicts the TEER values that were measured for 48 h after the stimulation with 200 \u00b5g/mL EGCG either in the basolateral or apical compartment. After 4 h of stimulation, a strong increase in the TEER values to 133.3 \u00b1 10.2% of the basolateral treated cells in comparison to the medium control (96.8 \u00b1 3.6%) was determined. This effect was still prominent after 24 h, with a decreased value of 109.3 \u00b1 5.8% which was further reduced after 48 h (88.1 \u00b1 5.0%). In contrast, the cells apically stimulated with EGCG showed no significant increase in TEER (102.3 \u00b1 3.4%) in comparison to the medium control. The TEER value decreased slightly to 90.7 \u00b1 2.5% after 48 h. 2.5. Comparison of EGCG's Efficacy with IBD-Related Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients [23](#B23-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. [Table 1](#pharmaceuticals-16-00748-t001)compares the efficacy of EGCG with our results for the four APIs: 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA, severity level 1), the corticosteroid Prednisolone (severity level 2), the immunosuppressant 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP, severity level 3), and the monoclonal antibody Infliximab (severity level 4). EGCG showed barrier stabilizing effects after 24 h, similar to the immunosuppressant 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) and the biological drug Infliximab. Based on the effect of EGCG after 4 h of incubation, the result fits the maximal effect that was measured for 6-MP after 48 h. Referenced to the decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine release of IL-6 and IL-8, EGCG corresponds to the effect of the corticosteroid Prednisolone. 3. Discussion [23](#B23-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)], the barrier stabilizing immunosuppressant 6-Mercaptorpurine (maximal effect: 134.33 Infliximab (92.2 \u00b1 6.2% after 24 h), representing level 3 and level 4 of severity. In the literature, Ran et al. and Oz et al. both observed analogous effects of EGCG and sulfasalazine in IBD mouse models [ [12](#B12-pharmaceuticals-16-00748), [13](#B13-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. However, there is a lack of data for the application of EGCG with IBD-related APIs. The results of our study confirm that EGCG has the potential to be a complementary medicine for IBD patients and should be further investigated. The decreasing effect of EGCG can be correlated with the auto-oxidation of EGCG in the cell culture medium. In the literature, the investigation of EGCG stability in 200 mM phosphate buffered saline at 37 \u00b0C showed the degradation into EGCG auto-oxidation products (EAOPs). After a mere 4 h of incubation, EGCG was undetected by HPLC analysis, whereas the content of the EGCG component gallic acid (GA) increased [ [17](#B17-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. Therefore, the enhancement of the stability of EGCG and the prevention of auto-oxidation might play a key role in the application of EGCG as complementary medicine in vivo. [24](#B24-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. This underlines the positive effect of EGCG on the barrier integrity that was observed in our study using 200 \u00b5g/mL (approximately 0.44 mM) EGCG. Additionally, a strong effect on TEER values of Caco-2 cells as monolayer was observed by Amasheh et al. after the application of 200 \u00b5mol/L of quercetin, a further polyphenol and nutrition factor. The barrier integrity already increased in their experiments after a few hours of incubation, comparable to our EGCG experiments, while the highest TEER value of 157 \u00b1 4% was measured after 48 h. Following that, the effect decreased; however, it was still higher for the 72 h measurement than for the control group [ [25](#B25-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. In a previous study, Amasheh et al. showed that the increase in TEER after the treatment with quercetin may be connected to an increase in the barrier-forming tight junction (TJ) protein claudin-4 expression and the assembling of claudin 4 in TJ domains and subdomains [ [26](#B26-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. The alternation of the TJ network is also a conceivable effect of EGCG on barrier integrity. The restoration of the TJ-proteins zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin, and claudin-1 after an intestinal injury induced by cyclophosphamide after EGCG treatment was recently shown in mice [ [27](#B27-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. Different IBD-related animal studies prove the positive effect of EGCG on DAI, histological damage, and intestinal permeability [ Furthermore, the potential of EGCG-rich Polyphenol E was investigated in a human pilot study, where UC patients received this medication as complementary medicine to their conventional drugs compared to a placebo group. A total of 66.7% of the patients in the EGCG-rich Polyphenol E group responded to treatment. Moreover, every patient that responded to the complementary treatment showed an improvement in their endoscopic score [ [30](#B30-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. Despite that, the full mechanisms behind the barrier-stabilizing effect of EGCG have not been fully investigated yet. [10](#B10-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. In our in vitro assay, we aimed for the simulation of IBD, and therefore, we integrated MDM as a component of the immune system, which enables the investigation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We observed no significant effect for the treatment with 2 \u00b5g/mL EGCG, although we detected a significant decrease in the release of IL-8 back to the level of the healthy co-culture after the treatment with 200 \u00b5g/mL EGCG. Additionally, IL-6 was undetected after the treatment with 200 \u00b5g/mL EGCG. The release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was not significantly affected, and for TNF-, no significant change was measured. However, especially for the TNF- measurements, a high standard derivation was present based on the donor dependency of the MDM. Nevertheless, the human origin and the potential to release high amounts of different cytokines induced by LPS stimulation [ [31](#B31-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)] are advantageous for simulating IBD. In comparison to the APIs for the treatment of IBD, EGCG showed a similar decrease in the release of IL-6 (to 0%) and IL-8 (to 14.2%) to the glucocorticoid (GC) Prednisolone (level 2 of severity). The mechanism of action of Prednisolone includes the binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) followed by an interaction of the GC with the GR, leading to changes in the conformation and the translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Subsequently, the GC/GR complex binds to specific glucocorticoid-responsive elements (GREs), which stimulate and suppress gene transcriptions, including the synthesis of NF-B and pro-inflammatory cytokines [ [32](#B32-pharmaceuticals-16-00748), [33](#B33-pharmaceuticals-16-00748), [34](#B34-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. The activation of NF- B and its translocation into the nucleus play a central role in IBD [ [35](#B35-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. The mode of action of EGCG has not been fully investigated yet; however, effects on different pathways were identified in previous studies [ [36](#B36-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. For instance, Yang et al. showed that EGCG successfully inhibited the IB kinase complex activity and, therefore, the activation of NF- B in vitro [ [37](#B37-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. The blocking of NF- B activation leads to a reduced release of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines [ [35](#B35-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. Shin et al. showed that the treatment of inflamed human mast cells-1 (HMC-1) with 100 \u00b5M EGCG resulted in a decrease in the TNF-, IL-6, and IL-8 level by the attenuation of and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) [ [38](#B38-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. Additionally, these effects on the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines have been proven by numerous animal studies [ [11](#B11-pharmaceuticals-16-00748), [12](#B12-pharmaceuticals-16-00748), [13](#B13-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. In regard to human-derived data, LPS-stimulated with the T cell subpopulation CD4+ CD45+ RO, isolated from the peripheral blood of IBD patients, showed a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine production as well as a significantly induced apoptosis of the mentioned cell populations after 24 h of treatment with 5 \u00b5g/mL EGCG [ [39](#B39-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. Correlating with these results, we observed in the co-culture system a significant decrease in the MDM viability to 57 \u00b1 5.1% after 48 h of treatment, while the Caco-2 cells were not affected. However, to investigate the cell viability in more detail and to increase the reliability, additional methods such as the adenylate kinase assay might be considered. [17](#B17-pharmaceuticals-16-00748), [40](#B40-pharmaceuticals-16-00748), [41](#B41-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. Additionally, several factors that have an influence were identified, such as storage conditions, pH, temperature, or the level of serum albumin in the blood plasma [ [16](#B16-pharmaceuticals-16-00748), [18](#B18-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. In human blood plasma, the peak concentration for an oral dose of EGGC (2 mg/kg) taken after overnight fasting was reached after 1 to 2 h and was decreased constantly to undetectable amounts after 24 h. The calculated elimination half-life of EGCG was 3.4 \u00b1 0.3 h [ [42](#B42-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. In our in vitro experiments, we observed the most prominent effect of EGCG after 4 h of treatment. Further open questions are the dose-finding and the time and frequency of administration [ [16](#B16-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. Based on our results, EGCG should be administered daily. However, the transfer of dosages from in vitro to in vivo remains a significant hurdle. It is reported that the oral application in vivo of an equivalent dosage of 10 \u00b5M to 100 \u00b5M in vitro in the form of 2-3 cups of green tea led to a plasma concentration of only 0.1 to 0.6 \u00b5M [ [43](#B43-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. This underlines the need for increasing the bioavailability of EGCG in vivo. An improvement of the plasma level in humans was obtained by the intake of EGCG without caffeine yet in combination with the antioxidant ascorbic acid and omega-3 fatty acids derived from salmon after an overnight fasting period [ [16](#B16-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. Additionally, formulation strategies to attenuate the auto-oxidation processes might be a conceivable way to improve bioavailability. For instance, the stabilization of EGCG by encapsulation in chitosan nanoparticles resulted in enhanced intestinal absorption in mice and, therefore, higher bioavailability [ [44](#B44-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. Recently, Wang et al. improved the storage stability by forming an inclusion complex of EGCG and -cyclodextrin while combining the therapeutical potential of both compounds [ [15](#B15-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. Parallel to the susceptibility for auto-oxidation, it is shown that tea catechins similar to EGCG undergo biotransformation such as methylation, glucuronidation, sulfation, and ring-fission metabolism depending on the tissue and the species, leading to catechin metabolites with unknown biological activities [ [19](#B19-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. [9](#B9-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. The amelioration of inflammatory processes and immune responses, as well as oxidative stress by natural dietary polyphenols, could assist in the prevention of carcinogenesis for colorectal cancer [ [45](#B45-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)], which is known as the long-term complication of IBD [ [46](#B46-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. EGCG itself is reported as an epigenetic regulator for cancer and a strong chemoprotective compound that interferes with different cancer signaling pathways [ [21](#B21-pharmaceuticals-16-00748), [47](#B47-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. Furthermore, the potential of EGCG for the treatment of respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress symptom (ARDS) or COVID-19 due to its antioxidant, anti-fibrotic properties and the ability to attenuate the production of various inflammatory mediators is discussed in the recent literature [ [48](#B48-pharmaceuticals-16-00748), [49](#B49-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cell Culture Experiments 4.1.1. Co-Culture Setup [23](#B23-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)]. In brief, the Caco-2 cells were seeded in the apical compartment of Transwell\u00ae inserts (12-well plate, 12 mm Transwell\u00ae with polyester membrane inserts, 0.4 \u00b5m pore size, 1.12 cm2 growth area, Corning, Glendale, AZ, USA) until an intact epithelial barrier with TEER values > 500 * cm2 was established. Primary monocytes were isolated from human blood, obtained from the Blutspendezentrale Saar-Pfalz GmbH (Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany), and differentiated by the addition of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) into MDM. After 24 h of differentiation, the MDM were washed, and a fresh cell medium with GM-CSF was added. Subsequently, the MDM were incubated for 72 h and then seeded in the basolateral compartment of a 12-well plate. The MDM were grown in the well plate for 24 h, washed, and the Transwell\u00ae-inserts with the Caco-2 cells were carefully placed above the macrophages. The barrier integrity of the co-culture was investigated by TEER measurements (see [Section 4.2.1](#sec4dot2dot1-pharmaceuticals-16-00748)TEER measurements). All cells, single monolayers, and the co-culture setup were maintained at a constant humidity with 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C. of 4.1.4. Investigation of Viability of the Co-Culture Setup after EGCG Treatment 4.1.5. Investigation of ECGC Effect Caco-2 Monolayer MTT brief: at the end of the co-culture experiment (see section Treatment with EGCG), the cells were washed twice with 500 \u00b5L (Caco-2) and 1000 \u00b5L (MDM) 1x HBSS (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The medium control wells were used as a positive control (100% viability), and 1% Triton-X-100 (AppliChem GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) was Organics, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was added in a volume of 500 \u00b5L (apical) and 750 \u00b5L (basolateral). The cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C under permanent shaking at 35 rpm and exclusion of light. After removal of the MTT reagent, 500 \u00b5L apical and 750 \u00b5L basolateral DMSO were added to each well and incubated for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C under permanent shaking at 35 rpm and exclusion of light. The absorbance was measured at the wavelength 550 nm with the Plate Reader Synergy2 (BioTek Instruments GmbH, Bad Friedrichshall, Germany). The cell viability was calculated using the following formula: 4.3. Statistical Analysis 5.
