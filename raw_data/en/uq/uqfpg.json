The most common symptoms of IBS are abdominal pain or discomfort often reported as cramping, bloating, gas, diarrhoea, and/or constipation. IBS affects the colon, or large bowel, which is the part of the digestive tract that stores stool. IBS is not a disease. It's a functional disorder, meaning that the bowel doesn't work, or function, correctly. Causes of IBS Doctors are not sure what causes IBS. The nerves and muscles in the bowel appear to be extra sensitive in people with IBS. Muscles may contract too much when you eat. These contractions can cause cramping and diarrhoea during or shortly after a meal. Or the nerves may react when the bowel stretches, causing cramping or pain. IBS can be painful. But it does not damage the colon or other parts of the digestive system. IBS does not lead to other health problems. Symptoms of IBS The main symptoms of IBS are \u00b7 Abdominal pain or discomfort in the abdomen, often relieved by or associated with a bowel movement \u00b7 Chronic diarrhoea, constipation, or a combination of both Other symptoms are \u00b7 Whitish mucus in the stool \u00b7 A swollen or bloated abdomen \u00b7 The feeling that you have not finished a bowel movement Women with IBS often have more symptoms during their menstrual periods. Diet Changes Some foods and drinks make IBS worse. Foods and drinks that may cause or worsen symptoms include - Fatty foods, like French fries - Milk products, like cheese or ice cream - Chocolate - Alcohol - Caffeinated drinks, like coffee and some sodas - Carbonated drinks like soda To find out which foods are a problem, Keep a diary that tracks - what you eat during the day - what symptoms you have - when symptoms occur - what foods always make you feel sick Take your notes to the doctor to see if certain foods trigger your symptoms or make them worse. If so, you should avoid eating these foods or eat less of them. Some foods make IBS better. Fiber may reduce the constipation associated with IBS because it makes stool soft and easier to pass. However, some people with IBS who have more sensitive nerves may feel a bit more abdominal discomfort after adding more fiber to their diet. Fiber is found in foods such as breads, cereals, beans, fruits, and vegetables. Examples of foods with fiber include Fruits- apples, peaches Vegetables- broccoli (raw), carrots (raw), cabbage, peas Breads, cereals, and beans- kidney beans, lima beans, whole-grain bread, whole-grain cereal Does stress cause IBS? Emotional stress does not cause IBS. But people with IBS may have their bowels react more to stress. So, if you already have IBS, stress can make your symptoms worse. Stress Relief Learning to reduce stress can help with IBS. With less stress, you may find you have less cramping it easier to manage your symptoms. Meditation, exercise, hypnosis, and counselling may help. You may need to try different activities to see what works best for you. Points to Remember IBS means your bowel doesn't work the right way. IBS can cause cramping, bloating, gas, diarrhoea, and constipation. IBS doesn't damage the bowel or lead to other health problems. The doctor will diagnose IBS based on your symptoms. You may need to have medical tests to rule out other health problems. Stress doesn't cause IBS, but it can make your symptoms worse. Fatty foods, milk products, chocolate, alcohol, and caffeinated and carbonated drinks can trigger symptoms. Eating foods with fiber and eating small meals throughout the day may reduce symptoms.
