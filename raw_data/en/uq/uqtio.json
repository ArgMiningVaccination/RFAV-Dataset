I am so glad I found her + Healing Rituals. I initially came to Melina for acupuncture but during our initial appointment when we discussed my goals and what I was looking to accomplish - she recommended cupping. I have been getting cupping w her weekly ever since and it's had a huge impact on my overall health! I am trying to detox my system and it's helped tremendously w that, digestion as well as back pain & soreness. Melina's whole set up and environment is very calming. The meditation room is incredible and I really enjoy stopping in there after cupping. Melina is an incredible resource and so easy to work with/schedule with. I highly highly recommend! Business owner information Melina M. 4/14/2023 Thank you for your time and energy and kind words - 1/21/2023 I'm so happy to have discovered Melina and her healing touch. The cupping for me has been magical. A major release of muscle tension and getting my body back in gear. I can't say enough good things. - 7/5/2022 I can only judge on punctuality and timeliness since nobody ever showed up to my appointment. No phone call or txt message to cancel either. I drove 40 minutes in order to get to my appointment and I had arrived 10 minutes before the appointment. Business doors were closed and nobody answering calls. I had picked this place because of the great reviews. Unfortunately, I do not appreciate when businesses do not respect time. Business owner information Melina M. 7/6/2022 Hi Sue, I do apologize for not being able to contact you. I had A family emergency . Hope you find what you are looking for in your Healing journey. Melina M. - 1/14/2023 I had a great treatment by Melina. She explains everything so clearly and pays attention to details. The crystal bed warmed up to the perfect temperature along with the cupping made this treatment so enjoyable and relaxing. I slept so good after my treatment. Highly recommend her she is very knowledgeable about the human body and how emotions affect us in so many ways. Thank you Melina for your care and expertise! - 1/5/2023 I called Melina in the middle of a personal crisis, I needed help and she was kind enough to schedule me the very next day. She sensed I was in desperate need of help and made room in her busy schedule to see me asap and for that, I will be forever grateful. I'm still on my journey to heal and find peace but she has become a light in my path to make it easier. Taking it one day a time, her sessions have become a piece of mind in the middle of my non stopping thoughts. - 1/5/2023 Melina is a fantastic healer and I look forward to every visit with her. She spends time getting to know you and thoroughly explains everything she does. She has a wealth of knowledge and experience and I always leave revived in body, heart, and spirit. I live 1 1/2 hours away and she is definitely worth the trip! - 1/9/2023 I found this place by chance passing by in the neighborhood. I was really touched by Melina's care and passion in making sure everyone feels comfortable and leaves positive and refreshed. Melina is very kind and I really appreciate her dedication to her clients. It's obvious she cares and I'm lucky to have found her. - 1/26/2022 I've been suffering from major back problems after a totaled car accident in 2016. I've been to 3 different Acupuncturist 3 Chiro's and I am in love with Melina's service. She is so educated not only as an Acupuncturist but a spiritual healer and has these beds made of crystals that I totally love. I would HIGHLY recommend her for Accupuncture services or spiritual healing or both. SHE IS AMAZING! And I leave with a smile on my face everytime. Scared to move away! - 1/28/2023 I visited Melina for the first time last week and I have to say it was one of the best experiences ever! She took the time to address my concerns and walked me through everything she was doing. She was very knowledgeable and even gave me things to do at home until my next appt. Definitely will be back! - 1/27/2023 It was remarkable. A friend told me to go but I never took the time for myself. I am so glad I did . The cupping and acupuncture was just what I needed. My back feels better and I have a renewed perspective. Thank you dearly. I can't wait to go back .
