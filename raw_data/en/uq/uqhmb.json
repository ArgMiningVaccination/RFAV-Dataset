This thinking has some-thing defiant, like young people r unning away from home to then also seek out the sorting- out confrontation with the world. They wantto make clear that they just ar e how they are, and don't give a hoot about convention. Con- ventions are after all actually contracts inwhich arrangements are laid down to bridgeover the confrontation of differences. But someone who is defiant does not want bridges. He wants to state clearly: 'This is whatI am, and I won't put up with anything that Idon't want! This is my opinion and my pointof view and I won't have anything prescribedto me.' As an adult one needs to say: 'It's goodthat these young people develop and form theirown personality. This belongs to our time.'This is namely the time in which thinking,thanks to the successes of science, has won afinal victory over just believing.Yet at the same time this obstinacy of youth is thought-provoking for many adults.Will these strong personalities ever manage to step beyond their clear viewpoints and begin to communicate again, to sit down togetherinstead of setting apar t? In our day and age this concern is unfortunately more than justified. What is needed is a long breath and the ability to endur e confrontation of this kind. Only those who know who they are can really sit down together again, if old power struc-tures and dogma are not to take up the scepter.Unfortunately we have to realize that whilethinking can be liberating, it will unavoidablybring with it severe confrontation. The world will not be able to get around this painful process if it wants to go the way offreedom. Trust can grow in confrontation,without having to give oneself up in theprocess - trust in finding the other, in connect-ing in a new way out of one's own free will, asis actually said in the old word 'religion'.

This issimple in some ways, yet also essen-tial. The Anthroposophical Society is dedicated to collaborating with thegroups and initiatives in differentcountries, sharing ideas and concerns.Content and ideas need forms andstructures that belong to 'detail think-ing'. A world Society such as ours ismade up of members from many verydifferent countries, with diverse needsand expressions of anthroposophy. Itis critical that we understand thesedifferences and needs, that we observekeenly and with inter est what lives in the souls of members ar ound the world. In the School of Spiritual Sci- ence each Section manifests diversecharacteristics and possiblities. Eachof these must also be incorporated bythe whole in a striving to give voice towhat is universally human, and whatconnects us as human beings to thespiritual in the universe. Each elementmust also be suppor ted with practical deeds. In asking you now for your gen - erous financial support and gift, we ask you to recognize the urgent neces-sity to pr ovide a r eal and substantial basis for these elements - in the Goetheanum, the AnthroposophicalSociety and the School of SpiritualScience. Each individual can make afinancial commitment, and we arevery grateful for your participation and help at this time. Your willingness to donate, to recognize the necessityfor all of us to nur ture the care ofDear Members and Friends, It was slightly over 80 years ago that Rudolf Steiner, in a continualincrease in daily activity, gave theCurative Course in a series of 12 sem-inal lectures. Today, these are as essen-tial and important as in 1924. In the10th lecture Steiner offers the adviceto focus with devotion on the smalldetails of life. Within these details anentire universe can be found. Howev-er, this advice is not meant in a pedan-tic or small-minded way. It is a way totrain oneself in perceiving the contextand wholeness of a situation, andbuilding an attitude or mood around asituation. With our world becomingevermore complex, with global reali-ties embedded in events that are noteasy to understand, the concer n for the seemingly insignificant detail in our lives, in our surroundings, in ourcommunities and environment seemscompelling. By taking car e of the small things we learn to enhance and train our capacities and imbue themwith an attitude that connects us,rather than distancing us, from theworld. Such a statement can be r elated to the Goetheanum, to the world Soci- ety, to the School of Spiritual Science. These three areas interweave and pen- etrate each other. In each area we can,and must, focus with devotion on thedetails. In doing so we build a morecomplete sense of the whole and itsneeds. It is out of the interaction ofthe sometimes modest elements orachievements that we can observe therelevance to larger, even global events.

The Christian essence of themantras, the task of working effectively out in the world, andthe connection between the mantric work and the School were the themes taken up by those responsible for the regional andlocal car e of the esoteric contents of the First Class. The entire event stood under the sign: How can we strengthen the effective-ness of the School for Spiritual Sciencetoday, both inwardly and outwardly? Besides the substantial contribu- tions on the Christian aspect in the 19groups of mantras of the First Class,we also discussed in plenum as well asin the conversation groups the follow-ing set of questions in particular: How does the work with the 19 groups of mantra given by RudolfSteiner for the class members standwithin the contextual totality of theSchool, the Anthroposophical Societyand the public? One who becomes a member of the School gives expression to his willto be at the disposition of anthropo-sophical concerns - a representative ofanthr oposophy. In this task, the man- tras of the First Class ar e an invalu - able means. For this reason, the signif- icance of the conversation with theclass holder r egarding admission into the Class is not just in regard to being admitted to the context of those who At the meeting at the Goetheanum of the general secretaries with the execu-tive council and collegium, the agendaitems wer e, as also at other times, about the situation in the world as well as the care and development ofanthr oposophical work. In addition, the assembly also passed the formula- tion of rules of procedure drafted ayear ago. In keeping with this, thiscommittee of the General Anthropo-sophical Society is now called the'Council of General Secretaries andNational Representatives' (text on p.4). The new general secretaries ofNorway and Canada, Frode Barkved(see p. 6) and Philip Thatcher, respec-tively, introduced themselves. Truthfulness: Indicator of the State of the World In looking at the situation in theworld, Cor nelius Pietzner sketched the phenomenon of divergence from virtues that call for sensitive, truthfulcultivation in the social r ealm. Taking the example of truthfulness, he elabo- rated on distortion in lies and error aswell as seduction in all for ms of fun- damentalism and fanaticism. Pietzner made reference to the falsehood in politics and economics onhand of the example of George Bush'sreasons for going to war in Iraq(weapons of mass destruction, and aconnection between Saddam Husseinand Osama bin Laden), which so farhave showed themselves to be un-founded. He also referred to the bank-ruptcies of large companies. In politicsand spiritual life, according to Pietzner,a growing fundamentalism is comingto expression, such as religious fanati-cism becoming a political instrument. Common Motives At the conference of general secre- taries and the meeting of branch andgroup leaders, it became apparent thatboth gatherings had three main themesin common. With a view to common anthropo- sophical leitmotifs, Bodo von Plato madereference to Leading Thoughts , the Michael Letters , the statutes of the Anthroposophical Society thatwere passed in 1923/24, Rudolf Steiner's addresses during and after the Christmas Foundation Conference in 1923/24, aswell as the connection of esoterics andpublic openness, and asked how thesemotifs would be formulated today out ofactual anthroposophical work. The life of the Anthroposophical Society, which was a further founda-tional motif that Seija Zimmermanndepicted, wants to be carried by con-crete human relationship (see RudolfSteiner's lecture of September 5, 1924). Heinz Zimmermann placed con- crete initiatives in the center, particu-larly concerning spiritual scientificstudy and meditative practice, andencouraged work on these centralthemes in the School and Society. concerns themselves with these con- tents. It is about being admitted to theSchool of Spiritual Science, which, asthe General Anthroposophical Sectionand professional sections, has the cen-tral task of having the esoterics ofanthroposophy become enlivening inthe Anthroposophical Society and inthe end also effective in the widerworld. Given these aspects, what isthe meaning of the admission-conver-sation? And: What new challengescome about for the class holders as aresult of this? The School as a Total Organism What are the consequences of the fact that the contents of the School givenby Rudolf Steiner are accessible toanyone today, and that there are manygroups that work with these texts - within or outside of the context of the School? What are the problems result-ing from this and what are the practi-cal consequences to be drawn? In addition, there was conversa- tion about the relationship of theGeneral Anthroposophical Section to the professional sections being one ofa total organism permeated by allaspects of itself. Given this totalorganism, how can the GeneralAnthroposophical Section come todistinguish itself clearly? In conclusion, there was a pre- view of the conference of the Schoolof Spiritual Science of July 2-9, 2005,when the entire cycle of the 19 classlessons will be held in free rendering. Further Meetings Individual groupings had met earlier (the Swiss class holders, those fromthe north, and those of the romancelanguages). In addition, for the firsttime the collegium of the School cametogether with a circle of class holderswho, as contacts to the many cir cles of class holders that have for med worldwide, had been invited. In this way a stronger collaboration amongthe class holders, meanwhile number - ing 900, is being attempted. Heinz Zimmermann, GoetheanumAnthroposophy in the World Greater Effectiveness Meeting of Class Holders of the First Class of the School of Spiritual Science Mor e Concerted Agreements Motifs at the Conference of General Secretaries and the Meeting of Branch and Group Leaders At the convergence of the meeting of the general secretaries from November 9th to12th and that of the branch and group leaders from the 12th to the 14th, some cen-tral themes were common to both: leitmotifs of anthroposophical work, consultationon next year's theme-of-the-year and presentation of initiatives in the world Society. 4 Anthroposophy Worldwide 10/2004Inter change on the Theme of the Year The work with basic anthroposophi- cal motifs led to putting the futuretheme of the year, concerning'Michaelic culture', into concreteterms. This was the first time that thecoming theme of the year was thor-oughly deliberated at this meeting. The intention of the theme of the year continues to be to create a com-mon, consciously car ried content for the Anthroposophical Society. Manybranches have the need to know thetheme earlier, so that the branch pro-gram can make reference to it. The gen-eral feeling also emerged that the themeof the year should be deepened, withnuances, over a span of several years. Seed talks, workgroups on specif- ic themes and open conversation werethe work methods of both meetings.At the confer ence of general secre- taries, for example, the six workingareas of the General Section (study/-inner path/meditation, study of thehuman being, reincarnation and kar-ma, Christology and study of thehierarchies, social competence andquestions pertaining to time and evo-lution) were taken up in small groups. Sebastian J\u00fcngel Source: Bodo von Plato The Council of General Secretaries There exists within the framework of the General Anthroposophical Soci-ety the Council of General Secre-taries, which embraces the generalsecretaries of the national Societies,the members of the Executive Coun-cil, and the section leaders at theGoetheanum (referred to in what fol-lows as 'Council of General Secre-taries'). Appointment of General Secretaries and National Representatives If in any given country a national Society exists as a gr oup of the Gen- eral Anthr oposophical Society and consists of at least 500 members, it can, at the invitation of the Councilof General Secr etaries, delegate a gen - eral secretary to this Council. If there exists in a country a group of the General Anthr oposoph - ical Society and consisting of at least 50 members, it can, at the invitationof the Council of General Secr etaries, delegate a national representative to this Council. The naming of the general secre- taries and national representativestakes place at the suggestion of thenational Society and is confirmed bythe Executive Council at theGoetheanum in agr eement with the Council of General Secretaries. National Societies with more than 15,000 members can delegatetwo general secretaries. As a rule there is no substitution for general secr etaries on the Council of General Secretaries. Should it nev- ertheless be necessary to send a sub-stitute, this is to be arranged inadvance with the Executive Councilat the Goetheanum. The office of general secretary ceases:1. in the event of a resignation;2. if the majority of the members of the national Society are no longer inagreement with the general secretary; 3. if objection is raised by the leader- ship of the General Anthroposoph-ical Society. Tasks of the General Secretaries Rudolf Steiner's statement of Novem- ber 18, 1923 in Holland as well asthose of December 24 and 25, 1923 atthe Christmas Foundation Confer-ence on the subject of general secre-taries (see supplement) are valid nowas then, and are here summarized andsupplemented accor dingly under the following thr ee items: 1. The general secretaries represent the General AnthroposophicalSociety to the members of theirnational Societies. 2. The general secretaries and the national r epresentatives r epresent their national Societies to the lead- ership of the General Anthr opo- sophical Society . 3. The general secretary should be a person in his/her national Societywho is known and who is men-tioned when the Society is men-tioned. The Council of General Secretariesadvises on matters of the GeneralAnthr oposophical Society, in particu- lar the shaping of the anthroposophi- cal work worldwide and the annualgeneral meeting with its decisions andmotions. The Council of General Secre- taries obser ves membership develop- ment in the various countries and in the General Anthroposophical Soci-eties, and invites general secretariesand national representatives to worktogether in these countries as needed. At least twice a year the Council of General Secretaries is convened bythe Executive Council. The Executive Council sets the agenda, taking intoaccount the concerns and proposals ofthe members of the Council of Gen-eral Secretaries. The invitations tothese sessions shall be sent out at leastthree weeks prior to the sessions. Replacements on the Executive Council of the General Anthropo-sophical Society take place in consul-tation with the Council of GeneralSecretaries. The latter is as a rule alsoincluded in the event of replacementson the Collegium of the School ofSpiritual Science. The Council of General Secr e- taries can delegate cer tain tasks to individual members or to several of its members. This can be the case inparticular in any instance of exclusion of members from the General Anthroposophical Society. The gen-eral secr etary of the countr y in which a member's exclusion is at issue shall be included in the deliberations. Besides the r egular meetings of the Council of General Secretaries, the general secr etaries also meet in regional or thematic conferences. They report on these meetings to theother members of the Council ofGeneral Secretaries and provide forinforming the members of the Gener-al Anthr oposophical Society. Costs The costs incur red by sending general secretaries and national representa- tives to meet together are, as a rule,carried be the respective national Societies themselves.

The first meeting of Central Asian Waldorf initiatives in Kyrgyzstan was not organized by the'Friends of Rudolf Steiner's Art of Education' and the 'Finnish Anthroposophical Center'. The seminar was organized of the Gert Michail School, the Goethe-Gymnasium, the Nadjeshda Child Center and the central location forEducation Abroad (Germany). It was able to take place thanks to the support of the 'Finnish Anthroposophical Center'TAMMEC, the 'Friends of Rudolf Steiner's Art of Education' and IAO. We apologize for this mistake. Sebastian J\u00fcngel 5 Anthroposophy Worldwide 10/2004The audit was largely compiled with the guidance of Heiner Will from Soft-ware AG Stiftung und Herbert Meierfrom the Treuhandstelle, though manyothers were also involved in the actualanalysis. The process was guided bythe Executive Committee of theCouncil at the Goetheanum, althoughhere too over 25 coworkers were cen-trally involved in the process of reviewand analysis. In this sense it was acomprehensive and inclusive processfor the Goetheanum, shared by a fullyrepresentative cross section of the car-rying coworkers. Comments and concerns in the audit were diverse and focussed on 11major working areas and the Sectionsof the School of Spiritual Science.While each department and Sectionwas reviewed, and suggestions andanalysis given for improvement, therewere also several specific commentsmade in r elation to the Goetheanum as such. The analysis r estricted itself to the business operations of the Goetheanum to the extent possiblewithout wishing to comment on thesubstantive work and direction of theSociety, School or Goetheanum. The Goetheanum is in an impor - tant and difficult time. This expresses itself financially and as a r eflection of the need to r e-examine the develop- ments, vitality and growth of the Soci- ety worldwide. Rudolf Steiner clearlyhad a broad and profound imagina-tion for the role that the Anthropo-sophical Society could and shouldplay in the spiritual and social life ofhuman beings around the world. Thegrowth and innovations in the move- ment have considerably outpaced the Society in the last decades. This iscause for r eal concern. Furthermore, the multifaceted responsibilities of the Goetheanum as the center of theAnthr oposophical Society, as the seat of the School of Spiritual Science and as a major conference and performingarts center ( Mystery Dramas, Faust ) place on-going and significant finan-cial burdens on the Society. It is oftenoverlooked that we must care for overa dozen major buildings on an exten-sive 11-hectare 'campus'. Much of theinfrastructure needs urgent renewaland maintenance that is both costlyand critically necessary. Thus thefinancial restriction of ongoing costsand stable or decreasing income hasled to the necessity to look radically atchanges. The analysis raised questions about the urgent necessity of clear and deci-sive leadership in three major areas: 1)organization of a 'change process' within the Goetheanum and Society 2)creation of financial transparency, especially in expenditures 3)transparency (and evidence) in the 'added value' of the Society and theGoetheanum for the needs and ques-tions of individuals and organizations It was noted that the Goetheanum needs to unify, strengthen and concen-trate on its main or core tasks. Withso many diverse elements the overallimpact, resonance and reputation ofthe Goetheanum is unclear or evenconfusing. This needs to be consoli-dated, with a clearer, more evident andaccessible profile. At the same time wewish to recognize and foster morediversified and dif ferentiated leader- ship functions, and r ecognize that the Executive Council has specific responsibilities for the Goetheanumand the world Society , and that the Collegium also has responsibilities for the Goetheanum and the School ofSpiritual Science. These ar e new ways of working and we wish to find better ways to r eally communicate this to members so that we can move awayfrom older and less relevant para-digms to the r eality that the dif ferent leadership gremiums actually wish to promote. It is incumbent on the leadership to articulate, together with others, aperspective or leading image for thefutur e of the Anthroposophical Soci- ety. This is work which has begun, and will still take some time. Itincludes not only the coworkers at theGoetheanum, but General Secretaries,Group and Branch leaders, and manyothers invited to actively par ticipate in such discussions. The Executive Committee has articulated a response to the recom-mendations in the audit that includeareas of concern expressed in theaudit. Many of these steps havealready commenced and we wish toimplement others over the nextmonths. In no specific order of priori-ty they include: 1)Articulation and discussion of a leading image for the Society, theSchool of Spiritual Science and theGoetheanum2)Stimulation of a fundamental change process in the Society by formingnew initiatives regarding its develop-ment, and the promotion of an ini-tiative- and communication-network. 3)Overall concepts for study and train- ing opportunities at the Goethe-anum 4)Visitor/customer-oriented revision and restructuring of functional areasat the Goetheanum 5)Formation and presentation of a clear (public) profile for the Goetheanum 6)Optimization of financial trans- parency and coordination of relatedpolicies (such as the foundationgrant application process from theSections to foundations) 7)Better implementation of the leader- ship mandates and function-orien-tated responsibilities that have al-ready been delegated 8)Reorganization of the stage and confer ence organization 9)Development and implementation of job descriptions, annual work reviews and a salary structure for Goethe-anum coworkers We have summarized the areas where we need to impr ove and develop fur - ther clarity more broadly: a)The relationship of the many parts to the whole. How do they work together to incr ease the visibility and effectiveness of the totality? b)The relationship of esoteric and exoteric activities c)The relationship (and tension) of tradition and inheritance to a practi-cal and active r ealization of contem- porary needs and questions d)Leadership and clarity in coordina- tion of r esponsibilities It is beyond the scope of this arti- cle to list the detailed r ecommenda- tions and the responses and initiatives the Goetheanum has begun to imple-ment. From the restaurant to the stageto the real estate and buildings, to thefinances, to the archives, library andeach of the Sections we are underwayto optimize to the extent possible thelimited financial resources and opera-tional procedures of the Goetheanum. Cornelius Pietzner For the Executive CouncilOptimizing Limited Means Results and Consequences of the Business Audit at the Goetheanum On October 22, 2004 the Goetheanum Executive Council and members of the Collegium of the School of Spiritual Sciencemet with representatives of anthroposophicallly related foun-dations to review the final report of the foundations and theextensive commentary and response developed by the Goetheanum to the recommendations in the report (Anthro-posophy Worldwide no. 6, 2004, p. 7). This review meetingwas candid and fruitful. FRODE BARKVED was bor n on Sep - tember 17, 1961 in Ber gen and gr ew up in Stavanger. He graduated from the eur ythmy training at the Rudolf Steiner Seminar in J\u00e4r na in 1987. That same year he became a class teacher at the Rudolf Steiner Schoolin Stavanger . 1998 to 2002: council member of the Association of Nor- wegian W aldor f Schools. Class hol- der of the School of Spiritual Science. Since 2002 council member of theAnthroposophical Society in Nor-way, and since April of this year itsgeneral secr etary. Barkved is married and has two children. 6 Anthroposophy Worldwide 10/2004had to be consider ed with his wife. The two children are four and six years old, and it was clear from thebeginning that Barkved would keephis home in Stavanger. Oslo, with itsanthroposophical center 'Berle', is faraway . The new general secretary will have to do a lot of traveling. In order to create for itself a pic- ture of where renewal might be calledfor, the Norwegian council will soontake up the idea of having the newgeneral secretary, together with a fewother council members, visit all of theanthroposophical institutions in thecountry in the foreseeable future.\"Norway is a long, extended country,and there are many initiatives that Idon't yet know. I would like to meetall of them - of course only if theythemselves want this. We don't wantto intrude anywhere.\"Anthroposophy as a World Movement But the work of the general secretary is directed not only to the activities inone's own country. The worldwidecontacts are also part of it, especiallyto the Goetheanum, which for manyanthroposophists in Norway cansometimes seem quite far away. \"I cer-tainly don't see a contradiction inthis\", says Barkved. \"The totality is arhythmic unity, like breathing. Thework of the general secretary also hasto breathe in and breathe out.\" He is still now impressed by the meeting of general secretaries inBudapest ( Anthroposophy Worldwide no. 7, 2004, p. 8). \"It was very excit- ing. Not only because I got to knowso many inter esting people but also because it became so clear that there is nothing provincial about our work.Anthr oposophy is a world movement. And the inestimable significance of the Goetheanum is in its being a meet-ing place in this cosmopolitan field.Also at the last world teachers' con-ference ( Anthr oposophy Worldwide no. 4, 2004, p. 3) it was compelling to see how people from every cultureand all par ts of the world worked together. Then the Goetheanum is felt to be near and precious.\" Strengthening a Sense of Belonging Together Following a period at the end of the '90's when one looked mostly inwardand found things to never be goodenough, the activity of the Nor wegian Society today needs to be more clearly placed into the public domain. \"Ibelieve that we have to make an ef fort now so that the individual initiatives - schools, agricultural operations, cura-tive homes, individuals, etc. - reallycome together in a concerted move-ment, that we feel a stronger fellow-ship.\" To this end an 'extended coun-cil' is to be formed, with representa-tives of all of the initiatives. The accentis to be on that which is common toall, even though the Society consists ofonly 950 members. \"We should actual-ly be at least 5,000. Our challenge is tobe a totally public Society to whicheveryone wants to belong who feelsinspired by anthroposophy.\"If there is a typical element in Frode Barkved's life, it is the motif of suddentransition. Already his entry into theworld of anthroposophy took placewithout much hesitation. On seeing apicture of Rudolf Steiner for the firsttime, he said 'That's him'. Half a yearlater he was a student at the RudolfSteiner Seminar in J\u00e4rna, Sweden. \"I had barely finished the training when I received a call from Stavanger,my home town. They wanted to haveme as a class teacher at the Waldorfschool there\", recounts Barkved. \"Ifelt right away that this was the rightthing.\" It was only a year until hethen took on a leading role on the fac-ulty. This too seems to be typical forhis life: After it has suddenly taken asurprising tur n, he takes on a central position in the new setting. He is still a class teacher, but also a eurythmistand drama teacher at the same school.From 1998 to 2002 he was on theboard of the Association of Norwe-gian W aldor f Schools. A new direction came about with the question of becoming a member ofthe School of Spiritual Science. \"Ofcourse I did not feel at all matureenough for such a step\", says Barkved.\"But then I was reading Steiner's kar-ma lectures. When I got to the descrip-tion of the School of Char tres, it was morning, and, in a double sense, it became totally light around me. Afterthat I r equested a conversation con- cerning admission to the School.\" Two years later he took on the responsibili-ty for the work of the First Class inStavanger. Since 2002 he has also beena member of the Council of theAnthr oposophical Society in Norway. Getting to Know the Initiatives The question whether he wanted to become general secretary of the Nor-wegian national Society, however, cer-tainly brought on some mighty heartpalpitations. \"In such an instance, onehas to quietly ponder the answer.Even though the heart replied rightaway and I felt somehow 'touched', itwas not an easy decision. This was notsomething that had ever occurred tome, at least not in day-consciousness\". It took a month before he came to a decision, since the question naturally'Delight and Joy are Liberating for Life Forces' Frode Barkved is the New General Secretary of the Norwegian Society Since April of this year, Frode Barkved has been General Secretary of the Anthroposophical Society in Norway. Hesucceeds Margrethe Solstad (Anthroposophy Worldwide no.1, 2002, p. 8), who has stepped back after seven years of ser-vice in order to give herself more fully to her work with theeurythmy training and the eurythmy ensemble in Oslo (Anthroposophy Worldwide no. 2, 2003, p. 7). The new gen-eral secretary has plans to visit all of the country's anthropo-sophical initiatives in the near future. Anthroposophical Society Photos: J\u00fcr gen V ater7 Anthroposophy Worldwide 10/2004The level of intellectual debate in Norway is traditionally very high.Almost from the beginning, leadinganthroposophists were at the sametime persons known in public life.This was the case, already in Steiner'stime, for the notable author IngeborgM\u00f6ller or for Henrik Ibsen's son Sig-urd, who was one of the first Norwe-gian defenders of the idea of socialthreefolding. Among the well-known personal- ities who represent the anthroposoph-ical cause in Norwegian public life isthe journalist and author Peter Nor-mann Waage. \"When his first book onIslam was being discussed in themedia, the renowned philosopherTrond Berg Barkved, laughing.Incidentally, the German translationof the book has just come out. Criticism From Inside Given the distinguished journalists, either within or in the vicinity of theAnthroposophical Society, one doesnot have to wait in Norway for criti-sism to come from outside. Most crit-icism here comes from within. WriterKaj Skagen represents one of the mostrecent examples. In a vehement 17- page ar ticle in the publication Steiner - skolen , he draws his sword on things becoming stale within the Waldorfschool movement. \"W e should take this kind of criticism like a shot of vit- amins, as a welcome contribution, inorder to lear n from it\", says Barkved. \"It would be catastrophic if we would isolate or exclude these voices. T o the contrar y: they can guide us onward. In other issues too we should perhaps rather bring out our criticisms fr om within, before others put the item on the agenda.\" At the same time one cannot let oneself be incapacitated by criticism,but should ask oneself in all calmness:What is adequate and what is not? \"It' s easy to throw out the baby with the bath water. Yet there is plenty ofapplied anthr o- posophy that has a fruitful and cre-ative ef fect in the present.\" As an example of thisBarkved tells of aperformance of The Magic Flute in the Grieg Hall in Bergen, given by thelocal Waldorf school - an artistic bee-line right into the broader public. Peo-ple were beside themselves withenthusiasm and asked how somethinglike this is possible at a school. Even though anthroposophically inspired ideas do reach into the Nor-wegian public from time to time, theAnthroposophical Society as suchdoesn't figure in the general discussionof things. \"We have begun preparing a big exhibit for 2008, a hundred yearsafter Steiner's first lecture in Norway.The Society and the School will clearlycome to the fore, together with all ofthe initiatives that have arisen out ofanthroposophy. It's about connectingthe inner aspect of anthroposophywith the wider public.\" What is 'Norwegian'? Nature and light are among the things that are generally felt to be 'typically'Norwegian. But Barkved does notparticularly like to speak of 'typical' elements because one quickly ends up enumerating clich\u00e9s. \"The differenceswithin the country itself are quiteconsiderable\", he says. \"The markedlyvaried nature circumstances come toexpression in varying dialects andsocial behavior . What' s ther e to con- sider 'typically Norwegian'\"? And yet ther e are developments that have not tur ned up in the same way in other countries. Norwegian gover nment finance is characterized by the globally almost unique circum- stance that there is no debt of anykind. The pr esence of oil in the Nor th Sea, especially off the coast of Barkved's hometown of Stavanger, hasgiven rise to enor mous prosperity in a relatively short time. \"The enormous proceeds are stashed in some foreign accounts some - where, and the people are asthough numbedby it. Oneneeds somebackbone to wield such prosperity. And I wouldwish that more funds from the busi-ness world would be injected into thecultural life in order to have anenlivening effect there. If conscious-ness for this would awaken, some-thing positive could come about fromthis economic strength. The council of the Norwegian Society is currently working with oth-ers on the project 'The School ofNature', approaching the existentialquestion with which many people, especially younger people, live today:the theme of the human being andnature ( Anthroposophy Worldwide no. 8, 2004). \"We don't want this to con-cern only our own country, but ratherwhat is 'Norwegian' to wake up andbecome something cosmopolitan. Forthis reason the classes take place inEnglish, and we alternate betweenpartly 'wild' nature experiences in theinterior of the country and a morestudy-oriented stay in Dornach.When what is particular to a countryis not connected to what is cos - mopolitan, it appears, in the best sce - nario, as something antiquated, and in the worst case as chauvinistic - justsimply 'typical'. W e must get fr om what is typical to what is universal. Then things begin to pulsate.\" In par ts of the countr y that ar e not yet so strongly urbanized, there are still distinct nature forces. It is a component of the Nor wegian task to take hold of these forces and send them as an impulse in an outwar d direction. But Barkved prefers in this regard to speak of Scandinavian ratherthan Nor wegian impulses. \"The northern quality has a mobility to it, a certain freshness in thinking that wecan per haps also bring into the inter- national anthroposophical work. We're not so burdened by the heavi-ness of knowledge. But of course werun the danger of having too much ofthis mobility and dissipating. Andthen things ar en't serious anymore.\" Barkved's personal relationship to anthroposophy is marked by earnestwork, but also by humor, spontaneityand creative joy. \"No one wants toassert that anthroposophy is some-thing easy. But I find that workingwith anthroposophy should also havea joyful accent and not be taken as aburdensome duty. We can't forget thatit's often delightful to overcome list-lessness. And besides: Joy is conta-gious. It frees up life forces that canbecome fruitful in the world.\" J\u00fcrgen Vater, J\u00e4rna (Sweden) His relationship to anthropo- sophy is marked by earnest work, but also by humor, spontaneity and creative joy: Frode Barkved \"We should take this kind of criti - cism like a shot of vitamins, as a welcome contribution, in or der to learn from it.\"8 Anthroposophy Worldwide 10/2004'Material in the wrong place' - this is the definition of dirt. So the mandateof cleaning personnel is: moving mate-rial around. No? Does cleaning meanmore than this? What is altogether'the wrong place'? Why is it that thefecund garden soil, which I enjoyedjust a moment ago, is now - on myliving room carpet - suddenly a stub-born challenger? These were the kinds of questions that launched the first specialty con-ference in the world on cleaning cul-ture. It paid off that the organizers putstakes on brief presentations. Witheach one, things became more andmore gripping. The theme 'cleaning'gained in breadth and depth withoutlosing any footing. The varied contri-butions were lightened and enrichedby little cabaret-inserts all about clean-ing, ther eby processing in a witty and intelligent way something that was sometimes said just a moment ago. The only thing in short supply were the br eaks - not because things wer e too long-winded, but because one hardly found enough time to see the excitingexhibits of the dif ferent envir onmentally conscious developers and manufacturers of washing and cleaning parapher nalia, not to mention to be intr oduced to the products and concepts by all of the com- petent consultants. One of the high points of the conference was the contribution ofcomedian Ursus W ehrli. Inge van der Ploeg had introduced us to the art of tidying up, and now Urs Wehrli to thetidying up of ar t. From Cleaning to Caring A high point of another kind was the lecture by Linda Thomas. She depict-ed a kind of taking care of a roomwhich does not just deal with materialin the wrong place, but which reallytends to the space. I would sum up what for me was the most essentialpart of the lecture in my own formu-lation as follows: A space wants notmerely to be freed of filth, but also tobe created anew as a space for people,for something to happen. What comes about in the process of cleaning, or does not come about,or is destroyed, depends very much onour attitude. We have to understandour field, pay attention to our outerbearing, and move in a conscious andhealthy way, so that cleaning doesn'tmake us ill. An unhealthy inner atti-tude toward cleaning can also lead toillness - and perhaps not only for usbut also for the place in question. AmI cleaning 'like the devil' or caring andtending 'like an angel'? Linda Thomasimpressively portrayed how she had tofirst develop a practice of a healthyinner attitude, in accor dance with the motto 'If you cannot do what you love, then learn to love what you do' -until this became a necessity and in theend transformed into joy. One does not tire of listening to Linda Thomas when she tells of herexperiences in pedagogical institutions,and one can be deeply shaken at whatan unbelievably healing ef fect such an attitude to this kind of caring mainte- nance can have on the sur roundings. A Contribution to Outreach I believe that anyone who experienced this conference in its manifoldness willnot soon forget these three days. Theywere also an important contribution to the wider world: the participants who were barely acquainted with anthropos-ophy befor ehand were visibly surprised that 'spiritualized anthroposophists' strove for a comprehensive approach tothis seemingly ofane field. David Lorentzen, Dornach, SwitzerlandANTHROPOSOPHICAL SOCIETY INESTONIA Harmonious Composition The Anthroposophical Society in Estonia is 80 Years Old On September 23rd the 80th anniver- sary of the Estonian Society was cele-brated in one of the medieval buildingson the town hall square in Tallinn. The month of September 1924 saw the enormous culmination and at the sametime the end of Rudolf Steiner's lectur-ing activity. The Lectures of Rudolf Steiner by Hans Schmidt [not available in English] reports 73 lectures, address-es and consultations up until the 24thof the month. This all came to an endon September 28th with The Last Address - the sudden conclusion of Rudolf Steiner's activity, insofar as thisconsisted of verbal communication. Far away from this strong activity in Dornach, the newly founded Anthro-posophical Society in Estonia was con-firmed. At a gathering on June 15 some30 members had decided on the found-ing of an Estonian AnthroposophicalSociety. This day can in a sense thus bedesignated as the birthday. This thenreceived official recognition by the public authorities on September 24th, making this a birthday too. A beautifulanniversary celebration took place nowon September 25th. Anthroposophical work in Estonia continued uninterrupted throughoutall these years, which was, however , not officially possible during the time of communism. Anthr oposophists too had to go to Siberia - this could har dly have been otherwise under the circum- stances of the time - but they wer e not bothered as anthroposophists. The anniversary celebration was composed har moniously , encompass- ing festive addresses, music, and eury- thmy, and interspersed with readingsof shor t passages by Rudolf Steiner. Vaige Salum, now among the elders, reported on the history of anthropos-ophy in Estonia, and Mar garetha Habekost on the eurythmy work. Just a few days before the celebra- tion a book in the Estonian languagecame out, of which it can be hopedthat it will receive recognition: The Estonian National Epic Kalevipoeg , with an anthroposophically inspiredinterpretation by author Sirje Purga. And thirdly, what also took place during this time was that the anthropo-sophical group in Tallinn acquired itsown habitat - small and in need of reno-vation - in N\u00f5mme, a richly forestedsuburb of Tallin. - As someone who hasbeen connected to the work in Estoniasince 1966, I was able to take part in thisanniversary celebration. Oskar Borgman Hansen, \u00c5rhus, DenmarkOn Cleaning Devils and Cleaning Angels First Worldwide Cleaning Conference: October 29-31, 2004 at the Goetheanum Some 200 participants came from 14 nations and from the most varied fields. Besides a panel discussion on creative hygiene, there were also many workshops to deepen themany themes broached. Whether the theme was the development of cleaning con-cepts, a phenomenology of cleaning or recognition of elemental beings in the cleaningprocess, the conference as a whole was about creating a space anew through cleaning.Anthroposophy in the World The tidied room in Vincent van Gogh's painting may be self-defeating.

Particularly thelast contributions left the audiencewith a deep impression because theyshowed how modern spirituality canwork into the transformation of theearth. There was of course opportunity in the discussion groups to deepenthese lecture themes, to ask questionsand to come into conversation. Andthere were questions aplenty, since formany participants this was the firsttime they hear d about anthropos-ophy and RudolfSteiner. A very and Abbaya. In the evenings there were cultur- al programs. Seven of the participantswere eurythmists. Together they pre-sented the Hallelujah occasion one of the schoolmothers Kuchipudi dance.This dance style comes from the stateof Andhra, of which Hyderabad is thecapital. The next evening there was aBharat-Natyam dance performance.There are eight classical dance stylesin India - all very old and always con-nected with religion. Important for India and for Anthr oposophy After the confer ence ther e wer e still two days of 'Waldorf Round Table' in Sloka, organized by Nana G\u00f6bel of'Friends of Rudolf Steiner 's Ar t of Education'. This gathering was direct- ed first and foremost to people fromthe W aldor f school movement in Asia. On heard participants' reports on how the W aldorf schools and teacher trainings in the dif ferent Asian coun- tries are doing. Many typical aspects of W aldor f pedagogy wer e spoken about, such as the fact that the cur- riculum has to suit the cultural, lin-guistic and historical conditions.Finances were also discussed. After nine days the conference was over, but many of us could not yet travel home since at the 'Friends of Camphill India' near Bangalore (inKarnatake, southern India) there was still a three-day course in curative edu- cation and in Hyder- abad was very important for the fur-ther development of anthroposophy inIndia and for making India known inthe anthroposophical world. One seesthat everywhere in the world there arepeople who are striving for knowledge,who represent the consciousness souland who are seeking a new world view.In India this seems to lead over espe-cially into practical initiatives. Andspiritual wisdom is there in any case. Aban Bana, Bombay, India Ulrich R\u00f6sch, Dornach, SwitzerlandThe twin cities Hyderabad and Secunderabad lie in the heart of India'sDeccan plateau. They are a center forthe traditions of the Islamic north andthe Hindu south. The Sloka WaldorfSchool, the first Waldorf school on thesubcontinent of India, has had itshome in Hyderabad since 1997. Sincethe founding of Sloka, further Waldorfand Waldorf-inspired schools havecome into being in these twin cities. Nirmala Diaz, founder of Sloka, and Ulrich R\u00f6sch of the Social ScienceSection of the School of Spiritual Sci-ence at the Goetheanum prepared theconference together. The teachers, co- workers and par ents of Sloka pr ovided a feat of energetic support, thereby giv- ing a particular flair to the whole con-ference. The typically Indian reception for the delegates from Asia and the Pacific was unique: rangoli pictures onthe gr ound, flowers, lights, silk, song and dance - and of course food. Color ful Schedule The first two days were reserved for the Asia-Pacific Initiative Group dele-gates from India, Australia, theGoetheanum, Japan, New Zealand,Pakistan, the Phillipines, Taiwan, theU.S and Vietnam. The actual confer-ence proper began on October 29thwith some 200 participants. The dele-gates were now joined by representa-tives from Hong Kong, Nepal, Singa-pore and numerous participants fromIndia. They were received by theteachers and pupils of Sloka singingsongs of welcome. Every morning there was a classTypically Indian 6th Asian-Pacific Conference and 1st Goetheanum Conference in Hyderabad The conference from October 29 to November 2, 2004 in Hyderabad was a co-pro- duction of the Asia-Pacific Conference, which has been taking place since 1996, andthe first Goetheanum Conference in India. The latter was initiated two years ago byIndian farmer Chelladurai Jayakaran. Indian farmers working biodynamicallyhave had the wish to be more closely connected to the Goetheanum. For the firsttime members of the executive council of the General Anthroposophical Society werepresent at an anthroposophical event in India: Paul Mackay and Cornelius Pietzner.India A color ful audience listens to the lecture by Nirmala Diaz Co-or ganizer Nirmala starting point was Est\u00e2ncia through which the biody-namic agricultural method was to takehold in Brazil. It became necessary toestablish a research base and an insti-tute was founded for this purpose. Inorder to protect the land from toxinsused in the surrounding area, varioussettlements arose where a few hun-dred people live today. This led to a Waldorf school that today encompasses 16 classes fromkindergarten to high school (withapproximately 30 students per class,of which 48% attend free of charge).Of course we also have a branch ofthe Anthroposophical Society and themost varied scientific and artisticwork groups as well as foundationcourses and consulting for biodynam-ic agriculture. In addition, there is ablossoming Christian Communitywith a very beautiful church. One can at this point ask: Ar e these all anthroposophists who live here? Do they all have membershipcards for the Anthroposophical Soci- ety or the School of Spiritual Science? And if one does have the card, is onean anthr oposophist? Is all of this, strictly speaking, anthroposophical? Taken abstractly and theoretically,certainly not. But what does life say about this? The world of plants and animals without doubt rejoices at their exis-tence. Pages could be written report-ing this. And people? Yes, once theyare here, they hardly want to leave.Our children too wish to set up theirlives here, without all of the dangersof big cities. The 30th anniversary fell at the same time as Brazil's fourth Biody-namic Agricultural Conference, heldevery two years, and the 80th anniver-sary of Rudolf Steiner's Agricultural Course . This time we especially wantedto again invite many farmers working biodynamically, so the costs had to bekept as low as possible. Several hun-dred people from the north and southof the country registered to come. Many Human Encounters The municipality , with which we enjoy quite a good standing, made two large tents available. Other agen-cies of the federal governmentdefrayed the costs of the posters andfolders. Both large- and small-scalefarmers brought along Demeter prod-ucts, fr om rice and beans to fr uit and vegetables to herbs, teas and coffee. Est\u00e2ncia Dem\u00e9tria donated milk andmeat. In r egard to only the salt, I can- not say if it was also Demeter, but it was cer tainly r eal sea salt. Also eco - logically friendly toiletries and bath items were not forgotten.... The many human meetings wer e lovely at this giant 'ant hill', through- out which many children also flew likecolor ful butterflies. Many a mother stressed that, had she known that this is how it would be, she would havebrought her children along. The program was may-sided: The Waldorf school opened its doors,there were various tours - partly with scenic accents, partly with an agricul- tural and botanical accent - also shortcourses on different themes concern-ing biodynamic agriculture and land-scaping, astronomy and community.Then there were also gatherings ofteachers and farmers to share experi-ences and get to know each other. Forthe 'Gem\u00fct' and for soul preparationthere was a musical Indian religiousservice with all sorts of percussioninstruments, and otherwise also lots ofsinging, a theatre performance aboutwheat sprouts and of course also apeasants dance and even a carnivalparade to close. It was all ver y uncon- strained and tropically dionysian. Neutralized Property But also the apollonian element came into its own. Nicholai Fuchs, leader ofthe Agricultural Section at theGoetheanum, held three lectures onlast year's and this year's themes of theyear. Attila Miklos spoke about thesignificance of Demeter nutrition forhuman in regard to theChrist Being. Christian Communitypriest Renato Gomes gave a well-received talk on the theme The Human Being Between Past andFuture , and Flavio Milanese spoke on human development in the biographyof each individual - a lecture thatshowed us that the world of ideas canbe accessible to each one of us today. The high point of the festivities was already right at the beginning inthe conversation on the neutralizationof land ownership. Peter Schmidtshared here a story from his life.Already in the 1930's his motherdeveloped a biodynamic garden.When the Schmidt family, owner ofthe furniture factory 'Giroflex', decid-ed to buy the land for Est\u00e2nciaDem\u00e9tris, Schmidt drew attention tothe need to deal with pr otecting it from changes to its intended use: to develop biodynamic agriculture in Brazil. The Schmidt family decided unanimously to write over the owner - ship to the Tobias Association (an institution that offers legal protectionand financial suppor t for other anthroposophical endeavors as well). This is what made possible, materiallyspeaking, the sur vival of all those who so cheerfully came together - in spite of all of the crises and mistakes of thepast 30 years. Looking back now, it can indis- putably be experienced that anthro-posophy lives - in the whole country.For people indeed came here veryspontaneously from north, south, eastand Bernardo Thomas Sixel, S\u00e3o Paolo (Brazil) Contact: thomas.sixel@biodinamica.org.br www.biodinamica.org.brAnthroposophy is Alive 30 years of Biodynamic Activity in the State of S\u00e3o Paolo In the heart of the state of S\u00e3o Paolo in Brazil, some 300 kilometers west of the coast, is the town of Botucatu.

Indeed, this bir th is our call- ing as human beings. In Jesus, theLogos entered not merely as imagebut as the actual power of Love,becoming available for all humanbeings and for the life of nature. Beth Usher spoke about Occult Physiology: Blood and the AwakeningEgo. Saturn still exists within us today as the warmth of our blood. The circu-lation of the blood appeared when thewarmth ether united with the outerwarmth of the physical Earth. The ego,which first entered man when he began to breathe air, works in the circulating blood by way of the warmth organism.In the Fall from Paradise, the humanbeing left the life of his nervous systembehind in the cosmos. The Christbrought this life from the cosmos backto the human being, beginning at theBaptism. Life r eturned, though not to the ner vous system but to the blood. Embryology shows that on the nineteenth day the blood begins tomove. This is the first quickening bythe incarnating ego. The heart formslater out of the moving blood. RudolfSteiner speaks of blood as the r eal issue in the fight of an individual soul between good and evil. Thinking thewrong thoughts about the heart materi- alizes culture as well as the heart. Moral ideals stimulate the war mth or ganism, producing in the air organism sources of light. By way of warmth, all that weinwar dly experience as the moral becomes active. By returning through the moral to warmth, we come full cir-cle to the blood war mth from Saturn. This is a new way to think of the circu- lation of the blood. Beth Usher gave a beautiful eur yth- my performances of The Zend Avesta Hymn to the Sun and The Michael Imag- ination , as well as two eur ythmy lessons. The 47 participants came from as far as California, North Carolina andCanada as well as from the mid-Atlanticand New England areas.

We are able to performour outer duties andactivities and let every-thing that we developspiritually flow into thephysical plane. By devel-oping a high degree ofstrong and living think-ing on this path, we candirect this thinkingtoward our perceptionsin the spiritual world. When we are ready to enter the spiritual world we meet two guardians.The Lesser Guardian of the Threshold ismostly made up of the results of ourown past actions, feelings andthoughts. After we have recognized inthis being the things from which weneed to fr ee ourselves, we meet the Greater Guar dian of the Thr eshold. If we can inwardly feel that the Greater Guardian is the ideal toward which westrive, then we r ecognize that the Greater Guardian is the Christ. New Bir th Follows Disillusionment How Can I Find the Christ in and for Myself? was the subject of Sher ry Wildfeuer's talk. She acknowledged that the rejection of Christianity so common to spiritually striving youngpeople today is a healthy reaction tothe popular versions distorted by sen-timentality , dogmatic morality , or aca- demic materialism. She shared her own path to agnosticism as a youngperson, which was intellectually liber - ating but lacked substance which could provide nourishment andinsight in the face of life' s trials. It was a great relief to meet anthroposophy, insofar as Rudolf Steiner lays a foun-dation in his philosophical writings byaddressing the question How can I know anything for sure? We may ask: What are the perceptions to which I must apply my active thinking in orderto know the truth of Christ? And What thoughts will enable me to per- ceive Christ in myself? The ancient mystery centers taught that the Father God had sacri-ficed himself into the things of themanifest world, that the Motherdwells in the deep longing of the soulto unite with the divine, and that theSon of God, or Logos, can be born inthe human soul through the union ofIn the opening lecture Steve Usher pre- sented an overview of Rudolf Steiner'slectures on the Gospel of St. Luke. Hebegan with the observation that it isdifficult to speak of Christianity in ourtime because civilization has developedenormous prejudices toward it. Earliermaterialistic scholarship propoundsideas such as there never having been ahistorical Jesus or alternatively that asimple man of Nazareth captured thephantasy of the next 2,000 years. Morerecent prejudices see Christianity as thereligion of closed minded right-wingpeople or as the tradition that created adisregard for the environment and awill to dominate the world. It is mucheasier to speak to a spiritually mindedaudience about Buddhism than aboutChristianity. The lecturer presented that a cen- tral concept of esoteric Christianity isthat at the Baptism in the Jor dan a solar being, a being fr om the Sun known as the Christ, united Himself with the body of Jesus of Nazareth.For the next thr ee years this solar being lived upon the earth as a human being. Those three years are rightlyunderstood as His embr yological peri - od. At the mystery of Golgotha, when Jesus Christ died on the cr oss, the Christ was bor n into the earth and since then He has been the Spirit of the Earth who will r emain with human beings for the rest of earth evolution. A further consideration was that Christbrought the power of love to the ego such that the ego could overflow with love. Love existed before but only atthe level of the astral body and soul.Christ made it possible for love tobecome a possession of the ego. Union with the Christ Els Woutersen spoke about the Christ and inner development. The Gospelsof St. Luke and St. John were writtenout of different levels of perceptioninto the supersensible world. Whereasthe eyewitnesses and ministers or ser-vants of the Word wrote the LukeGospel, the John Gospel describes themysteries of Christ as imbued withthe inner Word or Logos. The old Christian path of initia- tion was based on the Gospel of St.John whereby after intense prepara-tion one would develop certain feel-ings to a very high degree and experi-ence the seven different stages ofChristian initiation.Call to the Human Being Youth Conference: An Introduction to Rudolf Steiner's Spiritual Scientific Research into the Nature of Christianity, October 9-10 at Heartbeet Life-sharing, in Hardwick, Vermont Heartbeet is a biodynamic farm providing respite and a permanent resi- dence for developmentally disabled individuals, and managed by HannahSchwartz and Jonathan Gilbert.USA 12 Anthroposophy Worldwide 10/2004Spiritual Seeds in Elemental Nature Unexpected Footprints of the Biodynamic Work in Estonia: Alexander von Keyserlingk We had the privilege of staying overnight in the station's guesthouse, which, incidentally, is also open to oth-er gr oups who r egister in advance. In the middle of the forest, which over half a century ago was still a well-tended park, we discover ed, in a light- filled clearing, the world's first Schiller memorial, commissioned by a Schillerenthusiast in 1813. W e couldn't help singing the first lines of the Ode to Joy . The small cr est that extends out to the tip of the peninsula is surrounded on both sides by a broad stretch ofreeds. In the above-mentioned natur e preserve we experienced such elemental nature as is hard to come upon innorthern Europe. No travel guide described the extensive juniper forests and rowan trees, considered sacred inthe nor th. The forests stretched to the horizon and lent to the landscape something archaic. It is no wonder thatprehistoric gravesites were discovered not far from here, including treasures from the Volga region. From Silesia to Estonia The life of Count Keyserlingk is indeed closely connected to the developmentof biodynamic agriculture. Right afterthe Christmas Conference in Dornachin 1923/1924, he asked when RudolfSteiner could come to Koberwitz inSilesia to give a course on agriculture.In response to this question, RudolfSteiner pulled out his calendar andpromptly agreed to come. Thus atWhitsun 1924 the course that laterAt the beginning of 2004 when my wife and I were in Estonia, special experi-ences came our way, both expected andunexpected. After a boat trip on therough Baltic Sea, we went into Tallinn.The occasion for the trip was, to beginwith, the opening of my exhibit ofaquarelles based on the Estonian epic Kalevipoeg . The exhibit in the monu- mental National Library of Estonia'scapital was under the umbrella ofCarsten Vilms, the cultural attach\u00e9 ofthe German embassy in Tallinn. Somuch on the expected travel experience. The unexpected part first devel- oped in Estonia itself. Arvo Purga,brother-in-law of the Kalevipoeg re- searcher Sirje Purga, has been involvedin biodynamic agriculture for decades.He accompanied us to one of the far-flung corners in the west of Estoniaacross from the island Saaremaa, for- merly \u00d6sel. During our drive, rain and the most unusual cloud formations of thestrangest kind sent their gr eetings fr om Sweden over the Baltic Sea. It became increasingly desolate, and we were sim-ply oblivious to the first r oad sign say - ing 'Natural Preserve'. Shortly there- after was a - tion'. An insur mountable wire-grid fence finally made us come to a stop. Proceeding thr ough an unlocked entrance door, Arvo Purga made his way to inquire. Soon thereafter he reap-peared and led us to a stand of timber: Through the green leaves came the shining red shimmer of the newly tiledroof of a building. Schiller Monument in the Forest We stood in front of the legendary house of the family of Count Alexan- der von Keyserlingk (1895-1995).Shor tly thereafter Mart appeared, a young man with a backpack who lives here with his family on weekends andin the holidays. He is now inspectingthe renovation of the property. After examining the Keyserlingk house, Mart guides us to the tip of thepeninsula Puhtu, where the biologyresearch institute of Tartu University isfound. Biology students often come hereto study the flora and fauna. For manyyears the world-renowned biologist andresearcher Jacob von Uexk\u00fcll (1864-1944), with whom Keyserlingk was ongood neighborly terms from 1934 to1939, worked at the station here.Feature The beginnings of biodynamic agriculture in Estonia can be followed back to the source of the impulse. Count vonKeyserlingk carried this impulse at the time directly fromRudolf Steiner's Agricultural Course in what was thenSilesia into the small country on the Baltic Sea. Still today this initiative calls forth fruits, although the dimensions ofthe biodynamic work in Estonia are modest. - Impressionsof a journey through an archaic landscape. became known as simply the Agricul - tural Course could take place. After this event, von Keyserlingk worked on far ms in Silesia and Estonia. But the biodynamic method was not able, after the initial attempts, to cometo r ealization over such enor mous areas. As Ines and Dagmar, the count's daughters, confir med, the father of the spiritual 'estate' that he had r eceived in Koberwitz, was not able to 'bring it down to the gr ound'. And yet the spir - itual seed has not been lost. Eighty years after the beginning of the biody-namic impulse, one can feel this mostdeeply. After the Second World War and later the fall of the ir on curtain, Gott- fried Geiger and farmers from Sweden, with the support of Manfred Klett,were able to begin with the new method on countless farmsteads in Estonia and Latvia. As we heard fromArvo Purga in Tallhinn, the farms, mostly small, do not have it easy. Yet it is to be hoped that biodynamic farmingand gardening will continue to developwell, also after Estonia joins the Euro-pean Union. Von Keyserlingk had the opportu- nity after World War II to practice bio-dynamics on a much smaller scale inRaubling, near Munich. Here he couldpass on his experience and knowledgeto biodynamic farmers in Chiemgau,bringing much blessing to their work.
