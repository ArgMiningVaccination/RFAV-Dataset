They are difficult to study because of the complex interplay of 20 distinct glycosyltransferase isoenzymes that initiate this form of glycosylation, the polypeptide GalNAc transferases (GalNAc-Ts). Despite proven disease relevance, correlating the activity of individual GalNAc-Ts with biological function remains challenging due to a lack of tools to probe their substrate specificity in a complex biological environment. Here, we develop a \"bump-hole\" chemical reporter system for studying GalNAc-T activity in vitro. Individual GalNAc-Ts were rationally engineered to contain an enlarged active site (hole) and probed with a newly-synthesized collection of 20 (bumped) UDP-GalNAc analogs to identify enzyme-substrate pairs that retain peptide specificities but are otherwise completely orthogonal to native enzyme-substrate pairs. The approach was applicable to multiple GalNAc-T isoenzymes, including GalNAc-T1 and -T2 that GalNAcT-10 that prefers pre-glycosylated A detailed investigation of enzyme kinetics and specificities revealed the robustness of the approach to faithfully report on GalNAc-T activity and paves the way for studying substrate specificities in living systems. Introduction Glycosylation with O-linked -GalNAc (historically called mucin-type O-glycosylation) is one of the most abundant forms of post-translational modification in higher eukaryotes1 and is essential for normal embryonic development,2 and metabolic glycosylation are associated tumor O-GalNAc glycosylation, the polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyl transferases (GalNAc-Ts), are differentially regulated, and their expression has been associated with various disease states.6-9 The human genome encodes 20 GalNAc-T paralogs, constituting one of the largest and arguably most complex glycosyltransferase families.10 GalNAc-Ts are membrane-associated, type II Golgi-resident enzymes with adjacent catalytic and lectin domains that face the Golgi lumen. Some isoenzymes seem to share functional redundancies, as reflected in subtle animal knockout phenotypes,11,12 whereas others are essential for viability or specific organ functions.2,13 O-GalNAc glycans frequently decorate proteins in clusters called mucin glycodomains.14 These densely glycosylated sequences are built to existing O-GalNAc glycans.10,15 The substrate specificities of the various isoenzymes collectively create an O-GalNAc glycoproteome with discrete biological consequences. Despite their participation in many facets of human biology, our understanding of GalNAc-T substrate selection is limited. GalNAc-Ts transfer a GalNAc residue from the nucleotide sugar donor UDP-GalNAc to the hydroxyl groups of Ser, Thr, and possibly Tyr residues of proteins in the secretory pathway and supposedly the nucleus.16,17 The protein substrates and specific glycosylation sites modified by individual GalNAc-Ts are not well described, hampering our understanding of their biological function and disease causality. Classical genetic approaches toward understanding GalNAc-T function are complicated by protein substrate redundancies and the existence of overlapping protein target sites.12,18 More targeted genetic studies have validated roles for GalNAc-T2 heterotaxy, associated with congenital heart disease.13 Despite these forays, the primary source of information about specific amino acid preferences of individual GalNAc-Ts is still the performance of in vitro assays with peptide substrates.20-22 Clausen and co-workers made a major breakthrough to discern GalNAc-T substrate specificity using cell lines engineered to generate truncated O-GalNAc glycoproteins with limited glycan elaborations.23 Glycoproteomics analyses of so-called SimpleCells - with and without a single GalNAc-T knockout - identified isoenzyme-specific glycosylated proteins and sites.18,24,25 However, given the interdependencies and substrate redundancies of various GalNAc-Ts, this loss of function approach may not generalize across the enzyme family. Furthermore, late GalNAc-Ts have not been addressed by the SimpleCell approach yet. So far, no method is available to probe the function of an individual GalNAc-T isoenzyme in the presence of others without the drawbacks associated with genetic knockouts. We envisioned a complementary approach in which individual GalNAc-T isoenzymes are engineered to acquire a gain of function - the ability to mark their specific protein substrates and glycosites with a chemical handle. This has been achieved with other enzyme families, including kinases,26,27 acetyltransferases,28 methyltransferases,29 and ADP-ribosyltransferases,30 using the \"bump-hole\" engineering strategy.31 Key to this strategy is the identification of gatekeeper residues that can be mutated to alter the active site so as to accommodate a complementary substrate. Critically, the \"bumped\" substrate should not be recognized by native members of the enzyme family. There are examples wherein the active sites of individual glycosyltransferases were mutated to accommodate modified nucleotide-sugars bearing chemical handles.32-34 However, to the best of our knowledge, glycosyltransferase enzyme families have not yet been subjects of orthogonal enzyme-substrate engineering. Here, we report a strategy for engineering orthogonal GalNAc-T and UDP-sugar pairs that can, in principle, be applied across the enzyme family (Scheme 1). We identified a combination of active site point mutations that caused loss of function with UDP-GalNAc but gain of function with synthetic UDP-GalNAc analogs that contain a chemical handle. We found orthogonal enzyme-substrate pairs that retained peptide glycosylation site preferences and catalytic parameters comparable to their native counterparts. The generality of the strategy was demonstrated with bump-hole pairs for the early GalNAc-Ts, -T1 and -T2, and late GalNAc-T, -T10. Scheme 1. A Bump-Hole Approacha aMutagenesis of key gatekeeper residues in the active site of a GalNAc-T introduces a \"hole\" in the engineered GalNAc-T that accommodates an enlarged UDP-GalNAc analog modified with a \"bump\" (orange circle) and chemical handle (orange diamond). The N-acyl side chain of UDP-GalNAc contains a methyl group (red Me) that is modified on the UDP-GalNAc analog to an R-group (red R), representing the bump and chemical handle. Monosaccharides are represented with colored boxes: GalNAc To identify gatekeeper residues we might target for mutagenesis, we analyzed the available crystal structures of the catalytic and lectin domains of GalNAc-T1,35 -T2,36-38 and -T10,39 some of which contained bound GalNAc or UDP-GalNAc in the active site. We considered different positions around GalNAc when selecting a location in the active site for mutagenesis. Notably, we previously found that virtually all GalNAc-T isoenzymes can use UDP-N-azidoacetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAz) as a substrate both in vitro and in living cells or organisms, although with reduced efficiency compared to UDP-GalNAc.40-42 Thus, we anticipated that larger N-acyl substituents would be required to avoid recognition by wild-type GalNAc-T isoenzymes, and these would have to be accommodated by an engineered active site hole. We noted a high degree of conservation of three hydrophobic residues within 5 \u00c5 of the methyl group of GalNAc that create a binding pocket (Figure 1). We hypothesized that some combination of I253, L310, and F361 could serve as active site gatekeeper residues across the enzyme family (Figures 1 and S1). Figure 1. Identification of gatekeeper residues. (A) Residues within 5\u00c5 of GalNAc methyl carbon for GalNAc-T2 (PDB ID: 4D0T). Five of seven amino acids in close proximity to the GalNAc methyl contain side chains; of these, H359 and D224 coordinate Mn2+, and 3 are promising hydrophobic residues. (B) Space-filling model of gatekeeper residues within 5\u00c5 of GalNAc methyl in GalNAc-T2 (PDB ID: 4D0T). (C) Amino acid sequences of human GalNAc-T1-GalNAc-T20 surrounding potential gatekeeper residues demonstrate a high degree of conservation, with 13 isoenzymes containing I253/L310 and 18 containing I253. Only GalNAc-T8 and position 253 and around 310. GalNAc-Ts used in this study are boxed. Clustal Omega was used to generate a multiple sequence alignment of the amino acid sequences corresponding to the full-length genes of human GalNAc-T1-GalNAc-T20 (Figure S2; Table S1). GalNAc-Ts are ordered based on homology, and GalNAc-Ts that predominantly prefer GalNAc-peptides are denoted with an asterisk.10 To test these hypotheses, we initially focused on GalNAc-T2, an early isoenzyme that recognizes unglycosylated peptide substrates and is one of the best characterized of the family.36-38 We generated four single point mutants (I253A, L310A, F361A, and F361S) and one double mutant (I253A/L310A) of a soluble, FLAG epitope-tagged construct secreted from mammalian cells.43 Preliminary screens with purified proteins and the known peptide substrate EA2-biotin (PTTDSTTPAPTTKK(biotin))42 showed minimal activity from either F361 mutant with UDP-GalNAc (1) or UDP-GalNAz (2),42,44 in line with mutagenesis data that were published thereafter.38 The remaining three mutants (I253A, L310A, and I253A/L310A) and wild-type GalNAc-T2 were investigated further. We next designed a quantitative enzymatic assay with the sensitivity and flexibility necessary to accommodate chemically diverse UDP-GalNAc analog libraries and measure kinetic parameters of mutated GalNAc-Ts. Widely-used glycosyltransferase assays rely on the detection of UDP as a side product of the glycosylation reaction.45 Although we used this method for initial screens (Figures S3 and S4), we deemed it of limited utility, as background hydrolysis of UDP-sugars under these conditions produces UDP that limits sensitivity. The assay had to be independent of the nature of the chemical handle, precluding the use of our previously developed azido-ELISA.46 We therefore used the chromophore 2,4-dinitrophenyl-5-L-alanine amide, which was installed on peptide substrates using Marfey's reagent and is convenient to monitor by UV detection on an HPLC. We prepared an artificial, labeled peptide via solid-phase peptide synthesis as an optimal GalNAc-T2 substrate (Peptide-1) based on previously identified amino acid preferences (Figure 2A).21 Figure 2. Synthesis of a peptide substrate and a panel of UDP-GalNAc analogs. (A) Synthetic route for Peptide-1. Blue T indicates the Thr glycosylation site used by GalNAc-T2. (B) Synthetic routes for UDP-GalNAc analogs. Route 1 was used to synthesize UDP-sugars (2, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13). (C) A panel of UDP-GalNAc derivatives with azide or alkyne chemical handles. Compounds 1 and 2 are the natural substrate UDP-GalNAc and known analog UDP-GalNAz, respectively. (pH = 8.0), 0 \u00b0C to r.t. We next synthesized a collection of UDP-GalNAc analogs, chemically diversified at the C2-acylamide moiety and including bioorthogonal azide or alkyne groups. Synthesis of nucleotide sugars is nontrivial, and both chemical and enzymatic routes have been developed.46-50 As UDP-GalNAc biosynthetic enzymes are unlikely to accommodate all envisaged modifications,47,51 we chose to chemically synthesize 20 bumped UDP-GalNAc analogs by two routes adapted from literature procedures (Figure 2B).46,49,52 Installation of the acylamide side chain into a UDP-galactosamine scaffold via active ester chemistry proceeded smoothly to provide compounds 2, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 13 (Figure 2B, Route 2). For UDP-GalNAc analogs containing chiral acylamide -carbon atoms, an alternate route was selected to minimize the risk of acylamide epimerization during installation. Thus, acylamides were introduced at an early stage in the coupling reagent that precluded epimerization. Together, these two routes and an optimized purification procedure enabled us to generate a structurally diverse panel of synthetic UDP-GalNAc analogs (Figure 2C). With purified enzymes, synthetic peptide substrate, and UDP-GalNAc analogs in hand, we assessed the viability of GalNAc-T bump-hole engineering in a combinatorial (Figure efficiently from UDP-GalNAc to the acceptor peptide, and the single mutants T2(I253A) and T2(L310A) still utilized UDP-GalNAc as a donor substrate, although with reduced activity (Figure 3B). In contrast, UDP-GalNAc was a poor substrate for the double mutant enzyme T2(I253A/L310A), which we felt might allow for the development of an orthogonal GalNAc-T and UDP-sugar pair. Figure 3. Screening GalNAc-T2 for an orthogonal enzyme-substrate pair. (A) Scheme for glycosylation reaction with Peptide-1, and UDP-GalNAc or UDP-GalNAc analog form glycosylated Peptide-1.

Peptide-1 were incubated with GalNAc-T2 at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h, and the reaction was quenched by the addition of aqueous EDTA (150 mM, pH = 8.0). The percent conversion to glycopeptide product was quantified by HPLC separation and peak integration.

Glycosylation by wild-type and double mutant GalNAc-T2 was compared for UDP-GalNAc (1) and UDP-GalNAc analogs with Peptide-1. Reactions were performed and quantified as in B. Heat map (blue shading) shows percent glycosylated Peptide-1 formed by wild-type or double mutant GalNAc-T2 with UDP-GalNAc or analogs. Red values represent the mean of technical triplicates. We investigated how enlargement of the GalNAc side chain alters substrate activity for the wild-type and double mutant enzymes (Figures 3C and S5 for selected UDP-GalNAc analogs and Figure S3 for additional analogs). UDP-GalNAz (2) was a better substrate for wild-type GalNAc-T2 than for the double mutant T2(I253A/L310A). Strikingly, however, some UDP-GalNAc analogs with longer or branched N-acyl chains were better substrates for T2(I253A/L310A) than for These the amide as in (S)-3 and (S)-4, longer side chains as in 7, 11 (\"UDP-GalNAlk\"),53 and 13, or both branches and length as in (S)-12, (R)-12, (S)-14, and (R)-14. For analogs 11-14, we observed that as the size of the alkyne-containing bump increased, wild-type enzyme activity plummeted. In contrast, the double mutant enzyme maintained activity with these larger alkyne-functionalized UDP-GalNAc analogs. In the extreme case of (R)-14, glycopeptide formation by the wild-type enzyme was undetectable, while the double mutant still produced glycopeptide product. An orthogonal enzyme-substrate pair should ideally retain the catalytic efficiency of the native enzyme-substrate pair to appropriately emulate biological function. Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis revealed that both native and bump-hole enzyme-substrate pairs had comparable kinetic parameters (Table 1). Catalytic constants (kcat) of enzyme-substrate pairs T2(I253A/L310A) and (S)-3, 7, 11, or (S)-12 differed less than two-fold from the wild-type GalNAc-T2/1 pair. The kcat of the engineered pair T2(I253A/L310A)/13 was approximately five-fold lower. Concomitantly, this pair displayed a ten-fold lower Km compared to the wild-type pair, suggesting that 13 benefitted from increased contacts within the active site leading to stronger substrate binding. Thus, the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of T2(I253A/L310A)/13 is two-fold higher than wild-type GalNAc-T2/1. In contrast, (S)-12 exhibited the weakest interaction with T2(I253A/L310A) among all enzyme-substrate pairs tested, with a ten-fold higher Km than the wild-type pair, suggesting that the methyl branch at the acylamide -position experiences a steric clash with the enzyme. Table 1. Kinetic parameters of wild-type and engineered GalNAc-T2 and UDP-sugar pairs.a aTo determine Km and kcat values for UDP-GalNAc and UDP-GalNAc analogs, initial rates were measured by incubating wild-type or double mutant GalNAc-T2 with concentrations of UDP-sugars varying from 15.6 \u00b5M to 500 \u00b5M and with a constant concentration of acceptor peptide (Peptide-1 = 267 \u00b5M for 250 \u00b5M for 7, (S)-12, 13). The glycosylation was conducted at 37 \u00b0C, and three aliquots were taken within 15 min and quenched by the addition of aqueous EDTA (150 mM, pH = 8.0). Products were quantified by HPLC separation and peak integration. The enzymatic kinetic parameters were obtained by nonlinear regression fitting using GraphPad Prism. All data represent the mean of technical triplicates, and error depicts the standard deviation. To enable potential application in biological systems, wild-type GalNAc-Ts must not accept bumped UDP-GalNAc analogs in the presence of UDP-GalNAc. We examined the relative selectivity of wild-type GalNAc-T2 toward UDP-GalNAc compared to selected analogs (Figure 4). Competition experiments revealed that in the presence of a 1:1 mixture of UDP-GalNAc and either UDP-GalNAc analog (S)-3, 7, 11, or 13, wild-type GalNAc-T2 indeed preferentially transferred GalNAc to Peptide-1. In the reaction that included analog 13, the glycopeptide product observed was almost exclusively that derived relative to UDP-GalNAc analogs. (A) Scheme competition experiment between UDP-GalNAc and UDP-GalNAc analog. Wild-type GalNAc-T2 was treated with Peptide-1 and an equal ratio of UDP-GalNAc and UDP-GalNAc analog in a competition experiment, and glycosylation reactions were terminated at 20-30% glycopeptide formation. (B) Selectivity wild-type GalNAc-T2 for UDP-GalNAc (1) over UDP-GalNAc analog ((S)-3, 7, 11, or 13) in a competition experiment. Reactions were performed as in A. UDP-sugars and Peptide-1 were incubated with GalNAc-T2 at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min, and the reaction was quenched by the addition of aqueous EDTA (150 mM, pH = 8.0). The percent conversion to glycopeptide product was quantified by HPLC separation and peak integration. Percent of Peptide-1 modified with GalNAc or GalNAc analog was measured, and the selectivity ratio is shown in blue. All data represent the mean of technical triplicates, and the error bars represent the standard deviation. We next sought to determine if our bump-hole strategy could be generalized to study other members of the GalNAc-T family. We thus extended the approach to GalNAc-T1, an early isoenzyme that is phylogenetically distant from GalNAc-T2, and GalNAc-T10, a late isoenzyme that prefers glycosylated substrates and, as such, is particularly difficult to study in vivo.10,15 We generated wild-type and double mutant versions of GalNAc-T1 and -T10 using the same methods and gatekeeper residues homologous to GalNAc-T2 (I238A/L295A for -T1, I266A/L321A for -T10). acceptor substrates labeled with 2,4-dinitrophenyl-5-L-alanine amide in the same fashion as Peptide-1. Similar to GalNAc-T2, amino acid preferences : and we used an optimized sequence for Peptide-2, which contains a single threonine for glycosylation (Figure 5A).21 GalNAc-T10, as a late isoenzyme, a pre-installed GalNAc directly adjacent C-terminally to the glycosylation site. To this end, MUC5AC-3, a known GalNAc-T10 glycopeptide substrate, was used as the sequence for Peptide-3 (Figure 5A).12,54 Gratifyingly, the bump-hole approach developed for GalNAc-T2 was directly transferrable to both early and late GalNAc-T isoenzymes. Wild-type GalNAc-T1 efficiently catalyzed glycosylation with UDP-GalNAc, whereas minimal activity was observed with UDP-GalNAc analog 13 (Figure 5B). In contrast, T1(I238A/L295A) did not utilize UDP-GalNAc as a substrate but efficiently transferred the modified GalNAc residue from analog 13 to Peptide-2 (Figures 5B and S4). Similar to GalNAc-T2 engineering, the kcat of T1(I238A/L295A) with 13 was approximately five-fold lower than the kcat of wild-type GalNAc-T1 with UDP-GalNAc (Figure 5C). In contrast, the Km value was unaltered, resulting in a reduction of catalytic efficiency by less than an order of magnitude (Figure 5C). The selectivity of the late isoenzyme GalNAc-T10 showed identical trends; the preference of wild-type GalNAc-T10 for UDP-GalNAc over 13 was reversed in the double mutant T10(I266A/L321A), highlighting the universality of our bump-hole approach for multiple members of the GalNAc-T family with diverse peptide substrate preferences (Figure 5B). Mutation of I266 and L321 to alanine residues had no effect on the kcat and conferred only a two-fold higher Km with the UDP-sugar analog, despite a switch in specificity from UDP-GalNAc to 13 (Figure 5C). Figure 5.

Blue T indicates the Thr glycosylation site used by the GalNAc-T of interest. (B) Glycopeptide formation by wild-type or double mutant GalNAc-T1 or GalNAc-T10 with UDP-GalNAc (1) or 13. Reactions were performed as in A. GalNAc-T, UDP-sugar, and peptide were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h (-T10) or 2 h (-T1), and the reaction was quenched with aqueous EDTA (150 mM, pH = 8.0). All data represent the mean of technical triplicates, and the error bars represent the standard deviation. (C) Kinetic parameters of wild-type and orthogonal GalNAc-T and UDP-sugar pairs. To determine Km and kcat values for UDP-GalNAc and UDP-GalNAc analogs, initial rates were measured by incubating wild-type or double mutant GalNAc-Ts with varying concentrations of UDP-sugars and a constant concentration of acceptor peptide. For GalNAc-T1, the concentration of UDP-sugars varied from 15.6 \u00b5M to 500 \u00b5M, and the concentration of acceptor Peptide-2 was held at 250 \u00b5M. For GalNAc-T10, the concentration of UDP-sugars varied from 15.6 \u00b5M to 250 \u00b5M, and the concentration of acceptor Peptide-3 was held at 266 \u00b5M. The glycosylation was conducted at 37 \u00b0C, and three aliquots were taken within 15 min and quenched by the addition of aqueous EDTA (150 mM, pH = 8.0). Products were quantified by HPLC separation and peak integration. The enzymatic kinetic parameters were obtained by nonlinear regression fitting using GraphPad Prism. All data represent the mean of technical triplicates, and error depicts the standard deviation. Finally, we explored whether the glycosylation site specificity of all three GalNAc-T bump-hole pairs was altered due to the active site mutations we introduced (Figure 6). In contrast to protein substrates, Peptide-2:peptideTGAGAFFPTPGPAGAGKCOOH(DAA)HNGalNAc-T1(Peptide-2)orGalNAc-T10(Peptide-3)Peptide-3:GTT*PSPVPTTSTTSAP(DAA)HNCOOHT* have been exhaustively mapped and are the basis for recent mechanistic and structural studies.15,20,21,42,55 We performed glycosylation reactions with known peptide and/or glycopeptide substrates of GalNAc-T1, -T2 and -T10, the resulting mono-(GalNAc-T1 and -T2) or di-glycopeptides (GalNAc-T10) by tandem mass spectrometry to identify site preferences. The glycopeptide MUC5AC-3 contains multiple potential glycosylation sites, three of which are glycosylated at different frequencies by wild-type GalNAc-T2 and UDP-GalNAc.56 We observed similar fine specificities for these sites with the T2(I253A/L310A)/13 pair, with a preference for Thr13 over Thr9 and Thr10 (Figure 6B). A similar retention of site specificity was found using other known GalNAc-T2 substrates, the glycopeptide MUC5AC-13 and the peptide EA2 was also retained and -T10 bump-hole pairs, using EA2 and MUC5AC-3 (Figure 6B).54,57 Of note, GalNAc-T10 contains a GalNAc binding pocket in the glycosyltransferase domain directly adjacent to the active site, conferring selectivity toward pre-glycosylated substrates.58 The double mutant T10(I266A/L321A) maintains specificity for Thr2 of MUC5AC-3, the only Thr adjacent to an existing glycosite, and exhibits minimally altered kinetic parameters. These data indicate that bump-hole engineering retains the nature of T10(I266A/L321A) as a late isoenzyme. Figure 6. Glycosylation of natural peptide substrates by wild-type and engineered GalNAc-T isoenzyme-substrate pairs.

Glycosylation reactions were terminated at 10-20% glycopeptide formation. (B) Percent of glycosylated peptide formed out of total glycosylated peptide formed. Reactions were performed as in A at 37 \u00b0C and quenched by the addition of aqueous EDTA (150 mM, pH = 8.0).

Fragmentation pattern of EA2 amino acid sequence to generate c-ions (blue) and z-ions (red) is shown. Conclusions Taken together, these data show that GalNAc-T bump-hole pairs retain the glycosylation site fine specificities and general kinetic parameters of the native enzyme-substrate pairs. Such an outcome is promising for application of this technology to the discovery of new protein substrates and glycosylation sites in living systems. It is particularly notable that this strategy translates successfully to GalNAc-T10, which, as a late isoenzyme, is notoriously difficult to orthogonal bump-hole system for a glycosyltransferase family, an achievement that would not have been possible without structural data, particularly the first structure of GalNAc-T10 bound to GalNAc and UDP reported in 2006.39 Currently, five total GalNAc-T family members have been structurally characterized with the addition of several recent crystals,15 establishing a foundation for the identification of promising gatekeeper residues to target for mutagenesis. Further forays into structural characterization of other glycosyltransferase families are warranted to expand this approach across the larger enzyme superfamily. It should be noted that, while structure data formed a cornerstone to this study, the ability to synthesize and rapidly screen many substrate analogs proved critical to identifying orthogonal bump-hole pairs. By exploring chemical space around the N-acyl position, we identified substrates with exquisite specificity for double mutant GalNAc-Ts. We envision that bump-hole pairs such as those described here could be generally applicable across the GalNAc-T family, given their well-conserved UDP-GalNAc binding site.10,15 The bump-hole enzyme-substrate pairs we developed here set the stage for a new approach to the identification of biological substrates of GalNAc-Ts in living systems, analogous to work done with other enzyme families.31,59,60 Methods Expression of GalNAc-Ts. The soluble domains of GalNAc-T2, -T1, and -T10 include both the catalytic and lectin domains, and the design of our mammalian secretion constructs were based on published constructs.43 These truncated constructs were cloned into pFLAG-myc-CMV19, containing an N-terminal preprotrypsin leader sequence and an N-terminal FLAG tag. Mutations in GalNAc-T2 and -T1 were introduced using site-directed mutagenesis and mutations in -T10 were introduced during gene synthesis (Table S2). Truncated GalNAc-Ts were expressed in HEK-293T cells and purified from the culture medium by FLAG affinity chromatography. Glycerol was added to purified proteins to a final concentration of 25% (v/v). Proteins were quantified by densitometry of Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel bands, aliquoted and stored at 80 \u00b0C. Western blot confirmed the identity of FLAG-tagged GalNAc-Ts (Figure S6). Representative experimental procedure for the preparation of UDP-N-acetyl--D-galactosamine derivatives (Figure 2B).
