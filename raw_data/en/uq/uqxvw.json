However, full approval by the FDA was a precondition to add COVID -19 vaccine to other vaccinations required for in- person school attendance. 19 CDPH Statement on Timeline for COVID -19 Vaccine Requirements in Schools COVID -19 Immunization Mandate for Schools To ensure sufficient time for successful implementation, California will not initiate the regulatory process for a COVID -19 vaccine requirement for the 2022- 2023 school year. Any vaccine requirements would not take effect until after full FDA approval and no sooner than July 1, 2023. Please continue your efforts to help students catch up and stay up to date with COVID -19 vaccines and other routine immunizations. 20 CDPH Statement on Timeline for COVID -19 Vaccine Requirements in Schools21Stay Current on the Latest School Requirement Information CDPH Statement on Timeline for COVID -19 Vaccine Requirements in SchoolsVaccine Administration Data Elizabeth Reosti , CDPH 22Vaccine Administration Summary as of May 31, 2022 2376,314,328 Total Doses Administered: Public Dashboard Link Trends in Vaccine Administration as of May 27, 2022 24 Trends in Vaccine Administration as of May 27, 2022 25Second boosters among 50+ year -olds First boosters among 5- to-11-year-oldsNew Booster Eligibility Driving Demand FDA News Release: Expanding Booster Eligibility for 5- to-11-Year-Olds5-to-11-year -old Vaccination Trends as of May 27, 2022 26Modest increase in first doses among 5- to-11- year-olds1stBooster Vaccination Rates as of May 27, 2022 27 State Avg 50%Sate Avg 70%Latest Metrics 76.3 Million in previous week (+0% ptchange) 5,581 new 5 -to-11-year-old recipients (+2% ptchange) System Updates 5-to-11-year-olds now eligible for booster 4thdoses included in overall dose admin count, but not currently displayed in immunization statusData Summary Data Summary as of May 27, 2022 28Storage & Handling Alan Hendrickson, CDPH 29Job Aid: Missed Vaccination Opportunities & Wastage 30 Job Aid: Missed Vaccination Opportunities & WastageJob Aid Includes: Key Points CDC Guidance Tips to Reduce Wastage Links to Resources & ToolkitsJob Aid: Reporting Doses Spoiled, Expired or Wasted 31 Job Aid: Reporting Doses Spoiled, Expired, or WastedJob Aid Includes: Program Requirement Reporting Requirements Spoiled Vaccines Wastage Table Medical Waste ManagementPediatric Vaccines Pfizer Pediatric (6 months -4 years) Maroon Cap: 12 months at ULT ( -90\u00b0to-60\u00b0C) Do not store at frozen temperatures 10 weeks at refrigerated temperatures (2\u00b0 -8\u00b0C) 12 hours prior to puncture at normal room temperature (8\u00b0 -25\u00b0C) 12 hours after puncture at normal room temperature (8\u00b0 -25\u00b0C) Requires diluent TPR will redistribute And now, the label... 32Pediatric Vaccines Pfizer Pediatric (6 months -4years) Maroon Cap, the label: 33 Pediatric Vaccines Moderna Pediatric (6 months -5 years) & (6 years -11 years): 9 months at frozen temperatures ( -50\u00b0to -15\u00b0C) 30 days at refrigerated temperatures (2\u00b0 -8\u00b0C) 12 hours after puncture at normal room temperature (2\u00b0 -25\u00b0C) Nodiluent required 10 dose vials, 100 dose minimum order Read the vaccine fact sheet TPR redistribution, in negotiations 34Provider Office Hours Q&A 35 During today's session, please use the Q&A panel to ask your questions so our subject matter experts can respond directly .Vaccine Management Eric Norton, My Turn, and Maria Volk, CDPH 36My Turn Release 26.5 Update 37Clinic Managers (CM) and Vaccine Administrators (VA) can create a new clinic that offers the Pfizer 5- to-11 Booster vaccine, manage the vaccine supply, and book appointments.

Suggested interval to start revaccination is 6 months after completion of B -cell-depleting therapy. A patient's clinical team is best positioned to determine the degree of immune compromise, need for revaccination, appropriate timing of revaccination, and potential use of EVUSHELD . 55Use of COVID- 19 Vaccines in the United States: Interim Clinical Considerations (CDC) Considerations for Timing of COVID -19 Vaccination in Relation to Immunosuppressive TherapyClinical Guidance Update: Vaccination of People with a History of MIS -A or MIS-C Children with a history of MIS -C: benefits outweigh theoretical risks if they meet the following criteria: Clinical recovery achieved At least 90 days after diagnosis of MIS -C Patient resides in area where COVID -19 community level is high Adults with MIS -A: Risk/benefit discussion with clinical team. Consider CISA consultation. People with a history of post -vaccination MIS -A or MIS -C MIS onset <90 days after most recent COVID -19 vaccine doses Children with MIS -C: Defer subsequent COVID -19 dose(s). Provider may offer subsequent dose(s) if certain criteria are met (see guidance) Adults with MIS -A: Risk/benefit discussion with clinical team. Consider CISA consultation. MIS onset >90 days after most recent COVID -19 vaccine dose Children with MIS -C: Consider subsequent doses if: Clinical recovery achieved At least 90 days after diagnosis of MIS -C Patient resides in area where COVID -19 community level is high Adults with MIS -A: Risk/benefit discussion with clinical team. Consider CISA consultation . 56 Considerations for initiating COVID -19 vaccination in people with a history of MIS -C or MIS -AClinical Guidance Update: People with Prior or Current SARS-CoV -2 Infection Vaccination following SARS -CoV-2 infection further increases protection from subsequent infection andhospitalization , including in the setting of increased circulation of more infectious SARS -CoV-2 strains. People who recently had SARS -CoV-2 infection may consider delaying a primary series dose or their first or second COVID -19 vaccine booster dose by 3 months from symptom onset or positive test (if the infection was asymptomatic). Increased time between infection and vaccination may result in an improved immune response to vaccination. Low risk of reinfection has been observed in the weeks to months following infection. Consider risk of COVID -19 severe disease, COVID -19 community level, or characteristics of predominant SARS- CoV-2 strain when determining whether or not to delay COVID -19 vaccination after infection. 57 CDC COVID- 19 Vaccine Clinical Guidance: People with prior or current SARS -CoV-2 InfectionFDA VACCINES AND RELATED BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS ADVISORY COMMITTEE (VRBPAC) MEETINGS: JUNE 2022 FDA VRBPAC Meetings Announcement 4/29/22; Updated 5/23/22 | FDA YouTube Meeting Webcast 58Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday 6 7 Novavax EUA Request for 18+8 9 10 13 for 23 24 28Strain composition of COVID- 19 VaccinesBooster Resources on EZIZ COVID 59 Boost Your Health Flyer IMM: 1416 Healthcare Workers Boost Your Health IMM:1428Wrap -up Leslie Amani, CDPH 60Additional Support Type of Support Description COVID -19 Provider Call CenterThe COVID -19 Call Center for Providers and Local Health Departments is dedicated to medical providers in California and their COVID -19 response, specifically addressing questions about State program requirements, enrollment, and vaccine distribution, including the Vaccine Marketplace.
