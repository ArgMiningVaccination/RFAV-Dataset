Skin cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the skin. The skin is the body's largest [organ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). It protects against heat, sunlight, injury, and [infection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45364&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Skin also helps control body temperature and stores water, fat, and [vitamin D](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=427253&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The skin has several layers, but the two main layers are the [epidermis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46418&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (upper or outer layer) and the [dermis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46454&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (lower or inner layer). [Skin cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445084&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) begins in the epidermis, which is made up of three kinds of [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): [Squamous cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46056&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Thin, flat cells that form the top layer of the epidermis. [Basal cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46516&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Round cells under the squamous cells. [Melanocytes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46292&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Cells that make [melanin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46291&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and are found in the lower part of the epidermis. Melanin is the [pigment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46225&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)that gives skin its natural color. When skin is exposed to the sun, melanocytes make more pigment and cause the skin to darken. Skin cancer can occur anywhere on the body, but it is most common in skin that is often exposed to sunlight, such as the face, neck, and hands. Different types of cancer start in the skin. Skin cancer may form in basal cells or squamous cells. [Basal cell carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46515&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [squamous cell carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=787988&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are the most common types of skin cancer. They are also called [nonmelanoma skin cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46261&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Actinic keratosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45133&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a skin [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that sometimes becomes squamous cell carcinoma. [Melanoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45135&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is less common than basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. It is more likely to invade nearby [tissues](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and spread to other parts of the body. This summary is about basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, and actinic keratosis. Having a fair complexion and being exposed to sunlight are risk factors for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Anything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease is called a [risk factor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Not every person with one or more of these risk factors will develop skin cancer, and it will develop in people who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin include the following: - Being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (such as from tanning beds) over long periods of time. - Having a fair complexion, which includes the following: - Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly. - Blue, green, or other light-colored eyes. - Red or blond hair. Although having a fair complexion is a risk factor for skin cancer, people of all skin colors can get skin cancer. - Having a [history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642021&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)of sunburns. - Having a personal or [family history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=302456&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)of basal cell carcinoma, squamous [familial dysplastic nevus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46412&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [syndrome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45090&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or the [genes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or [hereditary](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45983&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)syndromes, such as [basal cell nevus syndrome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=256555&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), that are linked to skin cancer. - Having skin [inflammation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44042&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)that has lasted for long periods of time. - Having a weakened [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). - Being exposed to [arsenic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44303&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). - Past treatment with [radiation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Older age is the main risk factor for most cancers. The chance of getting cancer increases as you get older. Basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, and actinic keratosis often appear as a change in the skin. Not all changes in the skin are a [sign](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or actinic keratosis. Check with your doctor if you notice any changes in your skin. Signs of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin include the following: - A sore that does not heal. - Areas of the skin that are: - Raised, smooth, shiny, and look pearly. - Firm and look like a scar, and may be white, yellow, or waxy. - Raised and red or reddish-brown. - Scaly, bleeding, or crusty. Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin occur most often in areas of the skin exposed to the sun, such as the nose, ears, lower lip, or top of the hands. Signs of actinic keratosis include the following: - A rough, red, pink, or brown, scaly patch on the skin that may be flat or raised. - Cracking or peeling of the lower lip that is not helped by lip balm or [petroleum jelly](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=572215&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Actinic keratosis occurs most commonly on the face or the top of the hands. Tests or procedures that examine the skin are used to diagnose basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. In addition to asking about your [personal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642019&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [family health history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642015&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and doing a [physical exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270871&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures: - Skin exam: An exam of the skin for bumps or spots that look [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)in color, size, shape, or texture. - Skin [biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45164&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): All or part of the abnormal-looking growth is cut from the skin and viewed under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)by a [pathologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46244&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)to check for signs of cancer. There are four main types of skin biopsies: [Shave biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46578&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A [sterile](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46600&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)razor blade is used to \"shave-off\" the abnormal-looking growth. [Punch biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=410643&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A special instrument called a punch or a [trephine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=423245&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is used to remove a circle of tissue from the abnormal-looking growth. [Incisional biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46698&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A [scalpel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257527&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is used to remove part of a growth. [Excisional biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46411&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A scalpel is used to remove the entire growth. Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The [prognosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45849&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for squamous cell carcinoma of the skin depends mostly on the following: [Stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)of the cancer. - Whether the patient is [immunosuppressed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=792406&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). - Whether the patient uses [tobacco](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439432&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). - The patient's general health. Treatment options for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin depend on the following: - The type of cancer. - The stage of the cancer, for squamous cell carcinoma. - The size of the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and what part of the body it affects. - The patient's general health. Stages of Skin Cancer Key Points - After squamous cell cancer of the skin has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the skin or to other parts of the body. - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. - Staging for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin depends on where the cancer formed. - The following stages are used for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that is on the head or neck but not on the eyelid: - Stage 0 (Carcinoma in situ) - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV - The following stages are used for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin on the eyelid: - Stage 0 (Carcinoma in situ) - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV - Treatment depends on the type of skin cancer or other skin condition diagnosed: - Basal cell carcinoma - Squamous cell carcinoma - Actinic keratosis After squamous cell cancer of the skin has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the skin or to other parts of the body. The process used to find out if [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has spread within the skin or to other parts of the body is called [staging](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46597&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The information gathered from the staging process determines the [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment for [squamous cell carcinoma of the skin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=787988&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Basal cell carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46515&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the skin rarely spreads to other parts of the body. Staging tests to check whether basal cell carcinoma of the skin has spread are usually not needed. The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process for squamous cell carcinoma of the skin: [CT scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the head, neck, and chest, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an [x-ray](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)machine. A [dye](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=409764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)may be [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or swallowed to help the [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or [tissues](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)show up more clearly. This procedure is also called tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. [Chest x-ray](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. [PET scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46140&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find [malignant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45772&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)in the body. A small amount of [radioactive glucose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=774386&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET [scanner](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386220&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)rotates around the body and makes a picture of where [glucose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. Sometimes a PET scan and CT scan are done at the same time. [Ultrasound](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46157&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues, such as [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a [sonogram](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46587&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The picture can be printed to be looked at later. An ultrasound exam of the [regional lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)may be done for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. - Eye exam with [dilated](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257207&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [pupil](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=546600&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): An exam of the eye in which the pupil is dilated (opened wider) with medicated eye drops to allow the doctor to look through the [lens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=572035&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and pupil to the [retina](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=440115&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and [optic nerve](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46248&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The inside of the eye, including the retina and the optic nerve, is examined with a light. [Lymph node biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=793499&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): The removal of all or part of a lymph node. A [pathologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46244&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)views the lymph node tissue under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)to check for cancer cells. A lymph node biopsy may be done for squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer can spread through [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the [lymph system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and the [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the [lymph vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269462&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)to other parts of the body. - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the [blood vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)to other parts of the body. Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called [metastasis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46710&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) break away from where they began (the [primary tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45847&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) and travel through the lymph system or blood. - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)( [metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)tumor) in another part of the body. - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. The [metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if [skin cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445084&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) spreads to the [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the cancer cells in the lung are actually skin cancer cells. The disease is metastatic skin cancer, not [lung cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445043&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Staging for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin depends on where the cancer formed. Staging for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the eyelid is different from staging for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma found on other areas of the head or neck. There is no staging system for basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma that is not found on the head or neck. Surgery to remove the primary tumor and [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) lymph nodes is done so that tissue samples can be studied under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This is called [pathologic staging](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and the findings are used for staging as described below. If staging is done before [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to remove the tumor, it is called [clinical staging](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=683420&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The clinical stage may be different from the pathologic stage. The following stages are used for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that is on the head or neck but not on the eyelid: Stage 0 (Carcinoma in situ) In [stage 0](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=368445&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are found in [basal cell](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46516&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) layer of the [epidermis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46418&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). These abnormal cells may become [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and spread into nearby normal [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ. Stage I In [stage I](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=368446&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has formed and the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is 2 [centimeters](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354457&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or smaller. Stage II In [stage II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=368447&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is larger than 2 [centimeters](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354457&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) but not larger than 4 centimeters. Stage III or In [stage III](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=368448&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), one of the following is found: - the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is larger than 4 [centimeters](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354457&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)has spread to [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)covering the [nerves](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373935&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)below the [dermis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46454&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or has spread below the [subcutaneous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45914&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)tissue, or has spread to the bone and the bone has minor damage. Cancer may have also spread to one [lymph node](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)on the same side of the body as the tumor and the node is 3 centimeters or smaller, and cancer has not spread through to the outside covering of the lymph node; or - the tumor is 4 centimeters or smaller. Cancer has spread to one lymph node on the same side of the body as the tumor and the node is 3 centimeters or smaller. Stage IV or or In [stage IV](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=368449&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), one of the following is found: - the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is any size and [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)may have spread to the bone and the bone has minor damage, or to [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)covering the [nerves](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373935&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)below the [dermis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46454&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or below the [subcutaneous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45914&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)tissue. Cancer has spread to the [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)as follows: - one lymph node on the same side of the body as the tumor, the affected node is 3 [centimeters](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354457&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or smaller, and cancer has spread through to the outside covering of the lymph node; or - one lymph node on the same side of the body as the tumor, the affected node is larger than 3 centimeters but not larger than 6 centimeters, and cancer has not spread through to the outside covering of the lymph node; or - more than one lymph node on the same side of the body as the tumor, the affected nodes are 6 centimeters or smaller, and cancer has not spread through to the outside covering of the lymph nodes; or - one or more lymph nodes on the opposite side of the body as the tumor or on both sides of the body, the affected nodes are 6 centimeters or smaller, and cancer has not spread through to the outside covering of the lymph nodes. - one lymph node on the same side of the body as the tumor, the affected node is 3 - the tumor is any size and cancer may have spread to tissue covering the nerves below the dermis, or below the subcutaneous tissue, or to [bone marrow](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45622&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or to bone, including the bottom of the [skull](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=763008&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Also: - cancer has spread to one lymph node that is larger than 6 centimeters and cancer has not spread through to the outside covering of the lymph node; or - cancer has spread to one lymph node on the same side of the body as the tumor, the affected node is larger than 3 centimeters, and cancer has spread through to the outside covering of the lymph node; or - cancer has spread to one lymph node on the opposite side of the body as the tumor, the affected node is any size, and cancer has spread through to the outside covering of the lymph node; or - cancer has spread to more than one lymph node on one or both sides of the body and cancer has spread through to the outside covering of the lymph nodes. - the tumor is any size and cancer has spread to bone marrow or to bone, including the bottom of the skull, and the bone has been damaged. Cancer may have also spread to the lymph nodes; or - cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The following stages are used for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin on the eyelid: Stage 0 (Carcinoma in situ) In [stage 0](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=736216&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are found in the [epidermis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46418&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), usually in the [basal cell](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46516&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) layer. These abnormal cells may become [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and spread into nearby normal [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ. Stage I In [stage I](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=736219&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has formed. Stage I is divided into stages IA and IB. - Stage IA: The [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is 10 [millimeters](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44215&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or smaller and may have spread to the edge of the eyelid where the lashes are, to the [connective tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44013&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)in the eyelid, or to the full thickness of the eyelid. - Stage IB: The tumor is larger than 10 millimeters but not larger than 20 millimeters and the tumor has not spread to the edge of the eyelid where the lashes are, or to the connective tissue in the eyelid. Stage II [Stage II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=736221&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is divided into stages IIA and IIB. - In stage IIA, one of the following is found: - the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is larger than 10 [millimeters](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44215&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)but not larger than 20 millimeters and has spread to the edge of the eyelid where the lashes are, to the [connective tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44013&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)in the eyelid, or to the full thickness of the eyelid; or - the tumor is larger than 20 millimeters but not larger than 30 millimeters and may have spread to the edge of the eyelid where the lashes are, to the connective tissue in the eyelid, or to the full thickness of the eyelid. - the - In stage IIB, the tumor may be any size and has spread to the eye, eye socket, [sinuses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=641960&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), tear ducts, or brain, or to the [tissues](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)that support the eye. Stage III [Stage III](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=736223&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is divided into stages IIIA and IIIB. - Stage IIIA: The [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)may be any size and may have spread to the edge of the eyelid where the lashes are, to the [connective tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44013&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)in the eyelid, or to the full thickness of the eyelid, or to the eye, eye socket, [sinuses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=641960&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), tear ducts, or brain, or to the [tissues](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)that support the eye. [Cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)has spread to one [lymph node](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)on the same side of the body as the tumor and the node is 3 [centimeters](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354457&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or smaller. - Stage IIIB: The tumor may be any size and may have spread to the edge of the eyelid where the lashes are, to the connective tissue in the eyelid, or to the full thickness of the eyelid, or to the eye, eye socket, sinuses, tear ducts, or brain, or to the tissues that support the eye. Cancer has spread to lymph nodes as follows: - one lymph node on the same side of the body as the tumor and the node is larger than 3 centimeters; or - more than one lymph node on the opposite side of the body as the tumor or on both sides of the body. Stage IV In [stage IV](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=736225&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has spread to other parts of the body, such as the [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Treatment depends on the type of skin cancer or other skin condition diagnosed: Basal cell carcinoma [Basal cell carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46515&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is the most common type of [skin cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445084&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). It usually occurs on areas of the skin that have been in the sun, most often the nose. Often this [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) appears as a raised bump that looks smooth and pearly. A less common type looks like a scar or it is flat and firm and may be skin-colored, yellow, or waxy. Basal cell carcinoma may spread to [tissues](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) around the cancer, but it usually does not spread to other parts of the body. Squamous cell carcinoma [Squamous cell carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=787988&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) occurs on areas of the skin that have been damaged by the sun, such as the ears, lower lip, and the back of the hands. Squamous cell carcinoma may also appear on areas of the skin that have been sunburned or exposed to [chemicals](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=643008&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [radiation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45072&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Often this [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) looks like a firm red bump. The [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may feel scaly, bleed, or form a crust. Squamous cell tumors may spread to nearby [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Squamous cell carcinoma that has not spread can usually be [cured](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=318813&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Actinic keratosis [Actinic keratosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45133&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a skin [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that not [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), but sometimes changes into [squamous cell carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=787988&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). One or more [lesions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46324&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may occur in areas that have been exposed to the sun, such as the face, the back of the hands, and the lower lip. It looks like rough, red, pink, or brown scaly patches on the skin that may be flat or raised, or as a cracked and peeling lower lip that is not helped by lip balm or [petroleum jelly](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=572215&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Actinic keratosis may disappear without treatment. Treatment Option Overview Key Points - There are different types of treatment for patients with basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, and actinic keratosis. - The following types of treatment are used: - Surgery - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - Photodynamic therapy - Immunotherapy - Targeted therapy - Chemical peel - Other drug therapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Treatment for skin cancer may cause side effects. - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed. There are different types of treatment for patients with basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, and actinic keratosis. Different types of treatment are available for patients with [basal cell carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46515&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [squamous cell carcinoma of the skin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=787988&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [actinic keratosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45133&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Some treatments are [standard](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A treatment clinical trial is a [research study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651211&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. The following types of treatment are used: Surgery One or more of the following [surgical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) procedures may be used to treat basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or actinic keratosis: - Simple [excision](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269459&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): The [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), along with some of the normal [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)around it, is cut from the skin. [Mohs micrographic surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=256570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): The tumor is cut from the skin in thin layers. During the procedure, the edges of the tumor and each layer of tumor removed are viewed through a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)to check for cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Layers continue to be removed until no more cancer cells are seen. This type of surgery removes as little normal tissue as possible. It is often used to remove [skin cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445084&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)on the face, fingers, or [genitals](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476624&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and skin cancer that does not have a clear border. - Shave excision: The [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)area is shaved off the surface of the skin with a small blade. [Curettage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46459&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and [electrodesiccation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46434&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): The tumor is cut from the skin with a [curette](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46460&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(a sharp, spoon-shaped tool). A needle-shaped [electrode](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454755&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is then used to treat the area with an electric current that stops the bleeding and destroys cancer cells that remain around the edge of the [wound](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=441269&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The process may be repeated one to three times during the surgery to remove all of the cancer. This type of treatment is also called electrosurgery. [Cryosurgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45407&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue, such as [carcinoma in situ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46488&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This type of treatment is also called cryotherapy. [Laser surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322858&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A surgical procedure that uses a [laser](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45748&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)beam (a narrow beam of intense light) as a knife to make bloodless cuts in tissue or to remove a surface [lesion](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46324&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)such as a tumor. [Dermabrasion](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642132&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Removal of the top layer of skin using a rotating wheel or small particles to rub away skin cells. Simple excision, Mohs micrographic surgery, curettage and electrodesiccation, and cryosurgery are used to treat basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Laser surgery is rarely used to treat basal cell carcinoma. Simple excision, shave excision, curettage and desiccation, dermabrasion, and laser surgery are used to treat actinic keratosis. Radiation therapy [Radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy [x-rays](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or other types of [radiation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45072&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. [External radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46686&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. External radiation therapy is used to treat basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Chemotherapy [Chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a cancer treatment that uses [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Chemotherapy for basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, and actinic keratosis is usually [topical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46619&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (applied to the skin in a cream or lotion). Topical [fluorouracil](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46090&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (5-FU) is used to treat basal cell carcinoma. See [Drugs Approved for Basal Cell Carcinoma](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/skin) for more information. Photodynamic therapy [Photodynamic therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45238&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (PDT) is a cancer treatment that uses a drug and a certain type of light to kill cancer cells. A drug that is not active until it is exposed to light is injected into a vein or put on the skin. The drug collects more in cancer cells than in normal cells. For skin cancer, laser light is shined onto the skin and the drug becomes active and kills the cancer cells. Photodynamic therapy causes little damage to healthy tissue. Photodynamic therapy is also used to treat actinic keratoses. Immunotherapy [Immunotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45729&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a treatment that uses the patient's [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer. There are different types of immunotherapy used to treat skin cancer: - [Immune checkpoint inhibitors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=772606&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)block proteins called checkpoints that are made by some types of immune system cells, such as T cells, and some cancer cells. [PD-1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=777027&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is a [protein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)on the surface of [T cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44928&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)that helps keep the body's [immune responses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45722&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)in check. [PD-L1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=797389&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is a protein found on some types of cancer cells. When PD-1 attaches to PD-L1, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors keep PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins from attaching to each other. This allows the T cells to kill cancer cells. [Cemiplimab](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=795107&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and [pembrolizumab](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=764538&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)are types of PD-1 inhibitors used to treat squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that is locally advanced or has spread to other parts of the body. - [Interferon](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45324&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(by [injection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) may be used to treat squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. [Topical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45927&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [imiquimod](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45080&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)therapy is an [immune response](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45722&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)modifier that may be used to treat some basal cell carcinomas and is applied to the skin as a cream. See [Drugs Approved for Basal Cell Carcinoma](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/skin) for more information. Targeted therapy [Targeted therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270742&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. [Signal transduction inhibitor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44829&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)therapy: This treatment block signals that are passed from one [molecule](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45065&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)to another inside a cell. Blocking these signals may kill cancer cells. [Vismodegib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=725034&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and [sonidegib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=774545&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)are signal transduction inhibitors used to treat basal cell carcinoma. See [Drugs Approved for Basal Cell Carcinoma](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/skin) for more information. Chemical peel A [chemical peel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642125&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a procedure used to improve the way certain skin conditions look. A [chemical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=643008&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) solution is put on the skin to dissolve the top layers of skin cells. Chemical peels may be used to treat actinic keratosis. This type of treatment is also called chemabrasion and chemexfoliation. Other drug therapy [Retinoids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45870&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (drugs related to [vitamin A](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45248&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) are sometimes used to treat squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. [Diclofenac](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=617662&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [ingenol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=794372&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are topical drugs used to treat actinic keratosis. New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. Information about clinical trials is available from the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials). Treatment for skin cancer may cause side effects. For information about [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) caused by treatment for cancer, see our [Side Effects](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects) page. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients, taking part in a [clinical trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the [standard treatment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from [recurring](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (coming back) or reduce the [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI's [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/search) webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) website. Follow-up tests may be needed. Some of the tests that were done to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) the cancer or to find out the [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has changed or if the cancer has [recurred](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (come back). These tests are sometimes called [follow-up](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44671&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tests or check-ups. If basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma [recur](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (come back), it is usually within 5 years of initial treatment.

To Learn More About Skin Cancer For more information from the [National Cancer Institute](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44266&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) about skin cancer, see the following: Squamous of the Skin Treatment](/types/skin/patient/child-skin-treatment-pdq) [Cryosurgery to Treat Cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/surgery/cryosurgery) [Lasers [Immunotherapy to Treat Cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy) For general [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) information and other resources from the National Cancer Institute, see the following: About This PDQ Summary About PDQ Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq). PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government's center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. Purpose of This Summary This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of skin cancer. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Reviewers and Updates Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment). Clinical Trial Information A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center) (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
