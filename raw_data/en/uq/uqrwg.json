Alison A. Nelson, Owner and Licensed Acupuncturist Welcome to Point of Healing Acupuncture in Milford, Massachusetts. Your health is precious. A lot of us take our health for granted until one day it happened. It could be an accident, something we just woke up with, aging, or finally realized I want to feel healthy again. For me, it was an accident 21 years ago that changed my life. I was jogging and was hit by a pickup truck. For over six months I tried numerous therapies but nothing seemed to help. My rehabilitation doctor wanted to start doing spinal epidural injections to numb my neck and back pain but I said no because of the potential risks and did not want to numb my pain, I wanted to eliminate it altogether. The only other suggestion my doctor had was to try acupuncture. Yes, just like you, I was skeptical but after a few visits I started to feel relief. I am not living with chronic severe pain because of acupuncture. Acupuncture changed my life. I was fascinated to learn how it worked so I could help others in pain like me. I want to hear your story and help you feel the amazing benefits of this safe, effective, drug-free therapy.
