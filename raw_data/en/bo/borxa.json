COLONICS SAID TO BE WORTHLESS AND DANGEROUS In the September/Ocober NCAHF Newsletter we reported that the California Board of Medical Quality Assurance had won a decision which placed colonic irrigations outside the legal scope of practice of California chiropractors. Now, in the September 27, 1985 issue of CALIFORNIA MORBIDITY, the weekly report from the State's Infectious Disease Branch (IDB) of the Department of Health Services, it is stated : \"It is the opinion of the State's Infectious Disease Branch that neither physician's nor chiropractors should be performing colonic irrigations. We are not aware of any scientifically proven health benefit of the procedure, yet we are well aware of its hazards.\" The report then goes on to list three reports of deaths and disease outbreaks associated with the application of colonies. In its closing comments the report states that \"colonic irrigation by chiropractors, physical therapists or physicians should cease.\" NCAHF agrees with the California IDB on this and hope it will gain legal force. NCAHF fears that maverick physicians will affiliate with chiropractors and permit them to perform colonies under their medical scope of practice. There obviously are people wishing to undergo colonic irrigation either out of the misconception that the procedure has health value or for the erotic effects of this procedure--which is known to sometimes be its appeal--making offering the service lucrative. POSTAL SERVICE STOPS MARKETING OF WEIGHT-LOSS PRODUCTS Three unapproved weight-loss products-\u00ad Anorex-CCK, lntercal-SX and Metabolite-2050- -cannot be marketed through the mailing aatter a ruling by the U.S. Postal Service. Experts testified that Anorex, which contains the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) is ineffective when taken orally to curb appetite or cause weight-loss (see NCAHF NEWSLETTER, JAN/FEB, 1985). Witnesses also testified that guar, a dietary fiber which is. the active ingredient int he other two products, does not cause significant weight-loss. Under the ruling all future orders for the products will be returned to senders. The products are manufactured by three different companies, but all are owned by the same Mitchell K. Friedlander of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. (FDA CONSUMER, Dec/Jan 85-6, p.4). NEWSLETTER QUALITY IN THE HEAL TH MARKETPLACE NCAHF NEWSLETTER \"DR.\" PEPPER'S DIPLOMA MILL DEGREE RINGS ABELL Congressman Claude Pepper made TV network news on December 11 and the AP wire service on December 12 with the announcement that he had obtained phony Ph.D. in pscyhology by mail from Union University in Los Angeles. (NOTE: Union University is the same establishment that Kurt Donsbach claims to have his Ph.D. in nutrition from. Another infamous \"nutritionist'' claiming a Ph.D. from Union University is Ruth Yale Long of Houston, Texas. Long promotes questionable nutritional cancer therapies and other nonscientific notions about food. She has been very active on the talk show circuit in recent years) Mr. Pepper says that about 500,000 Americans have secured --and many are employed on the basis of--credentials they purchased but did not earn. Hopefully, this revelation will raise the consciousness of this problem and lead to some much needed reforms. CALCIUM SUPPLEMENT OVERDOSE WARNED AGAINST Calcium has recieved a great deal of attention lately, and the supplement hucksters haven't missed the opportunity to promote calcium pills to prevent osteoporsis. Indeed, this is one nutrient that seems to be lacking in the diets of many people--particulary women who don't drink enough milk. NCAHF doesn't oppose sensible supplementation, but recent evidence from studies conducted on pigs suggests that megadoses of calcium may decrease bone strength and induce internal bleeding. Some concern is also expressed about the amount of Vitamin D which might be ingested by people megadosing on calcium/vitamin D supplements. (\"Calcium: How Much Is Enough?\" NUTRITION REVIEWS, 43:345-346, Nov. 1985.) OUTLAWING MEASLES In an interesting an compelling article about the fact that measles is a eradicable disease British health workers argue that only public. policy prevent prevents the -conquest of measles. In a poignant statement addressing the issue of compulsory immunization they state: \"Legislation to prevent the spread of measles is not a denial of freedom. Rather it is a celebration of a freedom, the freedom from disease.\" (Middleton, et al. \"Measles: there ought to be a law against it.\" THE LANCET, November 23, 1985, p.1180). VOL 9, NO 1 UTAH DENTIST'S LICENSE SUSPENDED FOR AMALGAM TOXICITY CLAIMS North Ogden dentist Edwin Harrison's dental license was suspended for 5 years with all but the first 30 days of that period stayed providing he refrains from false and misleading advertising claims regarding mercury toxicity from dental fillings and practicing medicine without a license. Harrison was using an \"amalgameter'' to allegedly detect mercury leakage from amalgam restorations and prescribing compounds known as X-IT and Eaters Digest to allegedly expedite the release of mercury from fillings prior to replacement. FDA says that neither the device or products have been approved. Product promoter Hal Huggins, DDS, of Colorado Springs, say that X-IT and Eaters Digest are special dietary foods that need no FDA approval. Huggins claims that the amalgameter measures positive or negative currents from mercury amalgams which allegedly play a role in releasing mercury, and that negative current amalgams should be removed before positive ones. Huggins says that he did not have a explanation for how the process worked and that it was for scientists, not him, to determine. (ADA NEWS, November 4, 1985, pp.1-3.) AMERICAN DIETETICS ASSOCIATION WARNS OF DUBIOUS SOLICITATION The American Dietetics Association has mailed warnings to Registered Dietetians who engage in consultation and private practice that solicitation by the American Association of Nutritional Consultants (AANC) violates the signed \"label purchase and use agreement'' signed with H&M Direct Mail Advertising, Inc., the company originally purchasing the ADA list. The ADA says that they are unable to locate the individual who signed the agreement for H&M and they have discovered that H&M is no longer in business. They now believe the whole affair was a scheme to enlist Registered Dietetians in an attempt to legitimize AANC. AANC is a merger of the International Academy of Nutritional Consultants (a Kurt Donsbach creation) and the American Association of Nutritional and Dietary Consultants to which any creature with a name, $50 and an address can apparently belong--it is the association of which Victor Herbert's dog, Sassafras, and Thomas Jukes' dog, Bellman, became professional members merely on the basis of paying a $50 fee. The ADA legal counsel is investigating. The NEWSLETTER Is published bimonthly by The National Council Against Health Fraud, Inc., an all volunteer, nonprofit, tax-exempt organization.

However, because of the difference in the way health care is financed--and perhaps, in the way Britons deal with irrationality--variations exist which are interesting. The term \"holistic health\" is apparently as common there as here, but more and more the term \"complementary medicine\" is being seen in the UK literature in reference to nonscientific approaches to health care such as radionics, homeopathy, chiropractic, naturopathy, acupuncture, faith healing, and the like. An organization calling itself the Confederation of Healing Organisations (CHO), claiming over 7,000 members from diverse healing systems, wishes to set up standards for its members to \"exclude charlatans.\" The CHO also has devised a research protocol to test some of their modalities scientifically. This is a significant development to anyone who follows heterodox healing historically. In the UK heterodox -health care-enjoys the support of Prince Charles which may be one reason why it is taken more seriously and trys to act more responsibly. Serious doubt exists as to whether proponents of metaphysical healing systems can ever accept rigorous scientific controls, objectivity or acknowlege failure. It is more like that the proponents of complementary medicine will wish to offer adjunctive therapy in cooperation with conventional medicine. This way they can get by on their art (i.e., ''TLC\", taking credit for good outcomes, and placebo effects) and stay out of the kind of trouble those who attempt to sell themselves as \"alternatives\" to regular medicine. (See \"Exploring the effectiveness of healing,\" THE LANCET, November 23, 1985, p.1177-78). *Heterodox means \"contrary to or different from some acknowledged standard.\" (Webster's Dictionary). It is often used in the UK to refer to irregular medicine. INFECTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ACUPUNCTURE TREATMENT In July, 1985, the Santa Clara County (Calif.) Health Dept investigated a report regarding ---P-Seudomooas--aeruqinosa--infection-in--theea~~n a hospitalized patient who had received acupuncture treatment for diabetes. The attending physician learned of several other cases of similar nature in the county --including one case severe enough that the patient may lose his ear lobe--and reported these to the Health Dept. The subsequent investigation found the autoclave in proper working order at the acupuncture clinic, but items used in the clinic were contaminated with Pseudomonas. (CALIFORNIA MOBIDITY, Report No.42, October 25, 1985.) COMMENT: This case represents a good example of the needless, avoidable h~ caused by unproven methods of health care. There is no justification for treating diabetes with acupuncture. The harm suffered by these diabetics, as well as the money spent, was wasted. Iatrogenic diseases are one of the unfortunate aspects of any form of health care. It Is important that the hazards of iatrogenesis be limited. It seems sensible that therapeutic procedures be capable of providing some proven benefit before patients are subjected to the possibility of an iatrogenic infection. EXTENT OF VITAMIN/MINERAL SUPPLEMENT USE IN THE USA RODALE PRESS CLAIMS AS BAD AS EVER-\u00ad BUT ARE THEY LEGAL? A great deal of disparity exists on the extent of Sometimes we hear encouraging reports that vitamin/mineral supplementation use by the Rodale Press, publishers of PREVENTION public. The most recent study of this is reported magazine and ORGANIC GARDENING is in the December, 1985 issue of the JOURNAL improving the quality of the health information OF THE AMERICAN DIETETIC ASSOCIATION they offer readers. Even a study by the (Vol.85, pp.1585-1590). Stewart, et al of the American Council on Science and Health Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition measured an improvement in the accuracy of report on a national telephone survey that the health information found in PREVENTION Ot reached 2,991 adults, 16 years of age and older. went from 10% accurate in ACSH's 1982 study The methodology of this survey were of a very to 31% accurate in 1984--still low enough to be high quality and the results must be viewed as placed in the \"unreliable\" category both times). more representative of the general population However, recent mail promotions by Rodale than some of the other surveys of this question. Press reveal an appalling disregard for scientific Excluding pregnanVlactating women, 39.9% of validity. Examples of false claims for various the population consumed one or more vitamin supplements to be of benefit in diseases supplements. Of the users, 52.4% consumed are: that 86 will \"stop gallstones\", niacin \"beyond one supplement only. 10.9% the RDA\" will control glaucoma, thiamine ''for more supplements daily (up to a maximum of 14 steady nerves\", vitamin E \"may possibly (Ed. separate products). There was a wide range of real weasel words if ever!) increase your intake of both vitamins and minerals, which prospects for a long and healthy life\", relieveing extended up to 10 to 50 times the RDAs for arthritis pain with a \"certain combination of individuarnutrients. -'fturresearchers stated that ~vitamins\", Alzheirner's-\"maywell-be helped-by a it was beyond the scope of the study to examine single dose of a specific vitamin\" and more. the finding with respect to toxicity, but that \"there is a basis for concern about the high NCAHF has asked the FTC to determine levels of supplements taken by some segments whether false advertising claims of the kind of the public.\" presented above are illegal. It is generally MEGAVITAMINS NO HELP TO HYPERACTIVE CHILDREN A team of pediatricians at the University of Calgary in Alberta has reported the results of an important and intensive two-stage study of the response of hyperactive children (diagnosed as Attention Deficit Disorder) to rnegavitamin therapy as used in so-called \"orthomolecular'' treatment. They report that megadoses of niacin, ascorbic acid, pyridoxine and pantothenate had no beneficial effect on hyperactivity and were associated with gastrointestinal complaints and hepatoxicity. (NUTRITION REVIEWS, 43:105-107, April, 1985). conceded that false health information can be given in health books and magazines under free speech provisions of the First Amendment, however, advertising is considered to be \"commercial language\" and is not protected by the First Amendment. Therefore, it seems to us that while Rodale may make false and misleading statements in their publications, they may not be able to do so in their advertising for those publications. CU EVALUATES HERB TEAS Many times consumers raise questions about herbal teas. Some useful information is available in the January, 1986 issue of CONSUMER REPORTS in ''Tea: black, flavored and herbal.\" CONSUMER ALERT: BEWARE OF YELLOW PAGES. \"NUTRITIONISTS\"! A study of yellow page advertising done by NCAHF has found that only 13% of 439 self\u00ad advertised \"nutritionists\" were apparently qualified. The study included 41 areas of 17 states and covered 1982 through 1985 listings. Based upon information provided in the ads themselves they were categorized as \"clearly spurious\" (i.e., those advertising invalid methods of nutrition assessment such as hair analysis, cytotoxic testing, mail order credentials, etc.); \"suspicious\"; (e.g., chiropractors, dentists, and Ph.D.s listing themselves as nutritionists but not advertising questionable methods or credentials) \"undeterminable\"; or \"apparently qualified\" (i.e., Registered Dietetians,). 24% of spurious\"; 31% were \"suspicious\"; and, 31% \"undeterminable.\" Other listings also proved to include questionable practitioners. All fourteen practitioners listing themselves under \"Health and Diet Food Products\" provided sufficient information to be listed as \"clearly spurious.\" Even 8% of 53 individuals listed under \"Dietetians\" were categorized as \"clearly spurious\" although 55% under that listing were \"apparently qualified.\" Most shocking was the determination that 46\"/o of 24 physicians listing themselves under a \"Nutrition\" subsection of the Physicians and Surgeons\" section of the yellow pages were \"clearly spurious\" listing such questionable techniques. as chelation therapy, orthomolecular medicine orthomolecular psychology life extension and acupuncture. None of the 24 physicians could be judged as \"apparently qualified\"! The\u00b7 numbers of physicians advertising in this manner are admittedly small since it was not our original intention to include this listing. Originally, we set out to look at \"nutritionists\" and \"dietetians,\" however, some members sent along other types of listings they believed were relevant to the problem of nutrition quackery. We are also aware that many chiropractors and dentists engage in questionable. nutrition counseling. NCAHF plans to study these others in a separate, more complete analysis of this dimension of the shady health marketplace. 2 CHELATION THERAPY UNPROVEN FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE Chelation therapy Is a chemical process in which an organic compound binds with certain metals or dissolved minerals forming soluble substances that can then be excreted via the urinary system. Chelation therapy has been used for some time in detoxifying the body of various excess concentrations of metals and minerals. lrresponible physicians have also touted chelation therapy as effective therapy for coronary artery disease. More recently, with increased public awareness of Alzheimer's disease, fringe practitioners have claimed that chelation therapy could be effective in treating this 1earsome disorder. Gerontologists Marcia Cardelli, et al, discuss chelation therapy for Alzheimer's and report on two cases (see Cardelli MB, et al \"Chelation therapy: unproved modality In of Alzheimer-type dementia,\" J. AMERICAN GERIATRIC SOCIETY, 33:548-551, August, 1985). An interesting point in the report Is that \"Although the daughter did not feel the patient benefitted from chelation - therapy, she stated that she would begin treatments again in a desperate effort to do something besides watching her mother deteriorate further.\" COMMENT: This illustrates, again, the role human desperation plays in why people turn to quackery and shows why ordinary marketplace rules cannot be applied to health products and services. The daughter appears to need some emotional support and guidance in order for her to accept the reality of her mother's situation and discover just what her options were to make her mother's waning years as pleasant as possible. She doesn't need the \"hope/dispair emotional roller coaster'' offered by quackery. OUTSTANDING CONSUMER HEALTH EDUCATION BOOK Kurt Butler, MS and Lynn Rayner, MD have collaborated on THE BEST MEDICINE: THE COMPLETE HEALTH AND PREVENTIVE MEDICINE HANDBOOK, published by Harper & Row, San Francisco, no pages. The book covers exercise and fitness, nutrition science and mythology, healthy s~~ _an_d reproduction, common disorders, drugs and health, controversial alternatives, and how to go about consulting a physician. The authors are well informed and hard hitting on quackery. They seem to have caught on to the fact that health promotion must be balanced with caveats about quackery. Kurt Bulter is associated with the Quackery Action Council, NCAHF's affiliate in Hawaii. This book is outstanding and deserves strong promotion. FOOD SENSITIVITY PRIMER Wrth all of the food allergy/sensitivity scams around these days it Is helpful to have some guidance on the scientifically based realities of these disorders. Such is available in the October 5, 1985 issue of the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL (Vol.291, pp.951-955). The article, \"Food sensitivity,\" by Truswell covers definitions of terms, diagnosis, dietary manipulation techniques, clinical reactions, and more. Some handy charts and tables of practical information are provided. BLUE-GREEN MANNA RUNS AFOUL OF THE LAW \"Blue-Green Manna\" is an algae product promoted by Victor Kollman in Klamath Falls, Oregon (see CCAHF NEWSLETTER, 5:6:3, Nov/Dec, 1982). Kollman's operation was stopped by a temporary court order in November, 1985. Kollman and his distributors have made claims that algae could have a \"marked effect\" of such problems as alcoholism, herpes, Alzheimer's disease, strokes, arthritis, hay fever, diabetes, hypoglycemia and emphysema. Kollman claims to have a doctorate in biochemsitry from Utah State University, but FDA Attorney Lawrence G. McDade offered evidence In court that Utah State has no record of such a degree. McDade also also says that Kollman was fired from his job as an investigator at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1982 for practicing medicine. McDade called the health claims for Kollman's algae products ''totally fraudulent.\" Kollman testified that the algae costs about$50 per pound to produce and that it is sold for as much as $300 per pound through a multilevel marketing scheme. The algae company is said to contibute about $1 million annually to the local economy of Klamath Falls. (Leeson, Fred. \"Algae-pill evidence conflicting,\" THE OREGONIAN, Jan 10, 1986. p.E6, 4M). CHIROPRACTORS VICTIMS OF AND CONSPIRATORS WITH UNSCRUPULOUS MEDICAL DOCTORS A few unscrupulous medical doctors have come up with a new way to cheat Medicare and the insurance industry. By setting up a partnership with chiropractors. Not all MD/DC partnerships are fraudulent. Some involve comprehensive back care clinics which can take advantage of a broad range of approaches to patients with back disorders (i.e., manipulative therapy, prescription muscle-relaxant drugs, and other forms of medical treatment). However, NCAHF has become aware of arrangements wherein medical doctors set up an overbilling scam using a chiropractic practice as the front and fall-guy. It goes something like this: The MDs approach a DC offering to work with him. The DC is generally flattered that an MD is willing to acknowledge a chiropractor as a health professional and assumes that the offer has been made in good faith. The MDs agree to work a certain number of hours and conduct medical examinations on the DCs patients. The MDs go through the DCs patient files and pick out those patients who have insurance coverage. The examinations turn out to be superficial or never performed but billed-\u00ad excessly priced at that--to a third party payer through the DC's practice. The MDs take most of the money and the DC takes most of the responsibility for the fraud. In some cases the MDs may be unlicensed practitioners who wish to find a licensed health care provider they can work under. In other cases, the DC's services will be billed as medical services using the MD's federal tax ID numbers Increasing the billing by as much as 70%. Some DCs naively advertise and promote their newly expanded service offerings only to find themselves victims who have helped victimize their patients. MD/DC practice arrangements deserve careful scrutiny by licensing boards, fraud investigators, consumers and providers. 3 QUACKS SAID TO BE ORGANIZING According to a report in the newsletter NATURAL MEDICINE (formerly ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE DIGEST), December, 1985, Roy Kupsinel, MD of Florida has founded the American Quack Association (AQA). Kupsinel reportedly has \"gathered a small group of like\u00ad minded physicians to form the AQA and they will publish their own journal. AQA hopes to remove some of the stigma from the word \"quack\" by clalming that most American physicians would qualify as quacks under the definition put forth by the Pepper Committee (i.e., \"anyone who promotes medical schemes or remedies known to be false ... or unproven, for a profit''). Kupsinel quotes the U.S. Office of Technology Assessment as stating that as few as 10% of medical treatments have been proved effective in controlled studies. It is easy enough to challenge the 10% figure cited by Kupsinel In terms of how such a figure could be ascertained. Is it In terms of 10% of all patients treated, medications prescribed or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopea, or what. Regardless of the difficulties of establishing the numerical basis for Kupsinel's claim, the main flaw in his reasoning lies in a failure to differentiate between the promotion of a method and its use experimentally or empirically. All experimental procedures are unproven or they wouldn't be experimental. Responsible rearchers do not promote unproven methods in the regular health marketplace. They invite critical peer review and follow careful protocols which soon lead to an objective determination of whether or not the procedure is safe and effective for the intended purpose. Physicians may also employ procedures empirically that are unproven for a particular condition. This may be done in cases of chronic diseases for which there is no single therapy of choice but a chance that the procedure may have value. Here again there is a difference between this type of empiricism and the way quacks behave. Responsible physicians will not actively promote unproven methods in the health marketplace as preferable to other methods, claim such are effective on the basis of testimonials or inadequate evidence, attack conventional medicine as misguided or conspiring to withhold this ''wonder medicine\" out of self-interest, or write a popular book and go on the talk show circuit to ''take his case to the public\" who are ill-equipped to judge the validity of health claims. Quacks do more than simply apply unproven methods from time to time, they promote them using the methods of salesmanship not science. MAGAZINES AND DIETARY ADEQUACY The nutrient intakes of 100 undergraduate students were calculated trom two-day dietary records, and a mean adequacy ratio was derived for each. Data collected also included magazines selected for nutrition information by participants. Positive relationships between dietary adequacy and the 1982 American Council on Science and Health rating of the validity of the nutrition information provided were observed. The need for judicious selection of magazines when relying upon them as a source of nutrition information was supported by the findings. (Vickery, et al. \"Relationship of magazines selected as sources of nutrition information and dietary adequacy,\" HEALTH VALUES, 9:13-15, Nov/Dec, 1985). AUSTRALIAN COUPLE FACES CHARGES IN FASTING DEATH OF THEIR CHILD A Malvern, Australia couple, Joanne Eaton, 24 and Thomas Barnes, 26, face charges on having unlawfully killed their daughter, 3 1/2 year-old Rebecca, by placing her on a 27-day fast Barnes . and Eaton are described as \"devotees of a strict dietary regime,\" and Barnes is reportedly a student of a retired naturopath, Kenneth Jaffrey. The Coroner, Mr. Anthony Ellis, said that he found that little Rebecca and been placed on a three-day fast in April, broken by one day on which she was given fruit and carob. She was then palced on a 27-day fast during which she received only distilled water. That fast was broken on May 19 at which time the child was given pear juice ... her death occurred the next day. The Coroner directed that Barnes and Eaton be charged with manslaughter at the Melbourne Supreme Court. (Fincke M and Horne C. \"Parents to trial over fast death,\" THE HERALD (Melbourne, Australia), Dec. 5, 1985, p.3). THE NATIONAL COUNCIL AGAINST HEALTH FRAUD, INC. P.O.

New York State is an exception. Legislators in the Knickerbocker \u00b7 St;ate have been holding hearings and investiga~ons, and appear to be on the way to drafting some landmark legislation that will curtail health fraud abuses. Among those testifying before the Assembly Republican Task Force on Health Fraud and the Elderly in December were NCAHF board member Victor Herbert, MD, JD, and the leaders of the NCAHF New York chapter, John Dodes, DDS and Marvin Schissel, DDS. NCAHF will be watching New York and will publicize any special anti-health fraud legislation which might be forthcoming. American Council on Science & Health Director: Elizabeth Whelan.

Several NCAHF members were in attendance at the 31st Annual National Health Federation (NHF) conv\u00ad ention held at the Pasadena (Calif) Convention Center, January 17-19, 1986, to hear the leadership of the National Health Federation (NHF), including President Kurt Donsbach, DC, Maureen Salaman and Clinton Miller, maliciously attack NCAHF and sware to destroy it and its influence. Ors. Jarvis, Barrett and Herbert were compared to \"Hitler, Goering and Goebl es\" and NCAHF was posed as being linked to the \"pharmaceutical and medical monopoly.\" Dr. Jarvis was given NHF's first \"Health Bigot of the Year Award\" in NHF's words \"for exhibiting extreme intolerance toward those who do not share his personal health dogmas, . and for aggressively organizing and urging others to behave likewise.\" Clinton Miller, NHF's Washington lobbyist, organized a special meeting on Friday, January 17, to which all of the Seventh-day Adventists in the crowd were invited. 20-30 people listened to Miller's plan to destroy NCAHF's support by Loma Linda University (and perhaps get William Jarvis fired from the LLU faculty?). Miller composed a form letter which was distributed that began: \"Does Dr. Wi 11 i am Jarvis speak for the Seventh Day Adventists (sic)? An open letter to all Seventh Day Adventist (sic) presidents, pastors and members.\" The letter that followed is a recital of the kinds of distortions for which Miller is famous~ The Adventists present\u00b7 were urged to place these form letters under the windshield wipers of church members during Sabbath services. Miller often tries to pose ,consumer protection efforts as an infringement upon religious freedom. For instance, when the Postal authorities wanted to curtail the dissemination of false health information via the mail, Miller accused them of attempting to. \"ban the Bible\"! And, when dietetian's attempts to stop the fraudulent activities of unqualifed \"nutrition-ists\" who prey on consumers, Miller accused them of trying to interfer with the eating habits of people that are based upon religious convictions. Mi11er admitted to Dr. Jarvis in a personal conv\u00ad ersation that his crusade to make quackery appe~r to be a holy cause and cast anyone who opposes it as unAmerican is based upon his personal Mormon beliefs that humans \"come down to this earth to exercise free agency.\" To Miller this apparently means that there should be no restrictions on what people do, hence, his strong advocacy of so-called \"health freedom\"--which NCAHF interprets as meaning \"a hunt fog 1 i cense for quackery.\" Miller's personal religion (he admitted that some of his Mormon brethren tell him that he \"goes too far\") apparently permits the thievery, child\u00ad killing, and other exploits of quackery as justified in the name of some higher purpose. Revealing a siege-mentality, Miller says he regards those who disgree with him as \"enemies\" and \"bombards them with (verbal) mortarfire just like the Germans did to him when he was a soldier in World War II.\" Miller takes an \"all is fair in war\" morality and uses as his \"bombs\" the big lie, character assassination, and the dirty tricks commonly employed by extremists. \"There is nothing personal in all of this,\" Miller says, \"but when you are the enemy, we have to clobber you!\" (apparently his version of the Christian principle of loving your enemies). FLORIDA CHAPTER ll ORGANIZING NCAHF members in the State of Florida are in the process of incorporating a chapter. The group has drawn together health and legal professionals as well as others in the State wishing to actively oppose health misinformation, fraud and quackery. Florida is one of the focal points of quackery in the nation because of its weak consumer protection laws and high concentration of well-to-do elderly. Members wishing to join the F1orida chapter write or phone: Clara Lawhead, RD, Pasco County Health Dept., P.O. Box 160, New Port Richey, FL 33552.

NUTRITION QUACKERY PREVENTION PROGRAM ESTABLISHED The San Bernardino County (Calif} Department of Public Health has established a Nutrition Quackery Prevention Program to combat nutrition m.isinforma\u00ad tion and quackery in its area. A broad representation of community -agencies will participate in a Nutrition Quackery Prevention Task Force. The project is under the direction of Carla Bouchard, RD, MS, Nutrition Program Manager for SB County, and Public Health Nutritionist Robin Nishiwaki, RD, MPH. The first meetfng is scheduled for February 5. NCAHF BOARD MEMBER CHALLENGES TRADE GROUP The Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) is a trade association of \u00b7 nutritional supplement suppliers. CRN claims to have disassociated itself from the food faddists and rip-off nutritionists. NCAHF Board member, Grace Monaco, JD, has written to CRN and challenged them to \"(a) join in current efforts of the government and others to expose and close down nutrition diploma mills, and (2) to provide support to one of the outstanding home study organizations with accreditation to develop an appropriate nutrition home study program in cooperaUon with an accredited university training RDs and PhDs tn nutrition to provide a course of study for lower level nutrition consultants that could be licensed and accredited.\" VICTOR HERBERT ASSUMES NEW POSITION As of December 1, 1985, Victor Hertbert, MD, JD, is Professor of Medicine and Chairman of the Committee to Strengthen Nutrition (a committee for the Nutrition Center) of Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.

Congratula\u00ad tions and thanks to Cheryl for her achievement and commitment to helping consumers protect themselves. QAC HOLDS PiREWALK The Quackery Action Council (QAC), NCAHF's Hawaii affiliate, -conducted a public demonstration of fire-walking on December 14, 1985 at Ala Moana Park in Honolulu. The purpose of the demonstration was to expose claims that firewalking requires some sort of psychic powers. QAC pointed to the \"Fear Into Power\" personal improvement seminars conducted by the Robbins Research Institute of California. People pay Robbins $125 apiece for a six-hour seminar which concludes with each attempting to muster the courage to walk on hot coals while chanting \"Cool moss! Cool moss!\". QAC leaders Alicia Leonard and Kurt Butler~ along with four friends, walked repeated over the coals and offered the experience for free along with a rational explanation for the phenomenon. Alicia chanted, \"Hot coals! Quack, quack!\" as she wen~. (Lynch, HONOLULU STAR\u00ad BULLETIN & ADVERTISER, Dec.15, 1985) DENTAL QUACKERY John E.

NCAHF NEWSLETTER VOL 9 NO 2 CONSUMER'S REPORTS EXPOSES THE FOLK MEDICINE AND QUACKERY EARL MINDELL'$ VITAMIN DOSAGES MERCURY DENTAL FILLINGS SCAM The March, 1986 issue of CONSUMER REPORTS contains the best description and evaluation of the current claims regarding the safety of mercury-containing dental amalgam fillings. Included are important facts such as information on the device used by promoters to convince patients that their amalgams are hazardous. The device, a mercury-vapor analyzer, Is designed for use In factories, is calibrated to extrapolate its sample to an occupational setting. It does this by multiplying the sample by 80001 Blood and urine levels, which provide the best Indication of mercury body burden, do not support the contentions of the dental amalgam replacers. CU also profiles some of the leading actors in the amalgam toxicity promotion. This Is the best article we've seen on the topic. It should be made widely available to dental consumers. Another good basic article on mercury pollution and sources of mercury in food Is \"Mercury In fish\" by Thomas H. Jukes, PhD, DSc, JAMA, 233~1001-1002, 1975 .. Anyone interested in the dental mercury saga will find this article of value. STUDY FINDS NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HAIR-MERCURY AND DENTAL FILLINGS A study of a random sample of people In Madrid, Spain, found, among other things, that there was no significant variations In hair mercury (a valid method of assessing body load over time) with regard to sex, age or dental fillings. (5ee: Gonzalez MJ, et al, \"Mercury In human hair: a study of residents in . Madrid, Spain,\" ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH, 40:225-228, 1985). DENTIST PAYS PATIENT $100,000 FOR UNNECESSARY AMALGAM REPLACEMENT Using a Dermatron device a dentist advised a 55-year-old patient that six of her asymptomatic and non-pathological amalgam fillings were a \"llability'' to her large Intestines and should be removed. Five of the fillings were replaced. The Patient subsequently suffered pulpal irritation resulting in two root canals and the extraction of two teeth. The patient sued alleging that consent was fraudulently induced. The settlement was for $100,000. (Sonoma County Superior Court, No.134740, March 1, 1985). Folk medicine is not synonymous with quackery, but It is clear to even the casual observer that some connection exists. Several recent articles are Instructive on the relationship between folk medicine and quackery. Historian James Harvey Young's monograph \"Folk Into Fake\" reveals how quacks have taken advantage of folk beliefs and marketed \"country cures\" and folk medicines. Insight Into the uncritical acceptance of commercialized folk medicine may be found In\u00b7 the 9bservation by Freldson that \" .. .folk practitioners merely specialize In what everyone knows; with no significant difference In conception of Illness and treatment separating them from their patients'' (in K Finkler, \"The nonsharing of medical knowledge among spiritualist healers and their patients: a contribution to the study of Intra\u00ad cultural diversity and practitioner-patient relationship,\" MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY, Summer,.1984). Finkler shows that patients do not completely agree nor comply with with folk healers--which should make physicians feel a little better about noncompliance by their patients--but cleariy do share basic notions about health and disease which are traditional. A third article by Halpern C'Trust, talk and touch in Balkan folk healing,\" SOC. SCI. MED, 21:319--325, 1985) provides insights on how these factors work in the actual delivery of care by folk healers. It ls clear that the methods of naturopaths, chiropractors, therapeutic touch practitioners, reflexologlsts, faith healers and other nonscientific health providers share much with folk healers. Students of the psychodynamlcs of quackery will find these articles of value. INSIGHTS ON RATIONAL CHIROPRACTIC PRACTICES A very useful monograph describing the proper practice of rational chiropractic care has been produced by Drs. Charies E. DuVall, DC (Sr. and Jr.) of Akron, Ohio, as an aid to Insurance adjusters who must verify provider claims. Anyone interested In the upgrading of chiropractic services will find this document worthwhile. The Piece was published In the OCCUPATION MEDICINE AND LEGAL SOURCEBOOK, 2:1-32, September, 1985.

Ask for \"Rational Chiropractic Practice.\" CHALLENGED In a USA TODAY story which ran on January 22, 1986, pharmacist Eari Mindell, owner of the Great Earth Nutrition Store chain (Editor's note: Mindell claims to hold a PhD In nutrition, but his alleged degree Is .from an unaccredited school, Beverly Hills University), recommends that if your quitting smoking you should Ingest 10,000 mg of vitamin A dally. In a follow-up letter published on January 28 In USA TODAY, Dr. Thomas Jukes notes that since one unit of vitamin A = .3 micrograms the dosage recommended by Mindell is 600 times the toxic dose of 50,000 units per day established by the National Academy of Sciences. The Editors note that \"Eari Mindell defends his doses.\" EFFECTS OF UNCONVENTIONAL EATING PRACTICES REVIEWED Among the most worrisome aspects of food faddlsm are the effects of faddist eating practices on infants and children. Rhona Hanning, PhD candidate in Nutrition -at the University of Toronto and Stanley Zlotkin, MD, PhD, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at the same University have teamed up in a review of a wide variety of unconventional eating practices that have health implications particulariy for children. Topics covered Include vegetarianism, Zen Macrobiotic Diets, fast foods, vitamin toxicity, megavitamins, \"health foods\", fad diets In infancy, and elimination diets. General management guidelines for dealing with people are provided. (Hanning and Zlotkln, \"Unconventional eating practices and their health Implications,\" PEDIATRIC CLINCIS OF NORTH AMERICA, 32:429-445, 1985). THE MIRACLE OF EVERYDAY HEALING Everyday healing is a remarkable phenomenon and love attention can aid it, say Paul Brand. MD and CHRISTIANITY TODAY editor Philip Yancey, but expecting the extraordinary can be dangerous, they warn. Undue emphasis on divine healing causes more sorrow than joy, the authors state. They also point out that remissions occur among Christians and non\u00ad Christians, with prayer and without prayer. This useful article appeared in the JOURNAL OF CHRISTIAN NURSING, Spring, 1985).

CALIFORNIA PHYSICIAN SENTENCED FOR CANCER FRAUD Grand Terrace physician Bruce Halstead who was convicted in October, 1985 of 24 counts of cancer fraud and grand theft was sentenced on March 21 to four years in prison and a $10,000 fine. \u00b7 Compton (Calif.) Superior Court Judge Marvin D. Rowan, who described Halstead as \"cruel and callous for exploiting vulnerable people from his position of trust,\" said he might reduce the sentence if Halstead drops all medical activities, research and the title of doctor. Deputy District Attorney Hyatt Seligman, who had sought a 6-year term for Halstead said that he thought the sentence was fair. Seligman added that he hopes this case will serve as a deterrent to other health care providers trafficking in cancer fraud. Purcell Daniels, the deputy probation officer who interviewed Halstead says that the physician should go to prison because he showed no remorse and acted out of greed. (SAN BERNARDINO SUN, March 22, 1986). COMMENT: NCAHF has been aware of the activities of Bruce Halstead for many years since he operated within a short distance of Loma Linda. Halstead has blatantly promoted DMSO, laetrile chelation therapy for arteriosclerosis, liefcort, and other questionable practices. Because of his reputation as one of the world's leading authorities on marine toxicology, he lent credibility to other nonscientific practitioners in who's defense he often testified as an expert medical witness. Halstead also served for a time on the National Health Federation's Board of Governors. Halstead has attempted to justify his actions followrng mscorWiction and finds many outlets for his pleadings. SPOTLIGHT, a publication of the right-wing political organization Liberty Lobby, champions questionable methods of cancer management and its practitioners. In Its January 20, 1986 issue, writer Tom Valentine takes up Halstead's cause misrepresenting the law under which Halstead was convicted as making it Illegal for any physician to give \"nutritional support''* to a cancer patient and repeating Halstead's charges that it was pressure from NCAHF that got him prosecuted (although NCAHF applauds Halstead's prosecution, conviction and sentencing, we cannot claim credit for any of it--credit is due the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office and others). PREVENTIVE HEALTH NEWS, a Las Vegas, Nevada-based tabloid published by a major promoter of DMSO, presented Bruce Halstead's version of this case in its January, 1986 edition. *It is currently popular for cancer quacks to claim that they are merely giving patients nutritional support for the purpose of enhancing their immune system's ability to fight off the disease. Their purpose \u00b7 appears to be an attempt to circumvent the laws requiring therapeutic regimens to be proven both safe and effective. Laws governing nutritional practices are less demanding. However, when the above claim is made, the claimant merely describes the mechanism of action whereby the treatment supposedly works. The regimen becomes therapeutic by its intended purpose. If this were not so even methotrexate, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, might be cnsidered \"nutritional\" because its mechanism of action is to block folic acid metabolism within the cells. INTIMIDATION LAWSUIT BY RAW MILK PRODUCER THROWN OUT OF COURT Stating that Alta Dena Dairy's charges against San Francisco physician John Bolton lacked merit, Marin County (Calif) Judge Henry Broderick dismissed a $110 million defamation lawsuit brought by the company. The dairy, which is said to be the nation's largest grossing at least $100 million in annual sales (this Includes many pasteurized products as well), clalmed that Bolton and the American Academy of Pediatrics has \"recklessly'' defamed the company by claiming that its \"certified\" raw milk has been contaminated by dangerous bacteria and is a threat to public health. (MARIN INDEPENDENT JOURNAL, February 13, 1986, p.A-7). Aita Dena Dairy has legal problems of its own. A court injunction was Issued in January, 1986, against the company's advertising that certified raw milk was safe for infants, the Ill and other vulnerable groups unless the ads contained the following warning: \"Raw certified milk products may contain dangerous bacteria. \u00b7 Those facing the highest risk of disease or death include babies and young children, pregnant women, the elderly, those with cancer or reduced Immunity and those taking cortisone, antibiotics or antacids. Questions concerning the use of raw milk products should be directed to your physician.\" The court's action resulted from a lawsuit filed by Consumer's Union, the California Grey Panthers and the American Public Health Association. The company took the Fifth Amendment during the hearing. (From: _ <::ON$UMER$_ J,J_NION ~EWS, contact Elizabeth Laporte (415)391-8100). CONTROVERSIAL ARTHRITIS REMEDIES Arthritis sufferers provide a never-ending target for quackery.

WEIGHT-LOSS FIRM FINED $500,000 A group of Canoga Park, California, mail-order companies paid a $500,000 fine for false and misleading advertising in January, 1986. The product was called Amitol/Am and contained glucomannan, a methylcellulose-llke substance made from Japanese konjac root and alleged to produce dramatic weight-loss. The company's ads included before and after pictures of a woman who claimed to have lost 51 pounds In six weeks--which is physically impossible without surgery. In fact, the woman was the company's president and the pictures were taken on the same day. In the \"before\" picture she wore a robe and was apparently stuffed with padding. In the \"after\" picture she wore a swimsuit. The bad news is that the company earned a net profit of $3.5 million on sales of $9 million during the ten months it operated. (LOS ANGELES TIMES, January 31, 1986). 2 \"CLINICAL ECOLOGY\" CRITICALLY EVALUATED BY CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION TASK FORCE In 1981 the California Medical Association (CMA) adopted the position that clinical ecology does not constitute a valid medical discipline and that scientific and clinical evidence to support the diagnosis of \"environmental stress\" and \"cerebral allergy'' or the concept of massive environmental allergy is lacking. As a result of request from self-proclaimed clinical ecologists for an opportunity to present evidence justifying their diagnostic and treatment methods, the CMA appointed a task force in 1984 to review clinical ecology. The CMA Task Force on Clinical Ecology published its report in the February, 1986, WESTERN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE, (144:239- 245). It states: Clinical ecology is based upon two main hypotheses: first, that the total load of low-dose environmental stressors is Important in the induction of illness; and second, that changes in the frequency of and interals between exposures to specific substances can mask the clinical manifestations of or alter the degree of sensitivity to those substances. Treatment methods used by clinical ecologists include avoidance, symptom-neutralizing doses of diluted extract of allegedly offending agents, rotation diets and an ecologically sound workplace and home. The Task Force's conclusions are that (1) there is no convincing evidence that supports the hypotheses on which clinical ecology is based. (2) Clinical ecologists have not identified specific, reeognizable-- diseases caused by -\u00b7 exposure to low level-environmental stressors. (3) Methods to diagnose and treat such undefined conditions have not been shown to be effective. (4) The practice of clinical ecology can be considered experimental only when Its practitioners adhere to scientifically sound research protocols and inform their patients about the experimental nature of their practice.

DANGERS OF IMMUNOAUGMENTATIVE THERAPY DESCRIBED lmmunoaugmentative Therapy (IAT) is a questionable cancer treatment that until recently was offered by zoologist Lawrence Burton, PhD at Freeport, Bahamas. The therapy consists of serum measurements of certain alleged \"immune deficiencies\" and purportedly restores immune function by injecting products derived from tumor tissue and blood from individuals with and without cancer. IAT represents a potentially serious public health risk since it is capable transmitting hepatitis B and AIDS. The public is warned that both the efficacy and safety of IAT are in serious question. (Curt GA, et al, JAMA, 255:505-507, 1986). According to an Associated Press story dated Jnauary 16, 1986, the Burton Clinic may reopen soon in Cuernevaca, Mexico. The story quotes Burton himself who was In New York to testify at a hearing conducted by Rep. Guy Molinari. \"FIT FOR LIFE\"--A BAD BOOK; PERHAPS A GOOD GAUGE OF NATIONAL NUTRITION IGNORANCE! The best-selling book FIT FOR LIFE by Harvey and Marilyn Diamond has prompted a large number of inquiries In recent months. NCAHF exposed the fallacies of the Diamond's approach to food combining in its March/April, 1983 Newsletter. Our examination of the book caused us to remark that, although we could find nothing overtly dangerous in It, the book seems unprecedented in the amount of misinformation contained. Further, the type of misinformation is so fundamental to basic nutrition and physiology that It is appalling that a book like this can become a best seller in the last half of the twentieth century. We would like to suggest that Its only socially redeeming feature is that It may be a good gauge of the nation's ignorance on health and nutrition and could be used to alert American educators of their failure to impart the most fundamental knowledge about these essential topics to citizens while under their care. Several book reviews have now been published which agree with our assessment. ENVIRONMENTAL NUTRITION newsletter reviewed FIT FOR LIFE in the February, 1986, issue. Its summary states: \" ... the accuracy of this book's advice is inconsistent and espouses too many false notions. Although probably not dangerous, FIT FOR LIFE has the potential to be unhealthy and therefore is not recommended.\" Nutrition specialist Susan Davis and University of Maine Professor of Nutrition Katherine Musgrave analyzed the FIT FOR LIFE diet by computer and found It to be deficient in calcium, zinc, vitamin D and Vitamin B12. They state that the diet is not safe for children, adolescents, pregnant or breast-feeding mothers. Kathy DeMaggio, RD, reviewed the book in the NAPA (California) REGISTER, in the February 12 edition. DeMaggio Identifies three significant areas of misinformation in the book. The basic fallacies of '1oxic waste\" buildup and \"food combining\" which make no physiological sense whatever; the misinformation that fruit \"contains all of the nutrients needed by man\"; and the prohibition against dairy products. All seem to agree that people could lose weight on the diet because It restricts food intake. The Diamonds state that they were educated at the American College of Health Science in Austin, Texas. Information NCAHF has gathered on the American College of Health Science in Austin, Texas, is that the \"school\" is a post office box. It is unaccredited and may be operating illegally in the State of Texas. It is an extension of an unaccredited naturopathic \"school\" in Ridgedale, Missouri, operated by T.C. Fry. The American College of Health Science was formerly the College of Life Science. The \"school\" promotes the pseudoscientific notions of the late naturopath Herbert Shelton. Shelton's San Antonio, Texas \"health school\" was successfully sued for $853,000 in 1982 by the widow of a Los Altos, California man who died following a 30-day distilled water diet administered at the \"school\" (See CCAHF NEWSLETTER, Sept/Oct 1982, p.1}. The institution closed In 1982 and there Is some reason to believe that the Missouri operation may be its successor. The \"college\" boasts facilities for eight students and does most of its educating by mail. BOOK ON CHIROPRACTIC MALPRACTICE AVAILABLE Peter J. Modde, DC, an NCAHF Advisor, has worked for many years to reform chiropractic malpractice. He has published an excellent manual (CHIROPRACTIC MALPRACTICE, Columbia, MD: Hanrow Press, 1985) on how to deal with the problem of inappropriate treatment by chiropractors. The manual contains basic information on suitable chiropractic care and case studies of past malpractice cases Dr. Modde has been involved with. The book is well done and should be valuable to attorneys, educators, responsible chiropractors and others interested in the problem. Available from Hanrow Press, Inc., Dept Z, Box 1093, Columbia, (301)964- 3510. 1986 NCAHF PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE ANTIFLUORIDATION MATERIAL DEBUNKED The American Oral Health Institute has published its first book, ABUSE OF THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE IN AN ANITFLUORIDATION PAMPHLET, by Coleen Wulf, Karen Hughes, Kathleen Smith and Michael Easley. The 178-page book directly evaluates 250 citations used by John Yiamouyannis in his antifluoridatlon pamphlet, \"Lifesavers Guide to Fluoridation.\" The book Is a must for dental and public health professionals and others interested in fluoridation. The size of the publication and obvious amount of effort that went Into it provide an example of just how much effort is required to debunk pseudoscience. The book may be ordered from the American Oral Health Institute, P.O. Box 151528, Columbus, OH 43215. (Presented by NCAHF Persident William Jarvis at the 1986 Annual Meeting held February 14, 1986 at Loma Linda, CA) Last year I noted in my message to the NCAHF membership that 1984 was the year the nation rediscovered quackery and that 1985 promised to be a year of legislative challenges ... particularly with regard to the Pepper Bills. The National Health Federation was so concerned about the passage of effective antiquackery legislation that they mortgaged their headquarters building to raise lobbying funds. NHF leaders made major efforts to buttonhole Mr. Pepper. NHF President Maureen Salaman went so far as to buy a plane ticket on a flight with Mr. Pepper and arranging .to have her seat assignment next to him and bent his ear all the way to his destination. NHF leaders believed that they had thwarted the antiquackery movement In Washington, but subsequent events have proved them wrong and it appears as if they still haven't figured out what is going on. NHF is thrashing around like a blinded viper trying to discover who is keeping the antiquackery momentum going. They've come to believe that it is NCAHF that is responsible and have launched a vicious attack through the network of extremists which make up NHF and its friends. So far we have seen the dirty tricks and disinformation of Lisa, Null, Valentine and Miller. These self-proclaimed defenders of ''freedom\" have shown their true colors as they seek to squelch the free expression of people who do not share their philosophy of a Caveat Emptor (i.e., \"let the buyer beware') health marketplace. They are going off half-cocked, without facts, falsely posing NCAHF as aligned with organized medicine, the pharmaceutical industry and sinister forces aimed at depriving people of \"health freedom.\" Their charges are groundless, but the \"Big Lie\" tactic is to repeat the lie often enough so that people begin to think there must be something to it. NCAHF believes in free choice to a far greater extent than NHF. The purpose of providing people with the adverse truths about questionable health products and services is to enable them to make good\u00b7 choices. Future issues of the Newsletter will carry the statement \"enhancing freedom of choice through reliable information\" to clearly make this point. 1986 promises to be a year of trials and tribulations. So be It. One thing experience has taught is that adversity builds strength and mobilizes people to action. I believe the attention the attacks by organized quackery will bring can give NCAHF additional impetus in this crucial year in which increased growth Is essential to our survival. All of us who feel a social responsibility to take an active role against health fraud, misinformation and quackery realize that we place ourselves in a position to take the darts and arrows of the mean-minded proponents of quackery. We must remain courageous. Principle and truth are on our side. Principle in the form of the hard-won consumer protection laws of this century: requirements for accurate labeling, truthful advertising, and proof of both safety and effectiveness before marketing health products and services--with the burden of proof on proponents. I believe that the public desires and expects these standards in the health marketplace and that is why they have supported laws to that effect. It Is only when consumers are misled into believing that quack nostrums are being accurately described, truthfully advertised, and are safe and effective that they clamor for them. It is essential that we keep these principles before the public rather than becoming distracted by false issues such as perverted notions of \"health freedom.\" Truth is on our side because we are on its side. The scientific mehtod is the process whereby truth is determined. If raw milk is safe and laetrile is effective--or if pasteurization and conventional cancer therapy are wrong--let it be shown to be so scientifically and NCAHF will comply. NCAHF has but one perspective--the consumer's right to worthwhile health products and services. It is my hope that the NCAHF leadership and membership will rally in 1986 to make this our best year ever. 3 THE VITAMIN \u00b7 PUSHERS--ANOTHER CONSUMER REPORTS EXPOSE' Consumer's Union outdid themselves with their March, 1986 edition of CONSUMER REPORTS. Their cover story, \"The Vitamin Pushers\" reveals the involvement of pharmceutical companies and drugstores in the overpromotion of vitamin supplementation. The article also calls Into serious question the Joint campaign of the FDA and Pharmaceutical advertising Council which advises consumers to \"ask your pharmacist\" about health product claims that sound too good to be true. While registered pharmacists are clearly qualified to provide good information, the CR article provides evidence that they often will sell questionable supplements instead. Expecting pharmacists who have direct conflict\u00ad of-interest (represented on their store shelves as supplements} to provide noncommercial advice to consumers seems naive. This matter raises an age-old issue among pharmacists as to whether their services should be limited to professional pharmacies, not part of the retail drugstore business. The CR article provides ample evidence that vitamin advertising by the pharmaceutical industry is misleading and promotes unnecessary supplementation. popular course on miracles that Included a laboratory session in which students were purportedly healed of various maladies. The course reportedly drew a maximum 250 students each time it was taught since 1982. Faculty member, Jack Rogers, stated that the course was the most deeply devisive course he'd seen In 15 years at the school. Fuller is a conservative protestant seminary with a predominantly Presbyterian tone based upon rational thought The seminary's School of Theology decided not to permit students to take the course because of the questions raised by the healings In the absence of authentication. Questions among the students about the nature of Biblical healing, apparent heatings in the course (none were serious illnesses} and other questions has prompted lively discussion among the students and faculty and it is hoped by many that the course will return in the future, perhaps, modified to remove some of the past objections.

NEWSLETTER Box 1276, Loma Linda, CA 92354 ADDRESS CORRECTION REQUESTED FORWARDING AND RETURN POSTAGE GUARANTEED 4 Non-Profit Organization U.S. POSTAGE PAID Loma Linda, CA Permit No. 4B T H E NCAHF BULLETIN BOARD MARCH/ APRIL, 1986 LETTERS OF SUPPORT NEEDED The National Health Federation has launched a vicious personal attack on NCAHF Pres id'ent Wi 111 am Jarvis. \"Does Dr. Jarvis represent the Seventh Day Adventists?\" shouts from the cover of the Feb, 1986 HEALTH FREEDOM NEWS. Inside is a distorted account of NCAHF and its activities. A cut-out form letter vi llifyi ng Dr. Jarvis is provided that readers are encouraged to send to church officials and make copies to be passed out at church. There is a sufficient number of Adventists engaged in the health foods business, nonscientific health care practitioners (i.e., chiropractors, naturopaths and medical mavericks) and misguided lay people to provide NHF with zealots to do their bidding. Of course, sensible church people immediately recognize such tactics as dirty tricks and put it in proper perspective, however, some take the matter seriously and harass church officials. Like the Mormons ( see \"Mormons and quackery\"), the ____ Sev~nth-dzy Adventist church develooed_during~ the . last century and antimedical statements by early church leaders are often taken out of historical context to condemn today's health sciences. Unlike the Mormons, the Adventist church has not made official pr-onouncements condemning quackery, but the\u00b7 fact that the church operates a world-wide scientifically-based medical system speaks for itself. The LLU Medical Center and the present Adventist health care system is regarded as misguided by some Adventists--who are likely to sympathize with NHF. Although the NHF attack is aimed at Dr. Jarvis, its real objective is to make LLU administrators uncomfortable about the fact NCAHF operates from the campus. The entire NHF premise is false fn that NCAHF is nonsectarian and nonpolitical and has no official connection with LLU or the SDA church. Neither Dr. Jarvis nor NCAHF has ever pretended to speak for Adventists. NCAHF is located on campus as are are other organizations served by university faculty. It is not uncommon for faculty members to use their offices for professional or community service activities. University administrators have always recognized the value and sensitivity of NCAHF's work and have been very supportive. Now that they are being placed in a defensive position by this NHF smear campaign letters from those of you who wish to acknowledge LLU's support would be. appreciated. Letters should be sent to LLU President Norman J. Woods, PhD, and a copy to Neal C. Wilson, President, General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, 6840 Eastern Avenue, Washington, D.C., 20012. MORMONS AND QUACKERY In the Jan/Feb BULLETIN BOARD we reported that NHF lobbyist Clinton Miller's \"personal religion\" apparently plays an important role in his advocacy of quackery. We cited his statement that some of his Mormon brethren tell him that he goes too far with the church's belief in \"free agency\" by pro\u00ad moting questionable health practices. We have heard from one of our Mormon NCAHF members who provides further insight into this matter. Norman Smith, MD reveals in his article \"Why are Mormons so susceptible to medical and Nutritional quackery?\" (JOURNAL OF COLLEGIUM AESCULAPIUM, Dec. 1983) that the issue of quackery has been addressed directly by the Mormon church because of the confusion resulting from the use of historical antidoctor statements used out of context. The Mormon movement developed during a time in history when medicine was practiced by competing medical cults. In addition to the heroic poison despensing doctors, Thomsonian herbalists, homeo\u00ad paths there was the strong belief that faith in God was the _bes.Ltr.eatment~ Early. Mo.rrnon 1 eaders were critical of All doctors--even the herbalists--but changed when medicine became rational and scientific toward the latter part of the 19th century. However, folk traditions are strong and despite official church endorsement, scientific medicine still is regarded suspiciously by many Mormons. Smith states, \"In the mid-1970's there was a flurry of activity publishing books and magazines\u00b7 attaching unorthodox medicine, herbalism and nutr\u00ad itional fadism to LOS theology and belief.\" The official .church responded in the Feb. 19, 1977 Church News: \"The Church deplores the patronage oT\"\"lieaTTn or medical practices which might be considered ethically or legally questionable. People with serious illnesses should consult with competent physicians licensed under the laws of the land to practice medicine.\" later that year, on June 18, Church News published an editorial entitled \"Heal'tllradsmay hurt\" in which the Church officially disclaimed all pretensions that fads could be advocated under the Word of Wisdom. Further, the editorial states that the Church \"completely disclaims any sponsorship or endor\u00ad sement of such teachers, remedies, foods, or fads\" Smith notes that many who promote irregular prac\u00ad tices in the LOS community do so sincerely. He says, \"Many feel that the right to choose even dangerous forms of quackery is part of the divine principle of free agency, and that any restrict\u00ad ; ons on the free choice is Satanic.\" This is apparently where Clinton Miller fits in. Since its impossible to win a religious dispute we will not attempt to change Miller's mind, but he might do well to recall the Biblical admonition \"by their fruits shall ye know them.\" DENVER SYMPOSIUM A GREAT SUCCESS ___ .;;..;.;.;,;.~;.;;.;..;;.-- Over 200 participants attended the NCAHF symposium held in Denver on March 14. The event was jointly sponsored by the Nutrition Section of the Colorado Public Health Association, Tri-county Health Dept, Colorado Medical Society and the FDA. A most interesting development was the presence of pickets outside proclaiming the symposium to be an attack on \"health freedom.\" The meeting was purely educational with no legislative or law enforcement activities. It is paradoxical that these self-proclaimed defenders of \"freedom\" were, in fact, there opposing the free speech of those of us who\u00b7 believe in responsible health care. A spokesperson for the picketers told a Rocky Mountain News reporter that the purpose of the conference was \"to train FDA 'snitches'.\" The presence of pickets increased interest in the conference and drew greater attention to NCAHF and its cause. Suddenly the perpetrators of health fraud became REAL, not hypothetical people. It seemed incredible to media representatives that someone would actually come out and openly defend quackery. Dr. Jim Lowell conversed with one of the picketers and found the typical confused expressions of \"health freedom\" advanced by the NHF. Lowell dubbed the picketers \"The Quackettes\" (i.e., as in \"Rockettes\") because they \"were dancing to the tune of quackery!\" If you would like to have an NCAHF symposium in your area contact Vala Jean Stults, PhD, RD, who ___________ js _it1_charge of organizing these events.

NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR CHIROPRACTIC MEDICINE AFFILIATES WITH NCAHF - The NACM is made up of chiropractors who share NCAHF's principles of consumer protection and science. NACM practitioners endorse the NCAHF Position Paper on Chiropractic. They strive to put chiropractic on a scientific basis, limiting it to neuro-musculoskeletal problems with none of the original chiropractic notions about \"subluxations\" affecting \"nerve flow\" with implications for a wide variety of visceral disorders. NACM is a force\u00b7 for reforming chiropractic into a rational, responsible health care delivery system.\u00b7 More will be written about NACM in a forthcoming issue of the NCAHF Newsletter. TASK FORCE ON NUTRITION DIPLOMA MILLS NEEDS votITNTE~ ---- When still the CCAHF, we formed a Task Force on Nutrition Diploma _Mills in California. That group has completed its work and will soon issue a report. Now that we've become national the Task Force has been reorganized and will be coordinated by Joan Vickers, MS, RD, Specialist in Dietetics, Department of Home Economics, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712-1097; telephone: (512)471-4287. Prospective volunteers should send resumes to Ms. Vickers. One thing the Task Force will be doing is gathering information from every questionable nutrition-related program that can be discovered. CANCER TASK FORCE NAME CHANGE ------------ In the last BULLETIN BOARD we announced the formation of the Task Force on Unproven Methods of Cancer Management. The word \"Questionable\" has been substituted for \"Unproven.\" This change is consistent with NCAHF's recommendation to the American Cancer Society that they do the same. We believe \"unproven\" is too vague and easily confused with experimental procedures that have not been proven or disproven. Also, some quack methods have been disproven, others are untested but implausible. We believe \"questionable\" i; more accurate because questions about the validity of diagnostic procedures and the safety and effectiveness of preventive and therapeutic procedures are what is involved. The Task Force s~ill needs volunteers. Send resume to: Ben Wilson, MD, P.O. Box 21, Dallas, OR 97338; Telephone: (503)623-8141.

ENHANCING FREEDOM OF CHOICE THROUGH RELIABLE INFORMATION MAY/JUNE 1986 STUDY FINDS RAW MILK A HAZARD TO PUBLIC HEALTH UCLA researchers engaged by Alta Dena Dairy, the nation's largest marketer of certified raw milk (CRM), to review published and unpublished literature on the safety of raw milk consumption In California have concluded that drinking CRM is hazardous and, noting the lack of legislative support for a ban, CRM should at least carry a consumer warning label stating: ''This product is unpasteurized. Although it is produced under strict industry standards, it may contain harmful bacteria or other organisms. Persons with weakened immune systems, such as those having cancer, infants and the elderly, should consult their physician before consumption of this product.\" It is recommended that the effectiveness of the warning label be evaluated at some future time. NCAHF JOINS IN CALL FOR SURVEILLANCE OF HARM DUE TO FOOD SUPPLEMENTATION ABUSES A panel of authorities on nutrition and supplementation met in Washington, D.C. on May 5 to express alarm over the growing abuse of vitamin and mineral supplements In America. . The American Dietetic Association initiated panel called upon the nation's physicians to record supplement use by patients much as they currently do with drugs. Allan Forbes, MD, stated that the FDA will begin collecting reports from the medical community through its Adverse Reactions Monitoring System. The panel consisted of ADA President Anita Owen, FDA's Allan Forbes, MD, David Heber, MD, PhD, Chief of Clinical Nutrition at UCLA, Victor Herbert, MD, JD, of the Ml Sinai Medical Center, NYC, Robert Heaney, MD or Creighton Univ., and Charles Marshall, PhD, who represented NCAHF. Dr. Marshall prepared a brief 3-page summary of the toxic effects of various vitamins and minerals that may be obtained from NCAHF. NOTE: The April, 1986 Issue of CHANGING TIMES carried an excellent article entitled 'When more is too much\" which addresses the problems of supplement abuse very well. COMMENT: We can expect a large howl from promoters since supplements are the biggest single money-makers in the -questionable nutrition marketplace. NEWSLETTER QUALITY IN THE HEAL TH MARKETPLACE NCAHF NEWSLETTER VOL9,N0.3 DID FOOD FADDISTS \"TELL US SO\" ON CANCER AND DIET? Food faddists are fond of stating \"we told you sol\" now that the American Cancer Society (ACS} and the National Academy of Sciences (NAS} have made specific dietary recommendations for the prevention of cancer. This ploy may work when used on people with a superficial knowledge of the subject, but those of us who have followed both cancer quackery and research on possible links between diet and cancer over the years are aware that such boasting is unwarranted. Which dietary practices promoted by faddists are we supposed to now credit them? Faddists have touted such a variety of practices as preventives and/or cures --faddists seldom differentiate between the two-- that something they promoted may eventually be shown to have merit even if only by chance. Practices that have been promoted by faddists include fasting, fruit diets, various forms of vegetarianism, organic foods, macrobiotics, carrot juice, the grape diet, raw organ meats, raw milk,Jertile eggs, herbs (some of which are now known to be carcinogenic), avoiding aluminum tookware, \"chemical preservatives\" (some of which are now available in health food stores as supplements!} \"processed\" foods and an almost unending list that makes little sense. Faddist have always promoted supplements, particularly megadoses of vitamins. Also keep in mind is Robach's observation that \"quackery always takes its cues from developments in the world of knowledge\". Promoting the ingestion of fiber and foods from the cabbage family, avoidance of salt-cured, naturally-smoked or charred foods, and excess fats are borrowed from research leads being followed by scientists. Doing the scientific work takes time, but jumping on the bandwagon by publishing a book or hawking products or services can be done much more quickly. Its the old ploy that \"'If you see a movement coming, get out in front and pretend to be leading ft.\" Thus some books written touting fiber 10 or 15 years ago now seem to have been near the mark, but what about the faddist books such as Yudkin's incredible statement in SWEET AND DANGEROUS that sucrose causes more cancer than tobacco; Or, Adelle Davis' claim that drinking a quart of milk a day would prevent cancer--a practice she followed and died of cancer. \u00b7 Anyone familiar with the literature on diet and cancer knows how little is certain so far as specifics are concerned. The NAS and ACS have bent over backward to come up with some specific dietary recommendations for avoiding cancer. Constructionist scientists (ie, those who adhere to the policy of only making scientific statements when evidence justifies them} are chagrined by the willingness of prestigious organizations like NAS and ACS to make recommendations based upon Incomplete, inconsistent, epidemiological data. They argue that someone should guard the conservatism of science. However, the epidem.lologlsts and health educators are more apt believe that the public should be given the \"best guess now'' even If ft is half-baked, for by the time we know for certain, ft will be too late for those of us alive today. From a health education point of view, the thinking of both groups is understandable, and it seems wise to go along with publicizing premature dietary recommendations as long as they are couched within strong disclaimers regarding the level of certainty Involved. Unfortunately, the disclaimers invariably get dropped and the messages take on \"quack-:-like\" sounds as they appear to promise more than can be delivered. The ACS dietary recommendation may be also criticized for not having included that only naturally smoked foods, not those artificially-flavored, have been linked to cancer and for deleting the recommendation AGAINST supplements. The possibility that a link between diet and cancer might exist has been theorized for years. Physiologists have noted that diet provides our bodies with the most elegant biochemical experience of our daily lives. epidemiologists have noted differing cancer rates among various peoples of the world and have suggested diet as one of the more likely &9asons for this. As the search for truth in the possible diet/cancer link goes on, science will do the work and quacks will grab as much of the credit as possible. Its frustrating but that's the nature of quackery. Responsible educators must keep the public informed so they don't make the error of believing the boastful quacks who would claim to have been ahead of science today in the same manner as Galileo was in his day.

The Psychiatry Controls Committee of the hospital said that the treatments Brandt proposed should not be used except In cases of patients with a diagnosed deficiency or on an experimental basis. Brandt contended that the treatments were not experimental. The court's ruling was that she may not use the facilities to administer treatments except In accordance with conditions prescribed by the governing body of the institution.

BHT SUPPLEMENTATION TOXICITY REPORTED Physicians Deborah Shllan and Judi Goldstone of the UCLA Student Health Service report In the March 6, 1986 (314:648) the case of a 22- year-old woman who was following the advice proffered In the popular book THE LIFE EXTENSION COMPANION by Pearson and Shaw that BHT is useful In the treatment of genital herpes. The book recommends maintenance doses of at least 2 grams per day taken at bedtime on an empty stomach. BHT Is available In 250 mg doses at health food stores. The subject took 4 grams before bed on an empty stomach and later that evening experienced severe cramping, weakness, nausea and vomiting. On the next day she was taken to the emergency room and released with a diagnosis of gastroenteritis. The next day she experienced dizziness, more vomiting and lost consciousness and was admitted to the hospital. The authors warn tflat many students may be follewing the advice of Pearson and Shaw and Ingesting toxic amounts of BHT. THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR CHIROPRACTIC MEDICINE One of NCAHPs newest affiliates in the National Association for Chiropractic Medicine (NACM). NACM Is committed to bffiigmglmlropractlc into the scientific health care community. NACM does not accept D.D. Palmer's concepts of \"subluxatlons,\" \"Innate,\" \"misalignments,\" \"fixations,\" \"restoration of nerve energy\" or other supposed spinal problems as a major cause of disease. NACM members restrict their scope of practice to neuromusculoskeletal conditions -\u00ad particularly functional back disorders -- and although they emphasize joint manipulation therapy they wish to Include other scientifically valid modalities as well. NACM practitioners seek to work closely with other licensed, scientifically oriented health professionals for the best interest of patients. NACM's code of ethics excludes unnecessary or excessive treatment, questionable advertising, and unscrupulous practice management schemes. Many associated with NACM provided Important input for NCAHPs Position Paper on Chiropractic. There is a high demand for the kind of care scientifically oriented chiropractors can provide. NACM offers the best hope we've seen for reforming chiropractic Into a useful part on the health care system. WOMAN WINS $1 MIUION FOR LOSS OF \"PSYCHIC POWERS\" FOUOWING CAT SCAN A 42-year-old New Castle, Delaware woman has been awarded more than $1 million by a jury after she claimed that she was unable to continue to earn a living as a psychic. Judith Richardson Halmes claims that she was previously able to read people's auras, conduct seances, observe the past and help police solve crimes, but that a 1976 CAT scan left her with severe headaches preventing her from concentrating enough to utilize her psychic abilities. The judge reportedly ordered the jury to disregard Haimes' allegations about her lost psychic powers and consider only her testimony about allergic reaction from a dye used during the CAT scan procedure. The size of the award makes It apparent that the jury did not listen to the judge. The case is being appealed. (LOS ANGELES TIMES, March 29, 1986, Part I, p.3). COMMENT: This comes under NCAHF's heading of \"harm to society\" caused by health fraud, misinformation or quackery. NCAHF contends that when substantial numbers of the population believe nonsense I.t can have far reaching effects that include the courtroom. Despite years of research psychic powers have not been demonstrated to exist In anyone, let alone the specific plaintiff In the foregoing case. However, Irresponsible treatment of the topic of extrasensory perception and other allegedly paranormal abilities by the media has reinforced the myth of psychic powers and can be linked to such jury actions. It may be less damaging when sitcoms portray witchcraft (eg, I Dream of Jeanlej or other fantasized paranormal powers, but when pseudodocumentaries such as \"In Search or are presented In such a manner as to confuse science with speculation the effects can be serious. Network officials have been confronted with this problem and their reply has been that paranormal topics are treated as entertainment rather than news. In other words, they don't take these notions seriously themselves, so they don't treat them as serious topics. Cynics say that topics like UFOs, Bigfoot, the Bermuda Triangle, and ESP sell too well to encourage an effort to demythologize such nonsense. Whatever the reasons, the result Is a population steeped In superstition. This has ominous implicatlons for a democratic society confronting decisions requiring a higher level of scientific understanding than has ever before been required of human beings. Hopefully, one of these days media leaders will begin to address this malevolent condition of society. NUTRITION FORUM EDITOR ASSAILS TALK SHOWS FOR SPREADING NUTRITION MISINFORMATION Dr. Stephen Barrett criticizes television talk shows for routinely promoting quackery or suspect health advice according to a LOS ANGELES TIMES article by Daniel Puzo (March 20, 1986). Barrett was particularly critical of the Phil Donahue show and speciflcally cites the sale of 30,000 copies of \"Dr Berger's Immune Power Dief' in the three days following the author's appearance on Donahue. Quotes attributed to a spokesperson for the Donahue Show makes It clear that they have an anything goes and let the listener beware philosophy. CHIROPRACTIC - THE CLINICAL ART An analysis of the successfulness of chiropractic as a clinical art Is discussed In a comprehensive and fair assessment provided by John Coulehan, In the Department of Medicine and Community Medicine, University of Pittsburg. In \"Chiropractic and the clinical art,\" (SOC. SCI. MED, 21:383-390, 1985) Coulehan presents insights Into chiropractors and their patients. It may be revealing to some that 56\"/4 of chiropractic patients had already sought medical help, and 85% had a family physician with whom they were satisfied. Most patients seek chiropractic aid for musculoskeletal problems and apparently only a small number subscribe to the notion of preventive spinal care promoted so vigorously by true believing DCs. Coulehan discusses the relative successfulness of various approaches to relieving back pain. Clinical success is attributed partially to mechanisms not unlike faith healing. The quality of \"genuineness\" is grounded in the faith in what he/she does to help people and the ability to \"nourish the patient's own faith in becoming well.\" Interestingly, Coulehan notes that chiropractic appeals BOTH to mechanistic and holistic aspects of our culture with the subluxatlon concept by providing a mechanistic explanation for a spiritualistic process {ie, the Improvement of \"nerve flow\" or \"Life Force\" brought about by the removal of subluxations.) REVICI CASE REMANDED: POLITICS OR DUE PROCESS? New york physician, Emanuel Revlci, 89, has been associated with .questionable cancer treatment for many years. In a hearing conducted between Jan. 4, 1984 and May 15, 1985, the five-member committee of the State Board for Professional Medical Conduct found Revici guilty of 10 of 12 specifications and recommended revocation of Revici's medical license. However, the New York State Board of Regents, for the first time in their history, did not follow the commission's recommendation but remanded the case back to them for a new hearing. The Regents claim that Revlcl was denied due process, but critics say that political pressure by Revlcl's supporters Is the more likely reason for this unprecedented action. THE FISH STORY FROM CONSUMER'S UNION There has been much ado about the benefits of fish in the diet recently that Is being capitalized upon by supplement promoters In the form of fish oil capsules. The June issue of CONSUMER REPORTS (51 :388-370) reviews the story of fish and Its apparent protective effects against coronary heart disease. Showing good balance, the CU article also presents the negative side of fish consumption including Its possible connection with cerebral hemorrhage, allergic reactions, environmental contamination, and problems associated with eating raw fish (eg, sushi or sashlmi). On the topic of fish oil capsules, CU states that \"Fish oil Is admittedly more than just snake oil with gills.\" After pointing to the possible beneficial effects of fish oil and noting that research on fish oil is still at an early stage, CU notes, \"There's no proof as yet that taking capsule of two a day will do anything more than grease your intestines. Pending further clinical trials, most researchers in this field advise eating fish instead.\" NCAHF would add, \"in moderation!\" 3 \\ ' LINUS PAULING'S NEW BOOK Linus Pauling's new book, HOW TO LIVE LONGER AND FEEL BETTER, {W.H. FREEMAN COMPANY, 1988) extols overdoses of vitamin C in typical Pauling fashion, but now adds others such as vitamins A and B12. The book has been launched with a \"$75,000 promotion budget and author tour,\" and promises to be a best seller. Two reviewers of Pauling's book have treated It disdainfully. Thomas H. Jukes, PhD, {WASHINGTON POST, April 30) questions Pauling's recommendations for 40,000 units of vitamin A daily, and points out that those given for B12 are thousands of times the RDA. In addition, Pauling apparently confuses milligrams with micrograms when he calls for 1,000 milligrams of B12 for \"every retarded child.\" Jukes also finds Pauling very much in error about his understanding of the Kreb Cycle. Pauling asserts that fructose in harmful and that It is processed differently than glucose \"such that It produces acetate, which ls a precursor of cholesterol.\" Actually, glucose, fructose and several other food substances produce acetate most of which is metabolized to carbon dioxide and water. notes Jukes. Pauling reruns the discredited claims of John Yudkln In the book, SWEET AND DANGEROUS, claiming that sugar Is a major cause of heart disease. Pauling also attacks the Mayo Clinic's study which failed to show any benefit of vitamin C for cancer patients. Pauling states that they have \"deliberately misrepresented their investigation\" In a ''fraudulent paper.\" Pauling also defends \"orthomolecular medicine,\" a term he himself invented, and Michael Gerber, MD, the former President of the Orthomolecular Medical Association who lost his California medical license in 1984 following the probably needless death of a cancer patient given 99 different orthomolecular remedies including buttermilk enemas, red clover tea, mudbaths, wheat germ juice, garlic clove per rectum and \"candle meditation, beeswax only.\" Dr. Jukes adds in correspondence with NCAHF that Pauling extols chelation therapy for heart disease using recently convicted Bruce Halstead, MD, as his authority. Michael Nelson reviews Pauling's book in the Aprll Issue of NATURE {320:641). Nelson states that Pauling uses \"uncompeling arguments to try and convince readers of the benefits of the megavltamin treatment of life.\" Nelson says the the book \"contains a number of irritating nutritional inaccuracies,\" and speaks of ~absurd\" suggestions that stand \"nutrition on Its head.\" \"For illness after illness, from the common cold to AIDS, Dr. Pauling presents repetitive and wholly one-sided arguments In favor of treatment with massive doses of vitamin c, states Nelson. \"This lack of balance lends an evangelical tone to his writing and casts justifiable doubt on his interpretation of others findings.\" ./ HVPERBARIC OXYGEN FAILS AGAIN JN MS TRIAL ' We have reported previously that hyperbaric oxygen therapy {HBO) has failed to benefit multiple sclerosis {MS) patients in controlled studies (NCAHF NEWSLETTER, August, 1985, p.3).

NCAHF IMITATED BUT NOT FLATTERED Imitation is said to be the most sincere form of flattery, but NCAHF Is not flattered by something calling Itself the National Association Against Health Fraud (NAAHF) in . Denver which promotes questionable health practices In the name of consumerism. NAAHF also Is using a slightly modified reproduction of NCAHF's copyrighted Quackbuster Duck logo. NAAHF is headed by a Nebraskan named Jeff Harsh who picketed NCAHF's March 14 symposium in Denver charging that our purpose was \"to train snitches for the FDA.\" Harsh also picketed Denver's Channel 9 Health Fair because of its policy of not allowing nonscientific \"alternative\" practitioners to participate. Of special interest to us is Harsh's boast to Channel 9 that he has the list of all those who attended our Denver symposium. This is curious because the list disappeared along with a box of materials belonging to one of the symposium organizers.

THE NATIONAL COUNCIL CHAPTERS GLUCOMANNAN CAUSES ESOPHAGEAL OBSTRUCTION Glucomannan, a highly touted ingredient in a number of fraudulent weight loss products, swells to a viscous gel upon contact with water.

Seven cases have been reported where the glucomannan tablets swelled while in the esophagus causing obstruction. See Henry D., et al., BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL, 292:591-2, 1986.

Woods, PhD, on behalf of his volunteer work with NCAHF. Dr. Woods has personally expressed his deep appreciation for NCAHF's efforts on behalf of consumers and wishes to see its work continue on the LLU campus. Your letters will provide him with some tangible evidence to present to others that NCAHF's work is sound and has broad support within the community. Others within the Seventh\u00ad day Adventist organization have also stood behind NCAHF's presence at LLU. We have been told that SDA church president Neal C. Wilson has received around 400 of Clinton Miller's form letters. In addition, SDA laymen who share the National Health Federation's \"buyer beware\" philosophy have published libelous documents of there own combining the distortions done by Miller with those published by Valentine in THE SPOTLIGHT. These are also being sent to other key church and medical leaders. A sample of the kind of irrationality Miller's distortions have engendered can been seen in a newletter published by an SDA extremist in Tennessee. He writes: \"There is the very rea 1 possibility that erelong, our people will be so frightened by Dr. Jarvis' police state views, -\u00ad that few Adventists would dare to speak to the neighbor or fellow church members about healthful living for fear of legal action, court trials, fines and threatened imprisonment.\" As absurd as this suggestion is there are many who will believe it, spread it to qtl'ler~ an<:! add to the destruction of Dr. Jarvis' and NCAHFs' reputations. We do not wish to belabor this matter or give it an undue space in the limited amount we have available to communicate with NCAHF members, especially when it involves Dr. Jarvis personally and his church. If any of you desire more information, you can write to NCAHF and request copies of Miller's article and Dr. Jarvis' rebuttal. Those of you who would like to write a letter of support, send your letters to Norman J. Woods, PhD President, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA '92350; Also, send a copy to Neal C.

TASK FORCE ON BROADCAST MEDIA ABUSE ------ ---- We are all aware that a major source for the dissemination of health misinformation and the promotion of questionable health books, products and services is the broadcast media (ie, radio and television). Fewer of us realize how promoters manage to exploit these media for their purposes, and what can be done to curtail such abuses. NCAHF has worked on this problem for some time and has made some headway, but it is clear that a more concerted effort is needed to bring about actions against broadcast media abuse and teach our members how to deal with this problem in their local areas.

FOOD ALLERGY HYPE WARNED AGAINST. The June, 1986, FDA Consumer provides a very good article \"Food allergies: separating fact from 'hype'.\" After reviewing some of the recent pseudoscience regarding alleged food allergies Including theorized but unsubstantiated links between diet and criminal behavior and the late Dr. feingold's beliefs, the article describes the realities of food allergies and presents some of the scientific leads that are being pursued. Interestingly, 30\"/4 of women responding to a Good Housekeeping magazine survey believed they or a member of their family was allergic to a food or food ingredient! Dr. Jordan Fink, chief allergist at the Medical College of Wisconsin says the actual incidence of true food allergy Is around 2% of the populatlQn. This says something about the psychodynamics of food behavior we \u00b7need to understand. JEFFERY BLAND, PHO, HEAL TH FOODS SUPER SALESMAN. Odom Fanning provides a profile of the health foods industry's \"most prolific publicist and interpreter of nutrition-related scientific developments,\" Jeffery Bland, PhD. Unlike many of the health food hucksters, Bland's doctorate is real--a chemistry degree from the Ul)lversity of Oregon. In addition to appearing frequently. at trade shows, Bland writes and edits books, edits and publishes the magazine Complementary Medicine, produces aud~ and video tapes, condu9ts courses for professionals and serves as a consultant to several organizations which share the health food industry\"s views. Fanning reveals Bland's methods for teaching health food store clerks how to avoid \"overtly prescribing\" to clients and other devious ways to practice the health foods trade. Fanning\"s article \" \"Training' for health food retailers\" appeared In the May, 1986, Nutrition Forum, 3:33-38). NEWSLETTER QUALITY IN THE HEAL TH MARKETPLACE NCAHF NEWSLETTER VOL 9 NO 4 HEALTH CLAIMS FOR FOODS: NO NEW LAW NEEDEDI Ever since Kellogg's and the National Cancer Institute collaborated on a health message touting bran cereal fiber as a possible preventive measure against colon cancer the issue of whether or not food companies should be permitted to make health claims in their advertising and labeling has been a matter of debate. Several food industry groups are pushing hard for a new law permitting health claims In adv8,!11slng. Their best argument is that In order for the public to become aware of the possible benefits of specific dietary habits, food companies should promote these in their advertising much in the same manner as tooth paste companies have made the public aware of the benefits of fluorides against tooth decay. The idea of spending a portion of the food advertising dollar on spreading reliable nutrition Information has merit In the opinion of NCAHF President William Jarvis, the root problem of food quackery lies in the fact that nutrition misinformation is so widespread within society. Jarvis told members, of the Nutrition Foundation In 1983 that the problem of nutrition misinformation was so pervasive that only a cooperative effort involving nutrition educators and the food industry would probably succeed in salvaging nutrition science for the public. At that time, he recommended that a portion of the food Industry's advertising budget be committed to public health education about basic nutrition. Yet, in the November / December NCAHF Newsletter he expressed NCAHPs strong opposition to HR 2583, the so-called \"Foods are not drugs\" bill, which sought to liberalize the law on making health claims for foods. The questions are, whether it Is possible for the food Industry to serve the public welfare with reliable nutrition education via its advertising, and If a new law would be needed for it to do so. Victor Herbert, MD, JD, supplied the answers In a presentation before the National Food Processors Association's Conference on Food Labeling and Advertising II, held In Washington, D.C. April 28-29. Dr. Herbert quoted Section 101.9 of the consumer protecting food regulations of th~ FDA: \"a food shall be misbranded if its labeling represents, suggests, or Implies that the food, because of the presence or absence of certain dietary properties, is adequate or effective in the prevention, cure, mitigation, or treatment of any disease or symptom.\" Herbert stated that repeal of this consumer protection law will not Increase by one shred giving Americans more facts on diet and health. What it would do is open the flood gates for information of no merit designed to produce a desire for particular products. Herbert astutely pointed out to the food processors that the current law does not prohibit presenting truthful nutritional health messages In advertising or on labels. For instance, Kellogg and NCI could have easily given a responsible message, to wit: \"The National Cancer Institute suggests Americans should eat not less than 20 and not more than 35 grams of a variety of fibers from an assortment of grains. fruits and vegetables. One portion of Kellogg's AH-Bran contains 9 grams of one form of fiber: wheat bran fiber.\" Such a message, Herbert pointed out, would not have violated the law they now want to change! Herbert states, \"the food Industry can honestly message good nutrition to the public, without misleading particularization to their own product line, as General Foods did with Its national campaign promoting the seven U.S. dietary guldelines ... We need more of this type of public service promotion of sound nutrition from Industry. Industry needs no weakening of FDA consumer protection laws to provide relevant public service nutrition advice.\" Herbert has presented the message clearly. There is no conflict between sound consumer protection laws and truthful advertising or labeling. On May 22, Dr. Herbert submitted a citizen petition against allowing disease-related messages on specific foods and food supplements to FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young, MD, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. You may wish to support Dr. Herbert's petition with a letter to the attention of Curtis D. Noah, in FDA's Division of Compliance Policy.

CALIFORNIA PHYSICIAN SENTENCED FOR FRAUD. Bruce Halstead, the California physician convicted of 24 counts of cancer fraud and grand theft on October 3, 1985, for selling ADS, a potion that was 99.4% water, lost his chance for leniency when Superior Court Judge Marvin D. Rowen decided that he had not made a vigorous effort to sell his clinic and was continuing to portray himself as a victim of a medical conspiracy. The judge imposed the original four-year sentence instead of reducing it to 18 months as he said he would if Halstead would relinquish his medical license, sell or close his clinic, drop all medical activities and give up the title of \"doctor.\" Instead, Halstead has been actively attempting to hire a \"holistic health physician\" through the Townsend Letter. The judge also expressed dismay about Halstead's \"continuing and unhappy attitude\" as conveyed in . the current issue of Freedom magazine published by the Church of Scientology entitled, \"Respected M.D. Targeted by Medical Gestapo.\" (LOS ANGELES TIMES, June-2s,-191r5, \u00a5art I, p.27).~ -----~----- BOOK MAY BE CAUSE OF IATROGENIC ILLNESS. The book The Yeast Connection may be responsible for producing illness in some people according to an account in JAMA (255:3250). Ors. Quinn and Venezio report four cases of iatrogenic illness resulting from inappropriate antifungal therapy. One patient had developed symptomatic hepatitis temporally associated with ketoconazole therapy. All of the patients were women who had not only read the book but carried a copy with them into the office. All believed themselves to be suffering from candldiasis, and were taking either nystatln or ketoconazole prescribe by family physicians. BRITISH REPORT CONDEMNS \"ALTERNATIVE\" MEDICINE. When Prince Charles was the President of the British Medical Association (BMA), he asked the Association to look critically at modern medicine. The study took \u00b7 three years to complete and -----c1ea1t-w1ur -abour---roo--treatments;- The-report condemns \"alternative\" medicine as ineffective and sometimes dangerous. According to a newspaper account in the Melbourne, Australia. &rn, (May 14, 1986) although the BMA report is attacked by two proponent organizations, neither would provide evidence against it. NCAHF has not yet seen the full report; a request has been sent to the BMA for a copy. NUTRITION BOOK WRITTEN WITH WIT AND ACCURACY. Helen Bishop MacDonald, RD of Calgary, Alberta has shown that sound nutrition writing doesn't have to be dull. Her 1985 book Eating For The Health Of It, (Austin Books, Box 4, Site 10, R.R.#1, Priddis, Alberta, Canada, T0L 1W0) covers basic nutrition, fads and fallacies, nutrition and the life cycle, lifestyle and lots more. This is the kind of book you can buy for your friends who are interested in nutrition and 11eetl some--guidance but wouldp't read a stodgy scientific nutrition book. HERBALIFE SETTLES OUT OF COURT IN DEATH SUIT. Herbalife International recenuy setUed a wrongful death suit out of court that was brought by the widow of 35 year-old former NFL football player Bivian Lee in New Orleans. The amount will not be disclosed as part of the agreement The suit claimed that Herbalife was responsible for Mr. Lee's death. It is interesting that it was not the use of Herbalife products per se that was claimed to have caused Lee's death, (NOTE: this is consistent with an FDA statement that none of the five deaths associated with Herbalife have been linked directly to use of the products themselves) but that it was the misinformation supplied by a company representative that caused Lee to ignore adverse symptoms that would have normally caused him to seek medical care in time for effective help.\" Lee dll)d of cardiomyopathy, a degenerative disease of uncertain causes. The story is that Lee had decided to become an Herbalife salesman and had been instructed thatinoraerto ~etrective he should becolne\"71 user of the products. Information supplied by a . local Herbalife supervisor contained a lengthy treatise by a, chiropractor-naturopath named Stanley Bass. Under the heading 'What symptoms to expect when you improve your diet'' Bass provided the usual naturopathlc line about how toxic wastes accumulate in the body from eating '1rrltating food preservatives, aspirins, sleeping pills, and drugs ... \" Readers were admonished that adverse symptoms such as headaches, ''fevers and/or colds ... ; the skin may break out; ... bowel sluggishness, occasional diarrhea, feelings of tiredness and weakness, disinclination to exercise nervousness, irritability, negativity or mental depression, frequent urination, etc., etc.\" were to be welcomed as signs that the cleansing process was working. Bass stated that the worse one's symptoms were the better because it was an sign that one was avoiding even more serious diseases in the future had the cleansing process not occurred. \u00b7 Mr. Lee persevered continuing using Herbalife products despite extremely adverse symptoms. Lee eventually went off the Herbalife products and when his condition deteriorated further, he made an appointment to see a physiclan--an appointment he was unable to fulfill dying un~JLectfil!!Y at 4 AM__on the da1 _he was to have seen the doctor. While the Herbalife products weren't viewed as the primary cause of Lee's death, at least one medical opinion is that the high caffeine content of the raw gaurana may have exacerbated his cardiac condition; but the main charge by the plaintiff was that the misinformation caused Mr. Lee not to seek health care in time when it is reasonable to assume he would have otherwise. NCAHF's William Jarvis, PhD, and John Renner, MD served as consultants on the case. READERS: IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO LOCATE ARTICLES CITED IN THE NEWSLETTER, NCAHF WILL SUPPLY FREE' COPIES FOR YOU.

The use of questionable cancer therapies down under appears to be substantially greater than in the United States. Cassileth found that 13% of cancer patients used such methods and a Texas study found 9% of pediatric patients using questionable therapies. In the Australian study involving 202 patients in a large cancer center 27% utilized unproven forms of cancer treatment lacking any evidence of value Feigen and Tivar, ''The impact of alternative medicine on cancer patients,\" Cancer Forum, 10:15-19, 1986). RECOMMENDATIONS OF TASK FORCE ON NUTRITION DIPLOMA MILLS IN CALIFORNIA ACCEPTED. The NCAHF Board of Directors voted to accept the report of the Task Force on Nutrition Diploma Mills in California at its June 25 meeting. The report was more than two years in th-a-making and so1ne--of 1ts-prep11rers-were-- \u00b7 involved in advising on legislative reforms that have been enacted during the interim. The report notes that while these reforms may help solve part of the problem they will fall short of what is needed nationally. Four recommendations are made; these are that: All states should enact laws (1) that assure that degree granting Institutions within their borders award degrees based on sound educational standards. In academic fields the NCAHF believes the accrediting organizations recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education should establish those standards. (2) to prohibit individuals with academic degrees obtained from unaccredited institutions from using these degrees to misrepresent themselves to the public as nutrition experts. (3) that would specifically prohibit the use of diploma mlll degrees in the mass media. (4) that prohibit unqualified individuals (with or without spurious credentials) from doing nutrition counsellng. The complete seven-page report may be ordered from NCAHF.

In the March/April NCAHF Newsletter we reported that the National Health Federation (NHF) was so concerned about the passage of effective antiquackery legislation that they mortgaged their headquarters building to raise money for the lobbying effort We have received a letter dated May 23, 1986 from NHF Operations Manager Hal Card stating: \"I have held the position of Operations Manager of the National Health Federation since 1982 and the NHF has not, nor attempted to, mortgage the headquarters building. I would appreciate a printed correction ... \" We send Mr. Card a xerox copy of page 4 of the April, 1985 Health Freedom News, containing the word for word quote of NHF President Maureen Salaman stating that NHF had mortgaged their headquarters building in Monrovia, California, which Is where Mr. Card is located. We are puzzled by this and asked Mr. Card if NHF had lied to its membership on this matter and wondering that H they did was it a tactic used to pull money from the NHF membership for use in lobbying? AHA HITS CHELATION THERAPY IN LATEST HAAS BOOK RATED POORLY. PAMPHLET The American Heart Association (AHA) has issued a 12-page pamphlet entitled \"Questions and Answers About Chelation Therapy\" which discredits chelation therapy as a treatment for heart disease. The pamphlet Includes the AHA's official position statement: '1'he American Heart Association's Task Force on New and Unestablished Therapies has reviewed the available literature on the use of chelation (EDTA) In the treatment of atherosclerotlc heart disease and finds no scientific evidence to demonstrate any benefit of this form of therapy. The Task Force recognizes that there have been no adequate trials utilizing currently approved scientific methodology to support this therapy. Furthermore, employment of this form of unproven treatment may deprive patients of the well-established benefits attendant to the many other valuable methods of treating these diseases.\" The pamphlet is available from AHA National Center, 7320 Greenville Avenue, Dallas, TX75231. FAKER UNMASKED IN DIRTY TRICKS ATTEMPT AGAINST NCAHF AFFILIATE. We reported in the November/December, 1985 NCAHF Newsletter (p.1) that a P. Joseph Lisa had written a highly speculative and inaccurate account of what he fantasizes to be a grand conspiracy against the \"holistic healing arts.\" Lisa's diatribe was eventually published in Freedom, a publication of the Church of Scientology. Lisa recently surfaced In a bizarre encounter with John Renner, MD, President of NCAHF's Kansas City affiliate. Introducing himself as Mr. \u00b7 Michael (Mark) Schaffer, Lisa presented Dr. Renner with a letter of introduction from a company called lnfocon, Information Consultants Association, of New York. The letter stated that that firm had been contracted to research and assemble data, documentation, court records and the like on the subject of quackery and health fraud. It claimed that its clients were a group of private attorneys. For some reason, Dr. Renner became suspicious and asked for Identification which was refused. Renner then called the police and with their help determined from his driver's license that \"Mark Schaffer\" was actually Peter Joseph Lisa who Is believed to be a member or agent of the Church of Scientology. Lisa appears to be some kind of a comic opera figure running around trying to build a case for his conspiracy notions. AIDS PATIENTS AND QUACKERY. Medical World News reported in It April 28, 1986 issue that AIDS patients were turning to unproven therapies In their desperation for effective therapy. Among the popular therapies identified were antiviral drugs purchased In Mexico, macrobiotic diets, vitamin C In massive doses, \"detoxification\" therapy using ionized water and combinations of so-called \"holistic health\" remedies. The article provides the optimistic reports of proponents and a small bit of reality from Dr. D. Peter Drotrnan, a medical epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control's AIDS program. Drotrnan notes that the evidence is weak and not reproducible and advises AIDS patients to enroll In controlled trials. Eat to Succeed, by \"Dr.\" Robert Haas has been judged \"not recommended\" by Lisa Harris In the May/June, 1986, Current Diet Review (1 :2). Although Haas is said to provide some good information and advice Is his book such as increased complex carbohydrates, low fat and animal proteins, exercise in weight-loss programs, using fish oils, discouraging the use of appetite suppressants, etc., none of these are unique to his book. Haas Is criticized for his dependence upon food supplements and promoting his Twinsport product line. Haas has an extensive bibliography but follows the inappropriate practice of not referencing his citations in the text making verficatlon next to Impossible. Current Diet Review is a bimonthly publication that does thorough reviews of contemporary nutrition books. Reviewers follow a prescribed format that first describes\u00b7 the book; next the dietary plans recommended in the books are evaluated according the both the four-food group model and a computerized dietary analysis; then the pros and cons are discussed followed by a presentation of the author's credentials and the reviewer's recommendations. This, procedttre is followed on all books and assures a balanced and subtantlve review. This bimonthly publication Is available from 23441 Golden Springs, Suite 299, Diamond Bar, CA 91765 for $18 per year. NOTE: In case readers need more Information on the inadequacy of Dr. Berger's Immune Power Diet, it was also reviewed In the May/June issue and not recommended. ACS REVIEWS THE UNPROVEN CANCER TREATMENT METHODS Of HAROLD MANNER. The American Cancer Society reviews the theories, claims and therapeutic regimen of Harold Manner's ''Metabolic Cancer Therapy\" In the May/June issue of CA-A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, (36:185-189). The Manner therapy is largely a leatrile-centered program similar to those offered by other laetrile proponents. Manner brought attention to himself by claiming major tumor regression in mice with laetrile, vitamin A and enzymes. Manner had primarily injected a proteolytic enzyme directly into the tumor simply digesting It. Such a procedure would not only not result in a cure but has the potential for lethal anaphylactlc shock if administered repeatedly to humans. The evaluation presents evidence of both the lack of safety and Ineffectiveness of the Metabolic Cancer Therapy regimen. STUDY REVEALS NUTRITIONAL PRACTICES AMONG CHIROPRACTORS. A study of the yellow pages advertising by a Loma Linda University Public Health Science student provides some information on the extent of the advertising of nutrition services and questionable methods of nutritional assessment by chiropractors in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. A total of 1,115 chiropractic ads or individual listings were analyzed. 78, or seven percent of the practitioners listed nutritional services. 23 (29%) of these made mention of invalid methods such as hair analysis, applied kinesiology, \"allergy testing\" or questionable practices such as herbalism. 3 STATE HOPPING BY UNFIT PHYSICIANS BECOMING MORE DIFFICULT. According to Bryant L Galusha, MD, Vice President of the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB), stronger laws for mandantory reporting of disciplinary actions and a computerized data bank are making it \"next to impossible\" for sanctioned physicians to continue practice by hopping from state to state. FSMB President, William E. Jacott, MD, also expressed concern over a large and growing pool of \"unlicensed and unlicensable people\" (Medical World News, June 9, 1986, p.73). COMMENT: This is a welcomed development. NCAHF has become increasingly aware that a substantial number of the MDs involved in nonscientific practices have sordid histories as irregular practitioners in some previous place. SAFETY OF HOMEOPATHIC REMEDY QUESTIONED. It is generally believed that homeopathic remedies are directly harmless because of their highly diluted formulas. Ronald Mack, MD, writing in the October, 1985, North Carolina Medical Journal (46:518-519), is not so sure when It comes to advice provided in the March, 1985 issue of American Homeopathy (2:3). An article on treating tonsillitis recommends \"a dose or two of Aconite ... \" Dr. Mack states that Aconite is \"an excellent poison\" known to the ancient Greeks and is what was used as poison In Hamlet. Aconite is better known today as Monkshood but is also AKA Friar's Cap, Helmet Flower, Soldier's Cap and Wolfbane. The alkaloids are alleged to be so toxic that merely picking the flowers can cause prickling or numbness of the fingers. Aconitine has been used experimentally to disrupt the normal heartbeat so that new drugs that affect the heart can be evaluated. The lethal dose in approximately 5 mg of the alkaloid, a very easily dose to get if working directly with the plants themselves. FDA WARNS AGAINST AROMA THERAPY PRODUCTS Aroma therapy is another one of those combinations of a throwback to the presclentific era, capitalization upon common experience and quasi-scientific reasoning now being touted by so-called \"holistic practitioners.\" The ancient miasmic theory of disease causation held that illnesses were caused by foul odors emanating from the earth, swamps, etc. Malaria traces its name to \"mal air\" (ie, bad air). Pleasant odors such as the fragrance of a rose lift our spirits and nice perfumes delight our senses. Bad breath and body odors have been claimed by psychologists to be defense mechanisms of anti-social people to keep others at a distance. A number of new aroma products are being introduced with claims or implications that their use will improve personal well-being in a variety of ways such as \"strengthening the body's self\u00ad defense mechanisms,\" \"for treatment of prevention of allergies,\" and so forth. In an April 23 TALK PAPER the FDA warns that \"articles Intended for the diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of disease and intended to affect the structure or any function of the body, usually are considered to be drugs --with all 'new drugs' requiring FDA's market approval.\" ADULTERATED HOMEOPATHIC REMEDY. Morice reports on a case of severe asthma which responded strikingly to a homeopathic medication manufactured in Pakistan. The homeopathic treatment known as \"Dumcap\" was labeled as containing \"nux stramonlum, an anticholinergic agent, could be expected to have an effect. upon asthma, so adulteration was suspected. Analysis revealed approximately 4 mg per capsule of prednlsolone and an unknown quantity of betamethasone that were no doubt responsible for the clinical improvement of the patient C'Adulterated 'Homoeopathic' cure for asthma, The Lancet, April '12, '1986,.pp.862-863). irrational to expect Infinitesimal homeopathic doses to have any more than a placebo effect Before accepting any significant effects of such remedies the possibility of adulteration must be ruled out Such a requirement Is no different than for any experimental drug. CHIROPRACTORS SUIT FOR HOSPITAL PRIVILEGES THROWN OUT BY COLORADO JUDGE. A federal judge threw a $20 million lawsuit brought by chiropractors out of court calling It baseless and frivilous. Chief U.S. District Judge Sherman G. Finesllver was miffed because the Colorado Chiropractic Council and numerous Individual chiropractors had filed the lawsuit without even having applied for hospital privileges from the Institutions they wished to sue for not granting such privileges. Finesilver questioned the motives for the suit noting that It had the earmarks of coercion and Intimidation. At least one Colorado hospital reached an out\u00ad of-court settlement and .now extends hospital privileges to chiropractors. (From the Rocky Mountain News, July 8, '1986, p.96) LACK OF ASSOCIATION BETWEEN FLUORIDATION AND CANCER. COMMENT: This report serves as a warning to anyone impressed by the seemingly effective performance of a homeopathic remedy. It is Guy Newell, MD of the Dept of Cancer Prevention at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Hospital and Milton Marshall, PhD, Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research provide a brief but substantive review of the data on cancer and fluoridation including reference to the \"seriously flawed\" studies by Yiamouyannls and Burk (\"lack of association between fluoridation of water and cancer,\" Texas Medicine, 82:48-50, February, '1986).

Most notable is the relocation of the NCAHF Resource Center to Kansas City where a larger staff and greater resources will improve NCAHF's ability to serve members, the media_ and the public. Membership inquiries and information about current status, and so forth can now be made directly to the AAA Computer Mailing Service that maintains the NCAHF membership list. This should improve efficiency and eliminate errors that sometimes occur with added handling. William Jarvis will take charge of coordinating chapters and divisions. He will continue to edit the Newslette~ and answer the main NCAHF telephone 1 i ne. Please consult the box on the mailing page of the Newsletter for additional information. These changes are effective immediately. QUACKBUSTER POSTER AN EYE-CATCHER! By now you should have seen the flyer advertising NCAHF' s new quack buster duck poster. Its forest green background and bright ye 11 ow \"QUACKBUSTER\" wording, which is the same color as Quacky's face, jump right out to catch attention and create awareness about quackery. Dollar signs add to the message as Quacky appears as a generic snake oil salesman. NCAHF' s slogan \"Enhancing freedom of choice through reliable information\" says much to discredit the main message of organized quackery which attempts to make the peddling of question\u00ad able a freedom of choice issue. We hope members will spread the word about NCAHF by displaying these all over the nation. AVOIDING LEGAL PROBLEMS The NCAHF Board of Directors approved a document that has been under development for more than two years on how to avoid legal problems while confronting the proponents of health fraud, misin\u00ad formation and quackery. The document was written by NCAHF President Jarvis with the aid of six or more attorneys who are members of NCAHF. The document is not intended as legal advice but as a educational device to make members more aware of the way laws work. You can otain a copy by sending $1 and a stamped, self-addressed, business sized envelope to the NCAHF Resource Center in Kansas City.

NCAHF TASK FORCE ON CONSUMER ACTIVISM REPORT Wallace Sampson, MD, Coordinator of the NCAHF Task Force on Consumer Activism presented an action plan to aid local groups in their efforts against health fraud, misinformation and quackery. The report is a revision of a plan Dr. Sampson helped develop in connection with the California Medical Association's Committee on Health Education of the Public. It is full of good suggestions and may be obtained either from the main office in Loma Linda or from the Resource Center in Kansas City. MINNESOTA PLANNING HEALTH FRAUD CONFERENCE NCAHF members and others interested in combatting health fraud are planning a major health fraud conference in Minnesota on September 19, 1986. Interested parties should contact Edward Blonz, President of the Minnesota Council Against Health Fraud, Inc., 160 Food, Science & Nutrition, Untversity of Minnesota, 1334 Eckles Ave., St. Paul, MN 55108. RESOURCE LIST Included in this mailing is a copy of NCAHF's Available Resource Materials May, 1986. You should be aware that this listing only represents a small sample of what is actually available from NCAHF.

NOMINATIONS SOUGHT FOR NCAHF OFFICER AND BOARD POSITIONS FOR1981-1988 -- The NCAHF Nominating Committee will meet in connection with the October 24, 1986 Board of Directors meeting to be held at the Ontario, California Hilton Hotel. Send your suggestions to NCAHF Nominating Committee, P.O. Box 1276, Loma \"JOIN \" BROCHURE REVISED The NCAHF Brochure inviting people to Jo1n in combatting health fraud, misinformation and quackery has undergone some revisions that members will wish to be aware of. To help clarify the issues of primary concern to NCAHF, normative definitions will now appear for \"fraud,\" \"misinformation\" and \"quack.\" On the application panel an option is provided for applicants and renewals to indicate their membership in local chapters or statewide divisions. This enables NCAHF bookkeepers to credit local groups with 25% of the dues being paid. We've eliminated the option stating \"I want to help in council activities\" because we've never been able to make good use of it. It has been more effective for us to announce the formation of task force groups and have individuals volunteer accordingly. If you do have special expertise of value to NCAHF and wish to serve in. some way, it is most effective to simply contact us by mail or phone and discuss it. NCAHF has many activitists who really are making a dent in health fraud around the country, but they don't go at it haphazardly, rather, its become a real special interest for them. Because fighting quackery requires special skills and commitment, we are finding that it is better for highly motivated people to contact us on a personal level. Other ways to become involve include not only serving on task force groups, but organizing or being active in local chapters or coming up with individual projects. \u00b7 NCAHF will gladly give aid to individuals in planning or carrying out consumer health research or investigation projects. It is also possible to obtain some amount of financial assistance for out-of-pocket costs if the project meets NCAHF approval. SOMETHING YOU CAN DO Many health food stores produce flyers, newsletters, shopping guides and other printed materials for customer \"education.\" We find these marvelous sources of misinformation and insight into the mentality of health foods operators and customers. Whenever you run across these, please send a copy to NCAHF. Include the date and location of the place of business involved. This kind of information can serve as documentation for the degree of misinformation and subsequent potential for harm involved. Send to: \"Health food misinformation project, NCAHF, P.O.

A report will soon be published by CU in Consumer Reports magazine. Watch for it on the newstands.

If not, you should tell the library staff that they can get this useful publication for a mere $10 per year by writing to the main office at Loma Linda. TELL SOMEONE ABOUT NCAHF NCAHF is mostly dependent upon member dues for its operating budget. Statistical analysis reveals that the average NCAHF member pays $20 in dues. This puts annual income at about $36,000. The budget is based upon a $40,000 income. The remainder comes from profits from T-shirts, buttons, posters. publications and donations. Such a small economic picture limits what we can do, but most .people are amazed at just how much we don accomplish on such a small budget. We are capable of much more and will do more as resources permit. You can help by recruiting people you know agree with NCAHF0s beliefs and goals, and who will benefit from the Newsletter and other NCAHF offerings. PLEASE HELP NCAHF GROW! LOCAL MEMBERS CAN GET TOGETHER AND BE ACTIVE VITRO'UT OFFICIALUFOlOO'NG A CHAPTER --- Some members wish to actively combat health fraud in their areas but are too busy to both run a chapter and engage in activism. NCAHF is more committed to individual activism than simply creating additional organizations. A small group of members that will simply get together for moral support and idea sharing can accomplish a lot. We will provide such groups with as much assistance as we can to make their efforts successful. AFDO HEALTH FRAUD TEAM FORMED In April a regional health fraud team was estab\u00ad lished in Philadelphia by the Central Atlantic States Association of Food and Drug Officials, a regional affiliate of the Association of Food and Drug Officials (AFDO).

ENHANCING FREEDOM OF CHOICE THROUGH RELIABLE INFORMA T/ON SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER, 1986. UNITED SCIENCES OF AMERICA--IS THE SLICK SALES FIRM SLIPPING? United Sciences of America is the slickest supplement sales scheme we've ever seen. While its products don't appear to pose any direct threat to users, NCAHF observers are unanimous in our concern over the use of scare tactics employed in the promotional videos, the misinformation being disseminated regarding the condition of the environment, soils and modem foods, and the use of notable scientists' names which seem to endorse these. It now appears that some of the scientists are becoming concerned as well. We are informed that Alexander Leaf has resigned from their Scientific Advisory Board \"because of dissatisfaction with their marketing techniques and their claims that I have endorsed their products, which I have never done\" (personal communication dated August 26, 1986). Also, Eugene Braunwald, MD, is circulating a letter dated August 16, 1986, written on Harvard Medical School stationery stating, \"On June 19, 1986 I resigned from the Scientific Advisory Board and severed all my connections with United Sciences of America, Inc. At no time have I endorsed their products.\" We wonder if this isn't the beginning of a mass exodus by scientists who have to be concerned about the problems cited above. NATURE published an article describing some of USA's problems and comments in the July 10 (vol.322, p.104) Issue. GINSENG SAID TO BE A $100 MILLION PER YEAR BUSINESS E. John Staba of the Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy of the University of Minnesota's College of Pharmacy, states that the commercial Interests behind ginseng are not likely to be interested in scientific studies which might disprove the virtues or verify the side\u00ad effects of ginseng when it already is a $1 oo million business. This is the age-old dilemma posed by any questionable nostrum that is succeeding in the marketplace either because of its place in folk medicine or because of past commercialization. It's far easier to make what has been termed ''the businessman's decision\" of simply leaving well-enough alone. Staba says, \"Some ginseng research Institutes and trade associations want to establish quality control standards, but none can predict the specific health benefits to be gained from ginseng.\" (The Lancet, December 7, 1985, p.1309-1310.) '. NEWSLETTER QUALITY IN THE HEAL TH MARKETPLACE NCAHF NEWSLETTER VOL 9, No. 5 . OPEN LETTER TO SANFORD A. MILLER, DIRECTOR CENTER FOR FOOD SAFETY, FDA Dear Dr. Miller, Thank you for your letter of July 16 stating that the data which I submitted to Commissioner Young with my May 22 petition \"are not adequate to justify the sweeping imposition of warning labels on all vitamin A -containing food supplements.\" Enclosed find additional data which shows three reports to New York authorities in 1985, and one to FDA of birth defects with maternal exposure to 25,000 IU vitamin A daily (Rosa, Wilk & Kelsey, Teratology, 33:355-364). New York is the only state formally looking into the association of taking vitamin A with birth defects via its Birth Defects Registry so it is the only state finding it. Rosa, et al, conclude that there is \"reason for cautioning against long term exposures of 25,000 IU per day in women who may become pregnant'' and that ''the critical period appears to be 2-5 weeks postconceptlon, although this is clinically inexact.\" Does FDA officialdom need an epidemic of deformed newborns before they act? There may be an epidemic out there for all FDA knows, since knowledge of the relationship is so little known and therefore reporting is poor ... In my June 30 letter to Commissioner Young, I enclosed correspondence by J.B. Cordaro of the Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) that CRN members are happily selling capsules containing 25,000 IU vitamin A all over the country, even though they know (paragraph 10) that '\"It would be prudent for pregnant women to limit their intake of vitamin A from supplements to a maximum of 5,000 to 10,000 IU.\" The warning I asked the FDA to require is very simple: 'WARNING: 25,000 IU (7500RE) of vitamin A taken daily as a supplement early in pregnancy may produce permanent fetal damage. Taken for 7 to 10 years may produce liver damage in adults; smaller amounts may do so in children.\" That warning should go not only on pills, but also on bottles of cod liver oil and other products containing 25,000 IU preformed vitamin A per recommended dally dose. Mr. Cordaro's June 20 letter Indicates that his trade association of food supplement sellers has no intention of policing itself In this matter. It is the FDA's job to protect the public against irresponsible pill merchants, at least by requiring them to put warning labels on their hazardous merchandise. Sincerely, Victor Herbert, MD, JD FREE RADICALS AND THE SOUND OF QUACKERY SHIFTING GEARS Adapt or perish is the rule for survival in many areas of life including quackery. Quackery has shifted from \u00b7 blood sugar responses, to food allergies, environmental contaminants, and immune system. The new wrinkle seems to be \"free radicals.\" Like the others mentioned above, there is some scientific basis for what is being said, but the information Is being abused for the sake of selling more supplementation to an already supplement infatuated public. Some of the products using the free radical mechanism rationale presently are oral chelation products, anti-aging substances, and antioxidant formulas. PHYSICIANS CHALLENGED TO TAKE A MORE ACTIVE ROLE AGAINST HEALTH FRAUD. Grace Powers Monaco, JD, challenges physicians in her article \"The primary care physician: the first line of defense in the battle against health fraud\" that appeared in the May, 1986 edition of Medical Times (pp.43-50). Ms. Monaco describes the appeal and methods of today's quacks and what doctors can do to work against the victimization of their patients. This action-oriented article is required reading for the practicing physician who wants to act against health fraud.

FDA WARNS AGAINST DANGEROUS CANCER REMEDY FDA has issued an import alert to halt the Importation of so-called lmmuno-Augmentative Therapy (IAT) agents used by zoologist Lawrence Burton at his Bahamas-based Immunology Researching Center, Ltd. The substances not only lack evidence of effectiveness as cancer therapies but have been contaminated with hazardous substances jncluding AIDS and hepatitis viruses.

GOOD BOOK FOR HEAL TH CONSCIOUS The Fit or Fat Target Diet, by Covert Bailey has received high marks from Current Diet Review, March/April, 1986. The book is useful for people who really want to understand nutrition, not for those seeking simple formulas and diets. PRIMER ON MAIL ORDER FRAUD. The February, 1986, Consumer Reports carried an article, \"Shearing the Suckers,\" which describes the problem of mall order fraud and outlines the classic cons used by the mail order hustlers. Medical quackery is just one of many types of mail order fraud, but one can learn some basics about consumer protection even from some of the nonrnedical scams. Some of the other scams such as \"lucky charms\" are a form of mental health quackery even though they are not ordinarily thought of In such terms. Guidelines are provided on how to avoid becoming a victim. EARL MINDELL'$ SHORTCOMINGS EXPOUNDED James A. Lowell, PhD, Professor of Life Sciences at Pima Community College in Tucson and President of the Arizona Council Against Health Fraud, Inc., describes the questionable background and claims of author, pharmacist and vitamin salesman Earl Mindell in an article entitled, \"An irreverent look at The Vitamin Bible and its author,\" in the June, 1986, issue of NUTRITION FORUM. Among Mindell's shortcomings are his questionable \"PhD\" from the unaccredited University of Beverly Hills, the fact that his manuscript for The Vitamin Bible contained more than 400 errors which were pointed out to him by his adjunct faculty adviser but remained in the published edition, and his promotion of pseudovitamins such as B10, B11, B13, B15, B17 (laetrile} Mindell promotes a wide variety of nutrition pseudoscience which Lowell specifies. STUDIES LOOK AT CONSUMERS' AND PHYSICIANS' PERCEPTIONS OF HEAL TH FRAUD In connection with the FDA/Pharmaceutical Advertising Council (PAC) joint public service campaign to educate about health fraud the PAC contracted for two studies to determine consumers' and physicians' perceptions about the nature of health fraud. In a study by Glickman Research Associates, Inc., a sample of 2000 randomly selected physicians Indicated that health fraud or quackery is a serious problem. 32\"/4 felt that discussions about health fraud with patients is increasing, while 61% felt the incidence was remaining constant. The most frequently discussed topics mentioned by respondents were health foods/vitamin supplements (70%), weight reduction (63%}, misleading or unsupported claims \u00b7 (49%}, cancer treatments (36%), and arthritis treatments (29%). Approximately half of the responding physicians were aware of information sources to help patients detect or avoid fraud. The usable response rate for this study was only 11.2% making the results unreliable for the entire U.S. population of physiclans ... (Ed. comment. perhaps indicating a degree of physician apathy on the topic of health fraud). A second survey, by C/J Research, Inc., was sent to 10,000 randomly selected U.S. residents eliciting a response rate of even less (7.2%) also making it impossible to project the results to the entire U.S. population. 82\"/4 of the respondents reported having seen an ad within the past year for a fraudulent health product service. 49% claimed that they or a family member have purchased a health product or service that did not work. Weight reducers constitute the largest class of-produets-that fail. to wofl<--{3\u00a5/4),with arthritis (15%) and \"products to make you look better'' (14%) next. Others mentioned were hair or scalp products sleep aids (5%), youth prolongers (3%), and cure-alls (3%). Asked to identify one of the worst things about quackery, respondents said that it costs people needless expenditures (95%), delays people seeking legitimate care (93%), causes people to avoid seeking legitimate care and causes direct physical injury to people (73%). 43% agreed that many people are helped by unproven products or services, 29% believe there is a conspiracy among the medical profession to hold back truly effective cures, and 52% agreed that many physical ailments can be cured with with same remedy. 82% disagreed with the statement \"any kind of claimed cure is worth a try,\" while 80% disagreed that ''there is nothing wrong with a sick person trying any product or service.\" 25% believe that the government does not permit unproven treatments to be advertised and 56% agreed that testimonial advertising is convincing. (Appendix to letter from FDA Department of Consumer Affairs, May 30, 1986}. SOLUTION TO MEDICAL MALPRACTICE PROBLEM OUTLINED Physician-attorney, Victor Herbert, MD, JD, presents a logical three-pronged solution on how to resolve the malpractice problem: (1) adequate mandantory reporting of incompetence, (2) a streamlined license revocation system and (3) no-fault legislation. Dr. Herbert's remarks are published in the July, 1986, edition of The New York State Journal of Medicine, (86:(7):394-395). 2 ACSH BOOKLET: DOES NATURE KNOW BEST?

ALUMINUM FEARS ANALVZED Janet Greger, PhD, reviews the fears, facts and fantasies surrounding aluminum in the January, 1986, issue of Nutrition Forum. With concerns about Alzheimer's disease aluminum has become a topic of discussion. Old fears about aluminum cookware and more recent worries about antacid ingestion makes this a timely topic. JOHN TUGGLE DIES IN TIJUANA \"CANCER CLINIC\" New York Giant football player John Tuggle died August 29 in his sleep at American Biologics Hospital in Tijuana, Mexico where he was undergoing what is described as \"laetrile\u00ad like cancer treatments.\" NEWSDAY, September 1, 1986. BUNCO DETECTIVE DESCRIBES PSYCHIC HEAL TH FRAUDS Los Angeles Police Department detective Pat Riley of the \"Fortune-Telling\" Detail, Fraud and bunco.......Section, LAPD, provides insight. into another dimension\u00b7 of health fraud in an interview in the LASER, (March-July, 1986, pp.12-14) publication of the Southern California Skeptics. Riley describes a typical case: \"Typically a woman will have a child who is sick and maybe doctors haven't been able to help. So they come to the fortune-teller in desperation. Now, the first thing the fortune\u00ad teller does is to convince the victim that he or she has some magical powers. Usually this is done by a variety of magic tricks. For instance, one of the most common tricks is to have the victim bring in an egg from home. Then, using sleight of hand, the egg is switched and when opened is found to contain a piece of hair, or a tiny plastic skull, etc. Or, they may use the same egg and slip in a small item by sleight of hand. Now this is quite convincing because the victim is sure that it is their own egg, and couldn't possibly have been tampered with. Once the victim is convinced, the fortune-teller says that the reason their child is sick is that there is some type of curse. on them and for a fee the fortune-teller can take the curse off. Once this is done the fortune-teller demands more money to keep the curse away .... \" When asked if he believed that there were any fortune-tellers who are honest and won't pull a swindle, Riley stated that in his opinion and that of his boss who had worked in the field for 17 years, ''they are dishonest and whatever fortune-teller you pick, if you send the right person in there, they will be swindled.\" Riley notes that the real problem in enforcement involves fortune-tellers who make a pretense of religion by including pictures of crosses, Bibles, etc., or referring to themselves as ''faith healers\" in an attempt to attain protection as the free exercise of religion. AARP ARTICLE INFURIATES CHIROPRACTORS An article entitled, ''Taking command of arthritis,\" by Michael J. Briley, in the August-September issue of MODERN MATURITY (published by the American Association of Retired Persons or AARP) has raised the hackles of the editor of the chiropractic tabloid MPl'S DYNAMIC CHIROPRACTIC (Q9. Within a box labeled \"Quack remedies to avoid\" under \"Devices'' is listed \"chiropractic methods.\" This prompted a telephone call to the magazine's publishing director Robert E. Wood, who denied having called chiropractors quacks. The DC editor asked for a published statement from the chiropractic profession to \"offset the damage\" but was refused. With that the editor threatened to settle the matter ''the hard way\" and called for chiropractic supporters to call or write the Executive Director of AARP, Mr. Cy Brickfield, at 1909 \"K'' Street, NW, Washington, DC, 20049 threatening to cancel their memberships in AARP H there wasn't a \"large article of apology to the chiropractic profession.\" The editor also encouraged chiropractors who were member of one or the other of the two major chiropractic organizations to encourage their leadership to ''turn their paid legal staff loose on the AARP.\" (from DC, September, 1986, pp.38-39). COMMENT: The above incident is worthy of attention because it reveals many things important to NCAHF. First, it ls curious that a chiropractor would find it shocking that \"chiropractic methods\" were listed among \"Quack remedies to avoid\" especially under the subheading of \"Devices.\" NCAHF would ask DC's editor precisely which chiropractic devices are proven safe and effective arthritis remedies? Chiropractic has been listed by The Arthritis -Foundation as one of the remedies to \"be suspicious of' in their pamphlet Arthritis Quackery and Unproven Remedies (#4240/7- 81) so it shouldn't be surprising to see chiropractic included among the quack remedies. NCAHF and others recognize the skill of chiropractors as manipulation therapists and the value of manipulation therapy for some functional disorders, but have seen no evidence that manipulation or any other specific chiropractic methods have value for arthritis (although they may offer temporary pain relief). Perhaps it is chiropractors who should apologize to arthritis patients for their misguided colleagues who claim to have valid arthritis remedies without solid evidence. NCAHF believes that the best way for chiropractic to get off of lists of questionable treatments is to prove its value or purge its offenders. Finally, we are given a glimpse at the willingness to employ pressure tactics against anyone who dares to be publicly critical of chiropractic. Rather than providing evidence that chiropractic methods have validity, the tactic being called for is threat of economic and legal punishment. -li=lis-fr-0maR-inf1uential voice representing a guHd of practitioners that plays great lip-service to '1reedom!\" It would be legally naive for organized chiropractic to attempt a lawsuit on the. basis of the article in question. Not only did the author not call chiropractors quacks, but no single entity can purport to represent all chiropractors in such a lawsuit--especially in the case of chiropractic which has two major national organizations because they cannot agree on what a chiropractor is or what they should do. Stephen Barrett, MD has responded to AARP on behalf of NCAHF. YOUR TAP WATER MAY BE AS GOOD AS BOTTLED The bottled water industry has a fascinating history that includes the evolution of today's soft drink industry. Concern over toxic waste and environmental pollution has given new life to the bottled water business. Of course, some of it is a matter of taste. No one has to tell you that some tap water tastes bad and that bottled water tastes better. However, what about the health concerns? Johanna Omark discusses this matter in \"Bottled water--healthier than tap?\" in the March/April ACSH News & Views. The information provided on terminology used in the water marketplace is very useful. The bottom line ls that \"at the present time there is no evidence supporting the notion that bottled water is safer or nutritionally superior to tap water.\" NUTRITION CONSULTANT CERTIFICATION MILLS REVIEWED Several entrepreneurs offer impressive looking certificates that help their holders create the illusion that they are health \u00b7 professionals qualified to provide reliable nutrition information and guidance. In reality, the certificates are pieces of paper anyone can buy for a fee. The most prominent purveyors of such certificates are reviewed in useful detail in the July issue of NUTRITION FORUM. Outstanding is the American Association of Nutrition Consultants operated by Mr. Henry Holcomb of Las Vegas, Nevada. Others described include the International Association of Nutrition Consultants, the American Nutrition Consultants Association, the American Nutritional Medical Association and the American Holistic Health Sciences Association. CLOSE COOPERATION BETWEEN CANCER QUACKERY AND HEAL TH FOODS SUPPLIERS. Just how closely intertwined are the promoters of questionable cancer therapies and the companies that supply the products in the health food stores became very apparent recently when examining the equipment offered by a health food cookware supplier. Among the listings was a \"wheat grass juicer'' obviously intended for application of wheat grass cancer therapy which has no rational basis. BATH SPA WATERS One of the ancient and on-going types of quasi-therapeutics involves immersion in bath spa waters. The term \"balneotherapy'' refers to the treatment of disease by baths (Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary). O'Hare, et al, report on their observations on the effects of immersion in bath spa water in the British Medical Journal (291 1747-1751), December 21-28, 1985. Eight normal subjects were immersed in bath spa water for two hours. Significant two-fold diuresis (ie, urinary excretion) and natriuresis (ie, excretion of amounts of sodium in the urine), 5% hemodilution 0ncrease of the fluid content of blood), and a 50% increase in cardiac index (le, increased stroke volume [the amount of blood pumped in a single heart beat] and decreased peripheral resistance) were measured. The researchers compared the effects of ordinary tap water with those of the mineral springs at Bath, England and found no difference. They state that if the temperature and depth are the same so are the changes seen. HOLISTIC OPTOMETRY--A NEW VISION SCIENCE? Physicians, nurses, dentists, veterinarians and now optometrists are among the health professionals who have seen some of their ranks embrace the holistic moy~ment The ey~ an~ vision have long provided fertile ground for quacks and unorthodox practitioners and the new' holistic movement has not failed to take full advantage of the public's concern for this most precious sense. The recently formed International Society for Holistic Optometry (ISHO). P.O. Box 2172 Farmington Hills, Ml 48018, purports to be dedicated to ''total vision care with emphasi~ _on orthomolecular nutrition and optometric findings, sports vision, contact lens problems, vIsIon therapy, cataract and glaucoma control, hyperactivity in children and much more.\" The Readers of this Newsletter should find the rhetoric of this \"new'' movement all too familiar. Russell E. Pittman OD editor of the Holistic Optometrist, the self-described \"prestigeous newsletter'' of ISHO notes, ''The right hormonal balance, immunity balance and acid/alkali balance can solve many problems.\" (\"Holistic eye care may aid tolerance of contact lens,\" Optometry Times, November, 1983). Gary Scheffel OD, writes that this \"new model for patient health\" evolved \"out of the need for alternatives to 'surgery and drugs.\" Scheffel promotes providing nutritional guidance, hair analysis, biofeedback, and hypnosis within the scope of optometric practice. He ~laims _t~~t \"vitamin D: helps prevent helps of kerato<:<>nus, myopia, retinitis pigmentosa, and allergic conjunctivitis.\" He also incorporates the theones of Bats (throw away your glasses through eye exercises), Ott (\"malillumination'1, and chiropractic (\"even the spi~al column can effect your vision; into the optometry model (\"Holistic Optometry--treating the whole patient,\" Healthline, Oct/Nov 1984.) It is obvious that the holistic optometry movement is not pioneering new ground in vision care but backtracking over many theories and therapies which have been discarded or discredited by scientific medicine over the past 150 years. The Holistic optometrist promotional literature asks: 'What is Holistic Optometry .. .is it profitable?\" The answer ls obvious to all but the unsuspecting health care consumer. Russell Worrall, OD. 3 NUTRITIONIST SAYS COLLEGE ATHLETES ARE LOSING TO FOOD QUACKS Sarah Short, PhD, Professor of NutritiQn at Syracuse (NY) University, told attendees of a nutrition symposium at the annual meeting of the American College of Sports Medicine in Indianapolis that after analyzing athletes' diets for eight years she is a little discouraged to find that \"the quacks are winning. They\"re making megabucks selling products that aren't necessary, while (legitimate) nutritionists are getting poorer. Specific unfounded practices cited by Dr. Short include ingesting amino acid supplements on the notion that they will have the same effects as steroids without tell-tale urinary excretions, swallowing ground-up liver, pancreas, lungs, and testicles because they think It will help their similar organs and vitamin megadosing. Short nqtes that although we have 0strength coaches\" and \"sports psychologists, nutrition information for athletes remains haphazard. The Physician & Sportsmedlcine, August, 1986, pp.41-42. ACSH BOOKLET ON ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS ASPARTAME, CYCLAMATES AND SACCHARIN NOW AVAILABLE FROM NCAHF One of the most requested ACSH review booklets has been the one on artificial sweeteners published In July, 1984. ACSH has updated that excellent report and reissued it in August, 1986. These may be obtained by sending $2 and a stamped, self-addressed envelope to the NCAHF Resource Center in Kansas City. VITAMIN CVS CANCER DEBATED Charles Moertel, MD and Linus Pauling, PhD, debate the value of megadoses of vitamin C In the treatment of cancer patients in the January, 1986, Nutrition Reviews (44:28-32). This article provides a clear view of the claims and evidence in this matter. CARNIVORA Carnivora is a derivative from the insectivorous plant known as the Venus's flytrap. It is said to be taking Western Europe by storm as an alleged cancer remedy. Varro Tyler, PhD, Dean of the Schools of Pharmacy, Nursing and Health Sciences, at Purdue University reviewed the unproven status of carnlvora and its current popularity In the November, 1985 Nutrition Forum. MANIPULATING THE MEDIA \"Advertising in disguise\" is a revelation by Consumer Reports on how public relations people and other hucksters make the promotion of their products seem to be news rather than purely advertising. Its worth reading for those of you who would like to see a clear separation of commercial language and truly . newsworthy Information. THE NATIONAL COUNCIL AGAINST HEALTH FRAUD, INC. P.O.

NEW YORK TASK FORCE RECOMMENDS LEGISLATIVE REFORMS TO CURTAIL HEALTH FRAUD The Assembly Republican Task Force on Health Fraud and the Elderly (under the direction of Republican Leader C.D. Rappelyea, and chaired by Peter M. Sullivan of the 87th District, Westchester County), has completed months of study which Included public hearings, staff research and cooperative investigations with other agencies such as the FDA, and issued a special report that could serve as a model for the nation. NCAHF has been aware of the Task Force's work and participated to some degree. Most outstanding is the fact that to our knowledge New York is the only state to make a significant legislative effort to respond to the shocking findings of the 1984 hearing held by Rep. Claude Pepper who determined that health fraud was the number one consumer fraud problem among the elderly. Despite widespread publicity about the billions of dollars quackery costs the nation every year and the revelations about the need for stronger laws and better enforcement, most lawmakers have remained silent This may either be due to the influence of well-heeled organizations which profit from quackery or simply the absence of a vocal constituency crying out for action. In any case, The New York Assembly has acted admirably to the realization that consumers are being exploited. The report addresses some critical Issues and makes specific recommendations. These are summarized below. ISSUE: The necessity to subject diets, foods and dietary supplements making health claims to the same regulations and rigorous standards as drugs. RESPONSE: In light of this loophole in current law, the Task Force has expanded the definition of health fraud to Include such products. Proposed is the following: ''The promotion, for financial gain, of fraudulent devices, treatments, services, plans or products (including. but not limited to food, diet and nutritional supplements) which alter or claim to alter the human condition.\" ISSUE: Ineffective penalties for false advertising. RESPONSE: The Task Force has Introduced legislation, A.10184 and A.10185, which would toughen the state sanctions for fraudulent advertising of health care products. A.10184 would Increase the penalty of false advertising of a health care product from a Class A misdemeanor to a Class E felony (punishable by up to four years In prison.) A.10185 would Increase the present fine for false advertising of NEWSLETTER QUALITY IN THE HEAL TH MARKETPLACE NCAHF NEWSLETTER a health product from $500 to $25,000, plus the reasonable costs of prosecution as incurred by the State Office of the Attorney General. ISSUE: Insufficient media self-regulation. RESPONSE: the Task Force has proposed A.10188, a bill that would assure the media freedom from liability of accepted advertisements for health products and services, if such advertisements are accompanied by a certificate of approval from the FDA or the state Department of Health. ISSUE: Misleading and/or Illegal use of credentials. RESPONSE: The Task Force has Introduced A.10189, a bill that would prohibit the use of the title \"doctor'' unless the user of such title Is: (a) \"A medical doctor licensed as such or (b) those holding doctorates in health fields (including, but not limited to, nursing, nutrition, veterinary science, ophthalmology and dentistry) from an accredited university or college, and then only with respect to the scientific body of knowledge In relation to which such doctorate Is held, when promoting for sale any device, treatment, service, plan or product (including, but not limited to, food, diet and nutritional supplements) which alters or claims to alter the human condition.\" In addition, the bill would make the misuse of the title \"doctor'' a Class A misdemeanor. ISSUE: Fraudulent and deceptive practices. RESPONSE: A.10186 was introduced by the Task Force in order to require licensure for the sale of door-to-door health products. The bill reads: \"No person, firm association, corporation, agent or employee shall sell devices, treatments, services, plans .or products (Including but not limited to, diets, foods, and nutritional supplements) which alter or claim to alter the human oondition .unless such person ... holds a license to do so from the state Department of Health.\" ISSUE: Insufficient Investigative resources to Identify and track health fraud. RESPONSE: The Task Force has Introduced legislation that would create a Health Fraud Task Force within the state Attorney General's Office. This Task Force would have primary responsibility for Identifying and tracking Incidents of health fraud occurring within New York State and would act In conjunction with federal agencies, as well as the state Consumer Protection Board, to prosecute such health fraud incidents. ISSUE: No FDA jurisdiction for Intra-state health fraud and prosecution. RESPONSE: (After noting that the Postal Service has both interstate and Intrastate jurisdiction oyer mail fraud and that the FDA is VOL 9 NO 6 the primary agent In health fraud detection, they say) ... The Task Force has introduced a resolution which memorializes Congress to enact changes In the law in order to permit the FDA to prosecute intrastate cases of health fraud. This resolution was adopted by the state Assembly on April 1, 1986. ISSUE: Lack of public awareness. RESPONSE: The Task Force has introduced A.10187, a bill that would formulate a public education program on health-care fraud. The state Consumer Protection Board would be given responsibility for the establishment of this program and \u00b7 for the dissemination of educational materials to the public. We don't know how much of the foregoing has been enacted Into law, but these concrete responses to the key issues identified by the Task Force provide a practical basis for seeking action. Lawmakers serious about protecting the public from the deception and exploitation that characterizes quackery must face up to the necessity of the kinds of legislative action called for or come up with viable alternatives. Complete copies of the 25-page report may be obtained from NCAHF for $3 postage paid. FDA ISSUES ALERT ON NIEPER \"THERAPIES\" The U.S. Food & Drug Administration advises that the treatments for cancer, heart disease and multiple sclerosis promoted by West German physician Hans A. Nieper have never been submitted for approval. Nieper's therapies Include for cancer: the discredited cancer drug laetrile, and other unproved substances such as lscador, fresh cell potassium orotate for which the American Heart Association says there are no significant data indicating efficacy; and for MS: calcium products, including calcium aninoethyl phosphate, or CaEAP, frequently prescribed as part of an expensive program of massive drug intake and special diets--Nieper's MS therapy is strongly advised against by the German Multiple Sclerosis Society and labeled unproven by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in the U.S. Patients have been misled to believe that international law or World Health Organization regulations permit the importation of drugs prescribed abroad. This is not true. FDA Is now working with the U.S. Customs Service to halt the illegal flow of Nleper therapies. (FDA Talk Paper T86-64, August 15, 1986; contact: Bill Grigg (301) 443-4177).

DUBIOUS NUTRITIONAL METHODS OF CANCER PREVENTION AND TREATMENT REVIEWED Victor Herbert, MD, JD, provides the hardest\u00ad hitting article to date on the tremendous and growing problems of misleading and fraudulent dietary and nutritional claims for the prevention and/or treatment of cancer. As Herbert points out, the problem includes but is not limited to charlatanism. There are also serious distortions being made by people within the regular health sciences who are making inappropriate and unjustified inferences that are being translated into public policy. These distortions not only cloud the truth but become cannon fodder for more serious forms of quackery. Herbert names the people and organizations engaged in questionable nutrition-related cancer activities with the forthrightness we have come to expect from him. His article \"Unproven (questionable} dietary and nutritional methods of cancer prevention and treatment,\" (Supplement to Cancer, 58:1930-1941, October 15, 1986) is required reading for anyone interested in cancer quackery and distortions of nutrition science related to cancer. in the past is that the studies are pretty good. To date, the report notes, NACM has attracted NCAHF is founded on the cannons of only a small portion of the profession. consumerism and science which state that Among the examples of \"problem situations health products should not be promoted until gathered during field visits\" were: practice- reasonably demonstrated to be safe and building courses advocating \"advertising effective for their intended purposes.

' 2 start of this investigation is noted, as were other questionable billing practices not limited to chiropractors. Indications of whether or not these problems are greater among chiropractors than other health care providers on a per capita basis is not presented, but discussions about their futile attempts to demonstrate the existence of \"subluxations\" by x-ray as required by Medicare lead the reader to surmise that this is a greater problem among chiropractors. The OIG recommendations included vigorous opposition to expanded coverage of chiropractic services, and that legislation should be considered that would continue to limit Medicare coverage to manual manipulation of the spine to correct a subluxation demonstrated by x-ray and cap the number of services for which a patient could receive payment to 12 per year. Many of the recommendations have economic overtones, but there is much that relates to the validity of chiropractic and its practices.

Kerr and Yarborough report a case of pancreatitis in a 34-year-old male in The New England Journal of Medicine, 314:1642-1643, June 19, 1986, following ingestion of a homeopathic remedy. The remedy was prescribed by a chiropractor who had treated the patient for neck pain when the patient also complained of lack of energy. The chiropractor dispensed 100 of the tablets with instructions to take two tablets every 15 minutes until he felt better, and then four tablets daily. After ingesting 16 tablets the patient experienced severe epigastric pain which persisted with other symptoms. Correspondence with the supplier, Biological Homeopathic Remedies in Albuquerque, NM, revealed that 40-45% of persons ingesting the tablets experience a \"healing crisis.\" The authors conclude that homeopathic remedies should be available on a prescription basis only to prevent their abuse. MEGAVITAMINS: USES AND ABUSES A brief article by Evans and Lacey entitled \"Toxicity of vitamins: complications of a health movement'' appeared in the Feb 22, 1986 (292:509-10) BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL. In addition to some insights gained from visits to London health food stores, the authors provide convenient tables presenting \"conditions for which treatment with megadoses of vitamins appear well supported\" and \"toxic effects of vitamins ... \" \"YEAST CONNECTION\" AND CLINICAL ECOLOGY DISCREDITED BY AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ALLERGY The highly promoted notion that symptoms such as fatigue, lethargy, depression, inability to concentrate, gastrointestinal problems and much more are apt to be due to hypersensitivity to Candida albicans is dubbed unproven by the American Academy of Allergy in a position statement published in the August, 1986, Journal of Allergy & Clinical Immunology (78:271-273). The same issue contains a position statement that \"clinical ecology'' has not been scientifically established and is to be regarded as \"unproven and experimental.\" USA CALLS FOR PRESSURE ON FDA TO STOP CONSUMER PROTECTION REGULATIONS . ' In a letter dated October 10, 1986, to Clinical Advisory Board Members Senior Vice-President and Medical Director of United Sciences of America, Inc., Jeffery Fisher, MD, states that FDA \"is currently entertaining a motion to bar medical claims from nutritional products. This could affect USA, Inc's ability to promote the attributes of our preventive health program. A great deal of positive evidence now supports this company's products, yet due to the nature of research and the scientific community, there is a lack of a conclusive quorum.\" In an attempt to \"forestall\" FDA's effort, Fisher asks members to write to the FDA and underscore the merit of the concepts and products marketed by USA. Fisher states that in the future members may be asked to personally call the FDA \"in a combined effort to strongly communicate (USA's) position on this issue.\" COMMENT: This is an example of how things get done. Obviously, USA has a vested interest in seeing that the current \"buyer beware\" situation relative to marketing dietary plans and supplements is maintained. Undoubtedly, many who share that vested interest will respond and put pressure on the FDA not to act. This is the time for NCAHF's proconsumer protection constituency to make itself heard by writing in favor of FDA's plan to bar medical claims from nutrition products.

BIAS QUESTIONED AMONG PROPONENTS OF DIET REFORM FOR HEART DISEASE A controversy that just won't go away involves just how effective major dietary changes are apt to be in reducing coronary heart disease. An article in Medical World News, (May 26, 1986) suggests that the current emphasis upon diet as a primary preventive measure is more related to the biases of the proponents than the quality of their evidence. Although the recommended dietary changes (le, limiting fat intake to 30% of which no more than 10% is saturated, and keeping cholesterol below 300 mg/day) are not harmful for adult males, there is no evidence-\u00ad and a good deal of counter-evidence--that such is unnecessary and could be bad for women and children. NCAHF's concern is that public health information be kept highly credible. This means either advancing only those practices which have a solid scientific basis or including strong qualifying disclaimers that cannot be separated from the overall message so that people can be aware that the information they are receiving on diet and heart disease is uncertain. Experience teaches us that fringe practitioners invariably pick up on public health messages and then push them to extremes for their own purposes. Policy\u00ad makers need to be aware that their messages will become fodder for quackery to feed upon and act wisely. OSTEOPATHIC MANIPULATION AND SPINAL CORD DAMAGE. Davis reports on three cases of osteopathic manipulation that resulted in acute spinal cord injury requiring surgery. The author questions the use of manipulation in the absence of scientific documentation of beneficial effects of such treatment (British Medical Journal, Nov 30, 1985 (291:1540-1541). ' 3 OHIO'S INADEQUATE CHILD-NEGLECT LAW CITED AS CAUSE OF CHILD'S DEATH A 23-month-old child from Mercer County in western Ohio died recently of pneumonia and bronchitis, both treatable illnesses. Sadly, her parents who are members of the Faith Assembly which rejects medicine in favor of faith healing. Ohio law exempts parents from child-neglect charges if the child is treated by faith healing practices of a recognized religion such as Christian Science. The Mercer County prosecutor is proceeding with charges against the parents in this case despite the possibility they may get off on the basis of religious exemption. This is the third Faith Assembly child to have died within his jurisdiction. In previous cases he didn't file charges because of the nature of the law, but the third death was too much so he has decided to take his chances on a conviction. At least he feels that he may call attention to the fatal flaws in the Ohio law that places children in jeopardy because of the religious beliefs of their parents. The U.S. Supreme Court has said that adults have the right to refuse medical care, but have no right to make martyrs of their children. fWhen faith is fatal,\" Akron Beacon Journal, May 12, 1986). COMMENT: If you are shocked by these apparently needless deaths of children you will be even more disturbed to know that.these are not uncommon. According to the Spring, 1986, Issue of C.H.I.L.D Newsletter, several more Faith Assembly children have died in the past year. Included are: 9-year-old Bradley Hoover of Elkhart, Indiana, who died of peritonitis; 13- year-old Ira Hathaway of Elkhart County Indiana who died of diabetic shock; and, the newborn infant of Lucy Wellman, 27, who also died during a home delivery without medical supervision at Noblesville, Indiana. Also reported is the probable needless death of a 2. 1/2 year-old Christian Science child in Boston on April 8.

NOTE: NCAHF'S Board of Directors approved a $500 grant to C.H.I.L.D. to aid in the publication of a monograph entitled: \"Children, Religion and Medicine\" for publication in Current Problems in Pediatrics in late 1986. HAZARDS OF INVERSION DEVICE A Melbourne, Australia researcher has found that an upside-down inversion exercise device can double the blood pressure and put people in peril of a stroke. Ironically, the equipment is promoted as a therapy with a host of alleged benefits Including stimulating mental activity, memory and eyesight. Chris Spanos of Phillip Institute stated that the equipment could help improve posture and alleviate spinal problems but dismissed the other health claims. (Sun, Melbourne, Australia, May 6, 1986). NEJM RAPS USA, INC. The October 9, 1986 New England Journal of Medicine (315:971-973) published two pieces very critical of United Sciences of America promotions. A letter by John Renner, MD, points out the doubtful validity of USA's claim that their high-priced food supplements, protein powder and candy bars constitute \"a highly effective program for optimal health. An article by Frederick Stare, MD, takes USA to task for its promotional tactics and criticizes people from the scientific community who are lending their names to its marketing hyperbole. BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION REPORT ON \"ALTERNATIVE\" THERAPY iridology, macro.biotics, manipulation, osteopathy ' & chiropractic, naturopathy, and falsehoods, overlaid with disparagement not only of scientific conclusions but of logical reason Itself.\" The book Is recommended not only for health professionals but legislators who are often deceived by the promoters of irresponsible health care. orthomolecular treatment, polarity, Radionics, and reflexology. Coples of the report may be obtained from the British Medical Association, BMA House, Tavistock Square, London WC1H 9JP, for$27.50. In the previous Issue of this newsletter we reported briefly on the British Medical Association's (BMA) report, ALTERNATIVE THERAPY, that Is the result of a study by an a\u00ad member task force (called a \"Working party\" by the BMA). NCAHF has obtained a copy of the 164-page report and finds It interesting and useful. The report should be included In any basic library on health fraud, quackery or pseudoscience. The monograph contains much more than mere descriptions of various nonscientific approaches to health care. It reviews the history of scientific medicine In a most concise a readable fashion, and describes how we come to know what Is valid through research, testing, and analysis. Included among the \"alternative therapies\" reviewed are: acupuncture, aromatherapy, Bach Flower Remedies, Healing, Hellerwork, herbalism 0ncludlng an appendix of adverse reactions to herbal medicines), homeopathy, hypnotherapy, NCAHF has received permission from the BMA to reproduce small portions of the report.

Many have been in contact with the main office. Interested parties should identify themselves to Marie Ekvall, c/o Food & Drug Administration, 433 W. Van Buren, Room 1222, Chicago, IL 60607; (312) 353-7126. PILLS VS. FOOD PRESS TOUR IN ILLINOIS NCAHF'sWTTTiam Jarvis, PhD and Victor Herbert, MD, JD, teamed up with Bess Dawson-Hughes, MD, Assistant Medical Director of the USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Boston's Tufts University for presentations in Rockford and Chica~o, several radio and television appearances, and a number of newspaper interviews on the problem of oversupplementation by the public. Media interest was heightened by a desperate press release by the Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN). Despite its self-aggrandizing name, CRN is a trade association representing over 70 nutrition supplement sellers. CRN vainly attempted to pose Jarvis, Herbert and Hughes as spokespeople for the dairy industry (an amusing example of the pot calling the kettle \"blackn even if it were true!) because the trip was sponsored by the Dairy Nutrition Council, Inc., an Illinois affiliate of the National Dairy Council (NOC). Unlike CRN, NOC and its affiliates are non-profit educational entities financed mainly by assessments on dairymen. Herbert and Hughes each spoke for themselves and Jarvis spoke for NCAHF which is a co-sponsor of the \"Pills vs. Food\" project. Messages delivered to the media were simply that people should get their nutrition from food rather than pills, no one should supplement above the RDAs, that FDA should require warning labels on supplements with potential for harm, and that health care professionals should be alert for signs of toxicity and include questions about supplement practices when taking health histories. IOWA NUTRITION COUNCIL VOTES TO JOIN EFFORTS WITH NCAHF NCAHF's newest member organization is the former Iowa Nutrition Council which has voted to reorganize as the Iowa Council Against Health and Nutrition Fraud, Inc. (ICAHNF), a state-wide division of NCAHF. Iowa NCAHF members who wish to also become part of ICAHNF should contact Teresa Breidinger, 110 Wren, Ames, IA 50010; (515) 232- 9453 after 6 pm.

JUDGE DISMISSES SLANDER SUIT AGAINST VICTOR 'HERBERT \u00b7t . t Carlton Fredericks initiated a lawsu1 aga1ns Victor Herbert about two years ago based upon a public statement in which Herbert stated that Frederick's claim to nutrition expertise was based upon his lack of training in nutrition and a conviction for practicing nutrition quackery. The suit was handled by the New York law firm of Ba~s and Ullman which also handled the harassment su1t brought by the National Nutritional Foods Association against Frederick Stare and Elizabeth Whelan in 1978 which was dismi~sed wi~h a wa~n~ng not to attempt to use such tact1cs aga1~st cr1~1cs of the health foods industry. The ~u1t aga1nst Herbert was dismissed for lack of mer1t. VOLUNTEERS IN LOS ANGELES AREA NEEDED Each year Opportunities andServices for Seniors, a nonprofit charitable information and referral organization serving the 50+ population, puts on an ANNUAL TIME OF YOUR LIFE EXPO at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The EXPO usually has around 450 exhibitors and 40,000 attendees\u00b7. NCAHF has had a booth in the past and is urged by the organizers to have another this coming year. The problem is finding volunteers to attend the booth. Two people per shift is desired with attendants working 4 hour shifts. The dates are April 25, 26 & 27, 1987. If you are willing to volunteer, please contact William Jarvis at NCAHF. If we can locate enough volunteers we will sign-on for a baoth. J NEW ANTI-CONSUMER PROTECTION ORGANIZATIONS NCAHF has become aware of two new organizations dedicated to the Caveat Emptor (ie, buyer beware) philosophy. One is the Coalition for Alternatives in Nutrition and Healthcare, Inc. (CANAH) operated by Catherine J. Frompovich, PhD (from unaccreditted Columbia Pacific University in California), P.O. Box B-12, Richlandtown, PA 18955. CANAH parrots the standard distortions of \"freedom of choice,\" imaginings of conspiracies, attacks on efforts to improve consumer protection, and so forth. The second is the Health Alternatives Legal Foundation (HALF) led by a group of attorneys who claim to \"advocate competition in the health care marketplace and individual freedom to choose from among competing schools of practice.\" HALF spouts the misconception that regular medicine is nallopathic and maintains a monopoly over other philosophical approaches to healing. It is impossible on the surface to determine if HALF is simply made up of opportunistic attorneys wishing to exploit the conflict situation which exists between responsible and irresponsible health care or if they are devoted to an extremist libertine philosophy. In either case, HALF brings no new propositions to the debate between quackery and science; rather, it recites the old distortions and seeks confrontation in the nation's courts. HALF's address is 105 North Foster St Dothan, Alabama 36303. CANAH's Frompovich is a member of HALF's Board of Directors. PREVENTION MAGAZINE PUBLISHES PRO-LICENSURE OF NUTRITIONISTS ARTICLE - You may have heard rumblings to the effect that Prevention magazine has adopted a new policy of providing scientifically valid information. Frankly, were-nept1ca1but-at least one article lives up to such standards. Its \"Should nutritionists be licensed?\" in which the magazine supports licensure of qualified nutrition counselors and criticizes the health food store type of nutrition consulting. You can obtain a free reprint of the article by sending a stamped, self-addressed, business-sized envelope to: Licensing Reprint, P.O. Box 1747, Allentown, PA, 18105. SKEPTICS' JOURNAL SEEKS WRITERS ON HEALTH NONSENSE Kendrick Frazier, editor of the skejitlciT Inquirer solicits articles, books, reviews, _and news items on fringe claims in health and medicine for publication in SI.

QUACKERY ABROAD An NCAHF member who spent his summer vacation in his native country, Spain, reports that quackery is rampant there. His collection of exhibits are promotions for magical bracelets, naprapathy (massage therapy), chiropractic, tanning pills, ginseng, water ionizers, reflexology devices, and more. Another communication received from a native of and recent visitor to Malaysia reports rampant health fraud and specifically mentioned bee pollen promotions as a leading hoax. NCAHF CHIROPRACTIC POSITION PAPER USED IN EVIDENCE IN COURT CASE On August 4-7, 1986, suit was brought against a national insurance carrier by a policyholder in Chillicothe, Ohio, Court of Common Pleas. The plaintiff sought payment of all medical payments incurred as a result of falling over her cat when she moved off a kitchen stool at home. In addition she sought attroney's fees and $1,000,000 in punitive damages citing bad faith on the ~art of the insurance carrier. The plaintiff used chiropractic services in excess of $6,000 in addition to other medical costs. A NCAHF oriented chiropractor testified for the insurance company offering the NCAHF Position Paper .2!!. Chiropractic and Rational Chirooractic Services as documents attesting to tile differences between rational and irrational chiropractic care. The jury awarded the plaintiff $5,200 for total medically necessary services, denied payment of attorney's fees and the punitive damages. This was substantially less than the insurance company had offered to settle for prior to the trial. {Reported by NCAHF member Charles E. DuVall, DC, Akron, Ohio). NCAHF HELPS FUND IRIDOLOGY STUDY The pseudoscience of iridology purports to be able to locate diseases and trauma within the body by carefully observing irregularities appearing upon the iris of the eye. Iridology is based upon a story of a boy who allegedly discovered the phenomenon when he broke his pet owl's leg while at play. NCAHF has gathered a substantial amount of information on iridology and once came very close to conducting a study of its validity--the proponents backed out when another study failed to validate their claims. Now a group at the School of Optometry_ at the .Unlv.el\"Sit.y of -California at Berkeley are carrying out a pr~spective study of varsity athletes (football, rugby, and ski teams). The athletes irises have been photographed before season and those who suffer lower leg trauma will be re-photographed for analysis. NCAHF has provided a $300 grant to help defray costs of film and processing. Studies such as this are difficult to fund because many funding agencies will not provide money for researching such unconventional th~ories. At NCAHF we realize that many people take iridology seriously and harm has come from reliance upon it. NCAHF encourages the scientific study of popular, unproven theories of health and disease.
