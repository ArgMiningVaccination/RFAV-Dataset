The brand claims that it can provide \"clean energy\" to fuel you physically, and also that it increases mental focus and energy. But does Mr. Hyde Pre-Workout contain research-backed ingredients for improving energy? What about for increasing strength? Does it contain any unhealthy additive ingredients? And how do real users rate and describe the effects of Mr. Hyde Pre-Workout? In this article we'll answer all of these questions and more as we analyze the ingredients in Mr. Hyde Pre-Workout based on medical studies to give our take on whether it's likely to be effective or if it's a waste of money. We'll share our thoughts about whether the supplement is likely to cause side effects, explain why it was recalled in the past, and feature real, unsponsored Mr. Hyde Pre-Workout user reviews. This supplement contains a wide range of ingredients so we'll break our ingredient analysis into two sections: active ingredient analysis and inactive ingredient analysis. Active Ingredient Analysis The active ingredients in Mr. Hyde Pre-Workout are shown above. Beta alanine is an effective ingredient that can increase power. A [clinical trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32833890/) published in The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found that this ingredient prevented fatigue and increased power in athletes at a 1.2 gram (g) dose, which is less than that in Mr. Hyde. Creatine can also increase power, but may be underdosed at only 1 g dose. As we documented in our [Con Cret Creatine review](https://illuminatelabs.org/blogs/health/con-cret-creatine-review) article, clinical research suggests that the effective maintenance creatine dose is around 2.5 g. Caffeine is included in almost all pre-workout supplements, and for good reason. A [medical review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34291426/) published in the Sports Medicine journal found that it increases power and reduces fatigue. The 169 milligram (mg) dose in Mr. Hyde Pre-Workout is an effective dose. Nitrosigine and citrulline are shown in a 2020 [clinical trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7041093/) to increase blood flow in young athletes, but at a dose of 1.5 g and 8 g, respectively. The doses in Mr. Hyde are only 500 mg and 500 mg, and we can't find clinical evidence backing such low doses. Choline is often included in pre-workout supplements, but we're not sure why. A [medical review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3435905/) published in the Sports Health journal analyzed data from three clinical trials on choline supplementation, and found that there was no significant benefit in any of the three trials. The remaining active ingredients are included at too low of a dose to have any benefit for exercise performance in our opinion. Overall, we consider Mr. Hyde likely to improve exercise performance and endurance given its effective dose of caffeine and beta alanine. However, we aren't particularly impressed with the formulation given that this is two active ingredients that we consider effectively dosed out of 11 total. But the main reason we recommend avoiding Mr. Hyde Pre-Workout is due to its inactive ingredients, which we'll examine in the next section. Inactive Ingredient Analysis There are a number of inactive ingredients in this pre-workout powder that we consider questionable from a health perspective. FD&C Blue #1 is an artificial food dye. A [medical review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23026007/) on the toxicology of food dyes reported negative health effects from all currently-approved food dyes. Artificial flavors were shown in a [clinical trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28832835/) on animals to be toxic. Sucralose is an artificial sweetener shown to cause negative changes to insulin levels, as we referenced in our review of [the Feel Great System](https://illuminatelabs.org/blogs/health/feel-great-system-review). Acesulfame potassium is another artificial sweetener. Citric acid is commonly derived from a fungus when used in manufacturing, and is [clinically shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6097542/) to cause whole-body inflammation in a small subset of individuals. Natural flavors is a healthier choice than artificial flavors in our opinion, but there are toxicity concerns regarding some natural flavoring agents [in clinical research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15093265/). This is one of the longest lists of questionable inactive ingredients in any supplement we've reviewed on Illuminate Health. But how do real users describe the supplement's effects? We'll review in the next section. Why Was Mr. Hyde Pre-Workout Recalled? Mr. Hyde Pre-Workout was recalled in 2016 [according to](https://clarksnutrition.com/index.php/blog/recalls/2016/04/recall-dr-jeykll-mr-hyde-dietary-supplements) Clark's Nutrition. The recall was apparently due to an unapproved drug ingredient called picamilon being included. Picamilon is not allowed for use in dietary supplements [according to](https://www.fda.gov/food/dietary-supplement-products-ingredients/picamilon-dietary-supplements) the FDA, and has lacking safety data. ProSupps also received a [warning letter](https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/prosupps-usa-llc-505396-02032017) from the FDA in 2017 for \"significant violations\" of good manufacturing practice. According to the letter, the manufacturer of Dr. Hyde failed to follow written procedures for the investigation of customer complaints, and failed to establish proper quality control procedures. This is a red flag about the company as a whole in our opinion. Real, Unsponsored Mr. Hyde Pre-Workout Reviews A YouTube fitness creator named \"b5lifting\" reviewed Mr. Hyde Pre-Workout: A TikTok fitness influencer named Andrew Burgess gave the pre-workout a mediocre score: Reviews Part 1: Mr. Hyde! [#fitness] [#gymlife] [#preworkout] [ original sound - Andrew Burgess] Will Mr. Hyde Pre-Workout Cause Side Effects? Mr. Hyde Pre-Workout doesn't appear to have been studied in any clinical trials, so it's impossible to say for certain whether or not it causes side effects. However, we can make an educated guess based on its active ingredients. Pre-workouts are generally more likely to cause side effects than most supplements due to all of the stimulants they contain. Caffeine can cause jitteriness and anxiety in those who are caffeine sensitive, though the dose in Mr. Hyde is only around two cups of coffee which probably won't have a negative effect on most individuals. Beta alanine has been shown in a 2012 [medical review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22777329/) to cause an uncomfortable tingling sensation at the dose included in Mr. Hyde, and this side effect is also reported by a number of individuals online. Artificial dyes like Blue 1 can cause hyperactivity in some people (especially in children and adolescents) according to the medical review linked in the inactive ingredient section. We consider Mr. Hyde somewhat likely to cause side effects overall. Where to Buy Mr. Hyde Pre-Workout for the Best Price Mr. Hyde Pre-Workout is sold at a variety of online retailers. Here's the price breakdown at the time of publishing this article: Brand website: $19.98 $19.98 (free shipping depending on plan - [link to official Amazon listing](https://amzn.to/3KM1OdZ)) Those who can get free shipping on Amazon reduce the overall price by around 25%. Real Customer Reviews of Mr. Hyde Pre-Workout Amazon reviews are a more honest source of customer reviews than a brand's website in our opinion. Mr. Hyde Pre-Workout has an average review rating of 4.4 out of 5 and has been reviewed over 10,000 times on Amazon. The top positive review from a verified purchaser is written by a user named \"Ella\" who claims the product is powerful: \"Great workout powder! I only use half of scoop as I feel a full scoop is too much for me but it really helps with my 5am workouts!\" The top negative review from a verified purchaser comes from a user named \"Lorenzo Aranda\" who's upset about a recent reduction in the ingredient potency: \"Did anyone else notice the difference in color now? How about the fact that they halved the concentration of the key ingredients for the same price? Sneaky. Essentially it's just fluff loaded with caffeine.\" Our Clean Pre-Workout Picks The pre-workout supplement we recommend is [Naked Energy](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1150909&u=3153363&m=78253&urllink=nakednutrition%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fpre%2Dworkout%2Dpowder&afftrack=) by Naked Nutrition. Like Mr. Hyde, it provides an effective dose of beta alanine and caffeine for power and stamina improvements.
