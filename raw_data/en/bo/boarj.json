It reverberates outwards through families, friends and communities. An issue that affects all of us so deeply can only be addressed by involving as many people as possible in local communities, voluntary organisations, state bodies and health services along with ordinary people across the whole county. Connecting for Life Cork is a response to Ireland's national strategy to reduce suicide between 2015 and 2020. It takes the national goals and objectives and clearly sets out a series of actions for Cork. Wide-ranging consultation took place with communities, agencies and individuals which make this a truly local plan, and I wish to pay tribute to the many people who have played a role in bringing it together. It's important that this cross-community approach continues as the plan is implemented. No one person or body can tackle this issue alone. As former Taoiseach Enda Kenny TD stated in his introduction to the national Connecting for Life strategy, it is our connections to family, friends and community that protect us from isolation. It is those same connections that we need to draw on in implementing the plan. We now have an opportunity to build on the momentum captured in the consultation process. The next challenge for all involved is to implement it and to measure the impact. We in the Community Healthcare Organisation look forward to working with all to implement this important plan. Ger Reaney Chief Officer, Cork and Kerry Community Healthcare Organisation Connecting for Life Cork 2017 - 20203 A Word From the Chief Executive Of Cork County Council As Chief Executive of Cork County Council I wholeheartedly support Connecting for Life Cork. By working together across organisations and communities we will strengthen the message that mental health is applicable to us all. I am acutely aware of the importance of positive mental health in all areas of our lives. Only recently, Cork County Council established a Physical Activity and Wellbeing Office, the first of its kind in the country, while our Social Inclusion and Community Strategic Policy Committee consistently promote mental health initiatives. As a Council, we will promote Connecting for Life Cork and support its implementation. We will assist in every way possible towards a reduction in the rate of suicide and self-harm and promote positive mental health. Tim Lucey Chief Ex ecutive, Cork County Council A Word From The Chief Executive Of Cork City Council As Chief Executive of Cork City Council I welcome the development & publication of Connecting for Life Cork which is the local implementation of the National Strategy to Reduce Suicide 2015-2020. This plan was created by working in partnership with all relevant stakeholders which reflects the fact that mental health promotion is everybody's business. Cork City Council is committed to supporting and promoting the implementation of this plan to reduce the rates of suicide and to promote positive mental health in all areas of our lives, and this is a key element of 'Pure Cork' the Local Economic & Community Plan for Cork City 2016-2021. I would like to acknowledge the work and commitment of all the key par tners involved in the development of Connecting for Life Cork and I look forward to continuing our work together on this collaborative and systematic approach to suicide prevention and self-harm reduction in Cork. Ann Doherty Chief Ex ecutive, Cork City Council Connecting for Life Cork 2017 - 20204 A word from the Director of the National Office for Suicide Prevention Connecting for Life, Ireland's National Strategy to Reduce Suicide 2015 - 2020 sets a minimum target of a 10% reduction in the suicide rate in I reland by 2020. The achievement of this challenging target will r ely upon an all of go vernment, all of society approach. T he key challenge of tr anslating national policy into local implementation in a consistent , eff ective and efficient manner is acknowledged . C onnecting for Life Cork is the local response to the national strategy, and it connects key partners from the statutory, NGO, community and voluntary sectors. It has taken the national goals, objectives and actions and, taking account of views of the people in Cork City and County, actions have been prepared under the national strategic goals. It is important that we continually monitor and learn from the implementation of Connecting for Life Cork. This is important not alone for the communities in Cork, but also so that improved learning and understanding about suicide prevention and reducing self-harm can be shared nationally and internationally. It is only by connecting and pooling our expertise, resources and energy and by working together in a spirit of real cooperation, that we can achieve our goal. Gerry Raleigh Director, National Office for Suicide Prevention Connecting for Life Cork 2017 - 20205 Acknowledgements The development of Connecting for Life Cork has been a truly collaborative process and it is very important to acknowledge all of the individuals and families who took part, especially those who gave their time for the community consultations across Cork City and County. The work involved in suicide prevention carries deep personal meaning for so many people and the personal investment of time and passionate interest is a vital part of Connecting for Life Cork. Many of those that contributed brought the experience of bereavement through suicide to the consultation process, and this contribution is acknowledged as both extremely generous at a personal level and invaluable in informing future suicide prevention efforts. I especially would like to acknowledge ReachOut.com, for the provision of a number of photographs used throughout this document. In my view, the use of such beautiful images, humanises the appropriateness and approach of suicide prevention in Cork. Thanks also to the many organisations and groups working in mental health and suicide prevention, who contributed to Connecting for Life Cork, many of whom took part in the work of the Steering Group, Research and Evaluation Group and the Engagement Group. Martin Ryan Resource Officer for Suicide Prevention, Cork Connecting for Life Cork 2017 - 20206 Introduction Too many lives have been lost to suicide in Ireland. While death by suicide will always represent one of the most fundamental challenges to any society, our efforts in the area of prevention evolve and become more effective as we learn more about the things we can do to make a positive difference. Twenty years ago, a national task force was at work in Ireland setting out key recommendations on suicide prevention policy at a national level. Since that time, policy conversations at a national level have filtered down to conversations in everyday settings as suicide and suicide prevention has become a very public concern. One of the most important lessons emerging from the conversations and the experiences of the past twenty years, is that the implementation of effective suicide prevention activities must be guided by local knowledge. As Irish people, one thing in particular that shapes our identity is our sense of place. We identify with our local community and with the county in which we live. The experience of loss from suicide is acutely felt within our communities, and it is within community settings that many of the factors that are protective against suicidal behaviour can be developed and effectively implemented. Connecting for Life, Ireland's National Strategy to Reduce Suicide, 2015-2020 aims 'to support local communities' capacity to prevent and respond to suicidal behaviour' and action 2.1.1 calls for local suicide prevention action plans to be developed. This action plan represents the implementation of action 2.1.1 for Cork City and County. The timing of the development of this plan is important. During the consultation and writing phase of this plan, the people of Cork have been experiencing a deeply-felt concern following a number of reported suicides in both the City and County. This shared concern about the tragic loss of life affecting families, friends and wider communities must never be forgotten as this plan is launched, and the implementation begins. In Connecting for Life Cork, a profile of the City and County is presented in order to describe the context in which this action plan will be implemented. Cork is Ireland's largest county and Cork city is Ireland's second city in terms of population numbers. While the development of a local action plan across a significant geographical area with strong rural and urban cultures can be challenging, this plan has leveraged that diversity by conducting extensive face to face and online consultations. We have learned about the innovative initiatives being undertaken by West Cork Mental Health Services and others, we have been informed by the passionate work of community groups across North, South and East Cork and we have been guided by the internationally renowned National Suicide Research Foundation (NSRF) based in University College Cork. In our consultations we have also spoken to priority groups such as members of the Traveller Community and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transsexual and Intersexual (LGBTI) community, and heard about very difficult experiences amongst young people of having lost friends and family members to suicide in different parts of Cork. It is important to underline that the Cork action plan will build on effective intervention and prevention programmes, the research that has been developed and implemented under the Reach Out Strategy (2005-2014), and in the current strategy Connecting for Life. Connecting for Life Cork is a four-year action plan to help prevent suicide and self-harm in Cork City and County, and considerable collective effort underpins the plan, which encompasses population-level and community actions, targeted initiatives for priority groups, the improved delivery of better services and ongoing monitoring and evaluation. The City and County have been assisted by the ongoing developments of solid and supportive networks of agencies and community based services. The success of this plan will depend on the participation of all these networks. Connecting for Life Cork 2017 - 20207 Cork is a large and diverse county but its people are connected by a strong empathy for one another and a willingness to support each other. The widespread public consultation undertaken to develop the action plan was a rich experience that provides an important platform for the task of implementing the plan. Shining through in the consultation process was the importance of community, and the success of this strategy will depend on resourcing communities across Cork City and County, so that we can build on the many positive initiatives already being undertaken to support people, and act expediently in developing new resources and services. 8 9 1 Context for Suicide Prevention in Ireland and CorkConnecting for Life Cork 2017 - 202010 1.1 National Context 1.1.1 Background to Suicide Prevention The fact that suicide was only decriminalised in Ireland in 1993 says something about a reluctance within the Irish culture to face up to this issue (suicide was decriminalised in Britain in 1961). Since decriminalisation in 1993 there have been significant landmark developments in the area of suicide prevention in Ireland: 1995: A National Task Force on Suicide was established. 1998: the Final Report of National Task Force on Suicide called for the appointment of reg ional r esource officers for suicide prevention. 2005: the national strategy Reach Out: National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention 2005-2014 was published and the HSE National Office for Suicide Prevention was established. 2007: the HSE National Office for Suicide Prevention launched the Your Men tal Health public a wareness campaign. 2015: Connecting for Life: Ireland's National Strategy to Reduce Suicide 2015-2020 was published , calling f or the development and implementation of county-wide suicide prevention plans. In broad terms, the nature of suicide prevention efforts in 2017 reflects the importance of local communities in nurturing a supportive environment, and in responding with compassion and empathy when a death by suicide occurs. 1.1.2 National Policy Context There are a number of national policy documents that are relevant to suicide prevention and mental health and wellbeing. These are described briefly below. Connecting for Life, Ireland's National Strategy to Reduce Suicide 2015 - 2020 Launched in June 2015, Connecting for Life is Ireland's national strategy to reduce suicide 2015-2020. It sets out a vision of an Ireland where fewer lives are lost through suicide, and where communities and individuals are empowered to improve their mental health and wellbeing. It is a cross sectoral strategy with twenty three different lead agencies responsible for actions. Empowering local communities will be key to the success of the strategy. Twenty one local suicide prevention plans, mirroring the national strategy, will be in place by the end of 2017. The strategy follows on from Reach Out: National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention 2005-2014. The National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) was set up in 2005 within the HSE to oversee the implementation, monitoring and coordination of the Reach Out strategy. Since 2005, there has been extensive national and international research in relation to suicidal behaviour and effective interventions, while the range of services available to people in emotional distress have developed in terms of access and quality. Despite this progress since 2005, Ireland's suicide rates remain relatively high and there are particular population groups experiencing significant distress as reflected in rates of both suicide and self-harm. It is likely that the economic recession from 2008 onwards has had an influence on rates of suicidal behaviour. Connecting for Life takes account of the changed landscape in Ireland in relation to mental health and suicide, and it provides a comprehensive, cross-sector, practical plan that can make a positive difference to the lived experience for people from all population groups in Ireland over the coming years. The successful implementation of Connecting for Life will be underpinned by clear and practical local plans such as this plan for Cork.Connecting for Life Cork 2017 - 202011 A Vision for Change: Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy (2006) While suicide prevention is a distinct area of policy, it is important to reference current national mental health policy as it relates to suicide prevention work. The Irish Government's A Vision for Change: Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy asserts as a core principle that 'the mental health needs of the total population should be considered in this policy' (1). A Vision for Change (AVFC) is Ireland's national mental health policy document which sets out a plan for the delivery of mental health services in Ireland from 2006 until 2015. While providing a blueprint for the delivery of mental health services in Ireland, AVFC also claimed a broad approach, acknowledging 'that there is a range of factors which can influence mental health, including physical, psychological, social, cultural and economic' (1). The publication of AVFC followed less than one year after the launch of Reach Out: National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention 2005-2014. The treatment of suicide prevention in AVFC focuses on endorsement of the actions in the Reach Out strategy. Over the past ten years, the broader public mental health issues highlighted in AVFC were largely developed through the NOSP under the banner of suicide prevention. Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Y oung People 2014-2020 This 2014 Irish Government policy framework relating to young people is highly relevant to suicide prevention policy. Of the five Outcomes articulated in this important framework, Outcome 1 states that 'children and young people are active and healthy, with positive physical and mental wellbeing' and aim 1.2 focuses in particular on 'good mental health' with references to increasing mental health literacy. Within Outcome 1 there are references to the mental health of parents as an important influence on the mental health of young people and there is a focus on 'prevention and early intervention' throughout. Healthy Ireland: A Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013 - 2025 Healthy Ireland is a national framework for action to improve the health and wellbeing of the Irish population over the coming generation. The framework places an emphasis on cross-departmental work and getting the most out of existing resources to improve the population's health and wellbeing. Mental health is an integrated theme within the policy and the way in which it is framed reflects the broad public health and more targeted approach adopted in A Vision for Change and in Connecting for Life. The document's high level vision is of 'A Healthy Ireland, where everyone can enjoy physical and mental health and wellbeing to their full potential, where wellbeing is valued and supported at every level of society and is everyone's responsibility' (2). Interestingly, two of the three key performance indicators for 'wellbeing' in Healthy Ireland are a decrease in self-harm and a reduction in our suicide rate.Connecting for Life Cork 2017 - 202012 1.1.3 Suicide and Self-Harm in Ireland Suicide in Ireland Since 1993 when suicide was decriminalised, suicide rates rose steadily from 9.2 per 100,000 population to a high of 13.9 per 100,000 population in 1998. Since 1998, there has been a slight decrease in the overall suicide rate. Based on the most recent year in which we have year of occurrence suicide data, 2014, the suicide rate was 10.5 per 100,000 (486 deaths). When planning suicide prevention activities and developing policy, it is important to take age-related information on suicide mortality into account. In the early 1990s it became apparent that Ireland, along with other western nations, was experiencing high rates of suicide amongst young men. However, men tend to show more presentations than females at an older age, and the most vulnerable age group lies between 15-24 for both males and females (5). Figures 1a and 1b outlines Ireland's Suicide Rate by European Comparison. These figures have been obtained from Eurostat. Figure 1a: Suicide rate per 100,000 for males and females, 2014 Key points include; \u00b7 Ireland's overall suicide rate is not high, by European comparison. \u00b7 In 2014, the total rate of suicide for men and women of all ages in Ireland was 11.03 per 100,000 of the population, the 11th lowest rate of suicide among the 32 countries for which data was recorded by Eurostat. \u00b7 The highest rate was found in Lithuania (31.51 per 100,000 of the population) and the lowest in Cyprus (4.5 per 100,000 of the population). The EU 28 average for 2014 was 11.25 per 100,000. Connecting for Life Cork 2017 - 202013 In Ireland, the suicide rates among young males and females have decreased in recent years. For females and males together, aged 15-19:\u00b7 In 2014 Ireland was the 19th highest rate across the countries studied (4.64 per 100,000). \u00b7 In 2013 Ireland was the 6th highest rate across the countries studied. \u00b7 In 2010 Ireland was the 4th highest rate across the countries studied. \u00b7 The highest rate in 2014 was found in Latvia (16.7 per 100,000) and the lowest in Liechtenstein. \u00b7 The EU 28 average for 2014 was 4.67 per 100,000 amongst this population age-group. Ireland is now below this EU average. In Ireland, the most recent year in which year of occurrence suicide data is available for is 2014. Data for 2015 and 2016 is also available, but this is provisional and subject to future change. Figure 2 below outlines the trend in the national rates of suicide per 100,000 of the population, by gender, from 2001-2016.

Sadly, many deaths by suicide have anecdotally been associated with changing economic circumstances as people have struggled to cope with financial debt, sometimes combined with the loss of work. Homelessness and other indicators of financial distress have become all too familiar across Irish society. In order to investigate the extent of the impact of economic recession on suicide in Ireland, a paper was published in 2015 by Corcoran P , Griffin E, Arensman E, Fitzgerald A, Perry I, reporting on a time-series analysis of suicide and self-harm rates from 2008 to 2012, using data from databases such as the Central Statistics Office and identifying trends in suicide and self harm (7). According to this study, recession and austerity have had an evidently profound impact on suicide rates in Ireland, particularly among men (57% increase by the end of 2012), and in case of self-harm, there was a significant impact on both sexes (7). Furthermore, according to reports by the SSIS 1 (Suicide Support and Information System), 33.1% of people who died by suicide were unemployed, and 41.6% worked in the construction/production sector (8, 9).Connecting for Life Cork 2017 - 202015 Presentations 11,189 204 per 100,000 1 in every 490 had a self-harm actFemale: 15-19 year-olds (718 per 100,000) 1 in every 20-24 year-olds (553 per 100,000) 1 in every 181Rate in 2015 9% higher than 2007 PEAK RATES WERE AMONG YOUNG PEOPLEPersons 8,791 2015 statistics at a glance Mondays and Sundays had the highest number of self-harm presentationsPeak time Women 9pm Men WomenMen 10pmAlmost half of presentations were made between 7pm-3am 7pm3am 2 in every 3 involved overdose 73% received an assessment in the ED 75% received a follow-up recommendation after discharge 13% left the ED without being seen1 in every 3 involved alcohol per 100,000 143 per 100,0002015 2007+9%NATIONAL SELF-HARM REGISTRY IRELAND 4th Floor, Western Gateway Building, University College Cork, Ireland Tel: +353 21 420 5551 Email: info@nsrf.ie 2017 - 202016 Self-Harm in Ireland The term self-harm is used to cover various methods by which people harm themselves non-fatally. Research has shown that people who engage in self-harm are at a greater risk of dying by suicide than those who do not engage in self-harm. Data from the National Self-Harm Registry Ireland (2013) indicates that there were 122,743 self-harm presentations to hospitals in Ireland from 2003 to 2013 and also shows that the rate of use of highly lethal methods of self-harm has increased significantly since 2004, with the strongest increase among those aged 15-19 years of age (6). In 2015, the Registry recorded 11,189 presentations to hospital due to self-harm nationally, involving 8,791 individuals. Taking the population into account, the rate of individuals presenting to hospital following self-harm in 2015 was 204 per 100,000, as illustrated in Figure 3 below. Between 2011 and 2013, there were successive decreases in the self-harm rate. However, the rate in 2015 was still 9% higher than in 2007, the year before the economic recession. In 2015, the national male rate of self-harm was 186 per 100,000, 1% higher than in 2014. The national female rate of self-harm in 2015 was 222 per 100,000, 3% higher than 2014. Since 2007, the male rate has increased by 15%, whereas the female rate is 3% higher than in 2007. Figure 3: Self-harm rate per 100,000 population for males and females, 2002-2015 Source: National Self-Harm Registry Ireland - Annual Report 2015 (10) According to the National Suicide Research Foundation Annual Report (2015), gender differences in the incidence of self-harm vary with age. The female rate was three times higher than the male rate in 10-14 year-olds (178 vs. 45 per 100,000) and 97% higher than the male rate in 15-19 year-olds (718 vs. 364 per 100,000). The female rate of self-harm was again higher than the male rate across the 45-59 year age range. However, in 25-29 year-olds, the male rate was 38% higher than the female rate (400 vs. 289 per 100,000). Since 2009, the Registry has recorded a significantly higher rate of self-harm in men in this age group compared to women (5). Figure 4 shows that the highest rate of self-harm presentations in the Republic of Ireland was in the female 15-19 age group. A steady decline in self-harm presentations is visible with an increase in age. However, men tend to show more presentations than females at an older age, and the most vulnerable age group lies between 15-24 for both males and females (5).Males Females All 2002 167 237 202 2003 177 241 209 2004 170 233 201 2005 167 229 198 2006 160 210 184 2007 162 215 188 2008 180 223 200 2009 197 222 209 2010 211 236 223 2011 205 226 215 2012 195 228 211 2013 182 217 199 2014 185 216 200 2015 186 222 204 150 175 200 225 250 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Males Females All Connecting for Life Cork 2017 - 202017 Figure 4: Rate of self-harm per 100,000 by gender, 2015 Source: National Self-Harm Registry Ireland - Annual Report 2015 (10) Methods of Self-Harm Intentional drug overdose was the most common method of self-harm, involved in 65% of all presentations registered in 2015. Paracetamol was the most common analgesic drug taken, involved in some form in 29% of drug overdoses. Paracetamol-containing medication was used significantly more often by women (34%) than by men (22%). One in five (20%) of overdoses involved an anti-depressant/mood stabiliser (5). In 2015, the number of self-harm presentations to hospital involving drugs increased by 18% from 2014 (following an increase in 2014 by 11%) to 547, which is higher than the level recorded in 2008 (n=462). Attempted hanging was involved in 7% of all self-harm presentations (11% for men and 4% for women). However, between 2007 and 2015, the proportion of self-harm presentations involving hanging increased by 78%. Cutting was the only other common method of self-harm, involved in 27% of all episodes. Alcohol was involved in just under one third of all cases (31%), a slight decrease from 2014. Alcohol was more often involved in male episodes of self-harm than in female episodes (34% vs. 29%). Presentations peaked in the hours around midnight and almost one-third of all presentations occurred on Sundays and Mondays (5). Connecting for Life Cork 2017 - 202018 Treatment In 2015, 75% of patients discharged from the presenting Emergency Department (ED) were provided with an onward referral. For 2015, referrals following discharge included the following: I n 32% of episodes, an out-patient appointment was recommended as a next care step f or the pa tient. R ecommendations to attend their GP for a follow-up appointment were given t o 17% of dischar ged patients. O f those not admitted to the presenting hospital, one in ten was transferred to another hospital f or tr eatment (7% for psychiatric treatment and 3% for medical treatment). O ther services (e.g. psychological services, community-based mental health teams and addic tion ser vices) were recommended in 15% of patients. One quar ter (25%) of patients discharged from the Emergency Department were dischar ged home without a r eferral. Self-harm patients who have consumed alcohol are at an increased risk of leaving the ED without being seen. Linking the Self-Harm Registry Ireland data with the Suicide Support and Information Systems (SSIS) 1 suicide mortality data revealed that self-harm patients were over 42 times more likely to die by suicide than the general population (5). Repeated Self-Harm There were 8,791 individuals treated for 11,189 self-harm episodes in 2015. This shows that more than one in five (2,398, 21.4%) of the presentations in 2015 were due to repeat acts, which is similar 2013-2014. The rate of repetition was broadly similar in men and women (14.5% vs. 14.7%). Repetition varied significantly by age. Approximately 13% of self-harm patients aged less than 19 years re-presented with self-harm in 2015. The proportion who repeated was highest, at 17%, for 25-54 year-olds. An analysis of self-harm rates across the country's 32 HSE Local Health Offices (LHOs) illustrates the variation in the overall rate of repetition in 2015. Dublin South City and Mayo had the highest rates of repetition (20.2%, 19.5% respectively). The lowest rates of repetition were seen in Cork North at 5.6%. 1 SSIS w as developed by the NSRF to provide access to support for the bereaved, while at the same time, obtaining information on risk factors associated with suicide and deaths classified as open verdicts.Connecting for Life Cork 2017 - 202019 1.1.4 Evidence for Suicide Prevention, Knowledge and Awareness In 2014, the Health Research Board investigated the evidence base for effective suicide prevention interventions at the request of the National Office for Suicide Prevention. This incorporated all aspects of suicidal behaviour including self-harm, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and death by suicide. Effective interventions outlined included cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT) and the restriction of access to suicidal means. The work to be carried out in Connecting for Life Cork is informed by the evidence base for effective suicide prevention. In 2016, a systematic review of studies into the effectiveness of suicide prevention interventions was published (11). The interventions assessed in this extensive review can be categorised as follows: Public and doctor education Media strategies Screening Restricting access to the means of suicidal behaviour Treatments Internet or helpline support. There are positive findings reported in studies related to all of these approaches, although the degree of success does vary considerably and findings are specific to the settings and populations in which the research and evaluation was carried out. The development of the actions in Connecting for Life Cork has been informed by the findings reported in this systematic review. Below, some learning is highlighted related to the evidence reported. Separately, it is worth noting evidence from elsewhere (12) which suggests that implementing multi-level suicide prevention initiatives can be particularly effective when implemented as part of a simultaneous programme. Education of the General Public, Health Professionals and Community Facilitators A high number of studies have reported positive results in relation to the education of GPs and community facilitators and subsequent increases in referral and treatment levels for depression. The implementation of education and awareness actions in Cork will be informed by positively evaluated campaign outcomes. Education in Schools Early intervention with regard to promoting positive mental health and reducing suicide is essential. Therefore, the focus for Connecting for Life in schools is to: Support schools to develop a whole school approach to mental health promotion guided by all the HSE and Department of Education and Skills (DES) support guidelines, policies and circulars. Guide schools in developing as a Health Promoting School guided by all the HSE and DES support guidelines, policies and circulars. Encourage schools to avail of DES and HSE training in relation to Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) and mental health. While many schools-based programmes have not been evaluated, some high quality studies have been published in recent years indicating positive improvements in knowledge and attitudes towards suicide.Connecting for Life Cork 2017 - 202020 The European-wide SEYLE (Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe Study), which included an Irish sample (from Cork and Kerry), reported a significant reduction in both suicide attempts and severe suicide ideation among students assigned to the 'Youth Aware of Mental Health Programme' (YAM) compared with a control group (13). Connecting for Life Cork will draw on existing research evidence to guide the development and advancement of a mental health in schools agenda. New and existing programmes such as DBT, Steps A, YAM, Friends for Life and Mindout will require ongoing evaluation. Media Strategies Two-way effects have been reported in relation to media coverage of suicide. Graphic and sensationalist coverage can have negative impacts, especially on vulnerable populations. Positive reporting can be associated with positive impacts on public mental health and the importance of reasonable media reporting around suspected suicide clusters is important. The effectiveness of guidelines on responsible reporting of suicide in the media is greatly enhanced if the media are directly and actively involved in developing the guidelines. Restricting Access to Means of Suicidal Behaviour The likely success of strategies involving the restriction of access to suicide methods depend on the nature of the methods commonly used in a particular setting. While there is strong evidence for an overall reduction in suicide rates by restricting access to firearms, this method is relatively uncommon in Ireland. The most common method of suicide in Ireland is hanging, followed by drowning. There is some strong evidence of the efficacy of erecting barriers at sites where people jump, including at bridges. In summary, the review of the literature indicated that the following interventions are effective or show promise: P romote public awareness with regard to issues of mental wellbeing, suicidal behaviour , the c onsequences of stress and effective crisis management. Enable ear ly identification, assessment, treatment and referral to professional car e of people vulner able to suicidal behaviour. M aintain a comprehensive training programme for identified first responders and fron tline healthcar e staff (e.g. Garda\u00ed, emergency department staff, educators, mental health professionals). P romote responsible reporting of suicidal behaviour by media outlets. P romote increased access to comprehensive services, including mental health servic es and emer gency departments, for those vulnerable to, or affected by, suicidal behaviour. P rovide supportive and rehabilitative services to people affected by suicide. Suppor t the provision of therapeutic approaches such as dialectal behaviour therapy t o defined popula tion groups e.g. those who repeatedly self-harm. R educe the availability, accessibility and attractiveness of the means for suicidal behaviour. Suppor t the establishment of an integrated data-collection system, which serves to identify at r isk g roups, individuals and situations. A llow screening for suicide risk among groups vulnerable to suicide. I mprove healthcare services targeting people vulnerable to suicide, including improvemen ts in inpa tient and outpatient aftercare available to people who have attempted suicide. Suppor t a whole-school approach to mental health promotion. Suppor ting the provision of Safe TALK and ASIST training to the general public/community groups.Connecting for Life Cork 2017 - 202021 1.2 Local Context in Cork City and County 1.2.1 Local Policy Context Action 2.1.1 of the Connecting for Life seeks to align local suicide prevention plans with local economic and community plans (LECPs). The development of LECPs has been described as \"a process that seeks to enhance the delivery of national social and economic policy at the local level\" . Both Cork County Council and Cork City Council published plans in 2016. These plans provide in-depth analysis and description of the physical, economic and social environment in Cork. According to the Cork County LECP , Cork is essentially a city-based region with a population of around 500,000 people, 80% of whom live within a 45-minute car journey from the city. The remaining 20% maintain an important, but less pronounced connection with the urban core of Cork City. The county has significant natural assets including Cork harbour, extensive agricultural lands and an extensive coastline of over 1,094km. With the second-longest coastline of any county of Ireland, Cork has a proud history of maritime and coastline activities, including regattas, maritime festivals and the annual Lee swim. The Cork County LECP places particular emphasis on the importance of community, and in this way it is closely aligned to Connecting for Life Cork. The County Plan describes how communities are \"at the heart of our society. They are the places where we live and often work, where our families are, where our friends are, and, largely where we interact with life\" (6). Based on a 2015 public survey which informed the County LECP , Cork is generally viewed as a great place to live, and the Cork County Quality of Life Survey 2015 reports that 92% of respondents believe Cork \"is a great place to live\" and 88% reported \"a sense of community in their neighbourhoods\" . Key LECP recommendations aligned to Connecting for Life Cork include plans \"to develop a programme of actions to develop and facilitate enhanced civic and community engagement\" (6). Perhaps more significantly, the County Plan also aims \"by 2018, building on existing collaborative initiatives, to develop a programme of actions to guide inter-agency action in improving health and wellbeing, physical and mental, of residents\" (6). While the Cork County LECP has a strong focus on enhancing community, in keeping with Strategic Goal 2 of Connecting for Life nationally, the Cork City LECP has actions addressing suicide prevention. A specific objective of the city plan is \"to increase suicide awareness in Cork city\" (6) with accompanying actions including: I mplement the relevant actions set out in Connecting for Life Cork. T o continue to work in partnership with other statutory agencies, voluntary and communit y par tners to enhance the existing facilitation of Suicide Prevention Education and Tr aining pr ogrammes to empower the people of Cork to become more alert to the signs of suicide risk. T o continue in the provision of support and information to individuals and communities affect ed b y suicide. T o build awareness of the link between alcohol and drug misuse and increased suicidal beha viour using a men tal health toolkit. A further action in the City LECP Plan, under the 'Safe and Green City' High Level Goal is to \"Develop a themed approach to suicide and safety in the community\" . This action aligns closely with actions set out in Connecting for Life nationally related to highly visible public information on mental health and crisis supports across both the City and County, particularly those that can be identified as possible high risk locations.Connecting for Life Cork 2017 - 202022 In addition to the LECPs for Cork City and County, implementation of this action plan will be aligned with other relevant local policy such as the Cork and Kerry Alcohol Strategy 2016-2018, Time for Change. As this strategy notes, alcohol is involved in around half of all suicides in Ireland and over one- third of hospital presentations to hospital following self-harm. Given the strong focus on education and awareness in both the Time for Change and Connecting for Life Cork, it is important that public messaging is coordinated and consistent. More broadly, looking at issues related to drugs and suicidal behaviour in Cork, Connecting for Life Cork also resonates with the Cork Local Drug and Alcohol Task Force Strategic Plan, 2015-2017. Actions within the plan range from education in school settings to targeting the mental health impact of the misuse of benzodiazepines, which are strongly associated with acts of self-harm. The importance of collaboration between the HSE and the Cork Local Drug and Alcohol Task Force (CLDATF) in the coming years is clear in light of both Time to Change and the CLDATF Strategic Plan. The Cork Children & Young People Services Committee (CYPSC) aims to improve outcomes for children and young people in coordination with the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures framework. The purpose of CYPSC in this framework is to bring all key agencies together in a collaborative effort to improve outcomes for children and young people. This involves both statutory and community and voluntary groups. Working groups have been created to deal with specific areas relevant to improving outcomes for children and young people in relation to mental health, drugs and alcohol, children with disabilities, youth participation and research and information. 1.2.2 Suicide, Self-Harm and Mental Health in Cork City and County Suicide in Cork City and County Communities are well placed to nurture supportive living environments and to respond with compassion and empathy when a suicide happens. Suicide and efforts to prevent it have become very local concerns. Through community conversations, and based on the experience of a number of deaths by suicide, certain villages and towns in Cork have been described as areas known to have a relatively high rate of suicide in recent years. There is no doubt that suicide clusters occur in Irish communities and social contagion may play a role in this happening, and evidence of suicide clusters in Cork City and County in particular has been reported by the NSRF (8, 9). The most important thing to do in relation to possible suicide clusters is to respond in a planned, caring and supportive manner by routinely providing support to bereaved individuals, families and communities. The Central Statistics Office does not routinely report on suicide rates in small geographical areas, e.g. by town or village, but data are available by County and City. Figure 5 outlines the three-year moving average rate of suicide per 100,000 of the population in Cork City, County and Ireland. Connecting for Life Cork 2017 - 202023 Figure 5: Rates of suicide per 100,000 population for Cork and Ireland, 3-year moving averages (2004-2016*) *Rates for 2015 and 2016 are provisional and subject to change Source: Central Statistics Office (4) Self-Harm in Cork City and County For the period from 1 January to 31 December 2015, the National Self-Harm Registry recorded 11,189 self-harm presentations to hospital that were made by 8,791 individuals nationally. In the Cork area, there were 999 individuals treated for 1195 self-harm episodes in 2015. This implies that 16% (n=198) of presentations were due to repeat acts. Based on persons, the rate of repetition was 13%, and similar for men and women (11% and 14%, respectively). In 2015, high rates of self-harm for both men and women were seen in Cork City, where the male rate was 1.3 times higher than the national average and the female rate was 30% higher (10). As Table 1 indicates, in 2015, the rate of persons presenting to hospital in Cork North following self- harm was 150 and 186 per 100,000 for males and females respectively. The rate of persons presenting to hospital in Cork North Lee following self-harm was 255 and 232 per 100,000 population for males and females in respectively. In Cork South Lee, the rate of persons presenting following self-harm was 204 and 163 per 100,000 for males and females respectively. The rate of persons presenting to hospital in Cork West following self-harm was 136 and 110 per 100,000 for males and females respectively (10).

Services are delivered through hospitals, day centres and in people's homes. In general, access to mental health services is dependent on referral from primary care (usually a GP). It's important to note that anyone in crisis can self-refer to 24/7 psychiatric services in hospital emergency departments. Services, supports and training programmes include: Community Training in Suicide Prevention In an effort to build communities' skills, resilience and confidence in responding to suicide risk, the provision of free suicide awareness/prevention training to communities is one of the HSE's sustaining initiatives. Between 2010 and 2016, the HSE and training partners Breaking the Silence, Cork Mental Health Foundation, Tusla and other community partners have delivered training programmes to 9,647 people. These training programmes include SafeTALK, a half day suicide alertness programme in which participants learn how to provide practical help to people with thoughts of suicide. SafeTALK is delivered throughout the county in local communities, often in partnership with the community and voluntary sector. SafeTALK is the main training programme delivered in Cork by the HSE and its partners, and accounts for 90% of the suicide training output for Cork. For more information on the safeTALK training programmes available, email SP .enquiries@hse.ieOther training programmes include ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training). This is a two- day course focused on suicide first-aid. It is suitable for those with direct access to the public in terms of service provision in the areas of health, justice, education, youth work and family support such as health workers, teachers, community workers, Garda\u00ed and youth workers. It is often delivered as a follow-on from SafeTALK. Understanding Self-Harm is a one-day course which aims to build awareness of self-harm issues. It is offered by HSE staff to a range of professionals eg Tusla, staff, teachers and youth and community workers. STORM Skills Training is a two to six day training course delivered by trained staff. STORM provides skills based training in suicide prevention, postvention and self-harm for mental health service staff. Table 2a. Service Provision 2010-2016 Total Number of 202025 Table 2b.

Photograph is courtesy of ReachOut.com31 32 2 How the Action Plan was DevelopedConnecting for Life Cork 2017 - 202033 2.1 Approach An evidence-based approach ensures that Connecting for Life Cork will implement realistic objectives that reflect local need in the most cost-effective manner. To support this, and in line with the national strategy, broad engagement with the community was a crucial aspect of the development, as was identifying groups vulnerable to suicidal behaviour and the factors that put them at risk. The consultation process ensured that the goals of this action plan align with the needs of the people of Cork. The Cork Suicide Prevention Planning Group (SPPG) was established with the aim of directly contributing to the preparation of Connecting for Life Cork ensuring a local response that will reduce the numbers of suicide deaths and self-harm incidents in Cork. The aims of the SPPG were: T o facilitate inter-sectoral and multi-agency working and collaboration in the preven tion of suicide and suicidal beha viour and in the promotion of health and wellbeing in Cork across the statutory , v oluntary and community sectors. T o create an awareness and understanding of services and service delivery within Cork f or suicide pr evention and mental health promotion. T o develop an integrated action plan to support the prevention of suicide and self-har m and the pr omotion of positive mental health in Cork. T o agree the required Connecting for Life Cork Working Groups and their scope. T o set a timeframe for the development of action plan. T o make recommendations regarding implementation of Connecting for Life Cork. Two additional working groups were set up: T he Engagement Working Group (EWG): to facilitate broad engagement and participa tion, and ensur e that stakeholders in the county, particularly in the community and voluntary sect or had an oppor tunity to be involved . T he Information and Research Working Group (IRWG): to lead on the information and resear ch elemen ts of Connecting for Life Cork, identify existing suicide prevention services and suppor ts in C ork, to determine the research and data gaps and any requirement for primary research. The National Office for Suicide Prevention also supported the approach by ensuring that the development of the Connecting for Life Cork remained consistent with the goals and actions outlined in Connecting for Life. Connecting for Life Cork 2017 - 202034 2.2 Consultation Process The county wide consultation was one of the most important elements in preparing Connecting for Life Cork. Every effort was made to enable the general public, Community and Voluntary organisations, statutory and non-statutory agencies and HSE staff to share their thoughts. The various elements of the consultation process are outlined below. 2.2.1 Public Meetings During September and October 2016 public meetings were hosted by the Resource Officer for Suicide Prevention, providing people with an opportunity to have a say in developing Connecting for Life Cork. A total of 356 participants attended the meetings and over 700 comments and suggestions were captured and entered into a database for analysis. 2.2.2 Online Surveys To complement the public consultation meetings, three online surveys were conducted to get the views of the general public, young people and service providers. A total of 41 people responded to the general public survey, nine responded to the young people's survey, and 69 services responded to the service provider's survey. This survey of service providers aimed to determine the nature and range of service provision in the county, and the general public and young people's surveys asked about suicide prevention priorities. General Public Survey There were more responses elicited from people living in Cork county when compared to the city (68% and 32%), while more females (73%) replied than males. Sixty one percent of respondents were aged between 26 and 45 years old. The survey used both open-ended and structured questions. Special Support Groups/Individual Meetings Over the course of the months of September /November 2016 we also embarked on meeting Individuals and key groups that have been directly affected by suicide within their own families and communities' . This gave a real insight into the real impact of a death and what would work in terms of real support and guidance through this difficult time.Connecting for Life Cork 2017 - 202035 \"Holistic approach by schools, classes, programmes run in schools\" Submission from secondary school students\"Teach how to manage emotions, peer support/ buddy system, senior cycle partnered with junior cycle students, student councils\" Submission from secondary school students\"Creation of a safe 'space' to speak / non judgement is important\" Submission from secondary school students \"Positive mental health charter within all schools\" Submission from secondary school studentsY oung Person's Survey Only nine young people completed the online survey despite promotion of the link at public meetings and through youth organisations in the city and county. To ensure the voice of young people was taken into account, a separate youth consultation was conducted in Cork City Hall. This consultation was hosted by ReachOut.com, a youth mental health service, and was attended by over 40 young people from organisations such as The Life Centre, Foroige, Cloyne Diocesan Youth Services, Youth Work Ireland Cork and Bishopstown Community School. A further school consultation, led by the Lord Mayor of Cork, was held in the City Hall where young people had the opportunity to feed back their thoughts and views of suicide and self-harm prevention in their schools. This was supported by community-based services, HSE CHO Mental Health CAMHS teams and other relevant stakeholders. 2.2.3 Focus Groups With the support of community based organisations, a number of focus groups were held with priority groups from the county. The overall aim was to ensure that the voices of as many people as possible were listened to in developing the plan: Traveller Community, Traveller Health Unit HSE Social inclusion Homeless Organisations Youth services across the City and County Farming Community (IFA) LGBTI Staff and residents in Direct Provision Centres Family Members and those affected by suicide The overall aim was to ensure that we have th widest consultation process across all groups. \"Develop an information mental health resource toolkit, to support key groups working directly with the public\".

To inform Connecting for Life, the Central Statistics Office suicide statistics and data from the National Self-Harm Registry of Ireland, as well as research on the incidence of suicide in various population groups were examined to profile the groups most vulnerable to suicide in Ireland. Nationally, priority groups identified in Connecting for Life include the following: P eople experiencing mental health difficulty P eople with drug or alcohol problems M embers of the Traveller community M embers of the LGBTI community There are other groups with potentially increased risk of suicidal behaviour where the research evidence is either less consistent or limited. These include: A sylum Seekers R efugees P risoners M igrants S ex Workers P eople with chronic illness or disability Homeless y outh and adults F urther research is required for these groups. There is significant overlap between many of the groups, and it is important to note that even within a group where there is increased risk only a minority will engage in suicidal behaviour. Over the lifetime of Connecting for Life, other population groups may emerge as particularly vulnerable to suicide. This list of priority groups will be reviewed regularly based on the most up to date evidence. 3.2 Local Priority Groups Through the public consultation process and in the targeted focus groups, some specific needs in relation to priority groups have been identified in Cork. On a local level, those most at risk of suicide and self-harm are as follows: M embers of the Traveller Community M embers of the LGBTI Community. P eople with existing mental health conditions Y oung people coping with life transitions P eople who misuse drugs or alcohol The Cork City Profile, 2014 reports that there were an estimated 789 Travellers living in Cork City in 2011, which comprised 0.7% of the overall population. The Cork City Profile goes on to report that 'Travellers are significantly more at risk of a variety of health problems including lower life expectancy and suicide' . While the consultation meeting with Cork Travellers highlighted issues around acculturation and specific risks associated with Traveller men, there are also unique stresses on Traveller women. These are both addressed in Connecting for Life Cork. Connecting for Life Cork 2017 - 202039 There are an estimated 12,000 LGBTI people in Cork City according to the aforementioned 'Cork City Profile' report and this population has been identified as being discriminated against in relation to employment, education, accommodation, health and personal safety (5). This covers a significant percentage of the Cork City population, and it is important that these individuals are also considered as a priority group in relation to the discrimination factors outlined. As seen with the identified national priority groups, there is also the potential for an overlap among individuals or families to be categorised within multiple priority groups i.e. a young member of the LGBTI community who is struggling to cope with life transitions that come with his/her age.

The importance of effective social inclusion relates to accessibility of support and services for priority groups and those populations considered with a minority stance in the wider Cork community. Due to the risk of isolation of these groups, it is crucial that social inclusion is monitored to allow for the effective provision of services and care to priority groups. Connecting for Life Cork aims to reach out to all population groups across Cork City and County. Social inclusion involves provision of targeted interventions for people from traditionally marginalised groups who experience health inequalities, have difficulties accessing services and present with multiple, complex health and support needs. Vulnerable people and communities falling within the remit of Social Inclusion include Irish Travellers and Roma, asylum seekers and refugees and LGBTI people. Issues of addiction, substance misuse, homelessness and domestic, sexual and gender based violence are overarching themes within the work of HSE Social Inclusion. The cross cutting nature of social inclusion, with intersection of a range of issues across service user groups demands a partnership approach across statutory and voluntary sectors where responses are flexible, sophisticated, coordinated and aimed at eventual integration of service users into mainstream services where possible. At the same time, social inclusion works with mainstream services towards assuring accessibility to disadvantaged service users. There is a strong link between poverty, socio-economic status and health. Mental and physical health problems can be both a cause and consequence of homelessness and social deprivation. Excluded and disadvantaged groups within the population carry a disproportionate burden of mental and physical ill-health and disability, with consequent high health service use and health (particularly mental health) and social care costs. Connecting for Life Cork 2017 - 202041 3.3 National Risk Factors There is a limit to the amount of information that is routinely collected about the circumstances of people who take their own life, or for any cause of death. What is known about patterns of death in Ireland is generally based on reports from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and this information is confined to basic demographics such as age, gender, county of death, and cause of death. For a more in-depth understanding of the factors associated with death by suicide once-off or standalone research studies such as the Suicide Support and Information System (SSIS) operated by the National Suicide Research Foundation is used. The First Report of the Suicide Support and Information System (8), conducted over the time period September 2008 to March 2011, ascertained 178 cases of suicide and 12 open verdicts (total 190). It revealed the following information which shines a light on risk characteristics in Ireland generally: Risk Characteristics Previous suicidal behaviour 45% had a hist ory of self-harm. Of those, 52% had engaged in self harm 12 months prior to suicide , 24% less than a w eek, and 12% less than a day. Psychiatric diagnosis A mong those who had received a psychiatric assessment (31.4%), 61.1% were diag nosed with mood disor der followed by anxiety disorder (12.9%). Drugs and alcohol 51.7% had abused alc ohol and/or drugs in the year prior to death, the majority abusing alc ohol (78.1%). C ontact with health services I n the year prior to death, 81% had been in contact with their GP or a mental health service . A mong those who had been in contact with the GP , the majorit y (67.4%) had done so 4 times or mor e during the year prior to death. The Second SSIS Report (9) presented results and information on 307 consecutive cases of suicide in Cork City and County between September 2008 and June 2012 and revealed further information, including the following: Employment and occupation 40.6% w ere in paid employment, 33.1 % were unemployed, 11.4% were retired, 6.8% wer e fulltime studen ts, 5.0% had a long term disability and 3.1% were homemakers. M ore than two fifths (41.6%) had worked in the construction/production sector, followed b y the ag ricultural sector (13.2%), sales/business development (8.9%), students educa tion sector (3.9%). Physical illness O ut of 165 cases for which this variable was known, 57% of cases had a physical illness. A wide r ange of illnesses was represented (including cancer, chronic back pain, chr onic neck pain and c oronary heart problems). O f those who had a physical illness prior to death, 38% were in physical pain in the year prior t o dea th and 16.5% had reduced physical capabilities in the month prior to death.Connecting for Life Cork 2017 - 202042 Table 3: Individual, socio-cultural and situational risk factors Individual Socio-cultural Situational P revious suicide attempt M ental health problem A lcohol or drug misuse Hopelessness S ense of isolation Lack of social suppor t A ggressive tendencies I mpulsivity H istory of trauma or abuse A cute emotional distress M ajor physical or chronic illnesses and chronic pain F amily history of suicide Neur obiological factorsS tigma associated with help- seeking behaviour Bar riers to accessing health care, mental health servicesand substance abuse treatment C ertain cultural and religious beliefs (e.g. the belief thatsuicide is a noble resolution ofa personal dilemma) Exposur e to suicidal behaviour, e.g. through the media, andinfluence of others who havedied by suicide Job and financial losses R elational or social losses Easy ac cess to lethal means L ocal clusters of suicide that have a contagious influence S tressful life events A review of Irish studies by the NSRF also found specific risk factors for different populations such as young people, unemployed people and marginalised groups like men living in rural communities, members of the Traveller Community and survivors of institutional sex abuse. The complex interplay of factors, which seem to exacerbate the risk for individuals, is not yet fully understood. 3.4 Local Risk Factors The risk factors identified during the consultation process in Cork reflected and added to those identified by research and listed above. The risk factors listed as particularly significant to life in Cork are shown in Table 3 below were: Table 4: Individual, socio-cultural and situational risk factors for Cork Individual Socio-cultural Situational M ental health problem A lcohol or drug misuse S ense of rural isolation Lack of social in teraction and support A cute emotional distress Discr imination and isolation due to identity or sexualityS tigma associated with help- seeking behaviour Bar riers to accessing health care, mental health servicesand substance abusetreatment Exposur e to suicidal behaviour, e.g. through themedia, and influence of otherswho have died by suicide Job and financial losses R elational or social losses Easy ac cess to lethal means L ocal clusters of suicide that have a contagious influence S tressful life and/or transitional eventsConnecting for Life Cork 2017 - 202043 3.4 National Protective Factors Equally as important as reducing risk factors in suicide prevention attention needs to be given to strengthening interventions that are known to increase resilience and protect against suicidal behaviour. Research conducted by the World Health Organisation; Preventing Suicide, A Global Imperative (2014) highlights three key themes that act as protective factors against the risk of suicide: S trong personal relationships T he existence of religious or spiritual belief s and Lif estyle practice of positive coping strategies and wellbeing. Strong Personal Relationships Suicidal behaviour increases when people experience relationship conflict, loss or discord. Equally, maintaining healthy close relationships can increase individual resilience and act as a protective factor against the risk of suicide. The individual's closest social circle - partners, family members, peers, friends and significant others - have the most influence and can be supportive in times of crisis. In particular, resilience gained from this support mitigates the suicide risk associated with childhood trauma. Relationships are especially protective for adolescents and the elderly, who have a higher level of dependency. Religious or Spiritual Beliefs Faith itself may be a protective factor since it typically provides a structured belief system and can advocate for behaviour that can be considered physically and mentally beneficial. Many religious and cultural beliefs and behaviours may also contribute towards stigma related to suicide due to their moral stances on suicide, which can discourage help-seeking behaviours. The protective value of religion and spirituality may occur from providing access to a socially cohesive and supportive community with a shared set of values. Many religious groups also prohibit suicide risk factors such as alcohol use. While religion and spiritual beliefs may offer some protection against suicide, this depends on specific cultural and contextual practices and interpretations. Lifestyle Practice of Positive Coping Strategies and Wellbeing Personal wellbeing and effective positive coping strategies protect against suicide. An optimistic outlook, emotional stability and a developed self-identity assist in coping with life's complications. Good self-esteem, self-efficacy and effective problem solving-skills, which include the ability to seek help when needed, can mitigate the impact of stressors and childhood adversities. Willingness to seek help for mental health problems may in particular be determined by personal attitudes. Due to the fact that mental health problems are widely stigmatised, people (and especially males) may be reluctant to seek help. Those who are unlikely to seek help can compound their mental health problems, increasing the risk of suicide that may otherwise have been prevented through early intervention. Healthy lifestyle choices which promote mental and physical wellbeing include regular exercise and sport, sleeping well, a healthy diet, consideration of the impact on health of alcohol and drugs, talking about problems, healthy relationships and social contact and effective management of stress. More practically, mental health promotion activities which have demonstrated promise at both individual and population levels are reflected in the national #littlethings public mental health campaign. Specifically, the following #littlethings are currently being promoted through an integrated public awareness campaign as a whole population initiative to promote protective factors in suicide prevention:Connecting for Life Cork 2017 - 202044 K eeping active - being active every day, something as simple as a walk is proven to have a positiv e impac t on your mood.

Irish Life has committed \u20ac1million to the programme over an initial three-year period. Created in 2013, with the support of the HSE, National Office for Suicide Prevention, Irish Life and Healthy Ireland, the intention of the HCP is that every GAA club will become a hub for health and wellbeing. Each participating club is supported in how best to make their club more health-enhancing, covering a variety of topics including, physical activity; emotional wellbeing; health screening; healthy eating; drug, alcohol, and gambling education; anti-smoking; youth and community development, alongside providing activities for older members of the community. The initial phase of 18 clubs underwent evaluation and research by Waterford's IT, which concluded that the Healthy Clubs Project is a viable model to deliver these positive messages. Ultimately, the project aims to involve every GAA club in the country, thus enhancing the long term health of every community. Cork City Football Club (CCFC) Cork City Football Club is a leading League of Ireland football team where home games can attract over 7,500 people. The club actively engages at a community level to support vulnerable groups in the City, linking with national initiatives such as the #littlethings campaign and the Green Ribbon campaign. Green Ribbon The Green Ribbon campaign, rolled out by See Change, the National Stigma Reduction Partnership, aims to get people to speak openly about mental health annually during the month of May. Connecting for Life Cork 2017 - 202047 3.5 Local Protective Factors Feedback during the Cork consultation, which reflects both the professional and personal experience of those participating, listed local protective factors relevant to the Cork community. Although related to the aforementioned national factors listed above, the protective factors listed below are more specific to the community of Cork. Physical Activity The importance of a healthy lifestyle was identified as a local protective factor, and the significant role it plays in maintaining good health. However the need for group based activities to encourage participation and overcome the challenges of isolation in order to access activities was deemed significant. Social Interaction Inter-personal relationships and social circles are more difficult to maintain while living in rural isolation, and the importance of support from others becomes amplified as a result. Attending social events, having social spaces to frequent and having access to everyday social interactions is therefore vitally important for mental health and wellbeing. As identified nationally, adolescents and the elderly have a higher level of dependency on social interaction, and as a result, relationships are especially protective. However, in rural settings these priority groups in Cork are often the least likely to have access to social spaces and means of transport to attend social events in local towns. The importance of opportunities for social interaction as a protective factor in Cork cannot be understated. Building Resilience The feedback from the Cork consultation identified the need to build resilience for those vulnerable to self-harm and suicide. Self-esteem and coping skills among young people, and overcoming stigma to seek help for people of all ages were constant themes. Education, awareness and training will form a key part of Connecting for Life Cork, focusing on positive mental health and wellbeing as a protective factor. 48 49 4 Connecting for Life Cork Strategic Goals, Objectives and ActionsConnecting for Life Cork 2017 - 202050 Connecting for Life Cork Strategic Goals Connecting for Life Cork is a three year local action plan developed in response to Connecting for Life, Ireland's National Strategy to Reduce Suicide 2015-2020. The purpose of Connecting for Life Cork is to support and deliver on national objectives at a local level in County Cork, meeting local needs. The action plan is aligned to the Vision, Goals, Objectives and Actions in the national strategy and its achievements will be evaluated and measured against implementing local actions that are aligned to the national strategic goals, objectives and actions. VISION A County Cork where fewer lives are lost through suicide, and where communities and individuals are empowered to improve their mental health and wellbeing GOALS To improve the understanding of, and attitudes to, suicidal behaviour, mental health and wellbeing To support local communities' capacity to prevent and respond to suicidal behaviour To target approaches to reduce suicidal behaviour and improve mental health among priority groups To enhance accessibility, consistency and care pathways of services to people vulnerable to suicidal behaviour To ensure safe and high quality services for people vulnerable to suicide To reduce and restrict access to means of suicidal behaviour Improve surveillance, evaluation and high quality research relating to suicidal behaviour OUTCOMES Reduced suicide rate in the whole population and amongst specified priority groups Reduced rate of presentations of self-harm in the whole population and amongst specified priority groupsConnecting for Life Cork 2017 - 202051 National Strategic Goal 1: To improve the understanding of, and attitudes to, suicidal behaviour, mental health and wellbeing. The recent past has seen an increase in public awareness and activity across Cork on the issue of mental health and wellbeing generally, and suicide specifically. Supported by the HSE, many support services, both statutory and voluntary, have developed in the county in response to this increased awareness. Despite the increased awareness and activity, feedback suggests that most people are still hesitant to discuss mental health, that significant stigma still exists around mental ill-health, and that there remains a general lack of awareness of the supports and services available. Many of the actions in Strategic Goal One are focused on having a significant impact and bringing about change in these areas. Co-ordination is key to being more effective at addressing this, and therefore forms a central part of the actions under this goal.

The national strategy recognises the vital role of the community and voluntary sector in effecting change at a local level. Cork has one of the most active community and voluntary sectors in the country, with a broad range of services and supports available in both formal and informal settings. Co-ordination and consistency, whether in relation to information provision, signposting or service delivery, were common themes of the county wide consultation, and therefore inform the actions for this goal. Training and up skilling, and the provision of common quality assurance standards will be vital in terms of achieving consistency Goal 2: To support local communities' capacity to prevent and respond to suicidal behaviour.

As outlined previously, national and international research, supported by local feedback, identifies priority groups for whom the risk of suicide and self-harm is greater. Local risk factors help to identify local priority groups, and therefore necessitate the need for targeted local actions to meet local needs. Rural isolation is a compounding factor for all priority groups in Cork, and will be one of the biggest challenges for Connecting for Life Cork, therefore community based accessible information, signposting, training and service delivery will be instrumental to its success. Beyond this, the targeted actions for under this goal will address the needs of the priority groups identified during the consultation.

People vulnerable to suicidal behaviour require easy access to a range of supports, appropriate to their needs and with an approach that shows empathy and sensitivity. Given the spectrum of needs, from disclosure or distress to psychotherapeutic interventions and long term care, transfers and referrals among services is often likely and necessary. Clear and easy navigation between health services and other statutory services or community and voluntary services is needed. A co-ordinated, consistent and integrated approach is a vital component of effective care pathways to people vulnerable to suicidal behaviour.

Restricting access to means has consistently proven to be an effective method of prevention. For a local action plan, safety improvements at key locations where attempted suicides are known to frequently occur, or have been completed can have significant impact. Local interventions form the basis for actions under this goal. Goal 6: To reduce and restrict access to means of suicidal behaviour. National ObjectiveNational Action Local ActionLead OrganisationKey Partners 6.2 Reduce access to highly lethal methods used in suicidal behaviour6.2.1 Local Authorities will be requested to consider, develop and implement measures where practical to restrict access to identified locations and settings where people are at risk of engaging in suicidal behaviour, and assist generally in reducing risk factors in public locations. 6.2.1(a) Set up a Rivers sub group of key stakeholders to learn from national and international practice to prevent access to named locations of concern.Cork City Council, Cork County Council HSE MH, NSRF 6.2.1(b) Conduct an audit to determine high risk locations for incidents of suicide in the city, river and coastlines.

The development of responsive suicide prevention services is dependent on the availability of data on the types of services and interventions that are effective in preventing or reducing suicidal behaviour. This includes research into the most vulnerable groups, trends in suicidal behaviour and key risk and protective factors. Locally generated research comparing like for like in terms of demographics and geography would prove beneficial for Cork.

This will be led by the Mental Health team of the HSE Community Health Organisation Cork, Kerry, supported by the HSE Resource Officers for Suicide Prevention. Annual work plans will be prepared, the first of which will be agreed in Quarter Three of 2017. The action plans will highlight the priorities for the year from the four year plan. From 2018, the annual work plans will report on progress in implementing actions in the previous calendar year. The work plans for 2018, 2019 and 2020 will be finalised by January 31 st each year. There are a range of important functions that will operate in parallel in the implementation of Connecting for Life Cork, as we will work with the LCDC and CYPSC local plans. The Implementation Steering Group will appoint smaller sub-groups with expertise, experience and capacity to deliver on their assigned action. 5.1.1 Implementation Steering Group The development of a cross-sectoral Implementation Steering Group (ISG) supported by six working groups is outlined above. Each working group will be responsible for the management of their respective Connecting for Life Cork actions, and implementing them within the agreed timeframe and meeting the required quality parameters. This will ensure a focused approach to implementing the action plan with specific annual outputs and outcomes. Aligned to this, annual work plans will be developed and agreed upon by each working group. These work plans will focus contributions from key agencies and highlight the priority actions for each year. The Chair of each working group will sit on the ISG. Connecting for Life Cork is a live, dynamic and flexible action plan and the ISG will ensure that account is taken of any emerging needs and trends in the county throughout the life of the plan. The implementation structures are flexible and open to change in order to accommodate these needs.

Day to day co-ordination of the action plan and delivery will be under the direction of the HSE Resource Officers for Suicide Prevention in Cork. Resources will be sought for an additional supports for the implementation of the Connecting for Life Cork where needed. 5.1.2 Monitoring and Evaluation The ISG will be responsible for the implementation of the Connecting for Life Cork. Progress and issues will be reported to the ISG by the Chairs of each individual working group. The National Office for Suicide Prevention has developed a national monitoring and evaluating system for the local action plans, and this will inform the continuous progress monitoring and evaluation of Connecting for Life Cork. In addition, an internal annual review and evaluation will be conducted by the Connecting for Life Cork ISG. 5.1.3 Communicating Connecting for Life Cork Communications relating to the implementation of Connecting for Life Cork will be the responsibility of the ISG, supported by the NOSP and HSE Communications where required. Clear communication between the many stakeholders involved in this action plan is vital. To coordinate and assist effective communications between stakeholders, a Communications Plan will be developed to ensure appropriate management. 5.1.4 Resourcing Connecting for Life Cork Implementing the multi-faceted actions outlined in Connecting for Life Cork will involve the use of existing resources and an improved level of cooperation within Cork HSE services, statutory and non-statutory agencies and the Community and Voluntary sector, thus supporting the whole community approach. Overall implementation is the responsibility of many organisations, and during the development stages of this action plan, agreement was reached between these organisations regarding clear, defined roles and commitment to resources where required. Key partners were identified and tasked with supporting specific actions. Concluding Remarks Connecting for Life Cork is the result of the collaborative effort of the Cork community, and without this effort, the formation of this action plan would not have been possible. It is with sincere gratitude that our thanks are extended to all members of the community, and we urge you to keep in mind that this action plan is a product of community involvement. Connecting for Life Cork aims to give back to the community in providing a structured system of support with the aim of reducing suicide and self-harm rates across Cork City and County. By connecting and pooling our resources and community spirit, we can achieve this goal - our goal.73 Appendices 74Connecting for Life Cork A&E/ED Accident Vision for Change BSG Bereavement Support Group CAMHS Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services CBDI Community Based Drugs Initiative CBT Cognitive Behavioural Therapy CCCoCo Cork City and County Councils CfL Connecting for Life CHO 4 Community Health Organisation Area 4 (Cork and Kerry) CIT Cork Institute of Technology CLDATF Cork Local Drug and Alcohol Task Force CSO Central Statistics Office CWD CYPSCCommunity Work Department HSE Children and Young People's Service Committee DBT Dialectal Behavioural Therapy DES Department of Education and Skills DoH Department of Health ETB Education and Training Board (Cork) FAI Football Association of Ireland FRC Family Resource Centre GAA Gaelic Athletic Association GLEN Gay and Lesbian Equality Network GP General Practitioner HI Healthy Ireland HRB Health Research Board HPU Health Promotion Unit HSE Health Service Executive HSE H&W Health and Wellbeing HSE MH Mental Health Services HSE PC Primary Care HSE THU Traveller Health Unit IC Implementation Committee ID Intellectual Disability IRFU Irish Rugby Football Union ISG Implementation Steering Group KPI Key Performance Indicator LCDC Local Community Development Committee LECP Local Economic and Community Plan LGBTI Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and IntersexConnecting for - 202076 LINC Lesbians in Cork MABS Money Advice and Budgeting Service NEPS National Educational Psychological Service NGO Non-Governmental Organisation NOSP National Office for Suicide Prevention NSHRI National Self-Harm Registry Ireland NSRF National Suicide Research Foundation PCC Primary Care Centre PCT Primary Care Team ROSP Resource Officer for Suicide Prevention SIU Social Inclusion Unit SPAP Suicide Prevention Action Plan SPSG Suicide Prevention Steering Group (Cork) SRO Suicide Resource Office SSIS Suicide Support and Information System TCHW Traveller Community Health Workers Tusla The National Child and Family Agency UCC University College Cork WHO World Health Organisation YAM Youth Aware of Mental Health Programme YMCA Young Men's Catholic Association YWIW Youth Work Ireland Waterford Connecting for Life Cork 2017 - 202077 Appendix 2: Definition of Key Terms Families/friends/communities bereaved by suicide People who are directly or indirectly affected when someone has died by suicide. HSE mental health services The HSE provides a wide range of community and hospital based mental health services in Ireland, delivered through specialist mental health teams from childhood through to old age. Incidence of self-harm/self-harm rates Managed by the National Suicide Research Foundation, a national registry exists for self-harm presentations to Emergency Departments in General Hospitals. Mental health and wellbeing Defined as a state of wellbeing in which the individual realises his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community. Mental health problems Refers to a wide range of conditions that affect mental health and have a profound impact on mood, thinking and behaviour. Mental health promotion Mental health promotion is any action which aims to promote positive mental health among the population and those who are at risk of experiencing mental health problems. Non-Statutory and community organisations Community, voluntary and non-statutory organisations, services and groups. People/groups vulnerable to suicide People/groups that experience more of the risk factors for suicide. People at acute risk of suicide/self-harm People who are at high risk of suicide or self-harm. This may include frequent, intense and enduring thoughts of suicide or self-harm, specific plans or high distress. People/groups who are vulnerable to self-harm People/groups who are more susceptible than other people/groups to the possibility of self-harm. Primary care services Primary Care Teams comprised of GPs, Public Health Nurses, Occupational Therapists, Physiotherapists, other HSE staff and community representatives. Priority groups In Connecting for Life and Connecting for Life Cork, priority groups refer to the population groups identified as vulnerable to suicide in Ireland. Other population groups may emerge as particularly vulnerable to suicide throughout the implementation of the action plan. Protective and risk factors In general, risk factors increase the likelihood that suicidal behaviour will develop, whereas protective factors reduce this likelihood. In relation to mental health, protective factors include secure family attachments, having one supportive adult during early years, positive early childhood experiences, good physical health, and positive sense of self, effective life and coping skills. Risk factors include physical illness or disability, family history of psychiatric problems, family history of suicide, low self-esteem, social status and childhood neglect.Connecting for Life Cork 2017 - 202078 Reducing suicide/Reducing self-harm Reducing suicide or self-harm means reducing the number of deaths by suicide or the number of self-harm incidents. Resilience Resilience is the ability to cope with adverse or challenging circumstances. Responding to a suicide attempt Response, or intervention, to support someone who attempts suicide. Responding when someone has died by suicide/Postvention Responding to suicide refers to the response, or intervention, to support relatives, friends and communities after someone dies by suicide. Self-harm Self-harm describes the various methods by which people harm themselves. Varying degrees of suicidal intent can be present. Sometimes there may not be any suicidal intent, although an increased risk of further suicidal behaviour is associated with all self-harm. Service user A person who utilises mental health services. Social exclusion Social exclusion refers to being unable to participate in society because of a lack of access to resources that are normally available to the general population. It can refer to both individuals, and communities. Related issues include low incomes, poor housing, high-crime environments and family problems. Stigma reduction The process of minimising negative beliefs associated with different types of mental health problems. It brings about a positive change in public attitudes and behaviour towards people with mental health problems. Suicide/die by suicide Suicide is death resulting from an intentional, self-inflicted act. Suicide attempt/attempted suicide/someone who has attempted suicide A suicide attempt means any non-fatal suicidal behaviour, when someone has the intent to take their own life. Suicidal behaviour Suicidal behaviour refers to a range of behaviours that include planning for suicide, attempting suicide and suicide itself. For the purpose of this action plan, the term suicidal behaviour also refers to self-harm. Suicide prevention/Help prevent suicide Suicide prevention aims to diminish the risk and rates of suicide. It may not be possible to eliminate entirely the risk of suicide but it is possible to reduce this risk. Targeted approach Embedded in a whole population approach and focuses on identifying the smaller number of people who are vulnerable to suicide/self-harm and formulating appropriate interventions. Whole-population approach A whole-population approach focuses on suicide prevention for all members of society. It aims to reduce suicidal behaviour by addressing the risk and protective factors at individual, family, community and societal levels.Connecting for Life Cork 2017 - 202079 Appendix 3 - Community Consultation Questions The following questions and discussion points guided the public meetings: Question one: - How can we work together to reduce suicides and self-harm in Cork City and County while building awareness as a whole community approach to mental health and suicide?
