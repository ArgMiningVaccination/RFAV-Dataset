Security Evacuation (Comprehensive) Coverage (up to the amount shown in the Schedule of Benefits, Se curity Evacuation) is provided for security evacuations for specific Occurrences. To view the covered Occurrences and to download a detailed PDF of this brochure, please go to the following web page: http://www.culturalinsurance.com/cisi_forms.asp Cultural Insurance Services International (CISI) 1 High Ridge Information about CISI Overseas Health Coverage Claim Information If you seek medica l treatment for an Injury or Illness while abroad and pay out -of-pocket, you are eligible to submit a claim for reimbursement. A Claim Form can be found on the following page , on the myCISI Participant Portal, and attached to the welcome e -mail. Please follow the directions at the top of th e Claim Form , and make sure to include any medical documentation you received during your visit and receipts for the out -of- pocket expenses. For your reference, below is some helpful information on how to h andle both minor Injuries or I llnesses and more serious situations. In the Case of a Minor Injury or Illness We are happy to pay a foreign provider directly. Many foreign providers, however, prefer payment from the patient when services are rendered. Insureds using this insurance should be prepared to pay for doctor visits for minor illnesses such as a sore throat or a sinus infection , for example. However, even for a minor illness, if the overseas doctor is willing to bill us directly, we are willing and able to pay them directly for c overed medical expenses (this is always up to the provider). CISI's billing address and claim help # is on each ID card and on the claim form which is part of the brochure. If medical expenses are incurred while abroad, the claim form and scanned copies of the itemized paid bill(s) can be emailed to claimhelp@mycisi.com . Claims should be submitted for processing as soon as possi ble (and no later than one year after treatment was received, if possible). Claims are typically processed within 15 business days provided CISI has all of the information needed for reimbursement. A case does not need to be opened in advance in order fo r us to pay a claim for covered expenses for minor injuries/illnesses. Team Assist (our 24/7 assistance provider) can help provide referrals to doctors/hospitals if needed but insureds may visit any pr ovider they would like and eligible expenses will be covered at 100% (in other words, CISI does not have network restrictions. In the Case of a Serious Injury or Illness In the event of a serious illness or injury requiring expensive treatment or hospitalization, our goal is to have the hospita l or facility bill us directly so that neither the program/sponsor/school nor the insured needs to provide payment. In these s ituations, the insured (or someone calling on his/her behalf) needs to open a medical file with AXA Assistance (our 24/7 assistance provider) asking for help with this. In addition to being able to pay by check, CISI also has the abilit y to wire transfer to fo reign hospitals when necessary/requested. AXA Assistance is also able to guarantee/make payments and has a network of local partners who can make payments on behalf of our insured's when necessary (CISI then reimburses AXA Assistance). AXA Assistance (ou r medical/travel/technical partner) and WorldAware (our security partner) are both 24/7 ope rations. To keep things simple , the number to call for a medical/travel/technical issue is the same as for a security related issue. The toll -free 800 and non -800 (when c alling from overseas) numbers for AXA Assistance are provided below a s well as on the ID card and in the brochure under the claim form. On the claim form we list CISI's claim help line (203 -399-5130) and e -mail address (claimhelp@mycisi.com ) which are answ ered from 9 -5 EST M -F. AXA Assistance has 24/7 access to our enrollment database and also has access to each group's coverage information. If a benefit or claim related call or e -mail comes to AXA Assistance during our business hours it is usually transfe rred to us. After hours and on weekends, AXA Assistance handles the communications and involves our Claims Operations Manager as needed 24/7. An Important Note about Medical and Security Evacuations Sometimes an insured's medical condition requires a medical evacuation to obtain fu rther medical treatment in the nearest adequate location or back in the U.S. Sometimes insureds are required to evacuate due to security concerns. It is important for insureds to know that in order for me dical or security -related evacuation costs to be covered all approvals and arrangements must be made by AXA Assistance in conjunction with the attending physician (for a medical evacuation) and with WorldAware (for a security evacuation). Anyone may contact AXA Assistance (see information below) to open a medical or security file if assistance is needed or if evacuation may be a possibility.
