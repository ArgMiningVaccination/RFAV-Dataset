Any fees or other charges due to late payment or non-payment are liquidated damages intended to be a reasonable advance estimate of our costs resulting from late payments and non-payments. These costs are difficult to calculate or to predict when we set such fees or other charges, including our current $10 late fee ($5 in Maryland), because we cannot know in advance (1) whether you will pay for our goods or services on a timely basis, if ever; (2) when you will actually pay if you do pay late; and (3) what costs we will incur because of your late payment or non-payment. - Invalid Payments. We accept various means of payment for our goods and services, including payment by check for certain goods and services.

[Show Content Hide Content](#ltClimbingandBoulderingc762) Climbing and Bouldering We have adopted climbing and bouldering rules to promote the safe use of our climbing wall area. Some centers may have additional rules as required by state or local law. If you violate our climbing wall policies, we may terminate your climbing or bouldering privileges and/or your membership. - General Rules. Be aware that climbing is an inherently dangerous activity that can result in serious bodily harm even when safety policies are followed. To reduce the risk of injury, Life Time requires that all persons who enter the climbing area (\"you\" or climbers\") comply with Life Time policies, instructions from our Team Members, use climbing equipment as intended, and be aware of their surroundings at all times. No person may climb or boulder unless an approved Life Time Team Member is present in the climbing area. - Age and Weight Limits. All climbers must be at least five years old to enter the climbing area. No climber under the age of 14 may belay or lead climb. \"It is recommended that the belayer be of equal or greater weight than the climber.\" - New Jersey centers have different age, weight and height requirements, please consult your center. - Junior Climber Supervision. Climbers under the age of 12 (\"junior climber\") must be directly and actively supervised at all times by a parent or guardian unless enrolled in a Life Time-supervised program. Direct and active supervision means that the parent or guardian visually observes and physically attends to the climber at all times while in the climbing area, including performing the pre-climbing checks below. - Waiver of Liability. You must read, complete and execute a Waiver and Release of Liability at least once per year. If you are under age 18, your parent or legal guardian must execute a Waiver and Release of Liability before you use the climbing area. - Guest waivers are valid for a single visit and must be completed each subsequent visit. - Check-In. All persons entering the climbing area must check-in with a Life Time team member to verify they have a valid waiver on file and have received an orientation on our policies and procedures. - Equipment and Attire. You may use only approved climbing equipment and climbing (or athletic) shoes in the climbing area (e.g., you may not climb in bare feet, sandals, or in hard-soled or loose fitting shoes.) You may use chalk balls only, not powdered or block chalk. Life Time reserves the right to refuse usage of any equipment our team deems unsafe. - Age and Weight Limits. All climbers must be at least five years old to enter the climbing area. No climber under the age of 14 may belay or lead climb. \"It is recommended that the belayer be of equal or greater weight than the climber.\" - Pre-Climbing Checks. - New Climber Orientation. If you are a new climber to Life Time, prior to climbing, you must receive an orientation from a Life Time Team Member. This orientation will cover facility rules, proper usage of auto-belay systems, as well as bouldering rules and proper spotting technique. During the orientation you will be asked to demonstrate you can clip in and then out of an auto-belay - failure to do so may result in you not being deemed proficient and for your own safety, be required to be assisted by a Life Time Team Member. - Belay and Lead Climb Test Out. If you wish to belay (top rope or lead) or lead climb, you must pass a belay test out in which you demonstrate safety and competence in manual belay (i.e., use of the proper belaying technique, commands, and fall arrests). If you complete this test out, we will update your level of certification in our system. You must re-certify with us annually to ensure that your skills are up-to-date. - Double Check Before You Climb. Before beginning each climb, climbers must double check their harness and connection, including specifically, but not limited to, the fit of their harness, auto-belay carabiners, and/or rope knot. If climbing with a belayer, the climber and the belayer must double check each other's gear. The belayer must check the climber's gear and connection to the rope (assuring both climber and belayer are attached to the same rope). The climber must check the belayer's system, including specifically, but not limited to, the fit of their harness and belay tool setup. Both must exchange universal climbing commands prior to the start of the climb to confirm proper double checks were completed. This critically important step must be performed vigilantly at the start of each and every climb. - Climbing. In an attempt to avoid dangerous swings or unsafe climbing situations, climbers should only climb on designated routes or by following a vertical path, for example while using the auto belay. The belayer must actively pay attention to the climber, keeping direct eye contact on them at all times. When not actively climbing you may not hang on ropes, touch or climb on video cameras, auto belay equipment, lead route anchors or other non-climbing equipment. - Bouldering. You must have at least one spotter at all times while bouldering. You may not boulder above the shoulder height of whomever is shorter-the climber or the spotter. - Lessons. We offer climbing lessons. For instructional purposes, lessons in progress have priority on routes. If an instructor needs your climbing route for a lesson, the instructor may require that you vacate or refrain from using a particular route. - Reporting. Any unsafe situations or equipment must be reported to a Life Time Team Member immediately. Knowingly failing to do so may result in the termination of your climbing or bouldering privileges and/or your membership. [Show Content Hide Content](#ltFitnessFloor580d) Fitness Floor - Age Limit.
