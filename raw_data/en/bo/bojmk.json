Getting Uncle Sam up off the couch Jeff Naffziger Iowa City Honoring animal carcasses To the Editor: For many people, Thanksgiving is a harmless holiday gathering with friends and family, to give thanks and have a meal together. However, in a different aspect, Thanksgiving is the most exploitive holiday Americans celebrate. It is a hol\u00ad iday that focuses on the carcass of an animal. Humans have become desensitized to the suf\u00ad fering; 0( turkeys because they have been anthro\u00ad pomorphized in advertising. making it seem like they are more than willing to sacrifice their lives so humans can stuff their faces. Thanksgiving is a rather normal ritual for most people because it is an everyday event to sit down and eat a carcass. To me, though, the holi\u00ad days should be a peaceful gathering where no being is oppressed or objectified -which is exactly what is being done to these helpless crea\u00ad tures. r Rebecca Woodham UI Animal Coalition co-chairperson I didn't think it would ever come to this.

TROOPS WOULD ENFORCE ACCORD Agreement or not; Peace talks near end :~ Barry Schweid Associated Press DAYTON, Ohio -Bosnia peace talks moved toward a windup Sun\u00ad day with indications that spirited American mediation would produce an agreement to settle a 43-month war in which an estimated quarter\u00ad million people have perished. As Secretary of State Warren Christopher tried to resolve remaining differences with Balkan leaders, U.S. officials said at least four key issues had been settled and were in a draft agreement being prepared for initialing at a ceremony today. \"Clearly, we are approaching the end,n State Department spokesper\u00ad son Nicholas Burns said. Cautious\u00ad ly, he told reporters , \"it could be an initialing ceremony or it could be a press conference that marks the end of these peace talks without an agreement.\" If there is an accord, President Clinton is pledged to contribute some 20,000 U.S. troops to help enforce it. The House voted Friday to deny the administration the funds for deployment . House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Sun\u00ad day \"the president has done almost nothing to explain to the American people why his Bosnia policy makes sense.\" The agreement would set up two ethnic republics in the former Yugoslav republic, one controlled jointly by MuelimB and Croats, the other by Serbs. The central govern\u00ad ment would be in charge of foreign affairs and Little else, \u00b7t\" There would be a collective presi-'. dency and the United States would ... help arm and train the Bosnian army, U.S. officials told the AP. A draft agreement provides also for a separation of rival armies with a demilitarized zone four kilo-.. meters wide and for the Bosnian Serbs to retain control of Srebreni- ca and Zepa, Muslim enclaves they overran even though the United Nations had designated the zones to be safe havens . Last week, the U.N. war crimes .n tribunal indicted Radovan Karadz- , ic and Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian .

City, Iowa -Monday, November 20, 1995 Egyptian Embassy in Pakistan bombed Kathy Gannon Associated Press ISLAMABAD , Pakistan -A sui\u00ad cide bomber rammed his explosive\u00ad packed truck into the Egyptian Embassy on Sunday, killing 15 peo\u00ad ple and wounding at least 59 oth\u00ad ers. Islamic militants claimed responsibility for the attack aimed at Egypt's secular regime, the United Ststes' most powerful Arab ally. In Washington, the White House said the United States offered to help find the culprits. In Cairo, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak decried \"the shed\u00ad ding of innocent people's blood.\" The attack came 10 days before Egyptians vote for a new parlia\u00ad ment in elections Islamic militants have urged them to boycott. Most of the dead were Pakistani security guards and visa seekers, although four Egyptians -one diplomat and three security guards -were among the dead carried out of the embassy on stretchers, hospitsl officials said. Survivors said there were two explosions : a smaller blast followed by a second, much more powerful explosion . The explosions destroyed the entire visa section, leaving behind a 10-foot crater. The second blast did most of the damage, blowing out windows in nearby buildings , sending chunks of concrete and shrapnel flying for several yards. An entire wall of the two-story building was blown away. A shattered picture of Mubarak hung crookedly on a damaged wall. \"I was stsnding outside the gate and the body of a police officer . came flying over the wall and land\u00ad ed beside me,\" said Police Consta\u00ad ble Mohammed Iqbal, a security guard for Egypt's Ambassador Mohammed Noman Galal. Galal, who was unharmed , said \"the bomb blasts were a ghastly act by someone lacking basic moral and human values.\" Within moments of the attack dozens of people rushed to the embassy compound to search for survivors. They dug through the rubble with their hands, pulled at twisted pieces of metsl and tossed chunks of cement aside. Several stunned embassy employees stumbled over the rub\u00ad ble, some shouting for help, others weeping. A dozen ambulances raced to the scene. Army troops cordoned off the street outside the Egyptian embassy. Soldiers in machine\u00b7 gun mounted vehicles took positions in the diplomatic enclave, where most foreign missions are located. Egypt's militant Islamic opposi\u00ad tion group aI-Gamma al-Islamiya, or Islamic Group, claimed responsi\u00ad for the explosion, Interior Minister Nasrullah Babaar said. Babaar took responsibility for a \"lapse in security arrangements\" at the embassy. \"My head hangs in shame over the death of so many people,\" he said in a statement carried by the state-run news agency. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto sent her condolences to Egypt's president and vowed to \"do every\u00ad thing possible to bring them (ter\u00ad rorists) to justice.\" In Washington , the White House called the bombing a \"murderous attack.\" President Clinton offered condolences for those kil)ed and wounded and pledged to convey his outrage to Mubarak and Bhutto. \"The United Ststes stsnds ready to work with the governments of Pakistan and Egypt to help deter\u00ad mine those responsible for this crime and bring them to justice,\" the White House ststement said. Foreign Minieter Sardar Aseff Ali said on nation'll television the suicide bomber may have blasted his way through the embassy gate. Pakistan is reviewing its security arrangements for foreign missions in the capital, said Gul Hanif, a foreign ministry spokesperson . Associated Press An employee of the Egyptian Embassy walks amidst the debris left following an explosion at the diplomatic compound in Islamabad, Pakistan Sunday. A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy , several blocks away from the bombing site, said security arrangements were being reviewed , but they had no com\u00b7 plaints about the protection provid\u00b7 ed by Pakistsn . \"We're satisfied with what Pak\u00ad istan provides, but we also make our own arrangements with con-tract security personnel ,\" said spokesperson Jack McCreary.

Winy a ter lorida's weekend R publican straw poll: 33 percent is 't a particularly strong showing fo,r a front-runner . And some voters who broke from the Senate majority leader at the end raised troubling questions about his commitment to the con\u00ad servative cause. But as the campaign moved quickly Sunday to the site of the first presidential primary next year, there were plenty of reminders that as front-runners go, Dole may be fragile -but he is also quite formi\u00ad dable. For starters, there was word the field isn't likely to have a final, dra\u00ad matic entry: House Speaker Newt Gingrich indicated he would announce shortly after Thanksgiv\u00ad ing he won't run for president next year. And, with 85 days to Iowa's cau\u00ad cuses and 93 to New Hampshire's primary, there was compelling evi\u00ad dence of the organizational advan\u00b7 tages Dole is counting on in next year's busy stretch of early pri\u00b7 maries: the RepUblican governors of those two states, and 13 others, are behind Dole. \"This organization is deep and it is motivated ,\" said New Hampshire Gov. Steve Merrill, who endorsed Dole two weeks ago. , \"It is absolutely crystsl clear that Dole is going to be nominated,\" said Mississippi Gov. Kirk Fordice, who i~ likely to back Dole soon. . Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thomp\u00ad sOn, who is neutral in the presiden\u00ad t~al race, wouldn't go as far as Fordice but said: \"Dole has. got to stumble badly before anyone else will have a shot.\" : Dole's rivals predict he ultimately Kim Mills Associated Press WASHINGTON -The flirting is over for House Speaker Newt Gingrich: He said Sunday he won't enter the 1996 presidential race. Gingrich , R-Ga., had dropped broad hints last week that he was leaning against running. On Sunday, in classic Washington fashion, Gingrich said on nation\u00ad al TV he'd made a decision, told the country what it was but said he wouldn't actually announce it for a few more days. \"Probably , we're going to announce I would say early next week or the week after Thanks\u00ad giving that I'm not going to run,\" Gingrich, R-Ga., said on ABC's will stumble, and suggested Satur\u00ad day's Florida results proved him vulnerable . Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, who placed second, noted that 67 percent of the Florida GOP activists voted against Dole, hardly a ringing endorsement . Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander noted Dole has slipped behind President Clin\u00ad ton in head-to-head polls, and pre\u00ad dicted GOP voters ultimately would turn to someone from outside Wash\u00ad ington as a stronger challenger to President Clinton. Dole had hoped for a big Florida win to create the aura his nomina\u00ad tion was inevitable, and to convince GOP donors to give up on Gramm and Alexander. But his final total was below what aides had predict\u00ad ed, even below the campaign's count of solidly committed delegates , sug\u00ad gesting his pitch wasn't very con- ~TOYOTA Service ley.\" The speaker said his wife, Marianne , and younger daughter were in Washington on Sunday and implied they had spent some time debating the question. \"We were going to get together over Thanksgiving and talk about this and make a final deci\u00ad sion,\" Gingrich said. He acknowledged Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, R\u00ad Kan., is leading the GOP pack, having won a straw poll in Flori\u00ad da on Saturday . Gingrich was the last credible holdout on the Republican side after retired Gen. Colin Powell announced Nov. 8 he would not enter the fray but that he would join the Grand Old Party. vincing. Handicapping the results, Gin\u00ad grich said on ABC's \"This Week with David Brinkley \" that Dole \"didn't do quite as well as he want\u00ad ed to, but he's still the front\u00b7 run\u00ad ner.\" Florida GOP chairperson Tom Slade suggested \"everyone south of third (place) ought to pack it in.\" One or two of them may do so before the year ends, a period also critical to Gramm, Alexander and anyone else who hopes to emerge as a threat to Dole. It will take a, few weeks to see whether Gramm and Alexander will be able to generate new campaign contributions . But both vowed they were in for the long haul. Gramm, at a Republican Gover\u00b7 Using any other assumptions, as the White House wants, \"is code word for spend more money,\" Gramm said. Dole vowed in Florida this would be no \"autumn of compromise\" with Clinton, but it was clear in delegate interviews that Dole was hurt by the perception he is too quick to compromise . Darin Pierce said he chose Gramm because Dole \"seemed like he was hedging all his ahswers\" in a debate Friday night. Another, C. Jane Rankie, called Dole a Republi\u00ad can treasure, but said he was \"a leg\u00ad islator not a president.\" Such impressions are the major risk of Dole's dual roles of candidate and Senate majority leader. Candidate Dole tries to turn it to his advantsge . He told straw poll delegates that under his leadership \"we have turned revolutionary rhetoric into legislative reality.\" But Ohio Gov. George Voinovich , a Dole supIJorter, said the duty to seek consensus as majority leader kept Dole from \"getting out in front\" on some issues. Voinovich recom\u00ad mended Dole resign the post. Dole has said he might step down if he won Iowa and New Hampshire -something that would give him a solid grip on the nomination. But Dole is unlikely to take Voinovich 's advice in the short term because he believes being majority leader gives him enormous advantages over his rivals. You 'Il wear the dress for one day.

The Iron Curtain has fallen to a new world order, and the power plays of P9litical agendas have been replaced by ruth\u00ad less plots for profit. The war may have changed, but' one thing, at least in the cinematic world, remains the same: Bond. James Bond. Pierce Brosnan dusts off the role of everyone's favorite spy in the newest Bond installment, \"GOlCieneye.\" Combining explosive action, elabo\u00ad rate stunts and trademark humor, the 17th James Bond action adventure has all the ele\u00ad ments that make it a worthy successor to the sevies. \" Goldeneye\" finds Bond where we left him last -oruising around the British countryside. Before long, he runs into the first of the film's \"Bond girls' -a ruthless, seductive spy with the Courtesy Keith Hamshere!United Artists classically laughable name -Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen).

Director Martin Campbell (\"No Escape\") has loaded the film with one stunning visual after another. \"Goldeneye\" goes to great Bnd almost ridiculous lengths to impress the viewers and assure us this is not the same old Bond. In the end, \"Goldeneye\" turns out to be the best film in the Bond series. Brosnan has given viewers something Connery never could - strength and emotion. Although the plot may seem trite to some, the film ends up as a roller\u00ad coaster ride with explosions, action and humor around each corner. \"Goldeneye\" even serves up an examination of the Bond myth itself.

We've heard of hairless cats, dogs and kiwi fruits, but the hair\u00ad les8 man seems to be the recent advent of Calvin Klein, Versace and Armani ads.

Sleek and cetacean, the hairless man would nevllr.be caught dead with Burt Reynold's chest mg of yesteryear. Gosh, and we gals always thought shaving our legs was sim\u00ad ply another tool of corporate-male oppression. Maybe that avid gleam in our boyfriends' eyes as they watched us shave our legs was jealousy and not lust. Think marble statues when you think of the hairless man. Ad whizzes pick models resembling Greek gods and the Italian Renaissance version of the Chip\u00ad pendale dancers. David had no body hair. Adonis and Zeus waxed diligently on a weekly basis to make sure they didn't give their loved ones razor burn. The mod\u00ad ern hairless man has all the buff\u00ad ness and machismo of classic mas\u00ad culinity intact, except that he's as hairless as a newborn baby. Where did the hairless-man trend come from? Have men final-ly realized that feminization is the only way humankind will survive into the next millennium? Ie the hairlesa look a response to multi\u00ad culturalism, in which the hairy simian white man looks apeiah next to his less-hairy Alian and African brothers?

' Late interceptions also killed the Hawkeyes against Penn State ea:r\u00ad Iier this year. Just like the inter-' ceptions that ended Michigan State and Indiana's hopes in Iowa's earli\u00ad er victories. It's no real surprise that the team on the receiving end of the most turnovers gets the win. Robinson and Knight both said they're always looking for the big plays. Sherman said he's trying to avoid the interceptions . Sounds like they've got the win\u00ad ning ingredient . If they don't turn the ball over, they won't tum Floy~ over.

The bowl picture is coming into focus ~ although many pieces of the postseason puzzle still aren't in place. to the Orange Bowl to play No. 25 Miami or No. 13 Virginia Tech. Miami will get the bid if it beats No. 22 Syracuse. That would leave the Sugar Bowl with a matchup between the Flori\u00ad da-Florida State loser and the Southwest Conference champion (No.9 Texas, No. 15 Texas A&M or Baylor). Of course, the Orange and Sugar lineups could change if Florida State beats Florida and the Gators defeat No. 23 Arkansas the follow\u00ad ing week in the Southeastern Con\u00ad ference title game. Then the Orange might take homes tate favorite Florida, leaving Notre Dame in the Sugar. be available for the Michigan game. No.3 Florida 38, Vanderbilt 7 At Gainesville, Chris Doering caught 11 passes for 169 yards and two TDs and Danny Wuerffel threw for 299 yards and two scores. No.4 Northwestern 23, Purdue 8 At West Lafayette, Darnell Autry gained a career-high 226 yards as Northwestern clinched a share of its first conference title since 1936. No.6 Tenne8llee 84, Kentucky 31 At Lexington, Peyton Manning passed for two touchdowns and ran for another in the second half as Tennessee rallied to beat heavy underdog Kentucky. No.6 Florida St. 69, Maryland 17 for another as Kansas reached nine wins for the first time since 1968.

No. 13 Virginia Tech 38, No, 19 Vlrrinia 29 At Charlottesville, Jim Drucken\u00ad miller threw a go-ahead TD pass to Jermaine Holmes with 47 seconds left and Antonio Banks clinched it with a 65-yard interception return on the final play. No. 14 Penn State 27, No. 18 Michigan 17 At State College, Wally Richard- son threw two TD passes and Penn State scored on a fake field goal with 2:40 remaining. The Cotton Bowl became the first New Year's game to set it:./! match up. No.8 Colorado earned its berth Saturday with a 27-17 victo\u00ad ry over No. 10 Kansas State, while No. 12 Oregon gained the other invitation with a 12-10 win over Oregon State. UCLA's 24-20 win over No. 17 Southern Cal sent the Bruins to the Aloha Bowl, where they may play No. 11 Kansas. There's also the remote chance of Florida losing to Arkansas and dropping completely out of the alliance, which awards berths to the SEC, SWC, Atlantic Coast, Big Eight and Big East champions along with Notre Dame if it finish\u00ad es in the Top 10. At Tallahassee, Danny Kanell set an ACC record for career TD passes as Florida State tied Vir\u00ad ginia for the league title. No. 16 Tens A&M 66, Middle Tennenee St. 14 At College Station, Albert Con\u00ad nell caught a 61-yard TD pass on the second play of the game and Leeland McElroy ran for two scores in the first quarter. Auoclaled Press Purdue's Brian Alford pulls in a pass Saturday against Northwestern. No. 20 Washington got a Sun Bowl bid after defeating Washing\u00ad ton State 33-30. The Huskies' opponent is expected to be Michi\u00ad gan State or Iowa. 'Ibp-ranked Nebraska didn't play Saturday , but the Cornhuskers clinched the outright Big Eight title and a spot in the alliance when Colorado beat Kansas State. The Huskers will play for the national championship in the fies\u00ad ta ,Bowl if they beat Oklahoma on Friday. Their opponent should be the winner of Saturday 'S game between No.3 Florida and No.6 Florida State. No. 7 Notre Dame, which locked up an alliance bid by beating Air Force 44-14, appears to be headed Despite its loss to UCLA, South\u00ad ern Cal is going to the Rose Bowl as Pac-10 co-champion. The Tro\u00ad jans finished with the same league record as Washington, but they earned the Rose Bowl trip with a better overall record. Southern Cal's Big Ten opponent in Pasadena will be No.2 Ohio State or No.4 Northwestern. It will be Ohio State if the Buckeyes beat No. 18 Michigan.

The intercep\u00b7 tion bug that has been biting Sher\u00ad man in clutch moments over the past four weeks was attacking Bev\u00b7 ell in the second half. \"He's a great motivator and a great per80n. Coach Fry is one of the best coaches in America. I'm very honored to play for him.\u00b7 Fry was touched. \"I didn't really care what the rea\u00ad son was,\u00b7 he said. \"The fact that they did it was important. I accept\u00ad ed the ball on behalf of all the coaches because they all worked their tail off. \"That's the first game ball. since I've been at Iowa and it looked like one of the most beaten up balls I've ever seen: he added in jest. \"It must have been the actual game ball.\u00b7 Iowa used 214 rushing yards and three touchdowns by Sed rick Shaw to raise its record to 6\u00b74 overall, 3\u00b74 in the Big Ten and one win short of qualifying for a bowl game. Wisconsin dropped to 4-5-1 with the loss, ending its bowl-game hopes. Iowa took the opening drive of the game 80 yards, capped off West',turn's title game into blowout Chuck Schnoffner Associated Press CEDAR FALLS, Iowa -The turnaround is complete at Iowtl City West. Only three years ago, West had a 35-game losing streak in foot\u00ad ball. Friday night, the school cel\u00ad ebrated a state championship . Top-ranked West overwhelmed No. 3 West Des Moines Dowling with its quickness and beat the Maroon. 42-0 to win the Class 4A state title and cap an unbeat\u00ad en seuon. It was the bigge8t margin ever in a championship game, topping Bettendorf's 41-0 victory over West Des Moines Valley in the 1992 4A finals. West (13-0) won the champi\u00ad onship after maki.ni the playoff's for the first time just last year. Dowling (11-2) W88 in the Iinalll for the sixth time and lost for the sixtb time. Coach Reese Morgan engi\u00ad neered the turnaround at Wellt after building a winner at Van Horne Benton. Hi. fint Welt team went 1-8 in 1992 but there has been Iteady improvement 6.

VOIli Xayk08Y, a 5-foot-7, 150- pound bundle of speed, ran for three touchdowns and Ryan Hanllen paaaed for a touchdown and ran for another. The Trojana hardly mined a beat even though leading rusher Carlos Honore WBI hobbled by a stresa fracture in his foot. Honore, who entered the game with 1,543 yards, played but clearly lacked the explosiveness that had made him so effective. But with West's lightning-quick defenlle, which posted It I ninth shutout of the Tro\u00ad jana wouldn't have needed much oft'eD.l8. Dowling had been Iveraging 30 points a game in the playoffs, but the Maroons were hard\u00ad prelsed to do anything ,again lit Wellt. Quarterback Luke Beuer- See WEST, hp 11 20 16.

Wisconsin scratched its running attack and put its comeback and bowl-game hopes into the arm of senior quarterback Darrell Bevell in the second half. The plan was Davis sets his sights on the Heisman R.B. Fallstrom Associated Press COLUMBIA, Mo. -Troy Davis got 2,000 yards and now he wants more.

For the cap\u00ad per to his sophomore year, he wants the Heisman Trophy. \"If he gets it, more power to him,\" Missouri defensive back Shad Criss said.
