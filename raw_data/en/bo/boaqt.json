Steiner carefully corrects certain misunderstandings that arose regarding his spiritual-scientific research, showing how Anthroposophy has nothing to do with mysticism or spiritualism. Nor is it merely a revival of ancient esoteric teachings. Rather, Anthroposophy is a truly modern spiritual teaching for Western humanity, building on the achievements of science and developing an exact methodology for developing the investigation of spiritual realities by awakening higher organs of perception. These two lectures were translated from the German in Philosophie und Anthroposophie: Gesammelte Aufs\u00e4tze 1904-1923 (GA 35). C O N T E N T S: The Mission of Spiritual Science and of Its Building at Dornach Preface Lecture given at Liestal, Basle, Jan. 11, 1916 Afterword Human Life from the Perspective of Spiritual Science Preface Lecture given at Liestal, Basle, Oct. 16, 1916 Supplementary Note Notes About the Author Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up. As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe's scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner's multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland. "}
