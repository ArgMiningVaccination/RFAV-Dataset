NO 1 APRIL 2015 The West African Ebola epidemic began in December 2013, peaked during the period September - December 2014, and is now gradually declining. To date, the vast majority of cases have occurred in Sierra Leone and Liberia although the highest case fatality rate comes from Guinea. Fortunately, no Ebola cases have been confirmed in South Africa since the outbreak was announced. An update of the epidemic is given in this issue, which also includes three surveillance reports. The 2015 winter influenza season in South Africa will once again be carefully monitored by several influenza surveillance programmes coordinated at the NICD. Last year, these programmes showed that the season in South Africa was predominated by influenza A(H3N2), followed by influenza B and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. This is also the first report that combines viral pathogens with additional testing for bacterial pathogens as well as some of the atypical causes of pneumonia. Sentinel site surveillance of transmitted HIV drug resistance (TDR) is ongoing and the results from specimens collected as part of the 2012 national antenatal sentinel HIV & Herpes Simplex Type -2 prevalence survey in South Africa are reported here. These data provide the first national TDR estimate for South Africa and indicate that levels of TDR are low to moderate. Antimicrobial resistance surveillance is also conducted at the NICD, and aims to determine the extent of resistance amongst the most important disease causing pathogens in South Africa. Data presented in this issue show the extent of antimicrobial resistance by pathogen for 2014. All contributors are thanked for their inputs and I trust you will find these reports useful and interesting.

Five diverse species of Ebola virus have been described to date but only the Zaire and Sudan ebolaviruses have been associated with sizeable and highly fatal human outbreaks.1 Natural outbreaks caused by Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) have been described mostly from equatorial Africa, but the current outbreak in West Africa suggests that the geographic distribution of the virus may be more widespread than anticipated.2 The Ebola viruses in Africa are thought to be maintained in specific species of arboreal bats, but exact mechanisms of spill - over into other susceptible animal and human populations are not fully understood.3-5 Various outbreaks have been traced back to index patients that had contact with bushmeat, for example chimpanzees during the Gabon outbreak in 1996, and bats during the 2014 Democratic Republic of Congo outbreak.6-7 The likely index case of the ongoing West Africa outbreak was a two -year-old patient that died in December 2013, who supposedly had contact with bats while playing in a hollow tree near his home.8-9 Once the virus has spilled over to humans, outbreaks are perpetuated by direct contact with infected bodily fluids, secreta and excreta. This mode of transmission predisposes healthcare workers, relatives and friends caring for the sick.10-12 Burial ceremonies have been recognized as a major risk factor for transmission.10-12 A more comprehensive overview of EVD was provided in the previous NICD Communicable Disease Surveillance Bulletin (2014, Volume 12 number 4, pages 109-116). Here we give an update on the outbreak developments in West Africa and summarize the response launched by the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) to this event. EVD in West Africa On 29 March 2015, one year since the outbreak was first reported, a cumulative total of 25 178 EVD cases (laboratory -confirmed, probable and suspected), including 10 445 deaths with an overall case fatality rate (CFR) of 41% has been reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the three countries currently affected with intense transmission, i.e. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.13 The outbreak started in Guinea's southern district, Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou in December 2013, with subsequent spread to other districts (including the capital Conakry), as well as neighbouring countries Liberia and Sierra Leone. A marked increase in the number of EVD cases was noted from July 2014 onward with a peak occurring in September/October 2014 in Liberia and November/ December in Sierra Leone, before gradually declining to lower levels in 2015. Rates of disease incidence have differed by country, with Sierra Leone and Liberia being the most affected. As of 29 March 2015, the total number of EVD cases reported per country was 3 492 EVD cases in Guinea, despite the fact that the epidemic started there, and totals of 9 712 and 11 974 EVD cases in Liberia and Sierra Leone, respectively.13 Over the past 21 days, one new confirmed case was reported from Liberia on 20 March (who later died on 27 March), EBOLA VIRUS DISEASE OUTBREAK IN WEST AFRICA: ONE YEAR DOWN THE LINE AND THE NICD RESPONSE Jacqueline Weyer1, and Zoonotic Diseases, NICD 2Division of Public Health Surveillance and Response, NICD 3 C O M M U N I C A B L E D I S E A S E S S U R V E I L L A N C E B U L L E T I N V O L U M E 1 3 , N O . 1 while Guinea and Sierra Leone continued reporting relatively many new cases (197 and 113 respectively) and deaths over the same period (8 -29 March).13 Sustained transmission of infection occurred at community level for a prolonged time in numerous regions and towns across all three affected countries. However, the numbers of cases differ within regions with certain districts accounting for a higher proportion of total cases than others, while other areas remain unaffected. In Guinea, transmission remains centred in the west of the country, in and around the capital Conakry and nearby prefectures (Boffa, Coyah, Dubreka and Forecariah). Two additional prefectures, Fria in the west and Siguiri, to the north on the border with Mali, reported cases for the first time in over 50 days. In Sierra Leone confirmed cases are still being reported from the northern and western districts as well as in and around the capital Freetown (Bombali, Kambia, Port Loko, and Western Rural) in the week leading to 29 March 2015 (figure 1).

However, unsafe burials and unknown chains of transmission (those who were not known to be contacts of a previous case) continue to be reported, especially in Guinea. EVD status in South Africa, SADC region and other countries Even though the outbreak has been largely confined to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, there is a concern about importing EVD cases into other countries. No EVD cases have been confirmed in South Africa since the West African outbreak was announced.

It is also noted that case fatality rates (CFR) vary from country to country and per location within each country: the highest overall CFR is recorded for Guinea (66%; 2314/3492), followed by Liberia with a CFR of 45% (4332/9712) and the lowest death rate (32%; 3799/11974) amongst all cases is documented for Sierra Leone. Healthcare workers (HCWs) have frequently been infected while treating patients with suspected or confirmed EVD and their case numbers and deaths continue to be reported up until present. To date, 861 cases amongst HCWs have been reported, with 495 deaths (CFR: 57%); the highest HCWs CFR is being reported from Sierra Leone (73%).13 Where information on age and gender is available, people aged 15 -44 are three times more likely to be affected than children (<15 years), and those 45 and over, three to five times more likely. Rates of disease incidence are similar between males and females within all three affected countries (figure 2.)13 5 C O M M U N I C A B L E D I S E A S E S S U R V E I L L A N C E B U L L E T I N V O L U M E 1 3 , N O . 1 travellers from the affected countries that present with features suggestive of EVD. No EVD cases have been documented from other SADC countries to date. Thus far there are six countries i.e. Nigeria (20 cases, 8 deaths), Mali (8 cases, 6 deaths), Senegal (1 case), United States of America (4 cases, 1 death), Spain (1 case) and the United Kingdom (1 case) that have reported localised transmission or imported a case or cases from Guinea/Liberia/Sierra Leone. Nonetheless, the EVD outbreaks in these countries have been declared over. The latest imported EVD case -patient, a healthcare worker who returned from volunteering at an Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone, was confirmed EVD positive on 29 December 2014 in Scotland in the United Kingdom, but has recovered and gained EVD - negative status on 24 January 2015.14 NICD response to the EVD outbreak EVD testing of returned travellers to South Africa or SADC, and other national activities The Centre for Emerging and Zoonotic Diseases (CEZD) of the NICD operates the only maximum biosafety laboratory (biosafety level 4) in Africa. With more than 30 years history in the laboratory diagnosis and investigation of viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) including EVD, the NICD represents a critical national and international resource during the current EVD outbreak in West Africa. The CEZD is recognized by the WHO as one of nine laboratories worldwide for expertise in diagnosis of filoviruses, and has a status of World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research of VHFs and Arboviruses. From February 2014 to date, samples from a total of 37 suspected cases were subjected to testing at the CEZD at the NICD in Johannesburg. Eight of these cases were referred from other African countries including Zimbabwe (n=2), Namibia (n=4), Angola and Ethiopia (not SADC). The remainder were patients presenting to South African health -care facilities, who required follow - up for suspected EVD. All of these cases tested negative for EVD. The differential diagnosis of these cases revealed infectious and non -infectious causes of disease. A total of ten cases was diagnosed with malaria, but laboratory testing also supported trypanosomiasis (n=1), dengue (n=1) and parvovirus infection (n=1). Two cases involving Nigerian patients were related to complications of sickle -cell anaemia, a common hereditary condition in the Nigerian population. One patient was diagnosed with severe complications of autoimmune disease, whilst another died from a possible drug reaction. In addition to follow up of suspected cases, the NICD also contributed to drafting of guidelines, EVD risk communication to the general public and other stakeholders, and various training activities to support responses to EVD in other countries. With the outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa, the NICD has also initiated an Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) in South Africa to prepare and respond better to high -risk outbreaks such as Ebola in the country, in line with its mandate by the National Department of Health. Ebola molecular diagnostic facility in Sierra Leone With the momentum of the EVD outbreak in Liberia and Sierra Leone building after June 2014, and in response to international calls for assistance, the NICD of South Africa has been actively involved in the hot zone. In mid-August 2014, the NICD deployed its field Ebola Molecular Diagnostic Facility (EMDF) to Freetown, Sierra Leone. Under Professor Janusz Paweska's leadership, volunteers from the NICD and from the University of Pretoria were deployed under the management of the Global Outbreak Response Network of the World Health Organization. The EMDF established by CEZD -NICD in Freetown -Lakka, Sierra Leone, is a significant collaborative effort of the Sierra 6 C O M M U N I C A B L E D I S E A S E S S U R V E I L L A N C E B U L L E T I N V O L U M E 1 3 , N O . 1 Up to March 2015 the NICD had deployed eight teams to operate the EMDF in Freetown -Lakka, each comprising of 2 -5 members, rotating every 4 -6 weeks. Since the second week of the NICD EMDF operation, the NICD staff undertook intensive training of Sierra Leonean scientists and technical personnel in facility operational logistics, biosafety and Ebola diagnostic procedures. The national staff became fully integrated into all aspects of functions and operation of the EMDF. The Western Urban Area of Sierra Leone, where the NICD EMDF operates, remained a hotspot of the EVD epidemic for months. Consequently, this facility played a major role in providing Ebola diagnostic services for Sierra Leone, especially during the first months of the epidemic, when it was the only Ebola diagnostic facility in Freetown. As of 31 March 2015, the NICD EMDF has tested 7 261 clinical specimens from suspected EVD cases, of which 32.67% were positive by RT -PCR.

Dr Ngormbu Ballah, a Liberian medical doctor who is completing a Field Epidemiology Training Programme (FETP) in SA, returned to his country during July -August 2014. Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu was deployed in NICD contributes to the following aspects of EVD outbreak response in Sierra Leone: Provides assistance to the Sierra Leonean national laboratory counterparts, the WHO Country Office, and international response teams in the diagnosis of EVD. Provides adequate bio -hazard protection of staff working in the EMDF. Contributes to the improvement of the national Ebola diagnostic capacity. Provides technical assistance to the Government of Sierra Leone in controlling the EVD outbreak.

Both experts worked with the World Health Organization team while in Liberia. Dr Ihekweazu fed back on the challenges of contact tracing during the response. Contact tracing is the process of finding everyone who has come in direct contact with a sick Ebola patient. Contacts are monitored for signs of illness for 21 days from the last day they came in contact with the Ebola patient. If the contact develops a fever or other Ebola symptoms, they are immediately isolated, tested, provided care, and the cycle starts again - all of the new patient's contacts are found and watched for 21 days. In January 2015, 22 cases in the St. Paul Bridge cluster in Liberia led to about five hundred contacts who were followed every day for 21 days by the team. Contacts were urged to stay at home for 21 days. Ensuring the comfort of contacts during the 21 -day follow -up period was essential in achieving the isolation objectives. A major challenge was ensuring that all contacts received food and other essential commodities while at home. A complicating factor at this stage of the outbreak was the increasing number of suspected cases that turned out to be negative, but all of whom required isolation until testing was completed. During this period, the full public health response, including contact tracing, had to be instituted. The large number of contacts that required monitoring made paper -based questionnaires burdensome and impracticable. Making use of personal mobile phones for collection of data may be a more efficient solution for future contact tracing and outbreak control. Finally, while carrying out contact tracing and monitoring, a compassionate approach is required. It is important to remember that these contacts are indeed people that most likely suffered loss due to Ebola, and it would be unfair to expect them to behave in a completely rational way in such circumstances. Coordination of the numerous resources, in particular human capacity and the technical skills from different organisations with same mission and expertise, was a major task in itself.

Concluding remarks The ongoing and unprecedented Ebola outbreak in West Africa has resulted in one of the largest public health responses to an outbreak to date. These efforts far exceeded the borders of the countries reporting EVD cases, and have not only seen governments around the world putting measures in place to prevent introduction of EVD in to their countries, but also to be prepared to handle EVD cases if they should occur. As numbers of EVD cases are declining in the three most -affected 9 countries, the experts are calling the end game for the EVD outbreak. Nonetheless, efforts are required in the coming weeks and months to ensure that the final case of EVD during this outbreak can be concluded.

Surveillance was initially conducted in three of South Africa's provinces: Gauteng - Chris Hani -Baragwanath Hospital (CHBH) (this site stopped enrolling patients in December 2013 and was replaced by the Helen Joseph and Rahima Moosa hospital Complex (RMMCH/HJ) in Mapulaneng Hospitals (Matikwana/Mapulaneng). This programme has been described previously.1 Patients were enrolled based on standardised clinical case definitions (table 1). The programme initially focused on the detection of influenza, but included testing for other respiratory viruses and Streptococcus pneumoniae . In June 2010, Klerksdorp -Tshepong Hospital Complex (KTHC), North West Province, was included as a new site. At the same time, the case definition was expanded at KTHC and Edendale Hospital (enhanced surveillance sites) to include cases with severe respiratory illness irrespective of symptom duration, and patients with a clinician admission diagnosis of suspected tuberculosis (TB). This expanded case definition was termed severe respiratory illness (SRI). In 2012, the surveillance was further expanded at the two enhanced surveillance sites (Edendale and KTHC) to include expanded testing of specimens (naso - and oropharyngeal swabs and aspirates) for additional pathogens and collection of additional specimens (induced sputum and oral washes) from patients with SRI (table 2). Also in 2012, the NICD initiated a programme of systematic influenza -like illness (ILI) surveillance at public health clinics. Two primary health care clinics serviced by the two enhanced SRI surveillance sites (Edendale and KTHC) commenced systematically enrolling patients with ILI. Dedicated staff screened and enrolled patients from Monday to Friday each week. The Viral Watch sentinel surveillance programme, which started in 1984, was specifically designed to monitor influenza activity and has been fully described Guinea, in 2014: and observational study.

Whole blood specimens were collected in EDTA containing tubes. Oral washes and sputum were collected in universal containers. Following collection, upper respiratory and blood samples were kept at 4\u00b0C at the local laboratory, and were transported to the NICD on ice within 72 hours post -collection. Sputum samples were stored separately at -200C at the local laboratory before being transported to the NICD on dry ice on a weekly basis. One sputum sample was tested at the surveillance site laboratory for M. tuberculosis using GeneXpert and a second sample was tested at the NICD for M. tuberculosis by culture , as well as for PCP and bacterial pathogens by PCR (table 2). Detection of viral pathogens Respiratory specimens were tested by multiplex real - time reverse -transcription PCR assay for 10 respiratory viruses (influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus 1, 2 and 3; respiratory syncytial virus; enterovirus; metapneumovirus; adenovirus and rhinovirus). Influenza positive specimens were subtyped using the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) real-time reverse -transcription PCR protocol for characterisation of influenza pneumoniae identified by quantitative real -time PCR detecting the lytA gene from whole blood specimens. Detection of bacterial pathogens other than tuberculosis Induced sputum and nasopharyngeal samples were tested for M. pneumoniae , C. pneumoniae, Legionella spp. and B. pertussis. DNA was extracted from the clinical specimens and tested for bacterial pathogens by RT-PCR. A specimen was considered positive for M. pneumoniae if the MP181 target was detected (Ct<45), C. pneumoniae if the CP-Arg target was detected (Ct<45) and Legionella spp. if the Pan -Leg target was detected (Ct<45).6 A positive result for pertussis was obtained when a specimen was positive for IS481 and/ or ptxS1 genes.7 Blood specimens were tested using quantitative real -time PCR for the presence of pneumococcal DNA ( lytA For lytA testing, specimens with a lytA Ct-value <40 were considered positive.8 Detection of tuberculosis Tuberculosis testing at the site laboratory was based on the GeneXpert System (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) using the cartridge -based (Xpert) assay.9 Tuberculosis microscopy for acid -fast bacilli was conducted for some patients. All induced sputum specimens were also tested for M. tuberculosis by smear for acid -fast bacilli and culture in liquid media using BD Bactec MGIT 960 at the NICD. Positive cultures were identified as M. tuberculosis complex using Ziehl -Neelsen staining and antigen testing. Genotypic resistance to was tested was tested for on one or more of the following specimens from each patient - oral wash, naso/oropharyngeal sample and induced sputum. DNA was extracted from the clinical specimens using an automated DNA extraction system . Fungal load was determined using a quantitative real -time PCR targeting the region coding for the mitochondrial large subunit rRNA for P. jirovecii.11 All specimens with copy numbers >0 copies/\u00b5l were included as positive. These include both cases of infection and colonisation with P. jirovecii .

Firstly, for some patients HIV testing was requested by admitting physicians as part of clinical management. This included HIV enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing with confirmation by ELISA on a second specimen for patients 18 months of age, and qualitative HIV PCR testing for confirmation of HIV - infection status in children <18 months of age. Secondly, for consenting patients, linked anonymous HIV PCR testing for children <18 months of age or ELISA for patients >18 months of age was performed using a dried blood spot or whole blood specimen. Data management Data management was centralised at the NICD where laboratory, clinical and demographic data from enrolled patients were recorded on a Microsoft Access database. Ethical considerations The protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the University of the Witwatersrand and University of KwaZulu -Natal. Results Of the 3693 patients enrolled into the surveillance programme, 3561 had full data on case definition available, 1585 (45%) fitted the case definition of ILI, 1171 (33%) were diagnosed with SARI and 805 (23%) were diagnosed with SCRI. The demographic characteristics of patients enrolled into the programme are described in table 3. The number of samples tested for each of these groups of patients depended on the samples available and suitable for testing. The number of samples tested for each case definition and pathogen are detailed in figure 1.

HIV prevalence was highest in the SCRI group (522/723, 72%) and was highest in the 25 -44 age group across all case definitions 51/58, 88%; SCRI 313/337, 93% ) (figure 2).

The season was dominated by influenza A (H3N3) (46/74, 62%) followed by influenza B (25/74, 34%) and influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 (3/74, 4%). The season started in week 30 and continued through week 33. The peak detection rate was 26% in week 33 (figure 3). The detection rate for RSV was 11% (205/1689). The RSV season preceeded the influenza season, started in week 4 and continued through week 19. The peak detection rate of 52% was in week 10 (figure 4). Parainfluenza viruses 1 -3 were detected in 5% (98/1894) of samples and hMPV in 3% (56/1894) of samples. In the same group of patients S. pneumoniae was detected in 15% (212/1458) of blood samples (figure 5). Across these pathogens the highest number of cases were in the <5 age (34%). The case fatality ratio was highest for patients testing positive for S. pneumoniae 18/206 (9%), table 4.

Tuberculosis and PCP had no obvious seasonality (figures 7 and 8). The majority of samples that tested positive for tuberculosis were collected at the KTHC site (138/195, 71%) and were in the 25 to 44 year age group (113/223, 51%) (table 6). Of the 266 samples that tested positive for PCP, 108 (41%) were from nasophyngeal samples, 34 (13%) were oral washes and 124 (48%) were from sputum.

The overall detection rate for influenza was 13% (n=202). Excluding non -subtyped samples, 80% (156/195) 5% (9/195) were influenza A(H1N1) pdm09. There were no dual infections. Influenza positive samples were detected from week 19. The detection rate reached 10% in week 24 and remained above 10% until week 38 (figure 9). Of the 1557 samples tested, 71 (5%) tested positive for parainfluenza 1 -3, 63 (4%) for RSV and 49 (3%) for human metapneumovirus. Only RSV demonstrated a defined seasonality which preceded the influenza season. The detection rate for RSV rose above 10% in week 5, peaked in week 12 and remained above 10% until week 17 (figure 10). In the group of patients with ILI: 1% (16/1463) tested positive for B. pertussis, 0.5% (7/1460) for M. pneumoniae and 0.5% (7/1460) for C. pneumonia. The highest numbers of positive samples for B. pertussis were in the <5 and 25 to 44 year age groups. Similarly, in C. pneumonia the highest number of cases was in the <5 year age group. The highest number of cases of M. pneumonia was in the 5 to 14 year age group (table 7). There were no positive tests for Legionella spp. There was no seasonality for bacterial pathogens (figure 11).

A total of 1054 samples was tested for influenza; of these 515 (49%) tested positive for influenza. The season was dominated by influenza A(H3N2) in which 351/515 (68%) of samples tested positive for influenza A(H3N2), 19% tested positive for influenza B and 12% (64/515) tested positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.

The numbers of hospitalizations for pneumonia and influenza during the influenza season were compared to those for the periods preceding and following the season. During 2014 there were 672 598 consultations reported to the NICD through the respiratory morbidity data mining surveillance system. Of these, 29 558 (4%) were due to pneumonia or influenza (P&I) (International Classification of Diseases 10 codes J10 -18). There were 22 059 (75%) inpatients and 7499 (25%) outpatients with P&I discharge data. An increase in P&I consultations and admission was observed during the period with a higher number of seasonal influenza virus isolations reported to the Viral Watch, ILI and SARI surveillance programmes respectively (figures 13, 14, and cross reference figure 3; ILI influenza figure 9; ILI Viral Watch influenza figure 12). A second lower peak preceded the influenza season, corresponding to the circulation of respiratory syncytial virus (figures 13, 14 and cross reference figure 4; SARI viruses, figure 10; ILI viruses).

Madin -Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells were used for virus isolations and about 67% (50/75) were successful. Of the 50 influenza virus isolations obtained, 43 were from influenza A viruses and 7 from influenza B viruses. The majority of influenza A virus isolates (n= 35) were influenza A/H3N2 which dominated the season. Compared to the 3 previous seasons this represents a great success in the isolation of H3N2 viruses in cell cultures. Changes in the phenotypic characteristics of H3N2 viruses were reported by the WHO Collaborating Centres. The embryonic egg isolations attempted were not successful. On investigating the failure of isolates, it was established that the collaborating centres recently used slightly older chicken embryos than normally used. Antigenic characterization of influenza virus isolates Turkey red blood cells were used in the hemagglutination and hemagglutination inhibition assays to determine the antigenic reactivity of the influenza virus isolates. A total of 46 virus isolates could be characterised antigenically by hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) of which 70 % (32/46) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the influenza A(H3N2) viruses serotyped 69% (22/32) showed normal reactivity to the A/Texas/50/2012 vaccine strain reference antiserum. Five influenza A(H3N2) isolates reacted with a 2 -fold lower titre than the control or reference antiserum, 3 reacted with a 4 -fold lower titre and 2 with 8 -fold lower titres. All seven A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates showed normal reactivity to the corresponding reference antiserum. Seven influenza B virus isolates were characterized for reactivity to reference antisera raised against vaccine or reference antigens. F ive influenza B isolates reacted to the B/Yamagata lineage reference antisera of which 1 Figure 14: Numbers of admissions for pneumonia and influenza, as well as numbers of influenza positive viral isolates (Viral watch) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) positive isolates (SARI) by week, South Africa, 2014. 0100200300400500600700 0102030405060 Number of admissionsNumber of positive samples Epidemiologic week Influenza positive (SARI) RSV positive (SARI) P&I inpatientsNumber of admissions Number of positive samples 27 reacted with a 2 -fold lower titre. Two reacted with similar titres as the reference B/Victoria lineage strain. However, these 2 samples were collected outside of the influenza season from individuals with travel history. Genetic characterisation of influenza A (H3N2), A (H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B strains was carried out by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) genes. Lineages were identified by specific amino acid mutations relative to a designated reference strain as described by the WHO Vaccine Consultation Meeting team. Influenza A(H3N2) H3N2 HA gene sequences were generated from 35 clinical specimens selected from the 2014 season for both the ILI and SARI surveillance programs. All 2014 strains are within the genetic group 3 of the seven lineages (WHO CC, London) identified, specifically subgroup 3C.3. Subgroup 3C is characterised by the following amino acid mutations: Q33R, N145S and N278K relative to A/Perth/16/2009 as reference. One strain is in the sub -subgroup 3C.2a identified in February 2014 as one of two emerging lineages with low reactivity to the current vaccine The 2014 vaccine strain A/Texas/50/2012 is in subgroup 3C.1 (CDC nomenclature). The deduced amino acid alignment showing amino acid mutations compared to the A/ Perth/16/2009 reference strain. The neuraminidase (NA) gene was sequenced for 30 influenza A(H3N2) positive samples and 3/30 had the mutations Y155F and D251V which divide the subgroup 3C. Two sequences showed an additional mutation at position 315 (S>G). All viruses had the N402D mutation that results in the loss of a potential N -linked glycosylation site which, together with the S367N and K369T mutations, results in a shift in potential of the N - linked glycosylation site. In the 2014 season the HA gene from only 5 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 positive clinical samples was sequenced. Three of these samples were in subgroup 6B as compared to 2013 when it was in 6C. Subgroups 6B and 6C are acid mutations K163Q and A256T characterise subgroup 6B. Influenza B The HA1 region of the HA genes from a total of 7 clinical samples positive for influenza B was sequenced and characterised. No B/Victoria lineage strains were sequenced as those identified were from outside of South Africa's influenza season. B/Yamagata lineage Seven viruses sequenced belong to clade 2 of B/ Yamagata lineage viruses in reference to the B/ Florida/4/2006 strain. This is on the deduced amino acid alignments showing the identified amino acid changes and the following are characteristic of clade 2 to which the current vaccine strain belongs: R48K, P108A and T181A. Discussion The influenza season in South Africa in 2014 was predominated by influenza A(H3N2), followed by influenza B and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. The season started in week 22 at the ILI sites but the detection rate in the SARI programme only remained constantly above 10% from week 31. In 2014 some changes to the SARI surveillance programme were made - in particular the change of surveillance site in Gauteng Province. As a result of this the total numbers of samples tested for 2014 were slightly lower than previous years. Other commonly detected pathogens in patients with pneumonia were pneumococcus, tuberculosis, RSV and PCP. Atypical bacterial pathogens and B. pertussis were detected in <5% of individuals. However, an increase in C O M M U N I C A B L E D I S E A S E S S U R V E I L L A N C E B U L L E T I N V O L U M E 1 3 , N O . 1 28 B. pertussis cases was observed in July and August of 2014, followed by a reduction in case numbers without any specific intervention. The increase was investigated and contamination was excluded. The increase likely reflects winter seasonality and disease periodicity which has been reported in some countries. 12,13 A full assessment of this observation is difficult as systematic surveillance for pertusiss has only been implemented since 2012 and baseline data on pertussis epidemiology from South Africa are limited.14,15 Ongoing systematic pertussis surveillance is needed to provide robust baseline data on disease burden and epidemiology and to monitor for future increases in disease. The most commonly identified pathogens in patients with ILI were influenza and RSV. A total of 115 A(H3N2) positive clinical samples, mainly from patients with ILI, were tested for the presence of the E119V mutation associated with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir by real-time RT -PCR. Only the wild -type E119 variant was detected in all samples. Representative cell culture and egg isolates as well as clinical samples were sent to the WHO Collaborating Centres in London and Australia for further characterisation. The CRDM is working towards comprehensive surveillance for the clinical syndromes of ILI and pneumonia. This is the first report to combine the viral pathogens with the additional testing for bacterial pathogens and some of the atypical causes of pneumonia in our setting. Additional work is being done on the interaction between these pathogens and the risk factors for severe disease which will assist clinicians and policy makers to improve health care and implement prevention strategies such as vaccines.

South Afr J Epidemiol Infect 2014; 28(4):202 -6. 30 Background Sentinel site surveillance of transmitted HIV drug resistance (TDR) is recommended by the World Health Organization to assess levels of transmitted resistance among recently infected populations within a country or region. Results from the analysis of specimens collected as part of the 2012 National Antenatal Sentinel HIV & Herpes Simplex Type -2 Prevalence Survey in South Africa are reported.1 In the survey, national HIV prevalence among antenatal women was estimated at 29.5%. Previously published TDR estimates from two provinces (Gauteng and KwaZulu -Natal) indicated that while TDR was low prior to 2008, these levels were moderate (>5%) in KwaZulu -Natal in 2009 -2011.2 Methods Remnant serum specimens were obtained from primagravid HIV -infected women <21 years of age attending any one of 1497 sentinel primary health care clinics in all 9 provinces (table 1). Genotyping was performed by sequencing the protease and reverse transcriptase genes using population sequencing methodologies. Mutations were interpreted using CPR v6.0 (http://cpr.stanford.edu/), which analyses data according to the 2009 Surveillance of Drug Resistance Mutations (SDRM) list.3 For drug level testing (DLT), a semi -quantitative Liquid Chromatography MS/MS method was used to screen serum samples for the presence of various antiretroviral drugs (AZT, EFV, FTC, LPV, NVP, TNF). Specificity was ensured by the use of deuterated internal standards for all analytes. Point prevalence estimates of TDR levels with 95% CI were calculated using STATA. National estimates were weighted by number of eligible specimens in each province as a contribution to the total survey.

From this, 97 had insufficient volume for testing. Of 789 available specimens, 542 were successfully amplified and sequenced. Three sequences were excluded due to unresolved phylogenetic linkage. Thirty nine sequences had SDRMs, of which 36 had sufficient volume to be tested for antiretroviral therapy drug levels, as well as a sample set of 77 specimens that were not amplifiable by PCR. Four (11%) specimens with SDRMs and 12 (16%) no-amps were positive for detection of drug levels, indicating recent drug exposure in these women. All 16 specimens positive for DLT were removed from further analysis. From the remaining 770 specimens included, 532 (81%) were genotyped. The majority of specimens (99%) clustered with Subtype C; 5 specimens were found to be non-C. No regional clustering of sequences was noted. National TDR point prevalence was estimated at 5.3% (95% CI 3.7 - 7.5%) for the non -nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) drug class, 1.1% (95% reverse and 0.6% (95% CI 0.1 - 1.6%) for protease inhibitors (PI) (table 2). Four provinces had NNRTI point prevalence estimates >5%, and 1 province had a PI point prevalence estimate of >5%, although most provincial analyses were limited by small sample sizes. The predominant mutations detected were K103N (57%), V106M (23%) and mutation (9%). Two specimens had dual NNRTI and NRTI class resistance.

They indicate that levels of TDR are low to moderate for the NNRTI drug class and are low for NRTI and PI. The detection of antiretroviral drugs in women epidemiologically predicted to be recently infected suggests that screening criteria for inclusion in TDR surveys are less reliable in countries such as South Africa with a mature epidemic and an extensive ARV treatment program. Future analysis should include the use of testing algorithms for recent infection to exclude women who are chronically infected. Efforts should be intensified in -country to review sources of resistance including assessing early warning indicator data and monitor levels of acquired drug resistance in treated populations.

C O M M U N I C A B L E D I S E A S E S S U R V E I L L A N C E B U L L E T I N V O L U M E 1 3 , N O . 1 Introduction Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a key public health concern that threatens effective treatment of severe infections, both locally and globally. Surveillance is conducted to determine the extent and pattern of resistance amongst the most important pathogens causing infections in humans.1 Integrated data on resistance in bacteria are obtained from electronic reports generated by public laboratories in South Africa. The objectives of the AMR surveillance programme are to determine the number of cases reported from selected hospitals by month for selected pathogens and to describe antimicrobial susceptibility to the most important treatment regimens by pathogen and by hospital. Methods All data for this report were sourced from the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW). This is a national repository for laboratories serving all public health hospitals in South Africa and contains archived data from two laboratory information systems (LISs), either DISA or TrakCare.2 Bloodstream infections over the period January - December 2014 were extracted for the following References 1.

Routine electronic data were collected from sentinel sites (mostly tertiary academic hospitals) (table 1). Due to two different LISs, each with its own coding system for organisms and antibiotics, as well as a lack of standardisation across NHLS laboratories on how data were captured, extensive cleaning and recoding of data was necessary. Cleaning of the data involved creating unique patient identifiers, which enabled de - duplication and the generation of patient -level data. Antimicrobial susceptibility reporting was based on Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.3 The various laboratory methods used included Microscan, Vitek, E test and disk diffusion. Vancomycin resistance is not reported for Staphylococcus aureus due to the lack of confirmatory test methods (pending agreement with the South African Society for Clinical Microbiology (SASCM)). Data were omitted for those sites that tested fewer than 30 organisms for a particular antibiotic.

For each organism, the total number of cases, as well as their susceptibility profiles and percentage susceptibility to selected antimicrobial agents by site were analysed (figures 1 -8). 34 Acinetobacter baumannii complex Acinetobacter baumannii was resistant to most of the antimicrobial agents tested. This is due to its ability to harbour multiple mechanisms of resistance, such as the loss of outer membrane porins resulting in reduced permeability, efflux systems, ampC -lactamases and others. The proportions of isolates resistant to imipenem, cefepime and ceftazidime were high at 77%, 79% and respectively, whereas resistance proportions were ciprofloxacin, 43% to amikacin and 51% to tobramycin. Resistance to colistin was estimated to be 5%. Resistance to most agents have not changed in comparison with the previous year, except for the increase in resistance to tobramycin and colistin. AST testing and breakpoints for colistin are lacking and these results should be treated with caution.

Total number of isolates analyzed =1228. 35 Enterobacter cloacae complex The high level of Enterobacter cloacae complex isolates resistant to ertapenem (12%) should be taken with reservation (refer to the limitations discussed earlier), although resistance to imipenem and meropenem has remained stable (2%). Resistance to cefepime (35%) is indicative of ampC -lactam ase hyper -production in combination with porin loss, which may confer resistance to cephalosporins.

Total number of isolates analyzed = 566. 36 Enterococcus faecalis Enterococcus exhibited 17% resistance to penicillins and 2% (non -confirmed) resistance to vancomycin. There were no significant changes in comparison to the previous year. Results obtained from phenotypic methods for linezolid -intermediate or resistant Enterococcus spp. should be interpreted with caution since the gold standard for confirmation and quantification of linezolid resistance in enterocci is detection of the G2576T mutation.

Total number of isolates analyzed = 705. 37 Enterococcus faecium Enterococcus faecium is inherently resistant to -lactam agents. There was a decrease in resistance to vancomycin from 13% in 2013 to 5% in 2014, which may be explained by the containment of outbreaks in a few hospitals.

Total number of isolates analyzed = 726. 38 Escherichia coli Escherichia coli showed a minor increase in resistance to almost all -lactams, whereas no change in resistance to ciprofloxacin over a two -year period was noted. Resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins indicates the presence of extended spectrum - lactamases (ESBLs) and was recorded in 25% of all isolates. C O M M U N I C A B L E D I S E A S E S S U R V E I L L A N C E B U L L E T I N V O L U M E 1 3 , N O . 1 Figure 5: Escherichia coli cases by month, and numbers and percentages of susceptible and resistant E. coli isolates from blood cultures at public -sector sentinel sites, 2014. Total number of isolates analyzed = 1580. 39 Klebsiella pneumoniae Klebsiella pneumoniae was resistant to multiple antimicrobials, including 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporinsthat indicate (70%), ciprofloxacin (39%) and (48%). The proportion of isolates resistant to ertapenem was low. Although resistance to other carbapenems was low, the rapid emergence of strains with carbapenemase production threatens the efficacy and use of this class of antimicrobials as a therapeutic option. Thus, continuous monitoring of resistance needs to be implemented. In hospitals where resistance is 10%, a nosocomial outbreak should be considered and investigated.

Total number of isolates analyzed = 2152. 40 Pseudomonas aeruginosa Compared to A. baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates displayed greater susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents tested. Resistance to piperacillin - tazobactam was high at 33%. There appeared to be modest decrease in resistance in 2014 compared to 2013 for the majority of antimicrobial agents, which may be explained by reasons listed in the limitations. Colistin resistance was the lowest.

Total number of isolates analyzed = 502. 41 Staphylococcus aureus Nine S. aureus isolates were reported to be vancomycin resistant. However, this was not confirmed and these data should be treated with caution as vancomycin resistance is exceptionally rare. Confirmatory phenotypic gold standard methods are available internationally and should be performed on each isolate flagged as resistant. Resistance to methicillin/oxacillin and all other -lactams have decreased compared to the previous year. Cefoxitin resistance indicated methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Resistances to erythromycin and clindamycin have marginally decreased compared to 2013.

Few organisms presented with more than one carbapenemase gene.

Data may be incomplete due to missing cases not captured on the LIS or non -standardised coding of pathogens and antibiotics. Testing methods and microbiological practice vary between sites and this could account for variation in the results presented. Confirmatory antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) methods were not performed for any of these organisms and results presented here are reported as captured on the LIS. Thus, while some results may suggest the occurrence of an outbreak, it is not possible to confirm this. For certain sites, not all organisms are represented. This may be due to organisms not being identified at a particular site for 2014. Nevertheless, the data presented in this report highlight the importance of surveillance for antimicrobial resistance patterns. Active surveillance needs to be ongoing in order to identify trends as well as possible outbreaks. Table 2: Numbers of confirmed carbapenemase -producing Enterobactericeae by species and genoptype.

Provinces of South Africa: EC - Eastern Cape, FS - Free State, GA - Gauteng, KZ - KwaZulu -Natal, LP - Limpopo, MP - Mpumalanga, NC - Northern Cape, NW - North West, WC - Western Cape Monitoring for the presence of polio in a country is based on AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) surveillance - the hallmark clinical ex- pression of paralytic poliomyelitis. The clinical case definition of AFP is an acute onset of flaccid paralysis or paresis in a ny child under 15 years of age. AFP is a statutory notifiable disease and requires that 2 adequate stool specimens are taken as soon a s possible, 24 to 48 hours apart, but within 14 days after onset of paralysis, for isolation and characterisation of polio vir us. The differential diagnosis of AFP is wide, the most common cause of which is Guillain -Barre Syndrome. The incidence of AFP in a population has been studied in a number of developing countries and WHO have determined, as a result of these studies, that the criterion for adequate surveillance of AFP is 2 cases per 100 000 population of children less than 15 years of age (it wa s for- merly 1 per 100,000 but this was thought to be inadequately sensitive).
