I've been meditating since 2006. I'm not entirely sure why I started meditating, but I think I was hoping to become a better version of myself. That sort-of happened\u2014I do find that I can work with challenges with more acceptance and much less overwhelm\u2014but the best gift my meditation practice has offered to me is the capacity to be present. To see things as they are. Life can be painful, but it can also be profoundly beautiful. I'm often in a state of awe, and that awe shines even brighter because I take the time to meditate daily. If you would like to join me in a deeper connection with the wonder and the deep mysteries of life, I would love to invite you to meditate with me.
