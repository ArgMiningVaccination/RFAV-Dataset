Introduction Natural healing uses the philosophy of naturopathy with a focus on a nature-orientated healthy life style. Naturallyhealing methods are also applied in the therapy of disor-ders and in rehabilitation. They are used in self-care oftenrecommended by nonmedicals and medical practitioners in ambulantsettings.Therearealsospecialclinics,hospitalsfor inhouse treatments. We present the historical developmentof naturopathy with focus on inpatient natural healing withregard to present and future statuses. The asclepion of theancient Greek temple facilities might be referred to as anearly precursor of inpatient treatment with a programmesimilar in many aspects to that of contemporary naturalhealing. Apart from the medicinal water applications adormitorium was also in use for inducing a healing sleep\u2014some similarity might be seen with modern meditation[1]. A dogmatically independent and new development con- trary to the medicine of the time [ 2]w a sc o n s t i t u t e da s late as the beginning of the 19th century; but the namefor this programme was initially hydropathy or in German \"Wasserheilkunde.\" However, in the 18th century there wasalreadyanincreasedinterestinmedicinewithaviewtowardsmild hippocratic approaches of healing, inclusive internaland external water applications, healthy food and physicalexercises,andavoidanceofdangerousandrigorousinterven-tions; all this was related sporadically to the term \"medicinanaturae\"[ 3]. The hydropathic movement developed and was driven mainly by medical laymen [ 4]. About the mid 18th century, this romantic hydropathical movement changed its name toamorepositiveterm,thatis,\"Naturheilkunde\"(naturopathy,art of natural healing). Exercise, nutrition, and later othernatural healing methods like herbal therapy were added tocoldwater.Naturaltreatmentswereprovidedbymedicalandnonmedicalhealers as well as in self-help groupsin both in-andoutpatientsettings.Thiswasincontrasttotheestablishedmedical services\u2014the conventional balneology is included,withitsfocusonspecialandlocallyavailablespatreatments.During the second half of the 19th century spas or hospitalsspecializinginnaturalhealingdevelopedworldwide. 2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine The books and quarterly water journal of Eucharius Ferdinand Christian Oertel (1765-1851) and also his firstassociation with hydropathic health were important for thedogmaticandmedicinehostiledevelopment.Similartoothersystems and disciplines of complementary medicine a verybroadsupportofthepopulationwasthereasonforitsgrowth despitestakeholdersinmedicineandgovernments.

Methods The content of this relies on the literature reviewin AR96 (Deutsches (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials),CDAR94 (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects),CDSR93 (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews),CV72 (CAB (with case insensitivity). The searches produced4 8 ,r e s p e c t i v e l y ,8 9 ,t o g e t h e r1 3 7h i t s .A ft e re l i m i n a t i o no fdouble or multiple hits of the same source 85 hits remained.39 papers were excluded from further evaluation becausethey did not examine the naturopathic inpatient treatmentaccording to their titles and abstracts. Another 25 sourceswere excluded by full-text analysis for the same reason orbecause they were only concerned with the naturopathicinpatient treatment of a special condition or disease. The remaining 11 papers, supplemented by own additional literature, which included already 9 of the 11 papers foundby the systematic search, were used to elaborate the contentof this paper. A previous published historical review of thedevelopment of naturopathic inpatient treatment was notfound. 3. First Naturopathic Inpatient Facilities The first and famous cold-water establishment was devel-oped by the farmer Vinzenz Prie\u00dfnitz in 5]. Prie\u00dfnitz opened his cold-water spa in 1822. He treated 45 patients in 1829, 500patients in 1837, and two years later there were already 1700patients, among them 120 physicians. The diagnoses of hisp a t i e n t sd u r i n gt h ey e a r s1 8 2 9t o1 8 3 9a r ea n a l y s e da n ddescriptivelyreportedbySajnerandK r\u00b4zek[6]. Some time later, hydrotherapy was extended by certain forms of nutrition therapy. Johann Schroth (1798-1856), aschoolfellow of Prie\u00dfnitz, was striving for the concept of thePrie\u00dfnitz's water establishments and founded his own cure establishment in the nearby Niederlindewiese, where, alongwith warm water applications, he introduced a fasting curewith alternative days of drinking large amounts of wine orwater fluid and days without drinking at all [ 7]. Later on, ideas of vegetarianism were incorporated in the movement ofnaturopathy. The term \"Naturheilkunde\" (naturopathy) was initially introducedbytheforestgeometerJ .H.RaussealiasHeinrichF. Francke (1805-1848). Later the Bavarian physician Lorenz Gleich (1798-1865),a radical representative of hydropathy and naturopathy andin strong opposition to conventional medicine [ 8,9]. He could also accommodate some patients in and alongside hishydropathical facility in the south of Munich. Apart fromhydrotherapy,therewerealsonutritionandphysicalexercisetherapiesapplied. The further development included a systematic use of light, air, and the sun introduced by the so-called \"sun-apostle\"[10],ArnoldRikli(1823-1906)[ 11]andlateronbythe open-airfanatic,AdolfJust(1859-1936)[ 12].Theyappliedthe wholespectrumofthenaturalcurefactorsintheirair-cottageparks:AdolfJustistodayknownasarediscovererofinternalandexternaltreatmentswith\"Heilerde\"(healingclay)[ 4]. Hydropathical-orientatednaturopathycouldnotdevelop widely accepted level until the 1870s,withanexceptionofabroadactivemovementofnaturopathyin Saxony, where the physician Heinrich Lahmann (1860-1905) resumed the leadership of Zimmermann's notableestablishment of true naturopathy in Chemnitz in 1886. However, two years later Bergmann opened his own facility fornaturopathy(Wei\u00dferHirsch)nearDresden. 4. The Kneipp Movement A true renaissance of naturopathy all-over Germany andbeyond started with the Catholic priest Sebastian Kneipp(1821-1897). His bestseller \"My Water Cure\" (1886) wasintended to reduce personal provision of the treatment.H o w e v e r ,t h eo p p o s i t eh a p p e n e d( i n1 8 8 9o v e r2 , 6 0 0 ,1 8 9 2over 12,000 patients in W \u00a8orishofen). Using donations by his patients, Kneipp established several hospitals \"Sebas-tianeum,\" \"Kneipp's healing facility for children\", and the\"Kneippianum.\" The last was managed like a hospital bythe Kneipp physician Alfred Baumgarten (1862-1924) who startedin1894. The first Kneipp association was established in W\u00a8orishofen in 1891 and later named \"Stamm-Kneipp- Verein\" (Original Kneipp Society). The development of other local societies followed rapidly. The \"Verein der \u00a8Arzte establishedin1894. his recommendation of a much shorter cold water stimulus,which led to a better initial reaction and better long-termresults. Kneipp introduced affusions (from a watering canwithout sprinkling head or from a wide mouthed rubberEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 3 tube). Kneipp did not only\u2014as could be assumed from the title of his book \"My Water Cure\"\u2014focus on hydrotherapy(Part1ofhisbook),butalsocombinedhiswatertherapywithherbal medicine. This was heavily criticised by other hydro-therapists and naturopathists, while they assumed a \"badcompromise\" that would detract patients from their strict self-healing process and soften the cure too much. Addi- tionally, Kneipp combined water and herbs with exercise,diet,andguidelinestohealthyandhappylife,speciallyinhisfurtherbooks\"ThusShaltThouLive\"(1889)and\"MyWillforHealthy and Sick\" (1894). Diseases were described very simply and clearly: they originate either because of dysfunction of blood compositesorcirculatorydisturbance.Accordingly,atherapysucceededdue to liquidation of obstruction or here of aroused harmfulsubstances and their discharge and secretion.

The skilled weaver was againstwoollen clothes touching skin directly and preferred linenbecause of its rub effect. A fresh and unspoiled air wasimportantaswell. The \"five columns,\" which nowadays are accredited to Kneipp, do not originate directly from him. They are for-mulated after 1950 by the Kneipp physician Josef H. Kaiser,and they include water, nutrition, physical exercise, herbaltreatments, and \"Ordnung\" (balance of life or today: mind andbody). Kneippwasatthetimereluctantlynoticedbytheconven- tional academically minded medical establishment and, forexample, ignored by Wilhelm Winternitz (1834-1917), whoconsidered himself a successor of the long, since deceased,Prie\u00dfnitz. He was also looked down upon by Ferdinand v.Ziemssen of Munich hospital. In fact the academic writingsofProfessorWinternitzfrom1877nevergarneredsuchpublicattentionasthebooksofthe\"simple\"priest. In 1889, the Jordan bath\u2014the first Kneipp bath outside W\u00a8orishofen\u2014was opened under leadership of Dr. Johann Nepomuk St \u00a8utzle (1858-1938). Though numerous Kneipp establishments were founded, only some of them are still inoperationliketheoneatBrixen(nowItaly),foundedin1890byOttoV.Guggenberg(1848-1914). Another core area of naturopathy was Dresden and Saxony. The physician Paul Kadner (1818-1868) had openedt h efi r s td i e tc u r ee s t a b l i s h m e n tw h i c hh a d2 0b e d sa se a r l yas 1861. Later his brother-in-law Felix Klees (1832-1899)continued with focus on the Schroth cure. The physicianHeinrich Lahmann (1860-1905), who served as head of abig naturopathic facility in Chemnitz before, established theleading sanatorium in the spa town Wei\u00dfer Hirsch at Dres-den. Over 2000 patients were treated there in 1900. Several other health hospitals were situated in the neighbourhood and in the area around Dresden, part of which operatingundercontrolofphysicians[ 13]. At the turn of century, greater political pressure was exerteduponmedicinetousenaturopathytoagreaterextent.This appeared under the newly established branch of med- ical science \"physical-dietary medicine\" which ranged fromhydrotherapy, massage, and remedial gymnastics to diet.NeitherthemedicinalherbsintroducedbyKneippnorsomefurther specific ideas and treatments of naturopathy wererecognizedbythemedicalapproach. 5. First Academic Naturopathy ErnstSchweninger(1850-1924)[ 14,15]wasappointedprofes- sorfordermatologyafterhissuccessfultreatmentofBismarckin1884-1900,andduring1900-1906,hewasheadofthefirstGermanhospitalofnaturopathyinBerlin-Gro\u00df-LichterfeldeassociatedwiththeCharit \u00b4e[16]. Schweningertreated8,359patientsinGro\u00df-Lichterfelde, administering 262, 118 treatment days. Among those therewere 479 consumptive patients (i.e. mainly tuberculosis),264 acute joint-rheumatic patients, 219 gastro patients, 210diphtheria cases, 165 scarlatina cases, 155 heart cases, 129 cases, 113 eczema cases, 104pneumoniacases,72redmurraincases,45rubeolacases,34 psoriasiscases,27typhuscases,and16pertussiscases[ 17].

Additionally, since 1901, there existed a hydrotherapic facilityattheCharit \u00b4eunderProfessorLudwigBrieger(1849- 1919), who later also held the chair for general therapy [ 18].

At the time, thisconsisted of a polyclinic with surgeries and a small hospitaldepartmentwithjust20beds.25,000patientsweremedicatedwithin nine years. Most were from a poverty stricken back-ground from the north of Berlin.

In 1924, a second university department for naturopathy wasopenedattheFriedrich-SchillerUniversityinJena.ErnstKlein[21]wasthefirstprofessorfornaturopathy. The first teaching hospital of naturopathy with 75 beds, the Prie\u00dfnitz hospital in Berlin Mahlow, was establishedin 1927 and affiliated with the natural healing departmentof Professor Sch \u00a8onenberger. The public acceptance was so great that the patients waited several months for admission.4 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine The therapeutic measures described by Brauchle [ 18] included uncooked vegetarian food according to Bircher-Benner(1867-1939)[ 22],coldwaterhydrotherapyaccording to Prie\u00dfnitz and Kneipp, warm applications according toSchweninger, and air and sun baths according to Rikli[10,11]a n dL a h m a n n[ 23], as well as the Schroth cure in a moderate variant. Additionally, the fasting cure, massage, and gymnastics played a significant role. The successor wasAlfred Brauchle (1898-1964) who stayed there until he leftforDresden. 6. ''New German Medicine'' Naturopathy was abused under the state dictatorship ofnational socialism during the third Reich and was part ofthe intended \"New German Medicine.\" Different medicalareas such as naturopathy, homeopathy, and biochemistryby Sch\u00a8u\u00dfler, the last mostly due to the impressive number of members in the nonmedical societies, were put togetherunder \"biological methods.\" The anthroposophy was, how-ever,labelledas\"degenerated\"andforbidden. Ernst Klein in Jena was dismissed in 1933. The successor ofKleinwasthepartypoliticallyactiveKarlK \u00a8otschau(1892- 1945). The department of true naturopathy at the Univer-sity of Jena was transformed under his leadership from apolyclinic for naturally healing systems into the \"Clinic andPolyclinicforBiologicalMedicine\"[ 24].

Louis Redcliff Grote (1886-1960) wasnominated as the head of the hospital for internal medicinewithabout300beds.Inparallel,thehospitalfornaturopathywas subordinated to Brauchle and comprised after its exten-sionabout250beds[ 25,26]. Hydrotherapy, massage and gymnastics, and air and sun baths, as well as the upcoming psychotherapy (according toCou\u00b4e und Wetterstrand) were applied in Brauchle's Depart- ment. Clinical visits were arranged during daily air baths. Regular meetings of medical staff were held. They were therapeutically supervised by a physician of the ward of thetrue naturopathic department and assisted by an internistassigned for diagnostic advisory [ 18,27]. Both departments haddailyrotatingadmissionshifts.Thepeopletreatedrangedfrom patients with internal diseases as well as patients ofconservative gynecology, orthopedics, neurology, and der-matology.Brauchle andGrote performedassociated visitsatthecommonwardwhichwasthecoreplaceforcriticaldialogsregardingspecificcases.

According to Krau\u00df [ 27] the duration of stay in the hos- pital for true naturopathy lasted 22 days, in the departmentof Grote 21 days. The average costs of medication were 35Pfennig per day at Grote and between 4-6 Pfennig per dayatBrauchle(skinoilsandherbalteasincluded). The difference of total costs was due to different usage of medication, number of nurses, and therapeutic staff. Itwas also dependent on complexity of laboratory-technicalwork.Nodocumentationofdailypersonnelcostsduringthe\"experiment of Dresden\", which reassesses the methods ofnaturopathy[ 28],isavailable. In accordance with the political development Brauchle elaborated at the beginning of the forties his psychologicalcollectivetreatmentintoaformofmasssuggestion(\"Massen-suggestion\")[ 29]. DeathwasdeclaredbyBrauchleas\"bestcure\"forpatients when naturopathic methods could not help them [ 28]\u2014a cynicalpointofview. After 1942, the deteriorating general situation during the second world war stopped the harmonic cooperation ofBrauchleandGrote[ 30]. The occupation of naturopathy by national socialism recharged the beginning of academic recognition which naturopathy gained at 1920 (chair for naturopathy at thecharit\u00b4e) and 1924 (chair for naturopathy at the Friedrich- SchillerUniversityJena)[ 31]. A number of naturopathic departments and Kneipp's departmentsatmunicipalhospitalswere,however,operatingfurther up to 50s or 60s when new techniques and newspecificmedicationreplacedthem. 7.

Naturopathy is mostly applied by practitioners in the ambulantsector,withabout20.000physiciansspecializedinnaturalhealingandabout15.000nonmedicalpractitionersinGermany.

Theunionofassociatedhospitalsofthe\"Munichmodel,\" established in 1993, was supported by the Bavarian Ministryof Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Public Health andoperated in the first instance until 1999 [ 43]. The union of hospitals was enlarged by the Dr. K \u00a8ohler-Parkkliniken, Bad Elster(Saxony)hospitalin1997(since2004:GermanHospitalfor Integrative Medicine and Natural Healing).

In 2005, a further scientific monitoring in associationwithuniversityhospitalsoftheRuhrUniversityofBochum was implemented to perform an interhospital com-parisonofnaturopathicandconventionalinpatienttreatment[40]. The running third scientific monitoring concerns the sustainability of the achieved progress of the inpatient stay.Th e\" O r d n u n g st h e r a p y \"i sas u b j e c to ft h eev a l u a t i o n .I na ninterhospital comparison in the Ruhr area Department\"Hospital for 41].

Evaluation of Naturopathy in History Different ways to describe and evaluate naturopathic treat- mentinhistoryuptonowaredelineatedin Table 2. Though naturopathy and conventional medicine were directlycompared\"sidebyside\"alreadyinthethirtiesofthelast century at Dresden, the published results are academicconversations but no comparable physical or psychologicalmeasurements[ 25,26].Comparisonofnaturopathyandcon- ventional medicine remains difficult. Only one study existswhich compares treatment results between naturopathicand conventional orthopaedic, respectively, rheumatologictreatment[ 46].Becausethisstudycouldnotrandomlyassign the patients to the treatment groups, interpretation of theresults is difficult. Nevertheless naturopathy seems to be atl e a s ta se ff e c t i v ea sc o n v e n t i o n a lo r t h o p a e d i c ,r e s p e c t i v e l y ,rheumatologic treatment. All other modern studies evalu-ating naturopathic treatment on the whole are one-armedcohortstudieswithoutcontrolgroup. 9. Discussion and Conclusions Naturopathic hospitals have always tried to evaluate theirresults. Outcome research was a central issue of inpatientnaturopathictreatment.Kusche [ 16] already compared costs of patient-centered healthcarelike\"integrierteVersorgung\"inGermanyempha- size and underline the importance of this type of research.Newer studies use standardized questionnaires to measuretheeffectsofnaturopathicinpatienttreatment[ 36-41]allow- ing for more objective measurement of effects in outcomeresearch. Only one modern study was able to comparenaturopathicinpatienttreatmentwithconventionalminimalinvasiveorthopedic,respectively,rheumatologictreatment.The future development of the inpatient treatment with naturopathy in Germany is uncertain at this time, espe-cially due to discussions on the Law on Modernization of Public Health and decreasing financial resources in public health sector. Also the adopted system of case allowances(DRG-System)complicatestheaccountingofnaturalhealingtreatments in the hospital. The classical naturally healingsystems propose ideal prerequisites for prevention and com-plementary treatment of numerous diseases.
