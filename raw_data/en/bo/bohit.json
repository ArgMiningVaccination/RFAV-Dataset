[Get the Department of Health (DH) report [pdf]](http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_124338.pdf) It is not good news. They have opted for statutory regulation by the Health Professions Council (HPC). This is much what was recommended by the disgraceful [Pittilo report](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Pittilo), about which I wrote a [commentary in the Times](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/law/columnists/article2047617.ece) (or [free version here](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=251)), and [A very bad report: gamma minus for the vice-chancellor](http://dcscience.net/?p=235). The DH report is merely an analysis of responses to the consultation, but the [MHRA says](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Howweregulate/Medicines/Medicinesregulatorynews/CON108795) \"The Health Professions Council (HPC) has now been asked to establish a statutory register for practitioners supplying unlicensed herbal medicines. The proposal is, following creation of this register, to make use of a derogation in European medicines legislation (Article 5 (1) of Directive 2001/83/EC) that allows national arrangements to permit those designated as \"authorised healthcare professionals\" to commission unlicensed medicines to meet the special needs of their patients.\" The MHRA points out that this started 11 years ago with the publication of the [ House of Lords report (2000)](http://dcscience.net/?p=199). Both that report, and the government's response to it, set the following priorities. Both state clearly \"... we recommend that three important questions should be addressed in the following order . . - (1) does the treatment offer therapeutic benefits greater than placebo? - (2) is the treatment safe? - (3) how does it compare, in medical outcome and cost-effectiveness, with other forms of treatment? The report of DH and the MHRA's response have ignored totally two of these three requirements. There is no consideration whatsoever of whether treatments work better than placebo (point one) and there is no consideration whatsoever of cost-effectiveness (point 3). These two important recommendations in the Houss of Lords report have simply been brushed under the carpet. Needless to say, herbalists are head over heels with joy at this sign of official endorsement (here is [one reaction](http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=312229)) Here are my first reactions. The post will be updated soon. The DH report is, in a sense, democratic. They have simply counted the responses, for and against each proposal. They seem to be quite unaware that most of the responses come from High Street herbailsts whose main aim is to gain respectability. The response of the Academy of Royal Medical Colleges counts as one vote, just the same as the owner of a Chinese medicine shop. This is not how health policy should be determined. Some intervention of the brain is needed, but that isn't apparent in the report. At present [the HPC regulates](http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/professions/) Arts therapists, biomedical scientists, chiropodists/podiatrists, clinical scientists, dietitians, occupational therapists, operating department practitioners, orthoptists, paramedics, physiotherapists, prosthetists/orthotists, radiographers and speech & language therapists. I shudder to think what all these good people will think about being lumped together with people who practice evidence-free medicine (or, worse, forms of medicine where there is good evidence that they don't work). The vast majority of herbalists, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and acupuncture has no good evidence that it works, In the case of soem herbal medicines and acupuncture, there is good evidence that they don't work. Yet the HPC has, as [one of its criteria](http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/newprofessions/criteria/), that aspiring to be regulated by them requires \"practise based on evidence of efficacy\" The Department of Health seems to have quietly forgotten about this criterion. It cannot possibly be met. The HPC has already expressed its willingness to go along with this two-faced approach (see [Health Professions Council ignores its own rules: the result is nonsense](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1284) ) Another mistake made by the Department of Health regards the value of \"training\". The report (page 11) says Would statutory regulation lessen the risk of harm? (Q2) Again, the vast majority of respondents thought it would. Reasons given were that statutory regulation would ensure that herbal practitioners and acupuncturists are carefully and thoroughly trained. That training is subject to accreditation, evaluation and periodic review by independent educational and training professionals, and disciplinary oversight by a regulating body. Incompetent or unscrupulous practitioners could be struck off the register and prevented from practising. Although it is pointed out to them in several responses, the Department of Health seems quite incapable of understanding a simple and obvious truth. Spending three years training people to learn things that are not true, safeguards nobody. On the contrary, it endangers the public. Training in nonsense is obviously a nonsense. At the end of the report is a list of organisations who responded, As expected, they are predominantly trade bodies that have a vested interest in allowing thinks to be sold freely regardless of whether they work or not. The first four are Alliance of Herbal Medicine Practitioners. European herbal and Traditional Medicine Practitioners Association (ETMPA), Association Chinese Medicine Practitioners (UK) (ACMP) and Acupuncture Society. And so on. More coming soon. Follow-up 16 February 2011. Later the same day, we see one reason why Michael Mcintyre, chair of the European Herbal Practitioners Association, got what he wanted to promote his trade. They had evidently hired a PR Agency, Cogitamus, to push their case. Now they are [ crowing about their victory](http://www.cogitamus.co.uk/?p=290). And of course his profits were not harmed by the free publicity that was given to his cause [ by the BBC](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2813), The pinheads in the Department of Health are more easily persuaded by a PR agency than by any number of people who know a lot more about it, and who have no profit motive. 17 February 2011. The herbal problem was front page news in the London free paper, the Metro: [Chinese medicine and herbal ban to see Britain defy EU laws](http://www.metro.co.uk/news/855767-chinese-medicine-and-herbal-ban-to-see-britain-defy-eu-laws) The Daily Telegraph covered the story: [Herbal medicine to be regulated, says Andrew Lansley](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8328791/Herbal-medicine-to-be-regulated-says-Andrew-Lansley.html). The comments featured some pretty mad rants from herbalists, to which I tried to reply. The Metro article elicited a fine bit of abuse from a Lynda Kane. I'm constantly amazed at the downright viciousness of cuddly holistic therapists when they get found out. I guess it is just another bad case of cognitive dissonance. I can't resist a few quotations. Sir, \"I have just come across your asinine comments quoted in the London Metro newspaper re the EU herbal medicine directive. For a supposed scientist your mis-informed, closed-minded, unsubstantiated bigotry leaves me speechless\" \"As a scientist myself, I abide by the virtues of open-minded neutrality and accepting the hypothesis until proven otherwise by null-hypothesis based research.\" \"How many of the innumerable studies on the efficacy of herbal medicine have you read? \" \"Perhaps in your 'day' professors could say whatever they liked and be listened to. That day is long gone, as you must know from the various law-suits you have been party to.\" I love the idea that statistics allow you to accept any hypothesis whatsoever until someone shows it to be wrong. This would be funny if it were not so sad (and rather painful). As always I replied politely and referred her to [NCCAM's Guide to Herbs](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/herbsataglance.htm), so she can check up on that plethora of evidence that she seems to think exists. This is Lynda Kane of [energyawareness.org](http://energyawareness.org/). I can recommend her web site, if you want some truly jaw-dropping woo. She'll sell you a \"White Jade Energy Egg - may provide up to 5 times as much protection from wifi and from other peoples' energies - costs \u00a347.00\". Hmm, sounds good. How does it work? Easy. \"The human energy or \"qi\" field is shaped like an egg. It is being attacked by many forms of natural and man-made environmental stress 24 hours a day.\" I guess that's OK according to Ms Kane's interpretation of statistics which allows you to accept any hypothesis whatsoever until someone shows it to be wrong. Anyone for Trading Standards or the ASA? 17 February 2011. The excellent Andy Lewis has posted on similar problems \" [How to Spot Bad Regulation of Alternative Medicine](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/02/how-to-spot-bad-regulation-of-alternative-medicine.html)\" .20 July 2013 Nothing visible happened after this announcement. Until the government's resident medical loon, David Tredinnick MP forced [a debate on the matter](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#130709h0001.htm_spnew0). His introduction to the debate was his usual make-believe. Sadly it made much of [an exhibit at the Royal Society ](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=6105#030713)Summer Science exhibition -a bit of bait and swich by aromatherapists. After ploughing your way through pages of nonsense, you get to the interesting bit. At 10.38 am, The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health, Dr Daniel Poulter, announced what was happening. It seems that there may, after all, have been some effect of all the [sensible submissions](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2007) which pointed out the impossibility of regulating nonsense. The question of regulation has, yet again, been postponed. \"To ensure that we take forward the matter effectively, we want to bring together experts and interested parties from all sides of the debate to form a working group that will gather evidence and consider all the viable options in more detail,\" One wonders who will be on this working group? If they don't choose the right people, it could be [as bad as the Pittilo report](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=6105#030713). It wasn't reassuring to read \" we want to set up a working group and to work with my hon. Friend [Tredinnick], and herbalists and others, to ensure that the legislation "}
