Vaccinations are a crucial part of that effort, but misinformation and fear-mongering can make it difficult to know what's best for your child. One of the most persistent myths surrounding vaccines is the alleged link between the MMR vaccine and autism. The Origins of the MMR-Autism Myth The MMR vaccine is a combination vaccine that protects against measles, mumps, and rubella. In 1998, a study published in The Lancet suggested a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. The study was later found to be fraudulent, and the lead author, Andrew Wakefield, was stripped of his medical license. Numerous studies since then have found no evidence of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. The Importance of Vaccinations Vaccinations are one of the most effective ways to protect your child's health. They not only protect your child from serious illnesses but also help prevent the spread of disease in your community. When enough people are vaccinated, it creates herd immunity, which means that even those who cannot be vaccinated due to medical reasons are protected. Why Choose Nao Medical for Vaccinations?
