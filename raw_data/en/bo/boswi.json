The Office's existing mandate, for example, is fully in line with Target 3.5 ( 'Strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol' ) on a number of fronts, including: supporting a balanced public health -oriented approach to the drug problem by working to end discrimination against, an d promote interventions for, people who use drugs; and strengthening the access to comprehensive, evidence -based, and gender -responsive services for prevention of drug use and treatment of substance drug use disorders, including as an alternative to convi ction or punishment. UNODC is also mandated to provide HIV prevention, treatment and care among people who use drugs or are in prisons, contributing towards ending AIDS by 2030, a segment of the Target 3.3 ('By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosi s, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water -borne diseases and other communicable diseases' ). 1 Most publications are available in E nglish. W here other languages are available, this has been noted ( Arabic, Chinese , French, Russian and Spanish ). 2 This list is current as of 13.12.2018. Page 2 of 43 The International Drug Control Conventions mandate Member States to increase access to essential controlled drugs. UNODC partners in p articular with the World Health Organization (WHO) and civil society leaders to meet a section of Target 3.8 ( 'Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health -care services and access to safe, effe ctive, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all' ) and Target 3.b ('Support the research and development of vaccines and medicines for the communicable and non -communicable diseases that primarily affect developing countries, provide access to affordable essential medicines and vaccines, in accordance with the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health' ) which affirms the right of developing countries to use to the full the provisions in the Agreement on Trade -Related As pects of Intellectual Property Rights regarding flexibilities to protect public health, and, in particular, provide access to medicines for all. UNODC offers assistance to requesting Member States in drafting legislation to implement their obligations und er the international drug control conventions. UNODC also promotes standards and guidelines, builds the capacity of governmental and non -governmental professionals, and seeks to establish effective partnerships at country level and internationally includin g with WHO and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and its other co -sponsors and civil society organizations. UNODC's research work supports countries in the monitoring and reporting of SDG 3 by implementing drug monitoring systems f or collection of reliable data (while protecting human rights and confidentiality) of people suffering from drug use disorders and dependence, people injecting drugs (PWID) and living with HIV and those receiving evidence -based services for prevention and treatment of substance use disorders. As a part of its work under this thematic area, UNODC further supports countries' forensic sector capacity development. One area is the identification and/or detection of substances of abuse which is a primary step f or evidence -based interventions, including treatment. UNODC's initiatives to strengthen global forensic capacity, including through its early warning advisory on new psychoactive substances which monitors emerging substances of abuse, increases the prepare dness of countries to reduce the risks due to these substances and to institute measures to prevent their abuse and the associated health risks. UNODC's field activities under SDG 3 assist in the provision of quality services to governmental and non -governmental entities and different walks of life on prevention of communicable and non - communicable diseases; gender equity; and developing and implementing tailor -made programmes to reduce the increasing trend of drug use, HIV/AIDS, and Hepatitis C.

Database of legislation The UNODC Drug Control Repository is an electronic database of information on the implementation of the international drug control conventions. It contains national legislation on drug control searchable by country and/or topic (i.e. treatment, prevention, special/vulnerable groups with drug use disorders, etc). The Drug Control Repository is available at: https://sherloc.unodc.org/cld/v3/drugcontrolrepository/ UNODC tools and publications on Target 3.8 Achieve universal health coverage, including financi al risk protection, access to quality essential health -care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all: Ensuring Availability of Controlled Medications for The Relief Of Pain And Preventing Dive rsion And Abuse, September 2011 ; Joint Global Programme on Access to Controlled Drugs for Medical Purposes with WHO and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) . SDG 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all Obtaining a quality education is the foundation to improving people's lives and sustainable development. UNODC's Education for Justice (E4J) initiative is part of the Global Programme for the Implementation of the Doha Declaration , which was adopted following the 13th United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice in 2015. The initiative seeks to educate young peopl e on crime, justice and rule of law issues and promote a culture of lawfulness through education materials and activities designed for the primary, secondary and tertiary levels. The E4J initiative supports Sustainable Development Goal Target 4.7: \"By 203 0, ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others, through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non -violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity and of culture's contribution to sustainable development.\" In addition, activities under E4J also support the other Sustainable Development Goals related to UNODC's mandates, especially Goal 16. At the primary education level , E4J focuses on promoting and teaching values such as acceptance, fairness, integrity and respect. In addition to the teaching of v alues, E4J's educational materials contribute to building the basic skills needed to resiliently respond to crime and violence, as well as to identify and resolve moral or simple ethical dilemmas. Page 7 of 43 E4J's approach to secondary education is to develop tools and materials to promote the understanding of the basic concepts that lie at the core of UNODC's mandate areas: crime prevention, criminal justice and the rule of law. Secondary level students , through E4J tools and materials, will be empowered to identify, prevent and resolve moral, ethical and/or legal dilemmas. At the primary and secondary education levels, UNODC has partnered with UNESCO to develop tools that support the promotion of the rule of law and Global Citizenship Education. By strengthening the capacities of policymakers, educat ors, teacher trainers and curriculum developers, the partnership will empower learners to engage in society as constructive and ethically responsible agents of change, supporting justice and strong institutions. The tertiary education component of E4J seeks to support tertiary level educators and academics in their efforts to transmit knowledge and create a deeper understanding of rule of law related issues, with a focus on the subject areas o f anti -corruption, organized crime, trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants, counter -terrorism, cybercrime, criminal justice and crime prevention, firearms trafficking, as well as integrity and ethics.

SDG 5: Achieve Gender Equality and Empower All Women and Girls UNODC supports Member States to reach the Targets under SDG 5 by: promoting access to justice for women and girls; supporting the development of legislation and policies that protect their rights and prevent as well as respond to violence against women and girls; develop ing institutional and professional capacities relevant to respecting, protecting and fulfilling the rights of women and girls; and creating the conditions for women and girls to be in a position to claim their rights and be active agents of change. Further , UNODC monitors violence against women by collecting data from Member States and by assisting them to conduct surveys on the topic. These can provide important evidence to address violence against and intentional killing of women. UNODC also works to imp rove the protection of women and girls through its work in tackling trafficking in persons, of whom 70 percent are women and girls. UNODC helps States to draft laws and create comprehensive national anti -trafficking strategies and to develop local capacity and expertise to implement these, including by providing practical tools to encourage cross -border cooperatio n in investigations and prosecutions. UNODC also monitors the trafficking in women and girls by collecting data on the victims of this crime. Page 8 of 43 UNODC's global work on the prevention of drug use and the treatment of drug use disorders specifically addresses the unique needs of women and girls, within a framework of human rights through the publication of guidance documents, training of professionals and the implementation of gender -based services meeting the needs of children, adolescent girls and women. UNO DC HIV programme advocate for gender -responsive HIV services for women who inject drugs and women in prisons and addresses the special needs of women who inject drugs through publication and dissemination of technical briefs and guidance and through implem entation projects in the field specific to women who inject drugs in the community and in prisons. Additionally, the international community is increasingly recognizing the importance of integrating a gender perspective into the global counter -terrorism e fforts. While women and girls continue to be victims of crimes committed by terrorist groups, reports have also shown the growing involvement of women in terrorism, including in FTF related offences . With a view to supporting States in countering such un ique legal and human rights challenges, UNODC and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) launched in 2016 a new technical assistance initiative on gender dimensions in criminal justice responses to terrorism . It seeks to support Member States, initially in West and Central Africa, to integrate gender dimensions in their criminal justice responses to terrorism. Among other aspects (e.g. sexual and gender -based violence by terrorist groups, women as perpetrators of terrorist acts, detention of women accused or convicted of terrorism offences, and alternatives to detention), the new project addresses gender aspects of the criminalization of FTF and issues specifi c to the detention, rehabilitation and reintegration of returning female FTF. It also provides guidance on accountability for sexual and gender -based violence crimes committed by FTF. Taking into account an urgent need to better understand and integrate g ender perspectives across measures to prevent terrorism, UNODC will soon make available a first specialized training manual on gender dimensions of criminal justice responses to terrorism. The tool will be used in future UNODC training activities and by UN ODC -trained national trainers. The empowerment of women is also at the core of the Office's alternative development programmes. Moreover, under SDG 5, \"Gender Equality\"; target 5.6, UNODC includes activities in its field-level programmes that support Drop -in-Centers and their drug users/referrals through providing coverage of sexual protection means. UNODC i nterventions under SDG 5 will assist in preventing the spread of HIV and other communicable diseases among the population of drug users, mostly intravenous.

Tools and publications Illustrated guide for the disposal of chemical used in the illicit manufacture of drugs . SDG 8: Promote Sustained, Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Growth, Full and Productive Employment and Decent Work for All UNODC will continue to implement Alternative Development programmes in those countries most severely affected by illicit drug cultivation and support poor farmer communities involved in illicit cultivation to engage in licit income alternatives. Through on -the-ground work, UNODC addresses the challenges of food insecurity, sustainable agriculture, and economic growth in these communities. In particular, UNODC helps farmers to form associations in order to secure market access for their products and promote sustai nable income generation over the long -term, ultimately contributing to SDG 8. UNODC's work in combatting trafficking in persons and the smuggling of migrants, described in detail below, is directly relevant to Target 8.7 ('Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour in all its forms' ) and Target 8.8 ('Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers, in particular women migrants, and those in precarious employment' ). In this regard, UNODC supports Member States to provide ef fective responses in a new area of work for UNODC: children recruited and exploited by terrorist and violent extremist groups and the role of the justice systems, in particular , the juvenile justice system in order to ensure children are better protected from all serious forms of serious violence and treated in accordance with international law. UNODC's research on trafficking in persons published in the biennial Global Report contains information specifically on forced labour and trafficking in children, including their use as child soldiers. Read more on this work as described under SDG 10. Tools and publications Page 12 of 43 Needs assessments and Baseline Studies for Alternative Development Projects in Afghanistan.

SDG 10: Reduce Inequality Within and Among Countries The facilitation of orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration (Target 10.7 'Facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, including through the implementat ion of planned and well -managed migration policies' ) is essential for decreasing profit opportunities for migrant smugglers and human traffickers. These goals recognize that successful strategies to manage migration must be framed within the more inclusive and comprehensive context of development. UNODC assists Member States in expanding their capacity to prevent and combat the smuggling of migrants and trafficking in persons, to protect trafficking victims and smuggled migrants and ensure that their right s are respected and to promote cooperation between Member States. The Protocols of the Smuggling of Migrants and the Trafficking in Persons under the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime are international legal instruments requiring mandatory national actions and providing practical to ols that can facilitate cooperation and provide a range of shared actions to combat these crimes. UNODC also collects and publishes information, at the global level, on human traffickers and how they use the opportunity to exploit vulnerable people in orde r to maximize their profits. Similar data collection is to be carried out on migrant smugglers. UNODC's work to reduce illicit financial flows contributes to reaching SDG 10 and Target 10.b ('Encourage official development assistance and financial flows, including foreign direct investment, to States where the need is greatest, in particular , least developed countries, African countries, small island developing States and landlocked developing countries, in accordance with their national plans and programm es'). Smuggling of Migrants UNODC's existing portfolio of technical assistance activities concerning the implementation of the Smuggling of Migrants Protocol implicitly contributes to achieving target 10.7. A current catalogue of UNODC's existing related technical tools and resources is attached. Recent examples Page 13 of 43 of UNODC's related normative, policy and technical assistance that contribute to progress towards this target include legislative assistance programmes in Central Amer ica to develop specialised anti-migrant smuggling laws in line with the Smuggling of Migrants Protocol; regional capacity building workshops such as that conducted in Syracuse, Italy, in 2015 to prevent and combat the smuggling of migrants in the Mediterra nean Sea; and the development and publication of the 2015 report, 'Migrant Smuggling in Asia: Current Trends and Related Challenges'.

SDG 10 is also closely related to the work of UNODC on HIV and people who use drugs and HIV and people in prisons. Targets 3 and 4 under this SDG envisage the reduction o f inequalities, the elimination of discriminatory laws and policies and the promotion of social protection policies, constituting a call for action for equal treatment for all people, including people who use drugs and people in prisons. SDG 11: Make Cities Inclusive, Safe, Resilient and Sustainable By 2030, it is estimated that almost sixty percent of the world's population will be urbanized. In many urban areas, high rates of crime and violence are undermining growth and impeding social development, particularly affecting the poor. UNODC is mandated to support Member States in the application and implementation of the crime conventions as well as the standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice, including, among others, the Guideline s for the Prevention of Crime, the Guidelines for Cooperation and Technical Assistance in the Field of Urban Crime Prevention, and the Guidelines for the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency , and the United Nations Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Children in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (UN Model Strategies on VAC), strategy II: implementing comprehensive prevention programmes . At the operational level, UNODC is supporting Member States by p roviding advisory services for the development and implementation of crime prevention national strategies and action plans, as well as with sector -specific projects, including preventing child involvement in crime and violence as well as youth crime and vi ctimization, violence against women and children, while promoting access to justice or social reintegration of offenders. UNODC, in partnership with other United Nations organizations, civil society, academia and the private sector, also supports local -level initiatives by engaging in the conduct of local safety audits and the implementation of crime prevention projects at city and community levels. The role of local government is vital as this is the layer of government closest to the people, and it often has significant decision -making and spending power. Accordingly, recognizing that the future success of the SDGs resides in large part in cities, UNODC is determined to contribute to the \"localizing\" of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development for ur ban policy -makers and planners, particularly those residing in the Global South. This work will provide a contribution to the United Nations system -wide effort in urban crime prevention and security.

All these impact -based actions contribute to the prevention of forest degradation. Further, the Alternative Development programmes contribute to the preservation and sustainable use of natural resources through land stabilization projects and by helping to build resilience in communities affected by climate change. UNODC's Illicit Crop Monitoring Programme (ICMP) monitors crops and land cover changes (deforestati on, illegal mining) and the impact of Alternative Development Programmes. Annual reports that are based on extensive satellite image analysis provide transparent and reliable figures on the cultivation of illicit crops, on the impact of eradication campaig ns and on land cover changes with specific focus on forests and protected (nature conservation) areas. Wildlife and forest crime has become a low -risk, high-profit transnational organized crime, which is overwhelming countries and communities, affecting biodiversity and development. Through its Global Programme for Combating Wildlife and Forest Crime, UNODC will pursue its support at the frontline with law enforcement, prosecution, judiciary and relevant stakeholders at the national and international leve l to address this issue. UNODC is leading work on strengthening national legislative frameworks, law enforcement, prosecutorial and judicial capacity, fostering international cooperation, developing innovative solutions in forensics and conducting research through its global wildlife crime research. Through this global research work, UNODC supports the monitoring of SDG 15, in particular , Target 15.7 ( 'Take urgent action to end poaching and trafficking of protected species of flora and fauna and address bot h demand and supply of illegal wildlife products '). In the years to come, UNODC aims at providing support to countries to reach SDG 14 and SDG 15 in reducing organized wildlife and forest crime through concrete measurable evidence -based interventions. UNODC is part of the International Consortium on Combatting Wildlife Crime (ICCWC), consisting of five global entities working together to deliver multi -agency support to countries affected by the illegal trade in animals and plants. UNODC engages in act ion against fisheries crime through its Global Maritime Crime Programme. Initial steps have been taken with the creation of a sub -group on illegal fishing to the UNODC established Indian Ocean Forum on Maritime Crime (IOFMC). The group facilitates coordina tion and cooperation among coastal state actors in tackling fisheries crime. The GMCP's focus is supporting Member States in securing legal frameworks, building capacity in law enforcement, prosecution , and judiciary, as well as strengthening cooperation a mong states.

UNODC's work , therefore, supports all the Targets inc luded under SDG 16, and in particular the following: Target 16.1: Significantly reduce all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere UNODC keeps a database on Homicide Statistics and has published two Global Studies on Homicide to date, the first in 2011 and again in 2013. UNODC's work on the prevention and response to violence against women (referred to under SDG 5) and violence against children (Target 16.2) as well as the work on drug prevention and treatment (SDG 3) also contribute toward s Target 16.1. According to WHO, family skills training is one of the evidence -based interventions to reduce violence (see WHO (2010), Violence prevention: the evidence available in English, French and Spanish at http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/4th _milestones_meeting/publications/e n/), particularly youth violence (see WHO (2015), Preventing youth violence: an overview of the evidence, available English and Spanish at http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/youth/youth_violence/en/). T he relevant tools in this respect would be: the International Standards on Drug Use Prevention, English and Page 25 of 43 Russian; the Compilation Of Evidence -Based Family Skills Training Programmes, 2010, English; the Guide To Implementing Family Skills Training Progr ammes For Drug Abuse Prevention, February 2009, Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish (all tools available at http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/drug -prevention -and-treatment/publications.html ). UNODC tools and publications: Measuring violence against women and other gender issues through the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS) lenses (2017); ICCS Briefing Note: Unlawful killings in conflict situations(2017); Global Homicide Study (2011, 2014) . Target 16.2: End abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children Target 16.2 builds on the international momentum to promote children's rights and urgently tackle the issue of violence against children. It represented an important achievement in order to provide visibility and strengthen political commitment around the issue of violence against children. UNODC collects and analy ses the United Nations Surveys on Crime Trends and the Operations of Criminal Justice Systems (UN -CTS) in line with the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS) that could contribute to measure target 16.2 as well as understand global trends related to children in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice. Through its questionnaire and data collection for the biennial Global Report on Trafficking in Persons, UNODC supports the monitoring of the exploitation and traffic king in persons, including children through reported cases of trafficking crimes worldwide. In addition, UNODC is piloting an innovative method to help States measure the hidden numbers of trafficking victims in order to more effectively assess trends and policy interventions. These tools are relevant to Targets 5.2, 8.7 and 16.2. Also, according to WHO, family skills training is one of the evidence -based interventions to reduce violence (see WHO (2010), Violence prevention: the evidence available in Engl ish, French and Spanish at http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/4th_milestones_meeting/publications/e n/), particularly child maltreatment (see WHO (2016) INSPIRE: Seven strategies for Ending Violence Against Children, available in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish at http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/inspire/en/ ). The relevant tools in this respect would be: the International Standards on Drug Use Prevention, English and Russian; the Compilation Of Evidence -Based Family Skills Training Programmes, 2010, English; the Guide To Implementing Family Skills Training Programmes For Drug Abuse Prevention, February 20 09, Arabic, Chinese, Eng lish, French, Russian, Spanish (all tools available at http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/drug -prevention -and-treatment/publications.html). UNODC tools and publications: Global Report on Trafficking in Persons (2009, 2012, 2014, 2016) ; Questionnaire for the Global Report on Trafficking in Persons 2016 ; Page 26 of 43 Research Brief: Multiple Systems Estimation for estimating the number of victims of human trafficking across the world ; Study on the Effects of New Information Technologies on the Abuse and Exploitation of Children. Trafficking in Persons UNODC's existing portfolio of technical assistance activities concerning the implementation of the Trafficking in Persons Protocol directly contributes to achieving multiple SDGs, including SDG 16. There are three SDGs which make explicit reference to trafficking in persons - SDGs 5, 8, and 16 or more specifically targets 5.2, 8.7 and 16.2 (existing UNODC responses to human trafficking are also relevant to targets 16.3, 16.4, and 16a). Of key relevance to UNODC's related technical assistance activities is the agreed global indicator for review of SDG 16.2, being \" the number of detected and estimated number of non -detected adult women and men and girls and boys (18 -) who have been trafficked for different forms of trafficking in persons\". As the only agreed SDG indicator referring to trafficking in persons, it can be applied similarly to all of the SDGs noted above. While the underlying research capacities are still being developed to support thi s indicator, all of UNODC's related technical assistance efforts can be easily reformulated in the terminology of the SDGs on trafficking in persons - that is, to simultaneously impact on the ratio between detected and non -detected trafficking (i.e. increas e detection of actual trafficking), while decreasing the overall occurrence of trafficking in persons. Direct examples of related UNODC work would include capacity -building efforts to enhance the identification of trafficking victims, the dissemination of practitioner material regarding core evidential challenges faced by prosecutors and legislative assistance to better ensure the support and protection of victims.

Target 16.3: Promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure equal access to justice for all UNODC directly makes contribution to promotion of the rule of law through providing secretariat services to the intergovernmental bodies, i.e., the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, the Co nference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption. Also, a s mentioned earlier, UNODC supports Member States to put an end to all forms of violence against children and ensuring rights -based justice for children , which plays a crucial role in strengthening the rule of law (target 16.3) and goes hand in hand with development and peace. Access to justice for all is a focus area in UNODC's work on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice. UNODC supports the establishment of effective, fair and humane criminal justice systems. Recognizing that poor prison conditions and prison overcrowding point towards systemic deficiencies in States' justice systems, UNODC promotes penal and prison reform, as well as access to justice. These areas include a lack of: access to legal aid; alternatives to imprisonment; youth crime prevention programmes; offenders' rehabilitation; social reintegrat ion measures; as well as the overuse of pre -trial detention. UNODC is also well placed to monitor Target 16.3 through its annual United Nations Survey on Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems (UN -CTS) and its annual report on 'World cri me trends and emerging issues and responses in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice' to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice. UNODC tools and publications: Handbook on strategies to reduce overcrowding in prisons Handbook on Early access to legal aid in criminal justice processes; Model Law on Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems with Commentaries; A Practitioner's Toolkit on Women's Access to Justice Programming Page 28 of 43 Handbook of basic principles and promising p ractices on alternatives to imprisonment Handbook on restorative justice programmes. Target 16.4: By 2030, significantly reduce illicit financial and arms flows, strengthen the recovery and return of stolen assets and combat all forms of organized crime UNODC offers Member States a full spectrum of tools to strengthen anti -money laundering legal frameworks and develop capacities of national agencies to investigate money laundering and terrorism financing, disrupt illicit financial flows and support the recovery of stolen assets. In this regard, the Global Programme against Money Laundering, Proceeds of Crime and the Financing of Terrorism (hereafter GPML) of UNODC has developed anti -money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) model legislation for both civil and common law legal systems. The civil model law was developed in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund and the common model law in collaboration with the Commonwealth Secretariat and the International Monetary Fund. Asset recovery is the most innovative chapt er of the United Nations Convention against Corruption on which UNODC's work in the domain rests. In the framework of the second cycle of the UNCAC review mechanism the States' efforts to adopt asset recovery measures will be reviewed over the next five ye ars. Through various global programmes on money laundering, counter -terrorism and organized crime, UNODC and its partners at international and regional levels have been supporting the establishment and activities of various regional cooperation structure s in prosecution, law enforcement, financial intelligence , and asset recovery. In particular, since 2007 UNODC and the World Bank have cooperated through the Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative, a joint programme working with developing countries and financia l centres to prevent the laundering of the proceeds of corruption and to facilitate more systematic and timely the return of stolen assets. GPML of UNODC assisted Member States in establishing and setting up Asset Recovery Interagency Networks (ARIN), with the first being the Asset Recovery Interagency Network of Southern Africa (ARINSA) in 2008, and subsequently the Red de Recuperaci\u00f3n de Activos de GAFILAT (RRAG) in 2010, the Asset Recovery Interagency Network of Asia Pacific (ARIN -AP) in 2013, the Asset Recovery Interagency Network of West Africa (ARINWA) in 2014 , the Asset Recovery Interagency Network of the Caribbean (ARIN -CARIB) in 2017, and the Asset Recovery Interagency Network of West Central Asia (ARIN -WCA) in 2018 . These informal networks exist fo r exchange of information on individuals, companies, and assets at the international level with the intention of facilitating the pursuit and recovery of proceeds of unlawful activities. All predicate crimes for money laundering are covered, including corr uption, financing of terrorism and tax crimes, to name a few. SDG 16.4 related to illicit arms flows provides for a broad spectrum of measures that States need to put in place in order to be able to fully implement and achieve this target. The proposed in dicator 16.4.2 focuses in particular on the proportion of seized , found and surrendered arms whose illicit origin has been traced or otherwise established in line with international standards and instruments. The Firearms Protocol is one of the major global instruments related to this target. Through its annual Illicit Arms Flows Questionnaire (IAFQ), UNODC implements the data collection process for the illicit traff icking in firearms, which pursues the dual goal of collecting data for SDG indicator 16.4.2 and to gather comprehensive seizure data for the next Global Study on Firearms Trafficking. The IAFQ provides the opportunity for UN Member States to share Page 29 of 43 qualitat ive and quantitative data on seized, found and surrendered firearms, their parts and components and ammunition on a regular basis. The questionnaire has been circulated to Member States in June 2018, and UNODC is continuing to reach out to Permanent Missio ns as well as focal points and other points of contacts - including through its field offices - to solicit replies from Member States. Through its Global Firearms Programme (GFP), UNODC assists Member States in adhering to and implementing the Firearms Pr otocol, to prevent and combat the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, and address their links to organized crime and terrorism, and in doing so, enabling them also to implement and achieve the SDG 16.4. GFP's assistance includes the follo wing areas: (a) Legislative and policy development ; (b) Technical support in the areas of marking, record -keeping, tracing, transfer controls and the collection, management and disposal of firearms; ( c) Training and capacity -building to strengthen the crim inal justice response to investigate and prosecute firearms -related criminality and related crimes (including firearms tracing); (d) International cooperation and information exchange by establishing national institutions, international police and judicia l cooperation in criminal matters as well as information exchange; (e) Data collection, research and analysis to monitor illicit trafficking flows. All these areas are closely linked to the implementation, reporting and monitoring of target 16.4: Enhanci ng national recording, marking and tracing abilities, and reinforcing investigative capacities of States are pre -conditions to implement the target. Enhanced national data collection is also a pre -requisite for States to report and support its monitoring. In 2015 , GFP developed the Firearms Study, which used firearms seizure data from Member States, and was mandated to continue to collect such data on a regular basis, with a view to possibly conduct periodic studies. This creates a solid foundation to suppo rt ongoing monitoring of target 16.4. Further, UNODC carries out research and data collection in several areas connected to organized crime including firearms, drugs and other illicit markets, wildlife crime and trafficking in persons and the links with terrorism . UNODC has also assessed the impact of organized crime particularly in its Transnational Organized Crime Threat Assessments. The online knowledge management portal for Sharing Electronic Resources and Laws on Crime (SHERLOC) disseminates information on how States implement the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) and it currently lists fifteen different crime types, including cybercrime and money laundering.

UNODC, including through its Stolen Asset Recovery Programme has developed a host of tools, databases and te chnical publications. They can be accessed at: http://star.worldbank.org/star/ Asset recovery is a highly technical and politically sensitive topic and thus it would be advisable for FOs to involve CEB/ StAR from the earliest possible stage in any consultations with counterparts and programming activities, of particular use are the f ollowing tools: The Asset Recovery Watch Database: This database provides a collection of past and ongoing large -scale international asset recovery cases. It can be searched by jurisdictions involved and as such provides a good background for any discuss ions with counterparts. The Asset Recovery Practitioners Handbook: This publication provides technical guidance to asset recovery practitioners and as such gives a good overview also of the type of technical assistance that can be provided through StAR. Few and Far and Tracking Anti -Corruption and Asset Recovery commitments: These two publications provide macro data on assets actually seized, confiscated and returned in the context of international asset recovery cases since 2006. As such, it provides u seful information that can be used in the preparation of gene ral presentations on the topic. Moreover, the 2nd review cycle of the UNCAC will commence in June 2016 with approximately 35-40 countries being reviewed every year for the next five years for th eir compliance with the chapters on prevention and asset recovery. The schedule for these reviews will become available as part of the report of the 7th session of the Implementation Review Group to the Convention.

Target 16.5: Substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms The United Nations Convention against Corruption contains the most comprehensive set of legal commitments by Governments to t ackle corruption, including bribery. Under the auspices of UNODC, the Conference of the States Parties to the Convention met in November 2015 in St. Petersburg and identified a number of avenues for UNODC to further strengthen capacity and cooperation agai nst corruption and bribery in all its forms - an explicit Target of the SDGs . The effective implementation of the Convention is being assessed under the framework of the Implementation Review Mechanism through a peer review exercise with each of the 178 St ates parties being reviewed for their compliance by two other States parties with the support of the Secretariat provided by UNODC. Based on the requirements of the Convention and the findings of the country reviews, UNODC assists Member States in preventi ng, detecting, investigating and sanctioning corruption and in promoting international cooperation against corruption, as well as the recovery of proceeds of corruption, both domestically and internationally. UNODC is at the forefront of developing standard surveys measuring the experience of corruption and setting standards for measuring various aspects of corruption. As such the results of the country reviews carried out within the framework of the Implementation Review Mechanism provide an objecti ve basis to assess the efforts made by countries in preventing and combatting corruption. UNODC has developed a host of databases, tools and other resources which can be used by FOs in their interactions with counterparts in terms of advancing the impleme ntation of goal 16 through the effective implementation of UNCAC.

Target 16.6: Develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels UNODC supports efforts by States to develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions through the comprehensive implementation of chapter II of the United Nations Convention against Corrupt ion. This work includes policies, legislation and mechanisms to strengthen the prevention of corruption at all levels, Through its role as Secretariat to the Working Group on the Prevention of Corruption - a body established by the Conference of the States Parties to the Convention - UNODC facilitates the sharing of information on lessons learned and the adaptability of good practices on the prevention of corruption in public and private sector institutions, including accountability measur es, strengthening professionalism and integrity, and promoting public access to information and the transparency of institutional functions and services. In advance of the forthcoming review of the effective implementation of chapter II under the framework of the Implement ation Review Mechanism, UNODC has promoted and supported early reporting by States of progress in the implementation of chapter II. In addition, UNODC has Page 37 of 43 produced guidance materials and provided technical assistance to support States in such areas as the development and implementation of comprehensive anti -corruption strategies, strengthening judicial and prosecutorial integrity and accountability, developing asset and interest disclosure procedures to avoid conflicts of interest, promoting transparency in public procurement, and measures to protect witnesses and whistle -blowers. In addition, UNODC promotes transparency and the prevention of corruption in the private sector, in partnership with the United Nations Global Compact. This work includes the deve lopment of tools and training materials to further integrity and transparent business practices across the private sector as well as engagement with other bodies, such as the G20 and its Business -20 Anti - Corruption Working Group as well as the World Econom ic Forum. Target 16.7: Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision -making at all levels In designing and delivering its programmes, as well as in the international policy debate around its mandates, UNODC encourages and facilit ates the participation of a wide range of civil society organizations, contributing to an open, responsive and accountable decision -making process on crime - and drug -related matters at the international level. Examples of this work include multi - stakeholde r workshops on the United Nations Convention against Corruption to allow civil society to be equipped and participate in the Implementation Review Mechanism of the Convention. Another example UNODC HAS established a group of 17 regional and global harm re duction and community representative organizations to inform and joint planning of work. UNODC is scaling up its regular data collection and analysis system to make it fit the needs of monitoring SDG 16. Furthermore, UNODC is consolidating its long -time global series related to homicide, trafficking in persons and criminal justice efficiency, among others, as well as refining the indicators to address new needs, while at the same assisting countries to strengthen their capacity to monitor SDG 16. Target 16.a.: Strengthen relevant national institutions, including through international cooperation, for building capacity at all levels, in particular in developing countries, to prevent violence and combat terrorism and crime. UNODC works to support Member States, including developing countries, and their criminal justice and law enforcement institutions to prevent and counter terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, thus contributing to reaching SGD16 and in particular SGD 16.a. Within the framework o f its Global Programme on Strengthening the Legal Regime against Terrorism, UNODC promotes the ratification and implementation of the 19 international conventions and protocols related to terrorism and relevant United Nations resolutions, provides legislat ive assistance with incorporation of their provisions into national legislation, strengthens national counter -terrorism capacity and cooperation among Member States, especially to facilitate mutual legal assistance and extradition requests. Capacity building plays an important role in addressing the increasingly complex nature of terrorism, including countering its new and emerging threats. In its specialized technical assistance programmes, UNODC focuses on the legal and operational aspects of crimi nalization of a broad range of terrorist offenses, including foreign terrorist fighters and their radicalization, the growing nexus between terrorism and transnational organized crime, terrorism financing, including through trafficking in cultural property , and appeal and glorification of terrorism, including through the Page 38 of 43 Internet. Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism is crucial for preventing violence and the spread of radicalization and promoting intercultural dialog ue and understanding. Therefore , aspects related to human rights, including children's rights, are fully integrated into UNODC work on preventing and countering terrorism. Criminalizing terrorist - related offenses is instrumental not only in bringing perpetrators of terrorist attacks to j ustice but also in countering terrorist narratives and should be an important part of an effective strategy to address the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism. As outlined above, under the UNODC's work on Violence against Children in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, UNODC is contributing to achieving target 16 as UNODC has been supporting Member States in their efforts to provide effective responses to the complex challenges associated with children recruited and exploited b y terrorist and violent extremist groups and ensure that children are treated in a manner that observes their rights and respects their dignity in accordance with applicable international law. UNODC tools and publications To support its counter -terrorism capacity building and training, UNODC has produced 38 tools and publications . UNODC made available several modules of its counter -terrorism legal training curriculum , i.e. on the universal legal regime, international cooperation in criminal matters relate d to terrorism, respect for human rights while countering terrorism, transport -related terrorism offences and international legal framework against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear terrorism. The UNODC Counter -Terrorism Online Training Platform is another important tool specifically designed for the distant professional legal training in terrorism prevention, which also offers practitioners with an opportunity for networking and sharing of good practices thus promoting cooperation in cri minal matters related to terrorism among Member States UNODC's strong expertise in the area of mutual legal assistance and extradition is supported by the production of several compendia of bilateral, regional and international agreements in criminal mat ters related to terrorism, such as the recently published Compendium of Bilateral and Regional Instruments for South Asia: International Cooperation in Criminal Matters . Beyond the formal agreements between Member States, judicial cooperation networks can be also very effective to facilitate requests for mutual legal assistance and extradition. The regional judicial platform for the Sahel countries is an example of such an efficiently functioning mechanism, and another similar platform is planned for Cent ral African countries. UNODC has also produced a broad range of practical guides, handbooks and manuals aimed at assisting Member States in their efforts to prevent and counter -terrorism , such as The Use of the Internet for Terrorist Purposes, Good Practi ces in Supporting Victims of Terrorism within the Criminal Justice Framework and The Digest of Terrorist Cases. UNODC also maintains electronic databases as a source for the judiciary and law enforcement, such as the Electronic Legal Resources on International Terrorism and the Observatory of Jurisprudence for the America (in Spanish only). Page 39 of 43 Further to Security Council resolution 2322 (2016), UNODC has expanded its CNA Directory to include the contact details of designated authorities responsible for counter -terrorism matters. The CNA Directory is available at: https://sherloc.unodc.org/cld/en/v3/sherloc/cnadir.html Among various delivery methods used by UNODC, mock trials and investigations of terrorism financing cases and study tours to national entities dealing with terrorism have also demonstrated their relevance and efficiency for criminal justice officials to acquire specialized skills and exchange good practices to investigate and prosecute terrorism -related cases. UNODC also enters into s trategic partnerships with national training institutions to promote professional legal training on counter -terrorism issues through train -the-trainer programmes and the development of training materials customized for each national legal system. ********* *** For each of these Targets, the international community has agreed on specific indicators that are based either on data collected from administrative sources or on data derived from sample surveys and UNODC offers its experience in monitoring the relevant i ndicators to assess progress towards the SDGs . In addition, UNODC's global collection of administrative and survey data on crime and criminal justice and the promotion of crime victimization surveys, provide the statistical evidence base for monitoring patterns and trends of crime and the criminal justice response to crime, and for evaluating policy interventions and crime prevention measures. Under SDG 16, UNODC is the international lead organizations for compiling statistical indicators for a number of SDG Targets and plays an important part in measuring other Targets as well.

SDG 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development Improved policy coherence and increased multi -stakeholder partnerships are essential to the most critical element of the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: the ability of Member States to effectively raise, retain and manage their own domestic resources. Declines in official development assistance and an observed increase in the illicit flow of resources out of low - and medium -income countries has led to the prevention and mitigation of illicit financial flows and improvement of asset recovery efforts to be raised to the top of the development agenda. To this end, UNODC (CPS) reg ularly participates in Financing for Development (FfD) meetings , structures and events , including the Inter -Agency Task Force on Financing for Development. FfD aims to align all financing flows and policies with economic, social and environmental prioritie s within the framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. UNODC will continue to apply the knowledge, skills and experience of its staff and governing bodies to help Member States to reach these goals. UNODC is well placed to convene multi - stakeholder partnerships at the international level (and to assist Member States in convening them at the national level) to improve policy coherence and consequently the effectiveness of international, regional and national efforts to combat illicit financial flows. Finally, it is to be noted that the governing bodies of UNO DC, namely the Commissions on Narcotic Drugs (CND) and Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ) have a concrete opportunity to contribute to the review of progress made towards the SDGs . As per A/RES/66/288 of 27 July 2012 and A/RES/67/290 of 21 July 2013, and in the SDG declaration itself, the General Assembly established a High Level Political Forum (HLPF) on Sustainable Development as the primary forum to review progress on the sustainable development goals ensuring a political ownership by Member States. The forum is expected to meet every year under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and every four years under the auspices of the General Assembly and is aimed to provide the necessary political impetus needed for the implementa tion of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. While the modus operandi of the Forum has not yet been finalized, preliminary documents feature the input of ECOSOC functional commissions, among other contributions. To this end, UNODC will present a Conference Room Paper to the Commissions, outlining opportunities for contributing to the review by the HLPF. In particular, a number of Targets under SDG's 3 and 16 fall under the direct purview of the CND and the CCPCJ and it is conceivable that UNODC co uld utilize data that is already being collected, to monitor progress towards these goals. Partnerships among United Nations agencies, regional organizations, international non - governmental organizations and other relevant stakeholders are indispensable to promote political engagement, integrated approach, coordinate strategies and action in order to increase coherent Page 43 of 43 efforts to eliminate violence against children. UNODC efforts to work in partnership and with stakeholders in this area of work are at the fo refront of the agenda to boost legal and policy discussions to integrate children's rights, combine efforts and maximize "}
