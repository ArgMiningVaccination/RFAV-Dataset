The I-forces that ultimately help bring balance and healing live in the warmth of the will, and through this warmth we can find bridges to one another. When we come together we may hear our own voice speak forth in someone else, and we may experience a re-igniting of our impulses and courage for life. These Renewal Courses were created for that purpose. We believe that teachers who are connected in this way to their ideals and passion for life make the most creative and happy teachers! We strive for excellence in our grade specific course offerings: Christof Wiechert will continue to offer all participants four short morning lectures on Anthroposophy. David Gable will offer daily grade specific singing and recorder playing, and Roberto Trostli will supplement the upper elementary grades with the sciences. We have lengthened the days in week 1 to allow for these additional classes. New this summer is Christof Wiechert's two-summer Certificate course for Child Study Facilitators that will support the practice of Child (and Student) Study in our schools. New to this line- up of grade specific courses are Alison Henry and Signe Motter, who join our stellar grade school teaching faculty. We are delighted to let you know that in the first Renewal week, Michaela Gloeckler, MD, will be joining us to lead a course for doctors, therapists, teachers, and parents on The Spiritual Laws of Reincarnation and Destiny and Their Relevance for Health and Illness in Human Biography. In the second week we will be welcoming some new faculty including Jaap van der Wal, MD, Dorit Winter, Lisa Edge, Helena Hurrell, Sylvie Richard, and Donald Hall. In addition, we welcome back Virginia Sease and Dennis Klocek along with our core faculty members who help us carry the work of the Center for Anthroposophy: Cezary Ciaglo, Jamie York, Hugh Renwick, and Signe Motter. Please look inside this brochure and find a course that speaks to you, that may enliven and enrich you, and that will bring you back to us this coming summer! With warmest wishes, Karine Munk Finser Coordinator of Renewal Courses \"The will for freedom becomes the concern of the seeker of the spirit. This will for freedom is possessed by everyone who finds the support and basis for all he does in himself.\" -Rudolf Steiner Center for Anthroposophy \u2014 Renewal Courses 2016 1WEEK 1 The Spiritual Laws of Reincarnation and Destiny and Their Relevance for Health and Illness in Human Biography With Michaela Gloeckler, MD Tone Eurythmy with Leonore Russell The fields of medicine and pedagogy share profound concern and deep interest when it comes to promoting the healthy development and life-long thriving of our children and adolescents. Both doctors and educators are dedicated to removing hindrances and fostering health in our students' lives. Yet, we are powerless when life challenges such as illness, disaster, violence, accidents, or human error confront us or the people in our care. Again and again, we are asked to awaken to questions of destiny and karma and the spiritual laws that make themselves visible in our human gestures and deeds here on earth. Our biography reveals spiritual laws of reincarnation, and karma and healing require knowledge of these laws. In this course we will seek to understand expressions of individual destiny and karma, and explore conscious therapeutic approaches to support healing. Ultimately, we will discover the importance of the inner attitude of soul needed to address these life challenges in the healing process. Michaela Gloeckler, MD , studied German language/literature and history in Freiburg and Heidelberg and, from 1972 till 1978, medicine in T\u00fcbingen and Marburg, followed by further training as a pediatrician at the Community Hospital in Herdecke and the Bochum University Clinic. For ten years she served as pediatrician at the Community Hospital in Herdecke and worked as medical adviser at the Rudolf Steiner School of Witten in Central Germany. In 1988 she was appointed Head of the Medical Section at the School for Spiritual Science in Dornach, Switzerland. For the past 25 years she has been active as author, lecturer, and trainer of medical doctors around the globe. Leonore Russell , having completed the \"Eurythmy in the Workplace\" training with Anne-Marie Erhlich, uses this approach in her work with adult education, organizational development, businesses, and non-profits. Leonore runs her own consulting service, Understanding and Managing Change, and collaborates with Torin Finser as well as the company AdminService. Leonore earned her Eurythmy Diploma from the Goetheanum in Switzerland and has received degrees in both the Visual and Performing Arts from Sarah Lawrence College and Adelphi University. Center for Anthroposophy \u2014 Renewal Courses 2016 2 WEEK 1 The Child Study: A Two-Summer Course for Facilitators With Christof Wiechert We are happy to announce this two-summer course to support the heart of the faculty meeting: The Child (and Student) Study. It is our intention to strengthen our schools by deepening an understanding of child development and the mysteries of the young unfolding human being. The focus of this study will be directed towards developing capable child study facilitators who in turn can support their faculty meetings with fresh insights and guidance. We will practice imaginative knowledge, widen our understanding of applied anthroposophy, and practice our skills through case studies. Advanced studies in pedagogy and carefully guided case studies will be supplemented with mainstream psychology and an anthroposophically inspired anthropology to help promote the child study as an integral part of the faculty meeting and the thriving of our Waldorf schools. Participants are encouraged to come for two Renewal Courses (the first in 2016, the second in 2017) and upon completion will receive a Course Certificate from the Center for Anthroposophy signed by Mr. Wiechert. Upon completion, participants will become able to act as Child Study facilitators in their faculty meetings. Eurythmy with Cezary Ciaglo | Music with David Gable Christof Wiechert , a popular lecturer and seminar leader the world over, spent 30 years teaching at the Waldorf School in The Hague, where he was himself a pupil. During this time he was the co-founder of the Dutch Waldorf Teacher Training Seminar. For many years, Christof was a council member in the Anthroposophical Society in the Netherlands. Together with Ate Koopmans, he developed the \"Art of Child Study\" course. In 1999 he began to work for the Pedagogical Section of the Society, and from 2001 until 2011 served as Leader of the Pedagogical Section of the School for Spiritual Science at the Goetheanum in Dornach, Switzerland. He is married with five children. Christof Wiechert , who was the Leader of the Pedagogical Section in Dornach for over a decade, will offer a daily lecture to his own group as well as to partici- pants in the grade-specific courses. These are the titles of the lectures he will offer. 1. Man as a Microcosmic and Macrocosmic Being 2. Changes in the Constitution of man: Luciferic past, Ahrimanic Future I 3. Changes in the Constitution of man: Luciferic past, Ahrimanic Future II 4. The Education of the Will Center for Anthroposophy \u2014 Renewal Courses 2016 3WEEK 1 Grade 1: Laying the Foundation With Christopher Sblendorio Forming the first grade class is no easy task, but it can be great fun. It lays the foundation for all the learning that the children will encounter in elementary school. To put it modestly, this is a delicate process. We will learn how to make the celebrated \"morning circle\" a meaningful work of art, a drama that brings chaos into healthy movement, form, and order. We will learn how to awaken in children a love for letters, words, and reading. We will learn how to introduce the magical world of numbers and the four processes. We will make a start at building a repertoire of jolly songs and poems as well as profound stories and plays. We will discuss why loving the children and their parents and our work is the only way to succeed as a teacher. This will be a very practical \"hands-on\" course. Be prepared to skip about and sing, play the pentatonic recorder, draw and paint, and be really dramatic. Daily lecture by Christof Wiechert Music with David Gable (please bring pentatonic flute) Materials fee: $25 Christopher Sblendorio , after earning a university degree in education and studying at Emerson College, taught his first year at the Rudolf Steiner School in NYC. He then led four classes, first through eighth grades, at the Rudolf Steiner School in Great Barrington, MA. He now is teaching a new first grade in California at the Santa Cruz Waldorf School. He is also known as professional clown, musician, country dance caller, published writer\u2014in short a jack of all trades and master of none, except perhaps of teaching children how to have fun while learning. Center for Anthroposophy \u2014 Renewal Courses 2016 4 WEEK 1 Grade 2: Becoming the Knight & Taming the Dragons With Neal Kennerk Second grade is a golden year. It is a year of calm before the storm of the nine- year change. It is a year of duality...of light and dark, of good and bad, of will and impulse. To meet the child during this most important year, we call on the upright imagery of the Saints and the foibles of the Fables. The upright human being does not succumb to impulse as the animals of the Fables do - we bring the children great deeds and great follies. In addition, the overarching image of the knight juxtaposed to the dragon is another image of duality that serves the second grader throughout the year. This powerful imagery helps the children to discern right action as they move from the sympathetic to the more antipathetic - right action in the classroom as a growing human being, having left the early childhood impulse behind. It is time to stretch and deepen capacities academically and socially. It is time for emulation and discernment, as the etheric is freed and the astral gains familiarity. It is time to celebrate the twilight of childhood immortal...happily, enthusiastically, and golden. Activities: Drawing, Painting, Sculpture, Form Drawing, Singing, Movement, Flute (pentatonic) Music with David Gable (please bring pentatonic flute) Daily by Christof Wiechert Materials fees: $25 Neal Kennerk , a Waldorf teacher for 14 years that included four second grade classes, is currently teaching at White Mountain Waldorf School. A teacher of teachers for over a decade, he is the co-author of Out of the Garden and into the Desert . Center for Anthroposophy \u2014 Renewal Courses 2016 5Grade 3: Why Leave Paradise? With Darcy Drayton Leaving Paradise can be hard for teachers, children, and their parents, but with vision, courage, love for the world, and a well-stocked backpack this transition can be experienced as the first great adventure into the world at large. Like people in the Old Testament stories, the students are eager to practice the skills needed to make their way in the world. Over the course of the week we will unpack all of these elements to help plan the blocks for this upcoming year of teaching. We will cover all the math including measurement, language arts including grammar, writing in script and student compositions, painting, drawing and sculpting, planning for the farming and building project blocks, as well as ideas and possibilities for crafts, cooking, and other practical arts. Now that the children are ready for more individual roles and lines in the class play, we will explore ways to pick or write a play, then to organize the practice, costuming, and necessary blocking. We'll practice how to make changes in the circle to include playing the recorder, singing rounds, and we'll take on the beginning of reading music, dancing, practicing math skills, and spelling. All this allows the teacher the crucial opportunity to work with the social element in the class, so that the children work well together as a group. We will be sure to leave time to address challenges that arise from meeting needs of learning disabilities in some children in the class, as well as parent concerns, collegial relationships, teacher self-care, and the ever-important underpinning of Anthroposophy. Daily lecture with Christof Wiechert Music with David Gable bring soprano recorder) Materials fee: $25 Darcy Drayton , a graduate from Antioch University's Waldorf Teacher Education Program, has taken two classes through the full eight years at Pine Hill Waldorf School.

WEEK 1 Center for Anthroposophy \u2014 Renewal Courses 2016 6 WEEK 1 Grade 4: Stepping Out Into the World With Elizabeth Auer After a wonderful third grade year, busy with tending the garden and building shelters, fourth graders are ready to step out and explore the world around them. They are ready to learn about the surrounding hills and mountains, ponds and lakes, streams and rivers, deserts and oceans -- in short, to learn how they, as human beings, are part of the Kingdoms of Nature. With this spirit of exploration, we will look at how the wisdom of the Norse Myths addresses the needs of the ninth/tenth year as the younger years make way for a new awareness of time. We will look at grammar as it connects to the mysterious Norns of Destiny, who weave the thread of the past, the present, and the future. We will discover Odin's nine days of hanging on Yggdrasil, the World Tree, and find our way to the magic runes of the Futark. Finally, the might of Thor's hammer will fracture big rocks into many smaller pieces... Fractions! We'll look at how to write a class play involving main characters of the myths with Odin at the center. We'll create a diorama for an animal and its environment, draw a geography map, and paint a landscape. The fourth grade is a new step into life that calls for many new and exciting adventures! Music with David Gable (please bring soprano recorder) Daily lecture by Christof Wiechert Materials fee: $25 Elizabeth Auer , a graduate of Antioch's Waldorf Teacher Training program and the Remedial Resource Waldorf Teacher Training program, was a manual arts and class teacher for 18 years at the Pine Hill Waldorf School in New Hampshire.

She currently teaches drawing and handwork at Antioch University, Keene, NH, as well as working as a freelance consultant and educator. Center for Anthroposophy \u2014 Renewal Courses 2016 7WEEK 1 Grade 5: The Golden Bridge from Childhood to Adolescence, Lower School to the Upper Elementary School With Patrice Maynard In this important year of turning, when a child transforms into a self-directed learner, an imaginative master, and an exuberant memorizer, the teacher has a chance to consolidate all the efforts of the previous four years to launch students into these upper elementary school years with confidence and sound skills. The curriculum for fifth grade is rich and joyful, commanding every inch of a teacher's consciousness and preparation. Fifth grade builds teaching muscles for the coming school years as well as gathering students over the hill to self-mastery. A commanding overview, context setting, and preparation in the summer helps a teacher to proceed with gusto into this last year before the onset of adolescence. The fifth grade has in it for the class teacher: hand drawn geometry developed out of form drawing, recitation of substantial poetry with strong speech skills, singing in parts and increased musical literacy, build-up songs, coordination and concentration challenges, times tables, fractions, decimal fractions, mental calculation, paragraph structure and settled mastery of the parts of speech and sentence structure, complex dances, wet on dry watercolor, advanced drawing techniques, the Greek alphabet, the sweep of ancient civilizations, North American geography, early astronomy in Greek navigation, preparation for the Pentathlon, the class play, and more! How can the teacher meet the challenge of such rich curriculum with joy and enthusiasm? Tools of effective preparation, meditative practices, artistic approaches for the teacher are all means to the end of a solid and satisfying fifth grade year with your class. Come, and discover or re-discover these in a week prepared to be both restorative and rigorous! Music with David Gable (please bring soprano recorder) Daily lecture by Christof Wiechert Materials fee: $25 Patrice Maynard was a class teacher and a music teacher at the Hawthorne Valley Waldorf School for thirteen years before her current work in publishing and development with the Research Institute for Waldorf Education and nine years as leader for outreach and development for the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America.

She is the mother of three adult Waldorf graduates, an avid pursuer of poetry and singing, and a quilter. Center for Anthroposophy \u2014 Renewal Courses 2016 8 WEEK 1 Grade 6: The Turning Point of Childhood: With Helena Niiva Science with Roberto Trostli To land securely in sixth grade, a teacher has to appreciate the unquestionable authority of \"cause and effect.\" This plays out in Roman history and the transition from seven kings to republic and empire, in which common sense and the rule of law replace divine guidance. Sixth grade also involves teaching exactness through geometry and accurate observations through the sciences of geography, astronomy, physics, and geology. The English and Mathematics curriculum enjoys a strong dose of common sense, too, in the practice of writing business letters, as well as calculating the % for profit. Participants taking this Renewal Course will also have the opportunity to restore some levity through age-appropriate music, sword and/or morris dancing, and\u2014for those worthy of the event\u2014a knighting ceremony, which will provoke discussion around rites of passage and preparation for adolescence. Daily lecture with Christof Wiechert Mineralogy, Astronomy, and Physics with Roberto Trostli Materials fee: $25 Helena Niiva grew up in Finland, where she received her elementary teacher education degree from Jyvaskyla University, with specialization in music, speech, and special education. After working in Finland for several years, Helena moved to Stuttgart, Germany to begin her studies in anthroposophy. As a faculty member at the Lexington Waldorf School in Massachusetts, she has taught German and chorus, as well as directing a musical every spring. To prepare herself to become a class teacher, she took her Masters in Waldorf Education at Antioch University New England. Since then Helena has graduated two eighth grades and is currently teaching seventh grade. Roberto Trostli's biography may be found on page 13 of this brochure. Center for Anthroposophy \u2014 Renewal Courses 2016 9Grade 7: A Year of Exploration and Renaissance With Alison Henry Science with Roberto Trostli Seventh graders are ready for an experience of exploration and renaissance. They yearn to sail into the unknown, both frightened and thrilled by the risks they might face. From their teacher they demand something new, as well: they need a level-headed captain who knows when to stow and when to unfurl the sail. They need the skilled sculptor, who knows how to bring out the beauty of rough, sometimes uncooperative materials. Over the course of the week we will consider the task of the upcoming year in all its variety and challenge. At the center of our work will be a picture of the 12-13-year-old child. Starting with this picture, we will map out the curriculum, practicing methods and classroom management techniques that meet the needs of this age group. Expect both practical detail and broad discussion on topics ranging from block rotation and questions of homework, tests and grading, to parent work, choosing a class play, and finding a sustainable and nourishing rhythm as a teacher. Block content will include the Age of Exploration, Renaissance Europe, the Protestant Reformation, astronomy, African geography and ancient cultures, human physiology, algebra, and geometry. Singing with David Gable Physics and Chemistry with Roberto Trostli Materials fee: $25 Alison Henry is marking the end of an eight-year journey as a class teacher at Monadnock Waldorf School. Her initial graduate degree from Indiana University focused on the history and philosophy of education. Upon returning to the U.S. after years of teaching English overseas, Alison discovered Anthroposophy and its connection to Waldorf education; to her delight, she discovered that she lived less than a quarter-mile from Antioch University New England, where she earned her certificate in Waldorf elementary education. Alison draws great strength from such experiences of serendipity. Roberto Trostli's biography may be found on page 13 of this brochure.WEEK 1 Center for Anthroposophy \u2014 Renewal Courses 2016 10 Grade 8: The Crowning of the Waldorf Grade School With Signe Motter Science with Roberto Trostli In eighth grade, we embark on a journey that challenges teacher and students alike. A broader and deeper focus is needed, as the world expands before our eyes. To meet the growing nature of this age group, an eighth grade teacher needs to provide dynamic and structured inner, as well as outer, resources. This year is truly a culmination for all, and it can be an experience of exuberant teaching and learning! This is the year that covers modern world history, encompassing the Industrial, American, French, Russian, and Technological Revolutions. This course will also look at the abolitionists' and women's suffrage movements, the Civil War and the Reconstruction, as well as two World Wars, while providing deeper context for these seismic events in history. The topics of Slavery, Native Americans and Colonialism, and the Civil Rights Movement constitute a rude awakening, along with the great depression and the rise of Capitalism and Communism. In addition to the aforementioned topics, Africa will hold the focus of geographic studies for eighth grade, as it allows for coverage of meteorology, colonization, and some contemporary biographies related to the cultural diversity of the continent. To offset the historical base of our week together, we will delve into how to present the study of anatomy (muscles and bones), while also leaving space for eighth grade writing short stories and poetry. To foster a level of preparedness within our group, we will share materials and creative ideas for eighth grade resources, highlighting overall curriculum planning, exciting project opportunities, teacher-parent engagement, and the management of social dynamics. Two of the main texts to be referenced will be Practical Advice and Discussions With Teachers , as well as verses from Rudolf Steiner's Calendar of the Soul , all for the purpose of deepening the process for teachers about to embark upon an enriching year of growth for all involved.

Rudolf Steiner opened avenues of approach to these individualities in a manner which is often more far-reaching than the usual study of their biographies and deeds may reveal. Working with Rudolf Steiner's research concerning five such advanced human beings as well as with historical documents we will focus each day on one of the five: Scythianus and his Influence in the Ancient Hibernian and Black Sea Mysteries as well as Scythianus and the Orpheus Mysteries Gautama Buddha and his Past and Present Task for Humanity Master Jesus and his Service to Christ throughout the Ages Manes ' Development from the Ancient Mysteries to the Mysteries of Christianity and his Future Task Christian Rosenkreutz : Humanity's Current Human Leader as seen from his Spiritual Biography and his Present Task in the Age of Michael Eurythmy with Cezary Ciaglo and Clay Modeling with Elizabeth Auer Materials fee: $20 Virginia Sease was born in Pennsylvania and earned her doctorate in German from the University of Southern California. She taught in a university and a waldorf school in Los Angeles and served as a member of the Executive Council of the Anthroposophical Society at the Goetheanum from 1984 until her retirement in 2015. Virginia Sease remains a member of the leadership at the Goetheanum, with responsibilities within the General Anthroposophical Section of the School of Spiritual Science. She also coordinates speakers and lecture cycles given worldwide, as well as Class Lessons at the Goetheanum, and leads the Anthroposophical Studies Program in English. Center for Anthroposophy \u2014 Renewal Courses 2016 15WEEK 2 The Human Embryo - A Lifelong Journey in Search of Spirit With Jaap van der Wal, MD \"My passion however was and still is human embryology. The human body is a process, developing and functioning in time. The embryo moves and behaves in forms. It is in this area that I encountered the Goethean phenomenological approach. I apply the method of dynamic morphology to understand what we actually are doing as human beings when we still are embryo. With humility I can find in the embryo cautious answers to questions as to the meaning of human existence.\" - Jaap van der Wal Jaap van der Wal travels around the globe giving workshops in which he tries to bridge mainstream biology and science generally and a spiritual view of the human being. He explores human prenatal development and how the shaping of the body (morphogenesis) expresses essential attributes of the development of the human as a being of spirit and matter, of body and mind. Drawing upon the scientific method of phenomenology, he creates a synthesis between modern embryology and a holistic view of the human being. Approached in this way, the human embryo reveals not only who we are but also what we are meant to be, challenging the modern reductionist view of humans as being merely 'walking brains' and 'surviving genomes'. Waldorf teachers, health care practitioners and therapists, and people interested in or working from the anthroposophical image of man and nature will benefit from this course as they learn to comprehend embryological forces in this holistic approach. All will discover that the same forces that formed the body are continuously at work throughout life, bringing the blueprint of health into manifestation: the Embryo in us. For Waldorf teachers and anthroposophical therapists, it may be helpful to learn that it is possible and well founded to teach issues of modern biology and medicine within the frame of an anthroposophical or spiritual image of man and nature. Activities: Clay Modeling and Drawing Materials fee: $20 Jaap van der Wal, MD , is a medical doctor who until his recent retirement in 2012 worked as Associate Professor in Anatomy and Embryology at the University of Maastricht, Holland. After his medical education in 1973 he specialized in the functional anatomy of the locomotor apparatus. Gradually he developed as teacher in Philosophy of Science and in Medical Anthropology. He now fully devotes his energy to Embryo in Motion , a world-wide project on teaching \"Embryosophy.\" Center for Anthroposophy \u2014 Renewal Courses 2016 16 WEEK 2 The 9 Subtle Bodies: A Comprehensive Survey of the Dynamic Interrelationships between the Physical and Life Bodies, the three Soul Bodies and the Human Spirit. With Dennis Klocek The model that Rudolf Steiner gave for the human being is quite complex. There is sometimes confusion expressed around what is a life body in contrast to the physical body. Then again, is the sentient body the same thing as the sentient soul? And what about the \"I\"? Is it part of the soul or not? These questions and many more will be explored in a deepening study of the human being's nine subtle bodies. Using examples from embryology, neurology, and psychology, the course will follow the evolution of the human being from spiritual existence down into physical existence and back again into the spirit. Emphasis will be placed on the seven-year developmental phases as the basis for teaching and learning strategies. Eurythmy with Cezary Ciaglo Materials fee: $10 Dennis Klocek offers a three-week Consciousness Studies program every August at Rudolf Steiner College. For the rest of the year he gives workshops on many themes in many communities here and abroad. Dennis is the founder of Coros Institute, a not- for-profit organization that sponsors dialogues focused on how meditative life affects one's work in the world. Three separate offerings each year cover themes in Biodynamics, esoteric practice, and alchemical world view and practices. Dennis also provides yearly long-range weather forecasts for agricultural interests in Sonoma County, California. Plans for a shorter-term phone app for Bay Area weather are in progress. Dennis has written nine books with a new book just about to be published by Steinerbooks on the subject of esoteric physiology. The book is a compilation of thirteen Coros lectures on the human body. Center for Anthroposophy \u2014 Renewal Courses 2016 17WEEK 2 Picasso and Leonardo da Vinci: Exploring Individuality in Dark and Light With Donald Hall and Sylvie Richard \"Discipline is the cornerstone of freedom, not its opposite.\" - Marie-Agn\u00e8s Gillot This painting course will deepen the artistic process by exploring the difference between subjective and objective in the use of color and form in painting. The artist is always in danger of getting stuck in the subjective or fluctuating between these two poles. The task of our time is to join the two poles of subjective and objective in a \"process of play or in a process of freedom\" as brought forth by Friedrich Schiller in his aesthetic letters on the education of the artist and the human being. The human being and the artist in the act of freedom: both must become one. Goethe's color theory and Steiner's color lectures teach us of the mystery and secrets of color, indicating a path that help us not to fall into the shadows of our own consciousness, or to blindly follow others. Eurythmy as an artistic practice embodies objective spiritual realities. It invites us to ensoul and embody \"the thing in itself\" through movement. To support the painting process we will explore how the various aspects and movements in painting can be perceived, ensouled, and embodied through various elements of eurythmy (space, time, the four elements, colors, and sounds) as a discipline and an anchor to objective reality \u2014 in short, as a step towards freedom. The day will be devoted mainly to painting, with two short eurythmy interludes. We will practice the inner and outer technique of color application in Surface as observation Light and Dark as movement Line as expression of order We will work through a color process: simple to complex to simple again, as it may be observed in nature.

Picasso and Leonardo da Vinci: Exploring Individuality in Dark and Light (Instructors) Center for Anthroposophy \u2014 Renewal Courses 2016 19WEEK 2 Pushing the Boundaries of the Imagination through Projective Geometry With Jamie York Did you ever wish that you had been a Waldorf student so that you could take some of those classic, yet mysterious, courses that only Waldorf students are privileged to experience? In terms of mathematics, that course is projective geometry, in which eleventh graders get to bend their minds around (and through!) infinity. Here is your chance! Join us as we blend the elements of art, math, and imagination. Even though this mysterious topic eluded mathematicians for more than 2,000 years, it is equally fascinating and accessible to both the mathematically adept and the mathematically timid. Participants will find their concept of geometry greatly altered as they experience infinity through drawing and in their imagination. The course will approach the vast subject of projective geometry by starting with simple geometric drawings and then studying the relationships that emerge as these drawing are altered. While much will be learned through drawing, the course will also involve discussions and will include the historical roots of how projective geometry shook the previously firm foundation of geometry. The course is tailored for the math teacher, the math enthusiast, and the math timid. The only prerequisites for participation in the course are open- mindedness, enthusiasm, and a desire to stretch one's imagination. Eurythmy with Cezary Ciaglo Materials fee: $10 Jaime York , after earning two computer science degrees, began teaching math in 1985 at a boarding school in New Hampshire. In 1994, after spending two years in Nepal as a Peace Corps volunteer, Jamie's search for meaningful education led him to the Shining Mountain Waldorf School in Boulder, Colorado, where he is still teaching elementary and high school mathematics. Jamie consults and teaches math workshops at a variety of schools around the world, and serves on the faculty at the Center for Anthroposophy training Waldorf high school math teachers. He is the lead author of the Making Math Meaningful series of math books. Center for Anthroposophy \u2014 Renewal Courses 2016 20 WEEK 2 Personal and Organizational Change With Leonore Russell and Torin M. Finser Schools face many challenges today. \"Peeling the onion,\" one finds that behind external issues of deficits, low salaries, interpersonal conflict, and lack of support for leadership there is often an underlying need to rekindle the sources of inspiration and find a more collaborative approach. By bringing together the various groups represented in a typical school, this course attempts to model new ways of working together. Our classrooms feature the magic of seeing the \"whole child\"; can our organizations learn to embrace whole-systems thinking? This course is for parents, teachers, administrators, and board members interested in school renewal. Topics will include: group dynamics, leadership styles, the wisdom of human physiology and the planets, working with conflict, communication, mediation, artistic practice, and finding the balance between personal and professional demands. These themes will be supported through exercises from \"Eurythmy in the Workplace.\" Participants will take up some of the current issues facing their schools and design strategies to work toward closer collaboration. It is recommended for present and future participants in the Waldorf Admin. Program at Antioch. Suggested texts: School Renewal and A Second Classroom , both by Torin Finser Leonore Russell , having \"Eurythmy in the Workplace\" training with Anne-Marie Erhlich, uses this approach in her work with adult education, organizational development, businesses, and non-profits. Leonore runs her own consulting service, Understanding and Managing Change, and collaborates with Torin Finser as well as the company AdminService. Leonore earned her Eurythmy Diploma from the Goetheanum in Switzerland and has received degrees in both the Visual and Performing Arts from Sarah Lawrence College and Adelphi University.

Center for Anthroposophy \u2014 Renewal Courses 2016 21WEEK 2 Experience Metal Color Light Therapy: A New Initiative With Lisa Edge and Helena Hurrell \"The mortal rumbles in its foundations, but the immortal begins to shine brighter, and becomes self aware.\" - Novalis What happens when we see color through natural light? What qualities do the metals offer when they have been transformed into colored glass through the heating/warming process? What are the possibilities for our own transformation? These are some of the questions we will explore in this course, which will introduce this relatively new therapy, recognized and certified by the Medical Section at the Goetheanum in Switzerland and developed by a research project begun in 2001. The glass, which is manufactured by Lucien Turci in a small atelier in Schw\u00f6rstadt, Germany, was introduced by the late Marianne Altmaier, who was inspired by the healing and interactive qualities of the beautiful colored windows of the Goetheanum. Metal Color Light Therapy (MCLT) is now being used in hospitals, schools, clinics, and in private practices in Germany, England, Sweden, and most recently the United States. In our week together we will be working with the glass panels through direct observation, sharing our experiences and working individually with the \"after image\" through painting, creative writing, and fairy tales. There will be singing, music, and Nurturing Arts to balance the day. We will offer case studies and a short film about Metal Colored Light Therapy. In addition to our encounters with the glass, we will discuss possibilities for the usefulness of this new therapy: what are the applications and for whom? Please come join us in exploring new healing approaches and finding ways to nurture oneself through the arts. No prior artistic experience necessary.

Gnaw? With Winter When we \"write from out of the picture,\" we hone imagination, clarify thinking, and gain objectivity. In this hands-on course, we'll practice exercises to sharpen outer observation and memory; we'll strengthen as well the inner eye needed to craft precise, accurate, and inherently logical narratives. This congenial yet potent method will include Dorit's \"Simple Rules for Better Writing.\" Our efforts will culminate in a fabricated\u2014but true\u2014short short story. Whether you work in an office, write sentences for children, or just want to be more precise, you'll find your way to the essence of a sentence while at the same time honoring Rudolf Steiner's injunction to \"ground education in the pictorial.\" Our focus on disciplined writing in the context of Steiner's many references to the importance of image and emblem will broaden our understanding of why imagination is so central to the practice of Waldorf education and anthroposophy.
