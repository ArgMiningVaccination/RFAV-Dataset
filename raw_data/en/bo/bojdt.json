This book is a testosterone- based, voluntary intoxication protocol, which concerns the body and affects of BP . A body-essay. Fiction, actually. If things must be pushed to the extreme, this is a somato - p olitical fiction, a theory of the self, or self-theory. During the time period covered by this essay, two external transfor - mations follow on each other in the context of the experi-mental body, the impact of which couldn't be calculated beforehand and cannot be taken into account as a function of the study; but it created the limits around which writing was incorporated. First of all, there is the death of GD, the human distillation of a vanishing epoch, an icon, and the ultimate French representative of a form of written sexual insurrection; almost simultaneously, there is the tropism of BP's body in the direction of VD's body, an opportunity for perfection\u2014and for ruin. This is a record of physiologi-cal and political micromutations provoked in BP's body by testosterone, as well as the theoretical and physical changes incited in that body by loss, desire, elation, failure, or renouncement. I'm not interested in my emotions inso-much as their being mine, belonging only, uniquely, to me. I'm not interested in their individual aspects, only in how they are traversed by what isn't mine. In what emanates from our planet's history, the evolution of living species, the flux of economics, remnants of technological innova-tions, preparation for wars, the trafficking of organic slaves and commodities, the creation of hierarchies, institutions of punishment and repression, networks of communica-tion and surveillance, the random overlapping of market research groups, techniques and blocs of opinion, the bio-chemical transformation of feeling, the production and distribution of pornographic images. Some will read this text as a manual for a kind of gender bioterrorism on a molecular scale. Others will see in it a single point in a car - tography of extinction. In this text, the reader won't come to any definitive conclusion about the truth of my sex, or predictions about the world to come. I present these pages as an account of theoretical junctions, molecules, affects, in order to leave a trace of a political experiment that lasted 236 days and nights and that continues today under other forms. If the reader sees this text as an uninterrupted series of philosophical reflections, accounts of hormone admin-istration, and detailed records of sexual practices without the solutions provided by continuity, it is simply because this is the mode on which subjectivity is constructed and deconstructed.12 I ntroductionQuestion: If you could see a documentary on a philosopher, on Heidegger, Kant, or Hegel, what would you like to see in it?

(New York: Zeitgeist Video, 2003), DVD. 15October 5: Tim tells me you've died. He's crying. He loves you. However, in your last books, you didn't treat him with generosity. He says, \"It's William.\" He's crying, repeats, \"It's William, it's William. We found him dead in his new apartment in Paris. We don't know. It happened two days ago, on the third. We just don't know.\" Until now, no one was aware of your death. You rotted for two days in the same position in which you had fallen. It's better like that. No one came to bother you. They left you alone with your body, the time necessary for abandon-ing in peace all that misery. I cry with Tim. It can't be. I hang up, and the first thing I do is call VD\u2014I don't know why. We've seen each other twice. Once, alone. You're the one who pushes me to dial her number. You listen to our conversation. Your mind unfurls and forms an electro-magnetic layer from which our words flow. Your ghost is a wire transmitting our voices. As we talk about your death, her voice awakens the life in me. The strongest is his voice, I think, 1 you were saying. I don't dare cry when talking with her. I hang up, and then I cry, alone. Because you didn't want to keep living and because, as your godfather would say, \"a dead poet writes no more.\" 21. Your death 1. Guillaume Dustan, Nicolas Pages (Paris: Editions Balland, 1999), autres textes (Paris: Librio, 1997), 19.That same day, a few hours later, I put a fifty-milligram dose of Testogel on my skin, so that I can begin to write this book. It isn't the first time. This is my usual dose. The carbon chains, O-H3, C-H3, C-OH, gradually penetrate my epidermis and travel through the deep layers of my skin until they reach the blood vessels, nerve endings, glands. I'm not taking testosterone to change myself into a man or as a physical strategy of transsexualism; I take it to foil what society wanted to make of me, so that I can write, fuck, feel a form of pleasure that is postpornographic, add a molecular prostheses to my low-tech transgender identity composed of dildos, texts, and moving images; I do it to avenge your death. Vide Opene TraT i O n I'd rather go blind than to see you walk away. \u2014et ta James 8:35 p.m. Your spirit comes through the window and dark - ens the room. I turn on all the lights. Put a blank cassette in the video camera and screw the camera to the tripod. I check the framing. The image is smooth and symmetrical; the black leather couch forms a horizontal line at the bot - tom of the frame. The white wall easily follows that line, but without creating any feeling of volume or relief. Play. I move to the sofa. Off camera, on the coffee table, I've left electric clippers, a small mirror, a sheet of white paper, a 16 Y our Deathplastic bag, a bottle of hypoallergenic glue for use on the face, a dose of fifty milligrams of testosterone in gel form, a tube of lubricant, anal-dilator gel, a harness with a realistic rubber dildo (9\u00bd x 1\u00bd in.), a realistic black silicone dildo (9\u00be x 2\u00bd in.), a black ergonomic one (5\u00bd x \u00be in.), a razor and shaving cream, a plastic basin filled with water, a white towel, and one of your books, the first, the sublime one, the beginning and end of everything. I walk into the frame. Get undressed, but not completely. Keep my black tank top on. As if for surgery, I expose only those organs on which the instruments will be working. I stand the mirror up on the table. I plug in the electric clippers. A sharp, high-pitched sound, the voice of a cyberchild trying to get out of the motor, spitting in the face of the past. I adjust the blades of the comb to a width of one centimeter. Your spirit sends me a discrete sound of approval. I sit on the couch, and one half of my face\u2014looking expressionless, centerless\u2014appears in the mirror: my short black hair; contact lenses, whose edges create a thin halo around the iris; patchy skin; very white in places and flecked with bright pink in others. I was labeled a woman, but that's imperceptible in the par - tial image reflected in the mirror. I begin shaving my head, starting at the front and moving backward, then from the middle toward the left, then toward the right. I bend for - ward so that the locks drop onto the table. I open the plas - tic bag and slide the hair into it. Turn off the machine and adjust the comb to zero. I place a sheet of white paper on the table, then turn the clippers back on and move them again over my entire head. Short, very thin hairs rain onto Your Death 17the white paper. When my head is completely smooth, I unplug the machine. I fold the sheet of paper in two, so that the hairs collect at the center, forming a uniform line. A line of black cocaine. I'm doing up a line of hair. It's almost the same high. I open the jar of glue and add a streak of it above my upper lip with the moistened brush, then take a strand of hair between my fingers and set it along the streak of glue until it sticks perfectly to the skin of my face. A fag's mustache. I check myself out in the mirror. My eyes have the same halo around the iris. Same face, skin. Identical yet unrecognizable. I look into the camera, curl back my lip to show my teeth, the way you do it. It's your gesture. The silver package containing a fifty-milligram dose of testosterone in gel form is the same size as a small packet of sugar. I rip into the aluminum-coated paper; out comes a thin, cold, transparent gel that disappears immediately into the skin of my left shoulder. A cool vapor remains, like a memory of icy breath, the kiss of a snowwoman. I shake the can of shaving cream, deposit a ball of expanding white lather on my palm, then cover the hairs of my pubes, the lips of my vulva and the skin surround-ing my anus with it. I dip the blade in water and begin to shave. Hairs and cream float to the surface. A few splashes fall onto the couch or the floor. This time I don't cut myself. When all the skin on my crotch has been shaved, I rinse off and dry. Slip on the harness and buckle the straps at the side of each hip. In front of me, the dildo is super erect, forming a right angle with the line of my vertebral column. The dildo belt is high enough to allow me to see two very distinct orifices when I bend down.18 Y our DeathI coat my hands with transparent gel and pick up the two dildos. I rub, lubricate, warm them, one in each hand, then one against the other, like two giant cocks twisting against each other in a gay porn film. I know the camera is filming because I can see the red light blinking. I dangle my silicone cock over the paragraphs tattooed across the pages of Dans ma chambre. 3 It's your gesture. The dildo con- ceals part of the page, creating a barrier that allows certain words to be read and hides others: \"We laughed. He went with me in the car. I looked at him. His hand signaled me before / night fell. I know that I would have had to / I'll never be in love with him. But how wonderful it was that he loved me. It was good.\" 4 Next I slide the dildos into the openings at the lower part of my body. First, the realistic-looking one, then the ergonomic one, which goes into my anus. It's always easier for me to put something into my anus, which is a multidi-mensional space without any bony edges. This time, it's the same. On my knees, I turn my back to the camera, the tips of my feet and my head pressing against the floor, and hold my arms behind me so that they can manage the two dildos in my orifices. You're the only one who could read this book. In front of this camera, \"for the first time I'm tempted to make a self-portrait for you.\" 5 Design an image of myself as if I were you. Do you in drag. Cross-dress into you. Bring you back to life with this image. 3. In My Room, the first novel of French gay writer Guillaume Dustan.\u2014Trans. Death 19From this moment on, all of you are dead. Amelia, Herv\u00e9, Michel, Karen, Jackie, Teo, and You. Do I belong more to your world than I do to the world of the living? Isn't my politics yours; my house, my body, yours? Reincarnate yourselves in me, take over my body like extraterrestrials took over Americans and changed them into living sheaths. Reincarnate yourself in me; possess my tongue, arms, sex organs, dildos, blood, molecules; possess my girlfriend, dog; inhabit me, live in me. Come. Ven . Please don't leave. Vuelve a la vida. Come back to life. Hold on to my sex. Low, down, dirty. Stay with me. This book has no other reason for being outside the mar - gin of uncertainty existing between me and my sex organs, all imaginary, between three languages that don't belong to me, between the alive you and the dead you, between my desire to carry on your line and the impossibility of restor - ing your sperm, between your eternal and silent books and the flood of words that are in a hurry to come out of my fingers, between testosterone and my body, between V and my love for V . Looking into the camera again: \"This testos - terone is for you, this pleasure is for you.\" I don't watch the mini-DV I just filmed. I don't even number it. I put it into its transparent red case and write on the label: October 3, 2005. day of your death. The preceding and following days are marked by my ritual of testosterone administration. It's a home protocol; it would 20 Y our Deatheven be a secret and private one if each of these adminis - trations weren't being filmed and sent anonymously to an Internet page on which hundreds of transgender, mutating bodies all over the planet are exchanging techniques and know-how. On this audiovisual network, my face is imma-terial, my name of no significance. Only the strict relation-ship between my body and the substance is a cult object, an object of surveillance. I spread the gel over my shoulders. First instant: the feeling of a light slap on the skin. The feeling changes into one of coldness before it disappears. Then, nothing for a day or two. Nothing. Waiting. Then, an extraordinary lucidity settles in, gradually, accompanied by an explosion of the desire to fuck, walk, go out everywhere in the city. This is the climax in which the spiritual force of the testosterone mixing with my blood takes to the fore. Absolutely all the unpleasant sensations disappear. Unlike speed, the movement going on inside has nothing to do with agitation, noise. It's simply the feeling of being in per - fect harmony with the rhythm of the city. Unlike with coke, there is no distortion in the perception of self, no logor - rhea or any feeling of superiority. Nothing but the feeling of strength reflecting the increased capacity of my muscles, my brain. My body is present to itself. Unlike with speed and coke, there is no immediate comedown. A few days go by, and the movement inside calms, but the feeling of strength, like a pyramid revealed by a sandstorm, remains. How can I explain what is happening to me? What can I do about my desire for transformation? What can I do about all the years I defined myself as a feminist? What kind of Your Death 21feminist am I today: a feminist hooked on testosterone, or a transgender body hooked on feminism? I have no other alternative but to revise my classics, to subject those theo-ries to the shock that was provoked in me by the practice of taking testosterone. To accept the fact that the change happening in me is the metamorphosis of an era.22 Y our Death23i was born in 1970. The automobile industry, which had reached its peak, was beginning to decline. My father had the first and most prominent garage in Burgos, a Gothic city full of parish priests and members of the military, where Franco had set up the new symbolic capital of fas - cist Spain. If Hitler had won the war, the new Europe would have been established around two obviously unequal poles, Burgos and Berlin. At least, that was the little Galician gen-eral's dream. Garage Central was located on rue du General Mola, named after the soldier who in 1936 led the uprising against the Republican regime. The most expensive cars in the city, belonging to the rich and to dignitaries of the Franco regime, were kept there. In my house there were no books, just cars. Some Chrysler Motor Slant Sixes; several Renault Gordinis, Dauphines, and Ondines (nicknamed \"widows' cars,\" because they had the reputation of skidding on curves and killing husbands at the wheel); some Citro\u00ebn DSs (which the Spanish called \"sharks\"); and several Stan-dards brought back from England and reserved for doctors. I should add the collection of antique cars that my father had put together little by little: a black \"Lola Flores\" Mer Citro\u00ebn with engine, a seventeen-horsepower Ford, a Dodge Dart Swinger, a 1928 Citro\u00ebn with its \"frog's ass,\" and a Cadillac with eight cyl-inders. At the time, my father was investing in brickyard industries, which (like the dictatorship, coincidentally) would begin to decline in 1975 with the gas crisis. In the end, he had to sell his car collection to make up for the col-lapse of the factory. I cried about it. Meanwhile, I was grow - ing up like a tomboy. My father cried about it. During that bygone yet not-so-long-ago era that we today call Fordism, the automobile and mass-produced suburban housing industries synthesized and perfected a specific mode of production and consumption, a Tay - lorist temporal organization of life characterized by a sleek polychrome aesthetic of the inanimate object, a way of conceiving of inner space and urban living, a conflictual arrangement of the body and the machine, a discontinu-ous flow of desire and resistance. In the years following the energy crisis and the decline of the assembly line, people sought to identify new growth sectors in a transformed global economy. That is when \"experts\" began talking about biochemical, electronic, computing, or communications industries as new industrial props of capitalism . . . But these discourses won't be enough to explain the production of added value and the metamorphosis of life in contempo-rary society. It is, however, possible to sketch out a new cartography of the transformations in industrial production during the previous century, using as an axis the political and technical management of the body, sex, and identity. In other words, 24 Th e Pharmacopornographic er ait is philosophically relevant today to undertake a somato- political1 analysis of \"world-economy.\"2 From an economic perspective, the transition toward a third form of capitalism, after the slave-dependent and industrial systems, is generally situated somewhere in the 1970s; but the establishment of a new type of \"government of the living\" 3 had already emerged from the urban, physi- cal, psychological, and ecological ruins of World War II\u2014or, in the case of Spain, from the Civil War. How did sex and sexuality become the main objects of political and economic activity? Follow me: The changes in capitalism that we are wit - nessing are characterized not only by the transformation of \"gender,\" \"sex,\" \"sexuality,\" \"sexual identity,\" and \"pleasure\" into objects of the political management of living (just as Foucault had suspected in his biopolitical description of new systems of social control), but also by the fact that this management itself is carried out through the new dynam-ics of advanced technocapitalism, global media, and bio-technologies. During the Cold War, the United States put more money into scientific research about sex and sexual-ity than any other country in history. The application of surveillance and biotechnologies for governing civil society 1. I refer here to Foucault's notion \"somato-pouvoir\" and \"technologie politique du corps.\" See de la prison (Paris: Gallimard, 4-6. 2. Here I draw on the well-known expression used by Immanuel Wallerstein in World- Systems Analysis: An Introduction (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2004). 3. Foucault, \"Du des vivants (1979-1980),\" a 25started during the late 1930s: the war was the best labo- ratory for molding the body, sex, and sexuality. The nec - ropolitical techniques of the war will progressively become biopolitical industries for producing and controlling sexual subjectivities. Let us remember that the period between the beginning of World War II and the first years of the Cold War constitutes a moment without precedent for women's visibility in public space as well as the emergence of visible and politicized forms of homosexuality in such unexpected places as, for example, the American army. 4 Alongside this social development, American McCarthyism\u2014rampant throughout the 1950s\u2014added to the patriotic fight against communism the persecution of homosexuality as a form of antinationalism while at the same time exalting the family values of masculine labor and domestic maternity. 5 Mean - while, architects Ray and Charles Eames collaborated with the American army to manufacture small boards of molded plywood to use as splints for mutilated appendages. A few years later, the same material was used to build furniture that came to exemplify the light design of modern American disposable architecture. 6 During the twentieth century, the \"invention\" of the biochemical notion of the hormone and the pharmaceutical development of synthetic molecules for commercial uses radically modified traditional definitions of normal and pathological sexual identities. In 1941, the first natural molecules of progesterone and estrogens were 4.

The same year, George Henry carried out the first demographic study of \"sexual deviation,\" a quantita-tive study of masses known as Sex Variants. 7 The Kinsey Reports on human sexual behavior (1948 and 1953) and Robert Stoller's protocols for \"femininity\" and \"masculin-ity\" (1968) followed in sexological suit. In 1957, the North American pedo-psychiatrist John Money coined the term \"gender,\" differentiating it from the traditional term \"sex,\" to define an individual's inclusion in a culturally recognized group of \"masculine\" or \"feminine\" behavior and physi-cal expression. Money famously affirms that it is possible (using surgical, endocrinological, and cultural techniques) to \"change the gender of any baby up to 18 months.\" 8 Between 1946 and 1949 Harod Gillies was performing the first phalloplastic surgeries in the UK, including work on Michael Dillon, the first female-to-male transsexual to have taken testosterone as part of the masculinization protocol. 9 In 1952, US soldier George W. Jorgensen was transformed into Christine, the first transsexual person discussed widely in the popular press. During the early 50s and into the 60s, physician Harry Benjamin systematized the clinical use of hormonal molecules in the treatment of \"sex change\" and 7.

The Pharmacopornographic er a 27defined \"transsexualism,\" a term first introduced in 1954, as a curable condition.10 The invention of the contraceptive pill, the first bio- chemical technique enabling the separation between het - erosexual practice and reproduction, was a direct result of the expansion of endocrinological experimentation, and triggered a process of development of what could be called, twisting the Eisenhower term, \"the sex-gender industrial complex.\" 11 In 1957, Searle & Co. commercialized Enovid, the first contraceptive pill (\"the Pill\") made of a combina-tion of mestranol and norethynodrei. First promoted for the treatment of menstrual disorders, the Pill was approved for contraceptive use four years later. The chemical compo-nents of the Pill would soon become the most used pharma-ceutical molecules in the whole of human history. 12 The Cold War was also a period of transformation of the governmental and economic regulations concerning pornography and prostitution. In 1946, elderly sex worker and spy Martha Richard convinced the French govern-ment to declare the \"maison closes \" illegal, which ended the nineteenth-century governmental system of brothels in France. In 1953, Hugh Hefner founded Playboy , the first North American \"porn\" magazine to be sold at newspaper stands, with a photograph of Marilyn Monroe naked as the 10. Whereas homosexuality was withdrawn from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in 1973, in 1983, gender identity disorder (clinical form of transsexuality) was included in the DSM with diagnostic criteria for this new pathology. 11.

In 1959, Hefner trans - formed an old Chicago house into the Playboy Mansion, which was promoted within the magazine and on television as a \"love palace\" with thirty-two rooms, becoming soon the most popular American erotic utopia. In 1972, Gerard Damiano produced Deep Throat. The film, starring Linda Lovelace, was widely commercialized in the US and became one of the most watched movies of all times, grossing more than $600 million. From this time on, porn film production boomed, from thirty clandestine film producers in 1950 to over 2,500 films in 1970. If for years pornography was the dominant visual tech- nology addressed to the male body for controlling his sex - ual reaction, during the 1950s the pharmaceutical industry looked for ways of triggering erection and sexual response using surgical and chemical prostheses. In 1974, Soviet Victor Konstantinovich Kalnberz patented the first penis implant using polyethylene plastic rods as a treatment for impotency, resulting in a permanently erect penis. These implants were abandoned for chemical variants because they were found to be \"physically uncomfortable and emotionally disconcerting.\" In 1984 Tom F . Lue, Emil A. Tanaghoy, and Richard A. Schmidt implanted a \"sexual pacemaker\" in the penis of a patient. The contraption was a system of electrodes inserted close to the prostate that permited an erection by remote control. The molecule of sildenafil (commercialized as Viagra \u00a9 by Pfizer laboratories in 1988) will later become the chemical treatment for \"erec - tile dysfunction.\" The Pharmacopornographic er a 29During the Cold War years psychotropic techniques first developed within the military were extended to medical and recreational uses for the civil population. In the 1950s, the United States Central Intelligence Agency performed a series of experiments involving electroshock techniques as well as psychedelic and hallucinogen drugs as part of a pro-gram of \"brainwashing,\" military interrogation, and psy - chological torture. The aim of the experimental program of the CIA was to identify the chemical techniques able to directly modify the prisoner's subjectivity, inflecting levels of anxiety, dizziness, agitation, irritability, sexual excite-ment, or fear. 13 At the same time, the laboratories Eli Lilly (Indiana) commercialized the molecule called Methadone (the most simple opiate) as an analgesic and Secobarbital, a barbiturate with anaesthetic, sedative, and hypnotic prop-erties conceived for the treatment of epilepsy, insomnia, and as an anaesthetic for short surgery. Secobarbital, better known as \"the red pill\" or \"doll,\" became one of the drugs of the rock underground culture of the 1960s. 14 In 1977, the state of Oklahoma introduced the first lethal injection composed of barbiturates similar to \"the red pill\" to be used for the death penalty. 15 The Cold War military space race was also the site of production of a new form of technological embodiment. 13. On the use of chemicals for military purposes during the Cold War years see: Naomi Klein, \"The Torture Lab,\" in The Schock Doctrine (New York: Penguin, 2007), 25-48. 14. Methadone became in the 70s the basic substitution treatment for heroine addiction. See: Tom Carnwath and Ian Smith, Heroin Century (New York: Routledge, 2002), 40-42. 15. The same method had already been applied in a Nazi German program called \"Action T4\" for \"racial hygiene\" that euthanatized between 75,000 and 100,000 people with physical or psychic disabilities. It was abandoned because of the high pharmacological cost; instead it was substituted by gas chambers or simply death caused by inanition.30 Th e Pharmacopornographic er aAt the start of the 60s, Manfred E.

Kline used the term \"cyborg\" for the first time to refer to an organism technologically supplemented to live in an extraterrestrial environment where it could operate as an \"integrated homeostatic system.\" 16 They experimented with a laboratory rat, which received an osmotic prosthe-sis implant that it dragged along\u2014a cyber tail. Beyond the rat, the cyborg named a new techno-organic condition, a sort of \"soft machine\" 17 (to use a Burroughs term) or a body with \"electric skin\" (to put it in Haus-Rucker & Co. terms) subjected to new forms of political control but also able to develop new forms of resistance. During the 1960s, as part of a military investigation program, Arpanet was created; it was the predecessor of the global Internet, the first \"net of nets\" of interconnected computers capable of transmitting information. On the other hand, the surgical techniques developed for the treatment of \"les geules cass\u00e9es\" of the First World War and the skin reconstruction techniques specially invented for the handling of the victims of the nuclear bomb will be transformed during the 1950s and 1960s into cosmetic and sexual surgeries. 18 In response to the threat inferred by Nazism and racist rhetoric, which claims that racial or religious differences can be detected in anatomical signs, \"de-circumcision,\" the artificial reconstruction of foreskin, was one of the most practiced cosmetic surgery operations 16.

Andy Warhol had himself photographed during a facelift, transforming his own body into a bio-pop object. Meanwhile, the use of a viscous, semi-rigid material that is waterproof, thermally and electrically resistant, produced by artificial propagation of carbon atoms in long chains of molecules of organic compounds derived from petroleum, and whose burning is highly polluting, became generalized in manufacturing the objects of daily life. DuPont, who pioneered the development of plastics from the 1930s on, was also implicated in nuclear research for the Manhattan project. 20 Together with plastics, we saw the exponential multiplication of the production of transura-nic elements (the chemical elements with atomic numbers greater than 92\u2014the atomic number of Uranium), which became the material to be used in the civil sector, includ-ing plutonium, that had, before, been used as nuclear fuel in military operations. 21 The level of toxicity of transuranic elements exceeds that of any other element on earth, cre-ating a new form of vulnerability for life. Cellulosic, poly - nosic, polyamide, polyester, acrylic, polypylene, spandex, etc., became materials used equally for body consumption and architecture. The mass consumption of plastic defined 19.

The Trash Vortex, a floating mass the size of Texas in the North Pacific made of plastic garbage, was to become the largest water architecture of the twenty-first century. 22 We are being confronted with a new kind of hot, psy - chotropic, punk capitalism. Such recent transformations are imposing an ensemble of new microprosthetic mecha-nisms of control of subjectivity by means of biomolecular and multimedia technical protocols. Our world economy is dependent on the production and circulation of hundreds of tons of synthetic steroids and technically transformed organs, fluids, cells (techno-blood, techno-sperm, techno-ovum, etc.), on the global diffusion of a flood of porno-graphic images, on the elaboration and distribution of new varieties of legal and illegal synthetic psychotropic drugs (e.g., bromazepam, Special K, Viagra, speed, crystal, Prozac, ecstasy, poppers, heroin), on the flood of signs and circuits of the digital transmission of information, on the exten-sion of a form of diffuse urban architecture to the entire planet in which megacities of misery are knotted into high concentrations of sex-capital. 23 These are just some snapshots of a postindustrial, global, and mediatic regime that, from here on, I will call pharmacopornographic . The term refers to the processes of a biomolecular (pharmaco) and semiotic-technical (porno- 22. Susan Freinkel, Plastic: A Toxic Love Story (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2011). 23.

Although their lines of force may be rooted in the scientific and colo-nial society of the nineteenth century, their economic vec - tors become visible only at the end of World War II. Hidden at first under the guise of a Fordist economy, they reveal themselves in the 1970s with the gradual collapse of this phenomenon. During the second half of the twentieth century, the mechanisms of the pharmacopornographic regime are materialized in the fields of psychology, sexology, and endo-crinology. If science has reached the hegemonic place that it occupies as a discourse and as a practice in our culture, it is because, as Ian Hacking, Steve Woolgar, and Bruno Latour have noticed, it works as a material-discoursive appara-tus of bodily production. 24 Technoscience has established its material authority by transforming the concepts of the psyche, libido, consciousness, femininity and masculin-ity, heterosexuality and homosexuality, intersexuality and transsexuality into tangible realities. They are manifest in commercial chemical substances and molecules, biotype bodies, and fungible technological goods managed by mul-tinationals. The success of contemporary technoscientific industry consists in transforming our depression into Prozac, our masculinity into testosterone, our erection into Viagra, our fertility/sterility into the Pill, our AIDS into tritherapy, without knowing which comes first: our 24.

This performative feedback is one of the mechanisms of the pharmacopornographic regime. Contemporary society is inhabited by toxic-porno- graphic subjectivities: subjectivities defined by the sub-stance (or substances) that supply their metabolism, by the cybernetic prostheses and various types of pharma-copornographic desires that feed the subject's actions and through which they turn into agents. So we will speak of Prozac subjects, cannabis subjects, cocaine subjects, alcohol subjects, Ritalin subjects, cortisone subjects, silicone sub-jects, heterovaginal subjects, double-penetration subjects, Viagra subjects, $ subjects . . . There is nothing to discover in nature; there is no hidden secret. We live in a punk hypermodernity: it is no longer about discovering the hidden truth in nature; it is about the necessity to specify the cultural, political, and technologi-cal processes through which the body as artifact acquires natural status. The oncomouse, 25 the laboratory mouse bio - technologically designed to carry a carcinogenic gene, eats Heidegger. Buffy kills the vampire of Simone de Beauvoir. The dildo, a synthetic extension of sex to produce pleasure and identity, eats Rocco Siffredi's cock. There is nothing to discover in sex or in sexual identity; there is no inside. The truth about sex is not a disclosure; it is sexdesign. Phar - macopornographic biocapitalism does not produce things. 25. See Donna J.

Some of the most influential analyses of the current transformations of industrial society and capitalism relevant to my own work are the following: Maurizio Lazzarato, \"Le concept \"biopolitical work\" the forms of produc - tion that are linked to aids provided to the body, to care, to the protection of the other and to the creation of human relations, to the \"feminine\" work of reproduction, 29 to rela- tionships of communication and exchange of knowledge and affects. But most often, analysis and description of this new form of production stops biopolitically at the belt. 30 What if, in reality, the insatiable bodies of the multi- tude\u2014their cocks, clitorises, anuses, hormones, and neu-rosexual synapses\u2014what if desire, excitement, sexuality, seduction, and the pleasure of the multitude were all the mainsprings of the creation of value added to the contem-porary economy? And what if cooperation were a masturba-tory cooperation and not the simple cooperation of brains? The pornographic industry is currently the great main- spring of our cybereconomy; there are more than a mil-lion and a half sites available to adults at any point on the planet. Sixteen billion dollars is generated annually by the sex industry, a large part of it belonging to the porn por - tals of the Internet. Each day, 350 new portals allow virtual access to an exponentially increasing number of users. If 28. Antonio Negri and Hardt, 135. 29. Ibid., 137.

Several trajectories in this direction come from the reflections in Precarias a la Deriva, by Anne Querrien and Antonella Corsani. See Precarias a la Deriva, (Post-)Marxism,\" trans. Timothy S. Murphy, SubStance #112: Italian Post-Workerist Thought 36, no. 1, (2007): 106-38; and Linda McDowell, \"Life without Father and Ford: The New Gender Order of Post-Fordism,\" Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers 16, no. 4 (1991): 400-19.The Pharmacopornographic er a 37it's true that the majority of these sites belong to amateur portals are what constitute the truly emerging market for Internet porn. When Jennifer Kaye Ringley had the initiative in 1996 to install several webcams through-out her home that broadcast real-time videos of her daily life through her Internet portal, the model of the single transmitter was supplanted. In documentary style, Jen-niCams produce an audiovisual chronicle of sex lives and are paid for by subscription, similar to the way some TV stations operate. Today, any user of the Internet who has a body, a computer, a video camera, or a webcam, as well as an Internet connection and a bank account, can create a porn site and have access to the cybermarket of the sex indus - try. The autopornographic body has suddenly emerged as a new force in the world economy. The recent access of rela-tively impoverished populations all over the planet to the technical means of producing cyberpornography has, for the first time, sabotaged a monopoly that was until now controlled by the big multinationals of porn. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the first people able to make use of this market were sex workers from the former Soviet bloc, then those in China, Africa, and India. Confronted with such autonomous strategies on the part of sex workers, the mul-tinationals of porn have gradually united with advertising companies, hoping to attract cybervisitors by offering free access to their pages. The sex industry is not only the most profitable mar - ket on the Internet; it's also the model of maximum profit - ability for the global cybernetic market (comparable only 38 Th e Pharmacopornographic er ato financial speculation): minimum investment, direct sales of the product in real time in a unique fashion, the production of instant satisfaction for the consumer. Every Internet portal is modeled on and organized according to this masturbatory logic of pornographic consumption. If the financial analysts who direct Google, eBay, or Facebook are attentively following the fluctuations of the cyberporn market, it's because the sex industry furnishes an economic model of the cybernetic market as a whole. If we consider that the pharmaceutical industry (which includes the legal extension of the scientific, medical, and cosmetic industries, as well as the trafficking of drugs declared illegal), the pornography industry, and the indus - try of war are the load-bearing sectors of post-Fordist capitalism, we ought to be able to give a cruder name to immaterial labor. Let us dare, then, to make the following hypothesis: the raw materials of today's production pro-cess are excitation, erection, ejaculation, and pleasure and feelings of self-satisfaction, omnipotent control, and total destruction. The real stake of capitalism today is the phar - macopornographic control of subjectivity, whose products are serotonin, and one, antibiotics, estra-diol, techno-milk, alcohol and tobacco, morphine, insulin, cocaine, living human eggs, citrate of sildenafil (Viagra), and the entire material and virtual complex participating in the production of mental and psychosomatic states of exci-tation, relaxation, and discharge, as well as those of omni - p otence and total control. In these conditions, money itself becomes an abstract, signifying psychotropic substance. The Pharmacopornographic er a 39Sex is the corollary of capitalism and war, the mirror of production. The dependent and sexual body and sex and all its semiotechnical derivations are henceforth the principal resource of post-Fordist capitalism. Although the era dominated by the economy of the automobile has been named \"Fordism,\" let us call this new economy pharmacopornism , dominated as it is by the indus - try of the pill, the masturbatory logic of pornography, and the chain of excitation-frustration on which it is based. The pharmacopornographic industry is white and viscous gold, the crystalline powder of biopolitical capitalism. Negri and Hardt, in rereading Marx, have shown that \"in the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the global economy is characterized by the hegemony of industrial labor, even if, in quantitative terms, the latter remains minor in comparison to other forms of production such as agriculture.\" 31 Industrial labor was hegemonic by virtue of the powers of transformation it exerted over any other form of production. Pharmacopornographic production is characteristic today of a new age of political world economy, not by its quantitative supremacy, but because the control, produc - tion, and intensification of narcosexual affects have become the model of all other forms of production. In this way, pharmacopornographic control infiltrates and dominates the entire flow of capital, from agrarian biotechnology to high-tech industries of communication. In this period of the body's technomanagement, the 31. Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt, Multitude (Paris: Editions 10-18, DL, 2006), 133-34.40 Th e Pharmacopornographic er apharmacopornographic industry synthesizes and defines a specific mode of production and consumption, a masturba-tory temporization of life, a virtual and hallucinogenic aes-thetic of the living object, an architecture that transforms inner space into exteriority and the city into interiority and \"junkspace\" 32 by means of mechanisms of immediate auto- surveillance and ultrarapid diffusion of information, a con-tinuous mode of desiring and resisting, of consuming and destroying, of evolution and self-destruction. Potentia Gaudendi To understand how and why sexuality and the body, the excitable body, at the end of the nineteenth century raided the heart of political action and became the objects of a minute governmental and industrial management, we must first elaborate a new philosophical concept in the pharmacopornographic domain that is equivalent to the force of work in the domain of classical economics. I call potentia gaudendi , or \"orgasmic force,\" the (real or virtual) strength of a body's (total) excitation. 33 This strength is of indeterminate capacity; it has no gender; it is neither male nor female, neither human nor animal, neither animated nor inanimate. Its orientation emphasizes neither the fem- 32. For an elaboration of this idea, see Rem Koolhaas, \"Junkspace,\" October 100 (Spring, 2002): 175-90. 33. My work here begins with the notion of \"power of action or force of existing\" elaborated by Spinoza and derived from the Greek idea of dynamis and its correlations in scholastic metaphysics; Vincennes \u00e0 Denis, Universit\u00e9 Paris 8, Paris, February 2, 1980).The Pharmacopornographic er a 41inine nor the masculine and creates no boundary between heterosexuality and homosexuality or between object and subject; neither does it know the difference between being excited, being exciting, or being-excited-with. It favors no organ over any other, so that the penis possesses no more orgasmic force than the vagina, the eye, or the toe. Orgasmic force is the sum of the potential for excitation inherent in every material molecule. Orgasmic force is not seeking any immediate resolution, and it aspires only to its own extension in space and time, toward everything and everyone, in every place and at every moment. It is a force of transformation for the world in pleasure\u2014\"in pleasure with.\" Potentia gaudendi unites all material, somatic, and psychic forces and seeks all biochemical resources and all the structures of the mind. In pharmacopornographic capitalism, the force of work reveals its actual substratum: orgasmic force, or potentia gaudendi . Current capitalism tries to put to work the poten - tia gaudendi in whatever form in which it exists, whether this be in its pharmacological form (a consumable molecule and material agency that will operate within the body of the person who is digesting it), as a pornographic repre-sentation (a semiotechnical sign that can be converted into numeric data or transferred into digital, televisual, or telephonic media), or as a sexual service (a live pharmaco-pornographic entity whose orgasmic force and emotional volume are put in service to a consumer during a specified time, according to a more or less formal contract of sale of sexual services).42 Th e Pharmacopornographic er aPotentia gaudendi is characterized not only by its imper - manence and great malleability, but also and above all by the impossibility of possessing and retaining it. Potentia gaudendi , as the fundamental energetics of pharmacoporn- ism, does not allow itself to be reified or transformed into private property. I can neither possess nor retain another's potentia gaudendi , but neither can one possess or retain what seems to be one's own. Potentia gaudendi exists exclu- sively as an event, a relation, a practice, or an evolutionary process. Orgasmic force is both the most abstract and the most material of all workforces. It is inextricably carnal and digital, viscous yet representational by numerical values, a phantasmatic or molecular wonder that can be transformed into capital. The living pansexual body is the bioport of the orgasmic force. Thus, it cannot be reduced to a prediscursive organ-ism; its limits do not coincide with the skin capsule that surrounds it. This life cannot be understood as a biologi-cal given; it does not exist outside the interlacing of pro-duction and culture that belongs to technoscience. This body is a technoliving, multiconnected entity incorporat - ing technology. 34 Neither an organism nor a machine, but \"the fluid, dispersed, networking techno-organic-textual-mythic system.\" 35 This new condition of the body blurs the traditional modern distinction between art, performance, 34.

The new pharmacological and surgical techniques set in motion tectonic construction processes that combine figurative representations derived from cinema and from architecture (editing, 3-D modeling, 3-D printing, etc.), according to which the organs, the ves - sels, the fluids (techno-blood, techno-sperm, etc.), and the molecules are converted into the prime material from which our pharmacopornographic corporality is manufactured. Technobodies are either not-yet-alive or already-dead: we are half fetuses, half zombies. Thus, every politics of resis - tance is a monster politics. Marshall McLuhan, Buckminster Fuller, and Norbert Wiener had an intuition about it in the 1950s: the technologies of communication function like an extension of the body. Today, the situation seems a lot more complex\u2014the individual body functions like an extension of global technologies of communication. \"Embodiment is significant prosthesis.\" 36 To borrow the terms of the Ameri- can feminist Donna J. Haraway, the twenty-first-century body is a technoliving system, the result of an - ible implosion of modern binaries (female/male, animal/human, nature/culture). Even the term life has become archaic for identifying the actors in this new technology. For Foucault's notion of \"biopower,\" Donna J. Haraway has substituted \"techno-biopower.\" It's no longer a question of power over life, of the power to manage and maximize life, as Foucault wanted, but of power and control exerted over a technoliving and connected whole. 37 36. Ibid., 195. 37. Ibid., 204-30.44 Th e Pharmacopornographic er aIn the circuit in which excitation is technoproduced, there are neither living bodies nor dead bodies, but present or missing, actual or virtual connectors. Images, viruses, computer programs, techno-organic fluids, Net surfers, electronic voices that answer phone sex lines, drugs and living dead animals in the laboratory on which they are tested, frozen embryos, mother cells, active alkaloid mol-ecules . . . display no value in the current global economy as being \"alive\" or \"dead,\" but only to the extent that they can or can't be integrated into a bioelectronics of global excitation. Haraway reminds us that \"cyborg figures\u2014such as the end-of-the-millennium seed, chip gene, database, bomb, fetus, race, brain, and ecosystem\u2014are the offspring of implosions of subjects and objects and of the natural and artificial.\" 38 Every technobody, including a dead techno- body, can unleash orgasmic force, thus becoming a carrier of the power of production of sexual capital. The force that lets itself be converted into capital lies neither in bios nor in soma , in the way that they have been conceived from Aristo- tle to Darwin, but in techno-eros, the technoliving enchanted body and its potentia gaudendi . And from this it follows that biopolitics (the politics of the control and production of life) as well as necropolitics (the politics of the control and production of death) function as pharmaco porno politics, as planetary managements of potentia gaudendi . Sex, the so-called sexual organs, pleasure and impo- tence, joy and horror are moved to the center of technopo-litical management as soon as the possibility of drawing 38. Haraway, Modest_Witness , 12.The Pharmacopornographic er a 45profit from orgasmic force comes into play. If the theorists of post-Fordism were interested in immaterial work, in cognitive work, in \"non-objectifiable work,\" 39 in \"affective work,\"40 we theorists of pharmacopornographic capitalism are interested in sexual work as a process of subjectiviza-tion, in the possibility of making the subject an inexhaust - ible supply of planetary ejaculation that can be transformed into abstraction and digital data\u2014into capital. This theory of \"orgasmic force\" should not be read through a Hegelian paranoid or Rousseauist utopian/dys - topian prism; the market isn't an outside power coming to expropriate, repress, or control the sexual instincts of the individual. On the other hand, we are being confronted by the most depraved of political situations: the body isn't aware of its potentia gaudendi as long as it does not put it to work. Orgasmic force in its role as the workforce finds itself progressively regulated by a strict technobiopolitical con-trol. The sexual body is the product of a sexual division of flesh according to which each organ is defined by its func - tion. A sexuality always implies a precise governing of the mouth, hand, anus, vagina. Until recently, the relation-ship between buying/selling and dependence that united the capitalist to the worker also governed the relationship between the genders, which was conceived as a relation-ship between the ejaculator and the facilitator of ejacula-tion. Femininity, far from being nature, is the quality of the 39. Paolo Virno, \"La multitude comme subjectivite,\" in Grammaire de 134.46 Th e Pharmacopornographic er aorgasmic force when it can be converted into merchandise, into an object of economic exchange, into work. Obviously, a male body can occupy (and in fact already does occupy) a position of female gender in the market of sex work and, as a result, see its orgasmic power reduced to a capacity for work. The control of orgasmic power (puissance ) not only defines the difference between genders, the female/male dichotomy, it also governs, in a more general way, the technobiopolitical difference between heterosexuality and homosexuality. The technical restriction of masturbation and the invention of homosexuality as a pathology are of a pair with the composition of a disciplinary regime at the heart of which the collective orgasmic force is put to work as a function of the heterosexual reproduction of the spe-cies. Heterosexuality must be understood as a politically assisted procreation technology. But after the 1940s, the moleculized sexual body was introduced into the machin-ery of capital and forced to mutate its forms of production. Biopolitical conditions change drastically when it becomes possible to derive benefits from masturbation through the mechanism of pornography and the employment of tech-niques for the control of sexual reproduction by means of contraceptives and artificial insemination. If we agree with Marx that \"workforce is not actual work carried out but the simple potential or ability for work,\" then it must be said that every human or animal, real or virtual, female or male body possesses this mastur - batory potentiality, a potentia gaudendi , the power to pro- duce molecular joy, and therefore also possesses productive The Pharmacopornographic er a 47power without being consumed and depleted in the pro- cess. Until now, we've been aware of the direct relation-ship between the pornification of the body and the level of oppression. Throughout history, the most pornified bodies have been those of non-human animals, women and chil-dren, the racialized bodies of the slave, the bodies of young workers and the homosexual body. But there is no ontologi-cal relationship between anatomy and potentia gaudendi . The credit goes to the French writer Michel Houellebecq for having understood how to build a dystopian fable about this new capacity of global capitalism, which has manufac - tured the megaslut and the megaletch. The new hegemonic subject is a body (often codified as male, white, and het - erosexual) supplemented pharmacopornographically (by Viagra, coke, pornography) and a consumer of pauperized sexual services (often in bodies codified as female, childlike, or racialized): \"When he can, a westerner works ; he often finds his work frustrating or boring, but he pretends to find it inter - esting: this much is obvious. At the age of fifty, weary of teaching, of math, of everything, I decided to see the world. I had just been divorced for the third time; as far as sex was concerned, I wasn't expecting much. My first trip was to Thailand, and immediately after that I left for Madagascar. I haven't fucked a white woman since. I've never even felt the desire to do so. Believe me,\" he added, placing a firm hand on Lionel's forearm, \"you won't find a white woman with a soft, submissive, supple, muscular pussy anymore. That's all gone now.\" 41 41. Michel Houellebecq, Platform, trans. Frank Wynne (New York: Random House, 2002), 80.48 Th e Pharmacopornographic er aPower is located not only in the (\"female,\" \"childlike,\" or \"nonwhite\") body as a space traditionally imagined as pre-discursive and natural, but also in the collection of repre-sentations that render it sexual and desirable. In every case it remains a body that is always pharmacopornographic, a technoliving system that is the effect of a widespread cul-tural mechanism of representation and production. The goal of contemporary critical theory would be to unravel our condition as pharmacopornographic work - ers/consumers. If the current theory of the feminization of labor omits the cum shot, conceals videographic ejacula-tion behind the screen of cooperative communication, it's because, unlike Houellebecq, the philosophers of biopoli-tics prefer not to reveal their position as customers of the global pharmacopornomarket. In the first volume of Homo Sacer , Giorgio Agamben reclaims Walter Benjamin's concept of the \"naked life\" in order to define the biopolitical status of the subject after Auschwitz, a subject whose paradigm would be the con-centration camp prisoner or the illegal immigrant held in a temporary detention center, reduced to existing only physi-cally and stripped of all legal status or citizenship. To such a notion of the \"naked life,\" we could add that of the phar - macopornographic life, or naked technolife; the distinctive feature of a body stripped of all legal or political status is that its use is intended as a source of production of poten - tia gaudendi . The distinctive feature of a body reduced to naked technolife, in both democratic societies and fascist regimes, is precisely the power to be the object of maxi-mum pharmacopornographic exploitation. Identical codes The Pharmacopornographic er a 49of pornographic representation function in the images of the prisoners of Abu Ghraib,42 the eroticized images of Thai adolescents, advertisements for L'Or\u00e9al and McDon-ald's, and the pages of Hot magazine. All these bodies are already functioning, in an inexhaustible manner, as carnal and digital sources of ejaculatory capital. For the Aristote-lian distinction between z and bios , between animal life deprived of any intentionality and \"exalted\" life, that is, life gifted with meaning and self-determination that is a sub-strate of biopolitical government, we must today substitute the distinction between raw and biotech (biotechnocultur - ally produced); and the latter term refers to the condition of life in the pharmacopornographic era. Biotechnologi-cal reality deprived of all civic context (the body of the migrant, the deported, the colonized, the porn actress/actor, the sex worker, the laboratory animal, etc.) becomes that of the corpus (and no longer that of homo) pornographi - cus whose life (a technical condition rather than a purely biological one), lacking any right to citizenship, author - ship, and right to work, is composed by and subject to self-surveillance and global mediatization. No need to resort to the dystopian model of the concentration or extermination camp\u2014which are easy to denounce as mechanisms of con-trol\u2014in order to discover naked technolife, because it's at the center of postindustrial democracies, forming part of a global, integrated multimedia laboratory-brothel, where the control of the flow of affect begins under the pop form of excitation-frustration. 42.

There's no porn with-out the Pill or without Viagra. Inversely, there is no Viagra or Pill without porn. The new kind of sexual production implies a detailed and strict control of the forces of repro-duction of the species. There is no pornography without a parallel surveillance and control of the body's affects and fluids. Acting on this pharmacoporno body are the forces of the reproduction industry, entailing control of the pro-duction of eggs, techniques of programming relationships, straw collections of sperm, in vitro fertilization, artificial insemination, the monitoring of pregnancy, the technical planning of childbirth, and so on. Consequently, the sexual division of traditional work gradually disintegrates. Phar - macopornographic capitalism is ushering in a new era in which the most interesting kind of commerce is the pro-duction of the species as species, the production of its mind and its body, its desires and its affects. Contemporary biocapitalism at the same time produces and destroys the species. Although we're accustomed to speaking of a soci-ety of consumption, the objects of consumption are only the scintilla of a psychotoxic virtual production. We are consumers of air, dreams, identity, relation, things of the mind. This pharmacopornographic capitalism functions in reality thanks to the biomediatic management of subjectiv - ity, through molecular control and the production of virtual audiovisual connections.The Pharmacopornographic er a 51The pharmaceutical and audiovisual digital industry are the two pillars on which contemporary biocapitalism relies; they are the two tentacles of a gigantic, viscous built-in circuit. The pharmacoporno program of the second half of the twentieth century is this: control the sexuality of those bodies codified as woman and cause the ejaculation of those bodies codified as men. The Pill, Prozac, and Viagra are to the pharmaceutical industry what pornography, with its grammar of blowjobs, penetrations, and cum shots, is to the industry of culture: the jackpot of postindustrial biocapitalism. Within the context of biocapitalism, an illness is the con- clusion of a medical and pharmaceutical model, the result of a technical and institutional medium that is capable of explaining it discursively, of realizing it and of treating it in a manner that is more or less operational. From a pharma-copornopolitical point of view, a third of the African popu-lation infected with HIV isn't really sick. The thousands of seropositive people who die each day on the continent of Africa are precarious bodies whose survival has not yet been capitalized as bioconsumers/producers by the Western pharmaceutical industry. For the pharmacopornographic system, these bodies are neither dead nor living. They are in a prepharmacopornographic state or their life isn't likely to produce an ejaculatory benefit, which amounts to the same thing. They are bodies excluded from the technobio-political regime. The emerging pharmaceutical industries of India, Brazil, or Thailand are fiercely fighting for the right to distribute their antiretrovirus therapies. Similarly, if we are still waiting for the commercialization of a vaccine for 52 Th e Pharmacopornographic er amalaria (a disease that was causing five million deaths a year on the continent of Africa), it is partly because the coun-tries that need it can't pay for it. The same Western multi-national companies that are launching costly programs for the production of Viagra or new treatments for prostate cancer would never invest in malaria. If we do not take into account calculations about pharmacopornographic profit - ability, it becomes obvious that erectile dysfunction and prostate cancer are not at all priorities in countries where life expectancies for human bodies stricken by tuberculosis, malaria, and AIDS don't exceed the age of fifty-five. 43 In the context of pharmacopornographic capitalism, sexual desire and illness are produced and cultivated on the same basis: without the technical, pharmaceutical, and mediatic supports capable of materializing them, they don't exist. We are living in a toxopornographic era. The postmodern body is becoming collectively desirable through its pharma-cological management and audiovisual advancement: two sectors in which the United States holds\u2014for the moment but, perhaps not for long\u2014worldwide hegemony. These two forces for the creation of capital are dependent not on an economy of production, but on an economy of invention . As Philippe Pignare has pointed out, \"The pharmaceutical industry is one of the economic sectors where the cost of research and development is very high, whereas the manu-facturing costs are extremely low. Unlike in the automobile industry, nothing is easier than reproducing a drug and 43. Michael Kremer and Christopher M. Snyder, \"Why Is There No AIDS Vaccine?\" (Research Paper, Washington, DC: The Brookings Institution, June 2006).The Pharmacopornographic er a 53guaranteeing its chemical synthesis on a massive scale, but nothing is more difficult or more costly than inventing it.\"44 In the same way, nothing costs less, materially speaking, than filming a blowjob or vaginal or anal penetration with a video camera. Drugs, like orgasms and books, are relatively easy and inexpensive to fabricate. The difficulty resides in their conception and political dissemination. 45 Pharma - copornographic biocapitalism does not produce things. It produces movable ideas, living organs, symbols, desires, chemical reactions, and affects. In the fields of biotechnol-ogy and pornocommunication, there are no objects to pro-duce; it's a matter of inventing a subject and producing it on a global scale. 44.

I keep them in a glass box for a long time, as if they were dissected scarabs, poi-son bullets extracted from a corpse, fetuses of an unknown species, vampire teeth capable of flying at your throat just for your having looked at them. During this period, I spend my time with my trans friends. Some are taking hormones as part of a protocol to change sex, and others are fooling with it, self-medicating without trying to change their gen-der legally or going through any psychiatric follow-up. They don't identify with the term gender dysphorics and declare themselves \"gender pirates,\" or \"gender hackers.\" I belong to this latter group of testosterone users. We're copyleft 1 users who consider sex hormones free and open biocodes, whose use shouldn't be regulated by the state or comman-deered by pharmaceutical companies. When I decide to 3. testogel 1. A play on the word \"copyright.\"\u2014Trans.take my first dose of testosterone, I don't talk about it to anyone. As if it were a hard drug, I wait until I'm alone in my home to try it. I wait for nightfall. I take a packet out of the glass box, which I close immediately, to be sure that today, for my first time, I'll take one, and only one, dose. I've barely started, yet I'm already behaving as if I were an addict of an illegal substance. I hide, keep an eye on myself, censure myself, exercise restraint. The following evening, almost at the same time, I take a second fifty-milligram dose. On the third day, the third dose. During these days and nights, I'm writing the text that will go with Del's last book of photos. I don't speak to anyone, just write. As if writing were the only accurate witness of this process. All the others are going to betray me. I know they're going to judge me for having taken testosterone. Some, because I'm going to become a man among men, because I was doing well as a girl. Others, because I took testosterone outside the aegis of a medical protocol, without wanting to become a man, because I used testosterone like a hard drug, like any other, and gave bad press to testosterone at the very moment when the law is beginning to integrate transsexu-als into society, to guarantee reimbursement from the state health service for the drugs and operations. Writing is the place where my secret addiction resides, at the same time as the stage on which my addiction seals a pact with the multitude. On the fourth night, no sleep. I'm lucid, energetic, wide awake, like I was the first night I had sex with a girl, when I was a kid. At four in the morning, I'm still writing, without the slightest sign of fatigue. Sit - ting in front of the computer, I feel the muscles of my back 56 T estogelinnervated by a cybernetic cable that starts at the surface of the city and grows in length, passing through my skull to connect with the planets most distant from Earth. At six in the morning, after ten hours of not moving from my chair, of drinking only water, I get up and go out with my dog, Justine, for a walk in the city. It's the first time I leave my home at six in the morning without a precise destination, on an autumn day. The bulldog is puzzled; she doesn't like to go out so early, but she follows. I need to breathe the air of the city, to leave the space of domesticity, to walk outside where I feel at home. I walk down rue de Belleville to the Chinese market; the African garbage collectors are building dikes with old rugs to change the course of the sewage. I wait for the Les Folies bar to open, have a coffee, wolf down two croissants, and return up the street. When I get home, I'm sweating. I notice my sweat has changed. I collapse onto the couch and watch i-T\u00e9l\u00e9, the news only, and for the first time in three days I fall into a deep sleep drenched in that testosterone sweat, next to Justine. Testogel 57shOOT The testosterone I'm taking has the brand name Testogel. It was produced by Besins Laboratories in Montrouge, France. Here is the description of this drug from the package insert: testogel 50 mg is a transparent or slightly opalescent and colorless gel packaged in 5-gram sachets. It contains testosterone, a naturally secreted male hormone. This drug is recommended for illnesses related to a deficiency of testosterone. Before beginning a treatment with tes-togel , a deficiency in testosterone must be established by a series of clinical signs (decline of secondary sexual characteristics, changes in physical constitution, asthe-nia, a decrease in libido, erectile dysfunction, etc.). This drug has been prescribed to you for your own use and must not be given to others. Attention: testogel should not be used by women. 58 T estogelsaf ety i nstructions for u sers of testogel 50 mg, gel in sachets: Possible transference of testosterone. Failing to follow recommended safety instructions may cause the transfer of testosterone onto another individual during intimate and prolonged cutaneous contact with the area to which the gel has been applied. This transfer can be avoided by covering the area of application with clothing or by showering before all contact. The following safety instructions are advised:Wash hands with water and soap after applying the gel.Cover the area of application with clothing once the gel has dried. Shower before all intimate contact. fo r those individuals not being treated with testogel 50:In case of contact with an unwashed or uncovered area of application, immediately wash with soap and water skin that may have been subjected to a transfer of testosterone. Consult a physician if the following symptoms appear: acne, changes in pilosity. It is preferable to wait approximately six hours between application of the gel and showering or bathing. However, washing occasionally one to six hours after application of the gel should not significantly change the course of treatment. To guarantee the safety of one's female partner, the patient is advised to observe a prolonged interval of time between application of the gel and the period of contact, to wear a T-shirt over the site of application during the period of contact, or to shower before any sexual activity.Testogel 59I am reading the Testogel package insert, realizing that I'm holding a manual for microfascism, at the same time as I'm worrying about the possible immediate or side effects of the molecule on my body. The laboratory assumes that the testosterone user is a \"man\" who isn't producing enough androgen naturally and who, obviously, is heterosexual (the safety instructions concerning the cutaneous transfer of testosterone allude to a female partner). Does this notion of a man refer to the chromosomal (XY), genital (possess - ing a penis and well-differentiated testicles), or legal (the specification \"Sex: M\" appearing on one's ID card) defini-tion? If the administration of synthetic testosterone is prescribed for cases of testosterone deficiency, when and according to what criteria is it possible to affirm that a body is deficient? Does an examination of my clinical symp-toms indicate a lack of testosterone? Isn't it the case that my beard has never grown and that my clitoris does not exceed a centimeter and a half? What would the ideal size and degree of erectility of a clitoris be? And what about the political signs? How can we measure them? Be that as it may, in order to legally obtain a dose of synthetic testoster - one, it is necessary to stop defining yourself as a woman. Even before the effects of the testosterone are apparent in my body, the condition for the possibility of administering the molecule to me is having renounced my female iden-tity. An excellent political tautology. Like depressions or schizophrenia, masculinity and femininity are pharmaco-pornographic fictions retroactively defined in relationship to the molecule with which they are treated. The category depression does not exist without the synthetic molecule of 60 T estogelserotonin, the same way that clinical masculinity does not exist without synthetic testosterone. I decide to keep my legal identity as a woman and to take testosterone without subscribing to a sex change protocol. It's a bit like biting the dick that's raping you, the pharma-copornographic system's dick. Obviously, such a position is one of political arrogance. If I'm able to take such a liberty at this time, it's because I don't need to go out and look for work, because I'm white, because I have no intention of having a bureaucratic relationship to the state. My deci-sion does not enter into conflict with the position of all the transsexuals who've decided to sign a contract with the state for changing sex in order to have access both to the molecule and to legal identity as a male. 2 Actually, my ges - ture would lack strength were it not for the legions of silent transsexuals for whom the molecule, the protocol, and the change of legal identity are essential. All of us are united by the same carbon chains, by the same invisible gel; without them, none of this would have any meaning. This drug is reserved for the use of the adult male. Suggested dosage is 5 g of gel (equivalent to 50 mg of tes - tosterone) once a day, to be applied at the same time, pref - erably in the morning. The physician will adapt the doses according to the needs of the patient, without exceeding 2. On March 1, 2007, the Spanish government acknowledged the request of the transsexual lobbies to have access to a legal change of sex (a change of name on identification cards) without being obliged to undergo surgery. However, this law requires the hormonal and social transformation of the individual during a period of at least two years as a condition for legally changing sex (in reality, the terms changing name or changing gender would be more precise). The measure is currently being criticized by various transsexual and transgender movements in Spain.Testogel 6162 T estogel10 g of gel per day.

If you have accidentally exceeded the proper dose of testogel mg, consult your physician. The leaflet doesn't supply instructions for hormonal therapy for the changing of sex.

Athletes and women? Must one detect a hidden syllo- gism here according to which all athletes are men, or must one understand that women, even if they are athletic, always remain women more than athletes? This is one way of tracing a political boundary when it comes to testoster - one use. Actually, it's a warning to athletes and to women 64 T estogelthat testosterone can be considered to be an illegal stimu- lant. Outside the law. For women, whether they're athletic or not, taking testosterone is a form of doping. Keep this leaflet. You may need to reread it. The list of undesirable side effect may be long, but I'm placing a limit on cultural paranoia, and I put the leaflet in a file intended for the following: \"T. Research.\" I certainly will need to reread it. Testogel, says the medical leaflet, is not in any case to be given to an individual for whom it has not been prescribed (for example, the way Del has given it to me, as I've given it to King E., as King E. has given it to V . King, etc.), a condi-tion that is common to the majority of drugs: antibiotics, antivirals, corticoids, and so on. In the case of testosterone, controls over \"passage of the substance\" seem more com-plicated, not only because it is liable to be sold on the black market and consumed without a prescription, but especially because Testogel applied to one body can \"pass\" impercep-tibly onto another body through skin contact. Testosterone is one of the rare drugs that is spread by sweat, from skin to skin, body to body. How can such trafficking\u2014the microdiffusion of min- ute drops of sweat, the importing and exporting of vapors, such contraband exhalations\u2014be controlled, surveyed; how to prevent the contact of crystalline mists, how to con-trol the transparent demon's sliding from another's skin toward mine? Testogel 65rendez VOus wi Th T Paris, November 25, 2005. I'm waiting until ten in the eve- ning to take a new dose of Testogel. I've taken a shower so that I don't have to wash myself after applying it. I've set out a blue work shirt, a tie, and black trousers to take Justine out for a walk afterward. I haven't felt any change since yesterday. I'm waiting for the effects of T., without knowing exactly what they'll be or how or when they'll become apparent. I've spent the last two hours on Skype talking with Del; we've been choosing the photos that will be published in his new book, Sex Works. I prefer the ones taken in public places, like that series from the S&M scene at Scott's Bar in the early 1980s. Three bodies are getting it on in the bathrooms, which have paneled walls: two lesbi-ans with their clothes on are busy with a third, half-naked body. They're using a black leather switch to whip an ass that's been offered to them, someone leaning against a door with a plaid shirt rolled up around the neck and Levis 501 at the knees. In this series, the lens varies its point of view, getting nearer and farther from skin, objects, seek - ing out or evading glances, showing or hiding the affects that are produced. One of the photos disregards the main scene to focus on the geometric patterns of the tiles. Scott's Bar was a lesbian cathedral; the arrangement of its secret signs outlines the labyrinth of a Sapphic Chartres, shows the path of a pleasure that has never yet been experi-enced. Then the lens returns to the bodies. In the middle ground of the shot, a butch and a femme, who are nude, are rummaging through the shirts hanging in a makeshift wardrobe. Bill, the perfect embodiment of butch, is in the 66 T estogelforeground: short hair, a fifties rocker look, smooth face, a cigarette dangling slightly downward from the left side of the mouth, a small name tag around the neck (the graini-ness of the black-and-white photo makes it impossible to make out the details); a black leather jacket over a naked torso, nothing underneath except the hump of a stuffed white jockstrap and a studded black belt from which hangs a bunch of sparkling keys. To the left, a slender butch is leaning a shaved head against a fire extinguisher. We talk only about the photos, even though it was Del who gave me the packets of Testogel. I don't tell him that I'm hanging up in order to take my dose. I just tell him I have to hang up. He manages to keep me on a few minutes more by paying me compliments, and I'm late for my ten o'clock rendezvous with T. A minute later, there I am: I've opened the silver packet, and the cool, transparent gel has disappeared under the skin of my arms. All that's left is a cool whiff of mint that draws my shoulders up toward the sky. No drug is as pure as testosterone in gel form. It's odor - less. However, the day after I take it, my sweat becomes sickly sweet, more acidic. The smell of a plastic doll heated by the sun comes from me, apple liqueur abandoned at the bottom of a glass. It's my body that is reacting to the mol-ecule. Testosterone has no taste or color, leaves no traces. The testosterone molecule dissolves into the skin as a ghost walks through a wall. It enters without warning, penetrates without leaving a mark. You don't need to smoke, sniff, or inject it or even swallow it. It's enough to bring it near my skin, and its mere proximity to the body causes it to disap-pear into and become diluted in my blood.Testogel 6768The discontinuity of history, body, power: Foucault describes the transformation of European society in the late eighteenth century from what he calls a \"sovereign society\" into a \"disciplinary society,\" which he sees as a shift away from a form of power that determines and ritualizes death toward a new form of power that technically plans life based on population, health, and the national interest. Bio - pouvoir (biopower) is his way of referring to this new form of productive, diffuse, sprawling power. Spilling beyond the boundaries of the legal realm and punitive sphere, it becomes a force of \"somato-power\" that penetrates and composes the body of the modern individual. This power no longer plays the role of a coercive law through a nega-tive mandate but is more versatile and welcoming, taking on the form of \"an art of governing life,\" an overall political technology that is transformed into disciplinary architec - tures (prisons, barracks, schools, hospitals, etc.), scientific texts, statistical tables, demographic calculations, how-to manuals, usage guidelines, schedules for the regulation of reproduction, and public health projects. Foucault under - lined the centrality of sex and of sexuality in this modern art of government. The biopower processes of the feminine body's hysterization, children's sexual pedagogy, the regu-4. hIstor Y e C hnosexual I t Ylation of procreative conduct, and the psychiatrization of the pervert's pleasures will be to Foucault the axes of this project that he characterized with some degree of irony as a process of sexual modernization. 1 In keeping with the intuitions of Michel Foucault, Monique Wittig, and Judith Butler, I refer to one of the dominant forms of this biopolitical action, which emerged with disciplinary capitalism, as sexopolitics . 2 Sex, its truth, its visibility, and its forms of externalization; sexuality and the normal and pathological forms of pleasure; and race, in its purity or degeneracy, are three powerful somatic fictions that have obsessed the Western world since the eighteenth century, eventually defining the scope of all contempo-rary theoretical, scientific, and political activity. These are somatic fictions, not because they lack material reality but because their existence depends on what Judith Butler calls the performative repetition of processes of political construction. 3 Sex has become such a part of plans for power that the discourse on masculinity and femininity, as well as tech-niques of normalizing sexual identity, have turned into governmental agents of the control and standardization of life. Hetero- and homosexual identities were invented in 1868, inside a sphere of empiricism, taxonomic classifica-tion, and psychopathology. Likewise, Krafft-Ebing created an encyclopedia of normal and perverse sexualities where 1.

The fallopian tubes, Bartholin's gland, and the clitoris were defined as anatomical entities. One of the elemental political differences of the West (being a man or a woman) could be summed up by a banal equation: whether one had or did not have at birth a penis that was a cen-timeter and a half long. The first experiments in artificial insemination were accomplished on animals. With the help of mechanical instruments, interventions were made in the domain of the production of female pleasure; whereas, on the one hand, masturbation was controlled and prohib-ited, on the other, the female orgasm was medicalized and perceived as a crisis of hysteria. 5 Male orgasm was mecha - nized and domesticated through the lens of a budding por - nographic codification . . . Machinery was on the way. The body, whether docile or rabid, was ready. We could call the \"sexual empire\" (if we can be allowed to sexualize Hardt and Negri's rather chaste catchword) 6 that biopolitical regime that uses sex, sexuality, and sexual identity as the somato-political centers for producing and governing subjectivity.

The straight mind, to borrow an expression developed by Monique Wittig in the 1980s to designate heterosexuality\u2014 taken not as a sexual practice but as a political regime 7\u2014guarantees the structural relationship between the production of sexual identity and the production of certain body parts (to the detriment of others) as reproductive organs. One impor - tant task of this disciplinary work will consist of excluding the anus from circuits of production and pleasure. In the words of Deleuze and Guattari, \"The first organ to suffer privatization, removal from the social field, was the anus. It was the anus that offered itself as a model for privati-zation, at the same time that money came to express the flows' new state of abstraction.\" 8 The anus as a center of production of pleasure (and, in this sense, closely related to the mouth or hand, which are also organs strongly con-trolled by the sexopolitical campaign against masturbation and homosexuality in the nineteenth century) has no gen-der. Neither male nor female, it creates a short circuit in the division of the sexes. As a center of primordial passivity and a perfect locale for the abject, positioned close to waste and shit, it serves as the universal black hole into which rush genders, sexes, identities, and capital. The West has 7. Monique Wittig, La Pens\u00e9e with two orifices: a mouth that emits public signs and an impenetrable anus around which it winds a male, heterosexual subjectivity, which acquires the status of a socially privileged body. Until the seventeenth century, the sexual epistemol- ogy of the sovereign regime was dominated by what the historian Thomas Laqueur calls \"a system of similarities\"; female sexual anatomy was set up as a weak, internalized, degenerate variation of the only sex that possessed an ontological existence, the male. 9 The ovaries were consid- ered to be internal testicles and the vagina to be an inverted penis that served as a receptacle for male sex organs. Abor - tion and infanticide, practices of the time, weren't regu- 9.

Two hierarchically differentiated social and expressions divide the surface of a \"mono-sexual\" model: \"man,\" the perfect model of the human, and \"woman,\" a reproductive receptacle. In the sovereign regime, masculinity is the only somatic fiction with political power. Masculinity (embodied within the figures of the king and the father) is defined by necropolitical techniques: the king and the father are those who have the right of giving death. Sex assignment depended not only on the external morphology of the organs but, above all, on reproductive capacity and social role. A bearded woman who was capable of pregnancy, of putting a child into the world and nurs - ing it, was considered a woman, regardless of the shape and size of her vulva. Within such a somato-political configura-tion, sex and sexuality (note that the term sexuality itself wouldn't be invented until 1880) do not yet amount to cat - egories of knowledge or techniques of subjectivization that are likely to outdo the political segmentation that separates the slave from the free man, the citizen from the metic, or the lord from the serf. Differences between masculinity and femininity remain, as well as between several modes of the production of sexual pleasure, but these do not yet deter - mine the crystallizations of sexopolitical subjectivity. Beginning in the eighteenth century, a new, visual sexo- political regime that depends on a \"system of oppositions\" rather than on \"similarities\" takes form. It maps out a new sexual anatomy, in which the female sex ceases to be an history of Technosexuality 73inversion or interiorization of the male sex and becomes an entirely different sex whose forms and functions pro-ceed from their own anatomical logic. According to Thomas Laqueur, the invention of what could be called the aes - thetic of sexual (and racial) difference is needed to estab-lish an anatomical-political hierarchy between the sexes (male, female) and the races (white, nonwhite) in the face of upheavals resulting from movements of revolution and liberation that are clamoring for the enlargement of the boundaries of the public spheres for women and foreigners. It is here that anatomical truth functions like a legitimiza-tion of a new political organization of the social field. 10 The change that will give birth to the disciplinary regime begins with the political management of syphilis, the advent of sexual difference, the technical repression of masturbation, and the invention of sexual identities. 11 The culmination of these rigid and cumbersome technologies of the production of sexual identity will come in 1868 with the pathologizing of homosexuality and the bourgeois nor-malization of heterosexuality. From then on, abortion and postpartum infanticide will be subject to surveillance and punished by law. The body and its products will become the property of the male/husband/father and, by extension, the state and God. Inside this system of recognition, any corporal diver - gence from the norm (such as the size and form of the sex organs, facial pilosity, and the shape and size of the breasts) 10. Ibid., 149-92. 11. See Thomas Laqueur, Solitary Sex: A Cultural History of Masturbation (New York: Zone Books, 2003).74 h istory of Technosexualitywill be considered a monstrosity, a violation of the laws of nature or a perversion, a violation of moral law. As sexual difference is elevated to a category that is not only natu-ral but even transcendental (going beyond historical and cultural contexts), differences between homosexuality and heterosexuality appear as both anatomical and psychologi-cal, and so do the differences between sadism, masochism, and pedophilia; between normalcy and perversion. Con-sidered simple sexual practices until this moment, they become identities and conditions that must be studied, recorded, hounded, hunted, punished, cured. Each body, as Foucault tells us, becomes an \"individual to correct.\" 12 Invented as well are the child masturbator and the sexual monster. Under this new epistemological gaze, the bearded woman becomes either an object of scientific observation or a fairground attraction in the new urban agglomerate. This double shift toward medico-legal surveillance and mediatic spectacularization, intensified as it is by digital and data-processing techniques and communication net - works, will become one of the characteristics of the phar - macopornographic regime, whose expansion begins in the middle of the twentieth century. The sexopolitical devices that develop with the nine- teenth-century aesthetics of sexual difference and sexual identities are mechanical, semiotic, and architectonic techniques to naturalize sex. And here we can list a loose collection of the resulting phenomena: the atlas of sexual anatomy, treatises on optimizing natural resources com- 12.

These devices for the production of sexual subjectivity take the form of a political architecture external to the body. Their systems have a firm command of orthopedic politics and disciplinary exoskeletons. The model for these techniques of subjectivization, according to Foucault, could be Jeremy Bentham's architecture for the prison-factory (panopti-cism, in particular), the asylum, or the military barracks. If we think about devices of sexo-political subjectivization, then we must also speak about the expansion of a network of \"domestic architecture.\" These extensive, intensive, and, moreover, intimate architectural forms include a redefini-tion of private and public spaces, the management of sexual commerce, but also gynecological devices and sexual ortho-pedic inventions (the corset, the speculum, the medical vibrator), as well as new media techniques of control and representation (photography, film, incipient pornography) and the massive development of psychological techniques for introspection and confession. If it is true that Foucault's analysis up to this point, although not always chronologically exact, seems to have great critical acuity, it is no less true that his analysis loses intensity the closer it gets to contemporary society. Fou-cault neglected the emergence of a group of profound trans -76 h istory of Technosexualityformations of technologies of production of the body and subjectivity that progressively appeared beginning with World War II. They force us to conceptualize a third regime of subjectivization, a third system of knowledge-power that is neither sovereign nor disciplinary, neither premod-ern nor modern. In the postscript to A Thousand Plateaus, Deleuze and Guattari, inspired by William S. Burroughs, use the term \"control society\" 13 to name this \"new mon- ster\" of social organization that is a by-product of biopoliti-cal control. Adding notions inspired by both Burroughs and Bukowski, I shall call this the \"pharmacopornographic soci-ety.\" A politically programmed ejaculation is the currency of this new molecular-informatic control. After World War II, the somato-political context of the body's technopolitical production seems dominated by a series of new technologies of the body (biotechnology, sur - gery, endocrinology, genetic engineering, etc.) and repre-sentation (photography, cinema, television, internet, video games, etc.) that infiltrate and penetrate daily life like never before. These are biomolecular, digital, and broadband data-transmission technologies. This is the age of soft, featherweight, viscous, gelatinous technologies that can be injected, inhaled\u2014\"incorporated.\" The testosterone that I use is a part of these new gelatinous technologies. These three regimes of production of sexual bodies and subjectivities should not be understood as mere historical periods. The disciplinary regime didn't erase the sovereign necropolitical techniques. Likewise, the pharmacoporno- 13. totally obliterated biopolitical dis - ciplinary techniques. Three different and conflicting power regime techniques juxtapose and act upon the body pro-ducing our contemporary subject and somatic fiction. In disciplinary society, technologies of subjectiviza- tion controlled the body externally like orthoarchitectural apparatuses, but in the pharmacopornographic society, the technologies become part of the body: they dissolve into it, becoming somatechnics . 14 As a result, the body-power rela- tionship becomes tautological: technopolitics takes on the form of the body and is incorporated. One of the first signs of the transformation of the somato-power regime in the mid-twentieth century was the electrification, digitaliza-tion, and molecularization of these devices for the control and production of sexual difference and sexual identi-ties. Little by little, orthopedic-sexual and architectural disciplinary mechanisms were absorbed by lightweight, rapid-transmission microcomputing, as well as by pharma-cological and audiovisual techniques. If architecture and orthopedics in the disciplinary society served as models for understanding the relation of body to power, in the phar - macopornographic society, the models for body control are microprosthetic: now, power acts through molecules that incorporate themselves into our immune system; silicone takes the shape of our breasts; neurotransmitters alter our perceptions and behavior; hormones produce their systemic 14. In the early 2000s, a group of academics at Macquarie University, including Susan Stryker, coined the term \"somatechnics\" to highlight the complex relationship between body and technology. Technology does not add upon a given body, but rather it is the very means by which corporeality is crafted.78 h istory of Technosexualityeffects on hunger, sleep, sexual arousal, aggressiveness, and the social decoding of our femininity and masculinity. We are gradually witnessing the miniaturization, inter - nalization, and reflexive introversion (an inward coiling toward what is considered intimate, private space) of the surveillance and control mechanisms of the disciplinary sexopolitical regime. These new soft technologies of micro-control adopt the form of the body they control and become part of it until they are inseparable and indistinguishable from it, ending up as techno-soma-subjectivities. The body no longer inhabits disciplinary spaces but is inhabited by them. The biomolecular and organic structure of the body is the last hiding place of these biopolitical systems of con-trol.

The first time, it was for the release of Baise-Moi; the second, five years later, five days before your death, was September 27, 2005, at the Lydia Lunch concert at Divan du Monde, in Paris. And it was my body, a biopower prosthesis, a micro-excitable platform of resistance that fell in love. This is how it happened. Spring 2000. Under pressure from an organization of the extreme Right, the Council of State of the Socialist gov - ernment decides to revoke the distribution permit allow - ing the showing of the film Baise-Moi in theaters. Terrified by their own addiction to pornography and by the poten-tial visibility of their flaccid cocks, a federation of censors attacks the film as a way of saying \"no to pornography.\" They prevent its distribution, prohibit it in all movie the-aters, and confine it to distribution in DVD. In reality, they are saying no to the only feminism that could save us, a kind of feminism that has the potential to turn pharmacopornographic hegemony upside down. I go to a Parisian movie theater, the MK2 Od\u00e9on, where a small support group created by Catherine Breillat is expecting women directors. At the time, I've been working with vari-ous different queer groups that include lesbian rebels, fags 5.

This is the beginning of queer politics in Europe, and like everything, when it begins, people come with a joyful, innocent vitality. For months I devote all my time to organizing what I think is an impend-ing pansexual revolution: the crumbling of sexual identity into a multiplicity of desires, practices, and aesthetics, the invention of new molecular sensibilities, new forms of col-lective living . . . All of it seems possible, real, and inevitable at the time. Several of us queer activists meet at my place on rue Jean-Pierre Timbaud to put together two hundred photocopies of a leaflet; there's no money to create any more. The idea is to funnel the pornopolitical forces of the film into the queer faction, not because the two protago-nists in Baise-Moi are lesbian or anything as banal as that, but because they destroy everything in their path, because they're Franco-Arab girls who finish off a crowd of white men at the same time that they get down with all the good-looking boys they encounter. Certainly, the fact that both are superhot is an asset to the queer cause. I feel a bit ridiculous when I see VD for the first time, right outside the movie theater. My hands are full of pho-tocopies to the extent that I can't even offer her one as I greet her. I'm impressed by her Nordic peasant arms, her decidedly warriorlike walk. V is stoned on alcohol, coke, speed, I suppose. Coralie, too, but I see them as very confi-dent about what they're doing, capable of shutting up any ideologue at all from the extreme Right. They're two dogs without a master, barking at the pack of liberals who are In Which the bo dy of VD be comes an el ement in an ex perimental co ntext 83denouncing the sexual violence of the protagonists in the film. When I tell them that Nadine and Manu are heroines for a potential queer revolution, they look at me expres - sionlessly. Nobody knows what the word queer means at this point in France. Mainlining gender, class, and race terrorism\u2014now, that kind of thing speaks to them. See-ing her among these people, some of whom I know and others whom I don't, immediately gives me the desire to get it on with her. Wanting to get done by VD must be a widespread sentiment. I'm attracted to her, beyond any concrete reference to the fact that she is, apparently, het - erosexual. Or maybe that's the reason, and for the pleasure of knowing that someday she'll stop being it to become the queen of the dykes and the boy-girls. I figure it has some-thing to do with the title of her book and the actresses in the film, with their way of fucking everything that passes by. The feeling doesn't impress me and even makes me feel a bit ashamed because there's something in it that's an unconscious response to an advertising gimmick, as if the performative power of the words B-a-i-s-e-M-o-i (F-u-c-k-M-e) 1 had appealed immediately to my synthetic urge to fuck her. However, I don't understand exactly why it's she who attracts me. And not Coralie, with her beauty reminis-cent of the half-Nazi great lady of an Asian brothel; or Raf - fa\u00eblla, as hot-tempered and jumpy as a lesbian pit bull; or Karen, who lets the crowd fawn on her the way a queen of the sand slowly cleaves the waves of a choppy sea.

They're harem, her Amazons, her hot, irascible she-wolves, her lady's companions with looks that kill, her tattooed bodyguards, revolutionary sluts, but she's the one I want. What astonishes me is the certainty with which her presence strikes me. But I do nothing to get to her, I'm too busy with queer politics. I've just published the Manifesto in your series, and, despite its editorial peculiar - ity, it does well enough. I'm invited to every part of France, especially by gay and lesbian organizations, and I travel to more than twenty cities where presidents of gay or trans associations with Club Med names\u2014like Women Together, Women on Track, Trans-formation, Rose-Colored Glasses, Sappho's Way, the Violets\u2014welcome me . . .

But I learn to think in public, to love crowds, to receive their vast impersonal love. At the time, this is how I become involved with organizing drag king workshops; lectures on American feminism and queer theory; reading workshops about But - ler, Foucault, and Derrida; seminars on the history of sexu-ality in the electronic age. I'm too involved for a sex life. The problem is that when I meet her again, five years have passed. During this time, I've become distanced from queer politics and she has put a lot into a heterosexual company that's going bankrupt and in which she ends up losing everything. After the breakup with RS, and after K's death, VD \"would really have liked to be mowed down, to In Which the bo dy of VD be comes an el ement in an ex perimental co ntext 85have someone put a bullet in the back of her neck, to finish her off like an animal.\"2 Will I be capable of giving her what she wants? September 2005. Five days before your death. I walk into Le Divan du Monde, see her. She's blond now. She looks a lot younger than she did the first time, as if she'd traveled backward, toward her teenage years. She's standing near the stage with a camera. Her eyes reach me first, before her body. The movements of her fans, gathered together like a swarm of wasps, transform the entire theater into a vor - tex coming toward me. My hair is long. I've hidden a large part of my head under a black winter hat, as if I'm trying to keep my ideas from scattering or being visible to anyone on the outside. I'm a mess; but I'm masculine, which gives me confidence. We exchange shy kisses on the cheek; her smell is intense, animal. We speak a few words to each other. It's impossible for me to remember the details of that conversa-tion. A few seconds of it remain in my brain, like fragments from a silent film. I know the following was said: \"Now I'm a lesbian,\" and \"I've wanted to make it with you since the first time I laid eyes on you.\" We'll come together at a fractal moment, on the edge of a techno-Greek tragedy: she has just started to go out with girls, and I've started to take testosterone. She is becom-ing a lesbian; and, as for me, I'm becoming something other than a girl. She loves breasts, and I love cocks. But she's what I'm looking for. And I'm what she's looking for. She has the cock I need, and I have the breasts she wants. Each 2.

The future: your death, my addiction to testosterone, VD's love. Firs T sexual C OnTraCT Our first contract is very clear: she's the whore; I'm the transsexual. She takes me to a hotel in Pigalle. It's neither night nor day. A translucent winter evening. That day, as we enter our room, she pays me. She wants me to be her slave. She turns on the television, as if she's summoning witnesses to watch what is about to happen. Without losing any time, she says, \"Tomorrow you'll get out of here before I wake up.\" She places her bag on the chair, gets undressed, then falls onto the bed. She stretches out her arms, arrang-ing her body in the form of an S. I look at her, not knowing if I'm supposed to get undressed, too, or not. I don't take anything off. I lie down next to her.

In Which the bo dy of VD be comes an el ement in an ex perimental co ntext 87most rock 'n' roll of all; she's betting on him. Meanwhile, I'm taking in the room, down to its last detail. I glance at her out of the corner of my eye. Under the randomly chang-ing beams of the television, I can see the shape of the areo-las of her nipples, allergy or eczema in the area of her solar plexus; the rest of her skin is very white, her bush short and slightly blond. Next I think of my own nipples under my sweater, my completely shaved pubes, a cut at my right side, the alchemy of the testosterone coursing through my blood. I take turns imagining myself with and without a cock, and the two images keep following each other like a game on a seesaw. But I know that the moment I get undressed, she'll see only one of these bodies. Being reduced to one fixed image frightens me. I keep my clothes on a few minutes more, so I can enjoy the double option a little longer. When I get undressed, she won't know whether or not I have an erection. For me, an erection is an obvious fact, to the same extent in a body without a cock as in a body with one. Then she leans over me, takes control of my legs without touching my pelvis, climbs astride my waist without wast - ing any time on my chest. I stick my tongue out. She takes it with her mouth. When our lips are almost touching, my tongue sharpens like an arrow. Her mouth fucks my tongue, mounting it and descending rapidly. She has found my erec - tion. At times, a lock of her blond hair becomes part of the mechanics. She gently pulls it aside with one hand, using the opportunity to fuck the point of my tongue by raising her head. She changes rhythm. My tongue comes out of my mouth, and she grabs hold of the muscle by folding her palm into the shape of a ring. Her fingernails are impecca-88 I n Which the bo dy of VD be comes an el ement in an ex perimental co ntextbly red; her movements precise, full of class. Our bodies turn in tandem, our pelvises drawn magnetically nearer, united and at the same time separated by the cloth of my trousers. Next, I'm the one who takes her mouth with my tongue. Again and again, until saliva drips onto her breasts. Our bodies turn again, rise upward slightly. My mouth follows the path of the saliva, descending all the way to her vulva. She moans like a hooker, \"Ch\u00e9rie, ch\u00e9ri.\" I suck her while pulling her head backward at the same time. \"Tomorrow, I'll leave when I feel like it, slut.\" The violet light from the tele-vision floods the room. I did say that to her, but actually, I'm afraid of her. Afraid she'll kick me out into the street in the middle of the night. Afraid she'll get up and begin bawl-ing me out. Afraid that she'll rip out the electric sockets with her fingernails. During that time, she has stretched out her arms to cling to the head of the bed. She's ready to come. I get up and leave her like that, like a dismembered animal. I'm thinking of leaving now, to up my masculinity quotient. Instead I put on a harness with an 8\u00bd inch x 1\u00bd inch dildo. Then I come back to fuck her. And I do\u2014for an amorphous period of time that is neither long nor short, until we both come, me first and then she, my whore. Then she falls asleep. I move my arms, feeling entirely help-less. I get up, wash my dildo in the bathroom, take off the harness to soap it up. The suds flow through my fingers. I rinse, then glue it to the tiling with the plunger, leaving that erect organ looking as if it has sprung from the wall, in case somebody comes for a visit. I'll put it away when it's completely dry. I go back into the room. She's sleeping, hasn't changed position; her eyelids are quivering, but her In Which the bo dy of VD be comes an el ement in an ex perimental co ntext 89face is still. They just eliminated a blond teenager from Star Academy , and half the audience is shouting out in despair. I lie down next to her. Can't sleep. I'm waiting for dawn so I can leave. But I fall asleep unexpectedly: in my dream, I'm the one who's the whore, something I knew. When I get up the next morning she's already gone. I unfasten the dildo from the bathroom wall, get dressed, and leave the hotel. alpha biTChes Up to this point, I can't say that my gender revolt has ever put me in the position of victim. Actually, my love affair with VD is the apex of a sexual career as a conquistador without a cock, which began in my very innocent childhood days. Since fifth grade I've gone out only with the sexiest girls of the class, and I don't feature relinquishing that sta-tus. When I was fourteen, my first psychoanalyst explained to me that, fundamentally, I want to arm-wrestle God. I don't see why, on behalf of my mental health, she insists that I relinquish my desire to fuck only those at the top of the femininity pyramid, the alpha bitches, the supersluts\u2014a desire that she calls \"megalomaniacal.\" She thinks this desire is excessive because I'm not a cis-male, who could simply call the same thing \"self-esteem.\" Since childhood I've had a fantastical construction worker's cock. I react to every piece of ass that moves. It doesn't really matter whether it's a cute chick or a mommy, a bourgeois or a peasant, a faggot, bride of Christ, lesbian, or slut. The reaction in my cerebral sex organ is immedi-90 I n Which the bo dy of VD be comes an el ement in an ex perimental co ntextate. All girls, the most beautiful, the most heterosexual, the ones waiting for a Prince Charming full of natural testos - terone, are actually destined without knowing it to become bitches that my dildos penetrate. Until I was twelve, I went to an all-girl Catholic secondary school. A real lesbian para-dise. The best of the little ones were for me. Before they'd even had the time to cross the street and meet the boys at the secondary school opposite, they'd already put their tongues in my mouth. They're mine. I should make it clear, however, that this gravitating of the female sex around me isn't due to my beauty. At the age of four I was diagnosed with a maxillofacial deformation that would become radi-cally more pronounced during my adolescence, to the point of looking grotesque. With the years, I become a myopic monster who was dramatically skinny, had a pronounced jaw and arms and legs that were too long. But during a good part of my childhood and adolescence, obviously because of some unrevealed secret, girls feel attracted to me. They say they're not lesbians, moan and weep after they've let their breasts be fondled and taken off their panties in my room, then stop speaking to me. They denounce me to the teach-ers after shutting themselves up in the girls' room with me and asking me to tell them smutty stories. But they keep the letters that I send them, keep the little ceramic tiles on which I write their name with a pink marker. They fight like warriors possessed by trying to monopolize my attention on the playground. They're mine. Marked forever with the fire of the revolution. One day, when I'm ten, someone calls my home and says to my mother, \"Your daughter is a dyke,\" then hangs up. From that moment on, my mother reads my In Which the bo dy of VD be comes an el ement in an ex perimental co ntext 91notebooks, goes through my pockets, rummages every day through my wallet to make sure I'm not hiding anything weird. She changes into a private detective being hired by the heteropatriarchal regime to disable my novice activities in terrorism: surveillance and home inspections, interroga-tions, interdictions, detentions, censorship . . . Those are the sophisticated methods that the system puts at the dis - posal of a simple housewife from post-Franco Spain to root out the masculine desire living inside my girl's body. My mother and I often argue. She asks me if I'm on drugs, if I'm sleeping with boys, if I'm taking the Pill, if I'm stealing the money that she hides in the linen cabinet between the sheets. I answer no to all her questions. She insists. Tells me that girls like me end up having abortions. That if my father finds out, he'll kill me. I say no to everything she sug-gests. She's taken in by her own lies. I think she's accus - ing me of being a whore to avoid facing what she already knows. She warns me that if I go out with guys from the ETA, 4 she'll tie me up and won't let me leave the house any more. She tortures me until I finally tell her. Simply. Like a confirmation of her worst fears. A lot worse than being any kind of whore, than going to bed with everybody, than having abortions. I've been terrorized, too. But after hav - ing resisted her unrelenting heterosexual surveillance sys - tem, I revel in this moment of truth. With icy cruelty I tell her: I like girls. And immediately after that, without giving her time to answer: I'm a lesbian, a dyke, butch; I'm a boy, and you didn't realize it. I don't want to wear the skirts you 4.

I don't want to be in love, and I don't want to get married; I don't want to comb my dolls' hair. I don't want to be beautiful. I don't want to stay home evenings.

I was born during the dictatorship in a small Spanish city dominated by Catholic Francoism; I was assigned the female gender; Spanish was made my maternal language; I was brought up to be a perfect little girl; I was given an expensive education and private lessons in Latin. In the words of Judith Butler, these are \"forcible reiterations of the norm\" 5 that shaped me. Today I live in several metropolises (four to eight mil- lion inhabitants, counting their suburbs) in which I survive sexually and politically thanks to a network of under - ground microcommunities. My life consists of circulating among different places that are both centers of produc - tion of the dominant discourses and cultural peripheries. I travel among three languages that I think of neither as mine nor as foreign to me. I personify a dyke-transgender condition made up of numerous biocodes, certain of which are normative and others spaces of resistance and still oth-ers potential places for the invention of subjectivity. In any 5. See Judith Butler, Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of Sex (New York: Routledge, 1993), 232. In Which the bo dy of VD be comes an el ement in an ex perimental co ntext 93case, these are artificial environments, synthetic islands of subjectivization that overlay the dominant sexo-urban tissue. Twenty years later, when I go back to the city where I was born to visit my parents, I sometimes run into girls that I loved during my childhood. They're married, have children, dye their hair natural colors, wear leather coats, and actively resist relaxing their neck muscles. They greet me with terrorized surprise. They say to me, \"You haven't changed.\" I'm always the little guy they knew at the school for girls. On the other hand\u2014and this goes for the most bourgeois as much as it does for the most working class\u2014they've already lived the best years of their heterosexual life and are preparing to reach forty, with only the hope of a rejuvenation technique. Some are happy about having children or are justifying not having had them; others seem indifferent; some are still in love with their husbands, or pretend to be. But in a certain way, within a temporary rift, they are still my little girls, my bitches. They still have time for the revolution. addiCTiOn I don't see her for several days. She writes me and tells me that it can't go on, that it isn't going to be possible, that after P , she can't begin another relationship like that, in which there is such a level of connection and everything flows as easily as water. On the fifth day without her, I take another dose of fifty milligrams of testosterone. That night, 94 I n Which the bo dy of VD be comes an el ement in an ex perimental co ntextI don't sleep. I get up several times to reread her emails. I filter them, examine them, read them as the medieval monks read the Bible. Find grace in deciphering them. Quis potest fallere amantem? I remain sitting there on the couch for hours, in the darkness, and I enter a state close to self-hypnosis. I notice that the last four doses of fifty mil-ligrams are interacting for the first time, forming a chemi-cal bond that is getting me high. The skin inside my mouth has become thicker. My tongue is like an erectile muscle. I feel that I could smash the window with my fist. I could leap to the balcony opposite and fuck my neighbor if she were waiting for me with her thighs spread. But this time, like an energizing biosupplement being activated within a female cultural agenda, the testosterone compels me to tidy up and clean my apartment, frenetically, all night long. For a start, a profound and efficient sorting. I make practically no noise. My movements are precise. Eyes, arms, and legs move forward and draw back successively: right, left, for - ward, back. In my library, I move all the piles of Foucault to the cyberpolitics shelf and arrange them under the letter F; I put the Tomatis back in its place, as well as two Eliases, two Bourdieus, the Jo Spence, a Ragan, three Haraways, a Virno, a stack of Butlers in three languages, two Davises, the Nina Roberts; I put the Lemebel first, and the photo of Pedro and Paco both disguised as Frida Kahlo, their wounded hearts united by transparent tubing; I throw the English translation of Flaubert in the garbage, go and get Houellebecq's Rester vivant from the bedroom to put it on my desk. I pick up all the chairs, move the couch, the bed, the TV table, and a chest in order to sweep and mop the In Which the bo dy of VD be comes an el ement in an ex perimental co ntext 95floor with antibacterial soap. I become a disin- fecting process. Justine the bulldog doesn't follow me in my testosterone delirium. She stays on the bed, even when I lift it a foot off the floor to take out what's under it. In less than twenty-five minutes, I've done the entire apartment. It's 5:35 a.m. I open the windows. The night air comes in like a vampire blowing its breath directly into the channels of my neocortex. And, like the other times, I begin to feel again that uncontrollable desire to go out, to feel the city awaken under my feet. So I do. This is the way several days of T go by.Finally her answer arrives: \"Come.\" She takes me to the Terrasse Hotel to make me her whore. I'm completely high on testosterone. I've become witness to my own body's experiencing the opening of new cel-lular centers of reception and excitation, aggressiveness, strength. But this state isn't permanent. The weakness can attack at any moment: once again I can start feeling in love, fragile, and all with somatic certainty, without needing to lie to myself. We've barely made it through the entrance to the hotel when she heads for reception, gives them a pseudonym, opens her great-lady Chanel bag, takes out her credit card, and pays for everything in advance, including two Cokes and two Toblerone bars from the minibar, which we'll have later. I don't make the slightest gesture of want - ing to pay. That's our contract: she pays, I fuck. We walk up to the fourth floor. In the stairway she says to me, \"I want to be able to eat you out right here, right 96 I n Which the bo dy of VD be comes an el ement in an ex perimental co ntextaway.\" Gets undressed without speaking. She touches her nipples, moaning. Her tattoos look like ink bas-reliefs on her alabaster skin. Come. Come. We're at the Terrasse Hotel in the eighteenth arrondissement, where she and CTT filmed the scene from Baise-Moi in which Karen and Raf - fa\u00eblla dance together. Before this, on the beach, with the sea as a background and the car on the sand, Manu has said to Nadine, \"I think we should stay together.\" While they dance, the lyrics of the music repeat, \"It's to see what I want to see, it's to feel what I want to feel.\" This pleasure is unlike any other, even the pleasure of masturbating in front of the television or the pleasure of smoking; it's the pleasure of knowing that they'll stay together whatever happens. After this, they go out and steal credit cards, bump off a girl at a cash machine. On the way back, they choose two guys, go up to their room with them\u2014the room where V and I are now fucking\u2014and they watch each other, from one bed to the other, sharing the pleasure of getting penetrated at the same time. That day, in the same room as Karen and Raff's, we screw naked for the first time. Her pelvis is glued to mine, her vulva connected to mine, our organs gnawing each other like the muzzles of two dogs that recognize each other. As we screw, I feel as if my entire political history, all my years of feminism, are moving directly toward the center of her body and flowing into it, as if her skin provided their only real niche. When I come, Wittig and Davis, Woolf and Solanas, La Pasionaria, Kate Bornstein, and Annie Sprinkle bubble up with me. She is covered with my feminism as if with a diaphanous ejaculation, a sea of political sparkles.In Which the bo dy of VD be comes an el ement in an ex perimental co ntext 97When I wake up later, her hand is inside me. Her entire body has become my cock, is emerging from my loins. But the veins of her arms have a lot more class than the veins of a biocock. I catch her arm between my two hands and rub it from top to bottom as if for a counter-sexual jerk-off. Then I go all the way back to her right shoulder, her neck, and push two fingers into her mouth. She sucks them, without taking her hand off my body. Pleasure follows this arrange-ment of forces, this hierarchy of functions whose stability is necessarily precarious. We go on like that until I come in her hand, until my hand comes in her mouth. We leave the hotel. My elbows are burning. Fucking her is harder than factory work, harder than driving a truck loaded with nitroglycerine in a cowboy film. She tears off my skin, every time.98 I n Which the bo dy of VD be comes an el ement in an ex perimental co ntext99The invention of the category gender signaled a splitting off and became the source point for the emergence of the pharmacopornographic regime for producing and govern- ing sexuality. Far from its being the creation of a feminist agenda, the notion of gender belongs to the biotechnological discourse that appeared in the US medical and therapeutic industries at the end of the 1940s. Gender and pharmaco-pornographic masculinity and femininity are artifacts that originated with industrial capitalism and would reach com-mercial peaks during the Cold War, just like canned food, computers, plastic chairs, nuclear energy, television, credit cards, disposable ballpoint pens, bar codes, inflatable mat - tresses, or telecommunications satellites. In 1955, the child psychologist John Money, who treated \"hermaphrodites\" and \"intersex babies,\" became the first to make use of the grammatical category of gender a s a clinical and diagnosis tool. He would develop it with Anke Ehrhardt and Joan and John Hampson as part of a set of potential hormonal or surgical techniques to modify the bodies of babies born with genitals or chromosomes that medicine\u2014relying on its visual and discursive criteria\u20146. teChnogendercouldn't classify as strictly female or male.1 To the rigid nineteenth-century categorizations of sex, John Money opposed the malleability of gender , using social and bio- chemical techniques. When he used gender as a name for \"social role\" or \"psychological identity,\" he was essentially thinking of the possibility of using technologies (from hor-mones to social techniques, such as those employed in ped-agogic and administrative institutions) to modify the body or to produce subjectivity intentionally in order to conform to a preexisting visual and biopolitical order, which was prescriptive for what was supposed to be a female or male human body. 2 In order to ensure that their external \"sexual\" development could be identified as feminine, newborns declared to be \"intersex\" because they possessed a \"micro-penis\" (according to somato-political visual criteria) had it amputated, and their genitals were reconstructed in the form of a vagina, after which they received hormone-sub-stitution therapy. 3 Intersex activists have pointed out the similarity between traditional non-Western cliterodectomy techniques and industrialized practices of genital mutila-tion on intersex bodies in the West. 4 Far as they were from the rigidity and exteriority of techniques of normalization 1.

Like the Pill or the oncomouse, gender is a biotech industrial artifact. The technologies of gender, sex, sexu-ality, and race are the true economicopolitical sectors of pharmacopornism. They are technologies of production of somatic fictions. Male and female are terms without empiri- cal content beyond the technologies that produce them. That being the case, the recent history of sexuality appears as a gigantic pharmacopornographic Disneyland in which the tropes of sexual naturalism are fabricated on a global scale as products of the endocrinological, surgical, agrifood and media industries. Whereas Money tampered with the bodies of infants to force them into the categories of \"male gender\" or \"female gender,\" Dr. Henry Benjamin administered estrogens and progesterone to a new kind of patient of state-managed medicine: an adult who claims not to identify with the gen-der that was assigned at birth. Curiously, the criteria for the assignment of gender, as well as those for its reassignment in cases of transsexuality, function according to two meta-physical models of the body that are nearly irreconcilable. On the one hand, the criteria for sex assignment that per - mit a decision regarding whether or not a body is \"female\" or \"male\" at the moment of birth (or in utero, using a Technogender 101sonogram) depend on a model of visual recognition that is supposedly empirical and in which the signifiers (chromo-somes, size of the genitals, etc.) are cast as scientific truths. In this case, making a body visible implies that it is being assigned a male or female gender in a univocal and defini- tive way. This unveiling of gender depends on an optical ontology: the real is what you can see. On the other hand, the idea that posits a true \"psychological sex\" distinct from the one that has been assigned at birth\u2014in other words, a subjective conviction of being a \"man\" or a \"woman\"\u2014belongs to the model of radical invisibility, of the nonrepre-sentable, and this paradigm is close to that of the Freudian unconscious: an immaterial ontology. In this case, the real isn't accessible to the senses and is by definition what can-not be apprehended by empirical means. These two models can function together thanks to a single metaphysical axis that attaches them as it opposes them. It's necessary to imagine the biopolitical ideals of masculinity and feminin-ity as transcendental essences from which are suspended aesthetics of gender, normative codes of visual recognition, and immaterial psychological convictions prompting the subject to proclaim itself male or female, heterosexual or homosexual, cis- or trans. However, the visual criteria that govern sex assignment at birth are not a biological event any more than are the psychological criteria that lead to the \"inner\" conviction of being a man or a woman: \"Physi-cal genitals are a construction of biological and scientific forms of life.\" 5 Penises and vaginas are biocodes of power- 5.

They are ideal regulators, biopolitical fictions that find their somatic support in individual subjec - tivity.6 The pharmacopornographic sex-gender regime is the result of the unexpected alliance between the nineteenth-century naturalist metaphysics of sexual dimorphism, focused on heterosexual reproduction, and the rise of a hyperconstructivist medical and biotech industry in which gender roles and identities can be artificially designed. 7 Plato meets Money in the high-tech gender garage. The hyperbolic production of the postwar medical dis - course on gender is the sign of an epistemic crisis: the endless \"nature versus nurture\" debates of the 1950s-70s that involved John Money, David O. Caudwell, Robert Stoller, Henry Benjamin, Richard Green, or Milton Dia-mond remind us of sixteenth-century tricks on spheres and epicycles whose aim was to maintain the hegemony of the geocentric astronomical model. The proliferation of the clinical discourse hermaphroditism,\" \"pseudo-hermaphroditism,\" \"intersexuality,\" \"sexual incongruities,\" and \"psychopathia transexualis,\" 8 as well as the medical normalization of techniques of sex reassignment, genital mutilation of intersex babies, and surgical reconstruction of gender, are nothing other than desperate (and violent) measures to reinforce a shattered epistemology. In the 1950s, which were confronted with the political rise of fem-inism and with homosexuality, as well as with the desire 6.

Nine-teenth-century disciplinary epistemology was grounded on the biopolitical imperative of the heterosexual reproduc - tion of the nation's population. As Suzanne J. Kessler and Wendy McKenna put it, human bodies were \"diagnosed\" male or female at birth as potential \"sperm and egg cell car - riers.\" 9 But \"sperm and egg cell carriers\" were gaining new political agency over their reproductive power. Moreover, new techniques in the 1950s for reading genetic and chro-mosomal differences and measuring endocrinological lev - els introduced variables that could not be reduced to the epistemological framework of sexual dimorphism. Medical, biological, and political discourses were confronted with an infinite variability of bodies and desires (multiple chromo-somal, gonadal, hormonal, external genital, psychological, and political variables) that could not be subsumed within the disciplinary imperative of heterosexual reproduction. John Money puts it this way: In human beings, the irreducible sex differences are that males impregnate, and females menstruate, ges - tate, and lactate. Otherwise, sexual dimorphism that is programmed into the brain under the influence of pre-natal hormones appears to be not sex-irreducible, but sex-shared and threshold-dimorphic. A complete theory of the differentiation of all the constituents of masculinity or femininity of the gender identity role needs to be both 9. Kessler and McKenna, \"Toward a Theory of Gender,\" in The Transgender Studies Reader , 180.104 T echnogendermultivariable and sequential in type. It must be applica- ble to all the syndromes of hermaphroditism, and to the genesis of the gender identity role phenomena, including transvestism and transsexualism, as well as to the genesis of a heterosexual gender identity role. 10 But in the late 1950s, males are no longer guaranteed to impregnate, females stop menstruating and gestating under the effects of the contraceptive pill, and lactation is provided by food industries instead of by female breasts. The heterosexual dimorphic regime of \"sperm and egg cell carriers\" is going awry. Instead of collectively producing an alternative (mul- timorphic) epistemology for understanding bodies and desires, the 1950s medical, biological, and political dis - courses decided to directly intervene within the structures of living beings to artificially construct sexual dimorphism using surgical, prosthetic, and hormonal techniques sup-ported by the pharmacological, medical, and food indus - tries. 11 When the possibility of the technical construction of sexual difference is recognized as a point of departure, nature and identity are brought to the level of a somatic parody. Whereas the disciplinary system of the nineteenth century considered sex to be natural, definitive, unchange-able, and transcendental, pharmacopornographic gender seems to be synthetic, malleable, variable, open to transfor - 10.

Strangely, the medical and biotechnological dimen- sions of gender production were ignored within the \"cul-tural\" version of white feminism's constructivism, which reappropriated the notion of \"gender\" in order to recast it as an instrument of critical analysis of the oppression of women. Gender appears gradually in the anthropological or sociological texts of Margaret Mead or Ann Oakley as the social and cultural construction of sexual difference. 12 The feminist culturalist definitions of gender have been the source of two stumbling blocks whose disastrous effects are still at work in the current \"politics of gender\" that main-tain that sex, an anatomical truth, is a biological given and therefore isn't subject to cultural construction, whereas gender specifically expresses the social, cultural, and politi-cal difference of women in a society and at a particular his - torical moment. In this context, there's nothing surprising about feminism's finding itself on a dead-end street of the essentialism/constructivism debates or regarding the poli-tics of the state's facility in co-opting feminist rhetoric into an extensive program of sexual normalization and social control. Why didn't 1970s culturalist and constructivist feminists fight against clinical diagnosis, reassignment protocols for intersex bodies, normalizing biochemical and surgical technologies, and the binary regime within administrative systems? Intersex activist Cheryl Chase answers: \"Intersexuals have had such difficulty generating 12. One of the first texts where this difference is clearly thematicized is Ann Oakley, Sex, Gender and Society (London: Maurice Temple Smith, Ltd., 1972).

In the 1980s, Teresa de Lauretis and Judith Butler started to point out that second-wave feminism uncritically shared the very epistemological sex-gender framework it aimed to question. Lauretis claimed that feminist \"theory\" could not be evinced unless it examined its own critical foundations, political terms, linguistic prac - tices, and practices of the production of visibility. Lauretis asked what the political subject produced by feminism as a discourse and practice of representation was. Stripped of all self-indulgence, her conclusion takes the form of an extremely lucid warning: feminism functions, or can function, as an instrument of normalization and political control when it reduces its subject to \"women.\" Under the apparent neutrality and universality of the term woman , a host of vectors of production and subjectivity are hiding: sex, race, class, sexuality, age, ability, geopolitical or corpo-ral difference, and so on. In Lauretian terms, the subject of feminism is inevitably eccentric ; rather than coinciding with \"women,\" it arises as a force of displacement, as a practice for the transformation of subjectivity. 14 13. Chase, \"Hermaphrodites,\" in The Transgender Studies Reader , 312. 14. Teresa de Lauretis, \"Eccentric Subjects: Feminist Theory and Historical Consciousness,\" Feminist Studies 16, no. 1 (Spring 1990): 115-50.Technogender 107In order to question the conflation of gender and woman, Teresa de Lauretis developed the notion of \"technologies of gender.\"15 For Lauretis, filmmaking devices\u2014specific modes of recording, projection, montage, signification, and decoding\u2014serve as a paradigm for conceiving of the production of gender and sexual subjectivity. This amounts to saying that the pharmacopornographic regime func - tions like a machine of somatic representation in which text, image, and the corporal spread through the interior of an expansive cybernetic circuit. According to Laurentis's semiotic-political interpretation, gender is the effect of a system of signification that includes modes of production and decoding of politically regulated visual and textual signs. The subject, who is simultaneously the producer and interpreter of these signs, is constantly involved in a cor - poral process of signification, representation, and self-rep-resentation. Transposing Foucault's critique Metz's cinematographic semiotics to feminism, Lauretis writes: It seemed to me that gender was not the simple deriva- tion of anatomical/biological sex but a sociocultural con-struction, a representation, or better, the compounded effect of discursive and visual representations which I saw emanating from various institutions\u2014the family, religion, the educational system, the media, medicine, or law\u2014but also from less obvious sources: language, art, literature, film, and so on. However, the constructed-ness or discursive nature of gender does not prevent it from 15. See Teresa de Lauretis, Technologies of Gender: Essays on Theory, Film, and Fiction (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1987).108 T echnogenderhaving real implications, or concrete effects, both social and subjective, for the material life of individuals. On the contrary, the reality of gender is precisely in the effects of its representation; gender is realized, becomes \"real\" when that representation becomes a self-representation, is individually assumed as a form of one's social and sub-jective identity. 16 Lauretis displaces the naturalized notion of \"woman\" with \"gender\" while translating the question of the \"dia- lectics of oppression\" into a multiplicity of \"technologies.\" The issue of this conceptual difference between gender and woman, between \"technologies of power\" and \"dialectics of oppression\" isn't limited to nominal questions of transla-tion or semantics. The issue directly concerns body technol-ogies and devices of subjectification. This distinction has the potential to disrupt the entire grammar of feminism, and even the entire political history of the production of difference between the sexes. Whereas the feminism of the 1970s studied the sources of the oppression of women, Lauretis invites us to identify the functioning of a collec - tion of technologies of gender, operating across bodies that produce not only differences of gender but also sexual, racial, somatic, class, age, disability, and other differences. As a result, a new field of study has been established for feminism: the analysis of different technologies of gender that produce (always in a precarious, unstable way) bodies, 16. Teresa de Lauretis, \"Gender Identities and Bad of enunciation and action. It goes without saying that research about these technologies of gender cannot, in any case, be reduced to a statistical or sociological study of women's situation in the different domains of produc - tion of bodies, discourses, and representations. 17 The issue no longer comes down to considering gender as a cultural force that comes to modify a biologically determined foun-dation (sex). Instead, it is subjectivity as a whole, produced within the techno-organic circuits that are codified in terms of gender, sex, race, and sexuality through which pharma-copornographic capital circulates. With Lauretis, Judith Butler introduced the largest and most acute critique of both gender-sex epistemology and the grammar of feminism. For Butler, gender is a system of rules, conventions, social norms, and institutional prac - tices that performatively produce the subject they claim to describe. Through a cross-referenced reading of Austin, Derrida, and Foucault, Butler reaches a consideration of gender in which it is no longer an essence or psychological truth, but a discursive, corporal, and performative practice by means of which the subject acquires social intelligibility and political recognition. 18 Today, this Butlerian analysis comes together with Donna J. Haraway's lessons for exam-ining the semiotechnical dimension of this performative production: pushing the performative hypothesis further into the body, as far as its organs and fluids; drawing it into the cells, chromosomes, and genes. 17.

See Butler's Gender Trouble, Bodies That Matter, and Undoing Gender. 110 T echnogenderThe clinical notion of gender invented by Money sees it above all as an instrument of rationalization for a living being whose visible body is only one of the parameters. The invention of gender as an organizing principle was necessary for the appearance and development of a series of pharmacopornographic techniques for the normaliza-tion and transformation of living beings\u2014a process that includes photographing \"deviants,\" cellular diagnosis, hor - monal analysis and therapy, chromosomal readings, and transsexual and intersexual surgery. Photography, invented at the end of the nineteenth century, before the appearance and perfection of hormonal and surgical techniques, signaled a crucial stage in the production of the new sexual subject and its visual truth. Of course, this process of representation of the body had already begun in the seventeenth century with anatomical and pornographic drawings, 19 but it is photography that would endow this technical production of the materiality of the body with the merit of visual realism. Let us take the example of one of the classical images by F\u00e9lix Nadar 20 rep- resenting \"hermaphrodites\" and \"inverts\": a body, named \"X\" in medical histories, appears in a supine position with legs spread, covered with a white slip that has been raised to the level of the chest, exposing the upper part of the pelvis. The genitals have been unveiled to the eyes of the camera by a hand coming from outside the frame. The image reveals its own process of discursive production. It shares its codes 19. Laqueur, Making Sex, 154-63. 20. Nadar photographed a \"hermaphrodite\" patient around 1860 at the behest of the French physician Armand Trousseau.Technogender 111of representation with the pornography that appears at the same period; the doctor's hand hides and exhibits the genitals, thus establishing a power relationship between the subject and the object of representation. The face and, especially, the eyes of the patient have been effaced; the deviant cannot be the agent of his/her own representation. The truth of sex takes on the nature of a visual disclosure, a process in which photography participates like an ontologi-cal catalyst, making explicit a reality that wouldn't be able to emerge any other way. A century later, in 1980, the anthropologist Susan Kessler will denounce the aesthetic codes (relying on the shape and form of the penis and the clitoris) that dominate medical protocol for the assignment of sex to newborns. Although the visual criteria for sex assignment may not seem to have changed very much since the end of the nine-teenth century, the current technical possibilities of body modification are introducing substantial differences in the process of the assignment and production of feminin-ity and masculinity in the pharmacopornographic era. The process of normalization (assignment, reassignment) that could be accomplished only by discursive or photographic representation in the past is now inscribed within the very structure of the living being by surgical, endocrinological, and even genetic techniques. After World War II, human mapping in the West, charac - terized by sexual dimorphism and its classification of sexu-alities as normal or deviant, healthy or disabled, becomes dependent on the legal and commercial management of molecules essential to the production of phenotypes 112 T echnogender(external signs) that are culturally recognized as female or male (facial hair, size and shape of the genitals, voice reg-ister . . . ), as well as on the technopolitical management of the reproduction of the species and on the pharmacologi-cal control of our immune systems and their resistance to aggression, illness, and death. There have been several regimes of body production\u2014 political regimes for producing and reproducing human life on the planet, depending on the historical moment and the political, economic, and cultural context. Some lost their potential for subjectification (for example, matriarchy or Greek pedophilia) when the political technoecologies inside of which they functioned disappeared. Others are undergo-ing full mutation. This is the case with ours. If the concept of gender has introduced a rift, the pre- cise reason is that it represents the first self-conscious moment within the epistemology of sexual difference. From this point on, there is no going back; Money is to the history of sexuality what Hegel is to the history of philoso-phy and Einstein to the conception of space-time. It is the beginning of the end, the explosion of sex-nature, nature-history, time and space as linearity and extension. With the notion of gender, the medical discourse is unveiling its arbitrary foundations and its constructivist character, and at the same time opening the way for new forms of resis - tance and political action. When I bring up the idea of a rift introduced by the notion of gender, I'm not claiming to be referring to the passage from one political paradigm to a radically distinct other, or to an epistemological rupture that will give rise to a form of radical discontinuity. Rather, Technogender 113I'm referring to a superimposition of strata in which differ - ent techniques of producing and managing life are inter - lacing and overlapping. The pharmacopornographic body is not passive living matter but a techno-organic interface, a technoliving system segmented and territorialized by different (textual, data-processing, biochemical) political technologies. Let us examine, for example, the displacement of produc - tion of body hair from the disciplinary sex regime to the gender pharmacopornographic regime. In the sexodis - ciplinary system of the nineteenth century, the \"bearded lady\" was considered to be a monstrous abnormality, and her body was becoming visible within the spectacularized framework of circuses and freak shows. In the pharmaco-pornographic regime, \"hirsutism\" has become a clinical condition, making women potential clients of the medical system and consumers of manufactured molecules (spe-cifically, Androcur, which is administered to neutralize testosterone production, but also insulin regulators), the purpose of which is not hormonal, but political, normaliza-tion. After 1961, hirsutism was measured by the Ferriman-Gallwey scale, which examines nineteen body areas (from sideburns to toes) to assess normal hair growth. 21 The Ferriman-Gallwey score establishes a correlation between 21. David Ferriman and J.D. Gallwey, \"Clinical Assessment of Body Hair Growth in Women,\" Journal of Clinical Endocrinology 21, no. 11 (November 1961): 1440-7.114 T echnogendergender, ethnicity, and hair; for example, in a Caucasian woman a score of eight is regarded as indicative of andro-gen excess whereas in East Asian and Native American women a much lower score reveals hirsutism. According to the same clinical method, Ashkenazi Jews and Hispanic women are \"high-risk ethnic groups.\" 22 Hirsutism becomes here a method to clinically assess race as much as gender. Biopolitical loop: femininity-body-hair-visibility, circus- hirsutism-Androcur-race-cosmetic-treatment-invisibility- femininity. Different \"techniques of the body\" 23 and visual frameworks produce different somato-political living fic - tions: formerly exhibited in the circus, the racialized phar - macopornographic hirsute body becomes the object of the plastic surgery clinic and the beauty salon and their tech-niques of hormonal regulation and electrolysis. In the changing definitions of gender, there is no succes - sion of models (sovereign, disciplinary, and pharmacopor - nographic) about to be supplanted historically by others, or any ruptures or radical discontinuities, but rather an inter - connected simultaneity, a transversal effect of multiple somato-political models that compose and implement sub-jectivity according to various intensities, different indexes of penetration, and different degrees of efficiency. 22.

Whereas the nose is regu-lated by a pharmacopornographic power in which an organ is considered to be private property and merchandise, the genitals are still imprisoned in a premodern, sovereign, and nearly theocratic power regime that considers them to be the property of the state and dependent on unchanging transcendental law. But in the pharmacopornographic soci-ety, a conflicting multiplicity of power-knowledge regimes is operating simultaneously on different organs, tearing the body apart. We are not bodies without organs, but rather an array of heterogeneous organs unable to be gathered under the same skin. Those who survive the mutation that is happening will see their bodies moving into a new semio-technical system and will witness the proliferation of new organs; in other words, they'll cease to be the bodies that they were before. When it comes to such transformations of the living body, the outlines of the problem become clearer. Pharma- 24. See Dean Spade, \"Mutilating Gender,\" in The Transgender Studies Reader eds. Susan Stryker and Stephen Whittle (New York: Routledge, 2006), 315-52.116 T echnogendercopornographic gender is neither metaphor nor ideology; it can't be reduced to a performance: it is a form of political technoecology. The certainty of being a man or a woman is a somato-political biofiction produced by a collection of body technologies, pharmacologic and audiovisual tech-niques that determine and define the scope of our somatic potentialities and function like prostheses of subjectifica-tion. Gender is an operational program capable of trigger - ing a proliferation of sensory perceptions under the form of affects, desires, actions, beliefs, and identities. One of the characteristic results of such a technology of gender is the production of inner knowledge about oneself, with a sense of a sexual self that appears to be an emotional reality that is evident to consciousness. \"I am a man,\" \"I \"I am transsexual\": these are units of specific knowledge about oneself, hard biopolitical nuclei around which it's possible to assemble an entire collection of discourses and performative practices. We could call the \"programming of gender\" a psycho- political neoliberal modeling of subjectivity that potenti-ates the production of subjects that think of themselves and behave like individual bodies, aware of themselves as private organic spaces and biological properties with fixed identities of gender and sexuality. The prevailing programming of gender operates with the following prem-ise: an individual = a healthy body = a sex = a gender = a sexuality = a private property. But constructing gender, as Butler has argued, always amounts to taking the risk of dismantling it. Producing gender implies a collection of Technogender 117strategies of naturalization/denaturalization and identifi- cation/disidentification. Drag king devices and hormonal self-experimentation are only two of these derailment strategies. Within the pharmacopornographic regime, gender is constructed in industrial networks of biopolitical mate-rialization; it is reproduced and reinforced socially by its transformation into entertainment, moving images, digital data, pharmacological molecules, cybercodes. Pharmaco-pornographic female or male gender exists before a public audience, as a somato-discursive construction of a collec - tive nature, facing a scientific community or a network. Technogender is a public, scientific, community cortisone, the estrogens, omeprazole, testosterone, and so on, correspond to the group of molecules currently available for the manufac - turing of subjectivity and its affects. We are technobiopo-litically equipped to screw, reproduce the National Body, and consume. We live under the control of molecular tech-nologies, hormonal straitjackets intended to maintain biopower: hyperestrogened bodies-rape-testosterone-love-pregnancy-sex drives-abjection-ejaculation. And the state draws its pleasure from the production and control of our pornogore subjectivity. The objective of these pharmacopornographic technolo- gies is the production of a living political prosthesis: a body 118 T echnogenderthat is compliant enough to put its potentia gaudendi , its total and abstract capacity for creating pleasure, at the ser - vice of the production of capital and the reproduction of the species. Outside such somato-political ecology of \"sperm and egg carriers,\" there are neither men nor women, just as there is neither heterosexuality nor homosexuality, neither ableness nor disability. Our contemporary societies are gigantic sexopolitical labo- ratories where the genders are produced. The body\u2014each and every one of our bodies\u2014is the invaluable enclave where transactions of power are ceaselessly carried out. My body = the multitude's body. Postwar white men and women are biotechnological beings belonging to the sexo-political regime, whose goal is the production, reproduc - tion, and colonial expansion of heterosexual human life on the planet. Beginning in the 1940s, the new biopolitical ideals of masculinity and femininity were created under laboratory conditions. These artifacts (us) can't exist in a pure state, but only within our enclosed sexual technoecosystems. In our role as sexual subjects, we're inhabiting biocapitalist amusement parks. We are men and women of the labora-tory, effects of a kind of politicoscientific bio-Platonism. We are strange biopolitical fictions because we are alive: we are simultaneously the effect of the pharmacopornographic power (biopower ) regime and the potential for its defeat (bioempowerment).Technogender 119some semiotechnical codes of white heterosexual femininity belonging to the postwar pharmacopornographic political ecology: Little Women , a mother's courage, the Pill, the hyperloaded cocktail of estrogens and progesterone, the honor of virgins, Sleeping Beauty, bulimia, the desire for a child, the shame of deflowering, The Little Mermaid, silence in the face of rape, Cinderella, the ultimate immorality of abortion, cakes and cookies, knowing how to give a good blowjob, bromazepam, the shame about not having done it yet, Gone with the Wind, saying no when you want to say yes, not leaving home, hav - ing small hands, Audrey Hepburn's ballet shoes, codeine, taking care of your hair, fashion, saying yes when you want to say no, anorexia, knowing in secret that the one you're really attracted to is your best friend, fear of growing old, the need to be on a diet constantly, the beauty imperative, kleptomania, compassion, cooking, the desperate sensual-ity of Marilyn Monroe, the manicure, not making any noise when you walk, not making any noise when you eat, not making any noise, the immaculate and carcinogenic cotton of Tampax, the certainty that maternity is a natural bond, not knowing how to cry, not knowing how to fight, not knowing how to kill, not knowing much or knowing a lot but not being able to say it, knowing how to wait, the sub-dued elegance of Lady Di, Prozac, fear of being a bitch in heat, Valium, the necessity of the G-string, knowing how to restrain yourself, letting yourself be fucked in the ass when it's necessary, being resigned, accurate waxing of the pubes, depression, thirst, little lavender balls that smell good, the smile, the living mummification of the smooth face of 120 T echnogenderyouth, love before sex, breast cancer, being a kept woman, being left by your husband for a younger woman . . . some semiotechnical codes of white heterosexual masculinity belonging to the postwar pharmacopornographic political ecology: James Bond, soccer, wearing pants, knowing how to raise your voice, Platoon , knowing how to kill, knowing how to smash somebody's face, mass media, stomach ulcers, the precariousness of paternity as a natural bond, overalls, sweat, war (including the television version), Bruce Wil-lis, Operation Desert Storm, speed, terrorism, sex for sex's sake, getting hard like Ron Jeremy, knowing how to drink, earning money, Rocky , Prilosec, the city, bars, hookers, boxing, the garage, the shame of not getting hard like Ron Jeremy, Viagra, prostate cancer, broken noses, philosophy, gastronomy, Scarface , having dirty hands, Bruce Lee, pay - ing alimony to your ex-wife, conjugal violence, horror films, porn, gambling, bets, the government, the state, the cor - poration, cold cuts, hunting and fishing, boots, the tie, the three-day growth of beard, alcohol, coronaries, balding, the Grand Prix, journey to the Moon, getting plastered, hang-ing yourself, big watches, callused hands, keeping your anus squeezed shut, camaraderie, bursts of laughter, intel-ligence, encyclopedic knowledge, sexual obsessions, Don Juanism, misogyny, being a skinhead, serial killers, heavy metal, leaving your wife for a younger woman, fear of get - ting fucked in the ass, not seeing your children after the divorce, the desire to get fucked in the ass . . .Technogender 121For a long time I believed that only people like me were really in deep shit.

White heterosexual femininity is, above all, an economic function referring to a specific posi-tion within biopolitical relationships of production and exchange, and based on the transformation of sex work, the work of pregnancy, body care, and other unpaid activ - ity within industrial capitalism. 25 This sexualized economy functions through what Judith Butler has called perfor - mative coercion:26 by means of semiotechnical, linguistic, and corporal processes of regulated repetitions imposed by cultural conventions. It's impossible to imagine the rapid expansion of industrial capitalism without the slave trade, colonial expropriation, and the institutionalization of the heterosexual dispositif as a mode of transformation in sur - plus value of unpaid sexual services historically performed by women. It is reasonable to posit an unpaid debt for sex work that heterosexual men historically contracted with regard to women, in the same way that Western countries 25. Wittig, 58-59. 26. Judith Butler, Gender Trouble. 122 T echnogender27. Frantz Fanon, \"De la violence,\" in in Oeuvres (Paris: La D\u00e9couverte, 2011), 503. should be, according to Franz Fanon, forced to reimburse a colonial debt to colonized peoples.27 If interest were applied to the debt for sexual services and colonial plundering, all women and colonized peoples on the planet would receive an annuity that would allow them to spend the rest of their lives without working. Heterosexuality hasn't always existed. The contemporary transformation of capitalism entails a mutation of the sex-gender order. If we look attentively at the signs of technification and informatization of gender that emerge starting with World War II, we can even affirm that het - erosexuality has been summoned to disappear one day. In fact, it is in the act of disappearing now. The postsexual era will then begin as a secondary effect of the pharmacoporno industry. This means that there will no longer be sexual relations between cis-males and cis-females and that the conditions of sexual production (production of bodies and pleasures) are drastically changing, that they will begin to resemble more and more closely the production of bodies and deviant pleasures, under the control of the same phar - macopornographic regulations. In other words, all forms of sexuality and production of pleasure, all libidinal and bio-political economies are now subject to the same molecular and digital technologies of the production of sex, gender, and sexuality. The normative premises of the nineteenth-century Technogender 123disciplinary sexual regime (continuity between sexuality and reproduction and pathologization of nonreproduc - tive practices, including masturbation and homosexuality) were radically displaced with the invention of the Pill and the making of pornography into a branch of popular media industries that transformed masturbation into a source of production of capital. But the technoliving park of which we are part isn't completely coherent and integrated. The two poles of the pharmacopornographic industry (phar - maco and porno) function more in opposition than they do in tandem. Although the pornography industry as a whole works as cultural propaganda for the gender dimorphic regime (producing normative and idealized representations of heterosexual and homosexual practice, where sexuality equals penetration with a biopenis) and the political asym-metry between cis-males and cis-females is legitimized as based on anatomical differences (cis-male = biopenis; cis-female = biovagina), the pharmaceutical and biotechnical industries and the new techniques of assisted reproduc - tion\u2014even if they do continue to function in a heteronor - mative legal framework\u2014are ceaselessly redesigning the frontiers between the genders and, as a whole, turning the economic, heterosexual, and political system into an obso-lete means of management of subjectivity. The dialectic between pharmaco and porno is already arising in the contradictions between various (low-tech or high-tech) biocodes of subjectivity coming from different regimes of production of the body. For example, families (whether heterosexual, homosexual, or monoparental) in which reproduction has been accomplished by in vitro fer -124 T echnogendertilization with anonymous donor sperm continue to func - tion in a politicolegal system in which the performative ideals of masculinity and kinship have not been challenged. Moreover, the biocodes of the production of subjectivity (both those that are semiotic and those that are pharma-ceutical, from Viagra to testosterone, by way of the aes - thetics of the gay body or sexual practices using synthetic organs) are circulating within the pharmacopornographic market without any possibility of controlling the processes of production of subjectivity that they are inducing. Thus, biocodes (language, ways of dressing, hormones, pros - theses) that once belonged to feminine, masculine, het - erosexual, homosexual, transsexual, or even genderqueer configurations can achieve means of expression that are denaturalized and offbeat and free of a sexual identity or a precise biopolitical subjectivity. A way of life or an identity agenda. The visual codes governing the transformed face of Courtney Love, a rock icon, are not at all different from those used to rejuvenate the face of the queen of Spain, the actress Pamela Anderson, Chen Lili (the transsexual woman who attempted to compete in the Miss Universe contest in 2004), or the lesbian star Ellen DeGeneres, or from those used in remodeling the face of an anonymous working-class cis-female who wins the right to participate in the American TV show Extreme Makeover . As a result, we are witnessing a horizontalization of the consumption of the techniques of production of the body that redistrib-utes the differences between class, race, or sexual identi-ties, between the culture of rock music, high society, and the porn industry. This pharmacopornographic shifting is a Technogender 125sign that normative white heterosexuality will soon be one body aesthetic among many others, a retro reproductive style that various future generations will be able to deni-grate or exalt, a low-tech reproduction machine possibly exportable to other parts of the world (even an excuse for waging war against Muslim countries), but completely out of date and decadent in Western democratic post-Judeo-Christian societies. Fifty years after the invention of the Pill, all sexual bod- ies are produced and become intelligible according to a common pharmacopornographic epistemology. There are not body biotechnologies that differ but the administra-tive systems that, as Dean Spade argues, sort and manage the access and use of those technologies, distributing life chances according to class, race, ability, gender, or sexual-ity. 28 Today, a cis-male can self-administer a testosterone- based hormonal complex to increase his athletic efficiency, and a teenager can have an implant placed under her skin that releases a composite of estrogens and progesterone for three years, acting as a contraceptive; a cis-female who claims to be a man can sign an agreement for a sex change and receive endocrinal therapy with a base of tes - tosterone that makes it possible to grow a beard and mus - tache and increases muscularity; a cis-female of sixty may discover that more than twenty years of swallowing her high-strength contraceptive pill has caused kidney failure or breast cancer that she is supposed to treat with chemo-therapy resembling what the victims of Chernobyl were 28.

The same testosterone that helps turn the wheels of the Tour de France serves to transform the bodies of F2M transsexuals . . . The question is, who has access to hormone treatments? According to which clinical diagnosis? How do class and race modify the distribution of and the access to technologies of production of gender? All this suggests that a normative regime for segregated distribution of race, class, gender, sexuality, and ability coexists with the process of \"becoming common\" 29 of tech - nologies of the production of body, gender, sex, race, and sexuality. From now on, the mutation will be impossible to stop. In the middle of the Cold War, a new ontological-politi- cal distinction between \"cis-\" (a body that keeps the gender it was assigned at birth) and \"trans\" (a body availing itself of hormonal, surgical, prosthetic, or legal technologies to change that assignment) made its appearance. Henceforth, I will use the nomenclature cis- and trans , with the under - standing that these two biopolitical gender statuses are technically produced. Both of them fall within the prov - ince of common methods of visual recognition, performa-tive production, and morphological control. The difference between \"cis-\" and \"trans\" is enumerated as a function of resistance to the norm of the consciousness of those tech-Technogender 127nical (pharmacopornographic) processes that produce somatic fictions of masculinity and femininity and as a function of scientific techniques and social recognition in public space. This implies no judgment about value: \"trans\" gender is neither better nor more political than \"cis-\" gen-der. It comes down to saying that, in ontopolitical terms, there are only technogenders. Photographic, biotechnolog-ical, surgical, pharmacological, cinematographic, or cyber - netic techniques come to construct the materiality of the sexes performatively . Some transsexuals claim to have been born \"imprisoned in the body of the opposite sex\" and say that the technical mechanisms placed at their disposal by contemporary medicine are only a way of revealing their true, authentic sex. Others, like Kate Bornstein, Del LaGrace Volcano, or Susan Stryker, 30 affirm their status as gender queers, or gender deviants, and refuse any summons as man or woman, declaring them to be impositions of the norm. Del LaGrace Volcano puts it this way: As a gender variant visual artist I access \"technologies of gender\" in order to amplify rather than erase the her - maphroditic traces of my body. I name myself. A gender abolitionist. A part time gender terrorist. An intentional mutation and intersex by design, (as opposed to diagno-sis), in order to distinguish my journey from the thousands of intersex individuals who have had their \"ambiguous\" bodies mutilated and disfigured in a misguided attempt at \"normalization.\" 31 30.

In other words, it cannot function without the constant trafficking of gender biocodes. Gender in the twenty-first century functions as an abstract mechanism for technical subjectification; it is spliced, cut, moved, cited, imitated, swallowed, injected, transplanted, digitized, copied, con-ceived of as design, bought, sold, modified, mortgaged, transferred, downloaded, enforced, translated, falsified, fabricated, swapped, dosed, administered, extracted, con-tracted, concealed, negated, renounced, betrayed . . .

No political power exists without con-trol over production and distribution of gender biocodes. Pharmacopornographic emancipation of subaltern bodies can be measured only according to these essential criteria: involvement in and access to the production, circulation, and interpretation of somato-politic biocodes.Technogender 129130Victor, the lover I left for VD, has been working for six months for a phone sex chat line. He goes out every day at 7:00 p.m. and comes home at one in the morning. We get up around eleven, eat breakfast while reading the paper with MTV playing in the background, then take Justine for a walk in the park; when we get back home, we have sex until five in the afternoon. We've taken to being two guys as far as we can. Two gay guys, except for the fact that we don't have a penny, or regular jobs, or a house; we've got nothing, neither back-rooms nor dicks; but there are more dildos where we live than there are cocks in the saunas of Paris. During these three months in 2004, the issue of the structural lack of public space for lesbians, drag kings, and trans guys in Paris doesn't bother us\u2014even if it does pose a real problem. We fuck each other all day. As soon as we have a moment free. The process of adapting to silicone can take a long time. At the beginning, I'm the one who fucks him. He has the beauty of an Arab smuggler, the elegance of a rogue who reads Artaud, and the calm of a pharaoh's dog. With black eyes and a freckled face, he's the best thing since sliced bread. His drag king vagina swallows everything. Without regard to size. No need to begin with size M; why not go directly to XL.7. Be ComIng tVictor is an impassable \"bottom.\" He can take every - thing I find. He smiles when he comes and never tires out. Every day, at 5:30 p.m., bus 69 takes him to his work as a linguistic masturbator. When he leaves the house, his skin is hyperoxygenated, but his legs are trembling. He dozes on the bus before arriving at the job, then spends six hours on the phone doing his whore routine. This has been working particularly well since he began to specialize in sadomas - ochistic clients. His arrangements with me in private end up serving to soothe the sexual deprivation of a gang of masturbators who spend the day stuck on the telephone. It's what the Negrists of the radical Left call \"biopolitical work,\" or, in other words, jerking off the planetary cock. It consists of the transformation of our sexual resources into work, of our sensitivity into an object of commerce, of our erotic memory into text paid by character count, of our sexual arrangements into anonymous scenarios performed repetitively by indifferent actors. During the seven hours in which Victor \"works biopolitically,\" I write. Paid by the French state just enough to eat and take care of bills, I've accumulated nearly a thousand pages on the impact of feminism on contemporary aesthetic and politi-cal discourse. The philosopher's minimum wage. Ensconced at my work table like a pilot in his cockpit, with Enrique Morente playing in the background, I read Foucault, Sloter - dijk, or Buckminster Fuller, or write an unpaid article about sexual segregation in public space. It calms me when sex and philosophy approach each other. These are precious hours, enveloped in translucent silence, the peace of iso-lation. A balance composed of two equally drifting masses be coming T 131that achieve equilibrium in my brain; reading flows toward writing, and the other way around. Without anxiety. I'm on the point of finishing Anus Public: An Interview with Nobody, a conversation in which no one asks me the questions that I answer about the reasons that led to my giving up queer politics. I have no intention of publishing this text. I think it's still inadequate, too tender for the brutality of the century, too obviously selfish in the face of the impend-ing collective suffering and the gradual disappearance of the living. Television helps me get away from the island of reading-writing. News from the heterosexual world: i-T\u00e9l\u00e9. P in a leopard shirt and black sunglasses, and BB, looking like a pop Jesuit, discussing the life of Janis Joplin. Obvi-ously, she was a lesbian. At this moment, I don't know that Mr. Leopard Shirt is the person who broke the heart of my future lover. That is what allows me to continue to lead a normal life, in an automatic way, without concern. When Victor comes home, I get ready for dinner. Sometimes there's enough energy left for us to fuck for thirty or forty minutes. Or else we fuck only with our mouths, endless fucks, emitting electric signals received everywhere else in the body. Sometimes we fall asleep immediately after hav - ing dined with Justine. These months form a long tunnel of sex, drag king days, tantric rituals, soft-packing, days of incest and vampiric sleep that I go through in a semicon-scious state, with the certainty that something or someone will end up taking me out of this infernal paradise. I would have never imagined that VD, your death, and testosterone would be waiting at the end of the tunnel. In this case\u2014and who knows if it was only this one, or more generally the 132 be coming Tcase\u2014complete ignorance of the future was the condition that provided the possibility of continuing to live in the present. Just as it is necessary to forget to keep living, it is necessary not to know the future to wait naively for time to pass. At the height of his career, the architect Adolf Loos burned all his drawings, letters, diaries, fetish objects. He burned everything. With fire, he built an archive made of smoke, a dense mass of forgetfulness from which it would be possible to begin to live again. If there were a precise psy - chosomatic memory of the previous breakup, no one would fall in love again; nor would we if we knew in advance the exact circumstances of the end of the love we were about to begin having. If I'd known that your death, the love of VD, and addiction to T were at the end of the tunnel, then excitement, fear, and an irrepressible desire would have prevented me from living. It seems that not having cer - tainty, not knowing, can be confirmed as a condition of bio-political survival. In the meantime, I enjoy what I have. The unique plea- sure of writing in English, French, Spanish, of wandering from one language to another like being in transit between masculinity, femininity, and transsexuality. The pleasure of multiplicity. Three artificial languages, expanding as they become entangled, fight to become or not become a single language. Blend. Finding their meaning only in this blend-ing. Production among species. I write about what matters most to me, in a language that doesn't belong to me. This is what Derrida called the monolingualism of the other; 1 none of the languages that I am speaking belong to me, and yet 1. Jacques Derrida, Le Monolinguisme de l'autre, Ou Galil\u00e9e, 1996).be coming T 133there is no other way to speak, no other way to love. None of the sexes that I embody possess any ontological density, and yet there is no other way of being a body. Dispossessed from the start. sTaT e-C O u C h- bO dy-M O le C ule During the two months before your death I wake up con-sistently every night at four in the morning, the hour when cows give birth and the owls go hunting. The history of life is revealed before me night after night with the slowness of insomnia. It calms me to think that I was once bacteria and that someday I'll become it again. My bacterial self helps me sleep. For more than two thousand years, it rained on earth until these empty pools that had become oceans and evaporated after the explosion of a giant meteorite filled up with water again. I tell myself that if the oceans could dry up and then refill, my heart as well can purge itself of poli-tics and be filled again. What I don't know yet is that soon my heart will be filled with your death and, almost at the same time, VD's love. During the day, I swing between frenetic activity and total emptiness. In the periods of emptiness, I spend the majority of my time sitting on the couch. I don't search for a comfortable position, try to make it an elegant gesture; I merely flop shapelessly on the rectangular surface of the couch, and wait. During these recumbent hours, I sweat, tremble; sometimes, but rarely, I cry, and from time to time, I manage to fall asleep. I go out only to walk Justine. 134 be coming TBuy the paper, but don't read it. Buy something to eat, but don't eat it. The dog eats, though. This couch could be a bed in a psychiatric hospital. Yes, that's it, a home office for the medical and legal institutions of the Republic of France, a country in which I'm not even a citizen. The couch is a tentacle of the control system, an installation within inner space in the form of living room furniture. It's a political device, a public space of surveillance and deactivation that presents an advantage in comparison with other classical institutions, such as the prison or the hospital. Its purpose is to uphold the fiction that this apartment, its fifty-five square feet, which can be locked with a key, is my pri-vate territory. A slippage of paranoia from the sofa to my skin. My body could be a lifelong center of imprisonment, a mechanism that is conscious of the system of control implanted in my biological structure, an avatar of pharma-copower with my name attached to it. My body, my cells are a political appliance par excellence, a public-private space of surveillance and activation that affords an advantage com-pared with other classical institutions such as the school or army and that upholds the fiction of my subjectivity and its biochemical support, its cells, its supposedly impenetrable fifty-five square feet as my unique and ultimate individual possession. I stop the paranoia and kiss Justine. How can I escape form this cozy prison? What can I know? What am I supposed to do? What am I allowed to hope for? I look for keys to survival in books. I cling to Foucault's published seminars, Guattari's Trois ecologies , the biography Violette Leduc, Genet, Haraway, Wittig again, Susan Stryker, Edmund be coming T 135White. But, more than anything, there are your books. I don't think about calling you when I'm at my worst. From time to time, you leave a belligerent message on my answer - ing machine. \"When are you going to write something that's worth the trouble?\" \"It's you or me.\" \"Stop attacking me.\" I don't answer. Ever. I don't understand what you're talking to me about. I don't know what to say to you. If you only knew what was happening to me. But you don't have the slightest idea. Your stupid messages calm me down because they allow me to dodge the question: I don't call you so that I don't have to tell you that I'm going to start taking testos - terone. I should speak to you about it, inform you of it. Now that I'm going to transform myself into one of yours, we'll be able to fulfill the old dream of fucking each other. I don't know that these days are the last before your death, and I don't call you. I spend entire days reviewing the archive of American feminism in the 1970s. Certain voices are engraved perma-nently in my memory. Others are disappearing for good. Faith Ringgold remains, as does her way of saying eye to eye to a journalist that the only way to survive the colonial and patriarchal enemy is to laugh in his face. She's not kidding; on the contrary, she's shouting right at him, interrupts him when he speaks, doesn't pay him the slightest attention. Laughter is a form of resistance, survival, a way of muster - ing forces. Shouting, too. When you belong to an oppressed group, you have to learn how to laugh in the face of the enemy, says Ringgold. The problem is that things aren't so clear anymore. You end up not knowing anymore who's the oppressor and who's the oppressed; or rather, it's difficult 136 be coming Tto see yourself as both the oppressor and the one who is oppressed. I guess that in that case you have to laugh at yourself. Jill Johnston's voice is imprinted in me: \"As long as all women aren't lesbians, there will be no political revolu-tion.\" Nancy Angelo and Candace Compton: \"Listen closely. You don't believe that I'm going to end my life within these four walls? No one can force me to. Listen to me. I've had it up to here with living locked inside my body. I'm sick of it.\" My mind is a sexual sheath in which my body is huddled, a shut case, a tomb, a trap. I'm a fascist political message that is drifting. My body is the message, my mind the bottle. Exploding. It's the only thing that makes me get hard. Every day, I try to cut one of the wires attaching me to the cultural program of feminization in which I grew up, but femininity sticks to me like a greasy hand. Like my mother's warm hand, like the oceanic sound of Spanish in my dreams. Like Faith Wilding in her performance in the Womanhouse project, I keep waiting to be taken into some- one's arms, waiting for life to begin, waiting to be loved, for pleasure to arrive, waiting . . . But I'm also a trans man. With or without T. To the list of feminine waiting, I must add the endless list of ways of hoping for the advent of mas - culinity: waiting for my beard to grow, waiting to be able to shave, waiting for a cock to grow from my loins, waiting for girls to look at me as if I were a man, waiting for men to speak to me as if I were one of them, waiting to be able to give it to all the little sweeties, waiting for power, wait - ing for recognition, waiting for pleasure, waiting . . . I won-der when it will be too late to undo this program of gender be coming T 137production. Maybe beyond a certain threshold, the process becomes irreversible. What are the temporal parameters of this production? What are the contours of its construction; what is its direction? In her 1967 SCUM Manifesto, Valerie Solanas had seen things with a certain precision. 2 More than forty years have gone by, and one element seems to have changed: all the grotesque characteristics that Solanas attributes to men in capitalist society at mid-twentieth century seem to have spread to women today. Men and women are the bioprod-ucts of a bifurcated sexual system with a paradoxical ten-dency for reproduction and self-destruction. \"To be male is to be deficient, emotionally limited . . . egocentric, trapped inside himself, incapable of empathizing or identifying with others, of love, friendship, affection, of tenderness.\" Men and women are isolated units, creatures condemned to constant self-surveillance and self-control by a rigid class-sex-gender-race system. The time they devote to this brutal political arrangement of their subjectivity is comparable to the whole extent of their lives. Once all their vitality has been put to work to reduce their own somatic multiplicity, they become physically weakened beings, incapable of find-ing any satisfaction in life and dead politically before they have taken their last breath. I do not want the female gen-der that has been assigned to me at birth. Neither do I want the male gender that transsexual medicine can furnish and that the state will award me if I behave in the right way. I don't want any of it. 2.

I'm taking not only the hormone, the molecule, but also the concept of hormone, a series of signs, texts, and discourses, the pro-cess through which the hormone came to be synthesized, the technical sequences that produce it in the laboratory. I inject a crystalline, oil-soluble steroid carbon chain of molecules, and with it a bit of the history of modernity. I administer myself a series of economic transactions, a col-lection of pharmaceutical decisions, clinical tests, focus groups, and business management techniques; I connect to a baroque network of exchange and to economic and politi-cal flow-chains for the patenting of the living. I am linked by T to electricity, to genetic research projects, to megaur - banization, to the destruction of forests of the biosphere, to the pharmaceutical exploitation of living species, to Dolly the cloned sheep, to the advance of the Ebola virus, to HIV mutation, to antipersonnel mines and the broadband trans - mission of information. In this way I become one of the somatic connectives through which power, desire, release, submission, capital, rubbish, and rebellion circulate. As a body\u2014and this is the only important thing about being a subject-body, a technoliving system\u2014I'm the plat - form that makes possible the materialization of political imagination.

Instantly, the testos - terone turns me into something radically different from a cis-female. Even when the changes generated by this mol-ecule are socially imperceptible.

All drugs are poisons. The only difference between a poison and a medi-cine lies in the dose. But what is the right dose of testoster - one? The one that yields my body, or another? What would hormonal justice be? And if there is a hormonal justice, should I apply that justice to myself? Testosterone is the devil in a colorless gel.

The changes are not purely artificial. Testosterone existing externally is inserted into a molecular field of possibilities that already exist inside my body. Rather than rejection of it, there is assimi-lation, incorporation. Mit-sein . Being-with-testosterone. Testosterone does not radically alter the perception of reality or the sense of identity. This particular dose of tes - tosterone isn't strong enough to produce in the body of a cis-female identifiable exterior changes labeled as \"viril-ism\" by mainstream medicine (beard and mustache, notice-able increase in muscle mass, changing of the voice . . . ). It does not change the way others decipher my gender. I've always had an androgynous body, and the microdoses of testosterone that I'm giving myself don't alter that situa-tion. However, they produce subtle but decisive changes in my affect, in my inner perception, in my sexual excitation, in the odor of my body, and in resistance to fatigue. Testosterone isn't masculinity. Nothing allows us to conclude that the effects produced by testosterone are mas - culine. The only thing that we can say is that, until now, they have as a whole been the exclusive property of cis-males. Masculinity is only one of the possible political (and nonbiological) by-products of the administration of testos - terone. It is neither the only one nor, over the long term, the one that will dominate socially. The consumption of testosterone, like that of estrogen and progesterone in the case of the Pill, do not depend on be coming T 141any ideal cultural constructions of gender that would come to influence the way we act and think. We are confronted directly by the production of the materiality of gender. Everything is a matter of doses, of melting and crystal-lization points, of the rotary power of the molecule, of regularity, of milligrams, of form and mode of administra-tion, of habit, of praxis. What is happening to me could be described in terms of a \"molecular revolution.\" In detailing this concept in order to refer to the revolt of May 1968, F\u00e9lix Guattari certainly was not thinking of cis-females who self-administer testosterone. On the other hand, he was attentive to structural modifications generated by micropolitical changes such as the consumption of drugs, changes in perception, in sexual conduct, in the invention of new languages. 3 It is a question of becomings, of mul- tiplicities. In such a context, molecular revolution could be pointing to a kind of political homeopathy of gender. It's not a matter of going from woman to man, from man to woman, but of contaminating the molecular bases of the production of sexual difference, with the understand-ing that these two states of being, male and female, exist only as \"political fictions,\" as somatic effects of the techni-cal process of normalization. It's a matter of intervening intentionally in this process of production in order to end up with viable forms of incorporated gender, to produce a 3.

T is only a threshold, a molecular door, a becoming between multiplicities. For a body accustomed to regulating its hormonal metabolism in terms of the production of estrogen, the intentional increasing of the level of testosterone in the blood constitutes an endocrinal reprogramming. The slight - est hormonal change affects all the functions of the body: the desire to eat and to fuck, circulation and the absorption of minerals, the biological rhythms regulating sleep, the capacity for physical exertion, muscular tone, metabolism, the sense of smell and taste\u2014in fact, the entire biochemi-cal physiology of the organism. None of these modifica-tions can be qualified as masculine. But of all the mental and physical effects caused by self-intoxication based on testosterone in gel form, the feeling of transgressing lim-its of gender that have been socially imposed on me was without a doubt the most intense. The new metabolism of testosterone in my body wouldn't be effective in terms of masculinization without the previous existence of a politi-cal agenda that interprets these changes as an integral part of a desire\u2014controlled by the pharmacopornographic order\u2014for sex change. Without this desire, without the project of being in transit from one fiction of sex to another, taking testosterone would never be anything but a molecu-lar becoming.be coming T 143144Pharmacia (Pharmakeia ) is also a common noun signify - ing the administration of the pharmakon , the drug: the medicine and/or poison. . . .

In order to understand how new relationships of body-power, pleasure-knowledge, and pharmakon -subjectivities were established in the West, we must first make an indispens - able detour through the relationship between capitalism and the destruction of our entheogenic 2 traditions. To gain access to the question of the pharmakon , we have to go the way of witches. Farmers, harvesters, and prepar - ers of medicinal plants were condemned during the Inqui-sition. Witches, alchemists, and midwives were declared to be heretics and satanic deviants. At the same time, Europe colonized the Americas. \"Witch-hunt[s] occurred simul-taneously with the colonization and extermination of the populations of the New World, the English enclosures, [or] the beginning of the slave trade.\" 3 Feminist historian Sil- via Federici has shown that the witch hunt was a double 2.

Pharmacopower 145attempt to appropriate women's bodies as reproductive force and to end the use of natural resources as \"commons\" (meadows, forests, rivers, lakes, wild pastures). The process of enclosing land, expropriating folk wisdom, criminaliz - ing practices of \"voluntary intoxication,\" and privatizing plant germ plasm was only beginning. It reached its apex in the modern period with the colonial expropriation of plants, animals, human bodies, and knowledges; the per - secution of the producers, consumers, and traffickers of \"drugs\"; the gradual transformation of natural resources into pharmaceutical patents; and the confiscation by jurid-ical-medical institutions of all experiments that involved self-administration. 4 Most medieval preparations with hallucinogenic proper - ties were topically absorbed, dissolved in an oil-based oint - ment and smeared on the neck, armpits, or stomach. The way these salves were applied closely resembles transgen-der people's use of testosterone in gel form today. Contem-porary historians of medieval pharmacological traditions and the Inquisition hypothesize that most of the visions and acts of magic condemned as satanic by the tribunals of the Inquisition were the result of the accidental or inten-tional ingestion of psychoactive substances. By consulting the records of the inquisitors of the period and the ancient treatises of herbalists, today's researchers have been able to identify the different hallucinogenic and narcotic sub-stances extracted from vegetable and animal matter that were then in use. 4. Richard Stallman, \"Biopirates ou biocorsaires?,\" Multitudes 1 (mars concoc - tions mention psychoactive solanaceous ingredients, substances such as henbane (of the nightshade family), stramonium (thorn apple), belladonna, and mandrake. All of them included extracts of such plants as the poppy (source of opium, heroin, and morphine) and hemp (mari-juana, hashish); toads, whose skin, we now know, con-tains a strong psychotropic substance; and a certain kind of \"flour of damp cereals,\" probably having to do with the ergot fungus that attacks rye and from which LSD would be extracted. Hallucinogenic visions worthy of the rheto-ric of Deleuze and Guattari (becoming animal, becoming a plant, having sexual relations with animals, talking with trees, astral projection, etc.) could have been caused by the psychotropic effects on the organism after the ingestion or cutaneous application of these plants with hallucinogenic or aphrodisiac powers. In the 1960s, Walter Pahnke scru-pulously followed the formula for an ointment appearing in a fifteenth-century book and then experimented, along with other colleagues, by smearing it on the area of the neck and armpits. All the researchers reported having been plunged into \"a twenty-four-hour sleep during which they dreamed of daredevil flights, frenetic dancing and other strange adventures similar to those that took place during medieval orgies.\" 5 During periods of drought and severe food shortages, to increase the production of bread, substitute grains like rye were used, and these might have contained mycotox - 5.

Today we know that the vic - tims of Ignis Sacer (Saint Anthony's fire) were suffering from the effects of the hallucinogen lysergic acid diethyl-amide (abbreviated after 1938 as LSD)\u2014a mycotoxin that appeared during the baking of bread contaminated with ergot\u2014as well as from other mycotoxins, such as bella-donna alkaloids, extracted from the fruit of the mandrake root. Several more centuries were necessary before some of these mycotoxins would appear again, in the manufacture of antibiotics. 6 The transcript of the sentencing of a woman accused of witchcraft during the Inquisition in Carcassonne, from 1330 to 1340 (the period in which the term witch's Sabbath first came into use), records, \"She encountered and greeted a gigantic goat to which she gave herself. In exchange, the goat taught her about venomous plants cooked in a cal-dron over an evil fire, and poisonous plants. . . . Since that time, she has devoted herself to the preparation of certain noxious ingredients and potions.\" 7 The 1580 treatise De la d\u00e9monomanie des sorciers by Bodino established a criminal relationship between herbcraft and witchcraft.8 That was how herbalists, bonesetters, bards, and dru- ids and priests and priestesses of other faiths, including all those who dared practice herbcraft (for therapeutic, ritu- 6.

The feminist activist and pagan witch Starhawk argues that the persecution of witches in Europe (and eventually in the American colonies) from 1430 to 1740 was part of a larger process of eradicating knowledge and lower-class power while simultaneously working to reinforce the hege-monic knowledge of the expert, something indispensable to the gradual insertion of capitalism on a global scale. 9 The Malleus Maleficarum , a handbook for the Inquisition and its techniques for extracting knowledge, condemns female sexuality, nonproductive sexuality (anal practices and masturbation), and all experimentation with psycho-active substances. 10 As Starhawk points out, the Inquisi- tion punished aggressiveness and pleasure in women and imposed passivity, submission, and silence on them in the domain of sexual practices. 11 All of it was connected: the emergence of proto-industrial capitalism and its scien-tific forms of production and transmission of knowledge; the extermination of a part of the population that had 9.

Contrary to the generally accepted idea, women did not wait until the twentieth century to become part of the labor market. Their practice of fields of knowledge and their pro-duction of wealth were carefully ousted from the circuits of medieval economy so that such exclusion would strengthen early capitalism. Angela Davis has taught us that the \"white woman\" as mother and housewife is an invention of mod-ern capitalism: the creation of bourgeois concepts of wife and reproductive mother are accompanied by the economic devaluation of the household and the exclusion of house-work from the productive sphere. 12 Starhawk finds a correlation between this economic analysis and the criminalization of witchcraft: The Witch persecutions were tied to another of the far- reaching changes in consciousness that occurred during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The rise of pro-fessionalism in many arenas of life meant that activities and services that people had always performed for them-selves or for their neighbors and families were taken over by a body of paid experts, who were licensed or otherwise recognized as being the guardians of an officially approved and restricted body of knowledge. 12. Angela Y. Davis, Women, Race, & Class (New York: Vintage, 1983), 8-12.150 P harmacopowerThe Catholic Church had for centuries served as a model for an approved body that dispensed approved grace. Many of the charges against Witches and heretics can be seen as charges of giving or receiving \"Brand X\" grace, one that lacked the official seal of approval; of transmitting knowledge without approval. Witches' powers, whether used for harming or for healing, were branded as evil because they came from an unapproved source. 13 During the medieval period, women were in charge of caring for and healing the body by employing traditional forms of knowledge that were based on the use of herbs in the context of ritualistic practice. Female caregivers, whether scholars or midwives, represented a threat to the professional orders, at the center of which were the new information experts, who would soon be legitimized as scientific, and who included those in the field of medi-cine. Such members of these orders would organize to form guilds at the beginning of the sixteenth century. Licenses to regulate the exercise of the medical profession were cre-ated. These excluded white women and nonwhite people of all genders who were learned in pharmacology. At the end of the Middle Ages, the drainage of lakes and swamps, the cutting of forests, the fencing of land, the institution of private property for farming and cattle rais - ing worked simultaneously to crush the pagan community, where the mythical forces of the popular imagination and the ecosystem were located, and in which grew those plants and substances used in the \"art of witchcraft.\" From this 13. Starhawk, Dreaming, 199. Pharmacopower 151perspective, the persecution of witches can be interpreted as a war between expert knowledge and the non-profes - sional knowledge of the multitude, a war between white patriarchal power and narcosexual knowledge as it was tra-ditionally practiced by women, colonized peoples, and non-authorized sorcerers. It became a matter of exterminating or confiscating a certain ecology of body and soul, hallu-cinogenic treatments, and forms of pleasure or excitation. Modern colonial capitalist knowledge came to pathologize those technologies of subjectification produced by the col-lective and physical experience of rituals, the process of the transmission of symbols, and the absorption of any halluci-nogenic or sexually arousing substances. Using the accusa-tion of heresy and apostasy (denial of God), witch hunts did nothing more than conceal the criminalization of practices of \"voluntary intoxication\" and sexual and hallucinogenic self-experimentation. It was on this forced oversight that electrical and hormonal modernity would be erected. sOM aT i C Fi CT i O ns: The i n V en T i O n OF s ex hO r MO nes The sweet ferment of subjectivity eating away at itself. \u2014Peter sLo ter Di J k14 Everything we are today, our way of comprehending our - selves as free, individual, and desiring bodies, begins with printing, the Industrial Revolution, magnetism and its transformation into electricity, rapid transport, long- 14.

It also begins with the dis - placement of millions of non-white human bodies from Africa to Europe and America as labor and as a reproductive force for capitalism, but also as bodies used to produce plea-sure and wealth. It also includes the commercialization of white male bodies as prostheses of wage-earning industrial work; the transformation of the white female body into a reproductive, domestic being; and the changing of the sur - face of the planet into a single, endless railway . . . In this context dominated by communication, travel, trade, con-nection, and distribution, it isn't surprising that a grow - ing interest in the circulation of fluids and transmission of information inside the body came to the fore, to create conditions for the invention of hormones as communicat - ing secretions. From the beginning of the twentieth century to the cur - rent day, the processes of the imagining and conceptual-izing of hormones, as well as their production techniques, have been carried out using animals and then human guinea pigs, usually coming from the disciplinary institutions to which they had been sent (army, jail, psychiatric hospital, school . . . ) or from colonized territories regulated by a new articulation of sovereign (necropolitical) and biopo-litical techniques. 15 Bodies of rats, rabbits, chickens, bulls, pigs; models for are not only conceptual categories but also embodied somato-political 15.

Pharmacopower 153fictions\u2014were manufactured at the crossroads at which human, the supposedly nonhuman, and animal meet. Such a process obviously suggests a complex feedback relation-ship: human and animal are, as Donna J. Haraway has argued, the technobiocultural results of these practices of discursive materialization, which unite and separate them with the same movement.Once again, this traffic begins in the biological laboratories. In 1767, the surgeon John Hunter, brother of the famous anatomist William Hunter, performed the auto-graft tissue transplantation of gonads onto castrated rats, and experimented with the heterograft transplantation of cocks' testicles into the abdominal cavity of hens, which led to his establishing for the first time a relationship between testicles and masculinity. 16 A century later, Arnold Adolf Berthold, a physiologist at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, engaged in a series of experiments on roosters, removing their testicles and transplanting them onto another place on the body. His treatise, which was published during a period when the notions of \"heterosexuality\" and \"homo-sexuality\" were being invented as clinical concepts, would be one of the first to resort to the heterosexual rhetoric of male superiority and the complementary nature of the sexes, as an explanation for variations in internal secre-tions. 17 What interests me about this\u2014aside from the heteroscientific caricature created by Berthold's seeing the 16. Jan Bondeson, A Cabinet of Medical Curiosities (London: I.B. Tauris, London, 1997), 187. 17. This treatise on anatomy and physiology by Berthold has been abundantly analyzed by such contemporary female readers as Nelly Oudshoorn and Anne Fausto-Sterling, who have underlined the use of gender metaphors within biological narratives. Numerous accounts and critiques of the cultural history of scientific technical practices that led to the invention of hormones as pharmacological artifacts are also available. See Anne Fausto-154 P harmacopowerroosters given testicles \"as warriors sent out in pursuit of the hens\" and castrated capons as \"languid and peace-loving\"\u2014is the way in which an internal secretion is inter - preted for the first time as distributed information. His treatise concludes with the necessary condition of a chemi-cal, rather than neuronal, transmission of the information contained in the testicles, since these secretions seem to circulate through the entire body by means of the blood-stream and are not dependent on the location at which the testicles were reimplanted. Toward the end of the nineteenth century, it seemed probable that the \"internal secretions\" of certain organs were the origins of physiological processes in different parts of the body. 18 Charles-Edouard Brown-S\u00e9quard, the founder of \"organotherapy,\" focused on the sex glands and decided to employ \"animal organ extracts\" to therapeu-tic ends. Extracts from testicles, thought Brown-S\u00e9quard, could guarantee eternal youthfulness and vigor for men. Similarly, potions containing extracts of guinea pigs' ova-ries were used to treat various forms of uterine disease, as well as cases of hysteria. 19 However, the unusual thing about Brown-S\u00e9quard, which would place him at the edge of the scientific conventions of the time, is his penchant for self-experimentation and public claims regarding such processes, the way in which he becomes fascinated by the Sterling, Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality (New York: Basic Books, 2000); Nelly Oudshoorn, Beyond the Natural Body: an Archeology of Sex Hormones (New York: Routledge, 1994).

The science historian Chandak Sengoopta reports that in 1889 Brown-S\u00e9quard \"nearly ruined his hard-won repu-tation by declaring before an assembly of august scientists in Paris that he had 'rejuvenated' himself by injections of testicular extracts of dogs and guinea pigs.\" 20 The results, he proclaimed, were \"spectacular\": a marked gain in vigor and mental lucidity. In addition, he maintained that the female patients to whom he had administered preparations of ground guinea pig ovaries had also experienced physi-cal and mental improvements. Although several doctors reacted to these affirmations with skepticism, organother - apy would become enormously popular. \"Within a decade, however, the new treatments fell into disrepute. Brown-S\u00e9quard admitted that the effects of his testicular injec - tions were short-lived, probably the result of the power of suggestion.\" 21 Brown-S\u00e9quard's failed experiment would, however, contribute to the elaboration of a theory on the long-dis - tance transmission of bio-information, in which secretions would for the first time be understood as resembling \"chem-ical messages.\" 22 A few years later, Edward Sch\u00e4fer, a profes - sor of physiology at London University College, measured the effects of injecting adrenal, thyroid, pancreas, and liver extracts into the bloodstream. Sch\u00e4fer recorded, \"Every part of the body does, in fact, take up materials from the 20. Sengoopta, 36-37. See also, Anne Fausto-Sterling, Sexing the Body, 182. 21.

Hav - ing thus transformed them, they are ultimately returned into the circulating fluids and in that sense every tissue and organ of the body furnishes an internal secretion.\" 23 The year is 1905. Freud writes his Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality, and Dr. Ernest Henry Starling and Wil-liam Bayliss invent the concept of the hormone. While Freud is imagining an invisible geography that he calls \"the unconscious\"\u2014a virtual space that is both deep within and parallel to the body and in which desire, the affects, and the sexual identity of the subject are at play\u2014science, emerging biotechnology, and disciplinary institutions are taking on subjectivity and sexuality and transforming them into biochemical nodes of technical management. While Freud is inventing sexuality as an entity independent of anatomical sex, Starling and Bayliss are studying human reactions as if they were the effects of substances released from different parts of the body. Their breakthrough was the identification of what they called \"secretin,\" a substance produced by the duodenum that stimulated pancreatic secretion. 24 Secretin will become the paradigm for a new kind of physical functioning that they name hormone , from the Greek horman , which means to excite, or activate, and which worked, independently from the nervous system, as a chemical messenger . As a historian of medicine has noted, \"The middle of the nineteenth century finds an awareness of glands that had no ducts, glands that communicated 23. E.A.

Within a European colonial and industrial capitalist context defined by the practices of telecommunication, travel, traffic, and exchange, Starling and Bayliss are con-ceptualizing hormones according to an early form of infor - mation theory: \"These chemical messages, or hormones, as they could be called, have to be carried from the organ where they are produced to the organ which they affect by means of the bloodstream and the continually physiologi-cal needs of the organism must determine their repeated production and circulation throughout the body.\" 26 The invention of the notion of \"hormone\" represents an episte-mological break, not only in relation to the modern model of the mechanical body, but also in relation to the emerging psychological model of the sexual unconscious. Whereas Freud is conceptualizing the subject as an archeological ter - rain of invisible signs, the hidden strata of which have to be revealed by patient linguistic excavation, Starling and Bayliss are sketching a diagram of the modern individual as a silent biochemical communication network, a complex interlacing of densely connected circuits that emit, receive, and decode biochemical information. In opposition both to Descartes's and La Mettrie's mechanical body, and to the Freudian archeology of the ego, appears a new hormonal, electrochemical, media-related, and ultraconnected sub- 25.

The modern biopolitical body, as Foucault suggested, is no longer a one-dimensional surface where power, law, and punishment come to be inscribed, but rather a thick interi-ority where life, but also political control, take place in the form of exchange, traffic, and communication. 27 If biopower has to go into and through the body (passer \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur du corps ), the space of the body must be extended, inflated, opened up, and magnified to become a communication system. In 1904, Maurice Adolphe Limon gave the name endocrinology to the science of internal secretions, defining interiority (endo means \"inside\" or \"within\" in Greek) as a space of intense, yet invisible, chemical traffic. Between 1860 and 1910, the fifty-year period during which the concept of hormone is being elaborated, James Clerk Maxwell announces the existence of radio waves and Heinrich Rudolph Hertz demonstrates that rapid varia-tions of electric currents can be projected into space in the form of waves that resemble those of light or heat, and 27.

Hormonal theory represents another form of mass communication\u2014an attempt to conceptualize the body as a system of biocommunication. Endocrinology can be read as the biologization of a theory of broadcasting, distribution, and treatment of information\u2014in a world gradually undergoing globalization. For Starling and Bayl-iss, hormones are characterized by their capacity for invis - ible action from a distance: \"a substance which has to be turned out into the blood at repeated intervals to produce in some distant organ or organs a physiological response proportional to the dose.\" 28 Starling described hormones as \"carriers\" of \"chemical messages transported by blood from the organ where they are produced to the organ where they must act.\" 29 The hormone, then, operates according to a logic of tele-action: the capacity to modify an organ by the emission of biocoded information from some distance away. Conceptualized as a tele-transmitter, the hormone implies transport, distribution, exportation, availability for extradomestic use, outflow, escape, flight, exodus, and exchange; but also reading, decodification, and transla-tion. Similar to the process of writing in Derrida's decon-struction, Starling's and Bayliss's hormone is a biological postcard, a chemical telephone message, a long-distance biocall. 30 It confronts us with a new way of understanding 28.

The tele-cinematic hormonal theory is a biomedia theory, a theory about a form of communication in which the body is no longer just a means of transmission, distribution, and collection of information, but the mate - rial effect of these semiotechnical exchanges. We have come face to face with a new understanding of space and the body, but also of the production of power and of the subject (both subjugation and subjectification) that, I shall argue, demands a new theory of biopolitics going beyond the one developed by Foucault in Discipline and Punish and the His-tory of Sexuality. What are the specific practices through which power is spatialized according to endocrinological knowledge and techniques? How do these practices dif - fer from the institutional disciplinary architectures of the hospital and the prison that defined, according to Foucault, nineteenth-century biopolitics? The apparatus (dispositif ) of subjectification that we can reconstruct starting with hormonal theory at the beginning of the twentieth century is a collection of institutional and technical networks in which living artifacts are produced, and are given political recognition within a predetermined cultural context. 31 The pharmacopornographic subject will emerge from a techno-scientific-pop apparatus that con- 31. In the pharmacopornographic regime, the difference between \"apparatus\" and human being, as described by Giorgio Agamben, is put into question. On the contrary, the techno- living emerges like an apparatus from a process of techno-political construction; cf. Giorgio Agamben, \"What Is an Apparatus?\" and Other Essays, trans.

Pharmacopower 161nects elements as heterogeneous as slave ships, whale testi- cles, impotent soldiers, penal institutions, pregnant slaves, biochemical texts, and currency. As Nelly Oudshoorn has emphasized, the emergence of sex endocrinology was characterized by a shift from descriptive, morphological approaches to experimental approaches, which created the need for obtaining new research materials. 32 Claiming that sex hormones were produced and stored in the gonads, endocrinologists and pharmaceutical industries fought to obtain large quantities of ovaries and testicles, both animal and human. Looking for a solution to the shortage of glandular extracts, Alan Parkes, an English physiologist, obtained blue whale ovaries with the help of the British Museum. 33 Because whales do not habitually swim near laboratories in the western world, this source was not a structural solution to the problem of scarcity. To gain access to the enormous quantities of required material, scientists had to create new infrastructural arrangements to secure a steady supply of organic matter. The previous arrange-ments in the laboratory and the clinic were no longer suf - ficient. To find access to research materials, laboratory scientists and gynecologists had to leave their laborato-ries and clinics. The most likely places where large quan-tities of ovaries and testes could be obtained were the slaughterhouses. 34 32. Nelly Oudshoorn, Beyond , 67-68. 33. Ibid., 34. similar process of glandular expropiation and industrial- ization was taking place with human animals. Laboratories waited for the execution of men who had received the death penalty in order to collect their testicles. 35 These new scientific and commercial practices estab- lished the first regular trafficking networks of biological materials among gynecologists, laboratory researchers, pharmaceutical industries, prisons, and slaughterhouses. Sex hormones are the result of such traffic. They are this traffic. Each time I give myself a dose of testosterone, I agree to this pact. I kill the blue whale; I cut the throat of the bull at the slaughterhouse; I take the testicles of the prisoner condemned to death. I become the blue whale, the bull, the prisoner. I draft a contract whereby my desire is fed by\u2014and retroactively feeds\u2014global channels that transform living cells into capital. In 1926, this dense trafficking of body fluids, tissues, and organs used in attempts to detect the raw materials that would allow the \"manufacture\" of hormones led two German gynecologists to suggest that the highest hormonal concentration was found in human urine. 36 This waving of a magic wand debunked the idea of the gonads as the organic medium of hormones and achieved a radical modification of those institutional spaces that had until then held power over sex hormone research. The pharmaceutical firms, 35.

The discovery of urine as a reserve of hormones changed power relationships between production groups. Henceforth, gynecological clinics would be first in line for experimental production because it is easy to obtain urine from the bodies of pregnant women. For male urine, the pharmaceutical laboratories turned to nonmedical institutions, places where large concentrations of bioproducer bodies were available: the army, schools, fac - tories, prisons, police stations . . . \"In 1931, the German chemist Adolf Butenandt collected 25,000 liters of urine on the premises of the Berlin police stations. From this method, he was able to isolate 50 mg of a crystalline sub-stance that he called 'androsterone,' thinking that it was the male hormone par excellence. This was the first time such a term had been used.\" 37 The concentration camp (a hybrid of the animal slaughterhouse and the colonial laboratory) would reduce human bodies to biomaterial for research, revealing the inner links between the biopolitical apparatus and necropolitical techniques. 38 The process of isolating hormones allows us to estab- lish a cartography of sexopolitical disciplinary spaces and locate within them the different institutions where fluids and organs were collected and treated as technical enclaves 37. Adolf Butenandt received the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1939.

The trafficking of human fluids devel- oped among the different disciplinary institutions of reclu-sion, which came to share a common system of production of body-capital: the gynecology clinic, hospital, factory, prison, laboratory, pharmaceutical industry, concentration camps . . . A network of power, knowledge, and capital would determine where and how different fluids, tissues, organs, and bodies circulate, creating differences along gender, sex, race, disability, and class lines. Fluids from women's bod-ies would also have to move from a disciplinary space that was difficult to reach (the space of domesticity) to spaces to which the mechanisms of public management are strongly attached (the hospital, the gynecology center) only to return later to the supposedly private space of the home where hormones were distributed on a massive scale in the form of the Pill. Racialized bodies on the paths of slavery or extermination and bodies stigmatized as \"handicapped\" or sexually abnormal would be rapidly inserted into this industrial system of capitalization of the living. A large part of the clinical tests for hormones would therefore be carried out in colonial (for example, the Pill would be mostly tested on Puerto Rico's non-white population) and psychiatric (homosexuals and transsexuals would be declared mentally ill and subjected to violent surgical and hormonal protocols whereas \"disabled\" bodies would be sterilized 39) enclaves, as well as among the pregnant populations of penitentia-Pharmacopower 165ries and other correctional settings, until hormonal tech- nologies could be assimilated by the anonymous masses in domestic spaces and schools. The epistemological model for the study and produc - tion of hormones is built on animal \"sex change,\" even if the actual notion of \"transsexuality\" does not appear until later, with the works of Magnus Hirschfeld, D. O. Caudwell, and Harry Benjamin: \"At the turn of the twentieth century scientists began to search actively for chemical substances in the sex glands using techniques of castration and trans - plantation. In this surgical approach, scientists removed ovaries and testes from animals like rabbits and guinea-pigs, cut them into fragments, and reimplanted them.\" 40 The psychological concept of transsexuality popularized by Benjamin in the 1960s ensues\u2014paradoxically\u2014from this game of cut-and-paste on the bodies of non-human ani-mals, even though the notion of \"psychological sex\" con-flicts with the scientific idea of \"animality.\" After the 1930s, hormonal classification becomes more complex; for the first time, it seems clear that no hormones are specific to one or the other sex, but that all bodies pro-duce both estrogen and testosterone, the difference lying in the variable quantities of this production. Neverthe-less, the terminology and technical use of male and female hormones remains the same: sex hormones are defined as chemical agents of masculinity and femininity, working as \"the missing link between the genetic and the physiological models of sex determination.\" 41 40.

This pharmacological imbalance in the produc - tion of gender changes after 1998 with the discovery of the side effects on the penis of the molecule sildenafil. 44 In 1969, when French feminist activist Fran\u00e7oise d'Eaubonne invented the term phallocracy to refer to the symbolic and political domination of the penis in Western culture, she couldn't have imagined that this same penis would become the object of intense surveillance and that it would quickly find itself at the center of a rise in pharmacopornographic normalization. Between the middle of the twentieth cen-tury, when David O. Caudwell, Harry Benjamin, and John Money experimented with the effects of sex hormones on genital response to excitation, and the beginning of the twenty-first, when the laboratories Pfizer, Bayer, and Lilly, using the names Viagra, Levitra, or Cialis, quarreled over the commercialization of a vasodilator molecule that can prompt a lasting erection, masculinity ceased to be an exclusive preserve of natural privilege and became a domain of capitalization and biopolitical engineering. At 43. Nelly Oudshoorn, The Male Pill: A Biography of a Technology in the Making (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2003), 4. 44.

As a pharma-ceutical product, the sildenafil molecule has enjoyed the fastest takeoff ever recorded for a new drug. 45 The social anxiety and economic speculation that have sprung up around the penis during the first decade of the new mil-lennium are without precedent. Today, instead of using the term phallocracy , it makes more sense to speak of phal - locontrol \u2014referring to that collection of pharmacoporno- graphic mechanisms struggling to design the frontiers of the new technomasculinity. The time of female monopoly over victimization is drawing to a close; we are entering an era in which the technomolecular control of sex, gender, and sexuality will extend to everything and everyone. The twenty-first century will be the century of the production and pharmacopornographic control of masculinity. Viagra and testosterone are currencies of that new molecular production. Hormonal research has been characterized historically by a second biopolitical imbalance: pharmacological inter - est in testicles and male hormone supported the normative representation of men's bodies, associating testosterone from the start with youth, strength, sexual desire, vigor, and vital energy; conversely, research projects on hormones considered to be female were aiming only to control wom-en's sexuality and their capacity for reproduction. Mascu-linity is still produced according to a model of sovereign patriarchal power, whereas femininity is regulated accord-ing to a set of biopolitical techniques intended to control 45. B. Handy, \"The Viagra Craze,\" Time 151 (May 4, 1998): 39. Pharmacopower 169the reproduction of the nation's population in hygienic and eugenic terms, enforcing the reduction of \"deviancy\" understood in terms of class, race, sexuality, sickness, and disability. 46 In both cases, the objective is the normalization and capitalization of the living. On one side, Viagra works as a normative molecular prosthesis that comes to repair the nonerectile male body considered as sperm producer. On the other side, women's bodies are still constructed by the pharmacopornographic regime as a public reproduc - tive system (womb, . understood as \"public goods\" and research materials) at the service of the national interest. There is no universal human body, but a multiplic - ity of gendered, racialized, and sexualized living beings and organic tissues. Within modern capitalism, male and female hormones and organs don't have the same biopoliti-cal value. As Nelly Oudshoorn observes: With the introduction of the concept of sex hormones, scientists explicitly linked women's reproductive func - tions with laboratory practice. The study of women as the Other was thus extended from the clinic to the laboratory and thereby firmly rooted in the heart of life sciences. . . . This asymmetry in the institutionalization of female and male reproductive bodies in medicine prevailed until well into the second half of the twentieth century. It was only in the late 1970s that the scientists and clinicians 46. For a critical reading of biopolitical regulations, see Lennard J.

Davis (New York: Routledge, 1997), 9-28.170 P harmacopowerestablished andrology as a medical specialty devoted to the study and medical treatment of male reproductive bodies. 47 A brief genealogy of surgical practices reveals this bio- political asymmetry. Beginning in 1870, the ablation of ovaries became a standard operation for curing certain \"menstrual disturbances and various mental illnesses ascribed to the ovaries.\" 48 On the other hand, the ablation of testicles was a technique reserved for penal castrations (practiced, for example, in the United States on black sub-jects accused of having raped white women), 49 used for the eugenic treatment (both surgical and chemical) of \"mani-acs\" and the \"mentally retarded\" and for therapy for \"sex - ual psychopaths.\" The biopolitical techniques of castration remained at a distance from the white, male, middle-class heterosexual body; its masculinity, as well as its organic enclaves\u2014testicles and penis\u2014were the embodiment of sovereign power and could not be simply uprooted. 50 At the beginning of the twentieth century, the pharma- ceutical industry became interested for the first time in the production of preparations from ovarian extracts for the treatment of hysteria and infertility in cis-females, as well as testicular extracts of animal origin for the treatment of 47.

During World War I, German laboratories were pioneers in experiments on dogs using derivatives of animal testosterone, but also on human bodies. In the 1930s, the laboratory Schering AG carried out the harvesting and conversion of urine; and after the 1960s, this laboratory would become the leader in the pro-duction and marketing of the contraceptive pill Yasmin. After World War II, infectious diseases in wealthy coun- tries fell behind illnesses related to aging, the management of sexuality, the modification of affect and mind control, and the regulation of reproduction and the body's immune system in highly toxic environments. This is the point at which the production and commercialization of syn-thetic hormones unveil their true pharmacopornographic function. Testosterone bursts onto the sports scene after 1950. John Ziegler's laboratories in Germany produce Dianabol (an oral variant of anabolic steroids that is not very effec - tive because stomach enzymes can destroy testosterone molecules) and Methandrosterolone (the injectable, more effective variant) to supplement the American weightlift - ing team for the Olympic Games. After the 1960s, ana-bolic steroids enter the pharmaceutical market, along with growth hormone, and become the molecular hardware of such well-known users as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Ser - gio Oliva. From then on, all steroids, testosterone, anabol-ics, and so on, will be sold on the medical pharmaceutical market as well as on other markets, open or black. Contem-porary men live in technotesto times. 172 P harmacopowerThe edible pan O p T i CO n During the period when the notion of gender, the H-bomb, silicone breast implants, electric prostheses, the computer, and Formica furnishings begin circulating in Western soci-eties, a pioneering domestic, portable, and consumable nanotechnology of hormonal modification is produced. In 1951, a mistake made by Gregory Pincus at G. D. Searle and Company laboratories leads to the invention of the first contraceptive pill in the form of the molecule noreth-indrone, a synthetic variant of the active molecule proges - terone that can be administered orally. The production of a portable and edible contraceptive pill enables the entrance of synthetic hormones (and therefore endocrinological and governmental birth control techniques) into the domes - tic space, which becomes a consumption/production knot within the pharmacological network. This is part of a larger biopolitical process of the medicalization and pharmaco-logical regulation of domesticity that was already at work earlier in the twentieth century. At the farthest boundary of the same traffic, moving from the domestic to the colony, endocrinological pro - grams for controlling natality and gender production were targeting the racialized body, circulating first within the slavery trade and later within urban segregated spaces, as well as the \"disabled,\" or the \"sexually deviant.\" As we will see, most clinical trials with sexual hormones are done in colonial settings, in psychiatric institutions (where homo-sexual, intersexual, and transsexual bodies, regarded as Pharmacopower 173physical or mentally ill, are submitted to endocrinological and surgical procedures), and in penitentiaries and correc - tional institutions until hormones, produced and designed as consumption goods, end up being absorbed into the everyday American heterosexual domestic space. There is a Pill geography where bodies, fluids, molecules, and capital are produced and distributed. An examination of the economic and technical networks that resulted in the production of the Pill reveals that, while originating with Pincus's project, the Pill was perfected by John Rock within the unexpected framework of experimental research on aiding procreation for sterile white Catholic families. 51 Pincus's and Rock's research projects, although conflicting in relation to their vision of the function of white women in society, shared an understanding of nonwhite and devi-ant subjects as bodies whose reproductive power should be restricted by the state in order to \"reduce hunger, pov - erty, and disease while fostering economic stability.\" 52 The antibaby molecule was intended to be made into a \"simple, cheap, safe contraceptive to be used in poverty-stricken slums, jungles, and among the most ignorant people.\" 53 In the context of an emerging politicization of racial, ethnic, and sexual minorities in the United States, the contracep-tive molecule was thought of as an urban eugenic device and as a method of controlling nonwhite population growth, as 51.

Protocols of research and evaluation of the Pill's techni- cal effectiveness reveal its disciplinary and colonial roots. After the success of the preliminary Boston trials for the Pill in 1954 and 1955, John Rock and Gregory Pincus needed a large-scale human group to test the new molecule in order to receive approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to bring the drug to market. The first large clinical contraceptive pill trials were performed by Searle on several groups of female psychiatric patients at Worcester State Hospital and on male prison inmates in the state of Oregon in 1956-57. The tests were intended to measure the effectiveness of using synthetic oral hormones as a method of birth control in women, and also the effec - tiveness of these substances in controlling and decreasing \"homosexual tendencies\" in men. 54 In fact, the relationship between hormonal research and the Worcester State Hos - pital was crucial for the development of the Pill. Founder and feminist activist Katherine McCormick had decided to invest in research on the Pill in order to fight the hereditary transmission of mental illness. 55 Her husband was diag- nosed with schizophrenia, and since at that time the illness was considered hereditary, she tried to locate a safe way of preventing pregnancy in people suffering from the condi-tion who were potential parents.

Constructed in 1833 following the Thomas S. Kirkbride plan, also known as the \"building as cure\" theory, according to which architecture itself was meant to have a therapeutic effect, the Worcester State Hospital in Massachusetts was one of the most prestigious institutions of its time, well known for having been visited by Freud in 1909 when he traveled to the United States. The Worcester State Hospital was the American version of the modern machine \u00e0 gu\u00e9rir (cure machine), to use the expression coined by Jacques-Ren\u00e9 Tenon in his M\u00e9moires sur les h\u00f4pitaux de Paris (1788), which Michel Foucault used as the key document in his study of the emergence of a new set of techniques of \"pub-lic hygiene\" that came to spatialize the sick body within the modern city. 56 As Foucault argued, after the end of the eighteenth century, the modern hospital and the prison became the paradigmatic architectures of a pervasive medi-calization of social and political space. A visual and spatial machinery to produce knowledge about madness and rea-son, the Worcester Hospital combined prison architecture with large collective rooms and numerous workshops for experimental treatment, such as saunas and rotating chairs 56.

Whereas the architecture and the treatment were still derived from the nineteenth-century disciplinary biopolitical model for understanding madness and therapy, the hospital also introduced within its walls new \"soft\" and molecular techniques invented during the Cold War period. But mental and prison institutions where not ideal settings for testing the Pill. The Worcester and Oregon trials were not enough to obtain approval from the FDA to commercialize the Pill or to test the ability of ordinary women to take the Pill regu-larly outside medical institutions. Since strong anti-birth control laws in Massachusetts and in many other states made it impossible for Searle to conduct the large study of humans required by the FDA, it turned to Puerto Rico, which already had a long history of governmental birth control programs. The pseudocolonial island of Puerto Rico became the most important clinical site for testing the Pill outside the national disciplinary institutions of the asylum and the prison and functioned as a parallel, life-sized bio-political pharmacological laboratory and factory during the late 1950s and early 1960s. During the Cold War period, Puerto Rico would become the United States' biggest phar - macological backyard. The island was the invisible factory behind the Playboy mansion and the white liberated mid-dle-class American housewife. In 1955, American physician Edris Rice-Wray, the medi- cal director of the Puerto Rican Family Planning Asso-ciation, already working with Searle, offered Pincus the possibility of conducting the Pill trials at Rio Piedras, a sub-urb of San Juan where a new housing project had been set Pharmacopower 177up as part of a slum clearance campaign. In the summer of 1955, Pincus visited Puerto Rico and immediately decided that the Rio Piedras housing was the perfect location for a large-population, long-term Pill trial. The general features of legally enforced pharmacologi- cal experimentation in an environment of imposed isola-tion spread from Europe and North America to colonial and postcolonial regions, transforming the design models of their penal and medical institutions. 57 Puerto Rico was a paradigmatic case of transition from the colonial regime to postcolonial economic and political control. At the end of the nineteenth century, the Spanish colonial regime left the island overpopulated and in extreme poverty. After the end of the anticolonial war of 1898, the island became a US ter - ritory. Already in 1917, the Puerto Rican ruling classes and the American government, inspired by neo-Malthusianism ideas, had drawn up the first population control plan for the island. In 1925, in the overpopulated slums of Ponce, Dr. Jos\u00e9 A. Lanause Rol\u00f3n founded the Birth Control League, built on an educational program. 58 These early birth control programs understood sterilization as a safe means of reduc - 57.

In fact, Puerto Rico was not a stranger to forced sterilizations. As early as 1907, the United States had instituted public policy that gave the state the right \"to sterilize unwilling and unwitting people.\" By 1936, there were more than one hundred birth control clinics operating on the island under federal law. As Katherine Krase has argued, in order to \"catalyze economic growth\" and respond to \"depression-era unemployment,\" in 1937 the \"Eugenics Board\" passed Law 136, an event that signified the institutionalization of these population control programs and the legalization of sterilization techniques. \"Both U.S. government funds and contributions from private individuals supported the initiative.\" 59 Laws similar to Law 136 were passed in thirty states. These policies identified the \"insane,\" the \"feeble-minded,\" the \"dependent,\" and the \"diseased\" as incapable of regulating their own reproductive abilities, thereby jus - tifying government-imposed sterilizations. Legitimizing sterilization for certain groups led to further exploitation, as group divisions were made along race, class, and disabil-ity lines. 60 From the beginning of the experimental trials with hormones, the challenge was how to switch from animals 59.

As McCormick infamously said, in stressing the connection between imprisonment and scien-tific control, the key issue was to find a \"cage of ovulating females\": \"Human females are not easy to investigate as are rabbits in cages. The latter can be intensively controlled all the time, whereas the human females leave town at unex - pected times so cannot be examined at a certain period; and they also forget to take the medicine sometimes\u2014in which case the whole experiment has to begin over again, \u2014for scientific accuracy must be maintained or the result - ing data are worthless.\" (emphasis in text) 61 For Pincus, the island of Puerto Rico offered the most accessible and most easily monitored population pool that McCormick could ever want: the island itself was already a hermetic cage. Puerto Rican women were considered to be not only as doc - ile as laboratory animals, but also as poor and uneducated and therefore an exemplary group: if they could follow the regimen involved in taking the Pill, any white Ameri-can woman could do the same. The island of Puerto Rico itself was treated as an extended, nonwhite, female body to which the Pill was administered in terms of what Foucault called \"urban therapeutics.\" 62 As historians of medicine Jordan Goodman, Anthony 61.

As part of a larger mutation from a disciplinary to a pharmacopornographic regime, \"research became 'de-centered' as it became more commercialized, and moved beyond the immediate sphere of the state or state-related agencies and transcended national borders, borne on the wings of multinational cor - porations.\" 65 The birth control programs tested in Puerto Rico clearly show the complicity between national eugenic programs and private pharmacological interests before the war and the transition from the colonial and state model to the postcolonial and neoliberal multinational model of drug production and population control after the 1940s. 63.

Pharmacopower 181From the Colonial brothel to the pharmacopornographic lab In the past few years, several historical essays have devel- oped a postcolonial reading of the relationship between space, prostitution, gender, and race on the island of Puerto Rico. Radost Rangelova has argued that in Puerto Rico, the relationship between gender and space has been histori-cally and socially contingent on colonial domination, the legacy of slavery, and racial purification of the nation. 66 We can conclude from studies by Eileen Su\u00e1rez Findlay, V\u00e1zquez Lazo, and Laura Briggs on the history of prosti-tution in Puerto Rico before World War II that, beginning with the early years of colonization, the island functioned as a pornotopic colonial site and later became a post- and neocolonial site of pharmacological development. 67 Although colonially promoted from the time of Carlos I, prostitution entered the realm of legal, medical, and media discourse during the nineteenth century as female slavery turned into domestic and sex labor. 68 Conforming to the ideas of such European theorists as William Acton and Par - ent Duch\u00e2telet, the management of spaces of prostitution within the island became a medical as well as colonial task that \"enjoined a sharp geographic separation between gente 66.

For Rangelova, the traditional European and North American segregation of spaces according to gender (pri-vate/public, domestic/nondomestic) and sexuality (places for family and places for prostitution) was reorganized in Puerto Rico according to a colonial logic that separated reproductive spaces from prostitutional spaces in terms of race. Black and poor working-class women were often represented as prostitutes, being excluded from the nine-teenth-century autonomist narrative of the \"gran familia of Puerto Rico.\" 70 Kept separate from the \"white\" and the \"mother\" figure, poor nonwhite women were not under - stood as bodies for the reproduction of the nation, but rather as \"deviants\" (elementos divergentes ) to be medically and legally monitored. Poor nonwhite women were first redefined and managed as potential sex workers. The same bodies would later be the object of contraception manage-ment and experimentation, enabling an unexpected trans - formation from colonial brothel to pharmacopornographic laboratory. As was the case for the early theories of Restif de la Bretonne and Parent Duch\u00e2telet regarding the construc - tion of the utopian state-brothel in Europe, Puerto Rico's policies associated disease, delinquency, and the presence Pharmacopower 183of female sexuality within public spaces. But in Puerto Rico, the biopolitical configuration of urban space in the island's principle cities, Ponce and San Juan, was determined by the complex crossing of gender and class categories with colo-nial constructions of race. Thus, nonwhite marginal women were the object of a network of disciplinary institutions; hospitals (where gynecological exams took place twice a week), prisons, and brothels (within \"zones of tolerance\") created a penal closed-circuit network of control intended to remove the black sexual female body from the public space, as well as to regulate the nonwhite female's reproduc - tive system. According to Rangelova, \"Space was the main axis along which women's bodies and the practice of prosti-tution were regulated, restricted and controlled.\" 71 V\u00e1zquez Lazo provides numerous examples of this spatial control developed by the 1890 Reglamento de Higiene P\u00fablica, which divided prostitutes into three main topopolitical cat - egories, depending on the type of house in which they prac - ticed prostitution. 72 Segregation was simultaneously meant to be a preventive, protective, and therapeutic technique. According to this segmentation of space, the residence of prostitutes was not considered \"domestic,\" since it was not to be a site for the reproduction of family and nation, but rather a \"brothel,\" meaning a space that the govern-ment could inspect, control, and govern. This regulation of sexual spaces dismantled the traditional public and pri-vate divisions of the domestic space and reconstructed the nonwhite working class and impoverished domestic space 71.

In Puerto Rico, the colonial and national state brothel was mutating into a pharmacopornographic heterotopia. The racial and sexual zoning of spaces that had occurred previously would provide the ideal site for the testing of contraceptives. The pharmacological industrialization of the domestic In the 1930s, the process of excluding and monitoring nonwhite female sexuality and reproduction in Puerto Rico went from techniques of control used in medical and prison settings into several active eugenics programs, such as Law 136, which for the first time authorized sterilization for other than medical reasons. Between 1933 and 1939, a large network of maternity hospitals and sterilization and birth control clinics were established on the island. A liberal eugenics law, the network of birth control clinics, and the possibility of combining clinical trials with housing devel-opment and inexpensive labor for American companies and pharmacological industries made Puerto Rico the ideal set - ting for the Pill trials, which were the largest series of clini-cal tests ever performed. In 1948, the US government, with the support of the local government under Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn, began \"Opera-tion Bootstrap,\" which aimed to encourage rapid industrial-ization on the island. 73 Puerto Rico offered tax exemptions, 73. For more about gender production, space, and labor transformation in Puerto Rico, see Alice Col\u00f3n Warren, \"The Feminization of Poverty among Women in Puerto Rico and Puerto Rican Women in the Middle Atlantic Region of the United States\" Brown Journal of World Affairs 5, no. 2 (1998): Luz del Alba trabajo en la manufactura,\" in G\u00e9nero Pharmacopower 185low-cost labor, and differential rental rates to encourage US industrial facilities to settle there. As a result, in a few years the island's economy shifted from colonial labor-intense agrarian industries, such as those of tobacco and sugar, to pharmaceutical, chemical, and electronics production. In a period of twenty years, Puerto Rico became the biggest bio-chemical and pharmaceutical laboratory in North America. Access to contraceptive techniques was, in fact, designed as a component of a larger project involving hous - ing, urban modernization, and industrialization on the island. Control of reproduction and modern housing were, according to the American government, the two major forces that could guarantee the improved standard of living in Puerto Rico. The main location for the first contracep-tive trial, begun in 1955, was a G. D. Searle and Company clinic located in El Fanguito (often shown in US documents as El Fangitto, \"the little mud hole\"), the \"worst slum\" on the island, located just outside San Juan. Soon it would be razed in order to build a mass-produced planned commu-nity with \"functionalist, seven-story residential buildings with running water and sunny balconies.\" Mass-produced single-family houses also were built by federal programs in Delano and in other villages: they were low-priced versions of white middle-class American suburban houses, closer to military housing units and the spaces and living conditions of the residential ghettos of the Chicago Black Belt than to y trabajo: La industria de la aguja en Puerto Rico y el Caribe Hisp\u00e1nico, ed.

Nevertheless, as Lara Marks argues, \"Many of these families highly prized their new accommo-dation and were therefore unlikely to move away during the course of the trial. This would make them easy to moni-tor.\" 74 The Pill trials were a biopolitical program of \"mod- ernizing\" life that extended to the transformation of the family house, but also to sexuality and reproduction. With its strict spatial partitioning, the \"modern\" home became the site in which to reproduce the \"American way of life,\" but also a site of reproductive surveillance. The El Fanguito housing program was the \"cage of ovulating females\" that McCormick dreamed of and that Searle needed to trans - form its molecule into a commercial drug. As part of the same urban development, several American pharmacologi-cal companies built factories on the island, transforming the same women who at night were testing the oral contra-ceptives at home into factory workers during the day. In 1956, when the trials were initiated, the pill selected for use was Enovid, Searle's brand name for a synthetic oral progesterone\u2014a white pill that came in an ordinary glass bottle and that women had to take on a regular basis according to a strict timetable: When taking the medication, the women were expected to swallow tablets every day (about one every six or eight hours) between the fifth and twenty-fifth day of their cycle. A number of women also had to inject themselves with the compound or insert it as a vaginal suppository. 74. Lara Marks, \"Parenting the Pill: Early Testing of the Contraceptive Pill,\" in Bodies of Technology , eds. Oudshoorn University, 2000), 157.Pharmacopower 187Each woman had to take her own basal temperature read- ings and vaginal smears on a daily basis. All this data had to be marked on a chart. The women also had to collect urine over a forty-eight-hour period on the seventh and eighth postovulatory days for hormone analysis. Often the only way to collect urine over such a period would have confined women to their homes where they were near a toilet. 75 Given the high rates of illiteracy among women in Rio Pie- dras, compliance with the instructions and data collecting had to be ensured by regular visits from social workers, who moved daily from house to house collecting fluids, record-ing information, and encouraging women's cooperation with the pharmacological regimen\u2014a practice that forced women to stay at home (when not at the factory) so they could be easily contacted by the social workers. The most important difference between the Pill tri- als conducted at Rio Piedras by Searle and previous clini-cal pharmacological trials lay not in the substance but in the space where they were performed: the Pill trials were the first clinical tests to be externalized outside medical and pharmacological institutions and to take place in the domestic environment. It was Edris Rice-Wray, medical director of the trials, together with Rock and Pincus, who decided to use the housing program of El Fanguito as a home setting for the trial. Having the women take the Pill at home not only reduced the institutional cost of the trials but also placed the subjects within the domestic context of 75. Ibid., 161.188 P harmacopowerordinary life, thus extending the scope of the trial outside medical institutions: every private home could potentially become an experimental site. The El Fanguito housing com-plex became an externalized and extended domestic phar - maceutical laboratory. The high doses of progesterone determined by Searle, to ensure that no pregnancies occurred during the trial, rapidly proved that the hormonal oral contraceptive was extremely reliable. By 1958, because a large part of the population participated in the trial, the birth rate in Puerto Rico had begun to decline. In the early 1960s, other pharmacologi-cal companies, such as Synthex (and its ten-milligram pill Orthonovum) and Wyeth Pharmaceutical (Norgestrel and Mestranol) came to the island and extended the trials. 76 Meanwhile, the Pill trials had also moved to other pseudo-colonial locations, such as Haiti, where Dr. Rice-Wray had initiated a new Searle trial as early as 1957, and Mexico, where Syntex launched a new trial for the Norlutin pill. In most cases the strategy was the same: using housing mod-ernization as a way of installing a micropharmaceutical laboratory within the domestic environment. A transversal analysis of geopolitical and institutional spaces, as well as of the racial, sexual, and gender impli-cations of the uses of the first molecules of estrogen and progesterone, extend our definition of the Pill beyond that of being a simple method for managing births to include, also and most important, a new pharmacodomestic tech - 76. As Puerto Rican physician and advocate against eugenics Helen Rodr\u00edguez-Trias has shown, a strong social and political reaction against the Pill trials had started on the island as early in 1964. Apart from the trials, and as a result of the application of Law 136, by 1969, 35 percent of Puerto Rican women had been sterilized.Pharmacopower 189nique for (re-)producing race, a form of neocolonial bio- technological eugenics for controlling the reproduction of the species. 77 From this perspective, the Pill functions as a semiotic-material element (in its incarnations as both mol-ecule and discourse, machine and organic substance) in the hegemonic racial and sexual grammar of Western culture, obsessed, as Donna J. Haraway has argued, by the contami-nation of lineage, the purity of race, the separation of the sexes, and the control of gender. 78 From the time of the Worcester Hospital and the Puerto Rico trials, the Pill has functioned as a technique not only for controlling reproduction but also for producing and controlling gender and race. Although the Pill was an effec - tive form of birth control, the FDA rejected the first version invented by Pincus and Rock in 1951 and tested at Puerto Rico from 1956 on, because the agency's scientific commit - tee felt it threw doubt on the femininity of American women by suppressing their periods altogether. FDA standards led to Searle's production of a second pill, commercialized in 1959, that was equally effective but could, unlike the first, technologically reproduce the rhythms of a natural men-strual cycle, inducing bleeding that created the illusion of a natural cycle's taking place and somehow \"mimicking the normal physiological cycle.\" 79 The Pill forces us to extend 77.

I will call this process biodrag , in reference to the culture and prac - tices of drag, drag queens, and drag kings, and define it as the pharmacopornographic production of somatic fictions of femininity and masculinity. What is being represented and imitated technically by the Pill is already no longer a sartorial code or a physical style, but a biological process: the menstrual cycle. The process of feminization as it is linked to the pro- duction, distribution, and consumption of the Pill reveals that hormones are sexopolitical fictions, technoliving met - aphors that have the capacity to be swallowed and digested, absorbed and incorporated. They are pharmacoporno-graphic artifacts that can create physical formations that become integrated with vaster political organisms such as our medico-legal institutions, the nation-states, or global networks through which capital circulates. paCkaging d is C iplinary a r C hi T e CT ure: d ial pak and T he i n V en T i O n OF T he e dible pan O p T i CO n Following the Puerto Rico trials, in 1957 the FDA approved the use of Searle's Enovid for the treatment of menstrual irregularities and\u2014two years later\u2014for birth control. Nev - ertheless, Puerto Rican women's resistance to following Pharmacopower 191instructions caused Searle to suspect that commercializa- tion for American women could be difficult without phar - macological control. Although highly efficient, the routine of taking hormonal pills seemed almost impossible to con-trol outside the pharmacological housing programs: never before had a pharmacological product depended so much on disciplining the patient in a domestic setting. As we shall see, the invention of a domestic, portable dispenser for the Pill in the early 1960s would answer this need for self-surveillance and discipline. Originally, Enovid was commercialized in two doses, ten milligrams and five milligrams, and like all prescriptions for the Pill at the time, it was filled in a small bottle. Oral contraceptive hormones entered the American middle-class domestic environment in a brown glass container, but without the pedagogical regime of the Rio Piedras phar - macological-housing complex, any mistake in the intake timetable could cause what Enovid was trying to prevent. Instructions for taking the Pill seemed straightforward: the user was supposed to take the first tablet on the fifth day of menstruation, continue with one tablet every day for twenty days, and then stop; she would begin menstruating in two to three days, and on the fifth day of menstruation she was to start another twenty-day cycle of tablets. But the brown bottle in no way aided memorizing or controlling the intake routine. In 1962, Illinois engineer David P . Wagner (whose back- ground was in developing new fasteners for Illinois Tool Works) created an early prototype dispenser for the Pill, three round plastic plates held together by a snap fastener, 192 P harmacopowerto divide his wife's monthly pill supply into daily doses.80 Wagner explained the process of producing the dispenser: \"With just a \u00bc\" electric drill, a fly cutter to be used in the drill, paper, a saw, a staple, pencil, double-faced transpar - ent tape, several drill bits, a snap fastener that I took off a child's toy, and several flat, clear sheets of either acrylic or polycarbonate plastic, I fashioned the first Pill box for pack - aging birth control Pills.\" 81 The bottom plate had the day- of-the-week pattern. The middle plate held twenty wooden \"pills\" and rotated to match the day pill taking would begin. A single hole in the top plate moved over the Pill to dispense it, revealing the day of the week as a reminder of when the pill was taken. 82 Wagner sent the prototype to Searle and to Ortho Phar - maceutical. Searle rejected Wagner's project and in 1963 Ortho Pharmaceutical launched the first DialPak \"memory-aid\" dispenser, designed according to Wagner's model. 83 Reaching the market a few months later, Searle's Enovid E Con-pac and one-milligram Ovulen pill dispensers were also closely inspired by Wagner's distributor. To distinguish itself from Searle's Con-pac, a 1964 Ortho-Novum adver - tisement showed the DialPak 21 dispenser for the oral contraceptive for the first time, highlighting a watchstrap calendar \"to keep key days always at hand.\" 80. In 1994, David P . Wagner donated his collection of prototypes of drug and pill packaging to the Division of Science, Medicine, and Society at the Simithsonian Museum of National History, enabling historian Patricia Peck Gossel to develop a first study of the design process. 81. Patricia Peck Gossel, \"Packaging the Pill,\" in Manifesting Medicine: Bodies and Machines , ed. Robert Bud (London: Taylor & Francis, 1999), 107. 82. Ibid., 106. 83. Neither Searle nor Ortho bought Wagner's patent. Ortho was later legally forced to pay $10,000 to Wagner to compensate for using his prototype.Pharmacopower 193According to historian of medicine Emilia Sanabria, the material aspects of packaging and pharmaceutical transfor - mation are often overlooked when the history of medical techniques is described: In the manipulation which occurs in the pharmaceutical process, liquid, semi-solid and solid pharmaceutical sub-stances are manufactured\u2014or temporarily stabilized\u2014into pharmaceutical \"objects.\" The possibility of effecting this handcrafting is understood to define the effects that these pharmaceutical objects can have, physiologically-speaking, on their \"patients.\" Pharmaceuticals have increasingly been analyzed as objects. This carves out a particular place for pharmaceuticals in the analysis of material things, and of material things in the analysis of pharmaceuticals. Whilst material culture analyses pro-vide elements to theorize drugs as \"things,\" it produces problems when these things are drugs. I argue that the consumable and changeable aspects of these \"things\" are left un-theorized. This problem stems from a common assumption in anthropological analyses of material cul-ture, which tends to take the object for granted. That is to say, the process of object-making is often eclipsed by the object itself. 84 Insisting on the need to pay attention to the medical and social repercussions of pharmacological marketing, historian Patricia Peck Gossel has studied the packaging techniques that were used for the commercialization of the DialPak, the first compliance package of the Pill, pro- 84. Emilia Sanabria, \"The Medicine, an Evanescent Object: Test on the Manufacture and the Consumption of the Pharmaceutical Substances,\" Techniques & Culture 52-53, no. 2-3 (2009): 168-89.194 P harmacopowerduced in 1963.85 According to Gossel, the Pill was not only a political and gender revolution but also a revolution in drug packaging. The Pill is the first pharmaceutical molecule to be produced as a design object. Gossel understands Wagner's design of the Pill packag- ing as a couple's \"problem solving\" process, in which the husband (and designer) aided his wife in managing a com-plex intake time schedule, reinterpreting the bond between husband and wife as a model of the designer-user rela-tionship. 86 For Gossel, the DialPak appears to be the first \"compliance package\" for a prescription drug\u2014one that intended to help the patient to comply with the doctor's orders. 87 For Gossel, the invention of the dispenser for the Pill indicates the emergence of a new model of pharmaceutical design, one that does not rely on the aims of advertising companies aims, but rather on the designer-user relation-ship. Following Gossel's design history, we could argue that the Pill (taking into account the difficulties of the intake schedule) is not only a chemical product (the molecule iso-lated and marketed as edible capsule) but also an individual portable pharmacomechanism, able to discipline the tab-lets' intake. The 1960s Pill, as a social domestic practice and individual hormonal prosthesis, cannot exist without the 85. Gossel, \"Packaging the Pill,\" 105-21.

David Kingery, eds., History from Things: Essays on Material Culture (Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1993). 86. Gossel explains, as if she needed to justify the Wagners' decision for birth control: \"Doris Wagner began taking the Pill after the fourth child, Jane, was born on November 14, 1961, and the Wagners decided that their family was complete,\" Gossel, 195Ortho-Novum DialPak became the second oral contraceptive on the American market in February 1963.

Whereas a single tablet of an oral contraceptive, if separated from the container, would be recognized only by a pharmacist, the distinctive package of the Pill made it the most readily recognizable prescription drug on the mar - ket during the 1960s. Reversing the traditional relationship between content and container, the packaging is the Pill. Wagner's DialPak design resulted from two operations: spatialization of time and camouflage. First, the dispenser spatialized time by making the administration dates visible within the circular box. Like the rotary-dial telephone, the most popular domestic communication appliance of the Cold War years, the circular box established abstract rela-tionships between three systems\u2014holes, numbers, and network stations for the phone, and holes, Pills, and the dates of the menstrual cycle for the DialPak. The dispenser divided duration into successive segments, each of which indicates a specific time. The spatialization of time produces what Foucault called an \"anatomic-chronological scheme of action\" that combines architecture, design, and body movement, transforming the user into an efficient (non-)reproducing machine. 88 According to Wagner, and later to the Searle and the Ortho Pharmaceutical advertising cam-paigns, the dispenser's main aim was to reduce \"forgetful-ness,\" with the dispenser being presented as a prosthesis to women's lack of memory and responsibility. In this respect, the DialPak was a technique for packaging not only pills but 88. Michel Foucault, \"Docile Bodies,\" in Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, trans. Alan Sheridan, 2nd ed. (New York: Vintage, 1995), 156-66. 89. According to the same logic, the IUD contraceptive device was described by TIME magazine as \"memory in plastic.\" See \"Contraception: Freedom from Fear,\" TIME, April 7, 1967, http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,843551,00.html. Pharmacopower 197also memory and time, responsibility and trust.89 The monthly package of pills, with its imperative of daily administration but also the risk of forgetfulness or incorrect management, with its time-based ritual and pop design, evokes a chemical calendar in which each day is indicated by the indispensable presence of a pill. Its presen-tation in circular form invites the user to follow the move-ment of time on a dial, as if on a clock, where the alarm announces the time of ingestion. 90 It functions as a device for the domestic self-surveillance of female sexuality, like a molecular, endocrinological, high-tech mandala, a book of hours, or the daily examination of conscience in Ignatius's Spiritual Exercises . It is a hormonal domestic microprosthe- sis that regulates ovulation, but it also produces the \"mind\" and living body of the heterosexual woman as modern sex - ual reproductive subject. On the other hand, Wagner intended to camouflage a birth control technique as a \"female\" ordinary-use object: he designed the dispenser to be the size and form of a makeup compact, so women could carry it discreetly in their purses\u2014a way of employing in public space a tech-nique that was originally meant for only the domestic space. Although soon used by millions of American women, the dispenser was meant to be totally \"private,\" the per - fect box in which to keep a female secret. 91 This domestic and undisclosed character of a birth control technique may 90. The first packages of pills, designed in the sixties, were equipped with an integrated alarm. 91. Gossel, \"Packaging the Pill,\" 115.

As historian Patricia Peck Gossel recalls: \"A Philadelphia women's health clinic recom-mended that women take their Pill when they heard the theme music for the 11 o'clock news, at bedtime,\" 92 some - thing that amounts to trying to transform a national broad-casting media into a technique to regulate intake. In some cases, \"the package of birth control Pills was presented in a box with a toothbrush, a small bar of soap, a 'Remember Me' sticker for the bathroom mirror and the slogan 'Brush your teeth, wash your face, take your Pill . . . once a day, every day, at the same time.'\" 93 In 1965, Mead Johnson invented the twenty-eight-day regime, adding placebos that enabled the user to take a pill every day. C-Queens sequential pill by Eli Lilly contained two different formulations to be taken in sequence. The package resembled a calendar, with four rows of five tab-lets. The twenty-eight-day regime made the DialPak calen-dar format obsolete; the key now was that the pills be taken in the proper sequence, leaving behind the importance of when the cycle started. But with time, the Pill became a female life-regulator: the Parke and Davis placebo twenty-eight-day regime included one milligram of Norlestrin Fe to \"compensate for mineral loss during menstrual bleeding,\" 92.

Organon, Inc., cited in Gossel, \"Packaging the Pill,\"116. 200 P harmacopowerand some other designs incorporated a dial to remind the user to examine her breast for tumors at the optimum time of her cycle. The process of camouflage, miniaturization, and priva- tization reached a higher level in 1964 when the Population Council's Center for Biomedical Research demonstrated that hormones could be released from a silicone rubber cap-sule implanted in the body. The first clinical trials of a six-capsule Silastic (silicone and plastic) drug delivery system, implanted under the skin of the upper arm, were conducted in 1975, and this system was first approved for use as Nor - plant in Finland in 1983. \"In this case,\" as Patricia Peck Gos - sel noted, \"dosage form and the container have, in a sense, merged.\" 94 The implant remained within the body, invisible, as long as the drug was released, for five years, after which it was surgically removed. The Norplant prosthetic implant would be later followed by infusion pumps, transdermal patches, and osmotic systems. Bringing Emilia Sanabria's and Gossel's conclusions about pharmaceutical packaging further into a general his - tory of biopolitics, I shall argue that the transformation of the oral contraceptive pill into \"the Pill\" through packag-ing can be understood not only as a cultural process that implies social and medical effects but also as the translation of an architectonic model, a disciplinary system of power and knowledge relationships derived from Enlightenment architectures of the hospital and prison, into a domestic 94.

The art historian Aby Warburg has given us an icono- graphic method for thinking about the transmission and survival of forms through different cultural mutations. In his Der Bilderatlas Mnemosyne (The Mnemosyne Atlas, 1924-29), Warburg lays out a possible visual history of Europe, made of two thousand images, among which can be found Roman sculptures, maps from different periods, Darwinian diagrams of animal evolution, Renaissance frescos, Christian oil paintings, and photographs from the beginning of the twentieth century. Inspired by this method of visual traceability, one can recognize, and not without terror, a vestige of Jeremy Bentham's model in the original design for the package of contraceptive pills that was marketed after the 1960s. In their internal divergence, Bentham's architectural motifs reclaim their place at another scale: the contraceptive pill is an edible panopticon. Social orthopedics is mutating into pharmacopornographic micro p rosthetics. DialPak transformed the panopticon into a domestic, portable female hormonal compact.

Coqu\u00e9au and by Louis Le Vau's proj-ect for a menagerie at Versailles, first emerged as a model of industrial (but not yet penal) architecture, developed in 1786 by the philosopher Jeremy Bentham, brother of the naval engineer Samuel Bentham (in fact, it was Samuel who conceived the basic architecture of the building), in response to a commission from the Russian prince Grigory Potemkin. Originally, the panopticon was an industrial \"inspec -202 P harmacopowertion house\" designed to optimize surveillance, control, and worker production in a factory complex. Bentham's archi-tectural structure was based on two concentric rings, with an observation tower at the center of the entire structure and a series of cells radiating out from it. Each of these cells had two windows, an external one to let in light, and an internal one facing the surveillance tower. The occupants of the cells were isolated from each other by walls and sub-jected to the collective and individual (audiovisual) scrutiny of a guard in the tower, which, as Foucault speculates, could have been empty or occupied by the abstract eye of God, which would remain hidden. As pointed out by Christian Laval: The panoptic is not only the eye of power, a kind of imagi- nary figure suspended over a splintered and isolated peo-ple, but also, in the reverse sense, the eye of the people that must remain constantly focused on the ruling class so that the latter won't betray the interests of the great - est number. This double meaning of surveillance is based on the principle of the goal of generalized transparency. The model of the panoptic has the advantage of combin-ing what is usually thought to be distinct and separate: the most intrusive social control, the free market and the most advanced democracy. 95 This original design became the model for internment and disciplinary centers built in the nineteenth and twen- tieth centuries, centers such as Rahway Prison in New Jer - 95.

For Foucault, the panopticon isn't just a simple disciplinary device. It's the material model of disciplinary knowledge-power as a form of \"social orthopedics\": 96 power and its specific modes of knowledge and surveillance mate-rialized in the form of physical architecture (whether of a prison, school, hospital, barracks, or factory) that auto-mates movement, controls the gaze, programs action, and ritualizes everyday bodily practices. In all such cases, disci-plinary power is, according to Foucault \"exercised through its invisibility . . . and the examination is the technique by which power, instead of emitting the signs of its potency, 96. Michel Foucault, Power: Essential Works of Foucault 1954-1984, ed. James D. Faubion, trans. Robert Hurley (New York: The New York Press, 2000), 57. 204 P harmacopowerinstead of imposing its mark on its subjects, holds them in a mechanism of objectification.\"97 The purpose of these forms of architecture is not simply to provide habitat or represent the individual\u2014instead, like true performative devices, they tend to produce the subject they claim to shel-ter. The convict, the student, the patient, the soldier, and the worker are the political precipitate of these architec - tural technologies of subjectification. We can think of the Pill as a lightweight, portable, individualized, chemical panopticon with the potential to change behavior, program action, regulate sexual activity, control population growth and racial purity, and redesign the sexual appearance (by refeminizing it synthetically) of the bodies that self-administer it. The surveillance tower has been replaced by the eyes of the (not always) docile user of the Pill who regulates her own administration with-out the need for external supervision, following the spatial calendar marked on the circular or rectangular package. The whip has been replaced by a convenient system of oral administration. Henceforth, the prison cell has become the body of the consumer, which sees itself chemically modi-fied without being able to determine the exact effects or where they come from, once the hormonal compound has been ingested. Punishments and edifying sermons have been replaced by rewards and promises of freedom and sexual emancipation for women. The Pill is a miniaturized pharmacopornographic laboratory distributed within the domestic environment and destined to be placed inside 97. Foucault, Discipline and Punish, 187.Pharmacopower 205the body of each consumer, thus fulfilling the demolition of imprisonment institutions predicted by Deleuze and Guattari in their epilogue to A Thousand Plateaus. 98 The Pill works according to what Maurizio Lazzarato, following Deleuze and Guattari, enslave-ment.\" \"Machinic enslavement,\" explains Lazzarato: consists in mobilizing the pre-individual, pre-cognitive and pre-verbal components of subjectiv - ity, causing affects, perceptions and sensations as yet un-individuated or unassigned to a subject, to function like the cogs and components in a machine. While subjec - tion concerns social selves or global persons, those highly manipulable, molar, subjective representations, 'machinic enslavement connects infrapersonal, infrasocial elements thanks to a molecular economy of desire which is far more difficult to maintain within stratified social relation-ships,' and these are the elements that mobilize individu-ated subjects. Machinic enslavement is therefore not the same thing as social subjection. If the latter appeals to the molar, individuated dimension of a subjectivity, the former activates its molecular, pre-individual, pre-verbal, pre-social dimension. 99 It is no longer necessary to shut up individuals within state institutions in order to subject them to biochemical, pedagogic, or penal tests, because experiments on the liv - ing human being can now be carried out at home, in the valuable enclave of the individual body, under the watchful, intimate supervision of the individual herself. And all of it 98. Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia, trans. Brian Massumi (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, harmacopowerhappens freely , by virtue of the sexual emancipation of the controlled body. The biopolitical promise of governing free bodies that Foucault identified is here fully accomplished. Still, the differences between the panopticon and the Pill are significant. Within the length of hardly a century, they underline the transition from a disciplinary regime into a pharmacopornographic regime. In the first case, we're faced with an external political architecture that defines the position of the body in a space that is collec - tively regulated, creating specific professor/student . . . ) and allowing the generation of a form of knowing (visual, sta-tistical, demographic) concerning those individuals being controlled. In the second case, we're faced with a mecha-nism that\u2014without any change in its effectiveness\u2014has reduced its scale to that of a biomolecular technology that may be consumed individually and introduced by bodily ori-fices. In the pharmacopornographic era, the body swallows power. It is a form of control that is both democratic and private, edible, drinkable, inhalable, and easy to administer, whose spread throughout the social body has never been so rapid or so undetectable. In the pharmacopornographic age, biopower dwells at home, sleeps with us, inhabits within. The dominant manifestations of the pharmacopor - nographic era (pills, prostheses, food, images, fellatio, and double penetration) share the same relationship between the body and power: a desire for infiltration, absorption, total occupation. We could give in to the temptation of rep-resenting this relationship according to a dialectical model of domination/oppression, as if it were a unidirectional Pharmacopower 207movement in which miniaturized, liquid power from the outside infiltrates the obedient body of individuals. But no. It is not power infiltrating from the outside, it is the body desiring power, seeking to swallow it, eat it, administer it, wolf it down, more, always more, through every hole, by every possible route of application. Turning oneself into power. Baise-Moi, fuck me (Despentes), says the body, all the while seeking forms of autocontrol and autoextermi-nation: \"Why do people always desire their own slavery?\" (Spinoza). Biopower doesn't infiltrate from the outside. It already . But machinic enslavement also determines new possi- bilities for subversion. The Pill\u2014defined by the need for an individual decision to take it and by the time-based calcula-tions of the user\u2014immediately induces accident. It takes accident into account, programs it, sees accident as a sine qua non possibility of female sexuality. The heteronorma-tive logic of the Cold War period that dominates the Pill seems to respond to this double, contradictory require-ment: every woman must simultaneously be fertile (and be so through heterosexual insemination) and able to reduce the possibility of her own fertility at all times to levels asymptotically close to zero, but without reducing it alto-gether, so that accidental conception remains possible. But the accident is also the possibility of subversion and resig-nification: the fact that the Pill must be managed at home, by the individual user in an autonomous way, also intro-duces the possibility of political agency. The massive, high-dose administration of estrogens and progesterone to the bodies of Western cis-females after 208 P harmacopowerWorld War II permitted the production and reproduction of femininity as a standardized and ready-made biocode. This new microprosthetic femininity is a patented phar - macopornographic technology, which can be commercial-ized\u2014or transferred to and implanted in\u2014any living body at all. Gradually, it will be revealed that the estrogens and progesterone administered in high doses during this period are toxic and carcinogenic and to blame for various cardio-vascular changes, but such findings do nothing to lower consumption of the Pill (in fact, its consumption increased exponentially beginning in the 1970s); nor do they change recommendations coming from the World Health Organi-zation (WHO). The amount of estrogen and progesterone intended for a month of treatment has changed from 150 micrograms of estrogen and 200 milligrams of progesterone in the 1970s to 10 micrograms of estrogen and 15 milligrams of different variants of progesterone in today's contraceptive treatments. As a measure to improve security, the current micropill (which is the most prescribed drug for periods of breast-feeding) administers a weaker dose during a greater number of days, reducing the number of days in which a placebo pill is taken, during which what we could call the technoperiod is produced\u2014in other words, a technologically induced bleeding that produces the illusion of a natural cycle. These are technological methods of biodrag whose objective is the \"mimicking of the normal physiological cycle.\" From Pincus's second pill to today's micropill, these technologies of hormonal invention have been functioning according to a principle of biocamouflage: first, interrupt -Pharmacopower 209ing the natural hormonal cycle, and then, technologically provoking an artificial cycle that re-creates the illusion of nature. The first of these actions is contraceptive, the sec - ond is the consequence of an intended pharmacoporno-graphic production of gender\u2014seeing to it that the bodies of twentieth-century technofemales perpetuate the illusion of being the outcome of natural, unchanging, transhistoric, and transcultural laws. A recent study carried out at Boston University reveals the relationship between consumption of the contracep-tive pill, the decline in the levels of bioavailability of tes - tosterone (a reduction from 40 percent to 60 percent), and the drop in women's libido. The study warns that taking synthetic estrogen can modify hormonal production on a global scale and recommends administering testosterone gel in microdoses to increase \"the sexual functioning of female consumers of the pill.\" 100 But today, administering testosterone to women still remains a hormonal taboo with political implications. The production of femininity in the pharmacopornographic regime functions according to a paradoxical logic: on the one hand, the Pill is being admin-istered to cis-females in a generalized manner, and on the other, a pharmacological way of overcoming depression and frigidity is the goal. 101 The cis-female of the twenty- 100.

Goldstein, \"Impact of Oral Contraceptives on Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin and Androgen Levels: A Retrospective Study in Women with Sexual Dysfunction,\" The Journal of Sexual Medicine 3 (January 2006): 104-13. 101. This logic is comparable to the relationship between the repression of masturbation and the production of fits of hysteria using mechanical means in the sex-discipline agenda of the nineteenth century. See an analysis of this paradoxical production in of this somato-political short-cir - cuiting; her subjectivity grows within the narrow margin of freedom created by these fields of divergent force. The formation of the pharmacopornographic society was characterized by the two new vectors of production of sexual subjectivity at the middle of the twentieth century. On the one hand, as we have seen, there is the introduction of the notion of \"gender\" as a technical, visual, and perfor - mative device for sexing the body, the reorganization of the medico-judicial, educational, and medical system that until that time had been articulating the notions of \"normalcy\" and \"perversion\" in the context of the binomial concept of heterosexuality/homosexuality and will now begin consid-ering the possibility of technically modifying the body of the individual to \"invent\" a masculine or feminine \"mind.\" On the other hand, we are witnessing techniques of social control that are suitable for the disciplinary system gradu-ally filtering into the individual body. What is at issue is no longer only the punishment of the sexual offenses of individuals or the surveillance and correction of their aber - rations by means of a code of external laws or interiorized disciplines, but the modification of their bodies in their capacity as living platforms. We are treated as producers and consumers of organs, flux, neurotransmitters, as sup-ports and effects of a biopolitical program. We are certainly still confronting a form of social control, but this time it's a matter of control lite, a bubbly type of control, full of col-ors and wearing Mickey Mouse ears and the Brigitte Bardot low-cut look, as opposed to the cold, disciplinary architec - ture of the panoptic illustrated by Foucault. Pharmacopower 211After the 1950s, the construction of biofemininity becomes a process of somato-political construction (bio- drag). It consists of a progression of molecular overcodifi-cation\u2014a transformation of the structure of life, and not a simple disguise or mask, as postmodern theories of gender like to claim. 102 The breasts, for example: their weight, form, and consistency have acquired a plastic pertinence (in the medical sense of the term), transforming them gradually into a techno-somatic signifier of the production of gen-der. 103 They have materialized as a place for new patholo- gies, such as hypomastia (small-breast symptom) or breast cancer, which appeared at the same time as the techniques of mastectomy and breast reconstruction using synthetic implants, the incidences of which increased exponentially beginning in the 1960s. 104 The H-bomb, the birth control pill, silicone implants, breast cancer . . . From ablation to reconstruction to augmentation, the twentieth-century breast functions above all as prosthesis. In other words, every biobreast exists in relation to its own cultural pros - thesis. Accordingly, it's just as suitable to speak of techno-breasts when referring to cis-females as it is when referring to transsexual bodies, rather than making a distinction between the natural female breast and the prosthetic. 102. For example, an extreme example of a postmodern theory of gender would be that developed by Jean Baudrillard in Simulacres et simulation (Paris: Editions Galil\u00e9e, 1981); this shouldn't be confused with the performative definition of gender developed by Judith Butler or Sue Ellen Case. 103.

Elizabeth Haiken, Venus Envy: A History of Cosmetic Surgery (Baltimore: The John Hopkins University Press, 1999).212 P harmacopowerSince the beginning of the twentieth century, new syn- thetic materials, architectural structures, the techniques of artistic collage and of film editing have moved toward the domain of corporal transformation. 105 For example, paraf - fin was one of the first substances used in the construc - tion of \"island flaps,\" the envelopes for breast implants but also for testicular implants (typically used for soldiers who had lost one or two testicles during war), as well as for the reconstruction of the \"syphilitic nose.\" In the 1920s, paraffin was abandoned in favor of gum arabic, rubber, cel-lulose, ivory, and various metals. In 1949, Ivalon, a deriva-tive of polyvinyl alcohol, would be used to produce the first breast implant by subcutaneous injection. The first recipi-ent of these rudimentary implants were Japanese female sex workers, immediately following the war, whose bodies would need to undergo a process of standardization that conformed to the heterosexual requirements of American army consumption. 106 Body transformations have reached a global scale; just as bodies were affected by radiation from the plutonium used in the H-bomb, they will henceforth be affected by polymerized silicone. After 1953, pure silicone becomes the preferred material for the manufacturing of prosthetic implants. Shortly after that, Dow Corning mar - kets the first tube of silicone gel for clinical use. Although highly toxic, its use will continue until the beginning of the 1990s. 105. See Mark Nelson and Sarah Hudson Bayliss, Exquisite Corpse: Surrealism and the Black Dahlia Murder (New York: Bulfinch, 2006), which notes the unusual study about the relationship between the surrealist aesthetic and the murder of the Black Dahlia, whose name will become the title of a novel by James Ellroy. 106. Marilyn Yalom, A History of Breast (New York: Ballantine Books, 1998), 236-38.Pharmacopower 213Contrary to what one might think, the biodrag dimen- sion of the pharmacopornographic production of the body ( somatic camp) doesn't depend exclusively on the use of synthetic materials in its reconstruction of a corporal normality deemed natural. One of the first tech- niques of breast reconstruction will make its appearance at the end of the nineteenth century when Dr. Vincent Czerny collects a large lipoma growing on the back of his patient to use as material to compensate for a breast that was removed, thereby performing an autograft. 107 Years later, the same principle will be used in the development of autoimplants of body fat for face lifts and the reshaping of the body. The difference between bio- and techno- is not a differ - ence between organic and inorganic. In this text, I am not evaluating a passage from the biological to the synthetic but identifying the appearance of a new type of corporal-ity. Recent technologies for the production of the body are not faithful to a classical taxonomy according to which each organ and each tissue corresponds to a single function and location. Far from respecting the formal or material total-ity of the body, biotechnology and prosthetic technologies combine modes of representation related to film and archi-tecture, like modeling and editing in 3-D. The new surgi-cal technology, which has made possible the application of pharmacopornographic ideas of sexuality (the techni-cal management of masculinity and femininity, the medi-calization of the orgasm and sexual desire, telecontrol of 107. Gilman, Making the Body, 249.214 P harmacopowerthe fantasy functions of sexuality, etc.) is authorizing pro- cesses of the tectonic construction of the body, according to which its organs, tissues, fluids, and, ultimately, molecules, are transformed into the raw materials from which a new incarnation of nature is manufactured. microprosthetic control Placing research on producing a male birth control pill on the back burner, the pharmaceutical industries have turned toward the development of new methods for administer - ing hormones to women, designed to reduce the scope of management that individual use of the Pill permitted. Most current clinical tests serve the goal of producing a technique of hormonal administering that avoids the oral and intentional route. According to the claims of the phar - maceutical companies, this promotes the following advan-tages: reduced assimilation of steroids by the liver, reduced risk of short-term memory loss, and improved absorption by effusion of a constant level of doses of hormones into the blood. The first injectable combinations of estrogen and progesterone at a frequency of once a month appeared in the 1990s (like Depo-Provera). The following decade wit - nessed a gradual program of marketing implants with a base of progestogen, from a six-capsule subdermal implant of silicone progesterone for the skin of the arm (Norplant) to two capsules (Norplant 2, Jadelle) or a single capsule (Implanon). These implants, which currently can release their hormonal compound for between one to five years, become invisible and undetectable once they are placed Pharmacopower 215under the skin (from which they sometimes cannot be removed).108 Again, here it's possible to identify the liquid and microprosthetic future of technologies for controlling sexuality, which used to be a rigid, exterior, visible, and weighty affair. Implanon isn't very different from the classical intra- uterine system (the IUD), especially the model that releases progesterone into the uterine cavity. The difference lies in the place of insertion on the body. Implanon is placed under the skin of the arm, which gives the illusion that it intervenes less in the regulation of sexuality, because the mechanism doesn't directly touch the organs cultur - ally considered to be sexual. Other mechanisms that have recently been marketed are the vaginal ring (inserted into the vagina and left there for twenty-one days, then removed for five days to simulate the natural rhythms of menstrua-tion), and especially, the transdermal contraceptive patch, which is becoming more and more popular. Both devices contain ethinylestradiol combined with progesterone. At the other extreme of the gender equation, a growth in the administration of synthetic testosterone as a substi-tution therapy for cis-males has established new perspec - tives for hormonal research and marketing. 109 The German laboratory Schering, a world leader in contraception with its Yasmin pill, has faced a situation of increasingly intense 108. For more about injectable contraceptives and implants, see Robert A. Hatcher, James Trussell and Anita L. Nelson, eds., Contraceptive Technology, 19th ed. (New York: PDR Network, 2008), 145-70. 109. For more about testosterone deficiency and testosterone replacement therapy for cis-males, see Nelson Vergel, Testosterone: A Man's Guide , 2nd ed. (Houston: Milestones Publishing, 2011). 216 P harmacopowercommercial competition for some time now. Hoping to remain in the vanguard in this expanding market, in 2004 Schering began the first clinical trials evaluating the effec - tiveness of various contraceptive implants or injections for men, all aiming to decrease sperm levels. Such male con-traception is founded on principles similar to those behind the female pill. Its effectiveness is based on a formulation of a base of progestogen that acts to suppress the produc - tion of spermatozoids; its use would be combined with a substitution therapy derived from a base of testosterone in order to maintain levels of libido and erection. In the twen-tieth century, no new contraceptive methods have been developed for cis-males. Rubber condoms and sterilization today remain the only low-tech techniques for directly con-trolling the social circulation of male reproductive cells. It is interesting to note that, although the male pill has not been marketed yet, China and India have tried to develop biopolitical programs of reproductive control that include the management of the male body. 110 The pharmacopor - nographic challenge of the twenty-first century will be the marketing of a panoply of hormonal compounds (often supplemented with testosterone) for cis-males without calling into question the natural makeup of masculinity. At the same time, as a way of compensating for the established scientific relationship between hormones and cancer, the new contraceptive pills for cis-females are presented as instruments of beauty and feminization\u2014 110. See Oudshoorn, Male Pill , 7.Pharmacopower 217a molecular supplement for somatic refeminization.111 Today's pharmaceutical companies announce their desire to produce a contraceptive pill based on \"selective estrogen receptor modulators\" (SERMs) that will lower the risk of breast cancer\u2014similar to butter that lowers cholesterol lev - els or methadone as a substitution drug that reduces heroin addiction. The Pill, a key performative prosthesis of the pharmaco- pornographic regime, is evolving from a simple technique of birth control to a genuine program for the cosmetic pro- 111. The gynecologists whom I've visited over the last fifteen years, disinterested in my announcement of my trans-queer sexuality, which is exclusively dildoic or anal, suggested with astonishing frequency that I use the Pill as a contraceptive measure. They praise its virtues as a \"regulator of the menstrual cycle\" and as a way of \"alleviating menstrual pains,\" without mentioning its side effects, except for the carcinogenic risks of its interaction with tobacco. In reality, this is a means of administering cis-females the necessary pharmacopornographic dose of estrogen and progesterone to transform cis-females into a normalized heterosexual female body, with a depressive but stable temperament and a passive or frigid sexuality. 218 P harmacopowerduction of femininity; it is appearing more and more fre- quently as a therapy for the treatment of acne or hirsutism (body and facial hair on cis-females) or to increase the vol-ume and improve the form of the breasts. Accordingly, new pills with a base of progesterone are being manufactured, among them Drospirenone, which is marketed in Germany and, thanks to its anti-mineral-corticoid properties, prom-ises weight loss and reduced water retention. Today, hor - monal therapies also appeal to women in a consumer public who are looking to reduce the frequency and intensity of their periods. Use of these therapies as contraception is decreasing as they become more common in managing menstrual cycles (for example, the new implants allow total elimination of the period for five years). As we have seen, such potential is not new; it was, on the contrary, one of the side effects of the first contraceptive pill developed in the 1950s. During that decade, which saw the gradual displacement of the disciplinary sexopolitical mechanism toward new pharmacopornographic techniques, these effects seemed incompatible with the metaphysics of sex that established an inexorable equation between feminin-ity, fertility, and maternity. At the same time, we are witnessing a growing spate of marketing campaigns in which the Pill is referred to as an \"emergency postcoital contraceptive,\" as in the \"morning-after pill,\" and the abortion pill Mifepristone, also known as RU-486. China was the first country to approve the use of Mifepristone, which was commercialized by the French pharmaceutical company Roussel Uclaf in 1988; China began its own domestic production in 1992. Although Pharmacopower 219current bioethical debates tend to establish a difference between the Western use of contraceptives and the use of abortive methods within totalitarian regimes, political agency does not depend only on the molecules but rather on their use and critical reappropriation. In the context of a fast-expanding pharmacoporno- graphic sexopolitical model in which a multitude of poten-tial consumers have increasing access to the molecular production of their gender and sexuality, modulated by the fluctuations of the pharmaceutical market, implants and micropills are heralding a new type of high-tech hetero-sexuality (which differs radically from nineteenth-century Victorian heterosexuality): the techno-Barbie, remaining eternally young and supersexualized, almost entirely infer - tile and nonmenstruating but always ready for artificial insemination and accompanied by a sterile supermacho whose erections are technically produced by a combina-tion of Viagra and audiovisual pornographic codes emitted through computerized digital channels. Finally, pharma-copornographic heterosexual fertilization is happening in vitro. With the creation in the 1970s of postmenopausal hor - monal substitution therapies using a base of estrogen and progesterone (in the form of gels, very similar to the Tes - togel that I administer, but also in the form of patches or nasal spray), and their expansion beginning in the 1990s, the cis-female of the twenty-first century is becoming a potential consumer of synthetic hormones who will be tak - ing them for almost fifty years of her life. Now we must add ten or fifteen years of postmenopausal treatment to 220 P harmacopowerforty years of contraceptive treatment. In the near future, we will have mastered other methods that today are experi-mental: the contraceptive vaccine, also known as immuno-contraception, which \"immunizes\" the organism against the development of an embryo or prevents the ovum from accepting a spermatozoid. One could press on much further with the inventory of such microtechnologies for the man-agement of sexual subjectivity, but in any case, one thing is clear: when it comes to the allocation of funds for financ - ing clinical research, such methods of contraception are in competition with the urgent need to develop methods of prevention of, or a vaccine against, the HIV virus. the enemy Hormone: testosterone and Gender terrorism The twentieth century began with the first attempt to market a patch for testosterone for cis-females. In 2004, after several years of clinical tests, the US Food and Drug Administration refused Procter and Gamble authorization to market Intrinsa, the first patch, which administers three hundred micrograms of testosterone a day to cis-females as a remedy for \"hypoactive sexual desire disorder\" (HSDD), or lack of sexual desire. 112 The product was intended, according to Procter and Gamble, for \"women who have had their ovaries removed,\" but the company was hoping to indirectly reach a much larger public: all the consumers of the Pill who were suffering from lowered testosterone levels. The evaluation of hormonal risks, carried out by the 112. While I was finishing the corrections for this book, Intrinsa had just received a license for pharmaceutical exploitation, beginning March 2007, in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe. Pharmacopower 221FDA, obviously did not use the same criteria as those used in the evaluation of progesterone as treatment for ovary ablation or for menopause. Numerous articles, including one published in the overly scrupulous New York Times denounced the \"political character\" of this medical decision and pointed out the pressure that could be exerted on the many \"conservative members\" of the relevant committee of the FDA. It was the opinion of this committee that \"despite the promising results of this substance in improving the sex lives of patients, its use does not seem to be justified.\" Even more surprising is the fact that the committee character - ized testosterone for women as a \"lifestyle drug\"\u2014some-thing like Ecstasy or poppers, but for menopausal women. In place of the \"strengthened orgasm\" promised by Intrinsa (formulated with testosterone), the FDA proposed a range of legal drugs (whose effectiveness is doubtful) to stimu-late the sexual function for cis-females: vaginal for Intrinsa is enor - mous. A study of the market recently conducted in the US by a pharmaceutical company focusing on sexual stimu-lants for cis-females delivered the following results: 46 percent of women say they have never had an orgasm, and 64 percent of married heterosexual women think their sex life is unsatisfying. Another sign of biopolitical displace-ment: whereas the disciplinary regime of the eighteenth 113. See Kathy Hill, \"FDA Panel Rejects Intrinsia,\" About.com , centuries pathologized and medicalized the sexual desire of women as a cause of hysteria, mas - turbation, nymphomania, perversion, or homosexuality, the new pharmacopornographic regime for the first time sanctions the lack of sexual pleasure and desire in women and plans its technical production. And here is the name of that new illness (or somato-political fiction): FSD, female sexual dysfunction. According to these estimates, ten mil-lion women in the United States could be candidates for a therapy to promote sexual desire and sexual functioning, in addition to thirty million menopausal women who could gradually attain the status of potential consumers of the product. What could be the FDA's reasons for turning down such a growth market? Pharmacopornographic capitalism clashes with the boundaries of the gender binary episte-mology, which continue to function according to models of femininity and masculinity inherited from the nineteenth-century sexopolitical regime that established a strict conti-nuity between sex, sexuality, and reproduction. The gender barriers will not fall easily. Instead, the pharmacological and medical industries prefer to look for new molecules to offset the side effects of testosterone in women (\"virilism,\" \"hirsutism\"), which are considered undesirable in a hetero-sexual system. The pharmacopornographic regime does not simply displace the disciplinary biopolitical regime of the nineteenth century, but rather establishes unexpected and strategic alliances with it, creating new somato-political fictions as strange as the Viagra-user-sperm-donor or the sexually-dysfunctional-female-consumer-of-the-Pill. Pharmacopower 223the t uber-male of the Future Although the administration of microdoses of testosterone to cis-females is still rare, testosterone has been recom-mended for more than thirty years in hormonal substitu-tion therapies for cis-males. The most common method of administration is through AndroGel, distributed in the form of a testosterone gel comparable to the Testogel that I'm taking and produced by Unimed Pharmaceuticals in the state of Illinois. Anabolic steroids, derivatives that are more or less simi- lar to testosterone, have been used for thirty years to treat hypogonadism, a physiological condition in which the tes - ticles don't produce \"enough\" testosterone. For the medi-cal establishment, testosterone functions as a substance for the manufacture of masculinity. But it isn't defined as a molecule used to make up for a lack. The role of synthetic testosterone consists in producing the masculine subject that it pretends to supplement; however, the possibility of it being incorporated in a variety of bodies, and its transfer from skin to skin, also opens the way for postidentity drift. The Nazi government, followed by the American gov - ernment, were the first to experiment with administering doses of testosterone to animals, as well as to their own sol-diers, the civilian population in concentration camps, and prisoners of war. Technologies of gender and technologies of war\u2014the same business. Necropolitics meets biopoli-tics under the skin. By the 1980s, the pharmaceutical use of testosterone became widespread. In 2006 in the United States, there were four million cis-males undergoing hor - monal substitution therapy formulated with testosterone. 224 P harmacopowerAccording to the medical establishment, thirteen million Americans over the age of forty-five suffer from what is now known as \"low-T syndrome,\" a condition character - ized by an insufficiency of testosterone. The symptoms: a decrease in libido, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, depression, and so on\u2014eventually, the ordinary life of any average cis-male. 114 Clinically, there is not enough testosterone being produced in United States. As seen in contemporary scientific discourse, it has become evident that estrogen, progesterone, and testoster - one are transverse substances produced by all bodies, inde-pendently of their gender (biopolitically assigned at birth), and that, like the molecules secreted by the pancreas and hypothalamus and by the parathyroid, thyroid, thymus, and pineal glands, function in a systemic and decentralized man-ner. Cis-females also produce testosterone in the ovaries and in the adrenal glands. Moreover, today we know that in cis-females, testosterone may be responsible for muscular development, the growth of bones, and sexual desire. The singularity of all hormonal systems (and not the difference between just two systems) resides in the micro-quantities of hormones occurring in each body, in the num-ber of hormonal receptors, and in systemic interactions with the other hormones and receptors. An examination of several clinical endocrinology manuals reveals that the question of the \"normal\" quantity of testosterone produced by cis-males and cis-females is closely related to the cultural and biopolitical definition of gender difference. For exam- 114. Vergel, Testosterone , 2. Pharmacopower 225ple, the average levels of testosterone in the blood of bodies politically considered to be normally male range from 437 to 707 nanograms per deciliter. But certain bodies produce no more than 125 nanograms per deciliter, and their sexual assignment is still male. According to another manual, also of clinical endocrinology, the \"normal\" quantity of testos - terone production in adult cis-males varies from 260 to 1,000 nanograms per deciliter of blood. It can rise as high as 2,000 nanograms during adolescence. In cis-females, it is 15 to 70 nanograms per deciliter of blood. To such episte-mological chaos we must add several absurd pieces of data coming from scientific research: testosterone increases the desire to smoke, but the consumption of cigarettes low - ers the production of testosterone; testosterone increases aggressiveness and libido, whereas sex and aggressive reac - tions increase testosterone Stress inhibits the pro-duction of testosterone . . . In the end, we are brought face to face with a vast domain of nonknowledge and potential technopolitical intervention. Given such complexity, an implacable biopolitical rheto- ric about gender, sexual, and racial differences, similar to that elaborated by Arnold Berthold at the beginning of the twentieth century, always dominates hormonal clas - sification and its technical management. Although the experimental programs that determine the production of marketable doses of testosterone, estrogen, or progester - one rely on an ultraconstructivist theory of sex and sexu-ality, the criteria for the commercialization and public distribution of these molecules continues to respond to a naturalistic metaphysics of sexual difference that claims 226 P harmacopowerthe biologically and historically unchangeable existence of two sexes (man and woman), two sexualities (heterosexual and homosexual), and, more recently, two genders (male and female), from which springs the field of deviance and pathology. For the moment, no Western nation has accepted the legalization of testosterone for women and allowed it to be freely administered to them, understanding that such a sit - uation would risk a semiotechnical virilization of the female population on its both social and political levels. Two slight somato-political problems that would modify the visual and auditory deciphering of gender are facial pilosity and voice change. It is astounding that in the West, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, in a society that has extremely high-tech methods for the management of reproduction, the deciphering of gender is reduced to degree of facial hair and timbre of the voice. We can therefore say that the beard and the voice, and not the penis and the vagina or X and Y chromosomes, are the dominant cultural public signifiers of gender in our society. Let us cease to speak about men and women and simply say, hairy or smooth body, body with a high voice or with a low voice. These are not details but crucial sexopolitical signifiers with the ability to put into question the idea of virility as the natural prerogative of cis-males. The ultimate problem resides in revealing the politically constructed character of the genders, as well as of heterosexuality and homosexuality. While I am following my testosterone protocol, sev - eral European governments, including the French gov - ernment and the generality of Catalonia, are studying the Pharmacopower 227use of \"chemical castration\" technologies as a penal mea- sure (rather than a therapeutic one) for sex offenders (and especially for pedophiles). The French right-wing president Nicolas Sarkozy's intention, made public on August 21, 2007, to create a law mandating the use of chemical cas - tration therapies for sex offenders, is one more step in the escalation of the use of biopolitical power to produce and control male sexuality. What processes of bodily transfor - mation are really entailed by such chemical castration? When, how, and on which bodies have similar means of the pharmacological management of identity been already used? What are the underlying political fictions of mascu-linity and femininity connected to this legal project, and what type of subject are we trying to produce collectively? Let us examine our pharmacopornopolitical archives: chemical castration consists in administering a cocktail more or less full of antiandrogens (cyproterone acetate, progestogen, or gonadotropin regulators), in other words, molecules that inhibit the production of testosterone. Although one of the effects of antiandrogens can be the diminishment of sexual desire (thought of in this case as excitation and erectile response), it is often not mentioned that the side effects of these drugs are a reduction in the size of the penis, the development of breasts, modifica-tion of muscle mass, and accumulation of fat in the hips. In other words, it is a process of \"hormonal feminization.\" We ought not be surprised to discover that substances with similar antiandrogen effects are used (voluntarily) by transsexuals who are beginning a process of feminization and are changing their gender.228 P harmacopowerDespite its renaturalizing power, the pharmacoporno regime continually reveals its ultraconstructivist founda- tions. If we explore the political history of the chemical castration technology, we will learn that it was used in the 1950s in the repressive treatment of male homosexuality; it was, for example, the type of therapy prescribed by Eng-lish law for Alan Turing, one of the originators of modern computer science. Accused of homosexuality, grave inde-cency, and sexual perversion, he was compelled to submit to a program of hormonal therapy. 115 One sign of a certain scientific confusion is the fact that the same drug is part of current research on a \"gay bomb,\" a hormonal compound that the American army intends to use to transform its ene-mies into homosexuals. 116 While the United States needs testosterone, its enemies need hormonal feminization. What the facts show is that chemical castration is a pharmacopornopolitical mechanism aiming less to reduce sexual aggression than to modify the gender of the sup-posed aggressor. It's important to draw attention to these therapies as existing exclusively to manage the male \"sex - ual predator.\" And the means of punishing and controlling male sexuality is to transform it symbolically and somati-cally into femininity. The double-edged effect of these pharmacopornographic policies connects with traditional modes of producing sex - 115. Alan Turing finally committed suicide in 1954. See Andrew Hodges and Douglas Hofstadter, Alan Turing: The Enigma (New York: Walker & Company, 2000). 116. For more about the homophobic fantasy of American war discourse, see Judith Butler, \"Contingent Foundations: Feminism and the Question of 'Postmodernism,'\" Praxis International 11, no. 2 (July 1991): 150-65. An excerpt from this article was also published with another title: \"The Imperialist Subject,\" Journal of Urban and Cultural Studies 2, no. 2 (1991): 73-78.Pharmacopower 229ual difference in the disciplinary regime: political crimi- nalization of male sexuality and victimization of female sexuality. Chemical regulation always portrays the erection, and as a corollary, masculinity, as a phenomenon that can be produced or heightened by vasodilators or controlled and repressed by chemical castration, 117 thereby placing it in the category of an involuntary impulse that is suitable for political management. Meanwhile, feminine sexuality is constructed as a passive territory on which the violence of male sexuality is exerted. There is no biological destiny beyond pharmacopornopolitical programs. Democratizing the consumption of hormones, which continue to be viewed as sexual, would require a radical change of our gender and sexual topographies. Freely cir - culating and collectively used testosterone is dynamite for the heterosexual regime. It's no longer only a question of asserting the existence of four or five sexes, as several sci-entists and theorists of sexuality desire, 118 but of accepting the completely technoconstructed, undeniably multiple, malleable, and mutable nature of bodies and pleasures. the Pill and State Feminism The masterstroke of the pharmacopornographic regime is its having exploited the revolutionary and emancipatory rhetoric of the feminist movement of the 1960s to pass off the chemical and contraceptive management of the female body as a step toward sexual liberation. In the same way, 117. Let's not forget that Fran\u00e7ois Evrard, the catalyst who launched this legal polemic in France, had a pack of Viagra in his pocket at the time of the rape. 118. cf. Anne Fausto-Sterling, \"The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough,\" The Sciences (March/April 1993): 20-24.230 P harmacopowerabolitionist feminism entrusted the management of the production and representation of pornography and the sex industry to the state, by demanding the abolition of prostitution and the penalization of pornography. 119 In the case of pornography, the result of these measures was the reduction of the sex industry to an underground economy and the marginalization and impoverishment of its work - ers. When it comes to the \"politics of family planning,\" the result is administration on a vast scale of estrogen and progesterone for every cis-female in the fertile years. We can assert, and not without a certain rage, that white lib-eral abolitionist feminism was able to function as one of the paragovernmental ideological devices of the pharma-copornographic regime. It becomes necessary to oppose state feminism with a molecular and postpornographic transfeminism. The grammar and techniques that liberal feminism has plundered from us must be reappropriated to trigger a new counter-pharmacopornographic revolution. As a contraceptive method, feminism could have made masturbation obligatory, promulgated a sexual strike among heterosexual and fertile women, and advocated les - bianism en masse; made it obligatory to tie the Fallopian tubes at adolescence; and legalized abortion and made it free\u2014if not permitting infanticide when necessary. And there is a political-fiction scenario that could have been even more promising: it was possible, from a biotechno-logical point of view, to require all women who are of child- 119. The case most representative of using feminism as a state technique of control of prostitution and pornography occurred in the nineties in Canada, where the state solicited feminist rhetoric to establish its abolitionist politics.Pharmacopower 231bearing age to take a monthly microdose of testosterone, as both a contraceptive measure and a political method of regulating gender. Such a measure would have ended once and for all sexual differentiation and the hegemony of het - erosexuality. This doesn't mean that cis-females (on tes - tosterone) would stop having sex with cis-males, but the act would not continue to be interpreted as purely hetero-sexual. It would have no reproductive goal; in addition, it would no longer be a question of an encounter between two people of opposite sexual orientations, but rather, between two people of gay orientation with the added possibility of vaginal penetration. Postwar feminism could have con-cerned itself with the management of the cis-male body and declared it to be of national interest: castration, male homosexuality, the obligatory use of condoms, the sealing of the seminal channel, mass administration of Androcur (to lower the production of testosterone in cis-males), and so on. Yes, there were other possibilities, but liberal femi-nism made a pact with the pharmacopornographic regime. Testo-trafficking As a drug, testosterone is relatively easy to buy and sell. A large quantity of it moves through the black market in the field of athletics and cycling. It can be administered through subcutaneous injection, gel, patch, implant, nasal inhaler, or aerosol. In 2006, the sports media called tes - tosterone \"the real winner of the Tour de France\" and had no qualms about claiming that \"testosterone is the drug of champions.\" Many high-level athletes have tested positive for the presence of synthetic testosterone in their blood. It 232 P harmacopowermakes me chuckle a little when I read interviews in which they declare, \"This testosterone is my own, it's natural.\" Poor idiots. It's like Pamela Anderson trying to pass her size 45E silicone prostheses off as natural just because she's a cis-female. It's not at all difficult to go to a bodybuilder's website to order ten doses of 250-milligram testosterone for seventy-five dollars, postage included. This is the par - adox inherent in the strict legal controls that govern the pharmacopornographic regime: gender is for sale. Applied to a woman's body, testosterone distorts that body's relationship to the course of time as well as its value on the heterosexual market. The temporal logic of the gen-ders is asymmetric. Femininity loses value three times faster than does masculinity. In other words, a woman (whether cis- or trans-) is out of the heterosexual market at forty-five, whereas a man can reach sixty-five before becoming obsolete. To calculate the true age of a woman in the het - erocapitalist economy, it's necessary to add fifteen years to make her equal to her male equivalent; then two years can be subtracted for each beauty advantage (breast size, thin-ness, length and thickness of the hair, etc.), and two years must be added for each social handicap (divorce, number of children\u2014each counting two years more\u2014unemployment, etc.). Let's take an example: Julie is thirty-two; she's a divorced cis-female with a child to take care of and keeps in shape, does yoga, is pretty but doesn't have a perfect body; she is slender and works in an insurance company: 32 + 15 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 45. That's the hard reality. She will have to stop thinking of herself as a youthful creature of thirty-two, because her real age in the heterocapitalist economy is Pharmacopower 233forty-five. Bye-bye, Julie. Another possibility would be to go over to the equivalent dyke market, where one's true age diminishes prodigiously. A woman who has reached forty-five in the heterocapitalist economy can arrive at the les - bian economy with a status close to adolescence. Bingo. Let us consider for a moment the possibility of a molecular revolution of the genders. What would happen if a large proportion of cis-females began collectively self-administering enough doses of testosterone to be socially identified as males? What value would natural masculin-ity possess? Such a politicohormonal fiction experiment becomes even more pertinent if one thinks that these future technomales, this new species of mutant cis-females identifiable as male bodies, would be capable of breeding and giving birth, corresponding to what Julia Kristeva calls the \"female genius.\" 120 After using testosterone for six months, at a rate of four hundred milligrams a month, facial pilosity and a changed voice become irreversible. On the other hand, interrupting the administration of tes - tosterone for a few months is enough for menstruation to return, and with it, the potential for fertilization, preg-nancy, and childbirth (although the beard and the voice change remain). Fertilization would be just as possible by sexual exchange of reproductive fluids as it would by medi-cally controlled insemination. Sex and in vitro are just two culturally assisted reproduction technologies. Let's take the example of two male bodies, a technomale that still has a vagina and uterus and a cis-male inseminating him by vagi- 120.

Ross Guberman (New York: Columbia University Press, 2001), ix.234 P harmacopowernal penetration using a biopenis possessing fertile sperma- tozoids (something that seems rarer and rarer in today's highly toxic ecology). Seen from the outside, this scene resembles the gay pornographic aesthetic of the twentieth century; but in reality, it goes beyond gay sex and hetero-sexual sex and points to a technosex future. Obviously, as a technomale, it would be equally possible to be inseminated with donor sperm. At any rate, we would be confronting a new species of technomale postsexual reproducer. And this is the beginning of new perspectives regarding struggles and pharmacopornographic resignifications. Since I've been taking testosterone, I look at the men and women going by me each day in the subway, supermar - ket, museum, as bodies whose political decoding has been abusively and brutally determined by the amount of tes - tosterone they produce or administer to themselves. In line with VD to see King Kong at the movies, 121 I amuse myself by taking each of the human forms passing into my field of vision and mentally increasing or decreasing its testos - terone level. The cis-males simply resemble women with more or less testosterone to which a biopolitical plus-value has been added, and who have been told since childhood, \"You're worth more than girls; the world belongs to you; they belong to you; your cock rules over everything that exists.\" Cis-females are just surgically and endocrinologi-cally modified \"men\": sophisticated and not so sophisti-cated interlacings of synthetic collagen, silicone implants, and active estrogen, but still lacking biopolitical legitimacy. 121.

Which is pref - erable: changing my personality and keeping my body, or changing my body and keeping my current manner of expe-riencing reality? A fake dilemma. Our personalities arise from this very gap between body and reality.

In the space of six months, these are the politi-cal surplus values obtained by a cis-female who ingests testosterone. Testosterone is immediate gratification, an abstract platform for the production of power, but without the abrupt comedown of coke, without the hole in your stom-ach that comes after the effects of crystal have worn off, without the grotesque self-satisfaction triggered by Prozac. There is only one drug like testosterone: heroin. The two drugs are politically dangerous and can lead to exclusion, marginalization, desocialization\u2014and in the case of testos - terone, cancer (as is the case for almost all industrial prod-ucts) as well as hair loss (a lesser disadvantage that you can compensate for with a prosthesis). I think about taking another dose, the last one\u2014yet again, the last one. Am I going to become a testo-maniac? Starting with my own experience, with my practice of voluntary hormonal intoxication, I develop a theory (a Testo- ma nia 237completely absurd one) about heterosexual attraction. It has always seemed inexplicable to me, since I was a child. Understanding heterosexuality as a technology of \"hor - monal enrichment,\" because my essays are leading me toward such a theory, hardly fascinates me. It is a prepos - terous hypothesis that reveals something that I find disqui-eting. What if cis-females known as \"heterosexual\" were trying to rub shoulders with (cis- or trans-) men to obtain their dose of testosterone from the sweat of their partner? Something as simple as that. Cis-chicks sleeping with (cis- or trans-) guys in order to collect their dose of T, through fric - tion with their skin. That would also explain the progressive masculinization of female sex workers, who develop more facial fuzz than wage-earning cis-females, such as those who work as cashiers at convenience stores. As a result of repeated contact with the testosterone-infused sweat of their clients, the percentage of testosterone in their blood begins to increase. I'm not being serious. This idea is most probably the effect on my brain of too much reading about endocrinology; or, maybe, it's an accurate explanation of the functioning of one of the hormonal channels of our political makeup. There are two possibilities, then: either I'm losing my mind or I'm possessed by your spirit. yOur sperM and My O Va I can feel you next to me, as if you were alive.

According to you, she's like a teacher from the sticks who always wants to know if you've done your homework. You wait for me at the caf\u00e9 next to the Center for Wobbly Knee Rehabilitation. We order two coffees. We aren't drinking alcohol. We're sav - ing ourselves for the possibility of there being a little coke, crystal, or E at the bar where we're going tonight. You're not in a good mood. Unshaven, wearing the same white T-shirt, the same light-blue cotton sweater, and the same jeans you were wearing two days ago. Je te trouve sexe. You're exhaling testosterone. You say you haven't fucked anybody for a long time. That you're becoming a lesbian. I myself can think only about sex. Even so, I'm not fuck - ing anybody right now. You order two double espressos, one right after the other. I get one espresso with a drop of milk, a noisette. When you speak to me, you don't look me in the eye. You look at my hands, roll pieces of the paper tablecloth into pellets, then flick them at me. I ask you to stop bugging me. I punch you in the shoulder, not hard, just a sharp tap, as if to say, get it together. We discuss mixing your sperm with my ova. I don't know how we get into that conversation. No one asked anyone for anything. You're reading Sloterdijk's \"Rules for the Human Theme-Park.\" If the explosion of the first two atomic bombs over Hiro-shima and Nagasaki in 1945 mark the beginning of a geo-political apocalypse, then the appearance of the first cloned sheep known as Dolly marks the beginning of a biological apocalypse. Humanity does not exist under the sign of the divine, you say, but of the monstrous. Human stands for Human \u00a9.

You and I, who are looking ahead to the future monster. We talk about synthetic reproduction. You say that it shouldn't be called reproduction but synthetic production\u2014the fabrication of an entirely new species. A species made up of post-Jews and post-Catholics, a spe-cies that will come after the current bifurcated sexuality of either being homo or hetero, guy or girl. We're realistic. We'll have to begin by filtering the HIV out of your sperm. You say that all those procedures cost too much and that we can't afford the analyses, filtration, freezing, insemi-nation. We could ask for a grant from the Centre national du livre, explaining that we're planning to write a political memoir on the process of genetic recombination of your infected sperm and my dyke-trans ova. Considering the number of liters of sperm you've ejaculated up to this day, we could, conceivably, inseminate half the planet. If you'd sold your sperm before becoming HIV positive, you'd have had enough money now to pay for filtration and insemina-tion. Or we could buy back an uncontaminated sample of your sperm. But before you got HIV , spreading your genes probably wouldn't have been of interest to you. We talk about filtering your sperm to separate the spermatozoids that are carrying the HIV virus from the others. Separating the weak cells from the strong ones. The bad from the good. I know you hate me for considering the possibility of filtra-tion, even if you're the one who's insisting that we do it like that. You hate me because I'm incapable of wanting that sick sperm as it is, incapable of jerking you off right away and putting your contaminated sperm into my vagina; you hate 240 T esto- ma niame because, like you, I'm afraid of dying. What would hap- pen if it was one of your spermatozoids infected with AIDS that contained the gene of the future savior of the planet? We ask ourselves if desire, need, obsession, shame at filter - ing your semen are eugenist, if a possibility for life should be eliminated because it carries a deadly virus. Yes, such a desire is eugenist\u2014it is\u2014and deep down, neither you nor I can bear the idea of reproduction. Not from your lineage, or from mine. Fatherhood and motherhood are always a com-promise between a form of Nazi eugenics and a compulsion for repetition. But which is the most eugenicist? Producing something good technologically, or letting life fight bare-knuckled with death until one of them wins? In the last analysis, if one of your spermatozoids that carried the virus succeeded in fertilizing one of my ova, if our chromosomes ended up recombining and the cell that was formed in that way managed to divide and form a blastomere that could be implanted in my testosterone-infused uterus, then we would be obliged to think of these two gametes as having passed the test of life. The body that will come to save the planet really could arise from such a monstrous and absurd act, from the opportunity for your seropositive spermato-zoids to swim to the life hidden in my mutant body.

I spot you again walking Justine in the parc des Buttes-Chaumont: behind a bush, your form, the same way of wearing jeans, the same tuft of thick black hair poking over the neck of your white T-shirt. Your ghost rummages through my memory and digs out what it finds: you're calling me. I see the letters of your name appearing in bright blue on the black screen of my telephone. I don't answer it. I wait for you to leave a mes - sage. It's your voice. Your voice, that's the strongest. And it says, \"Hey, hellooo, Preciado, why aren't you taking my call? You're pissing me off, OK?

You couldn't care less about me. I don't know how to answer. \"You really are a son of a bitch. A real asshole.\" I say to you, \"Yeah, and next you'll be the one who brings me paper and pencils in prison so I can keep writing radical books.\" Son of a bitch. You want to get this over with. You lay it on thick. \"Don't think you're so important. What's going on here is that you don't have the balls to write.\" I answer that what I want to write about is the history of the transvestite movement in the 1970s, the history of radical feminist lesbians, of the revolutionary Gay Libera-tion Front, the \"red dykes\" and \"commando saucisson,\" the petroleuses , transvestites, and transsexuals around which the political sex movement in France arose. The camionneu - ses and the girls around Hocquenghem. I tell you that I've met Herv\u00e9 and that he's kept a lot of the archives from that period, and that I've also run into three dyke grannies, who are beginning to lose their memories. That almost all the others are dead. That it has to be done quickly, because soon there will be nothing left. You barely look at me while I'm talking to you; you with- draw, doodle planets in your notebook. I inform you that I'm going to need a few bucks. That it's not going to be the Testo- ma nia 243way it was with the other book. That four hundred euros barely pays for the ink cartridges. You say, \"You're looking for trouble, you're asking for it.\" You say, \"I mean, shit, what could you have to say about this queer stuff?\" You say you thought I wasn't like the other chicks, and that for me it was all about fucking, but now you realize that I'm like the other lesbians, ready to become the politi-cal nurse for anyone I meet. I answer, I'm not a lesbian, I'm trans, a boy, that the fact that I don't have a shitty biocock like yours doesn't mean that I'm not a guy. I tell you, Stop treating me like cow shit just because you take me for a girl. You tell me I bother you, that you're ashamed for me, that I shouldn't count on you publishing that fag stuff, that it would be a better idea for me to call T\u00eatu and write an arti- cle. You burst out laughing. I don't want to contradict you. I don't want to get mad at you, because if you don't publish my books, who will? But I hate you for speaking to me that way. The last time I see you alive. We're dining at Tim and Philippe's place. You want to give me an old parka that belongs to you. You're laughing as you tell me that it's a good style for eighties lesbians. You're a piece of shit. You tell me, and as for you, you're finished.

Perhaps because you and I haven't reproduced the savior of our planet, lately, since you died, I catch myself wishing for the end of the human species. Not its progress, its bet - terment, but merely the end, a break in our chain of being. Your death is the sign of the arrival of what certain scien-tists call the \"sixth extinction.\" 2 Everything begins with bacteria, more than twenty-seven billion years ago: after the explosion of the water molecule, which produced the hydrogen needed for the formation of their cellular com-ponents, bacteria produced a large quantity of oxygen. This same oxygen, which in principal was highly toxic, corrosive, and inflammable, changed the composition of the planet's 2. Niles Eldredge, Life in the Balance: Humanity and the Biodiversity Crisis (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2000), 171-76.Testo- ma nia 245atmosphere and permitted animal life to appear on earth on a large scale. The first extinction, a vast glaciation that exterminated nearly all marine life, took place 435 million years ago. Bacteria survived, and with them their system of producing oxygen. A million years later, in the second extinction, a large portion of fish and marine invertebrates disappeared again. Bacteria survived again. Another million years later, most underwater and terrestrial species were wiped out during the most extreme of all the extinctions. Bacteria survived. Two hundred and ten million years ago, a good number of aquatic species succumbed once more, and the extinction of the first mammals inaugurated the dino-saur period. Sixty million years ago, the fifth extinction caused the disappearance of the dinosaurs. Once more, bac - teria survived. Gradually, small mammals spread over the continental plates, which were adrift, and the fish began populating the oceans again. I'm unsure how to choose between killing myself; becoming a serial killer; devoting my life to the trans-moral development of humanity as a species and its intentional mutation; and forming a trans-feminist army whose mission would be to do in everything opposed to it, without distinction. And all that on behalf of love and planetary charity. Gradually, I'm learning to appreciate your idea of universal HIV contamination as the aesthetic culmination of the punk destiny of our species.

Politics interests me in the same way that the virus is strongly interested by the epidemic. The issue of feminism interests me in the same way that the earth is interested by bacteria. Challenging rigid constructions of gender and fossilized forms of sexuality can be accom-plished only through viral proliferation, at the same time as through bacterial survival. On all fronts, in all spaces. My body: the body of the multitude. addiCTiVe Frus TraT i O n I would have liked to have fallen into a dependence, have the security of permanently and chemically clinging to some-thing. Deep down, I was hoping that testosterone would be that substance. To be attached, not to a subjectivity, but to the change produced by the ingestion into my organism of a substance without will. Depending on no one for that ingestion. Confronting my wish for an object that has no wish. My desire for an object that does not desire. Know - ing that the terms of the deal are between an inanimate substance and me. Knowing that in the outside world there exists a molecule capable of integrating with my emotional metabolism and freeing me from weight, sound, taste, and the color of pure reality. Until now, I haven't been able to become dependent on anything. Not tobacco, or coke, or heroin\u2014nothing. I wonder if I could have become hooked Testo- ma nia 247on testosterone. What I am certain of is that, on the molec - ular level, the battle of addiction has already begun. I wake up next to her. Before opening my eyes, I hear her voice. She's telling me a story about being straight. Every morning, girls give their men blowjobs to satisfy them, so they won't sleep around. Girls' blowjobs are performative: they produce masculinity for the men they are supposed to suck, I answer. She slides a leg between my two, positions her head above my pelvis and sticks her tongue into my sex. She talks to me about the difficulty for a woman who has, until now, been heterosexual in detecting excitement in a body that lacks a biocock. She says, \"How to be sure that the other desires you?\" I've never thought about it. An erect cock makes it easier to decode desire. An erect cock seems to say, \"You're getting me hard, I'm going to screw you, ejaculate.\" She tells me how frustrated she was the first time she made love with a woman. She says that now she understands men better, their fragility when encounter - ing a kind of desire that lacks any visible anatomical signs, that in dealing with a body without an erectile biocock, it's always possible that you're wrong about thinking you detect excitement, that you're being misled by your senses. It's as if language could be dissociated from anatomy with bodies deprived of an easily visible erectile appendix. (\"I'm attracted to you, you're exciting me, but no one but me is privy to that excitement, you won't know anything about it, you won't be able to detect it against my will.\") In bodies without a visible erectile appendix, desire exists 248 T esto- ma nia4.

Otto Weininger, Sex and Character: An Investigation on Fundamental Principles, eds. Daniel Steuer and Laura Marcus, trans. Ladislaus L\u00f6b (Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 2005). within a poetic space of indeterminacy, a sexual jurisdic - tion that expresses itself as internalized knowledge before becoming visible. Strangely, heterophilosophy's patriarchs, Nietzsche 4 and Otto Weininger,5 deemed this territory belonging to femininity as the space where nonknowledge, pretense, and falsehood could be located. It would be more appropriate to speak of a hyperconsciousness, a form of knowledge having the power to decide whether it does or does not wish to express itself through representation. This knowledge of desire before it becomes detectable as an erection unlocks the possibility of sex as fiction, as potenti-ality. In lesbian sexuality, the signs of excitement are deci-phered on an extensive anatomical cartography: the glance, the movement of the hands, the accuracy of touch, the mouth's degree of openness, the amount of sweat or wet - ness. I remember that the first time I fucked a cis-guy, his cock seemed like a secondary object endowed with involun-tary motivity, its functioning was supposed to be a trust - worthy indicator of desire or excitement. On the contrary. I had the impression of being in the presence of a signifying impostor, a biopolitical ancestral leftover whose presence only overshadowed the place where desire really emerges.Testo- ma nia 249TesTO-Mania One's relationship to testosterone changes as soon as one leaves the framework of a medical and legal protocol for changing sex. In the medical protocol, changing sex implies making a unique decision, a choice made once and once only. But things are more complex than that. I don't want to change my sex, and I don't want to declare myself dysphoric about whatever it may be; I don't want a doctor to decide how much testosterone a month is suitable for changing my voice and making me grow a beard; I don't want to have my ovaries and breasts removed. Even if I do not want to procreate, I don't want my reproductive cells to be hijacked by the state; I don't want my uterus to be confiscated by the medical-industrial complex. There is no predefined direc - tion for the changes in me that are triggered by testoster - one. What I do know is that, before testosterone, my voice was not a woman's voice, my beardless face not a woman's face, my clitoris, measuring less than two centimeters, not a female organ. Simply because femaleness is a biopoliti-cal fiction, a variable within a power regime that cannot be derived from anatomical form or reproductive function, I don't need permission from the Spanish monarchy or the French Republic to do up some testosterone. I lay claim to the irreducible plurality of my living body, not to my body as \"bare life,\" but to the very materiality of my body as political site for agency and resistance. The problem is as follows: outside the institutional con- text defined by the state, testosterone is no longer part of 250 T esto- ma niaa therapy of hormonal substitution and becomes an illegal drug, just like cocaine or heroin. The consequences\u2014in legal and medical terms\u2014of my rejection of the protocol must therefore be admitted: I'm addicted to testosterone. My relationship with V could be defined in this way: Depen- dent on Despentes. My relationship with T could be defined in this way: T-dependent. Even when I'm with the two of them. Especially when I'm with them. Hooked . It becomes obvious that my relationship with V belongs to the type of codependency categorized under the sign of addiction. Dependence . I've found my drug, and it is, like all drugs, available and elusive at the same time. You could say that any kind of love relationship is addictive in a certain way. But I don't believe that. It wasn't like that for me the other times. I know from experience that there are forms of love that function according to the model of a satisfying form of feedback. Why am I certain that this love, this and not another, corresponds to the addiction model and not to a cybernetic mechanism of satisfaction? First of all, because there is a dissymmetrical relationship between the inges - tion of, or the presence of, the object of desire and satis - faction. Second of all, because that satisfaction takes the form of withdrawal. Right where satisfaction is supposed to take place, frustration emerges. When I'm kissing her, I think I want to kiss her; when I'm talking with her, I think I have an urgent need to talk with her. When it spills out across my skin, I think I want it to spill out across my skin; and when my body absorbs it, I think I want to absorb it, Testo- ma nia 251more and more. The present moment, the instant of assim- ilation, has no importance compared with the overween-ing necessity for what must come immediately after. More, more, as quickly as possible. A moment later, desire will be still more intense, and on and on, more and more. Desire doesn't destroy itself. It transforms itself, changing into an unconscious state during fatigue or sleep. I desire to con-tinue desiring, without any possibility of satiation. Few substances have led me beyond this threshold of addiction. Alcohol has never interested me. During one period, I took crystal: megapower for the brain. I spoke French fluently, in one night, thanks to an overdose of crystal. Perhaps my accent wasn't changed, but my ability to use vocabulary and my relationship with grammar were radically improved; it was like attaining a new level of consciousness in a foreign language. Efficient, but not to be used regularly. I barely use coke, or Ecstasy or speed; or rather, I use them very rarely, only for those times when I go back to Barcelona or Madrid (when you're passing through metropolitan Spain, a cer - tain toxicological dose is absolutely necessary), and only in those cases. These are city drugs, with the appropriate molecular charge for cohabiting and communicating in a specific urban location. My metabolism has never accepted any substance meant as a compensatory substitution. My only drugs, in all their romantic or anonymous variations, are testosterone and sex, which form, in that way, a circle of mutual production. Both of them affect me inasmuch as their being likely to put me in contact with the amorphous, with the formless, or with that which imagines a form in place of formlessness, that which produces desire without 252 T esto- ma niaany possible satisfaction. Gender identity, or pleasure are beyond the ken of the possible. Today, without realizing it, we're sliding into one of those abysses into which we regularly fall every ten or twelve days. Between two doses of T. Such cyclical alien-ation could become one of our routines, a key to stability. Through these microbreakups, which are forms of preven-tative distancing, our symptomatically addictive relation-ship destroys and regenerates itself. To be more precise, it should be said that she is the one who descends, alone, into these depressions, dragging me along with the child-like hyperactive eyes of an inconsolable rocker, who's no longer sure exactly whether she has just killed someone or learned that she's going to be murdered. The sadness in her eyes is located precisely in the tension between these two possibilities. I've identified her as the driving force of such downward movement, but perhaps it's actually I who reach the bottom, leading her there with a maximum amount of enthusiasm, kindness. Such depths are by necessity liquid; she weeps, plunges into a hot bath, starts doing a wash. It's a pre-fetal, pre-sexual, premature sadness. The day this happens is the same day I have to go for a blood test. Deep down, something is flowing, circulating within a circum-scribed space, but it can spread. On this stratum, feelings exist in their gelatinous state, just before the evaporation and transformations of carbon solutions into electric cur - rents. Such is the state of blood, water, sperm, vaginal secretions, saliva, urine, rachidian and amniotic solutions, the infusion in which the brain floats; but also what one has just ingested, the gel, and exterior nourishment for the Testo- ma nia 253body during the process of gastric assimilation, before it's transformed into fecal matter. To fall in love, Derrida said, is falling into a precise topography, rising by detachment or utter dejection to a particular stratum of being, body, city, planet, evolution, species. This is where the conver - sion of scale occurs: love of being, carnal love, urban love, earthly love, geological love, animal love, interspecies love. It isn't the place to conceive of a Heideggerian rictus, in any way. I'm talking about an architecture. Not a revela-tion, an unveiling of being by some precise inspiration, or making the real emerge in spotlit clarity. That isn't what I'm talking about. I'm talking about a tactile perception, occurring in darkness, about thumping the bottom with your stomach, crawling on a viscous mass. No illumination, but feeling around in the dark. I'm talking about discover - ing the surface of an interiority with your skin. It's a mat - ter of returning to cyberreptilian life, a regression, tasting the electrically viscous truth of being, with small strokes of your tongue. No more long inhalations, because you haven't arrived at the state where being is given to us in its ethereal form. We have no other solution than to lick at being. Suck it, as the sole mode of knowledge and appre-hension. It is here that the secret of addiction reveals its arithmetic. There is neither light nor oxygen, no means of respiration of being, no possibility of finding any optical or pulmonary satisfaction. It's a question of diameter, texture, and fluidity. The moment we end up in one of these gelati-nous lower depths, getting out is as difficult for her as it is for me. There is the same degree of anxiety, the same sad-ness. When it comes down to it, there are no levels, because 254 T esto- ma niathe bottom is just that: the bottom. We're imprisoned in a monad, a single unit. Finding how to get out means, purely and simply, changing the ground, solidifying lique-fied feelings to get a foothold, or evaporating them so you can breathe. It's the time for understanding that the tran-substantiation of affect won't happen today, and the only recourse is to call AS. No one is faster than he is. He comes for the first time on the last day of the year 2005, to put an end to one period and inaugurate another. He responds to the call like a doctor to an emergency, in less than ten min-utes. He's in charge of several musical genres: rock, heavy metal, hip-hop, Afro-Brazilian fusion. He devotes a little of his free time to subduing addictions, at home, in record time. His arrival immediately changes the muddy ground on which we're dawdling. He rings the doorbell, Justine barks, and as soon as he enters the apartment, every - thing slowly becomes lighter. AS likes to talk, and he's wise enough to put on a film or play some music in the back - ground, something that serves as a grid for verbal disori-entation. The doorbell rings again. PE and EN are bringing a new guitar that needs its strings changed. Then PE takes off a pair of smoke-gray glasses, asks EN for a pair of pliers, goes into a rant against Papa Roach, breaks into \"Take My Money,\" mocking the melody, and cuts the strings one by one. The fibers snap, like old electric snakes that could tear your head off. Like a blind person, PE caresses the guitar. Brings his face close to it, passes his fingers over it, insists on a maximum of closeness between his skin and the neck of the guitar. The new strings undulate between his fingers like young cobras rearing up, seem to find the holes in the Testo- ma nia 255pegs by themselves. The snakes recognize the touch of rock, find their way to the music. He attaches them with preci-sion, and without looking; it's impossible to imagine a more perfect compassion, a more sincere devotion than that existing between the strings and his fingers. AS prepares a joint made of pure pot and begins talking. I lock myself in the bathroom to apply a dose of T. V puts on a documentary about the Monterey Pop Festival; Janis Joplin's voice opens up a universal channel of musical vibration, and, suddenly, love becomes breathable. Trans Or junkie? This is how things appear, and it's going to be necessary to face them: if I don't accept defining myself as a transsexual, as someone with \"gender dysphoria,\" I must admit that I'm addicted to testosterone. As soon as a body abandons the practices that society deems masculine or feminine, it drifts gradually toward pathology. My biopolitical options are as follows: either I declare myself to be a transsexual, or I declare myself to be drugged and psychotic. Given the cur - rent state of things, it seems more prudent to me to label myself a transsexual and let the medical establishment believe that it can offer a satisfying cure for my \"gender identity disorder.\" In that case, I'll have to accept having been born in a biobody with which I don't identify (as if the body could be a material given that is there before lin-guistic or political action) and claim that I detest my body, my reproductive organs, and my way of getting an orgasm. 256 T esto- ma niaI'll have to rewrite my history, modify all the elements in it that belong under the narrative of being female. I'll have to employ a series of extremely calculated falsehoods: I've always hated Barbie dolls, I'm repulsed by my breasts and my vagina, vaginal penetration makes me sick, and the only way I can have an orgasm is with a dildo. All this could be partly true and partly nonsense. In other words, I'll have to declare myself mentally ill and conform to the criteria established by the DMS-IV, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, of the Ameri-can Psychiatric Association, in which, beginning in 1980, transsexuality was designated as a mental illness, just like exhibitionism, fetishism, frotteurism, masochism, sadism, transvestism, voyeurism . . . just like almost everything that isn't straight reproductive sexuality and its binary gen-der system. If I refuse to accept that medical classification, I am entering the world beyond redemption known as psycho-sis. Or rather, I should say that I must choose between two psychoses: in one (gender identity disorder), testosterone appears as a medicine, and in the other (addiction), testos - terone becomes the substance on which I am dependent, a dependence that must be treated by other means. I have fallen into a political trap; the problem is that this trap has the same form as my subjectivity: it is my own politi-cal body. How could we have entrusted the state with the management of desire, sexual fantasy, the material sense of embodiment? Am I a body? Or should one say, Am I the body-of-the-state? If I self-administer certain doses of tes - tosterone and run the risk of increasing my facial pilosity Testo- ma nia 257and the size of my clitoris, and changing my voice and the size of my vocal fold, without identifying politically and socially as a man, I become, inevitably, nuts. I won't be able to go directly to the pharmacy to get my doses of Testogel. I'll have to ask D to send me one or two boxes from Lon-don or I'll have to buy them on expressdrugstore.com, or on the sports black market, and must take what I'm given. Hopefully, it will be testosterone manufactured in West - ern Europe and not one of those synthetic variations from Eastern Europe for elite athletes and bodybuilders that could set off an episode of tachycardia lasting several days. I'd rather not think about it. This week I'm going to delay the dose. I won't take it before next Wednesday. rain Che Ck Until she'd understood she'd be my bitch someday, she kept her distance, as if taking advantage of her last moments of conditional freedom. At two hundred milligrams of T a week, I find it hard to go three days without fucking. I think about going away to avoid being caught up in her biochemi-cal web. I call her, and I tell her not to worry about infidel-ity, making a decision, loving me back. I'm going to spend two months with D in Los Angeles. I don't actually say the words infidelity, decision , love. I simply say that it would be easier if I left for a while; I'd give her a \"rain check,\" and maybe it would be better like that. D is about to visit J and certainly will be able to find me an apartment to rent in West Hollywood. Over there, I won't have any trouble find-258 T esto- ma niaing testosterone, and I'll be able to talk about it with other trans people who are or are not taking hormones. But I will come back\u2014that's certain. At least back to Europe. I have to go to Barcelona in February, and maybe I'll stop by Paris. She is silent for a moment, then answers that Los Angeles is her favorite city. Talks about the palm trees. I can't con-centrate on what she's saying. My life stretches before me like a path that forks: one branch goes to the palm trees of Los Angeles, the other to V . Two paths interspersed with doses of T. It isn't as if I were paralyzed at the crossroads. No. I'm the one who had the idea of leaving for Los Angeles, the one who invented a way that hadn't existed until then. And I made its first steps, which are, inevitably, leading me away from her. A rain check is an embryo of congealed time, a vital possibility that can be artificially reactivated within a favorable context. It's love as a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu that you can control intentionally. She calls me two days later. She wants to go to the South of France, to Vauvert, write a book about her rape, about the period when she was a prostitute, on why the twenty-first century will or won't be feminist. She wants to go toward the sun. I give in. The arrogance of testosterone has given way in the presence of pure affect. I leave with her. baby Car Cass We travel together to the South. She changes bodies and faces several times a day. I change languages in order to fol-low the flux. She asks me to speak to her in Spanish while Testo- ma nia 259we're fucking. I say into her ear: Lo que tu quieres es que te folle como una perra or Tu piel es tan suave. It doesn't really matter. What gets her hot is my voice in Spanish, she says. I remember days of incredible bliss. When we're together in the car with music playing in the background, when I watch her dancing in the bedroom, when we're walking through the labyrinth of Chartres Cathedral. But everything can shift from one moment to another. Everything changes permanently when she tells me she intends to kill herself at forty. A year ago she spent Christmas with P and M. Now, she says, she is carrying a dead child on her back. She goes about with this weight like the West Indian mothers at Bar - b\u00e8s, except that her child, from P , is dead. She walks around with a minuscule corpse attached to her shoulders. I could cave in, but I don't. I could take her tenderly in my arms, but I don't. I am not a rock star. Stress alters hormonal lev - els. Testosterone changes one's resistance to stress. I need a dose, except that I'm already over my weekly 250 milli-grams. I close down the channels for peripheral thoughts, avoid unhealthy thinking; if she really wanted to kill her - self, she wouldn't wait to turn forty for that. Quid moraris emori . Her suicide was born dead, like her child with P . Post - poned suicide is called depression. If she has a date and a ritual, it's because life still has meaning for her. Because she is VD. If not, she'd kill herself this very day. Tonight. Right here in Vauvert, in the marshes of Camargue. And if it were me, I'd have had it up to here once and for all. I'd open the windows and let the mistral in, I'd open the faucets that fill the tub with hot water, I'd open a box of Lexomil, I'd have a last dose of T, I'd open my mouth and drink, I'd open my 260 T esto- ma niaesophagus as I swallowed, I'd open the veins leading to my heart, I'd open my cells where the poison had to enter, I'd open the chains of carbon and sodium, the opiate recep-tors. For her, the channels leading the soul to the abode of the dead would be opening, and her little one, barely born, would be coming to welcome her. Quite a lovely ending for this story, but she wants to make us wait another four years. So it will be too late. Difficile est longum subito depo- nere amorem . I don't want to listen to her. I don't want to hear her rubbish about P , about the dead child, about her being incapable of love, of love for anything that's not the little corpse. I don't want to. I just want somebody to fuck her, fuck us, fuck all three of our asses to death: her, me, and the dead baby. sarah The path leading from the Vauvert writers' residence to the beach at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer is a paradise of plants over which they've rolled a tongue of asphalt. It's a natu-ral garden inhabited by new technoliving species: beavers, eagles, bulls, white horses, colonies of pink flamingoes, and cars. The cars that glide along that unique gray carpet are cyberpredators longing to eliminate all competition between mobile prehistoric organisms and new ultrar - apid human-machine aggregates. In this cyberparadise of Vauvert, the human-automobile has become a complex organism that consumes and has its habitat, like any other animal. The beavers swim nimbly through the river, plunging under the submerged shrubs, their fur-covered shapes Testo- ma nia 261rippling. And attracted by the metaphysical weight of the other shore, by the challenge of abandoning their aquatic life for dry land, compelled by the temptation of technolog-ical separation, they lift their heads above water and place their first paw on the asphalt. On dry land, their furry bod-ies become clumsy, their tails too heavy; their eyes, still cov - ered by a liquid film, can barely distinguish the other shore. The cars zigzag to try to trap these viscous volumes under their tires. Sometimes they hit them head on, making them burst into blood and guts. The locals accuse beavers of being illegal immigrants (they came from South American rivers and were intro-duced into Europe in the nineteenth century) that indulge in unchecked reproduction, undermining the ecosystem of Camargue. They go to great lengths to eliminate them, piti-lessly. The beaver has something in common with an Arab boy from the Paris area, with the wetbacks from Tijuana, with the Africans who swim to Gibraltar. They cross over to survive. Leave their skin under the wheels. The eagles fly in circles over cars. In such a way, the eagle uses the automo-bile as its hunting prosthesis. After the car has gone by, the beaver, ripped open on the harsh, wintry ground, treats the native eagle to its foreign and exquisite tripe. I don't take photographs of the scene. I don't want to include a camera, the ultimate techno-eye, in this rite of cyber-ecology. The chemical traces left by the eagle and beaver on my memory will be enough. In 1888, Van Gogh spent five days on the beach at Saintes-Maries, at the H\u00f4tel de la poste. He painted four boats without sails or tillers, their keels cast up on a sand 262 T esto- ma niadune, as well as two other boats at full sail, disappearing across the water. On one of the boats, Van Gogh wrote the word Friendship. V and I go almost every day by car to Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer. The church was probably built on the site of an ancient pagan temple dedicated to the Egyptian god Ra, father of the sun. The Saintes Maries de la Mer are two girls in a boat. They seem to be drifting on the gigantic, foamy waves of the Mediterranean, like Van Gogh's small crafts. Each carries between her hands a golden box. But what do they contain? The crypt at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer contains Sarah, also known as Sarah the Black One, Sarah la Kali, Sarah the Nomad, the black servant of the Saint Maries, or an Egyptian goddess; Sarah, the patron saint of the gypsies. V and I go down to see her. We're carrying two empty urns. Sarah is a black porcelain head peeking out from more than fifty red, green, white, and blue gowns bordered with gold thread. Her black hair disappears beneath the gowns, and they transform the statue into an enormous article of clothing of a thousand layers on which lies a head crowned with gilded and crystalline brilliants. In her urn, V carries the child that she didn't have with P . In the form of a relic, I carry the cock that I didn't need to cut off in order to be who I am, the same one that I will have no need to graft onto me to be who I am. There are not two sexes, but a multiplicity of genetic, hormonal, chromosomal, genital, sexual, and sensual configurations. There is no empirical truth to male or female gender beyond an assemblage of normative cultural fictions.Testo- ma nia 263In the eyes of Van Gogh, the plain of Camargue lead- ing to the Saintes-Maries resembled a Dutch landscape, but under a different light. I have the impression that it is the light of Spain shining on another plain, the same Egyptian sun that warms the backs of the immigrant beavers from the third millennium.264 T esto- ma nia265I sell frustration, not relief. \u2014LYDi a Lun Ch The pOrnOgraphi C iMpera T i V e: Fu C k yO u yO ursel F 1. Pornography is a masturbatory virtual device (literary, audiovisual, cybernetic . . . ). In its capacity as a cinematic industry, the goal of pornography is planetary multimedia masturbation. The pornographic image is characterized by its capacity to stimulate\u2014independently of the spec - tator's will\u2014the biochemical and muscular mechanisms that regulate the production of pleasure. Emphasizing the pornographic image's capacity to become activated in the body of the spectator, Linda Williams defined pornography as \"embodied image,\" an image that incorporates itself as body and captures the body at the \"encounter with an eroti-cized technological apparatus.\" 110.

It is sexuality transformed into public representation, where public refers directly or indi-rectly to becoming \"marketable.\" Given the conditions of post-Fordist capitalism, a public representation implies an ability for exchange on the global market in a digital form that can be transformed into capital. A representation acquires pornographic status when it transforms into \"pub-lic\" that which is supposed to remain private. Therefore, we will speak of pornography as a device for the publication of the private. Or, even better, a device that, representing part of public space, thereby defines it as private while load-ing it with an added masturbatory value. The word porno - graphic refers to an economic-political characterization of representation. 3. Pornography is tele-techno-masturbation. The globaliza- tion of the pharmacoporno economy by means of audiovi-sual digitization and its ultrafast transmission, using a host of technical media (television, computer, telephone, exter - nal data storage devices such as pods, pads, etc.), generates a butterfly effect in the global management of the cycles of excitation-frustration-excitation: a pussy opening in one place, a mouth sucking in another, producing hundreds of releasings of pleasure at the other end of the world as their virtual displacement emits a living flow of capital. 4. Pornography has the same characteristics as any other spectacle of the culture industry: performance, virtuosity, dramatization, spectacularization, technical reproducibil-266 P ornpowerity, digital transformation, and audiovisual distribution. The only difference for the moment rests in its underground status. The porn producer David Friedman remarked that contemporary pornographic exploitation, conceived as a performative practice and audiovisual consumption, is an extension of the popular circus, the freak shows at fairs, and the amusement parks of the pre-cinematic era. 2 Por - nography and prostitution could be regarded as fields of the industry of the spectacle, condemned to ostracism and illegality during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The modification of the aberrant, perverse, or deviant (dis - abled, freak, homosexual, nymphomaniac, whore . . . ) body from the status of carnival attraction to that of the men-tally ill or criminal typical of the disciplinary biopolitical regime will accentuate this process of exclusion from public and economic domains. 5. The relationship of the pornographic industry to the industry of culture and the spectacle is equivalent to the relationship of traffic in illegal drugs to the pharmaceutical industry. It represents two of the covert engines of capi-talism of the twenty-first century. Pharmacopornographic production functions on ambivalence: it is a marginal and hidden aspect of the contemporary cultural industry, but it is also a paradigm for all other types of post-Fordist produc - tion. Within \u00fcbermaterial capitalism, all forms of produc - tion offer benefits to the extent to which they approach the model of pharmacopornographic production. 2. David Friedman, porn producer: \"The pornographic exploitation business was an extension of the circus carnival\u2014girlie shows, freak shows, gambling games, rides, ballyhoo, hullabaloo . . .\" Legs McNeil, Jennifer Osborne and Peter Patvia, The Other Hollywood: The Uncensored Oral History of the Porn Film Industry (New York: ReganBooks, 2005), 1.Pornpower 2676. As an underground sector, the sex industry reveals the truth about all other aspects of the communications and entertainment industry. Literature, film, television, the Internet, comics, video games, and so on want pornogra-phy, wish to produce pleasure and pornographic surplus value without having to suffer the marginalization that comes with pornographic representations, in the same way that contemporary producers of the legal pharmaceutical industry want to produce pleasure and sexual (addiction) and toxicological surplus value without suffering the mar - ginalization and criminalization that come with doing busi-ness in illegal drugs. 7. In pornography, sex is performance , which is to say that it is composed of public representations and processes of rep- etition that are socially and politically regulated. Let's look again at the relationship between the industry of culture and the industry of sex. Judith Butler defined gender, mas - culinity, and femininity in terms of performances, regulated processes of repetition, norms internalized in the form of bodily style, representation, and public dramatization. 3 In a parallel vein, in the 1980s, Annie Sprinkle introduced a new performative shift in the understanding of identity by defining not only gender, but also sexuality, in terms of performance. 4 For Sprinkle, the truth of sexuality that por - nographic representation claims to capture is merely the effect of a system of representation, an array of corporal choreographies regulated by gender codes of representa- 3.

It follows that, for Sprinkle, pornography has no empirical or docu-mentary value outside of a given system of representation. 8. The distinctive feature of pornography as image has more to do with issues of scenography, dramatization, and light than with content; it's enough for a body (whether natural or artificial, \"living\" or \"dead,\" human or animal) to be very well lit, 5 and as desirable as it is inaccessible, possessing a masturbatory value directly proportional to its ability to act as an abstract and dazzling fantasy. 9. The popular view of pornography as degree zero of rep- resentation is based on a sexotranscendental sovereign necro-political principle that we could call \"spermatic Pla-tonism,\" and for which ejaculation (and death) is the only real thing. Foucault pointed out that sovereign (masculine, theological, monarchic) power was characterized by not the power of giving life but the power of giving death. From that standpoint, snuff is the ontocinematic model of this type of pornographic production: filming the real , the ejacu- lation, death in real time, and even better, making onto-cinematic death and ejaculation coincide. The peculiarity of the dominant form of pornography is its tendency to produce the visual illusion of irruption within the purely real. Pornographic excitation is structured according to the boomerang: pleasure-in-the-desubjectification-of- watching a subject that can't control the force of its sexual production ( potentia gaudendi ) and seeing it at the very moment it renounces that force, to the benefit of an all-powerful spectator (oneself, the person who is watching) who, in turn, and through the representation, sees him- or herself desubjectified, reduced to a masturbatory response. The one watching is pleasured by his or her own process of desubjectification . If we consider the fact that the goal of all pornographic visual material is to make represented ejacu-lation coincide with the spectator's ejaculation (understood in the abstract as a cis-male, the universal visual ejacula-tor), we should be able to conclude that the pleasure of the pornographic eye resides in a cruel contradiction. On one hand, the spectator receives the impression\u2014by means of the desubjectification of the porn actors\u2014that he's the one who possesses the potentia gaudendi of the actors; on the other hand, the body of the spectator is being reduced to an involuntary receiver of ejaculatory stimuli, thereby put - ting him in a position deprived of any power to make sexual decisions. The distinctive feature of pornographic subjec - tivity is the visual swallowing of its own sperm, the fact of simultaneously being both a universal erect cock and a uni-versal receiving anus; and this is something that points us toward a pornosophic precept: pornete ipsum. 10. Pornography tells the performative truth about sexu- ality. It is not the degree zero of representation. Rather, it reveals that sexuality is always performance , the public 270 P ornpowerpractice of a regulated repetition, a staging as well as an involuntary mechanism of connection to the global circuit of excitation-frustration-excitation. Today's entertainment industry, with its division of representation into categories, such as \"G\" (general audience\u2014all ages admitted) or \"NC-17\" (no children under seventeen admitted) denies the per - formative value of pornography by reducing it to \"hardcore sex,\" as if\u2014from a theatrical point of view\u2014there were an ontological difference between a kiss, a brawl, and anal pen-etration. The current hegemony of the nonpornographic cultural industry stems from this moral axiom that labels organs considered sexual (in particular, the cock, pussy, and anus) as extra-cinematic objects (literally ob-scene, or \"out - side the scene\") whose value as \"truth\" cannot be absorbed by representation and transformed into performance. But behind this hegemony hides the cultural industry's wish to affect the techno-organic centers of the production of subjectivity (centers for the production of pleasure, affect, a feeling of omnipotence and comfort) with the same effi-ciency as pornography. The cultural industry is porn envy . Pornography isn't simply a cultural industry like others; it's the paradigm for all cultural industries. 6 Pornography\u2014 which sexualizes production and converts the body into information\u2014and its closed circuit of excitation-capital- 6. This assertion shouldn't be confused with the often-debated Fredric Jameson maxim that \"every image is pornographic.\" In this case, Jameson is employing a critical definition of pornography as a way of describing the \"ideological\" status of the image, faced with the radical truth of the historical text in the Marxist sense of the term; cf. Fredric Jameson, Signatures of the Visible (New York: Routledge, 1990), 1.Pornpower 271frustration-excitation-capital provide in a particularly clear way a key to understanding any other type of post-Fordist cultural production. 11. When it comes to critical reactions, the traps are more numerous than the points of escape. Taking sexuality out of the framework of production and work (paid or not) isn't enough to free it from contemporary biopolitical control, not any more than entrusting its regulation to the state would be. It would be impossible to go back to the roman-ticism of a nonpublic sexuality, or to attain a private and nonindustrialized body. And free market undertakings, whether emancipatory or abolitionist, would fail as well. From now on, in fact, it's a matter of inventing other com-mon, shared, collective, and copyleft forms of sexuality that extend beyond the narrow framework of the domi-nant pornographic representation and standardized sexual consumption. In 1990, Annie Sprinkle opened the way by using the term postpornography to present The Public Cervix Announcement, a performance during which she invited the audience to explore the inside of her vagina with the help of a speculum. Such a representation of sex is a critique of the codes of visibility produced by medicine and by tradi-tional pornography. To the \"truth of pornographic sex\"\u2014to allude to Foucault's expression\u2014Sprinkle opposes the theatrical and artistic production of multiple sex fictions. And Sprinkle's scheme has proliferated in the work of oth-ers: Shelly Mars, Fatal Video, Virginie Despentes and Cor - alie Trinh Thi, Del LaGrace Volcano, Maria Beatty, Bruce LaBruce, Shu Lea Cheang, Post Op, Giuseppe Campuzano, 272 P ornpowerNadia Granados La Fulminante, Porno Porsi, and so on. The common denominator for this great variety of aesthetic and political strategies (postporn, camp, drag king, BDSM, anarchopunk, cyber, queer-indigenous, etc.) is an episte-mological inversion, a radical displacement of the subject of pornographic enunciation: those who had been pas - sive objects of the pornographic and the disciplinary gaze (\"women,\" actors and actresses,\" \"whores,\" etc.) become subjects of repre-sentation, thereby putting in question the (aesthetic and somato-political) codes that make their bodies and sexual practices visible and producing the impression of the natu-ral stability of sexual relations and gender relationships. Such a critique makes a breach in the history of the rep- resentation of sexuality, transforming pornographic tech-niques into a field of political intervention. The pOrniFiCaT i O n OF l ab O r I have no need to remind you\u2014not you, who are reading this book\u2014that the province of sex (and I mean your sex) is not the individual body (your body) or the private domain (your private domain) or any domestic space (your domes - tic space). That not the individual body, or the space called private, or domestic space escape political regulation. Sex, excitation, the demand for erection and ejaculation are at the center of pharmacopornographic political production and economy. Accordingly, the situation can be defined in the following terms: labor sexus est. In the cyberextended Pornpower 273pharmacopornographic city, the material process of work depends on a collection of sexual tractions, psychosomatic instincts, hormonal escalations, the establishment of syn-aptic connections, and the emission of chemical excretions. Sex is work. Nevertheless, the object of work is not to sat - isfy, but to excite: setting in motion the somatic mechanism that regulates the excitation-frustration-excitation cycle. We are working at the porn factory: a technosomatic indus - try fueled by sperm, blood, urine, adrenalin, testosterone, insulin, silicone, psychostimulants, and estrogens, but also the digitized signs that can be transmitted at high speed, whether number, text, sound, or image. We call the pornifi-cation of labor the capture of sex and sexuality by economy, the process by which sex becomes work. Thus, in order to understand the praxis of post-Fordist labor, it is necessary to study in detail three domains that, until now, were considered peripheral or marginal to capi-talist cycles of production and consumption: 1. The production, trafficking, and consumption of (legal or ille- gal) drugs. By drug , in this case, I mean what Derrida calls pharmakon : not only every chemical substance of natural or synthetic origin that typically affects the functions of the central nervous system of the living organism, but also, in a larger sense, all biologically active legal or illegal substances that are able to modify the metabolism of the cells on which they work. Texts and visual signs are also pharmakon . 7 7. Some of the principles governing the flow of psychotropes were touched upon in chapter 8 of this book, \"Pharmacopower.\" 274 P ornpower2. The production, circulation, and consumption of audiovisual pornographic materials. By pornography , I mean, in this case, any sexually active audiovisual technique capable of modi-fying the sensibility and production of desire, of activating cycles of excitation-frustration and the production of psy - chosomatic pleasure, in fine, of capturing the body's system of affect production. 3. Sexual labor. The transformation of a body's potentia gau- dendi into a commodity by a contract (more or less formal) of service. The power of these three platforms\u2014drugs, pornographic audiovisual material, sexual services\u2014for the production of capital rests in their ability to function as prostheses of subjectivity. What's being designed here is the logic of a gen - eral pharmacopornographic economy at the heart of which cir - culate organs, pills, financial codes, communication links, images, texts, jerk-off sessions, liters of silicone, chemical compounds, dollars, and so on. The theorists of this new conception of labor as excita- tion will no longer be classical economists (Ricardo, Marx, the pornographers (Candida Royale, Narcis Bosch, Nacho Vidal, HPG, actresses (Annie Sprinkle, Nina Roberts, Coralie Trinh Thi, etc.), sex workers (Michelle Tea, Norma Jane Almodovar, Claire Carthonnet, etc.), and members of drug trafficking net - works, from the producers of coke and the state mafias to Pornpower 275the impoverished workers on opium plantations, as well as herbalists adept at ancestral traditions of witchcraft, phar - maceutical laboratories, petty traffickers, and junkies.

The international guide of pharmacological production of 276 P ornpowerViagra and its underground counterfeiting market will tell us more about the production of excitation-frustration-excitation values in post-Fordist society than will all the classical economic treatises with their obsolete notions of work as mercantile production. sex COpyrigh T: l ewd Te C hn O signi F iers Power experienced slippage; it shifted, throughout the previous century, from the earth to manufacturing, then toward information and life. Today, power extends to sex, gender, and race in their capacity as precise codifications of information and subjectivity. In the near future, it will function through an even more efficient mode by means of its transformation into psychotropic patents that con-trol the production of neurological responses and synthetic hormones. However, desire, sex, and gender resemble nei-ther the earth nor manufactured products. Desire, sex, and gender are, in reality, closer to information as an embodied technosemiotic system (Haraway). They are living codes. Like information, they defy ownership because my pos - session of a fragment (of information, desire, sex, gen-der) doesn't take it away from you. My desire, my plastic cock, my prosthetic masculinity can circulate and be shared without the pleasure becoming any less powerful. It's the opposite, in fact: sharing multiplies desire, sex, and gender. The problem is that, until now, desire, pleasure, sex, and gender were thought of as nontransferable essences or as private property. At first, they were conceived to be fixed Pornpower 277substances in nature; then, as the property of God; then, as that of the state; and later, as private properties; and finally, today, as the property of pharmacopornographic multinationals. The new global corporations produce nothing. Their only goal is the accumulation and management of patents in order to control the (re)production of bodies and pleasures. This politics of copyright , which oversees the sexualizing of production and the conversion of life into information, is what I've called pharmacoporn politics ; its purpose is to transform your ass and mine, or rather, your desire and mine, into abstract profits. Your clitoris and my cock are subjected to the same fate as an ear of corn, given the way that multinationals employ genetic engineering to produce new transgenic strains whose seeds will be infertile. In the same way that the multinationals are currently controlling world production of corn thanks to the privatization of germoplasms, but are also busy\u2014and this is primordial\u2014transforming the entire planet into potential consumers of the new transgenic seeds (which are themselves infer - tile), the pharmacopornographic industry is striving for the exponential control and production of your desiring body. Along with \"the computerization of agriculture,\" 8 we are witnessing a process of the conversion into information of sex and gender, through which capital is seeking to produce and possess narcotic, audiovisual, molecular, and narrative models, all of which serve as regulators of desiring subjec - tivity. Your sex, your desire, and your gender are the new 8. Negri and Hardt, try.

According to Weber's intuition, it wasn't materialism, but the ethics of Protestant life, that permitted the blossom-ing of capitalism. Until then considered punishable by God and a sign of immodest luxury, sacrificing oneself to work and to economic success became proof of one's love for God. God circulated within the body, commodities, and lands by means of capital. Accordingly, the principle regu-lating the production of life and the management of popu-lations in the pharmacopornographic era is not hedonism, the satisfaction of sensual pleasures, but a post-Christian-free-market-punk ethic whose principle is the compulsive reproduction of the excitation-frustration cycle to the point of achieving the total destruction of the ecosystem.Pornpower 279Here is one example of a completely lifelike prosthesis heralding the porno future of Weberian free-market Protes - tantism: Paris Hilton.9 A noticeable exception to the model American beyond reproach, Paris Hilton represents the zenith of the sexopolitical production of the luxury white heterosexual technobitch. The disinherited inheritor of a multimillion-dollar hotel empire and a real estate firm, Hil-ton rejected traditional institutions of apprenticeship and began working on television shows such as The Simple Life and later used her films to market her life in a pharmaco-pornographic way. Hilton didn't abandon Weber's Protes - tant ethic and the spirit capitalism. No: she incorporated it and used it to take it to the highest level of pharmacoporno media production. The vapid Hilton having it off with Herr Weber. Despite her seeming proclivity for vice and idleness, the Paris Hilton phenomenon exhibits no insubordination against the capitalist economy. On the contrary: her entire life and sexuality are being transformed, by devices of extreme surveillance, into work\u2014into digital images that are transferable worldwide. Her triumph is having known how to recover her body and her sexuality as ultimate val-ues on the global-exchange market of pharmacoporno-graphic capitalism. In this sense, Paris Hilton could be a high-tech pharmacopornographic sex worker; and perhaps this worker dimension of her immorality is what disturbs Grandaddy Hilton the most. 9. For more on Paris Hilton as an expression of the porno future that is conscious of class, see Virginie Despentes, King Kong Theory, 99-100. 280 P ornpowerIf Paris Hilton has asserted herself as a paradigmatic fig- ure of the pharmacopornographic mode of production, it isn't\u2014unlike for porn actresses from the 1970s through the 1990s, from Marilyn Chambers to Jenna Jameson\u2014a result of her qualities as a sex bomb. Hilton is radically dif - ferent from traditional porn actresses: she did not come to X-rated films out of economic necessity or an unstoppable social destiny but, on the contrary, decided and planned her transformation into a Google star while relying on her own financial empire. In addition, she generates no signifi-cant masturbatory interest, neither on the physical nor on the performing level, which suggests that, if it weren't for her fortune and a powerful publicity machine, she would never have been able to make any inroads in the porno-graphic market in competition with such actresses as Traci Lords or Katsumi. If the persona of Paris Hilton presents any indisputable theoretical-political interest (outside the masturbatory), it's because she is an illustration of the con-temporary tendency of all forms of work and production of value to transform themselves into pharmacopornographic production, thus indicating a \"porn future\" for the produc - tion of worth in contemporary capitalism as a whole. Under the Puritan values that Weber believed he had identified hide digitized images of the completely waxed vulva of Paris Hilton, the testosterone-infused muscles of Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the worldwide Viagra dosing of limp biococks after their reaching their fifties.Pornpower 281urban sexOdrOMes For the 2005 soccer World Cup, Angela Merkel's German government gave the green light to the building of Artemis, a thirty-two-thousand-square-foot multimedia brothel located at three subway stations of Berlin's Olympic sta-dium, accelerating at the same time the pornification of the city and the Fordization of the sex industry. The inside of the building has a decorative aesthetic that the promot - ers have deemed \"worthy of Las Vegas.\" Endowed with four floors, the complex includes a swimming pool; several saunas; two movie theaters; and a large number of rooms, enough to hold one hundred sex workers and 650 cus - tomers. The German government's reasoning reveals the foundations of today's pharmacopornographic capitalism: \"There's a necessity to offer the four million spectators who are coming to Berlin for the World Cup the best sexual ser - vices possible, just as they'll be offered the best amenities in terms of hotels and restaurants, and the best of our cul-tural and communications services.\" 10 Please note, in pass - ing, that the brothel as a state institution, a public service offered the inhabitants of a city or its visitors by the gov - ernment, is in no way Merkel's invention, but a facility that has existed from the time of the medieval city to the colo-nial establishments of the nineteenth and twentieth cen-turies. For example, in 1434, the municipality of Bern put the public brothels at the disposal of Emperor Sigismond and his court during his visit to the city. In 1769, French 10. Article appearing in the Le Nouvel Observateur (May 4-10, 2006): 13. 282 P ornpowerwriter Restif de la Bretonne argued for the construction of state-run brothels in Europe to regulate the presence of street women in European cities and to prevent the spread of syphilis. Despite the many differences that separate the paleo-urban brothel of Bern, Restif's state brothel, and the sex mall Artemis, all of them have played a decisive role in the biopolitical and economic development of the modern pharmacopornopolis. This \"socceristic\" brothel also falls within the genealogy of the multimedia brothels pioneered by Playboy's hotels and clubs in the United States at the end of the 1950s; it's an example of the building-brothel transformed into a space of production, consumption, dis - tribution of pornographic audiovisual signs, and offers of sexual services and functioning as a \"heterotopia,\" to bor - row Foucault's term\u2014a space of politicosexual exception dominated by laws and values that are in apparent contra-diction with those of the dominant public space. 11 The modern city is a gender- and race-segregated brothel. When a political measure attempts to \"end prostitution in the city,\" what it is really saying is: it's necessary to make what's \"urban\" about this city invisible. And this is equal, as we know, to pushing the city beyond the limits of the city. According to Le Nouvel Observateur, Artemis is intended \"for the hordes of male bachelors and their libido when it has been galvanized by the warfare of soccer.\" However, what characterizes the hordes of potential consumers of the sex - ual services offered by Artemis isn't so much their status as 11. For more on Playboy's multimedia brothels, see Beatriz Preciado, (it's of little importance whether these \"males\" are part of a couple or not before they come to the World Cup), but the fact that they identify sexopolitically as het - erosexual; and this is because these sexual services are to be provided solely and exclusively by forty thousand women coming from every corner of the world (for whom the Euro-pean Economic Union will obtain a temporary work permit for the region during the World Cup). For the occasion, the German government, which recognizes sex work as legal, has published a \"travel guide for the women\" intended for the young girls from the old Soviet bloc who want to work in Germany as prostitutes. In France, Malka Marcovich, the national director of the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women-International, launched a petition\u2014signed by Fadela Amara and S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, \"Buying sex isn't a sport.\" Unsuccessfully\u2014and naively\u2014they tried to convince the German government to prohibit sex commerce during the World Cup. The relationship between sports and prostitution could offer some keys to understanding the contemporary phar - macopornographic regime. Adding ironic understatement to Marcovich's slogan furnishes us with our own: \"Buying sex is a sport.\" On the other hand, if there hadn't been a radical Fordization of the sex industry up until now, we would be able to say that a severe pornification of Ford-ist and cultural industries is at work. Rather than imagin-ing prostitution as a practice on the margins of the soccer industry, we'd have to consider the sport in general, and soccer in particular, as being part of a worldwide pharma-copornographic industry that controls Internet networks; 284 P ornpowerclubs and discotheques; chains of pornographic produc - tion, distribution, and dissemination; pharmaceutical pro- duction industries of anabolic drugs and other molecules that supplement the athletic and sexual body and their marketing; and the chains of production and distribution for music, clothing, accessories, and derived products (such as figurines of Zidane or boxes of condoms). In the milieu of professional sports, as in that of sex work, the problem is not the sale of the body, contrary to the affirmations of abolitionist feminists and Protestant and Catholic fundamentalists. Work in the post-Fordist society is always and in every case the sale of the force of communication and excitation produced by a living body\u2014the sale of that body's potentia gaudendi . And what is spe- cific about any form of pharmacopornographic production is found in the asymmetry of class, gender, race, and dis - ability in the market at hand (nine out of ten sex workers are cis-females, and barely four out of ten are white), as well as the asymmetry of economic remuneration and profes - sional status. Despite the radical differences between Jenna Jame- son's and Thierry Henri's thighs, it's interesting to observe that, quite often, athletes from the major European teams and sex workers engaged to serve soccer fans by Artemis belong to the same worldwide economic, political, and racial stratum: they come from the classes of poor workers or the former colonies of the European nation states, and they make their way through the contemporary pharmaco-pornographic market (winning European residency at the same time) by selling their somatic and affective capital, Pornpower 285their potentia gaudendi . What the German pharmacoporno- graphic industry is making available to the spectators (both the physical and virtual kind) of the World Cup are the erot - icized and sexualized bodies of athletes and sex workers. The process of the pornification of labor, as present in the industry of the spectacle as it is in the sex industry, extracts a pharmacopornographic surplus value from racialized and pauperized bodies (nonwhite bodies from places referred to as \"developing countries\") that have been completely shut out of legal access to the West by any other means. The pharMaCOpOrnOgraphi C wOrker In every period of history, a certain type of work and worker define the form of production that is characteristic of that particular economy. Curiously, the work and the worker in question retrospectively appear as the most endangered, laboring under the most devalued working conditions. It is the body of the cotton-picking male and of the female worker and reproductive slave that defines the economy of the plantation, the body of the female that defines white heterosexual reproduction, the body of the miner that defines the economy of the steam engine, the body of the fungible male or female worker that defines the concentra-tion camp, the body of the male or female factory worker that defines the Fordist economy. The work and specific kind of exploitation that today defines the pharmacopor - nographic economy is sex work, and the paradigmatic body 286 P ornpowerof this model of production is that of the migrating whore, the transgender sex worker, or the porn actress or actor. The difference between ostensible production (the legal production of authorized merchandise) and real produc - tion (the production of excitation-frustration value) is so important in the case of the sex worker that throughout history no other category of producers of capital has been in such a precarious situation, except for the slave work - ers of the plantation economy and the fungible workers of the concentration camp economy. The real, ultrapauper - ized workers of pharmacopornographic capitalism are the whores, the \"unchosen\" emigrants, the petty traffickers, the nonwhite and transgender prisoners, the bodies fated for domestic work and care of the body, and finally, chil-dren and animals (the actual sources of raw materials for pharmacological production\u2014bodies destined to take part in clinical trials or be consumed by the agrifood industries). All of them are just short of citizenship. And just short of being human. Therefore, referring to the \"feminization of work\" to describe contemporary capitalism's transforma-tion of work is not only insufficient but also biased. It is advisable to speak of the pornification of work and the pro-duction of the racialized and transgender body and subjec - tivity in a global pharmacoporno political regime. Until now, sex work and the work of reproduction were considered to be disinterested, the origins of the supposed dignity of the female subject, who would feel completely degraded by the commodification of sexual services. And this is where left-wing theorists of \"the feminization of Pornpower 287labor\" bring up the unpaid services that women have per - formed in history, speaking about the hygiene of people and things, household management, the education of chil-dren, care for the sick and the elderly, the web of networks of cooperation and solidarity, but omitting sexual and reproductive services, which nevertheless are part of this unpaid labor; as if, intentionally or not, they are protecting the domain of sexuality from that of economic production, thereby making it a sacred zone of human activity. But how can it be possible that no one considers the fact that politi-cal responsibilities, school education, or musical creation are the free province of all, whereas we continue to believe that keeping sex work and reproduction free services (in other words, pauperized or politically obligatory services) is equivalent to preserving the essential dignity of women and, to a larger extent, the entire human population? Most analyses of capital's process of transformation chastely avoid the sticky problem of pharmacoporno-graphic production.

Nothing allows us to claim that the new post-Fordist model of work is more \"feminine\" than the industrial model was. Is it possible that women didn't work as slaves in the cotton fields? Is it possible that they weren't the first to pack sardines on an assembly line, or work in the textile industry, or manufacture smart cards for Microsoft? Saying \"feminine\" to describe the pro-gressive casualization of work implies a presupposed het - erocentricity, a metaphysics of sexual difference, and the precondition of a \"rhetoric of gender\" according to which, sure, stable, and permanent implies industrial and male and flexible, changeable, mobile, and precarious implies postin-dustrial and female. Let us think out this gender relationship in terms of the contemporary pornification of work. Describing the current process of the transformation of work in terms of \"feminization\" can only be justified by the fact that it is the virtual or factual production of the cis- or trans-female body and the performance of femininity that makes the worldwide heterocock get hard. But it is also true that an important number of homococks get hard for guys' asses, for other cocks, and for lubricated anuses. Let us add to this the new masturbatory mechanisms working on the bodies of women. Although still underexploited, they could soon constitute a new platform for the production of pharma-copornographic profits. But, to speak more generally, the facts are oozing out in evidence and must be faced: until now, cis-females (and to a lesser degree, some transfemales and certain eroticized cis-males) were the ones who per - formed the task of making the world's cock hard. But noth-Pornpower 289ing indicates or justifies requiring cis-females to continue to take care of it. One of the indices of the degree of exploitation of sex work and pornography is the social immobility of its labor - ers, the impossibility of leaving that domain of production to attain other forms of work that are less pauperized. In the current conditions of production, sex and pornographic work are pushing the ontological force of all relationships of exploitation to its limit. At a time when work is becom-ing flexible and professional reinvention routine, sex work seems to most effectively reduce workers to a natu-ral essence, branding them for the rest of their lives and making employment in other work markets very difficult. Workers in the pharmacopornographic industry are com-parable today to a caste, a cursed species who remain deval-ued for all other work in the legitimate market, despite the short duration of their career in the field of pharmacopor - nographic services (five years on average). I discuss this issue with Nina Roberts, preeminent French porn-terrorist actress. According to her analysis, \"Certain porn actresses fatten up to a high degree when they stop making films, to avoid being recognized and to desexualize themselves, so they can go out and do their shopping without being taken for sluts in heat looking for hard cocks.\" The thought crosses my mind that it would be easier for them to take testosterone and change genders. That way, they could transform themselves into courte-ous and anonymous customers, with hairy arms and low voices. Such a metamorphosis would be a form of political indemnification: a cultural reparation for having served in 290 P ornpowerthe formation of your basic Hairy Arm heterosexual mas - turbator. No one would ever guess that a bitch in heat could be hidden behind the features of an anonymous porn con-sumer and treat herself to possession of the dominant gaze, for only a few milligrams of testosterone a month during a period of barely six months. Strangely, such an unheard-of transformation would simultaneously grant attainment of the place of the hegemonic subject of representation and the luxury of pornographic invisibility. A change in gender could also be envisioned as an occasion for a comeback of a career in porn, which is normally so short for cis-females. If we take into account the fact that the professional path of an X-rated actress is becoming ever shorter (it being rare to remain under the spotlights beyond the age of twenty-five), we can imagine Mandy Bright, Jesse Jane, Jenna Jameson, or Nina Hartley after their mastectomies, armed with \"real-skin\" suction-cup dildos, size XL, starting new careers as delightful dandies of porn who'd usurp all the Roccos and the Nachos . . . I'll refrain from a stream of commentaries on the pharmacopornographic pleasure there'd be in seeing a technoharder version of Nina Roberts having it off with all the porn stars. For the moment, the restriction of prostitution from the category of work as it is defined by unions and laws to which government institutions in the West subscribe (with a few near exceptions that we can view as testing grounds of political dissidence) and the control of the circuits of pro-duction and distribution of pornography, which prevents pornography's assertion as a cinematic industry equal to any other branch of entertainment, are not the result of a Pornpower 291desire to protect the rights of women facing objectification of their body on the market, which various voices from the left, the right, and feminism have claimed in unison. On the contrary. If it seems to be necessary (in right-wing as well as left-wing discourses) to deny that sex can be the object of work, of economic exchange, services, or contracts, it is because the potential opening of the category of work puts into question the so-called Puritan values of the spirit of capitalism, or even worse, makes visible the real porn val-ues inherent in them. Thus, what is at stake here is a particular way of avoiding the public emergence of the true engines of pharmacopor - nographic capitalism, of avoiding, by any means, the social panic generated by the following revelation: it isn't rational-ity and production, but potentia gaudendi , that sustains the world economy. And this is a panic that would trigger the total dislocation of work as a fundamental value of modern societies. Panic in admitting that behind the economy of the steam engine and Fordism hid and emerged the giant war-porn-drug-prison industrial complex. \u00dcbermaterial labOr The inheritors of Italian operaismo are debating among one another about the degree to which cognitive or \"immate-rial\" work is truly immaterial. Perhaps they haven't made enough references to the movement of their hands along 292 P ornpowerthe length of their erect members while masturbating as they look at porn webpages over Wi-Fi on their cell phones, or the dampness between their legs, the stickiness of their secretions. Virno prefers to call immaterial work \"linguis - tic,\" whereas Hardt and Negri, opting for the Foucauldian adjective, describe it as \"biopolitical,\" thus emphasizing the relationship of such immaterial production to the body. But this body itself seems desexualized. None of them mention the effects on their philosopher's cocks of a dose of Viagra accompanied by the right image. None dare call a spade a spade: the crux of work has become sexual, spermatic, mas - turbatory, toxicological; and if you're expecting any eco-nomic benefit from work, it must produce the effect of a fix; and when all is said and done, we are talking about a type of work that must be called pharmacopornopolitical , rather than biopolitical . Let's stop beating about the bush and say it: in a porn economy, there is no work that isn't destined to cause a hard-on, to keep the global cock erect; no work that doesn't trigger the secretion of endorphins, no work that doesn't reinforce the feeling of omnipotence of your basic hetero-macho consumer. Our current form of capitalism or pro-duction could be defined as an economy of ejaculation. The only authentic surplus value is the index of the cock's eleva-tion, its hardness and rigidity, the volume of its spermatic ejaculations. Contemporary pharmacopornographic work cannot in any case be described as immaterial. Nothing in reality is less Pornpower 293immaterial than the work on which pharmacopornographic capitalism is based; rather than immaterial, we could \u00fcber material , supramaterial, technomaterial, or hyperma- terial, because its texture is biological, molecular, as well as carnal and digital, irreducibly synaptic and capable of being digitized; and its ultimate objective is the production of erections, ejaculations, and spermatic volume. Besides, part of this work can be measured in liters and deciliters of flow, in the number of muscular reactions and chemical discharges. As a way of emphasizing this materiality, dur - ing a performance, Annie Sprinkle calculated in inches the number of cocks she'd sucked while she was a sex worker and compared them with the height of the Empire State Building. 17 There is no immaterial sex work just as there is no porn without the cum shot, whether it's semen, female ejaculate, or condensed milk. There is no work that isn't wet work. The simultaneous spread of urban sprawl and networks of prostitution, the colonization of populations able to be sexualized through war or sex tourism, the pro-duction technique of feminizing or masculinizing a living body, the control of physiological reactions by pharmaco - logical compounds whose manufacture and sale are sur - veyed and controlled by state medico-legal organisms and by the pharmaceutical multinationals, the digital recording and intentional diffusion of fragments of life previously considered private, the production of pornographic mate-rial in the domestic space and its distribution through the 17. Annie Sprinkle, Post-Porn Modernist: My 25 Years as a Multimedia Whore (Berkeley, CA: Cleis Press, 1998).294 P ornpowerInternet\u2014all are so many signs of the appearance of a type of \u00fcbermaterial production. If contemporary work isn't immaterial, it also isn't the product of a process of \"feminization,\" as has been claimed. It isn't possible to assert with Lazzarato that \"the content and conditions of work today, the result of intense restruc - turing, are only the underlying extension of the character - istics of work, whether salaried or not, that has structurally and historically been assigned to women,\" 18\u2014unless and only if we intend the term women as a signifier referring to all the toxicological, affective, racialized, and sexualized male and female workers (men and women, cis- and trans-). It will therefore be more relevant to claim that the content and the conditions of contemporary work are the exten-sion of the toxicosexual and pharmacopornographic work performed by bodies that often appear labeled as feminine (independently of their gender) and that today are being extremely racialized and pauperized. Their common condi-tion comes less from being the bodies of cis-females than from appearing as bodies that are penetrable (by capital), bodies that provoke ejaculation at the best possible price. All the criteria that has been recategorized under the label feminization of work, such as flexibility, total avail- ability, high level of adaptability, vulnerability, talent for improvisation, and so on are only the basic and previously 18. Maurizio Lazzarato, (2001).Pornpower 295unpublished curriculum vitae of any virtuoso sex worker. The characteristics of sex work\u2014lack of security, sale of corporal and affective services at a low price, social devalua-tion of the body that performs the work, exclusion from the right to residency\u2014are becoming central in the post-Ford-ist paradigm of the twenty-first century. Or more precisely, they were always there, but their character is becoming structural and explicit, revealing the slimy engine of pro-duction. Today, no structure of capitalist production func - tions without the aid of a masturbatory device and without a certain quantity of spilled sperm (spreading from the industry of culture and spectacle to telephony and tele-communications, by way of computer programming, the arms industry, the pharmaceutical industry, etc.). All these forms of work are becoming gradually pornified, and their casualization and apparent feminization are indicative of a new process that is making the orgasmic force of each body available to capital. The pOrnOgraphi C diVisiOn OF labOr The concept of the pornification of work takes us back to the orgasmico-affective dimension of production (traditionally performed as a salaried task by a limited number of men and women considered to be \"whores\"). This work is char - acterized by the transformation into capital worth (surplus value) of body contact (whether virtual or present); of the excitation of biochemical centers of hormonal production; of the production and transmission of affects; of the recep-296 P ornpowertion of an audiovisual impulse; of the connection of the neocrotex with blood vessels irrigating the erectile tissue of the penis, clitoris, or skin; of the reaction of the centers that produce endorphins and ocytocin; of a response to a certain substance by a particular biochemical metabolism, under the form of an immediate or deferred pleasure, and so on. Until now, the feminist Marxist analysis of production used the notion of sexual division of labor to refer specifically to the work of reproduction for which cis-females as \"egg carriers\" took responsibility. However, such a notion needs to be qualified, to the point of being radically changed, if we wish to take into account the current conditions of phar - macopornographic production. The concept of the \"sexual division of labor\" is a ref - erence to the reproductive division of the species, which establishes a structural segmentation between bodies with uteruses capable of bringing to completion the develop-ment of a viable fetus and bodies without uteruses (having a uterus rather than producing eggs is today the determin-ing difference, since a fertilized egg can be implanted within another uterus) that have no possibility of gestation. This division, according to which the difference between the work of production and the work of reproduction function as a sexual difference, takes for granted the coincidence between the body of a woman and a body provided with a fertilizable uterus capable of sexual reproduction. However, the relationship between femininity and reproduction is an asymmetrical one, first of all, because not every body that has been assigned female gender is endowed with a fertil-Pornpower 297izable uterus capable of bringing a viable fetus to comple- tion and, second, because, even in the case of bodies that are capable of gestation, the time spent on reproduction is not equivalent to the total life of the subject. Therefore, it's more relevant to speak of the techno-reproductive and tech-nogestational division of labor to refer to the segmentation of bodies in a way that is derived from the technologically con-structed capacity for reproduction and gestation. On the one hand, the body of a trans man (who has kept his uterus and has simply stopped the administration of testosterone) can be inseminated and can bring to term a successful ges - tation. On the other hand, current research appears to be announcing the future possibility of gestation in an artifi-cial uterus, or the implantation of an embryo in a pseudo-uterine gestational cavity inside the body of a cis-man. In the concept of the sexual division of labor, the term sexual silently sanctions the normatively heterosexual\u2014 hetero by default\u2014character of reproduction, assuming that it goes without saying that heterosexual reproduction is the only kind that is natural. What would be needed to begin with is the realization that the institutions of hetero-sexual breeding (the heterosexual couple, marriage, social recognition of \"natural\" kinship), as well as their practices (coitus as biopenis/biovagina penetration, followed by ejac - ulation), are techniques of culturally assisted reproduction that have been sociopolitically sanctioned and naturalized by tradition and law. Although it's more obvious when it comes to current practices of medically assisted reproduc - tion, the nature of the political technology at work in any sexual reproduction accompanies and defines\u2014both his -298 P ornpowertorically and culturally\u2014all processes of filiation. In order to move away as far as possible from contemporary queer relational configurations and get closer to the founding myths of reproduction in the West, let's take an example from the Bible. The major patriarchs, often married to sterile women (were they cis-males presenting themselves socially as females?), used the living bodies of their slaves as reproductive organs, without such a practice modifying the relationship that the fruit of such unions would maintain with their \"sterile\" mothers. Such is the case, not only for the Holy Family but also for Jacob, whose wife Rachel was sterile, and who inseminated his slave Bilhah. Their children would be considered Rachel's. Here it would seem that the slave has the double task of providing sex and reproducing even if the weight of the sex work and care of the child falls to Rachel, in her role as sterile wife, but without it causing her to lose the recognition of her \"natural maternity.\" In this case, \"kinship,\" as Donna J. Haraway demonstrates, is a \"technology for producing the material and semiotic effect of natural kinship, of shared kind.\" 19 The mid-twentieth-century invention of the Pill, which separates heterosexuality and reproduction, differentiates and reveals the multiplicity and specificity of those services involved in reproduction: specifically sexual work, the pro-duction of spermatozoids and ova, the work of gestation (insemination, pregnancy, delivery), and work having to do with care of the newborn. All work of reproduction does not involve sexual work, and all sexual work does not involve 19. Haraway, Modest_Witness , 53. Pornpower 299the work of reproduction. If the Pill really has separated heterosexuality and reproduction, it clearly does not seem to have liberated heterosexual cis-females from these two other tasks. For cis-females, true liberation from heterosex - ual work and from the work of reproduction cannot come from contemporary methods of contraception (capitalist tools of control and pharmacopornographic consumption), but from a radial transformation of their gender status and of their sex and sexuality, and from a reappropriation of the sexopolitical techniques of subjectification. whaT Flares up Fas T, e x T inguishes sOO n Would you like to have a stronger ejaculation?

Meanwhile, however, in the laborato-ries of pharmacopornism, capital has taken other paths and orgasmic force is being employed on other fronts. The mar - keting campaign for this Viagra counterfeit has spilled the beans: pharmacopornographic masculinity isn't defined by its capacity for masturbatory erection but, more precisely, by the difficulty of maintaining the erection. The market of chemical and audiovisual products are supplementing erec - tions to the point of supplanting them. On graphs show - ing economic growth, the curve showing capital follows the rise of an erection. And vice versa. As we have seen, the mechanism at work in the equation sexual difference = coitus = heterosexuality became explicit with the production of the first synthetic hormones in the 1950s, when capi-talism foresaw the advantages of working with a malleable and sexually polymorphic body that could be intentionally transformed into feminine or masculine, would react to any kind of sexual stimulation, could be a consumer as well as a producer and sexual worker, and could, at the same time, be the keeper of an orgasmic force and also the potential buyer of an exterior orgasmic force.Pornpower 301peneTrable Ori FiCes and peneTraT ing e x T re M i T ies The global proletarization of sex, deprived of critical con- sciousness and political action, is increasing the occasions for and forms of oppression and submission. Nonetheless, the pornographic division of labor isn't disappearing; it's diversifying and changing. All workers are becoming part of production in the form of so many swollen chests and penetrable pussies, anuses, and mouths; in the form of so many flaccid, erectile, or turgescent cocks; in the estrogen-, testosterone-, serotonin-, and sperm-producing bodies; in the form of so many techno-organic connectors that can be integrated with the global digital pharmacoporno circuit. Each worker enters the pharma-coporn factory as \"penetrable-penetrating,\" as a secretion facilitator or as a secretor, as a furnisher of something to shoot or as an addicted body, as a productive or dependent toxicological platform. Or both. These segmentations are not dependent on any type of innate, biological, or acquired predisposition; they are for all bodies that possess an anus, a mouth, or any otorhino orifices that are potentially pene-trable. All bodies that possess a tongue, fingers, or arms are potentially penetrating or can become a port for prosthetic insertion (dildonic or cybernetic). All bodies are capable of producing sensorial excitation of some kind (speech, image, smell, touch); they can suck or be sucked. All bod-ies are at the same time toxic drug and addicted subject, fit and crip, 20 organic and supplemented by technology. Here, 20. \"Crip\" is a term used by disability activists to appropriate \"crippled\" or other derogatory words for \"disabled.\"302 P ornpowerthe division of sexual work doesn't depend on a natural condition, but on a technical specialization of the body, a somato-political programming. Nevertheless, we now find ourselves in a distinctive sexopolitical ecology: in our current configuration of gender dimorphism, only the bodies of cis-females, trans-females, and gays are considered to be potentially penetrable bodies , in the same way that only the bodies of cis-males present themselves and are represented as natural and universal penetrators. This biopolitical division of bodies produces successive segmentations of social space according to gen-der. However, these segmentations are gradually destabi-lized by the increasing technologizing of the production of pleasure and sexual reproduction. It follows that the sexual division of labor is currently becoming diluted, is subsid-ing, or is even reversing, since more and more cis-females have the possibility of achieving the position of universal penetrators. Similarly, a growing number of cis-males, find-ing themselves in an insecure financial position, will have to accede to the position of penetrated anuses, fellating mouths, and masturbating hands, eventually becoming pornographic signs or exciting prostheses, transforming into universal audiovisual masturbatory mechanisms. If we think of this technical division of sexual work in the current context of globalization and migratory flux, the following conclusion seems imperative: a majority of migrant bodies declared illegal and distinguished by lines of racialization and social exclusion have been put in the position of \"global anuses\" (and here the notion of \"anus\" indicates the posi-tion of pharmacoporno workers who are universally pen-Pornpower 303etrable), whereas the Western white minorities (cis-males or cis-females) are attaining or preserving their position as universal penetrators. What concerns capital is the ability of any body endowed with political subjectivity to experience pleasure and to produce it in other bodies endowed with masturbatory political subjectivity. But such a form of capitalism is not hedonism. For as Weber-Hilton's principles state, the goal is not the production of pleasure but the control of political subjectivity by means of the management of the excitation-frustration circuit. The purpose of porn, as is that for sexual work, is the production of frustrating satisfaction . In this context of production and masturbatory con- trol, talking about sexual liberation or the war between the sexes seems obsolete. What must be substituted for them are notions of pharmacopornographic domination, resis - tance, and hacking; what is at work here is a confrontation between pan-ejaculating subjectivities as well as a throng of subjectivities that perform the function of masturba-tory prostheses (penetrated anuses and vaginas, fellating mouths, hands that jerk off, bodies that are dependent on chemical doses) struggling to achieve self-determination as technoliving bodies capable of joy and pleasure. This new pharmacopornographic proletariat is not sim- ply an economic subject engaged in producing sexual and toxicological surplus value; it is also a new form of political subject. Even if it cannot embody the promises of radical feminism (which was betrayed by white liberal feminism 304 P ornpowerand state-backed censors and abolitionists), the promises of the queer and crip movements (betrayed by the gay and transsexual movements, as well as by the disability asso-ciations and by their alliances with the powers of medi-cine, law, media, and the troubled-persons industries), the promises of movements for nonallopathic medicine and the antispeciesism movement and the movement for the depenalization of drugs (betrayed by pharmacological agreements and threatened by state mafias and those of the drug traffickers), it finds its source directly in the ejecta of these exhausted movements. It is growing from their revolutionary dunghills. general sex Here is a possible pharmacopornographic definition of sex - uality: a techno-organic activity corresponding to the type of work praxis in which\u2014to follow Marx's formulation\u2014\"production is inseparable from the act of producing\" and is thus \"an activity that has no end product,\" because it is \"a practice that finds its own achievement in itself, with-out becoming objectified in any outcome that exceeds it.\" 21 Paolo Virno reminds us that Marx resorted to this category to conceive of those workers \"whose labor turns into a vir - tuosic performance: pianists, butlers, dancers, teachers, 21. Paolo Virno, A Grammar of the Multitude: For an Analysis of Contemporary Forms of Life, trans. Isabella Bertoletti, James Cascaito, and Andrea Casson (New York: Semiotext(e), 2004), 54.

No practice corresponds so well with Marx's description of nonproductive and virtuosic production as the one that serves as the foundation of the urban sexual market today: fellatio. Marx and Engels consider prostitution to be the structural complement of the bourgeois institution of monogamous marriage. Nevertheless, they are leaving out an essential form of nonproductive labor, performed by female and male sex workers whose virtuosic activity con-sists in exciting and producing pleasure. 23 Sex work must be thought of as pharmacopornographic poiesis and belongs to the type of activities that Marx calls \"servile work\" or non-productive \"labor in which no capital is invested, but a wage is paid (example: the personal services of a butler),\" 24 work that is always living and corporal. As Virno observes, what characterizes virtuosic and nonproductive forms of work is their constituent dependency regarding a context that Marx calls \"cooperation\": there is no virtuoso and nonpro-ductive work without \"publicly organized space,\" 25 without 22.

The customer doesn't consume anything (there is no object or outcome), noth-ing but a fantasy that is physically or virtually embodied by the worker through what Annie Sprinkle calls \"perfor - mance,\" a dramatization of sexuality whose goal is to trig-ger the excitation-frustration cycle. As conceived by Roland Barthes in Sade, Loyola et Fourier, pornographers are \"sce-nographers,\" manufacturers of a public context, a theatri-cal d\u00e9cor in which the ritual of excitation-frustration takes place; 27 a technical device for the publication of sexuality that connects bodies to audiovisual and telecommunica-tion technologies. In a situation of this type, we ought to be speaking no longer about \"intellectual cooperation\" but about masturbatory cooperation . Whereas the theorists of post-Fordism employ the Marx - ist notion of General Intellect to speak about the commu- nicative potential for cooperation among brains as a new platform of capitalist production, we theorists of the post - porn era are emphasizing the notion of General Sex , or 26. A notion of Marx that, in a post-Fordist rereading, confirms immaterial work and the Barthes, Sade , 10.Pornpower 307\"public sex,\" to conceive of the cooperation between bodies, desires, impulses, organic fluxes, molecules, and pleasures mobilized by pharmacopornographic capitalism. Pharma-copornographic labor cultivates, exploits, and produces the sexual technobody of the multitude. The new capital is put together by the array of corporal and sexual relationships and relationships of dependency, by modes of the produc - tion of circuits of excitation-frustration, which deposit layer after layer of the force of sexual work, affecting the entire length of the process of production. All pharmaco-pornographic relationships (whether sexual, or whether a matter of a body's relations with itself, or whether a mat - ter of those dependencies that link a molecule to a living metabolism) can be transformed into (at least partially, but without being reduced to) fixed capital. And living sexual labor captured and converted into property by an enterprise can become productive and therefore competi-tive on an international level. In such a case, productivity cannot be measured on the basis of quantity of production per hour worked; it cannot refer to a single enterprise or specific sector, but must refer to the entire group of exci-tation-frustration factors that make up the technoliving body and that go beyond the individual worker. Seven min-utes of high on cocaine or a twenty-five-second orgasm is well worth the existence of an efficient cybernetic system of distribution and exchange of documents, archives, and hypertexts and is enough to justify the covert chain of pro-duction and virtual distribution of molecules and bodies, images and sounds.308 P ornpowerGeneral Sex \u2014public erection, global ejaculation, collective coming, orbital shooting\u2014is the impulse for communal joy that travels through the multitude, convulsing the totality of excitable producer-bodies of capital. General Sex is exciting communication, global masturba- tory strength, the connecting of potentially joyful subjec - tivities. But beware, General Sex cannot be reduced, must not be reduced, to liters of spilled sperm, or to fixed capital: its practice occurs in the communication of excitation, in the forms of performative paradigms (of the theatraliza-tion of gender roles and sexual games) and psychotropic doses, by means of incessant molecular variations and hormonal modulations. General Sex teaches us that mas - turbation and the fix are never solitary activities but are vibrations coming from cooperating bodies, effects of the collective practice of sexual or pharmacological labor on the living orgasmic body that squirts capital everywhere. In this context of exploding sexual productive forces, coopera-tion between bodies absorbs all other types of productive labor, in a way that makes all commodities simultaneously an incitation to sexual pleasure and the frustration of that same pleasure. One of the keys of the productive circuit of excitation-frustration-excitation lies in the toxicological nature of sexual pleasure. When we speak of a pharmaco-pornographic economy, we must take into account the fact that the two tentacles (pharmaco and porno) are exploiting a common somato-political foundation: the toxicological dimension of pleasure. The pleasure (in its capacity as frus - trating satisfaction) of the multitude is the ultimate source of the production of wealth.Pornpower 309The sex wOrker beCOM ing Cyb Org In Marx's analysis of the different forms of exploitation in the industrial economy, the productive dimension of sexual and domestic services provided by the dominant classes of women, by the working classes, and by colonized bod-ies occurs nearly unperceived (in terms of its specificity of gender, class, and race). In an 1892 essay, Simmel develops a pioneering theory of sexual services: he contemplates the practice of prostitution as one of the components of the urban economy. For Simmel, the economic specificity of the prostituted body is to function as an \"ejaculation mecha-nism.\" 28 This analysis allows him to compare the prostitute to other technical workers who perform \"unrewarding\" tasks, such as those who work \"in the arsenic mine, or in the mirror-coating factory and in all the directly danger - ous or slowly poisoning manufacturing plants.\" 29 Sex work, like work in mines, cannot be reduced to the simple act of taking a load or loading coal, or to the effort expended by the mouth or hand to accomplish such tasks, \"but con-tains implicitly his entire previous training, his entire past. Similarly, the work of countless workers and that of pros - titutes contains all its consequences and its relationships, the entire attitude toward life and the entire future of the worker.\" 30 To Marx's definition of sexual work (with or despite Marx) as \"nonproductive production\" or \"private service,\" 28.

In the second half of the twentieth century, pharmacologi- cal intoxication, the production of sexuality and commu-nication become mass-produced work. But unlike work in the information-communication and cultural industries, mass-produced sex and toxicological work are located in the framework of underground labor that is off the books, unsalaried, without union representation, and marginal or illegal. As a shadow of communications work (that is more invisible than it is immaterial), pharmacopornographic work supports and animates all other contemporary pro-ductive economy. In a certain way, the pornographic and pharmaceutical industries conform to the Fordist criteria of Taylorization and seriality: pornographic audiovisual grammar has the goal of triggering an ejaculation with the minimal num-ber of shots and scenes, the same way that the molecule sildenafil (Viagra's active ingredient) must initiate a lasting erection, accompanied by an always renewable sufficient dose of pleasure. Nevertheless, actuating a sexual assem-bly line that would permit the permanent industrialization of sex work seems difficult to achieve. Certainly pornogra-phy is upping its degree of technological serial processing thanks to programming and circulation by digital means. However, for the moment and at the start of the third mil-lennium, there is no machine capable of performing fellatio Pornpower 311assembly-line style that can supplant the biomouth or any robotic masturbator capable of distracting the attention of customers who can get a hand job from a humanoid for ten euros in the Parisian bois de Boulogne. Until recently, the technological restrictions and hur - dles for the processes of industrialization that were charac - teristic of domestic work were equally at play in sex work. In both cases, it was a matter of keeping the domestic and sexual workforce in the most carnal and vulnerable of states, of reducing these spaces of production to the \"pri-vate\" sphere, of removing domestic and sexual work from the world of paid activities and thus preventing their con-tact with principles of democracy and visibility. If it is true that domestic space has been the object of a certain technologizing since World War II, we must still agree with Angela Davis's contention that this process has not led to any radical emancipation of the (unsala-ried) domestic worker. 31 Davis asks us to imagine work - ers at high-performance, high-tech companies performing domestic work in a context of serial organization: cooked meals delivered to the home; laundry picked up, washed, and ironed; industrial cleaning of every domestic space, and so on, services that would make the tasks of the house-wife obsolete. Nevertheless, these activities are still being performed today to a large extent by unpaid female bod-ies or by bodies in a precarious work situation (often, a legal, racialized immigrant or one without papers), those for whom access to other kinds of employment is checked 31. Davis, \"The Approaching Obsolesce of Housework: A Working Class Perspective,\" chap. 13 in Women, Race & Class.312 P ornpowerby immigration laws and by the racial segregation of legal work, and for whom access to the political space has been permanently blocked. In reality, male and female domes - tic workers occupy positions resembling those of male and female sex workers. According to Marx's taxonomy, the whore, the house- wife, and the domestic worker belong to the same category of service and nonproductive work, and such a classifica-tion owes nothing to chance. The whore is ceaselessly engaged in the work of excitation and production of plea-sure, while the housewife is engaged in the never completed task of taking care of hygiene and bodies and producing relaxation (including the sexual type) for the inhabitants of the home. The domestic slave is merely a hybridization of these two forms of exploitation of the potentia gaudendi . In all cases, the work lacks a finished product, does not stand as an autonomous and defined accomplishment, and is a productive practice that corresponds to Marx's formula for \"private services.\" 32 Culturally, these corporal practices are considered not possible to mechanize, not able to be entirely absorbed by technical production. During modernity, the double-helix trajectory that led to the domestication of sexuality and the sexualization of domestic work brought with it an even stricter privatiza-tion of the two practices. Therefore, a possible philosophi-cal pornology would encourage us to think of domestic activity (paid or unpaid) as part of the economy of sexual work in the broad sense of the term that brings together 32. Virno, A Grammar of Multitudes, 53.Pornpower 313the processes of breeding, culture, and care of masturba- tory/ejaculating subjectivity. In a counterintuitive way, the technologizing of sexual work is not revealed by the presence of technical tools for sexuality. It operates more subtly, by means of the biotech-nological production of the cultural body of the sex worker, a process we could dub \"sex-worker-becoming-cyborg,\" according to Klynes and Clyne's concept, as repoliticized by Donna J. Haraway. 33 Or, to put it another way: the ideal sex worker, the high-tech cock-sucking machine, is a mouth treated with silicone that is silent and politically subaltern and belongs to an immigrant cis-female or transsexual without access to administrative identity and full citizen-ship. The sex machines of the third millennium are living bodies denied entrance into the political sphere, deprived of public discourse, stripped of union rights and strikes, and lacking medical care or unemployment benefits. Unlike for traditional Fordism, there is no longer any competition between machine and worker. On the contrary: the worker is becoming a sexual biomachine. True technologizing of sex work is accomplished through the production of sexual bodies as ejaculatory mechanisms and ejaculating sexual bodies. Most of the male and female sex workers of the twenty-first century are biopolitical, 33. See Donna J. Haraway, \"A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist- Feminism 20th Century,\" in Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: the Reinvention of 1990), 149-81. Originally published as \"Manifesto for cyborgs: science, technology, and socialist feminism in the 1980s,\" Socialist Review, no. 80 (1985): 65-108.314 P ornpowerlumpen-proletarianized, racialized cyborgs, adapted to the process of the mass production of pleasure at reduced price. But careful, for we must not see in this case any natu-ral determination, not about sex, or gender, or race. This is solely a matter of differences resulting from the processes of sexopolitical specialization. Any cis-male or cis-female at all has the capability to follow a process of pharmacoporno-graphic transformation into a technically performing whore. Let's take the body of a cis-male as an example: such a trans - formation would necessitate regular doses of estrogen and Androcur, a certain amount of silicone to produce breasts and buttocks, and permanent body hair removal, and will probably also entail preserving a working biopenis (such a biotool is a precious instrument of work for professional activities and is equally valued by both homosexual and heterosexual clientele). When it comes to being a source of potentia gaudendi , any body can become a fairly expert mul- timedia technowhore in a relatively short space of time. In pharmacopornism, the zones of pornographic pro- duction and sex work occupy a structural position that is similar to that of a prison. The cartography composed by the circuits of the sex industry, the penal-industrial com-plex, and domestic spaces is made up of enclaves of maxi-mum exploitation, genuine oases of \u00fcbermaterial capitalism, dystopic reserves of biopolitical experimentation existing at the heart of contemporary democratic societies. 34 Porn 34. See Angela Y. Davis, Are Prisons Obsolete? (New York: Seven Stories Press, 2003); David Ladipo, \"The Rise of America's Prison aux Etats-Unis,\" in L'Esclavage, 247-74. Pornpower 315and prison are the only two industries that function in our democratic and humanist societies in accordance with a pro-slavery regime that is close to the economy of the plan-tation: racial and gender segregation; minimal or nonexis - tent salaries; 35 prohibition of unions and the right to strike; an absence of paid holidays, sick days, or unemployment insurance. The sex industry 36 and the prison-industrial complex are the two domains in which workers are entirely deprived of civil rights, and any economic or moral entitle-ment over the products of their work are expropriated from them. The current European penal code (its condemnation of the marketing and consumption of drugs, sex work, and the distribution of certain pornographic audiovisual mate-rial) is one of the techniques of delegitimization and desub-jectivization of the bodies of pharmacoporno workers. Once they are reduced to the category of criminal, their potentia gaudendi can be used freely or at a low price. Through such a biopolitical coup, the same historical and material subjects occupy the interior of a closed circuit that links the drug industry to the sex industry and to the penal-industrial complex. More than a ghetto, it should be thought of as a spatiotemporal wormhole inside contemporary democratic societies. If Angela Davis's argument is transposed to the sex industry, the penal-industrial complex and the domains of 35. For example, a worker in San Quentin Prison in San Francisco earns twenty cents an hour, or $1.60 a day, a salary comparable to that given a worker in an industry that has relocated to Cambodia. 36. With some rare exceptions, in which the actors and directors of porn do sign contracts for traditional productions; for example, in the case of John B. Root and Marc Dorcel, or for Canal-Plus.316 P ornpowerwork in pornography and prostitution seem a fresh expedi- ent for the continuation of the economy of slavery at the heart of Western democratic societies. That is, the porno-narco-prison wormhole is no exception as a space, but is a subterranean coil in which the new technologies of control and production of the technoliving are tested before their being extended to democratic society as a whole. Therefore, in the context of the pharmacopornist economy, the war (which is an extreme form of the porno-narco-prison complex) isn't exterior to the economy of pro-duction and consumption in times of \"peace,\" but a special laboratory for experimentation on the global scale for hard drugs, mass rapes, unpaid and obligatory sexual services, and programs of technobiopolitical extermination. The pharmacopornographic regime is rising from the ruins of World War II. It towers upward like the nuclear mushroom of the H-bomb. The psychopolitical heritage (extreme violence, maximum excitation, collective drug addiction, posttraumatic symptoms, etc.) and technology (a network of communication through computer science, the digitization of data, the invention of molecules and synthetic materials, etc.) of the experimental industry of the war is permitting the implementation on a global scale of new technologies for the production of pleasure (excita-tion-frustration) in the technoliving body.Pornpower 317318Virgin OlOgy The new year. I get stoned. In every way possible. Always more so. The first time she fucked me with my own dildo-harness, she made me come as if I were a schoolgirl. Being taken by your own dildo-harness: an act of extreme humil-ity, relinquishing all forms of my hormonal, prosthetic, or cultural virility. She induces me to produce a form of femi-ninity I've never allowed myself. Not an essential feminin-ity, or a nature hidden behind the drag king, but rather, a kind of \"masculine femininity,\" 1 a \"drag king femininity.\" I'm her king bitch, her trans whore, a kid showing his vulva behind her big cock. I've become her slave, getting pierced angrily, a nymphomaniac who'd like to unzip every fly in search of sex organs to take into my mouth, for every orifice. Without her, I would have stuck to my insatiable instinct to penetrate. Only she, queen of the bitches, had the right to transform this body into a hole that's always open, at her disposal. Gloriam penetrationis . It is at that moment that I define the principles of such pharmacopornographic knowledge:11. J ImI and me 1. See Judith Halberstam, Female Masculinity (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1998).Concerning the queer perfection and that VD does every - thing in the most desirable way.2 The conception of VD that is the most common and the most full of meaning is expressed well enough in the words VD is an absolutely perfect being. The implications, however, of these words fail to receive sufficient consideration. For instance, there are many different kinds of perfection in pornography and in feminism, all of which VD possesses, and each one of them pertains to her in the highest degree. We must also know what perfection is. One thing that can surely be affirmed about it is that those forms or natures that are not susceptible to transgenerization to the highest degree are not perfections. Consequently, pornog-raphy and feminism are perfections, and insofar as they pertain to VD, they have no limits. From where it follows that VD, who possesses supreme and infinite wisdom, acts in the most perfect manner, not only metaphysically, but also from the moral standpoint. And with respect to ourselves, it can be said that the more we are enlightened and informed in regard to the works of VD, the more will we be disposed to find them excellent and conforming entirely to that which we might desire. That love for VD demands on our part complete satisfac - tion and acquiescence without it being necessary inasmuch to be a cis-male. To act conformably to the love of VD it is not sufficient to have an orgasm; we must be really satisfied with all that comes to us according to her will. Since she is the best of 2. See G.W. Leibniz, Discourse on Metaphysics and the Monadology (1686), ed. Albert R. Chandler, trans. George R. Montgomery (New York: Dover, 2008). Jimi and me 319all mistresses, she ever demands only the right intentions, and it is for her to know the hour and the proper place to let good designs succeed. Of all beings, that which is the most perfect and occu- pies the least possible space, that is to say, that which inter - feres with another the least, is her love. The activity or the acts of will of VD are commonly divided into ordinary and extraordinary. VD desires everything that is an object of her particular intention. When we consider the objects of her general intentions, however, such as are the modes of activities of created things and especially of the unreason-ing creatures and creatures in love with whom VD wishes to cooperate, we must make a distinction, for if the action is good in itself we must say that VD wishes it and at times commands it, even though it does not take place; but if it is bad in itself and becomes good only by accident through the course of events and especially after chastisement and satisfaction have corrected its malignity and rewarded the ill with interest in such a way that more perfection results in the whole train of circumstances than would have come if that ill had not occurred\u2014if all this takes place we must say that VD permits the evil, and not that she desired it, although she has cooperated by means of the laws of sex that she has established. She knows how to produce the greatest good from them. While I'm reading these precepts, she's caressing the space between my eyes, then between my ear and the roots of my hair; she kisses the hollows of my knees; puts my feet between her thighs to warm them. She is writing her book, 320 J imi and meKing Kong Theory, in front of me. Her back very straight. Tangled, blond rocker hair, a ring on each finger. On the right hand, a skull and crossbones, and on the left, a fake diamond. Every once in a while, she rolls a fake joint and smokes it as she writes, without looking at the keyboard, and with the speed of an electronic printer. I read the chapters as she finishes them, and I get them as if they were babies still drowsy, opening their eyes for the first time before me. A turn-on. I recognize the voice that excites me, fucks me: the voice of a teenage punk who has learned to speak using a cis-male program for the production of gender, the aris - tocratic brain of a futurist she-wolf lodged in the body of a hooker, the intelligence of a Nobel Prize winner incarnated in a street dog. A biopolitical miracle: the proof that new geneticopolitical and literary recombinations are possible. She gets up and dances in front of the curtainless window, to the glory of the neighborhood. All the new generations of dykes can be found in the body that harbors that voice, in its neuronal territory. Come, little girls, those who wear the veil and those who do not, those who have children and those who have none, those who suck cocks and those who don't, those who want to have a mustache and those who don't. Take and eat. Meanwhile, I'm reading Laplanche's text on the \"general theory of seduction,\" in order to under - stand de Lauretis's fascination with the implantation of subjectivity. 3 The earliest seduction is a thorn planted in the somatic field of the mind, around which the subject develops like a callosity. 3. See Jean Laplanche, Problematiques, vol. 7, Le Fourvoiement biologisant de 2006). Jimi and me 321pOliTiCs OF Care As I submit my mind to the discipline of virile coaching and take testosterone, VD is gradually initiating me into the cultural rituals of femininity. As a result, after six months with her, I alternately occupy two extremes of the gender-cultural apparatus. On the one hand, there are my exercises in intentional masculinization, somato-political gymnas - tics brought to bear against received education, against the programs of gender that dominate social and political representation, sometimes even against my own desire; on the other is my feminine primping: hair styling, manicures, peels, massages, pedicures, removal of unwanted hair. In reality, testosterone belongs to neither of these two devices for the production of gender. Mixed with the other mole-cules in my body, it instead composes the somato-political context for the performative implantation of these prac - tices. Both these devices belong to what we could call an aesthetic (in the dermatocosmetic sense of the term, the skin being the largest and most public organ of the body and therefore the main platform for somato-political and performative implantation and agency), or even ethic, of genders: the attention, the intentional care brought to the somato-political production of masculinity and femininity. Having made up her mind to help me discover the ins and outs of feminization, VD invites me to go with her for some thalassotherapy. In a luxurious hotel complex in Bretagne, we spend a week in bathrobes and plastic san-dals, soaking in baths of algae, floating in iodized and bio-energized Jacuzzis, eating oysters while reading Le Figaro 322 J imi and me(the French right-wing newspaper being the only paper available), and fucking. An unforgettable week. For the first time in my life, I agree to have a manicure. A translucent-glass staircase leads to the place where the treatments are given, a room in the shape of a shell, with walls and floor in pearly white. Several branches of red coral holding pendants, necklaces, Dior, Chanel, and Dolce & Gabbana watches are on display in a window; another has been con-verted into an aquarium in which a colony of little puppet fish are living with bracelets and pearls. The curious world of high-class white femininity. They call this strange uni-verse a \"center for marine beauty treatments.\" A young woman welcomes me, hands me a white bathrobe, a March issue of Vogue . There's a ten-minute wait, she tells me. I've brought my own book. I look around the place with con-tempt. The d\u00e9cor and the cis-females who are waiting for a skin cleansing seem terribly short on style, intelligence. A wave of anguish rises in me. My left-wing radical trans-lesbian culture puts me on guard against this form of gen-der hedonism. At the height of this political despondency, another young woman comes to get me. I think about warning her immediately that, contrary to what she may think, I'm not a simple cis-female, about telling her that I'm trans, that this is the first time that I've been here, that I don't even know what I'm doing there. I consider asking her if the procedure for a lady's manicure and a man's are the same, if they use the same products on both. She gives me a friendly smile and takes me into a private room, and I'm incapable of uttering the slightest sound. She has me sit down at a little table covered with a white towel on which Jimi and me 323is a line of about a dozen cosmetics in flasks, several piles of gauze compresses, boxes of colored cotton, a transparent jar containing pink and blue files of various thicknesses. Everything is organized with Leibnizian geometric strict - ness. I sit on a small stool, and she settles in, facing me. Asks me to give her my hands. First she touches my fingers. Then she slides her palms under mine almost all the way to the wrists. She takes my hands and raises them to the level of her eyes. I feel exposed, naked. She places my right hand in a small container filled with lukewarm, pink cream, the color of white skin; then she files the nails on my left hand, one by one. She takes my right hand out of the container of cream, holds it between hers. She strokes it, massages each finger, moves up to the wrist, then rubs the forearm with the rest of the cream. The experience is completely lesbian. An idea goes through my mind: she is aware of handling one of my sexual organs; all the cis-females sitting in the waiting room and reading Vogue know very well why they're here and what they've come to do. Now I see them in a dif - ferent way. They're the masked agents of a secret brigade devoted to female pleasure. The young woman lets go of my right hand, which no longer shows the slightest resistance to being touched; it rests languidly on the table where she has placed it. She begins to massage my left hand, enlaces my fingers with hers, then pinches the tips, before moving back down to the arch of skin at the base of the first pha-lanx. She's giving me a countersexual hand job at the arm. \"How's that?\" she asks. \"Nice, very nice.\" I don't look at her while she's touching me. I can understand what a cis-guy must feel when he goes to a massage parlor and pays for 324 J imi and mea girl to jerk him off. The difference is nominal: they call it \"sex,\" and the women call it \"beauty treatment.\" I come to a rapid conclusion about the functioning of the pharma-copornographic order. In heterosexual culture, well-to-do women can treat themselves to sensual services lavished on them by other women, whereas working-class women, immigrants, or ordinary contract workers are paid to take care of the bodies and erotic well-being of other women, as well as, to be sure, the erotic and sexual well-being of men. Deprived of that parallel homoerotic economy and the sensuality of children, heterosexuality in its capacity as an erotic and political regime would collapse. The only sexual services lavished by men on heterosexual women obviously wouldn't be enough to produce the endorphins and serotonin needed for survival of the body. One thing is clear: the work of taking care of bodies in our society has fallen to women. They take care of men's bodies as well as those of other heterosexual women. That is what is hidden behind the Marxist notion of the \"sexual division of labor.\" It's not just about women being assigned to the sphere of reproduction and men to that of production. It seems a lot more complex than that. The women carry out a funda-mental task without which the eroticopolitical equilibrium of heterosexuality would crumble: bodies to which female gender has been assigned take responsibility for a gener - alized political dermatology. They take care of the skin of the world. One keystone of the heterosexual system is a scrupulous exclusion of the production of sexual pleasure from the framework of cares lavished on women by women. On the other hand, when women take care of men, all care Jimi and me 325becomes potentially able to be sexualized. It is even pos - sible that the number of women who get manicures are comparable to the number of men who go to massage par - lors to have their genitals touched. Absorbed in this eddy of thought, I realize with horror that the young woman is painting my nails red. The prOsTheTiC luCky sTar I don't write a line without getting hard for her, without thinking that in one moment or other, my sex, my dick, my dildo, my hand, my arm will be able to have something to do with her mouth. With 250 milligrams in my skin, it's dif - ficult to expect an adequate sexual response from an estro-gen-filled body. A conclusion becomes obvious: everything would be easier if the heterosexual political imperative were put aside and the exchange of pleasure and sexual discharge were regulated only by molecular excitation. Teaching a hypertestosteroned body to desire hyperestrogened bod-ies: this is one possible definition of cultural heterosexual sadomasochism. She tells me, \"I had a lot of group sex when I came to Paris.\" I imagine dildos of every size have already burst through each of her goddess holes. She tells me, \"No, never,\" while half opening her rubber-duck lips. I had for - gotten that cis-guys don't wear dildos when they're having heterosexual group sex. I know nothing about straight sex. I belong to another species: the boy-girls. Since that's the way it is, blond giant, welcome to the planet trans dyke. 326 J imi and meWomen abandoned by virile poets come to trans world. The possibility of fucking her for the first time with a megadildo triggers a wave of T in me, and heat spreads through my skin, from the coccyx to the neck, flows through my arms and seeps to the point of my tongue. I know the value of my dildos, and I glide molecule by molecule into artificial islands while I evaluate which will have the privilege of fucking her first. I take hold of these centimeters of pure pleasure with my five fingers, the same ones that will later explore the center of her loins, go back up and into her mouth, caress the internal walls of her throat and descend into the digestive tube to the colon. She wants the anatomi-cally realistic blue one. She moans and opens up while lift - ing her legs. At high speed, I steer the bright-blue Aston Martin DB5 to the inside of her tunnels. VD doesn't want me to fuck her with the dildos I've been using up to now to fuck Victor. Victor doesn't want me to fuck VD with the dildos I was using with him. I understand such heightened sense of prosthetic exclusivity. Both of them demand a scrupulous form of plastic fidelity. It pleases me. I go to the sex superstore on the boulevard Magenta; it's hetero, but less expensive than the sex shops in the Marais. On the window, on the bodies of three worn manne-quins, is heaped an eclectic collection of chains, handcuffs, black boas, metal brassieres, nurse's rubber costumes, red hooded capes, and Cat Woman masks. Like any other store in the neighborhood, this one is composed of poor-quality shelves holding porn videos arranged by category, dildos, inflatable dolls, and boxes of pasta shaped like cocks. I pick up a small basket as I enter, then zigzag among the custom-Jimi and me 327ers bent over shelves. Hello, sir, one of the two salesladies who has been chatting behind the counter greets me. A fake blond with white skin and a childish face, a hetero look. The other one has black eyes edged with long, thick, curled eye-lashes. They make me think that she's Franco-Arab, and she seems older, but is certainly not more than about twenty. I take a student tour of the different sizes, materials, colors, prices. The sex accessories superstore is a commercial apo-theosis of the straight sexopolitical imagination. A woman is a body, her entire body is material that can be sexualized; a man is a cock, his sexualized material is reduced to his penis. A few days ago, I asked V to make a list of cis-guys whose cocks she would have liked to suck if her becoming lesbian hadn't been mistimed. Jimi Hendrix was the first name on her list. Cock Number One. The prophet of rock before whom whites kneel. I think of playing a joke on her. I'm still walking around the superstore, and I find a black dildo eas-ily: 8\u00bd inches and very kitsch, with visible veins, the same color as chocolate with a milk chocolate head. Hey, Jimi, can I borrow your cock to plow my blond's ass? Without wanting to be too arrogant, I bet that mine is bigger and better at getting hard. She calls me \"ch\u00e9rie, ch\u00e9ri\" when I drive Jimi in. It doesn't make a difference, but I know that she said it twice\u2014one for each of my sexes. That's how she writes it in the text messages she sends me: ch\u00e9rie, ch\u00e9ri. She is cer-tainly going through a reprogramming of her sexual con-figuration. I show her my prosthetic being: a body with its two little breasts, an 8\u00bd-inch silicone cock emerging from 328 J imi and memy loins, two multifunction arms. I'm installing a \"become- my-dyke-whore\" file in her sexual hardware. We're recon-figured. My body levitates ten inches above hers. The right distance to mine an image of her in the framework delim-ited by my outstretched arms. Outside this framework, the world fades to nothing. In close-up, her brassiere, green and red. A silk flower lies between her breasts. My black-leather harness compacts the Jimi against my clit, my nerve end-ings innervating my dildo all the way to the end. She wants more. Slow, deep fucking. You got me floatin' round and round. You got me floatin' never down. Vamos hasta el final. VD's sex speaks the language of revolution. FuCk beauVOir We've been fucking for more than two months. Almost as much time as I've been taking testosterone. Recently, she's been playing with my feelings. She lets herself be fucked like a whore, but afterward, she weeps, because she misses this, or that, because she can't forget n, n + 1 . . . Four days go by without my giving myself a dose of Testogel. When she rejects me, I feel a rise in estrogen and realize that I could cry at any moment. But I hold back, to keep from seeming like an idiot in love. Under my skin, the monster of the female cultural program is awakening: my body has been trained to produce the affects of a woman, suffer like a woman, love like a woman. Testosterone isn't enough to modify this sensory filter. Fuck Beauvoir. Fuck feminism. Fuck love.Jimi and me 329To avoid sinking into an ordinary episode of female mas - ochism, amplified by a rise in estrogen, I force myself into the strict discipline of a program of virile coaching that I've devised for urgent situations: avoiding all romantic think - ing, I practice several exercises for becoming an elite macho and enduring her absences. When she comes back to me, I'm ready for her. It begins like that. Her body is lying on its side on the bed, her hair hiding her face. The light is a diaphanous white, like her skin. She doesn't remain in that position for very long. She makes a 180\u00b0 turn on her axis, purrs, in a halting voice says, Ch\u00e9ri, come, come to me, give it to me. I don't see her mouth right away. The image of her lips emerges gradually, with her words. First, everything is color. We are made of red alveoli. A second later, her mouth becomes sound, and I perceive it by hearing; \"Foxy Lady\" pours out of the iPod speakers. The music and her voice construct two parallel plateaus. The melody circulates at the upper level, skimming past our heads. Her voices glides, spreads, into the lower stratum, where our bodies are resting, and a circular, gyrating shelf serves as our floor. We haven't entered the sexual stage yet. I'm certain it will arrive right after these sounds. After this note, to be more precise. I prepare myself for it. By stages we climb up to the platform of music, from which the sex emanates. When the rotation of the plate makes my arm coincide with the bedside table, I reach out to open the drawer. It contains four dildos, a hairdrier, a small bottle of lubricant, size XXL condoms, a tube of Biafine, and some hand cream. The outer surface of my eyes caresses these objects in its peripheral vision, 330 J imi and merapidly, takes all of it in, in a flash. Next, my eyes stop to extract a single thing from the whole. I take the Jimi, which is already in its harness; I'm kneeling, caught between the wave of her voice and that of the music. She's telling me, Je suis ta pute, I belong to you. Everything is spinning. I take off my shirt, lower my jeans without taking them all the way off. I thread one of the leather straps between my legs, then hitch Jimi to my pelvis, locking the buckles on each side of my hips. A piece of skin gets stuck in one of the buckles, and I pull harder; the metal leaves a trace of red, a perfect half-circle at the top of my right thigh. I'm hooked up to Jimi. Superstable sex. I exist in the organic-inorganic continuity offered by this sex. I pull my pants back up, put - ting Jimi to the side, against my left leg. Her hand reaches for my jeans, confirms the pressure of the straps on my thighs, intensifies the suction effect of Jimi on my clitoris, detects Jimi's shape, its contours. Now we're having sex: the platforms join, making up a single spongy volume. She takes Jimi out of my fly, jerks me off with her hand, then, with her mouth, takes it halfway in, sucks the tip; she goes no further, because what she wants is for me to fuck her deeply with Jimi, and come on her. So yes, yes, take me like a bitch. I'm not afraid of anything. I'm on my knees between her legs. That's where you belong, ch\u00e9rie, only you. Yes, this is my space. She's a mutant virgin crossing the syn-thetic line of evolution to meet the chief of the clan of the boy-girls. Fucking with her is going back to each knot of my life\u2014the straight girls who kissed me and then left me to go out with cis-guys, the dykes who were disgusted by my dildos; hetero lesbian knots, transphobic knots, Jimi and me 331androcentrist knots\u2014biting into them until they become undone. I'm her trannie, her monster. I'm not afraid of not being a cis-male. I fill my right palm with lube. I wait, before touching her. The music takes charge of us, everything is moving. I start jerking off my dildo. She watches me, sticks out her tongue. Her head turns three times from one side to the other. In that movement, our vision coincides briefly. My Jimi is bursting her open, butting against the bones of her pelvis before moving backward again. She squeals a bit, her face is near mine. I plunge into her farther, more gen-tly, gliding inside at her rhythm. I feel the effort my arms are making, the traction of my dildo, which lifts her hips, bends her body slightly upward. When her pelvis bears my weight, I no longer need to support myself with my hands. I cling to her clavicles, digging my fingers into the hollow space between her neck and her bones. The eye's surface allows the image to touch it: sex is videographic. Now we are coming in green. Then the impression becomes more olfactory than visual, more haptic than auditory. It's uni-verse mating. A connection made of human phenotypes, language, electronic sounds, and dildos, which I accept dur - ing the duration of the penetration as part of my conscious - ness. I breathe deeply, feeling the electricity rising from my feet to my chest and spreading through my fingers. This is the power of love. The power of digging a hole in her body through which the music flows. The power of knowing that she'd do anything at all to have me between her thighs. The power I extract from her sex.332 J imi and me333The old hegemonic grammarians \u2014inc luding the sexolo- gists\u2014had lost control of gender and its proliferating siblings. \u2014Donna J. ha raWaY So now we're standing on the side of freaks.

You can think you're outside them when you're inside, or believe you're inside without having been in contact for a single moment with the virtual density of the pharmaco-porno-megalopolis. I went to New York in 1993 to escape the educational and cultural institutions of post-Franco Spain, where a lesbian feminist (which was how I defined myself at the time, using the limited political and discursive references that were available to me then) had little to do. At the turn of the past century, New York was one of the centers of the sprawling pharmacopornographic empire. But it was also a vortex of networks of emerging critical and political strategies that transcended frontiers and lan-guages in their attempts to resist and dismantle the domi-nant order. When I moved to Paris in 1999, I came to live in an east -334 Th e mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er aern suburb of the pharmacopornographic empire, where people speak French. And I came to transcribe in that lan-guage (which wasn't mine either) some of the queer dia-lects I'd seen emerging a few years before. To begin with, this consisted of transferring to other parts of the world the power of discourses of resistance that were fermenting on the fringes of the pharmacopornopolis. Thus, one might also say, New York is not a place but, to put it in Spivak's words, a regime of cultural translation. And therefore, para-doxically, I began living in New York when I left that city. The austere, sick, and disenchanted 1990s, which lacked the radicalism of the 1970s and the disco glamour of the early 1980s, would be the decade of the proliferation of queer micropolitics. At the end of the 1980s, an array of dyke, fag, drag queen, transgender, and transsexual groups (Queer Nation, Gran Fury, Fierce Pussy, Radical Fairy, ACT UP , and the Lesbian Avengers, to name the best known) scattered throughout the United States and England were rebelling against efforts at assimilation into the dominant heterosexual society by gay and lesbian identity politics. They transformed the street into a space for the \"theatrical-ization of political rage\" 1 and adopted a hyperbolic perfor - mative style as a way of contesting the heterosexual norm.2 1. Butler, Bodies That Matter , NC: Duke University Press, 1993); Asses, trans. Noura Wedell (New York: Semiotext(e), 2009). The first of these shifts came from early French queer theorists such as Guy Hocquenghem, Ren\u00e9 Scherer, and Monique Wittig. Despite the diversity of their critical backgrounds, from Marxism to Foucauldian genealogy, their interpretation of the normalization of bodies and practices in the Western democracies result in a definition of \"heterosexuality\" as a \"political regime.\" The mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er a 335At the same time, feminism mutated through a decenter - ing of its political subject that simultaneously and trans - versely questioned the natural and universal character of the female condition. Judith Butler shed light on the processes of discursive cultural signification and stylization of the body through which the differences between the genders become normal-ized, while Donna J. Haraway and Anne Fausto-Sterling questioned the existence of two sexes as biological realities that are independent of the technoscientific processes of the construction of bodies and their representation. More-over, in conjunction with the emancipatory struggles of African Americans and the decolonization of the \"Third World,\" critical voices had just been raised against the pre-suppositions of white, colonial feminism. Angela Davis, bell hooks, Patricia J. Williams, Gloria Anzald\u00faa, Cherr\u00ede Mor - aga, Gayatri Spivak . . . were defining projects to decolonize feminism, which obliged theorists and activists to think about complex systems of the unequal distribution of life chances and of violence involving race, gender, sex, sexual-ity, illness, class, migration, disability . . . 3 Dissident forms of feminism were becoming visible as 3.

Such purges had led to a colorless, normative, and puritanical form of feminism that saw cul-tural, sexual, or political differences as threats against the heterosexual, Eurocentric feminine ideal. From such issues, a host of new forms of feminism emerged\u2014feminisms for freaks, collective projects of transformation for the twenty-first century. In a return to Virginie Despentes's thesis, 4 we could speak of the critical awakening of the \"proletariat of feminism,\" populated by nonwhite women, dykes, raped women, gender-dissidents, the HIV-positive, transgender people, fat people, immigrants, crips . . . most of us, in fact. While queer theorists formulated gender performa- tivity and queer activists resisted the disciplinary side effects of gay and lesbian identity politics, activists in ACT UP invented the first strategies of what, in the context of neoliberalism, could already be called \"anti-pharmacopor - nographic activism\": fighting AIDS became fighting the biopolitical and cultural apparatuses of the production of the AIDS syndrome\u2014which include biomedical models, advertising campaigns, governmental and nongovernmen-tal health organizations, genome-sequencing programs, pharmacological industries, intellectual property, bio pat - ents, trademarks, definitions of risk groups, clinical assays and protocols . . . 4. Despentes, King Kong Theory, 10.The mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er a 337One of the most productive shifts will emerge directly from circles formerly considered to represent the dregs of female victimization, from which feminism was hoping that no critical discourse could arise. The circles in ques - tion were composed of sex workers, porn actresses, and the sexually rebellious. The movements created by sex revolts achieved discursive and political structuring in the 1980s when feminist debates against pornography exploded in the United States, a phenomenon that came to be known as the \"sex wars.\" Enter Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin, spokeswomen for antisex feminism, who'll label pornography the prime example of the political and sexual oppression of women. 5 Using a slogan created by Robin Morgan, \"Pornography is the theory, and rape is the prac - tice,\" they will condemn the representation of female sexu-ality as a practice that promotes gender violence and the sexual and political submission of women; and they will call for the legal abolition of pornography and prostitution. 6 In 1981, Ellen Willis, one of the pioneers of American feminist rock journalism, critiques the complicity of such abolitionist feminism with the patriarchal structures in heterosexual society that repress and control women's bod-ies. For Willis, when abolitionist feminists ask the state to regulate the representation of sexuality, they are granting 5.

The perverse outcomes of the antipornogra-phy movement will become apparent in Canada, when laws based on feminist criteria that are used to repress the rep-resentation of sexuality are applied to the first censored films and publications, which turn out to be about sexual minorities 7\u2014more specifically, about lesbians (because of the presence of dildos) and about S&M sexualities (regarded by the state commission as violent and hurtful to women). On the other hand, stereotypical representations of women in heterosexual porn are not condemned by the commission. The sex workers movement reacted to antiporn femi- nism by declaring the state incapable of protecting us from pornography. The decoding of representation is always an open semiotic task that does not require protection; rather it is something that must be approached with reflection, critical discourse, and political action. Willis would be the first to call \"pro-sex feminism\" the sexopolitical movement that categorizes female pleasure and the female body as political spaces of resistance to the control and normal-ization of sexuality. In parallel, the Californian prostitute Scarlot Harlot will use the expression sex worker to define prostitution, demanding professionalization and equal rights for whores in the labor market. The prostitutes of 7.

Beginning in the 1990s, in Spain and France, the sex worker movement, led by the groups Hetaira (Madrid), Cabiria (Lyon), Gris\u00e9lidis (Toulouse), and LICIT (Barcelona) Guillemaut, form a European unit to defend the rights of male and female sex workers. This \"post-porn\" 8 and self-reflective feminism was able to find a space for activism within audiovisual productions, literature, and performance.

This aesthetic and political discourse drew its references from horror or porn films; Gothic literature; sex interventions in public spaces; sex anarcofeminist icons like the riot grrrls; ultrasex lesbian parodies of drag king masculinity like Diane Torr; Oc\u00e9an LeRoy, Shelly Mars, and Antonia Baehr; and trans - sexual performers and artists like Lazlo Pearlman and Hans Scheirl. However, the word queer, which was culturally trans - lated and served for several years as a name that referred to various struggles occurring in Anglo-Saxon and European countries, has been subjected today to a growing process of reification and commercialization (processes belonging to the pharmacopornographic order). In the past few years, queer has been recodified by the dominant discourses. 9 We are currently facing the risk of turning the term into a description of a neoliberal, free market identity that gen-erates new exclusions and hides the specific conditions of the oppression of transsexual, transgender people, crip, or racialized bodies. It is not a matter of choosing an opposi-tional biological or historical subject (whether it be women , homosexuals , blacks , etc. . . .) that could function as a main- spring for revolutionary transformation and the statistical sum of multicultural minority differences. Nor do I mean 9. To mention only one of these rehabilitations of the term: In 1998, the TV producer Thierry Ardisson registered the term queer at the Institut National de L'Industrie in France. The mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er a 341that we already can no longer use the term queer; I merely mean that it has lost a large part of its subversive energy and can no longer serve as today's common denominator to describe the proliferation of strategies of resistance to categories of gender and the normalization of sexuality as well as to the processes of industrialization and privatiza-tion of the body as \"product.\" In reaction to this process of the capitalization of genderqueer identities, inside minor - ity subcultures, transsexuals, transgender, and crip people and racial minorities are asking us to pay attention to the body's materiality, to the management of its vulnerability, and to the cultural construction of possibilities for survival within processes of subjugation and political organiza-tion. 10 Today we can understand the enunciation of queer as a critical moment in a wider process of the production of a trans-feminist critical politics and the construction of dissident subjectivities within the pharmacopornographic regime. The trans-feminist movement that has come out of the queer critique is spreading through fragile but exten-sive networks, leading to strategic alliances and synthetic links; it circulates like a political antidote that infiltrates the very circuits of global capitalism. Tony Negri and Michael Hardt have described the con- temporary world as a single, delocalized, interconnected city with centers of intensity; circuits through which capi-tal, bodies, and information circulate; zones of luxurious comfort and pauperized zones; and remote places for the 10. See Judith Butler, Bodies, 27-55; see also chaps. 3, 4, and 8, in Undoing Gender. Butler herself, whose texts were read at the beginning of the 90s as critical foundations of \"queer theory,\" is qualifying her performative interpretation of identity to emphasize the specificity of the material and discursive processes that produce intersexual or transsexual corporality. 342 Th e mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er aproduction and evacuation of material and semiotic detri- tus. We live in a sort of punk cyber-Gothic Middle Ages of the bio-information empire. During a certain time, our gurus defined as \"postmodernity\" that planetary invagi-nation, although it was a techno-porno-punk zenith of modernity. We are at a point of historical inflection in which modernity is puking up its repugnant ejaculatory potential; we're swimming in nuclear semen in which we are learning to breathe like mutant beasts. The difference between the Roman Empire and our techno-porno-punk global empire is that we no longer possess any ontotheological founda-tion. Some will think that contemporary civilization has substituted an industrial or ergot-like foundation for onto-theology. However, neither work nor production is enough to explain the present-day functioning of our societies. The contemporary techno-porno-punk empire relies on new slogans: \"Consume and die,\" \"Have an orgasm and make war.\" And don't forget to continue to consume and to come after your death. This is the thanato-pornographic founda-tion of this new empire. We are not talking about a dark age\u2014not living in some dim postmodernity\u2014but are talking, rather, about the glittering age of porn. It's already not about the dawn of time but about an atmosphere that is completely illumi-nated, a pervasive gas saturated with moist images. In the middle of this dazzling confusion, concepts such as \"lucid-ity,\" \"illumination,\" \"clarity,\" and \"obviousness\" blaze with a new obscurity. According to neurobiologists, there are four states of consciousness: lucidity, obnubilation, somno-lence, and coma. When lucid, the subject is present to itself The mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er a 343and to the surrounding environment; when obnubilated, the subject's eyes are open, but he or she is disoriented in terms of space and time and relatively indifferent to self and environment; when somnolent, the subject's eyes are closed but he or she still reacts to direct stimuli. In a coma, the subject reacts neither to direct nor indirect stimuli but may remain present to self. Our presence to ourselves as a species could be described today as prosthetico-comatose. We've closed our eyes, but we continue to see by means of an array of technologies, political implants that we call life, culture, civilization. It is, however, only through the strate-gic reappropriation of these biotechnological apparatuses that it is possible to invent resistance, to risk revolution. snuFF pOliTiCs The fact is that we're being fucked right off the bat: becom-ing a punk civilization. The sudden emergence of the punk movement in 1977 was not a simple microphenomenon, but the last lucid explosion of what seems today to be the only ideal shared by the members of what has been called the human species: the pleasure instinct as a death instinct. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, no cultural production has entailed such a punk dimension as much as snuff has\u2014the filming of death (or its representation) as it happens. In popular culture, snuff refers to those films that show the murder of a person or animal with the unique objective of making that death visible, transforming it into public, marketable representation.344 Th e mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er aEverything, in fact, begins as something sham. In 1971, Z-series directors Michael and Roberta Findlay made The Slaughter , a small-budget film production that combined erotic scenes with horror scenes. That same year, Ed Sand-ers interviewed Charles Manson. Manson claimed to have recorded some of the celebrity murders perpetrated by his followers under his authority. No trace of such films were found, but the myth of snuff was born. In 1972, the dis - tributor Alan Shackleton got ahold of The Slaughter, added a last scene in which one of the actresses is disemboweled (fictionally) in front of the camera, and rereleased this new edit under the title Snuff. The premiere of the film took place in 1976 and provoked an unprecedented debate over the verity of the actress's death. Antiporn groups, pro-cen-sorship feminists, and the media took part in this debate. The film, which had no other cinematographic or narrative interest outside the evisceration scene, would garner unex - pected profits. As a questioning of representational limits, snuff has served as a pornographic paradigm for both pro-censorship feminists and antiporn Christians, and also as a formal model of realism to which the dramatization of sex in por - nography must tend: a film is that much more pornographic if the sexual scene that is filmed is real, in the same way that a representation is snuff when the crime has actually taken place. Radically postmodern, the notion of snuff is opposed to the dramatic or simulated and mimetic quality of all rep-resentation. On the contrary, it affirms the performative power of representation to modify reality, or a desire for the real to exist in and by representation. This brings us The mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er a 345to the theatrical relationship between pornography, snuff, and politics. Today, some snuff film catalogs offer images filmed by Allied or Nazi soldiers in concentration camps, Zapruder's film of the John F . Kennedy assassination, the film of the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, videos of the executions of prisoners of war in Afghanistan and Iraq, vid-eos showing the American army destroying Iraqi villages, images of the destruction of New York's Twin Towers and of the execution of Saddam Hussein. Politics has become snuff: extermination by and for representation. The mushroom cloud left in the sky by the atomic bomb, the photograph of the completely naked little girl running away from the Vietnam village Trang Bang in flames after a napalm attack, the sperm-filled lips of Linda Lovelace, piles of mutilated limbs in Rwanda, double penetration, the terri-fying feats performed in Big Brother and the surgical scenes in Nip/Tuck, the liters of fat suctioned from the buttocks of American housewives for the cameras of Extreme Make - over, murders at the maximum-security San Quentin State Prison filmed by security cameras\u2014all of them say more about the current state of our species than any philosophy book of the twentieth century, from Husserl to Sartre. The distinctive feature of the techno-porno-punk moment is snuff politics : rip away everything from life to the point of death and film the process, record it in writing and image, distrib-ute it live over the Internet, make it permanently accessible in a virtual archive, an advertising medium on the global scale. By the beginning of the twenty-first century, our spe-cies had literally stuck good philosophical intentions up our 346 Th e mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er aass, filming the thing before marketing the images from it. The philosophy of the pharmacopornographic regime has been reduced to an enormous, dripping butt-plug camera. In such circumstances, the philosophy of such high-punk modernity can only be autotheory, autoexperimentation, auto-techno-penetration, pornology. When surmising about the future of the planet, Donna J. Haraway encourages us to avoid two kinds of narrative traps of the metaphysical and semiotico-fascist kind. First, there is the messianic temptation: someone will come to save us\u2014some unique religious or technical force, an all-powerful understanding that possesses all the answers needed to transform the human condition. Second, there is the apocalyptic temptation: nothing can be done, and the disappearance of the species is imminent. Haraway tells us, \"We might profitably learn to doubt our fears and cer - tainties of disasters as much as our dreams of progress. We might learn to live without the bracing discourses of sal-vation history.\" 11 The problem resides precisely in the fact that no one will come to save us and that we are still some distance from our inevitable disappearance. It will thus be necessary to think about doing something while we are on the way out, undergoing mutation or changing planets, even if this something consists in intentionally accelerating our own disappearance, mutation, or cosmic displacement. Let us be worthy of our own fall and imagine for the time left the components of a new pornopunk philosophy. 11.

I am pleading here for an array of poli-tics of physical experimentation and semiotechnology that (in the face of the principle of political representation, which dominates our social life and is at the core of politi-cal mass movements, which can be as totalitarian as they are democratic) will be regulated by the principle that\u2014in accordance with Peter Sloterdijk's intuitions\u2014I will call the \"principle of the auto-guinea pig.\" 12 In China, in 213 BC, all books were burned by order of the emperor. In the fifth century, after a series of wars had ransacked and decimated the library at Alexandria, it was accused of harboring pagan teachings contrary to the Christian faith and was destroyed by the decree of Emperor Theodosius. The greatest center of research, translation, and reading disappeared. Between 1330 and 1730, thou-sands of human bodies were burned during the Inquisition, thousands of books were destroyed, and hundreds of works related to the expertise and production of subjectivity were relegated to oblivion or to the underground. In 1813, 12.

A year later, the Library of Congress was razed. In 1933, one of the first actions of the Nazi government was the destruction of the Institut f\u00fcr Sexualwissenschaft (Institute for Sexual Research) in Ber - lin. Created in 1919 by Magnus Hirschfeld, this center had for years played a role in the research and dissemination of progressive ideas and practices concerning sex and sexual-ity. Twenty thousand books from the Hirschfeld Institute were burned on May 10, 1933, on Opernplatz on a gigantic pyre whose flashing flames were imprinted on the camera film of Hitler's reporters. On the night of March 9, 1943, an air raid on a library in Aachen destroyed five hundred thou-sand books. In 1993, Croatian militia destroyed dozens of libraries (among them, those in Stolac). In 2003, Ameri-can bombs and Saddam loyalists sacked and destroyed the National Library of Baghdad 13 . . . The theorico-political innovations produced during the past forty years by feminism, the black liberation move-ment, and queer and transgender theory do seem to be last - ing acquisitions. However, in the context of global war, this collection of scholarship could be destroyed also, as fast as a microchip melting under intense heat. Before all the existing fragile archives about feminism and black, queer, and trans culture have been reduced to a state of radioac - tive shades, it is indispensible to transform such minority knowledge into collective experimentation, into physical 13.

We are no longer pleading, like our predecessors in the 1970s and 1980s, for an understanding of life and history as effects of different discursive regimes. We are pleading to use dis - cursive productions as stakeholders in a wider process of the technical materialization of life that is occurring on the planet. A materialization that each day resembles more and more a total technical destruction of all animal, vegetable, and cultural forms of life and that will end, undoubtedly, in the annihilation of the planet and the self-extinction of most of its species. Alas, it will become a matter of finding ways to record a planetary suicide. Until the end of the eighteenth century, self-exper - imentation was still a part of the research protocols of pharmacology. Animal experimentation was not yet called into question, but an ethical precept dictated that the researcher take on the risk of unknown effects on his or her own body before enacting any test on the body of another human. Relying on the rhetoric of objectivity, the subject of scientific learning would progressively attempt to gen-erate knowledge outside him- or herself, to exempt his or her body from the agonies of self-experimentation. In 1790, the physician Samuel Hahnemann self-administered strong daily doses of quinine in order to observe its effects in fighting malaria. His body reacted by developing symp-toms that resembled the remittent fever characteristic of malaria. The experiment would serve as the basis for the invention of the homeopathic movement, which, based on the law of similars, maintains that it is possible to treat ill-ness using minute doses of a substance that, in much larger 350 Th e mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er aamounts, would provoke the same symptoms of that ill- ness in a healthy body, in the manner of a therapeutic mir - ror. Peter Sloterdijk, inspired by Hahnemann, will call the process of controlled and intentional poisoning \"voluntary auto-intoxication\" and will sum it up as follows: \"If you intend to be a doctor, you must try to become a laboratory animal.\" 14 In order to transform conventional frameworks of the \"cultural intelligibility\"15 of human bodies, it is necessary to evolve toward practices of voluntary autointoxication. From Novalis to Ritter, the romanticism from which Sloter - dijk draws his inspiration for a counterproject to moder - nity will make autoexperimentation the central technique of the self in a dystopian society. Nevertheless, romantic autoexperimentation carries the risk of individualism and depolitization. On the other hand, two of the discourses around which the critique of modern European subjec - tivity will develop\u2014those of Sigmund Freud and Walter Benjamin\u2014will begin under the form of the invention of new techniques of the self and repertories of practices of voluntary intoxication. But the dominant discourse of disciplinary modernity will brush them aside; the process of institutionalization that both psychoanalysis and the Frankfurt School will experience will go hand in hand with the pathologizing of intoxication and the clinical industri-alization of experimentation. \"It would be a good thing if a doctor were able to test many more drugs on himself,\" declared the young doctor 14.

In an era in which pharmaceutical laboratories and corporations and state medico-legal institutions are controlling and regulating the use of gender and sex biocodes (the active molecules of pro-gesterone, estrogen, and testosterone) as well as chemical prostheses, it seems anachronistic to speak of practices of political representation without going through performa-tive and biotechnological experiments on sexual subjectiv - ity and gender. We must reclaim the right to participate in the construction of biopolitical fictions. We have the right to demand collective and \"common\" ownership of the bio-codes of gender, sex, and race. We must wrest them from private hands, from technocrats and from the pharmaco-porn complex. Such a process of resistance and redistribu-tion could be called technosomatic communism. As a mode of the production of \"common\" knowledge and political transformation, the auto-guinea pig principle would be critical in the construction of the practices and discourses of trans-feminism and the coming liberation movements of gender, sexual, racial, and somatic-political 16.

Freud became aware of the existence of cocaine through an article in which the physician Theodore Aschen-brandt described the use of the first doses of pharmaceuti-cal cocaine, produced by the German laboratory Merck as a treatment for fatigue in Bavarian soldiers. There can be no war without biochemical supplements to subjectivity that compel the body and consciousness beyond themselves, in the same way that there is no postwar situation without 17. I am indebted here to the work of Avital Ronell and to her use of \"narcoanalysis\" as a notion of literary criticism.

Certainly, he thought he had found El Dorado, would become rich, and would discover hitherto unknown medi-cal uses (raising blood pressure, combating fatigue, induc - ing sexual excitement, and effecting local anesthesia), but he was also hoping to produce another form of knowledge. For the young Freud, cocaine is an epistemological proj- ect as much as an economic one. Less than a year later, he orders a package of 99 percent-pure cocaine hydrochloride 20 from Merck laboratories and on April 20, 1884, inhales his first line, a week before his twenty-eight birthday. In 1885, he writes in \"\u00dcber Coca:\" \"One has the general impression that the mood created by cocaine in such doses has been caused not so much by direct excitation as by the absence of depressing elements in the general state of feeling. One might perhaps be permitted to assume that the euphoria that occurs in the state of health is nothing other than the normal mood of a well-nourished cerebral cortex that is 'unaware' of its bodily organs.\" 21 However, Freud's project does not get off to a good start.

Freud, On Cocaine, 23.354 Th e mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er ahis mind is to treat his friend Ernst von Fleischl-Marxow's morphine addiction with cocaine. The result of the under - taking: Ernst becomes \"our first European cocaine addict\"22 and suffers from sharp pains after being injected subcuta-neously with a cocaine-based preparation. It should also be mentioned that Freud's intentions regarding Fleischl-Marxow were certainly not the clearest: he would oscillate between an amorous passion for his friend and jealousy. In reality, Ernst could have been a better suitor for Martha, Freud's fianc\u00e9e, but he could also potentially have served to offer an anus for the pansexual pleasure of Freud. It's necessary, then, to open up to experimentation, but not too much. Two years later, Freud is still not convinced that regular injections of cocaine also produce addiction. In his \"Remarks on the Craving for and Fear of Cocaine,\" he defends the point of view claiming that the prolonged use of cocaine does not lead to addiction, except for those subjects who take it to replace a previous addiction to morphine (since Fleischl-Marxow's case has become too notorious to be swept under the rug). What it actually leads to, he thinks, is something he'll call \"aversion.\" 23 Freud is right, but, as always, too optimistic: to take cocaine is to hate cocaine, to fear the letdown that follows ingesting it . . . but it is also to continue to take it. Mikhail Bulgakov, who becomes hooked on morphine and cocaine, writes, \"I, the unfortu-nate doctor, who became addicted to morphine in February of this year, warn anyone who may suffer the same fate not 22.

Cocaine is the most foul and insidious poison.\"24 In the meantime, the pharmaceutical industry is rein- forcing its status as the \"jewel of the capitalist crown\" in Europe and the United States. 25 It should be remembered that we were still in the antechamber of the pharmaceu-tical boom, which would increase full throttle thirty years later with the marketing of antibiotics and sulpha drugs. Dominated by a new technocapitalist imperative, the stir - rings of the budding pharmaceutical industry would gradu-ally demonstrate that there is no precise causal relationship between therapeutic certainty, liberty of production, and the consumption of bioactive substances. 26 During the last years of the nineteenth century, Merck laboratories pro-duced hundreds of kilos of cocaine destined for medical or dietary uses. Between 1886 and 1901, cocaine was one of the ingredients for the first formula for Coca-Cola; and Pope Leon XIII was a regular consumer of it. While Merck was marketing cocaine for use as an anesthetic and MDMA (Ecstasy) to suppress appetite, Bayer was marketing heroin as a treatment for dependence on morphine.

Morphine and the hypnotizer resemble each other in that both provoke an altered state of consciousness, a transformation of the mode under which the ego is present to the self, thereby permitting the emer - gence of other forms of perception, knowledge, and action. The psychoanalytic theory of transference itself seems to be derived from a model of the traffic and transport of a sub-stance between the analyst and the analysand. For Freud, a reader of Krafft-Ebing's studies on psychopathology, mas - turbation, and the chemical production that it implies is the model for all addiction. 28 Alcohol, tobacco, morphine, and cocaine are masturbatory substitutes, exogenous practices of the production of surplus toxicity in the body. There's lit - tle difference between a substance being produced by injec - tion and one produced by the body itself. There is no libido without toxicity. Sexuality, like the ingestion of psychotro-pic substances, is a search for the production of a state of neuronal intoxication. Freud's penchant for the absorption of new technolo- gies of the modification of subjectivity isn't limited to the trying and use of drugs. Not hesitating to transform his own body into a field of surgical experimentation, Freud brought his own testicles into play. Between 1923 and 1924, under the direction of his doctor, Hans Pichler, he undergoes two invasive operations, as well as more than thirty minor operations and a variety of more or less pain- 28.

Despite an unfavorable prognosis, Freud decides to undergo one additional operation: the \"Steinach procedure,\" that is, the tying of the seminal tubes, or a vasectomy, and thus becomes our first European male-to-male transsexual. 29 As we have seen, Eugen Steinach was the most celebrated researcher in the field of hormones at that time. He had already researched the masculinization of female rats by implanting testicles, and by blocking seminal fluids, with-out, however, having yet isolated the molecule of testoster - one with certainty. Although his experiments were no more than summary, they led him to conclude that there is a rela-tionship between hormonal production, sexual vigor, and aging. Steinach's idea was more dependent on concepts of sexual hydraulics or the physics of vital fluids than it was on a molecular understanding of excitation: obstructing exter - nal sperm ducts would produce an increase in sexual power and a generalized rejuvenation. Freud underwent Stein-ach's operation on November 17, 1923. As he would explain in a letter to his friend Ferenczi: \"I'm hoping to improve my sexuality, my physical condition in general and my ability for work.\" 30 After the surgery, Freud said that he felt bet - ter, but above all, he confessed to Otto Rank, the opera-tion had aroused in him a desire for Dr. Pichler\u2014Freud's surgeon and the maker of his jaw prosthesis, which Freud called \"the monster.\" 31 29. Later, Onassis, General de Gaulle, and even Pope Pius XII would also undergo Steinach's procedure. 30.

Gay, Freud , 426. 358 Th e mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er aA philosophy that doesn't use the body as an active platform of technovital transformation is spinning in neu- tral. Ideas aren't enough. \"With 42,000 dead, art is not enough.\" 32 Only art working together with biopolitical praxis can move. All philosophy is intended to be a form of autovivisection\u2014when it isn't a form of dissection of the other. It is an exercise in self-cutting, an incision into sub-jectivity. When enthusiasts of vivisection escape from their own body and head for the body of others, the body of the collective, the body of the earth, and the body of the uni-verse, philosophy becomes political. This political extension of philosophical vivisection can take the form of a thanatol-ogy of the species (as in the proliferation of technologies of war) or of universal and utopic autoimmune therapy (reli-gious, democratic, or scientific); moreover, thanatological management and utopic therapy often communicate with each other, one leading to the other by unexpected path-ways (e.g., through the American democratic industrial-military complex). Freud was a cloaca maxima , a sewer mouth who absorbed all the substances and techniques of the self produced in his time. Inhaling everything that passed by, he would not spare any exposed cell, neither his nor others'. Therefore, it would be erroneous to say that Freud's psychoanalysis had uniquely, and as a matter of priority, been a treat - ment technique based on words. The distinctive feature of the Freudian sewer mouth was the ingesting of all the somato-semiotic techniques, incorporating all prostheses 32. \"With 42,000 dead, art is not enough,\" was a slogan of ACT UP New York, a direct action advocacy group working to address the AIDS crisis. The mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er a 359of his era and transforming them into living bodies and cultural discourses. Through his own practices of inject - ing psychotropic substances, through the poisoning of his friend Fleischl-Marxow, Freud learned that it was possible to modify psychic cartography only through a certain tox - icity. Chemical substances that can be assimilated by an organism function like potentia: they provoke a substan-tial modification of the body and consciousness\u2014pro-vided that subjectivity allows itself to be affected, that it makes itself dynamic in the Greek sense of the word dyna-mis, which is to say, it allows its potentiality and its capac - ity to pass from one state into another to emerge. The transference that is understood to be the cornerstone of psychoanalytic therapy depends on a model of substance transport, a traffic in images, memories, and emotions that will modify a network of somatic links. Similarly, alcohol, tobacco, hash, cocaine, or morphine, as well as estrogens and androgens, are neither synthetic tunnels for escaping from reality nor mere links from point A to point B. Rather, they are technologies of the subject, microtechnologies of the mind, chemical prostheses from which will issue new practices for defining frames of human intelligibility. Mod-ern subjectivity is the management of self-intoxication in a chemically harmful environment. Smoking in the plastic-electric-nuclear metropolis can be seen simply as one way of vaccinating yourself against environmental poisoning by means of homeopathic inoculation. The battle for modern subjectivity is a struggle for immunological equilibrium. The ingestion of drugs or psychoanalysis is the experimen-360 Th e mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er atal ground on which we learn how to live in a somatic and semiotic environment that is becoming ever more toxic. Self-analysis, as practiced by Freud, is above all a prac - tice of somato-semiotic experimentation. The theory of the interpretation of dreams and the talking cure must be understood as methods of intoxication by images and language, while keeping in mind their chemico-material nature. It was only after having admitted that resorting directly to the ingestion of chemical substances will have unexpected side effects (dependence, the need to increase the dose, cellular degeneration) that Freud went back to the talking cure, the interpretation of dreams, or accounts of hallucinations as ways of producing a degree of neuronal toxicity\u2014using memory, imagination, and free associa-tion to induce a psychic impact that is comparable to the ingestion of poisonous chemicals in small quantities. Psy - choanalysis is semiotic homeopathy. The unconscious is a virtual terrain of extreme chemical hypersensitivity, and the mind is a fog through which run electric pathways and pernicious molecular combinations that can be reached only at the risk of modifying an interior psychotropic equi-librium. Knowing yourself by yourself means poisoning yourself by yourself, risking self-mutation. Paris. Barcelona. Seville. Barcelona. Paris. Barcelona. Paris. New York. New Jersey. Paris. New York. Paris.

Between 1927 and 1932, Walter Benjamin and several friends, including Ernst Block, Ernst J\u00f6el, and Fritz Fr\u00e4n-kel, engage in a series of chemical impregnations: they eat hashish, smoke opium (which they called crock ), inject mes - caline and morphine. 33 In every case, the substance must enter the body, penetrate the skin, the digestive tract, the blood, the cells. You must assail the mind by the synthetic route. A series of practices involving intentional infection. Benjamin, Block, and Fr\u00e4nkel wanted to find the key to universal therapy beyond the urge for individual intoxica-tion. The political principle for such therapy is elementary: you cannot intend to hold forth about the real without first poisoning yourself with what you plan to administer to the other person next. This guinea pig principle stands today as a requirement for the possibility of any future micropoliti-cal action. In 1927 in Europe, the ingestion of hashish, opium, or mescaline was still a bizarre, marginal, and little announced experiment (as administering testosterone to cis-females is today). What's interesting about Benjamin's case isn't his consumption of hashish but his psychoaesthetic transcrip- 33. Max Milner, L'Imaginaire des Quincey \u00e0 Henri Michaux (Paris: Gallimard, 2000). 362 Th e mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er ation of the experiment. As Henri Michaux would later do with mescaline,34 Benjamin recorded his detailed impres - sions (in the strict sense of the term, they were mental inscriptions produced by the effects of these substances) in a series of letters and aphorisms that he described as the protocols of drug experiments carried out with the drugs. 35 Each of these protocols, which sometimes extended over time, was associated with a city (Marseille, Paris, Moscow, etc.), with a space that displays itself and is transformed under the effects of the substance. Modern metropolises are on drugs. The production, trafficking, and consumption of drugs mirror the circuits of colonial trade, the processes of sublimation, and the phantasmagorias characteristic of industrial pharmacopornographic cities. Conceiving of this guinea pig principle in relation to the politics of gender and sex implies that it is impossible to advise you to try it or not, to fuck with a condom or not, to get surgery or not, that it is impossible to tell you which porn is supposed to excite you, whether lesbianism is a bet - ter sexuality than S&M, whether I should eat you out or the opposite, whether it's better to have it one way or another, whether it's better to take hormones or not. In the face of the conservatism and moral indoctrination that have domi-nated American feminist, gay, and lesbian politics and most nonprofit anti-AIDS organizations one must develop a mic - ropolitics of gender, sex, and sexuality based on practices of intentional self-experimentation that are defined by their 34.

The drag king plan OF aCTiOn The first time I take part in a drag king workshop is in 1998 at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Com-munity Center on West Thirteenth Street in New York. I sign up for the workshop with a mixture of voracious curi-osity and confusion, characteristic of someone who comes from post-Franco Spain. I also participate in some lesbian sadomasochism workshops for fist-fucking, public sex, and coming out via writing; some workshops for pre-op and non-op transsexuals and NOHOs (those who take no hormones) and their partners; and some workshops to pro-mote the visibility of sexual minorities. During the years when I inhabited the city of the living dead, I turned, in my struggle against an endemic loneliness, to a system for that training and construction of identity techniques developed by queer and trans micropolitics that, I am now convinced, not only helped me overcome the depression common to metropolises but also ended up as elements of a disci-pline of the mind, replacing the exercises of Saint Ignatius de Loyola from my Catholic childhood. This technique of the self is what would next allow me to resist being disap-pointed in politics, to resist succumbing completely to dis - enchantment and to your death.364 Th e mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er aMy first drag king workshop is an initiatory exercise, the first step in an open process of mutation. There are a dozen of us cis-females, assigned the female gender at birth; each of us gives her name and explains where she comes from and what her experience with gender and sexual norms has been. The organizer is a butch woman with short hair who is wearing leather pants, with the face of a young boy and a soft voice. She listens attentively to our stories, but without awarding them too much psychological weight. Although we are in the LGBT Community Center, not all of us iden-tify as being lesbian, butch, or bisexual. There are also some cis-females who go out with transsexual men and a hetero actress who has come for theatrical training on how to con-struct a male role. Going around the group twice produces enough talk to verify the fact that dealing with cultural and political codes of femininity and masculinity is not exclu-sively a lesbian or transsexual matter. The group members speak about their first time, rape, abortion, incest, the dif - ficulties of having to feel different from other girls, the shame experienced at being pointed at in school for being a tomboy, or having too large a chest, or not having enough of one, or having one too early or too late, about not being able to sit the way they want or where they want, about not being able to spit or shout or hit back when others hit. I talk about never having felt like a woman, about thinking at the age of seven that I'd travel from Spain to Sweden like Christine Jorgensen with my first savings and get a penis grafted on, then about the operation on my chin when I was eighteen, about the feeling of not recognizing my body or The mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er a 365my face. Little by little, a denser and denser fabric of voices is created; it surrounds us and allows us to cover ourselves with shared words, creating a collective second skin. Under that protective membrane, through a political magnifying glass, we can see that femininity and masculinity are the gears of a larger system in which every single person par - ticipates structurally. Knowledge liberates. It produces a certain political joy that I have never experienced before. This first part of the workshop could be defined as a col- lective induction into gender suspicion, in reference to the hermeneutics of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud as described by Paul Ricoeur. 36 It encourages us to examine what we assume are stable foundations of our identity (sex, gen-der, and sexuality) and see them as the opaque effects of cultural and political constructions and, consequently, as potential objects for a process of intentional, critical, and insubordinate intervention. This shared gender suspicion provokes a subjective shift that Teresa de Lauretis and Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz have called \"disidentification.\" 37 The drag king workshop doesn't begin with dressing or making up our face to look like a man, but in becoming aware of the cul-tural orthopedics that construct everyday femininity, and by disidentifying from the normative nature of politically assigned gender. Transformed by this knowledge, we put on men's cloth- ing and learn how to fashion a packing with condoms filled 36.

By flattening the chest and making the pelvis bigger, you can modify the axis of the body and the balance of proportion between the shoulders, arms, and legs. Thus, the body's center of gravity\u2014culturally located in cis-females at the level of the breasts (the sexualizing site par excellence and focal point of the hetero-male gaze)\u2014is displaced to the pelvis. The legs are slightly spread, thus changing the distance between the feet and providing a more stable support for walking. Once verticality has been reinforced, freedom of movement of the trunk and extension of the arms is increased. Following the instructions of our drag king orchestrator, I clip off a lock of hair and cut it into smaller pieces, then rearrange it on a sheet of creased white paper so that the hairs are aligned in the fold. I create my first beard. At first, I don't know exactly what kind of beard I want or which kind suits me, the one that goes the best with my face or with the type of drag king that I am. It will be the same thing with testosterone later on; the transfer of the hair pertains to illicit trafficking, to the smuggling of a political signifier. Subject fiction in a flash: these hairs applied to the face of a cis-female offer a glimpse of the possibility of another life. It's a certainty that wearing a beard provides an accelerated image of what the administration of testosterone produces in a cis-female's body after four to six months. Such artifice is therefore not merely a masquerade, a disguise, pure exte-riority, but a revelation of a pharmacopornographic possi-bility already existing in my genes, and it has the ability to take on a cultural and political signification. On my face I outline the shape into which the beard will need to fit: a The mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er a 367Mexican-style mustache that descends from the corners of the mouth to the edge of the chin. I think of Pancho Villa, of Walter Benjamin. I think of you. Suddenly I see it in the mirror out of the corner of my eye: Bob. No mystery to that; it's just me, but it's also a man. I'm not inventing it; he's not a stage character; he is emerging out of what I am, the way I've always seen myself. The difference between now and before is that from now on it's visible to others. I'm not hiding any longer behind the name that was given to me, or the weighty supposition that I am or ought to be a woman. The important thing is not to be dressed as a man\u2014 anyone at all can do that in his or her private space\u2014but to have had the collective experience of the arbitrary and constructed dimensions of our gender. During the first drag king workshop, we're not trying to produce a theat - rical effect or a caricatured stereotype of gender, but to construct a commonplace, all-purpose form of masculinity. Surprisingly, from this perspective, a minimal transforma-tion produces an effect of maximum realism. Obviously, it's possible to think about the varieties of kitsch or camp in a drag king performance, in which the goal is to bring out the constructed dimensions of masculinity with hyperbolic style, as would be the case in drag king incarnations of Elvis Presley, the over-the-hill skirt chaser, the vulgar macho guy, or the clich\u00e9 of a plumber in porn. In any case, the drag king destiny of each participant is an insoluble enigma until the moment when the transformation is produced. The pro-cess evolves in the course of performative exercises in the workshop and often extends into daily life. What struck me about that first experience was the power of the work -368 Th e mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er ashop as a collective plan of action for the reprogramming of gender, its potential to function as a political laboratory, its denseness in its capacity as public space. I immediately knew that I wanted to do it with others, reproduce this plan of action, and that a single time wasn't enough for me. There is a ritual dimension, a psychopolitical magic in the drag king workshop and its performative process of becom-ing, something that I cannot shirk, that intrigued me from the beginning, and that led me with the passage of time to become the drag king MC. This is how I was given access to a culture of resistance against the normalization of gender organized around an array of drag king micropolitics that generated platforms to create and distribute knowledge. Drag king culture made its appearance in New York and San Francisco in the mid-1980s, in the workshops of Diane Torr, Annie Sprinkle, and Jack Armstrom; 38 the performances of Moby Dick, Dred, Split Britches, and the Five Lesbian Brothers; and the photographic work of Del LaGrace Volcano. 39 This cul- ture hasn't found its niche in universities or archives; it has spread through a network of bars, clubs, and organizations that today reaches from San Francisco to Istanbul. Drag king practices create a space of visibility peculiar to fag, dyke, and trans culture by recycling and by parodic declension and deconstruction of models of masculinity coming from dominant popular culture.

I spend six months at Princeton University and six months at the \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes en Sciences Soci - al es in France. Drag king practices are nearly nonexistent in France, Spain, and Italy; I decide to start organizing workshops. Obviously, this takes me to the heart of the drag king mafia: Diane Torr and Del LaGrace will become my first mentors. When I do a workshop with Diane Torr in France or in Spain, I'm the one who takes care of the commissions and acts as translator, the kid who picks up the cigarette butts and shines the shoes; and Danny King becomes the \"master.\" I'm there to learn from the boss and, according to the ethic of \"drag king oblige,\" to make him feel that he is the boss. In my workshops, obviously, I'm the boss. And this power is not to be shared; if you share it with another person or several others, you've lost your cachet as a king. This is one of the first lessons about mascu-linity\u2014everything depends on the way power is managed: making another person believe that he has the power, even if, in reality, the person has it only because you've conceded it to him.

Foucault put it best when talking about sovereignty: power doesn't exist beyond the techniques involved in its theatricalization. Masculinity, an old biopolitical fiction constructed within the sovereign society before the eigh-teenth century, depends on an orchestration of power and body techniques, on a system in which power circulates through shared performative codes that are transmitted from body to body via semiotic signs and material rituals. Diane Torr's technique of the deconstruction of femi- ninity and apprenticeship in masculinity depends on a the-atrical analytic method, on the breaking down of learned body gestures (a way of walking, speaking, sitting, getting up, looking, smoking, eating, smiling) into basic units (dis - tance between the legs, opening of the eyes, movement of the eyebrows, speed of the arms, fullness of the smile, etc.) and examining them in their capacity as cultural signs for the construction of gender. In a second synthetic moment, different cultural codes are rearranged to construct a dif - ferent gender fiction. 40 The goal of Diane's workshops is to experiment physically and theatrically with the ways in which masculinity is produced by an array of performa-tive cultural codes learned and incorporated through what Judith Butler has called \"regularized and constrained rep-etition of norms.\" 41 40.

The mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er a 371In order to construct my own workshops, I have learned from Diane's performative analysis of action, combined with a psychopolitical method that is closer to posttrau-matic reeducation of the body and to the training of politi-cal minorities for survival, starting with gender suspicion and the elaboration of a collective narrative. There is no anatomical truth independent of the cultural and politi-cal practices of constrained repetition that lead us toward being men or women. From this perspective, which I would call postqueer\u2014because it has experienced Butler's per - formative theories but also AIDS, Dolly the sheep, and the intentional consumption of hormones\u2014desire, sexuality, and erotic and political pleasure reside precisely in hav - ing access to these performative biocodes. I suppose it's a matter of my generation and the fact that I've had it up to here with the dominant feminist politics and their restric - tions: prohibitions about using dildos, prohibitions about watching pornography, prohibitions about fucking with everything, prohibitions about wanting money and power, prohibitions about succeeding, prohibitions about amus - ing yourself at the expense of those close to you, prohibi-tions about destroying the house of the master with the tools of the master. For me, being a drag king is inhabiting the potential that it is my prerogative not to deny, without apologizing, and fulfilling my sexual and political desire to be the master, to incorporate those performative codes, to attain this type of specialization of power, to experiment with the city, the body, sex, public speech the way a cis-male would. Without excuses. Without naturalization. Once the initial construction of a drag king imperson-372 Th e mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er aation is over, a performative practice guided by exercises of self-observation, recodification, and improvisation can begin. Becoming a drag king is a process that could be called a gender \"chance operation,\" using the well-known technique developed by Merce Cunningham: finding a way between norm and improvisation, between repetition and invention. When the participants have succeeded in con-structing a masculine fiction that is sufficiently convincing and commonplace, they can confront the \"naturalistic\" gen-der ecology in the outside world. One of the most intense and transformative workshop techniques is experienced when you explore the city as a drag king. Walking around, getting a coffee, going down to the subway, hailing a taxi, sitting on a bench, smoking a cigarette leaning against a school wall . . . A new cartography of the city takes shape; for the first time you can enjoy the pleasure of the public space of the male flaneur, nonexistent for a body culturally encoded as female until that moment. Once the drag king virus has been triggered in each participant, the hermeneutics of gender suspicion extend beyond the workshop and spread to the rest of daily life, causing modifications within social interactions. Drag king knowledge isn't the awareness of being an imitator of masculinity surrounded by anonymous male and female bodies, businesspeople and mail carriers, mothers push-ing baby carriages, young guys mainlining next to garbage cans; rather, it resides in the fact of perceiving others\u2014all others, including oneself\u2014for the first time, as more or less realistic biofictions of performative gender and sexual norms that are decodable as male or female. In strolling The mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er a 373around among these anonymous bodies, all these mascu- linities and femininities (including one's own) appear like caricatures that, thanks to a tacit convention, are seem-ingly unconscious of being so. There is no ontological dif - ference between these embodiments of gender and mine. All of them are performative products to which different frames of cultural intelligibility confer various degrees of legitimacy. The difference is found in the degree of self-reflection, of consciousness, of compulsion, of the perfor - mative dimension of these roles. Becoming a drag king is seeing through the matrix of gender, noticing that men and women are performative and somatic fictions, convinced of their natural reality. This vision of the world makes you laugh, blows a current of buoyant air under your feet, makes you float\u2014political ecstasy. With time, from one workshop to another, my other drag king egos appear: Bruno (the name I gave myself when I was a kid to get into a boxing club with my father), Miguel, Alex. But it is Pedro Lemebel who gives me my drag king name, while I am organizing a workshop in Santiago, Chile, in 2004. Pedro Lemebel had organized a party at his house to welcome me. He received me wearing a long black dress and a strand of blue plastic beads around his neck; he was bare-chested on a winter day with a red turban on his head, \u00e0 la Simone de Beauvoir. \"I burned my head trying to rid it of boldness,\" he said me. I had never seen anyone like him. He kissed me and told me, \"Ya lleg\u00f3 la ni\u00f1a revolucionaria.\" 42 I loved him from the first moment I saw him. \"Lemebel 42.

The country has gone from being a playground for Spanish colonialism and caciquism into becoming a lab for Milton Friedman's fundamentalist capitalism. The idea of a conference, a semi-nar, or a workshop in that context has a special intensity; but I am white and Spanish, have earned a PhD at Princ - eton University, and talk about dildos, testosterone, and trans and queer politics.

Finally, thirty-five women appear at the workshop on the winter day of August 27. They are militant mothers from the feminist Left of the Allende period, and with them are their grandmothers, daughters, and nieces, some sixteen-year-olds, some elderly lesbian couples, some working-poor women who will never leave the country and some girls from the bourgeoisie who will one day go to study in an American university. The Andean cold is freezing on our backs as we have our discussions; we dress and work on the unheated premises of MUMS, which is in a Santiago neighborhood behind which flow the polluted waters of the Mapocho. Thirty voices come forth, forging links to the point of cre-ating a narrative of survival. The story that emerges from all these words isn't about male domination or female sub-mission but about resistance to domination, about refusal to surrender. Making each of them a drag king is a rite of investiture that the Queer MC and I carry out with more devotion and respect than ever. We prepare beards and mustaches, slick back hair, bind chests, and size up sports jackets. In most cases, there's not much to do; these women are kings. They've never bowed their heads to anyone, they haven't been afraid of torture or death, and they could face any little cock of the walk. There isn't much to teach them, and I'm the one who learns from them, about living with pride and believing in gender revolution in a country where all revolutions have been violently crushed. That night, after eight hours of workshop, we go out in a group of forty 376 Th e mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er adrag kings, as if we were in a postqueer remake of Mad Max , and walk through the streets of Santiago toward one of the rare gay bars in the capital. Pedro Lamebel is waiting for us there with his fag and trans pals. The Queer MC sing a Spanish version of one of their hip-hop pieces, \"A New Gen-der Has Come.\" A small pack of drag kings and their friends invade the stage while the fags cruise the unattached drag kings. In the disco, we're breathing in so much coke that there is no need to snort it. Around four in the morning, the police arrive, we start keeping a low profile, and no one notices that there are cis-females in king drag in the room. The party lasts until the wee hours. I wake up in a bar with whores, fags, and trannies, and I'm in Pedro's arms. In the face of the upsurge of corporate production and distribution of biocodes of heterosexual masculinity and femininity and gender violence, it is urgent to work to pro-liferate drag king workshops as spaces for the creation of urban brigades that, in their turn, will set off more work - shops, decode the dominant gender grammar, invent new languages. Creating global counterhegemonic networks for reprogramming gender. No genuine drag king knowledge can be obtained from merely reading about a model for a workshop. Following the principle of the auto-guinea pig, it is necessary to take the risk of giving corporal and collec - tive practices their chance. Such an experimental form of the production of knowledge and subjectivity renders obso-lete the figure of the \"professional\" drag king guru going from place to place to initiate the process of the denatural-ization of gender. The best organizer of a drag king work -The mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er a 377shop is the person who has participated in another drag king workshop and has decided to continue the experiment with a group of people within hir own local context. After having experienced a variety of psychoanalytical or psychodynamic therapies, I have come to understand the drag king workshop as a new practice of political therapy, part of an array of techniques of criticism, reprogramming, and psychopolitical care that we might call queeranaly - sis. The Brazilian Guattarian psychoanalyst and art critic Suely Rolnik has taught us to consider modern clinical practices\u2014those of psychiatry starting in the eighteenth century and psychoanalysis at the beginning of the twen-tieth\u2014as techniques that arose precisely for the manage-ment of \"the collateral effects of this mode of historically dated subjectification that is characterized by the reduction of subjectivity to its psychological dimension and the pro-scription of its aesthetic dimension.\" 45 Similarly, we could say that the problem of contemporary clinical opinions has to do with the reduction of gender to individual psychology. Psychoanalytical or psychodynamic therapy often attempts to reduce the processes of the construction of political subjectivity to a psychological account. Psychology and psychoanalytical institutions use a colonial and Western epistemology, based on strongly racialized and heterocen-tric accounts of the Oedipal complex, castration, or penis envy as syndromes and pathologies, in order to diagnose and treat the frustrations generated by resistance or sub-mission to the political imposition of gender, sex, and race mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er anorms. Moreover, during the Cold War psychology became the discursive support of the pharmacopornographic industry, providing scientific legitimacy to the normative production and distribution of chemical prostheses. It is imperative to understand our sexual identities as the trau-matic effects of a violent biopolitical system of sex, gen-der, sexuality, and race and to work out new myths that will allow us to interpret psychopolitical harm and give us the courage needed for collective transformation. 46 Critical accounts of the hormonal and surgical treatment of \"inter - sexual\" babies should be substituted today for the myth of the Oedipal complex, just as a drag king workshop, in its capacity as a corporal, collective, and political laboratory of production of genders (an ensemble of techniques that we could describe\u2014in opposition to the clinic\u2014as depsycholo-gizing gender) would be a more effective place than the psy - choanalyst's couch to work on identity. Queeranalysis isn't against psychoanalysis, but it goes beyond it by politiciz - ing it, triggering an anticolonial and trans-feminist critical reading of its analytical narratives and therapeutic tech-niques. Queeranalysis develops the insights of Franz Fanon and Francois Tosquelles, of Jean Oury and F\u00e9lix Guattari at La Borde. Queeranalysis is a practice that, instead of conceptualizing gender and sexual dissent through a lens of psychological pathology and identity dysphoria, would conceive of normalization and its effects as biopolitical 46. Judith Butler, Antigone's Claim: Kinship Between Life and Death (New York: Columbia University Press, 2002). Butler, for example, in reinterpreting the discourses of psychoanalysis and legislation, has suggested the irreverent and suicidal Antigone\u2014a child of incest who is more faithful to her brother than to the State\u2014as a political figure that epitomizes the contradictions of heterosexual filiation.

Queeranalysis does not reject all techniques of the production of subjec - tivity derived from Freudian psychology or from neurolin-guistic programming\u2014the analysis of dreams, the talking cure, hypnosis, and so on\u2014but it attacks their model of \"subject\" as well as the rhetoric of gender, sex, race, disabil-ity, and class at work in these psychotherapeutic practices and their complicity in the pharmacopornographic regime. Finally, queeranalysis calls for a collective reappropriation of \"common\" biocodes (discursive, endocrinological, chem-ical, visual, etc.) production of subjectivity. 47 gender biOTerrOrisM The Techno- lamb Model In October 1958, a young woman of nineteen comes to the department of psychiatry at the University of California at Los Angeles. She's seen by a team composed of Robert Stoller, Harold Garfinkel, and Alexander Rosen, a psychia-trist, sociologist, and psychologist, respectively, who are researching sexual identity. The medical register describes her as \"a white female working as a secretary in an insur - ance company.\" 48 The report adds, \"Her appearance is convincing. She is tall, slender and shaped like a woman. . . . Her body displays male genital organs and a normally 47.

Nothing could differentiate her from a young woman of her age. She has a high voice, doesn't wear clothes that are exhibition-istic or in bad taste like those characteristic of transves - tites or men with sexual identity problems.\" In the medical history, Garfinkel assigns her the fictional name Agnes, unaware that he is naming the seeds of a rebellion to come, a future politics of sacrificial lambs (from the Latin agnus) that will infiltrate the pharmacopornographic order. After more than thirty hours of interviews, the entire medical team, armed with a detailed endocrinological and hormonal analysis, unhesitatingly establishes the same diagnosis. They affirm that they are dealing with a case of \"genuine hermaphroditism\": Agnes is suffering from \"tes - ticular feminization syndrome,\" a rare type of intersexu-ality in which the testicles produce elevated quantities of estrogen. 50 Following the protocol for the treatment of intersexuality, which provides for the reassignment of gen-der by means of hormonal and surgical techniques, she is 49.

Somewhat later, Agnes will have the right to legally change her name, and her female first name will appear on her identification papers. From the viewpoint of traditional medical discourse, Agnes's story seems to speak of the management of a prob-lem of intersexuality to which medicine understood how to respond successfully. On the other hand, if we apply what Sedgwick might call \"a paranoid hermeneutics \" 52 to a read- ing of this story, we will be inclined to consider the hypothe-sis that the mechanisms of control of the body and sexuality characteristic of disciplinary medico-legal institutions of the pharmacopornographic regime have displayed all their effectiveness in acting on Agnes's body. Let us compare Agnes's clinical history with the tragic story of Herculine Barbin (the autobiography of a so-called hermaphrodite at the end of the nineteenth century who committed suicide when faced with the obligation to choose a single sex); we could conclude from this comparison that, in Agnes's case, the apparatus of repression, having been transformed into a program of the public health system, was endowed with a new endocrinological and surgical sophistication to accom- 51.

If Hercu-line was pushed toward death (or rather, toward suicide), it was, for Foucault, because she/he was exactly located at the breaking point between two epistemes of sexual-ity. Herculine exists in a rift between two frameworks of the representation of sex, as if her/his body had fallen into the crack separating two divergent fictions of the self. Her - culine isn't a man imprisoned in the body of a women, or vice versa, but actually a body caught between conflicting discourses about sexuality. According to Foucault, whereas hermaphrodites before the end of the nineteenth century lived in a world without sexual identities where the ambi-guity of organs allowed for a plurality of social identifica-tions (which was the case for Marie Madeleine Lefort, who lived during the nineteenth century and whom we can con-ceive of as a woman with a beard and penis as much as a man with breasts), the new modern episteme of sexuality, forced Herculine Barbin to choose a single sexual identity and, as a consequence, to reestablish a coherence between 53.

With an introduction by Michel Foucault (New York: Pantheon Books, 1980).The mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er a 383the organs, the social expression of sex (male or female\u2014 the terms of gender don't exist yet), and sexual identity (heterosexual or perverted). 54 Ultimately, in this causal chain of the production of sex, Herculine Barbin becomes the source of a series of insurmountable discontinuities that will transform her/his body into a medical spectacle and her/his subjectivity into a moral monstrosity. Remaining faithful to Foucault's model of analysis, it would seem logical to be inclined to extol Herculine Barbin's resistance to integration and to be critical about the ease with which Agnes seems to have been absorbed by means of 1950s biopolitical apparatuses. Nevertheless, such a Foucault-inspired reading of the case of Agnes\u2014in which subject formation is an effect of a normalizing apparatus\u2014is complicated. Seven years after her operation and change of legal identity, Agnes produced a new account of her process of physical transformation in which she defied and ridiculed the contemporary medico-legal and scientific techniques of psychiatric and endocri-nological diagnosis to which transsexuals have been forced to submit. This second account is a relatively humble but very effective example of the bioterrorism of gender, and it shows how a sacrificial techno-lamb can devour a pack of pharmacopornographic wolves. Agnes was no a victim of the medico-legal system, but rather a fine cartographer who managed to map out the new pharmacopornographic power relationships emerging during the Cold War. 54. For a discussion of the historical construction of the bodies of hermaphrodites, see Alice D. Dreger, Hermaphrodites and the Medical Invention of Sex (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1998).384 Th e mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er aA few years after her vaginoplasty, Agnes goes back to a doctor for a gynecological problem and introduces herself as a young boy of anatomically male sex who at the start of adolescence began secretly taking estrogen-based Stil-bestrol, which had been prescribed to treat her mother fol-lowing her hysterectomy. In this new version of the story, it all began as a game; when her elder sister began to take the pill, Agnes, who was still a child at the time, decided to do the same thing and took her mother's hormones. Agnes had always wanted to be a girl, and thanks to the estrogen, her breasts began to grow, while certain undesirable signs of puberty (such as facial fuzz) grew milder. The boy began by stealing one or two pills from his mother, now and then. Then it became whole boxes of them. Agnes's second account presents some questions about Foucault's theory of power and subjectification, but also, by extension, puts into question certain readings of Judith Butler's analysis of performative identity to which her the-ory is often reduced. In the first place, Foucault describes a power regime in which a diffuse, tentacular array of dis - ciplines of biopolitical normalization determines forms of subjectivity. However, in accordance with Maurizio Laz - zarato, I think it is useful to offset this notion of biopower with the Spinozan idea of potentia ; in analyzing Agnes's account, we will see that, far from being docile, abnormal bodies today have become imbued with political power and, consequently, present possibilities for creating forms of dissident subjectification. From a Butlerian perspective, Agnes's case can be under - stood as an example of performative resignification and The mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er a 385reappropriation. What Agnes learned is that gender iden- tity, whether it's cis-gender, intersexual, or transsexual, is nothing other than script, narration, performative fiction, rhetoric in which the body acts simultaneously as scenario and as principle character. 55 Agnes strategically omits cer - tain details in her account to the psychiatrists. For exam-ple, she avoids references to her relationships with women, which could suggest the possibility of a lesbian orientation after the sex change. On the other hand, her story empha-sizes the tropes that belong to the script of an intersexual diagnosis: her desire to wear skirts, her sensitivity, her love of nature. Agnes effectively uses a process of reappropriation of the performative techniques of the production of sexual identity, until then used to construct the gay, lesbian, inter - sex, transsexual, or transgender body as pathological. In this sense, we could categorize as queer performativity such trafficking in fictions by means of which certain terms for gender are severed from the authority of medical discourse (even at the very moment of its intervention) and used by a new subject of knowledge presently claiming for itself the status of \"expert.\" We can understand Agnes's case only through an analy - sis of the technological processes of inscription whereby her \"imitation\" of both femininity and intersexuality becomes able to pass for natural. This involves not only drawing attention to the constructed quality of gender but, more important, also claiming the potential to intervene in 55. See Judith Butler's analysis of a case of intersexuality in \"Doing Justice to Someone: Sex Reassignment and Allegories of Transsexuality,\" in Undoing Gender, 57-74. 386 Th e mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er athis construction to the point of creating forms of somatic representation that are alive. Agnes defies the logic of impersonation according to which a transsexual woman is a cis-male who is imitating femininity. She seems to have undermined the relation-ships of femininity to drag queen, of original to copy, of natural to artificial, of serious to irreverent, of content to form, of discretion to flamboyance, of structure to decora-tion. In such a case, Agnes is already no longer imitating, or claiming to make herself pass for, a woman by means of a performance that is to some extent stylized. By ingest - ing hormones and the production of a specific narration, Agnes is becoming an intersexed body \"physiologically\" in order to gain access to sex reassignment therapies with-out going through the psychiatric and legal protocols for transsexuality. Through her intentional enlistment of intersexuality, Agnes is effectively critiquing not masculinity or feminin-ity in themselves, but (by a tongue-in-cheek understand-ing of the complexity of the technologies of gender) the very pharmacopornographic apparatus of the production of the \"truth of sex\" itself. If the camp aesthetics emanat - ing from the culture of transvestism and transsexuality has been defined by Susan Sontag 56 as a critique of the original through the process of producing a copy or counterfeit ver - sion, then we can say that, in a certain way, Agnes is pushing the very notion of camp to its limits, to the point of ren-dering it obsolete. In camp practices, aesthetics supplants 56. Susan Sontag, \"Notes on 'Camp',\" in Against Interpretation and Other Essays, rev. ed. (New York: Picador, 2001), 275-92. The mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er a 387ethics and theater supplants life. In Agnes's case, somatic technology supplants aesthetics, and life supplants theater. Agnes is practicing biodrag: it is her body that achieves the process of imitation and thus puts an end to the tra-ditional metaphysical oppositions that seem to produce so many problems in performative theory (facade vs. interior, performance vs. anatomy, mind vs. body, psychological gen-der vs. chromosomes, social identity vs. genetics). Agnes is a biocultural artifact composed of organic substances, a fic - tion whose very contours are somatic. If we accept the fact that Agnes is a living pharmaco- pornographic biopolitical fiction, we must also say that her mother (hooked on the seemingly slightly chaotic ingestion of a hormonal technology of substitution) and her sister (who has been taking the birth control pill since adolescence) are as well. In taking their innocuous pills, both of them are allowing themselves to live biotechnologi-cal fictions of identity. The difference is that Agnes seems to reappropriate the techniques of subjectification and genderization of her body, whereas her sister and mother unconsciously ingest each of these technologies as if they were supplements to their \"natural\" femininity. Agnes's body is neither the passive material acted on by a series of biopolitical mechanisms of normalization nor the performative effect of an array of discourses on iden-tity. Her body, truly a sexual colossus of self-design, is the result of the reappropriation, use, and collective arrange-ment of certain technologies of gender with the goal of pro-ducing new forms of subjectification.388 Th e mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er aAgnes allows imagining a cheap, auto-experimental form of do-it-yourself bioterrorism of gender that we\u2014in reference to the politics of free software management57\u2014 could call copyleft gender politics, a cellular micropolitics that looks beyond the politics of representation for leakage points in the state's control of fluxes (hormones, sperm, blood, organs, etc.), codes and institutions (images, names, protocols, legal inscriptions, architecture, social services, etc.), and the privatization and marketing of these tech-nologies of production and modification of gender and sex by pharmacopornographic corporations.

In the present context, it's possible to imagine (at least) two tracks of development for the pharmacopornographic economy in the face of which different modes of activism could be articulated. The first is the preservation of theological-humanist political states that regulate the action of the neoliberal (meaning free trade, either democratic or totalitarian in the context of globalization) pharmacopornographic econ-omy. Current pharmacopornographic corporations would function as free market tentacles inside contemporary nation-states (which would continue to see themselves as sovereign and patriarchal) and would negotiate with them to determine the directives for the production, use, and consumption of chemical prostheses and semiotic gender and sex codes. The second transformation is one into an abstract deterritorialized nation-state of the pharmacoporno-graphic industry. We could also be witnessing a process of privatization of contemporary nation-states, which would be progressively absorbed by the pharmacoporno-graphic industry. This would be the strategy employed by the pharmacopornographic companies to escape pre-1970s regulations imposed by states (to avoid the gradual trans - formation of pharmaceutical patents into generics, the more or less severe regulation of the production and distri-bution of pornographic audiovisual material, and attempts to abolish prostitution), as these companies engage in the political direction of new national entities (via the FDA; the 390 Th e mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er aInternational Monetary Fund; the European Union; and the governments of the United States, China, or India) and purchase state institutions (for example, the Department of Health or Department of Justice or the prison-industrial complex) and put them to work to their benefit, refilling such archaic institutions with new content whose only objective would be increasing consumption and pharmaco-pornographic profits. In fact, the pharmacopornographic industries are already in competition with the domestic affairs of the old nation-states . . . The war to come isn't a war between states (Israel vs. Palestine or the United States vs. the oil-produc - ing countries) but more probably a war of pharmacoporno-graphic multinationals against the multitude of vulnerable bodies, a war of the pharmaceutical multinationals that hold the copyright for active principles against the tradi-tional gatherers of plants and their specific forms of knowl-edge, a war of the military-prison-industrial complexes against the racialized and pauperized populations, a war of mafia states against the users of \"illegal\" drugs, a war of the multinational conglomerates that coordinate the man-agement of medical and legal institutions and free market consumption against bodies deprived of nationality, a war of the systems of control that construct docile sexual sub-jects to achieve the total and limitless exploitation of their potentia gaudendi . The history of the transformations of production, dis - tribution, and consumption of heroin offers several leads about the probable evolution of the legal and political man-agement of sex hormones. Although their common origins The mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er a 391don't seem obvious, heroin and aspirin were synthesized in the same year, 1897, and in the same laboratory, by Hoff - man and Eichengrun, by means of the same process. It involved the simple acetylation of morphine (in the case of heroin) and salicylic acid (in the case of aspirin). Heroin and aspirin were legally marketed by Bayer the following year for the treatment of various pulmonary affections, because of their analgesic properties. Although restrictions on the production and distribution of heroin went into force in the 1920s, it was still possible to find heroin-based pills in an English pharmacological catalog in 1949. 59 After fifty years of the repression and criminalization of the marketing of heroin, which resulted in the deterioration of fields, which weren't being tilled, the adulteration of the substance, and the corruption of its trafficking networks, medical special-ists today are developing a gradual reintegration of heroin into the legal pharmaceutical market. For example, Macfar - lan Smith Limited in Edinburgh is making yearly advances in the experimental and therapeutic use of this substance. 60 The changes in the legal status of a substance and the description of a consumer as criminal or mentally ill (addicted in the case of heroin, and gender dysphoric in the case of sex hormones) facilitate the establishment of a political relationship between illegal drugs and biocodes of the production of gender. Sex hormones, whose consump-tion is strongly regulated by the state, are drugs whose use is, if not illegal, at least politically controlled; and their use, considering their potential for transforming gender and 59. Carnwath and Smith, Heroin Century, 31. 60. Ibid., 30-31.392 Th e mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er asex, is subject to specific restrictions that espouse adminis - trative criteria and channels of distribution comparable to those of narcotic substances. How to react in the face of states' resistance to legal- izing the sale of pharmaceutical heroin or removing the consumption of sex hormones from psychiatric protocols? If we consider the close relationships maintained by the neoliberal nation-states, the pharmaceutical corporations, and the networks of drug trafficking, it appears urgent that those dismissed as junkies (the users of illegal drugs) and those diagnosed with gender dysphoria (the potential users of sex hormones) must organize into associations of copyleft drug consumers and force the state-industry-pharmaceutical-drug-trafficking networks to facilitate free access without restrictions to these biocodes of the produc - tion of subjectivity. Just as the users of Agreal prosecuted Sanofi-Aventis laboratories for the serious side effects 61 of this medication (originally intended to disguise the symp-toms of menopause by blocking the action of the dopamine neurotransmitters), the users of heroin could prosecute the state in instances of withdrawal or overdose for that state's having prevented the production, distribution, and consumption of that substance for users in a trustwor - thy and legal manner. This political pressure would lead gradually to the production and distribution of heroin (or cocaine, MDA, etc.) as generics that could be first bought freely on the pharmaceutical market and, in the long run, be produced and managed collectively as chemical prostheses 61. Some side effects include Parkinsonian syndromes, symptoms of anxiety, and depression.The mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er a 393commons . This would ultimately entail a process of a mul- titude-in-the-making, not only of a lobby of consumers of gender and sex biocodes but also a network of trans-junkie experts, a monster-multitude-in-the-making. gender and sex hackers The cis-males and cis-females (indiscriminately hetero-sexual or homosexual), as well as transsexuals, who have access to surgical, endocrinological, or legal techniques of the production of identity, are not simple economic classes in the Marxist sense of the term, but genuine \"pharmaco-pornographic factories\"\u2014existing simultaneously as raw materials, producers (but rarely proprietors) of biocodes of gender, and pharmacopornographic consumers. Porn actors; whores; the transgender; genderqueers; and producers, traffickers, and consumers of illegal drugs inhabit different cultures, but all are used as living phar - macoporn laboratories. All of them sell, buy, or get access to their biocodes as pharmacopornographic property. The sudden emergence of new gender statuses is creating a novel type of conflict between owners and managers of the patents of the microtechnologies of subjectification (sex hormones, psychotropic molecules, audiovisual codes, etc.) and the producers and traffickers of these techno-bio-codes. The pharmacopornographic entrepreneurs, who are among the contemporary leaders of global capitalism, are trying to restrict and privatize the biocodes of gender and convert them into rare and naturalized objects by means of legal and market techniques. Computer hackers use the web and copyleft programs as 394 Th e mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er atools of free and horizontal distribution of information and claim that they should be in reach of everyone. The pharma-copornographic gendercopyleft movement has a technoliv - ing platform that is a lot easier to gain access to than the Internet: the body, the somath\u00e8que. Not the naked body, or the body as unchanging nature, but the technoliving body as a biopolitical archive and cultural prosthesis. Your mem-ory, your desire, your sensibility, your skin, your cock, your dildo, your blood, your sperm, your vulva, your ova . . . are the tools of a potential gendercopyleft revolution. The various producers of sexual biocodes are very differ - ent from one another. Some get off on economic and social privileges, such as the models through whose bodies the dominant codes of male and female beauty are produced. Others, such as porn actors or sex workers, suffer from the lack of regulations for the open market of their biocodes. But all of them depend on the pharmacopornographic industry and its local alliances with the police forces of the nation-states. One day, they will all become hackers. Agnes, mother of all the techno-lambs: Del LaGrace Volcano, Kate Bornstein, Jacob Hale, Dean Spade, Mauro Cabral, Susan Stryker, Sandy Stone, King Erik, Moises Mar - t\u00ednez\u2014all are master hackers of gender, genuine traffickers of semiotico-technological flux, producers and tinkers of copyleft biocodes. Gender copyleft strategies must be minor but decisive: the survival of life on the planet is at stake. For this move-ment, there will be no single name that can be transformed into a brand. It will be our responsibility to shift the code to open the political practice to multiple possibilities. We could The mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er a 395call this movement, which has self-experimentation poli- tics, is a protocol for self-tests carried out with testosterone in gel form, exercises of controlled poisoning on my own body. I am infecting myself with a chemical signifier cul-turally branded as masculine. Vaccinating yourself with tes - tosterone can be a technique of resistance for bodies that have been assigned the status of cis-females. To acquire a certain political immunity of gender, to get roaring drunk on masculinity, to know that it is possible to look like the hegemonic gender. Little by little, the administration of testosterone has ceased to be a simple political test and has molted into a discipline, an asceticism, a way of restoring my spirit by means of the down growing on my arms, an addiction, a form of gratification, an escape, a prison, a paradise. Hormones are chemical prostheses. Political drugs. In this case, the substance not only modifies the filter through which we decode and recodify the world; it also radically modifies the body and, as a result, the mode under which we are decoded by others. Six months of testosterone, and any cis-female at all, not a should-have-been-boy or a les - bian, but any girl, any neighborhood kid, a Jennifer Lopez or a Rihanna, can become a member of the male species who cannot be told apart from any other member of the hegemonic class.396 Th e mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er aI refuse the medico-political dose, its regime, its regu- larity, its direction. I demand a virtuosity of gender; to each one, its dose; for each context, its exact requirement. Here, there is no norm, merely a diversity of viable monstrosi-ties. I take testosterone like Walter Benjamin took hashish, Freud cocaine, or Michaux mescaline. And that is not an autobiographical excuse but a radicalization (in the chemi-cal sense of the term) of my theoretical writing. My gen-der does not belong to my family or to the state or to the pharmaceutical industry. My gender does not belong to feminism or to the lesbian community or to queer theory. Gender must be torn from the macrodiscourse and diluted with a good dose of micropolitical hedonist psychedelics. I don't recognize myself. Not when I'm on T, or when I'm not on T. I'm neither more nor less myself. Contrary to the Lacanian theory of the mirror state, according to which the child's subjectivity is formed when it recognizes itself for the first time in its specular image, political sub-jectivity emerges precisely when the subject does not rec - ognize itself in its representation. It is fundamental not to recognize oneself. Derecognition, disidentification is a condition for the emergence of the political as the possibil-ity of transforming reality. The question posed by Deleuze and Guattari in 1972 in Anti-Oedipus remains stuck in our throat: \"Why do the masses desire fascism?\" It's not a ques - tion here of opposing a politics of representation to a poli-tics of experimentation, but of becoming aware of the fact that the techniques of political representation always entail programs of the somatic production of subjectivity. I'm not The mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er a 397opting for any direct action against representation, but for a micropolitics of disidentification, a kind of experimenta-tion that doesn't have faith in representation as an exteri-ority that will bring truth or happiness. In order to accomplish the work of therapy for the mul- titudes that I have begun with these doses of testosterone and with writing, I now need only to convince you, all of you, that you are like me, and not the opposite. I am not going to claim that I'm like you, your equal, or ask you to allow me to participate in your laws or to admit me as a part of your social normality. My ambition is to convince you that you are like me. Tempted by the same chemical abuse. You have it in you: you think that you're cis-females, but you take the Pill; or you think you're cis-males, but you take Viagra; you're normal, and you take Prozac or Paxil in the hope that something will free you from your problems of decreased vitality, and you've shot cortisone and cocaine, taken alcohol and Ritalin and codeine . . . You, you as well, you are the monster that testosterone is awakening in me.398 Th e mic ropolitics of Gender in the Pharmacopornographic er a399after a seminar on Spinoza, taking advantage of the eleven subway stops separating the station Saint-Ger - main-des-Pr\u00e9s from the station Pry\u00e9n\u00e9es, a disciple of Toni Negri tells me the story of the drug-addicted loves of F\u00e9lix Guattari and Gilles Deleuze. I don't know if it's true, but I believe it. I think of my love for VD. Of my relationship with testosterone. He tells me that F\u00e9lix, who was abstemi-ous and depressive, operated as a connector, a toxin filter, between his lovers' addiction to psychotropic drugs and his friend Gilles's alcoholism. The cis-male who's telling me this story is obviously jealous of the indestructible chemi-cal link between these \"white-powder ladies,\" envious of the postal passion between F\u00e9lix and Gilles. I'll learn later that this version of the facts is partly guesswork. But what I retain from it is the understanding that writing and love emerge from an entheogenic cybernetics, a narcotic feed-back during which the person hooked isn't always the one who ingests the substance. 1 In the La Borde clinic, Guattari was researching modes of political therapy, not to treat individuals (modern fic -13. eternal lIfe 1. I've turned up no trace of any addicted quality in the relationships between Guattari and his mistresses and (New York: Columbia University Press, 2010). tions that are the exclusive domain of psychoanalysis), but rather to treat the systems, institutions, and configu-rations of power. His space for experimentation was the cybernetics of his own love life, a form of reasoning accord-ing to which affect\u2014in the course of an amorous or sexual relationship\u2014creates circuits, designs new electrical con-nections in the highly specialized zones of the cerebral neocortex, and determines by means of associations and mental images the specific regions of pleasure and pain. Love is a map of connections (movements, discharges, reflexes, convulsions, tremors) that for a certain time regu-late the production of affects. The functioning of this elec - trocellular circuit is similar to the tonic and clonic phases of an epileptic fit, on the one hand, and to the muscular spasms and tensions of the heart, on the other. The transmission of an electric current from membrane to membrane. It's a matter of a rhythmic movement, the necessarily regular production of intense affects, and it matters little whether they are positive or negative. Love, a prosthetic system of psychosomatic information, transforms us into addicted, cybernetic animals. The lover is like the laboratory cats on which Norbert Wiener was working at the Rockefeller Foun-dation after World War II. The brain of a cat, removed under local anesthetic, was replaced by a microchip electronically connected to a technoliving external organism. In the time of Proust, the mechanism of writing/reading was the only virtual means of prosthetic implantation of subjectivity. After the H-bomb and the saturation of the body, house, and entire city by media and information, these prosthetic systems now contain the worldwide amplified cybernetic 400 et ernal Lifenetwork. Being in love today is inevitably communicating with the entire planet. Feeling the consciousness of the planet. Love is always a cybernetics of addiction. Ending up with an addiction to someone, for someone, making some - one the object of the addiction, or becoming addicted to a third substance for someone. To her, to me, to testosterone. Testosterone and I. She and I. She or the testosterone. She = the testosterone. Producing or consuming testosterone. Stopping testosterone for her. Absorbing her testosterone. I'm not surprised that Guattari was the one who\u2014enter - ing a philosophical cybernetics once again\u2014would have brought the anorgasmic Deleuze to the cooings of Anti- Oedipus. Like Hanemann, inventor of homeopathy, and Bateson and Ericson, psychosomatic experimenters in Palo Alto, Deleuze and Guattari had become masters of a form of biosophy that could be called political homeopathy, or molecular political exorcism. Beyond philosophy. Philosophy\u2014perambulation, dialogue, writing tech- nique\u2014was to the Greek world what shooting up is to post-Fordist Western society. In a context in which the wheel and writing were the fundamental technologies, phi-losophy excelled as an exercise of the virtual production of subjectivity. Language was enough to produce a residual (individual or collective) political fiction that did not exist before the dialogue was begun. The advent of technologi-cal masturbation in the seventeenth century, using at first mechanical and then electrical devices for the control of the body and surveillance of the mind inaugurated a new era in philosophy as a form of self-abuse. In the twenty-first cen-et ernal Life 401tury, after the H-bomb, electric guitars, transmission of telegraphic and telephonic waves, cybernetics, the inte-grated circuit, viral contagion and design, and irreparable pollution of the atmosphere, philosophy must become a form of pharmacopornographic ecology. hairy arM She and I: two days of fucking without a break. Testogel and lubricant turning into architecture: a brilliant, viscous edi-fice, lavished on us. This is the mind in its moist, adhesive state. The highway system of her body feeds the functions of entrance and exit, under the form of an elastic, semiliq-uid wall, performing like a sequential whole. Her body is a posh club. It's called the HardPlay Space. I've never tried anything better. A cellular Las Vegas. Testosterone in gel form and lubricant impregnate the air, enriching it, stream-ing through my hair. I breathe its aqueous consistency without difficulty; my lungs have recovered their amphib-ian ability from the fetal state. The lubricant reduces the index of friction, limits conflict, stress, difference, thins the walls of the ego. Restricts individuality to its thinnest state at the place where the mind is confused with the prevailing milieu. VD is editing the Mauvaise \u00e9toile video clip. Patrick Eude- line's voice winds around the tattooed bodies of dykes and rocker boys, around Daniel Darc's black arm, and around the tattoo of the relic of Busty's disillusioned love and Axelle Le Dauphin's tattoo devouring little ernal Lifegirls. VD has plunged into the alchemical process of cut - ting the images to blend them with the music. She sends me a text message: I can come see her. I can buy some OCB rolling paper if I find any\u2014and if I'm nice enough to. I can come when I want. The production company is on the sec - ond floor of premises on the rue Saint-Martin. I punch in the door code. Pass the first door and ring at the second. VD comes to let me in. She has put polish on her nails, has made up her eyes. She's my whore. She kisses me, grabs me by the belt and pushes me through the premises. A film pro-duction office is a post for the manufacture of masculinity: maximum technology, minimum domestic comfort. Dirty gray carpeting, shelves filled with cassettes, computers, monitors, editing tables. At the back of the place, the lay - out extends beyond the limit that separates the inner space from the dumping area, a table full of scratches and empty beer cans, a refrigerator, a coffee machine, a row of potato chip packages, some full and some empty. At first, there's only VD, the film editor, and me. Little by little, other boys arrive. The head of production, a cool type with a beard and long hair, handsome but a little slovenly. Another, who is young, has just produced HPG's last film. Then there's another producer who is half elegant, half sexy, half sure of his impending success. Another dude, who is working as an agent and is with his Japanese girlfriend, who's single celled, docile, and ultrafeminine, an amoeba of high design. And there's another ambitious guy there, who's preparing his first film. VD is a guy among guys. She's in her element here. No need to justify herself. The guys revere her. She's one of et ernal Life 403them, at the same time as being above them all. The pos - sibility of their putting their tender cocks in her pussy and, above all, the possibility of her taking them by the ass\u2014all of which seems likely, but which in reality is not\u2014elevates her to the upper level of the male hierarchy. The half-sexy boy keeps flattering her. He loves Baise-Moi, but Les chiennes savantes is really her best novel; if he met a girl like Gloria from Bye Bye Blondie\u2014he says, without knowing what he's talking about\u2014he'd immediately fall in love with her. One of these days, he adds, they've got to have a drink together. With his male insularity, he doesn't even realize that, while they're conversing, VD is fondling my ass, under the mate-rial of my pants. VD is ignoring him and at the same time attaching him to an invisible chain, the way a genuine liter - ary diva does, feeding on the narcissistic contact high she gets from her fans. All together, there are five or six dudes in the room, smoking, talking about the Cannes Film Festival, about the money that the new Avid system costs, about HPG, who's a cool guy, about swimming pools in Los Angeles. One of them takes out a cassette and says to HPG's producer that he needs to see the casting he's doing to find the actress for his next film. Of all the guys there, this one is the most unat - tractive; he's barely five feet three inches tall, is bald, has a beard and mustache and a nasal, slobbery voice. He leaves his script on the table. The title is the first name of an Arab girl. Maybe \"Leila,\" or \"Farida,\" or \"Salma\" or \"Gamila\". . . In less than ten seconds, all the guys are gathered in front of the monitor on which the cassette is playing. The Jap-anese girl goes to sit on a chair at the back of the room; 404 et ernal Lifeshe's smoking a cigarette and making a phone call; perhaps such a high level of testosterone in the surrounding atmo-sphere could be harmful to her amoeba-like purity. And clearly, this is a men's ritual. They're straining toward these images as if they were going to be served entire pieces of heterosexual knowledge-power. VD gets up and positions herself in the middle of them. I, too, join the group and stay standing behind them. I can see well from here, and I'm a head higher than all of them. Only VD is on a level with me. Hairy Arm, the baldie, is disturbed. He wasn't expect - ing the two of us\u2014two cis-chicks in his eyes\u2014to come and see these images. Like hardcore porn, these stolen images are reserved for the elite little roosters. On the screen is a sixteen-year-old girl, who looks eighteen and is appar - ently French with an Arab background; she has thick lips, prominent cheekbones, pink lipstick, long, frizzy hair. She's sitting on the ground, wearing a little black top with thin straps; her low-wasted jeans reveal a couple inches of delicate fat, which still looks sexy at sixteen, and all of it is perfected by the black Pumas she's wearing. She's looking at the camera with an expression that says she's waiting to be told what to do. She's laughing foolishly, as if she doesn't know how to present herself to the camera. You hear a guy's voice: \"We're going to see how you do a sex scene, if you had to seduce the character; and we'll pretend it's me; now go ahead.\" She says, \"I don't know.\" Smiles again. Lowers her eyes, closes them. She puts her hands in front of her face. \"Go ahead,\" repeats the voice. Again, she says, \"I don't know,\" but begins to come up with an idea. She lifts her hair while raising her arms, opens her mouth, closing it as if she et ernal Life 405were pronouncing the sound oh , bites her bottom lip, sticks out her tongue and licks her upper lip with its point, then closes her mouth again, while saying, \"Oh.\" \"Go on, very good, that's it, you see, you do know.\" The camera pulls back, and we see the girl on the ground, leaning on both hands, turned with her back facing the camera. Then a short, fat, hairy arm enters the frame, tugs at the neckline of the little top, touches first one breast, then the other. No one speaks. You can't see the girl's face, only her torso. Then the husky voice again: \"Come on, show me what you know how to do, how you'd do a scene.\" The girl looks at some point outside the frame, as if to be certain that there's no one there. Then she stares directly into the lens, licks her lips again, stick - ing out her tongue, removing her top at the same time. She takes off her brassiere. Her hair fills nearly all of the frame. \"Good, good, very good like that,\" says the deep voice while the hairy arm reappears in the frame, pushes back the hair to free the girl's breasts. They're enormous, bio- and a bit droopy\u2014but almost not, considering their volume\u2014with large aureoles, and very dark, protuberant nipples. The hairy arm now occupies half the frame. In the upper part is the girl's mouth, her bare shoulders, her breasts; and in the lower part, the hairy arm. For the first time, the girl leaves the frame, and you can see other sneakers, the girl's jeans lying on the ground, her Pumas, another pair of jeans filmed from above; then, an abrupt movement of the camera reveals a window, a reproduction of Van Gogh's Sunflowers. Next, rapidly, we can see the girl again, lying on the ground, naked. Her parted breasts are hanging slightly to either side, and the hairy arm is gripping her neck. A short, thick 406 et ernal Lifecock moves across the frame for a brief moment, immedi- ately disappearing under the girl's body. She is sitting on a body that seems to be the anatomical continuation of the hairy arm. We can't see her cunt, nor the mini-cock, and we don't know whether it's going in or out; all we can see are her moving breasts, a little of her hair, her swinging head, and the hairy arm gripping her neck. The guys watching the cassette don't miss a pixel of it. On the outside of the screen of the monitor, the same hairy arm is pressing fast-forward and saying, \"That's more than enough; figure out the rest yourselves.\" The images goes by in fast motion; the girl's body careens faster and faster, attached to the hairy arm. He presses \"play,\" returning the video to normal speed. The girl doesn't try to simulate an orgasm. But she imitates the expression of a bitch in a porn movie, the kind of face she appears to have seen a thousand times and has no trouble simulating. Pressing the fast-forward button again, Hairy Arm explains, \"They're ready to do anything to get a part, and the worst is when they call me back and ask me to see them again. That one is a good actress, but she's all wrong for the film. The girl in the film isn't like that. It's a very beautiful, very high-class, pure girl.\" His is the voice of the Western cis-guy's porn consciousness. The chief subject is a white hairy arm and a mini-cock without a body. A white arm masturbating a cock with the help of an image. In this case, the girl is a simple masturbatory bio-device, a body that Hairy Arm couldn't know a thing about. The name Hairy Arm is born of that image. Hairy Arm has the same relationship to the contemporary pharma-copornographic condition that Oedipus has to modern et ernal Life 407consciousness in Freud's imagination at the beginning of the century. In order to embark on political therapy in the West, the Hairy Arm complex must be discussed. Today it's no longer a question of an intersected desire for the father or for the mother. No cis-girl from the poor suburbs of Paris wants to kill her mother to do it with her father. With racial and social exclusion to be endured from the get-go, any fur - ther desire, above and beyond the demands of the market, to go to bed with the old man is highly unlikely. The Oedi-pal complex has ceased to have any political validity. Oedi-pus has been overthrown by the Hairy Arm. The father and mother are already dead. We are the children of Hollywood, porn, the Pill, the TV trashcan, the Internet, and cyber - capitalism. The cis-girl wants to transform her body into a consumable image for the greatest number of gazes. To get out of the shit pile. And come into the money. To know digital glory, be it only for a split second. She wants to be converted into digital merchandise, in order to be eternal. She wants her pornification, not to produce any pleasure (a form of pleasure that is not only indifferent to her but also continues to turn her off), but to transform her body into abstract capital, into indestructible virtual code: to become an e-body. She desires, with repulsion, to do it with Hairy Arm, and at the same time\u2014with a bit of coaching\u2014to transform herself into the Hairy Arm. I can't avoid thinking of the fact that in Spanish, \"Hairy Arm\" is called Brazo Peludo, which has the same initials\u2014 BP\u2014as my name. Will I become a Hairy Arm if I keep on taking testosterone?408 et ernal Life10\u00bd inChes During a whole year, long before I began taking testoster - one, you were still alive, AB/CS, we were discussing how and when we were going to begin the process of changing sexes. Back then, we were thinking about changing only our sex, not our gender; AB wanted a vagina instead of a cock, and I wanted a cock as well as a vagina. AB was imagining what it would be like to fuck after vaginoplasty, and I was thinking about how to get the money needed for a phallo-plasty\u2014but not just any kind: a high-tech one. That meant a lot of money. For both of us. His vaginoplasty and my high-tech cock; they'd cost as much as buying an apartment in the center of Paris. I didn't want to have chest surgery or have my vagina sealed off. I'd studied the different opera-tions available on the European medical market. The most standard consisted in using the skin and muscle of the fore-arm and a vein from the leg to construct a tube-penis out of it. There is a penis in each arm; in each leg there's a vein that could become erectile. The medical texts call this operation the \"suitcase handle\" technique, influenced, no doubt, by surrealist rhetoric. Dada surgery. A penile graft, in the form of a handle, is detached down the length of the body, transforming the body into a suit - case. First, a flap of skin is removed from the arm and is grafted across the hip area. The body is now a suitcase with a lateral handle. It isn't yet completely masculine, with the unusual exception that a future penis is attached to the side of the pelvis. Thus far, the result is an asexual geography, et ernal Life 409with an adjoining penis. I like it this way. Next, the han- dle is shifted until it reaches the point at which one of its extremities is grafted to the lower abdomen. At this point the body's landscape has begun to be masculinized, but still subtly: the body has a penis, but the end of it is attached to the abdomen. If we were to interpret this image using codes from S&M porn, we'd say that it's an erect penis sewn to the stomach. An architectural reading of the body would allow us to call these proportions a pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter suitcase with a vertical penis-handle that cannot be used for penetra-tion. Finally, the handle is detached from the abdomen by cutting it, and the graft is allowed to hang, being attached from now on only on one end to the pelvis. I am describing in detail the photos and surgical descriptions published by a Dr. Wolf Eicher in 1984. 2 Compared to Eicher's documents, a Cronenberg film seems as gentle as Winnie-the-Pooh. At the foot of a photo, a caption reads, \"All of them have found mental stability thanks to the operation.\" But I myself don't want mental stability; I just want the cock of the century. I measure my forearm. Exactly 10\u00bd inches. Wild! I can already imagine myself with at least a 10\u00bd-inch cock, expecting that they'll have to cut off a bit, here and there.

One of the conceivable surgical techniques consists in leaving the new cock hollow, in order to be able to insert a hydraulic aerosol erectile device through the bottom, near the testicular implants. Any one of my dildos seem hotter to me than a hydraulic cock. Apparently, medical institu-tions and surgical teams are respectful about one pharma-copornographic prohibition: avoid the production of any kind of luxury cock. I speak with the technoguys in various transsexual groups in Paris and Barcelona. They show me their techno-cocks. Some are incredibly well made, but small. Most of them opted for metoidioplasty, reconstruction of a micro-penis with the hood of the clitoris. Some of them have testic - ular implants; others have opted for a maximum of pleasure by keeping their testosterone-enhanced macro-clitoris and their open vaginas. To me this seems top-notch, the ideal solution. I go to the meeting of a trans group in Paris. They invite me to see an Australian maker of prostheses, a Dr. Arienzo, who makes pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter penises in silicone, at affordable prices. He calls them \"sexual-prosthesis camou-flage.\" He brings out a box full of samples: a large range of skin colors, shapes, sizes. They're white, black, rigid, semi-rigid, flaccid, circumcised or with a foreskin. They're glued to the pelvis with an adhesive gel that keeps them attached for as long as fifteen days. \"What's distinctive about these penises is that the silicone skin is filled with a semi-hard gel that gives them a feel and a weight that is close to those of a natural penis,\" explains Dr. Arienzo.

She says that my trousers are too wide for my thighs, too wide for her hand to reach my clito-cock directly. It's hard for me to believe that it's a question of inches, especially because her hands\u2014I know because I measured them with my dildos\u2014measure 8\u00bd inches long. Actually, the problem comes from the fact that she obviously does not yet fully participate in the dyke aesthetic. But she is coming toward me. You're not fifteen anymore, she says. Yes, baby, I'm exactly fifteen years old. They call me the \"little kid with the big cock.\" That's exactly what you like 3. Sloterdijk, Sph\u00e8res , 28. 4.

Years ago, my mother was working at home for a store that made bridal gowns. That's when I learned everything about sizes from her. Her specialty was making articles of lingerie that the virgin would reveal to her possessor during their wedding night, just before she was converted into an honest housewife. Before becoming ugly and frigid, young brides had the brief chance to feel my mother's hands busy in the most remote recesses of their still untouched bod-ies. I'd go with her to hold the chalk and set the pins. That's how I learned the subtle difference between a size and a half size. That is also how I learned to open brassieres and cut panties. She's looking at me. She parts her thighs. She's writing a manifesto with her vulva. Come. Her hands move up from my feet to my waist, verifying that the seams of my jeans are adjusted to my body. They're two sizes too large, she says. She asks me, And what about me? I don't know, I'll have to see. She gets undressed, moves away, and dances in front of the window. sex piCTures At ten, after having doubts all evening, I give myself a dose of fifty milligrams of Testogel.

A tattoo: a heart closed with a lock, framed by two black roses, on her hip. Another: a bomb with an elec - tric fuse, about to go off on her shoulder. Another: a row of black flowers surrounding her left breast, like a harness supporting the seriousness of her heart. Images and sex, two ways of catching time in matter. She asks me to erase them from my digital camera. I take even more. Her right hand slipping into my trousers: short fingernails painted red, a ring around her index finger with a skull and Hell's Angels wings, three multicolored plastic rings from Africa, which draw three circles on my skin, like Olympic rings. She asks me to erase everything. She says, photos are like tattoos. An image inscribed on the skin of reality forever. Each photograph bears the possibility of magic for her, con-juration, the evil eye, and influence from a distance. Erase them. I show her the photo of one of her tattoos. Justine, the dog, is sleeping on the black heart. If you find the key to my heart, you can tattoo it on yourself, she says. She could leave me at any moment. Love is magic, evil eye, influence from a distance, tele-endocrinal transmis - sion. At any moment, she could say, I was a trannie's whore for three months, the way Christine Angot said she'd been a lesbian for three months, citing Herv\u00e9 Guibert's desperate litany: I had AIDS for three months. More precisely, for three months I believed I was condemned to die of that mortal illness called AIDS. 5 Guibert was writing this knowing that hun- dreds of worms were already weaving a sheet of white silk for the day of his death.

She's dropping off her finished book. We come back to my place loaded with books and films for the weekend. She is laughing while imitating Lemmy Kilmint - er's howls, hitting her chest like a gorilla out of its cage. We're in a state of exhilaration common to the euphoria felt by the author who has finished a book, when S calls. Eric has died of an overdose. Sextoy, Karen, Toi, Eric. A book = a death. Each new stage begins with a death. Mourning, as the only alternative to melancholia. VD tells me that the only thing she remembers about reading Blanchot is that the generations take shape around unavowable deaths. She is weeping. I caress her. Her skin is as soft as that on the stomach of Justine. How to mourn your death? In 1935, the Spanish poet Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez writes to his dead friend Ramon Sij\u00e9: \"Yo quiero ser llorando el hortelano ocupas y estercolas, / companero del alma, tan temprano.\" 6 This book is not enough to mourn your death.

Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez, \"Eleg\u00eda,\" The Selected Poems of Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez, ed.Ted Genoways (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2001), 29, lines 1-3. Translates literally to \"I want to be, as I weep, the farmer / of the earth that you are occupying and fertilizing / too early, my soul mate.\" the earth until I find you, I want to kiss your noble death's head, I want to suck the bone of your cock until you plunge into my digestive tract, I want to explode your anus with my best dildo, I want to take you back to the orange trees in blossom on the streets of Valencia, where you talked to me for the first time about how you had masturbated while reading the Manifeste . We're together in a taxi. While we pass the Lonja de los Mercaderes, you tell me, \"You smell good. Your book is the best philosophy book that I've read since Sade.\" You tell me that this kind of intelligence makes you hard. I didn't know you were filming the trip to Valencia. Both of us were invited to a colloquium on the new Franco-Spanish litera-ture. Everything was gray and academic, except us. I see the edit made by Philippe and Tim for the first time since your death, on October 22. You are filming yourself in your hotel room, the hotel where I was, too. You take your cock out of your pants, put it on the night table and fondle it as if it were a wounded animal. You film the neighboring bal-conies, the wash hanging in the sun, the peeling walls, the faded patios. You film yourself as you're giving your pre-sentation. You're wearing a khaki camouflage Spanish army shirt, as if queering the Franco uniform. You're speaking English, despite the fact that I've warned you that nobody will understand you. You didn't want to speak to them in French. Actually, you didn't want to speak to them. You're speaking for a future species of bilingual Euro-alien-Asi-atics. If you could have, you'd have spoken in Japanese or in a metalinguistic, mathematical, or musical code. You're speaking about sex, drugs, techno music. The relationship 416 et ernal Lifebetween all that and this academic colloquium isn't very clear. In fact, you have an idea: since the 1970s, the only major revolution has been carried out by gays listening to music while getting high and fucking. You're afraid to speak about literature, about your literature. You say that liter - ature was invented to weep about lost love. What is your lost love? Where are your tears? Whom are you crying for? What are you afraid of? What's killing you? What could save you? But you go back to sex, drugs, techno music. At one point, you talk about dykes; you say that we (and you count me among them) are also part of this history of sex, drugs, and techno music; you turn the camera around and film me. Now I'm looking at the images you shot. You're dead. I see myself on the screen, just opposite you, like a ghostly reflection. It's as if you were speaking to us from the eternal hereafter. And here I am, on the other side of the eternal hereafter. pharMaCOpOrnOgraphi C genius The 1990s are so far away. They were different years, and we were close to the death that had bound us in its viral laces; and this would next be replaced by a little red rib-bon and a domino game of dollars and pharmaceutical mol-ecules before us, allowing us to forget death while politics was dying. Queer politics as you understood it was nothing other than a preparation for death: via mortis. A politics primarily about death, without any vitalistic populism: a reaction in et ernal Life 417the face of the biopolitics and passion of the decaying body, in the process of decomposition, cultural necrophilia. Queer politics has died with those who initiated it and succumbed to the retrovirus. Like you. Therein you were perhaps right to commit suicide, if that's what you really did, although according to the autopsy what happened is that, without knowing it, you mixed too many synthetic molecules, like Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin did. \"Drug overdose,\" is what they all say, including your mother and the few newspapers that reported on your death. Were you the victim of an overdose of biopolitics, of a lethal cocktail of tritherapy and antidepressants, or did you voluntarily escape this impla-cable political game to transform your body into stardust, to take it out of the market of life so that all of your body that would remain was words, like legible molecules? You gambled with your body, as well. You were playing with death. That is definitely why you allowed yourself to take the venom of writing. Before me, you'd already taken everything. What the government calls hard drugs, the illegal ones, for certain, as well as the others, those hard drugs that are marketed by the government, such as tri-therapy, and testosterone, before me, to get hard.

From the term \"barebacking,\" a collective and consensual practice of penetration without a condom that was coined in the United States gay community during the years following the AIDS crisis as an alternative to the control and surveillance of sexual practices. Today, the term is at the center of a biopolitical controversy surrounding the management of the HIV-positive body and its fluids. It currently refers to all sexual practices of penetration without a condom, whether consensual or not.418 et ernal Lifementalist Left of ACT UP; it was the only way to sock it to somebody during three short good minutes. You can't roll a condom onto a flaccid cock. Nobody has the balls to tell the truth, you were telling me one day in a basement on the rue Keller, while tracing the outline of a cock on my chest with your finger. The problem was to keep getting hard on winter days for dead lovers, for the books you didn't have the time to write. Keeping hard\u2014that's what's good about dildos, being able to stop worrying about an erection, having it always hard, you were repeating to me as your were sticking your tongue into the hole of one of my nostrils and com-plaining that ACT UP wanted your hide, that they'd decided to skin you alive and that one day you were going to give them what they wanted, your hide. And I didn't believe you. shOOTing The hair OF The dOg The end of innocence does not begin the moment we become aware of the fact that we're mortal, and that others are, as well. It begins with the intuition that we kill to sur - vive. That we are predators, carnivores. Savagely omnivo-rous, devourers of everything that lives. Survival depends on our ability to kill the beauty around us. Lately, I see the death of an animal every day. First the whale that swims up the Thames and dies without having found its way back to the sea. Then the disemboweled horse in Gaspar No\u00e9's Carne , the dog bitten to death in I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's film, the chick - ens in Turkey that were infected by the H5N1 virus and put into sacks of lime.

Next, an elephant is emp-tied of blood through its trunk and quartered by an entire village. I'm not ready for such violence. I don't know how to defend myself. I'm not ready for love with VD. I'm not ready for T. I'm the whale, the horse, the dog, the chickens, the elephant, the little girl. I'm entering the adult age when I understand that no one will be able to do anything for my happiness: not my mother or my father, or society, or the state, or my girlfriend, or a whore, or testosterone. At such moments, I turn to Justine and I find a canine solution to a cosmic problem. I apply a dose before going to bed. Taken outside a pro- tocol for changing your sex, Testogel proves to be, in fact, a dangerous game. The problem isn't dependence. There's a slight dependence that you couldn't even call \"testoma-nia\" . . . The problem comes from the management of your own identity: man, woman, transsexual, transgender per - son, and so on. A few more days and the testosterone in my blood, following a rule that no pharmacology book lists, changes into something new. I know it: the devil is in my blood. We spend all Sunday in bed, VD, Justine, and me. Sleep- ing and reading. As soon as she wakes up, she finds my sex with her mouth. VD is sleeping in a brassiere, and I'm sleep-ing with a black dildo that is 9 x 3 inches. She reads the last volume of Simone's memoirs, Tout compte fait, 8 and I, 8. Simone de Beauvoir, All Said and Done, trans. by Patrick O'Brian (New York: Paragon House, 1993).420 et ernal LifeGuibert's Les Zaza, Bianca, Violette Leduc; and then she informs us that, during a certain time, her friendship with Sylvie Le Bon \"had an important place in her life.\" Not a word about sex, of course. Nothing about her lesbian-ism, concealed by her public friendship with Sartre. Dur - ing this time, Guibert's narrator is getting penetrated in every orifice, gobbling every cock that goes by, swallowing all the sperm. Sublime contamination. VD and I read and fuck, thereby producing a molecular communion between her book and mine. Bianca, who's wearing an enormous, realistic-looking strap-on dildo, is penetrating anally, while the latter is licking Simone's clitoris. Violette likes both at the same time: getting it in the ass while she has her mouth on a pussy. And that is how, on a Sunday in 2006, gradually, but with a determined inevitability, Guib-ertian backroom sperm is poured over De Beauvoir's head, forming an unexpected turban. T high Yesterday, I took my last dose of T. Today, I can feel the effects. No doubt about it. I'm having a Testo high. One of the first symptoms of testosterone lies in the sensation that the inside of my body is a fibrous and flexible mass that can spread itself through space in any direction; you could call it an organic conviction, the feeling that muscu-lar intentionality can grab hold of any object, the certainty that any obstacle at all can be gotten the better of. But in et ernal Life 421addition, there is slightly more oily skin, sexual excitement, sweat. I want most of the effects of testosterone, but I can't stand my own sweat when I'm on it. A smell that isn't com-ing from somewhere else, from any other body, but from my skin, and from my skin directly to my pituitary gland and then toward my brain. I'm in T. I have become T. Today, with this last dose of T, I tell myself that things are progressing. VD loves me; my projects are taking shape; we're on a train to London. These are the last days of win-ter. I'm mad about her. We go through the English Channel tunnel. Underground. She's sleeping next to me. Waking, she tells me that she dreamed that our friend Sextoy was taking us for a ride in her sports car, and that you, GD, were with us. We have some Clipper tea. Now it's my turn to fall asleep. Deliciously. While I'm sleeping, dozens of illegal immigrants are clinging to the chassis of the trucks holding merchandise, as a way of getting over the border. I dream that when we reach customs, I get arrested for trafficking testosterone. When they open my suitcase, they find only two balls of hash, additive-free American Spirit cigarettes, and two dildos. I go down for two years. In the dream, the idea of prison is reassuring: it will be like a detox from T. We're like two deer on ice, she tells me, a few hours later, as we're walking in the frozen streets of London. beheading philOsOphy Years ago, I asked a Buddhist and Jesuit teacher what phi-losophy was and how I'd know someday if I was capable of 422 et ernal Lifephilosophizing. The answer is a fable: A fledgling philoso- pher is climbing a mountain with his aged master. They take a torturous, steep route, go along a mountain, and find themselves at the edge of a precipice. The master has prom-ised his pupil that, before reaching the summit, he will offer him the probability of wisdom and the opportunity to embark on the task of philosophy. He has warned him that the test of endurance will be difficult. But the disciple has insisted. The ascent is arduous, and the young man begins to lose hope. They have been walking for hours and are on the point of arriving at the highest point, when suddenly, the master takes from his backpack a spinning blade and, with a flick of his hand, sends it into the air. The propeller-like blades diminish into the distant clouds, then grow larger as the object comes back in the direction of the two men, its sound intensifying, until it slices off the head of the master with one perfect cut. The blood spatters the disciple's face as he watches, astounded. The cleanly severed head, eyes open, rolls to one side of the mountain, while the body, the arms of which are still wriggling, slides to the other side, toward the precipice. Before even having time to react, the disciple wonders if he should run to the side of the moun-tain to retrieve the head, or to the other, to collect the body. Sever your own head. Take some distance from your own body. Experience separation. In the West, until the current time, we had believed that philosophy was a thinking head (the presupposition of a cis-male, who, assuming he was putting his body aside, created an economic system, and whose cock was able to assume a universal position). But in the Buddhist fable, the second alternative is as valid as the et ernal Life 423first: running to the side of the body and, like Artaud, forc - ing the body to produce text. Two irreconcilable paths: an automatically typing head, which needs no hands to write, or a decapitated body that produces, as if by discharge, an intelligible reflection. That is the challenge and the tempta-tion of all philosophy: running after the body or after the head. And what if the answer was in the act of the mas - ter, the act itself? If the potential for philosophy lay not in the choice between head and body, but in the lucid and intentional practice of autodecapitation? At the beginning of this book, I took testosterone (instead of providing a commentary on Hegel, Heidegger, Simone de Beauvoir, or Butler); I wanted to decapitate myself, cut off my head that had been molded by a program of gender, dissect part of the molecular model that resides in me. This book is the trace left by that cut. eTernal liFe Now you are dead and buried, rotting; you were opened, then closed up again; so, you were empty for a moment, then full of worms, enclosed forever in this box, free, as you had never been. And I am coming to say farewell to you, to salute you like a pharaoh, although it's impossible to know whether you're aware of my presence in this crowd of people. Your mother is speaking. It would be more exact to say that she is using language against us, against you. She doesn't read anything that you've written, not a sentence of yours. She is mumbling and isn't telling us anything about 424 et ernal Lifewhat you meant to us. Now you are in your last house. I wish that you were dans ma chambre.9 I'm coming to say adieu. Today, I'm supposed to do a drag king workshop in Bourges. When I informed the participants that I wouldn't be able to do the workshop because one of my friends had died, they moaned and asked me to stay. The fact of your interment didn't mean anything to them; what they wanted was to do the workshop. But I'm going to come to your burial. No, I'm not doing it for you, I'm not doing it to be good, not out of obligation. I leave King Victor in charge of the workshop and catch a train for Paris. This time it's you again who guide my fingers as I dial VD. She says that she'll wait for me at the gate to the cemetery in Montpar - nasse. I hadn't brought any clothes that are appropriate for an interment, so I arrive in black trousers and an elec - tric blue T-shirt. I'm dressed like a schoolboy. I didn't even dare to come in king drag. When I get to boulevard Edgar-Quinet, I see VD from a distance. She has gotten ready for the occasion, and she's dressed like a woman in the Sicil-ian Mafia: a suit with a black skirt, a 1950s pocketbook, a black coat, black heels. I come forward to kiss her. My skin grazes the skin of her check. My mouth is less than an inch above hers. Our knees are exactly the same height, our groins exactly the same height, as she will tell me a few days later. The heat from her body reaches me, before growing cold again. I breathe in her breath directly, while she asks me, \"You OK?\" She's surrounded by people: Axelle, Ann, 9.

But she's clutching my arm to follow the small group of people who have come to say goodbye to you. Where are your readers? Where are all those who mas - turbated while reading you? Why aren't they here, come to masturbate one last time with you? Cowards. The bump showing in the material of VD's pocketbook leads me to think that she is carrying a 9-millimeter Luger. She takes my arm and walks with me to the hole in which they're going to put you. Your casket, the ultimate sling in which you're going to let your ass be taken for eter - nity, glides into the ground. People come forward, alone or two by two, toward the mound of earth that they have removed to put you in\u2014you. Now you're the one who will take the place of that earth, which is outside among us, the living, where you were before. VD walks with me to the edge of the mound. Your casket has been lowered as deep as it can go, but it would still be easy to jump onto it and stay there, standing; it would still be possible to pull out a hatchet to make an opening and get you out of there. But no one moves. People have brought flowers, especially white roses, a few red, which are thrown onto the lacquered wood. But no one has brought a hatchet. Nor have I. That same morning, before your body was covered with earth forever, before it became invisible, I buried the DV minicas - sette titled The Day of Your Death in the park of swamps in Bourges. I put it in a large box of matches, the kind you use to light a fire, and on it wrote your name\u2014your names: Wil-liam, Guillaume, Dustan, Baranes\u2014twice. I made a hole in the soft, muddy earth along the river with my hands, just as I had when I buried a bird that had fallen from its nest, 426 et ernal Lifewhich I'd wanted to save when I was six years old, and which I'd suffocated by feeding it sandwich bread half soaked in milk. If you were still alive, you'd certainly hate us, VD and me, with a hot hate that was as silky as the skin of a cock that doesn't get hard, because you'd know what she and I are together, like the revolution on the move. That is why you'd mourn your gonadic heroism and would choose us as sacred wolves to carry on your AIDS-infected legacy. VD is standing next to me, in front of your grave. When I feel her right arm against my left side, I realize that, in this crowd of people, she is my future widow. VD, the Lady of Black French Letters, is my future widow. Your burial is our mar - riage. You, and no one else, will be the officiating ghost who will seal the alliance between your death and our love under the earth. As we walk away from your body, which has already begun to ferment among the flowers of Montparnasse, I promise you that we will come to rub our bodies against your grave, that we will come to leave the traces of our bodily fluids on the slab; like a pack of mutating wolves, we will sleep on your earth, warm your bones; and like vam-pires, we will come to quench your thirst for sex, blood, and testosterone.et ernal Life 427ABOUT THE AUTHOR BEATRIZ PRECIADO has become one of the leading thinkers in the study of gender and sexuality.

After she reports the crime, she waits. Between police disinterest and squabbles from the health insurance company over who's going to pay for the rape kit, she realizes that the violence of such an experi - ence does not stop with the crime. Increasingly concerned that the rapist will return, she seeks help from her landlord, who refuses to address security issues on the property. She comes to understand that it is precisely these conditions of newly gentri - fied lower-income areas which lead to vulnerable living spaces, high turnover rates, and ultimately higher profits for slum - lords. In this most singular memoir, Leo weaves a psychologi - cal journey into an analysis that becomes equally personal: the fault lines of property mismanagement, class vulnerabilities, and a deeply flawed criminal justice system. In a stunning con - clusion, Leo has her day in court. \"Your front door lock is broken and your landlord doesn't give a damn.

Raped in Harlem, she turns the tables on New York and instructs her own case, drawing in landlords, police, lawyers, therapists\u2014the entire environment which conspires to nor - malize complex and singular experiences. A real eye-opener.\" \u2014Sylv\u00e8re Lotringer, publisher of Semiotext(e) and Professor Emeritus, Columbia University \"Absorbing, tender, insightful, terrifying, this book will change the way you think. In an extraordinary eloquent refusal of the line between the personal and the public, it takes us from the slow-motion details of a traumatic violation to a multidimensional reflection on the institutions and spaces of contemporary life.

I truly love and recommend it.

Dressed in brightly colored tights and balaclavas, they performed their punk prayer, asking the Vir - gin Mary to drive out Russian president Vladimir Putin from the church. After just forty seconds, they were chased out by secu - rity. Three members of the collective, Maria Yekaterina Samutsevich, known as Masha, Nadya, and Katya, were later arrested and charged with felony hooliganism motivated by religious hatred. As their trial unfolded, these young women became global feminist icons, garnering the attention and support of activists and artists around the world. \"Can music change the world?

It brings together academics, activists, and porn entrepreneurs who have a startling array of interactions with pornography as an experience, a business, and a field of inquiry. These essays are straightforward and informative in ways that are unfortunately rare in the multi - decade feminist struggle over porn. It's also fun and sometimes a bit naughty to read.\" \u2014Melissa Harris-Perry, Host of MSNBC's Melissa Harris-Perry \"Finally, academics are actually talking to sex industry work - ers, pornographers are doubling as theorists, and feminists have grabbed the cameras.

Bond recalls in vivid detail how it looked and felt to first discover Mom's lipstick (Iced Watermelon by Revlon), and how dreary it could be for a trans/queer kid to join the Cub Scouts. Always haunted by the knowledge of being \"different,\" Bond began to cre-ate intimate friendships with girls, and to feel increasingly at risk with boys. But when the bully next door wanted to meet secretly, Bond couldn't resist. Their trysts went on for years, making Bond acutely aware of how sexual power and vulnerability can be expe - rienced at the same time. With inimitable style, Bond raises issues about LGBTQ adolescence, parenting trans/queer children, and bullying, while being utterly entertaining. \"Thank you, Justin, for your courage in writing the truth of what you went through as a transgender child in this society. Thank you, also, for your sense of humor. This book is very important, and fun to read as well.\" \u2014Yoko Ono \"Justin Vivian Bond is a lightning rod, a solid steel structure in heels that attracts burning chaos and disciplines it into orderly submission.
