CONSULTATION TOPIC: 12. ANY OTHER ISSUE? Consultation item No 12: Overall, does the implementation of the Regulation reflect your initial understanding/expectations of this piece of legislation? If not, please precise your views. Are there any obvious gaps with an impact on paediatric public health needs? As representatives for Anthroposophic Medicine in Pediatrics we found the gap of not being named in this regulation same as homeopathic medicinal products and traditional herbal medicinal products in the eleventh paragraph of the regulation where it say s: \"However, that requirement should not apply to generics or similar biological me dicinal products and medicinal products authorised through the well -established medicinal use procedure, nor to homeopathic medicinal products and traditional herbal medicin al products authorised through the simplified registration procedures of Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use. OJ L 311, 28.11.2001, p. 67. Directive as last amended by Directive 2004/27/EC (OJ L 136, 30.4.2004, p. 34).\"Although Anthroposophic Medicine uses homeopathic and traditional herbal medicinal products there are some progressions and additional elements like mistletherapy which differ . Because of our longtradition of more than90 yearsin whichwe are using Anthroposophic remedies i n the treatment of children not only in Eur ope, but all over the world we have rich experience of a high safety and efficacy even in critically ill childre n. In our h ospital in Herdecke we use the integrative Anthroposophic Medicine and medicinal products for children without any undesirable effects since more than 40 years! There are studies about our specific treatments ,especially numerous about the useof mistletherapy in cancer patients. An overview to history,treatment and study results gives the book:Die Stuttgart, New York. One of our i nitiatives already works on the acknowledgement of Anthroposophic Medicinal Products in general: ESCAMP-European Scientific Cooperative on Anthroposophic Medicinal Products ESCAMP aims to develop the scientific basis for a permanent regulatory framework for anthroposophic medicinal products (AMPs) in Europe. This includes the following tasks: 1.Development of methods and standards for the scientific assessment of efficacy/effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of AMPs. 2.Elaboration of appropriate categ ories and criteria for regulatory assessment of AMPs, which could be implemented in a draft law for registration of AMPs in Europe. 3.Implementation of the these methods and regulatory criteria in registration documents and product monographs. Foundations fo r this work have been developed during the past 10 years: the Anthroposophic Pharmaceutical Codex [1] a growing body of clinical research and reviews on Anthroposophic Medicine (e. g. mistletoe reviews, AMOS study, IIPCOS study [2 -7]) the first comprehensi ve review of clinical studies of Anthroposophic Medicine in a health technology assessment report [8] the pharmacovigilance network EvaMed (Evaluation of Anthroposophic Medicine) [9] the concept of Cognition -based Medicine [10] the Vademecum of Anthroposop hic for further information see: http://www.escamp.org/aims -task-and-prerequisites.html In Herdecke o ne of our specialties isto use integrative medicine in t he treatm ent ofchildren with cancer. The following study shows the frequent use of anthroposophic and other complementary methods in pediatric oncology :(published e.g. in:Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Dec 1;55(6):1111 -7.) Anthroposophic medicine in paediatric oncology in Germany: results of a population -based retrospective parental survey.

Procedure: This study presents results of a retrospective parental questionnaire comparing responses of AM - users and users of other CAM in paediatric oncology in Germany. The differences between these two groups are investigated with respect to usage, associated demographic characteristics and previous experience with CAM. Results:Ninety-eight patients (27%) of the 367 CAM -users were exposed to anthroposophic treatments or therapies. Treatment duration amounted to a median 619 days for AM and 225 days for other CAM treatments. Most parents with previous experience of AM also used AM for treatment of their child's cancerdisease. AM -users had a higher social sta tus. Physicians played a relevant role for users of AM both in procuring information (24% vs. 11%; P < 0.001) and in prescribing medicines and therapies (73.0% vs. 34.9%; P < 0.001) compared to users of other CAM. AM -users communicate more frequently with their physicians about the use of CAM treatments (89.8% vs. 63.9%) and recommend CAM more often than other CAM -users (95.9% vs. 87%). Conclusions: AM plays a major role in paediatric oncology in Germany. Patients using AM sustain treatment and therapies co nsiderably longer than patients using other CAM treatments. Furthermore, most families who had used AM before their child was diagnosed with cancer also used AM for the treatment of their child's cancer. Compared to other CAM treatments, patient satisfacti on with AM appears to be very high. Thereisa large number of other studies, case reports, articles and books where our experience a nd the scientific background of Anthroposophic Medicine in childhood is well documented. (please see list below) So we are sure we should be named in this 11thparagraph to prevent unnecessary costs and studies to proof the safety and efficacy of our medicinal products again.
