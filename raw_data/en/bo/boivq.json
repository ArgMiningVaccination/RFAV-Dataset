Cozy up with us and stoke your inner fire with a total body healing immersion. Dive into a 1.5 hour sound bath with ritual acupuncture offered by MorningAltar's Day Schildkret Blending gentle needling with enchanting music, crystal singing bowls, wood flute and other aural delights, we'll send you into the deep healing abyss as soon as you close your eyes. Take the journey with us! A special viewing of Day's MorningAltars, an internationally renowned impermanent earth art collection, will be on display. We recommend early arrival to ensure your sweet spot in the circle. OMpower provides yoga mats and blankets, but feel free to bring your own creature comforts that make you feel right at home. Wear warm, loose-fitting clothes, lean back and rejuvenate your qi surrounded by new friends, your besties and your loves. Price: $45. Pre-registration highly recommended.
