It is essentially milk (dairy or plant-based) warmed with turmeric, a powerhouse spice with multiple documented health benefits. The essential recipe is simply milk (one cup) with turmeric (\u00bc to \u00bd teaspoon) brought to a simmer over low to medium heat. Along with turmeric, additional ingredients such as honey, cinnamon, ginger and cardamom can be added \u2014 many like a pinch of fresh black pepper as well. Fans of golden milk say that it aids sleep by soothing digestion, fights colds and flu, and lifts low moods. Researchers are cracking the code on why this simple drink has been so popular for centuries in India, and is gaining fans in the West. The turmeric, loaded with a phytochemical called \"curcumin,\" is the catalyst for golden milk benefits. Turmeric = Curcumin According to \" [Medical News Today](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324181.php?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_country=US&utm_hcp=no&utm_campaign=MNT%20Weekly%20Full%20%28non-HCP%20US%29%20-%20OLD%20STYLE%202019-01-16&utm_term=MNT%20Weekly%20News%20%28non-HCP%20US%29),\" research has confirmed that curcumin, the active component of turmeric, a common spice in Asian and Indian cuisines, supports health in multiple ways. - - Anti-Inflammatory: Curcumin has been shown to reduce the inflammation which been linked to a broad range of diseases, including cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's. A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22407780)on rheumatoid arthritis and curcumin showed that the group of patients receiving the nutrient showed much less pain and swelling compared to those who did not. The researchers also confirmed that curcumin is safe, with no adverse effects. - Anti-Inflammatory: Curcumin has been shown to reduce the inflammation which been linked to a broad range of diseases, including cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's. A - Mood Regulation: Curcumin has also been shown to improve mood \u2014 a randomized, controlled [trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23832433)showed that curcumin \"may be used as a safe and effective modality in patients with major depressive disorder.\" - Antioxidant: Curcumin, with its antioxidant properties, helps protect living cells from free-radical damage from processed foods and environmental stressors. Additional Ingredients and their Benefits - - Cinnamon has been [proven](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4167597/)to protect brain function in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's, and slows memory loss. This spice is loaded with polyphenols, giving the aromatic bark powerful antioxidant properties. Cinnamon [also](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14633804)fights heart disease by reducing LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and has been [shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4003790/)to reduce blood pressure. These studies merely scratch the surface of cinnamon's value as a medicinal plant. - Cinnamon has been - Ginger, with its gut-soothing action, helps to calm and relax the digestive system. This helps prepare the body for rest and sleep. Ginger is a cousin of turmeric, and shares anti-inflammation characteristics. The active ingredient, gingerol, relieves nausea and vomiting, and is used as a natural treatment for sea sickness. Ginger has been found to be effective for [morning sickness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3995184/), [post-surgical](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16389016)and [chemotherapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20842754)nausea. - Raw, High Quality Honey is full of antioxidants. The antioxidant compounds unique to raw honey have been [linked](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3005390/)to preventing heart disease and lowering blood pressure. It has also been found to improve [cholesterol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15117561)and lower [triglycerides](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15117561). Raw honey can help suppress coughing, and consuming locally-sourced honey may relieve allergies by delivering homeopathic amounts of offending pollen, triggering a healthy immune response. - Cardamom is another signature spice flavor in Indian recipes \u2014 and unexpectedly in Scandinavian foods. Vikings opening trade routes to Asia through Istanbul returned home with cardamom they discovered in Constantinople's spice markets \u2014 it was quickly embraced and became an essential ingredient in Scandinavian foods. Sweden is the world's third largest consumer of the potent spice. Cardamom is another cousin of turmeric, and carries many of curcumin's benefits such as antioxidant action, anti-inflammatory properties, and antibacterial effects, but it has also been [found](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/50874100_Antimicrobial_Activity_of_Amomum_subulatum_and_Elettaria_cardamomum_Against_Dental_Caries_Causing_Microorganisms)to fight bad breath, cavities, and stomach ulcers. - Black Pepper has been in use for centuries in both culinary and medical traditions. Ayurvedic medicine values black pepper for its ability to pacify kapha and vata [doshas](https://www.gaia.com/video/your-bodys-blueprint-doshas)while increasing pitta, the third dosha. The vedics also use black pepper for cleansing, weight loss, respiratory health, and healthy joints. Black pepper can be considered a superfood because of its high amounts of minerals (zinc, phosphorous, manganese, calcium, iron, copper, choline.) Next Article Kapha Reducing Breakfast Porridge Are you feeling a little heavy and a little sluggish? Are you craving sunshine and warmth and wish for Spring to put a spring in your step? It's not surprising that many people in the Northern hemisphere take off to warm and tropical destinations in February and March. At this point many of us have had enough of the cold and damp climate and are ready to \"dry up and warm up\" from the outside in and kick our natural Vitamin D production into a higher gear again. If you suffer from SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) you may already be supplementing with additional Vitamin D and possibly even reaching for other means such as commercially available sources of full spectrum sunlight. Alternately, you may subscribe to a regular sauna practice which is helpful in driving the dampness, [Kapha](/video/kapha-flow), out of your bones and joints and helps to release the sluggish feeling that can so easily settle on our body-mind. Of course you can alleviate some of these [Kapha traits](/article/yoga-your-doshas-kapha), such as a feeling of cold and damp, sluggishness of body and mind, and a craving for sun, light, and warmth, by feeding your body the right nutrients to warm up from the inside out rather than only from outside in. A good way to look at it is much like the stoking of a furnace. If you are living in a cool climate which sports cold and damp winters that drag well into the February and March months, you may be served well by avoiding foods that are inherently cold, such as raw fruit and salads, anything eaten right out of the fridge, ice creams and also cold water. In Ayurveda we are trying to counter unwanted qualities with their opposite. Kapha is mainly cold and wet in nature, thus we find Kapha prominent in [late Winter](/video/winter-seasonal-vinyasa) and early Spring when we are moving away from the dry and harsher cold and into the time of year when the earth is getting ready again for new growth. Kapha is also heavy in nature and a person with this body-type may find that their metabolism is a little sluggish and their digestion is quite slow. Foods that can thoroughly spark your inner furnace and put a smile on your face are those that are steamed or slightly cooked, warm stews and soups that are rich in nutrients yet easy on your digestive load. Make sure to include plenty of spices such as ginger, garlic, chili or cayenne (careful if you are of [Pitta constitution](/article/yoga-your-doshas-pitta)). Chili and cayenne also contain capsaicin which is known to have an effect similar to endorphins in your body and therefore has been noted as a natural metabolic stimulant, mood enhancer, and in some cultures as an aphrodisiac. Here is a recipe for a delicious breakfast porridge that packs a mild punch and gives you a cozy start to your day without giving you the weighed down feeling a warm meal can otherwise give you in the morning. The [millet](/article/millet-porridge) in this recipe has a dry quality that counters the heavy and moist quality of Kapha. The spices are mostly pungent which also works to balance Kapha, especially if you chose to add a little chili or cayenne to your porridge. Even though the sweet quality of honey has a building (or Kapha increasing effect on us) it is helpful in this recipe as raw honey has a pungent post-digestive effect, which means that it helps alleviate the Kapha and scrape it out of your cells. Kapha Reducing Breakfast Porridge Serves 1 Ingredients: - 1/4 cup dry millet - 1 small apple, the kind that's in season - Pinch of ground clove - Pinch of dry ginger - 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon - Pinch of ground cardamom - Pinch of ground chili - optional - 1 cup of water - 1 tsp raw honey Directions: Cook all ingredients on low heat for about 20 minutes. Check consistency and add water if you like. Add a teaspoon of raw honey just before serving. I like to top my porridge with some toasted walnuts (toast walnut halves at 350 F for 16 minutes, let cool and use as desired). This Kapha reducing breakfast is fixed to give you a solid start and warm you up on a cold morning, and leaves you feeling satisfied and alert for what the day holds for you without weighing you down.
