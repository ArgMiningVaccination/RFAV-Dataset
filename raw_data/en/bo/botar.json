All clothing items are washed in cold water and dried on high heat. Items such as formed hats (fedoras, brimmed hats), leather jackets, belts, shoes, will be sprayed with bed bug spray. Processing may vary 24-48 hours. What is Withdrawal Management? The sustained use of some substances, including alcohol, cause changes within the body. Once the use of those substances is discontinued, those changes can result in discomfort, pain and sometimes life-threatening complications. These are known as acute withdrawal symptoms and may include anxiety, restlessness, joint pain, stomach cramps, nausea, insomnia and others. The goal of withdrawal management is to alleviate these symptoms and help patients safely and effectively cease their use of drugs or alcohol. What medications are dispensed during withdrawal management? Several prescription medications are used during the withdrawal process to help alleviate the symptoms of withdrawal. The medications used are FDA approved and help prevent seizures, lower anxiety, reduce muscle and body aches, counteract sleeplessness, and reduce abdominal discomfort. We also offer a variety of over-the-counter medications for common ailments including headache, diarrhea, upset stomach, allergies, heartburn, and constipation. We encourage patients to notify their nurse when experiencing any discomfort. Does Fora Health offer withdrawal management for opioid use disorder? Yes. Fora Health has a medical team well-versed in managing and supporting people withdrawing from opioid use. What is withdrawal management treatment like? Our withdrawal management facility is co-ed. Beds are set-up dormitory style to ensure effective and safe care for a maximum of 16 people at a time. A nurse is assigned to patients at each shift, and everyone receives 24/7 support during treatment. Often patients enrolled in withdrawal management are not feeling that great, so the environment is calm, quiet, and lacks stimulation. However, games, puzzles, television and reading materials are available. Personal electronic devices are not accessible during treatment. Patients are expected to engage in addiction, health and education groups near the completion of withdrawal management to help prepare them for successful transition to another level of care. How long does withdrawal take? In general, a person can expect to be in withdrawal management for an average of 3-5 days. The length of stay varies from person to person and depends on use history and type of substance. One of the benefits of withdrawal management is 24/7 care and regular assessments by clinical staff. Patients no longer require withdrawal management when the severity of withdrawal symptoms has decreased enough to allow a person to be comfortable without medication and/or medical monitoring. Can patients make phone calls or receive visitors while in Withdrawal Management? Phone calls, messages and family visits do not take place during withdrawal management. In most cases, calls are restricted to those made on the final day of managed care to facilitate transportation, aftercare arrangements and other issues related to the transition out of the withdrawal management program. These calls are made with a nurse or case manager present for support. Withdrawal Management last between 3-5 days and these communication restrictions help people stay focused on the program.
