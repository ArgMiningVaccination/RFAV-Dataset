Among other things , the family must decide where the child will live and the extent of contact the child will have with each parent. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the importance of different custody arrangements on children's and adolescents' well -being, men- tal health, and relationship to parents, as well as coparenting and pa- rental conflict . We answered three research question (Nordic studies): 1) What are the consequences of extensive contact/joint physical custody compared to less contact/ sole physical custody ? We included one cohort study . There is limited evidence: we cannot say whether there are dif- ferences in children's mental health between custody arrang ements. 2) What are parents', children's, and adolescents ' experiences of and pref- erences for different custody arrangements? We included 17 qualitative studies of families with joint physical custody. The studies identified many themes of importance to children 's and adolescent s' experience of joint custody , including child -parent relationships and parental rela- tionship, practicalities, distance between homes, flexibility, sense of be- longing and safeguarding the child ren's wishes . 3) Which factors related to different custody arrangements can be associ- ated with or influence children 's and adolescents ' lives and mental health as well as coparenting and parental conflict? We included 23 quantita- tive studies, which assessed the association between different custody arrangements and relevant outcomes for children and parents. The fac- tors that appeared most to influence (attenuate) the association s be- tween custody arrangements and outcomes (e.g., mental health), were relationsh ips within the family (child -parent, coparenting/parental conflict) and family preconditions ( parental health and finances ). The complex interaction between prominent themes and factors in the qualitative and quantitative studies suggests that a particular custody arrangement can be experienced very differently from one child to an- other. B ased on the current evidence it m ay appear that relations within the family, as well as communication and conflict between the parent s, perhaps are as important for how children and youth fare, as the custo dy arrangements themselves . Title: Custody and living ar- rangements after par-ents separate: implica-tions for children and adolescents : a system- atic review ------------------------------- Publisher: The Norwegian Institute of Public Health conducted the review based on a commission from The Norwegian Directorate for Children, Youth and Family Affairs Updated: Last search for studies: April 2022. ------------------------------- (NIPH) 10 Executive summary (English) Executive summary (English) Introduction When parents separate, there are major consequences for children and adolescents . Among other things , the family must decide where the child or adolescent will live and the extent of contact the child will have wit h each parent. Parents choose visitation and custody arrangements based on their current life situation , family experiences , the child's needs, and other aspects. Permanent custody relates to which decisions the par- ents can make on behalf of the child. Joint physical custody means that the child has residency with both parents, although in practice the child does not necessarily live half of the time with each parent . There is an increase in families choosing joint physical custody or extensive contact with both parents (at least one third with each). Currently, parents may choose to have joint physical custody or not . In the fall of 2021, the gov- ernment proposed to consider making joint physical custody the main rule in the new Act relating to Children and Parents (the Children Act) . The present systematic review was commissioned by Bufdir and will contribute to the government's consideration . Objective The objective of this systematic review was to summarize the research on different cus- tody and living arrangements that affect children and adolescent s. The systematic re- view is an update and an expansion of an earlier systematic review published by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. The research questions in the present sy stematic review are: 1. a) What are the consequences of extensive contact with both parents compared to less contact with one of the parents, for children's and adolescents ' (0-19 years) well -being, mental health and relationship with parents, as well as coparenting and parental conflict? b) What are the consequences of joint physical custody compared to sole physical custody for children 's and adolescents ' (0-19 years) well- being, mental health and relationship with parents, as well as coparenting and parental conflict? 2. What are parents', children's and adolescents ' experiences of and preferences for different custody arrangements? 3. Which factors related to different custody arrangements can be associated with or influence children 's and adolescents ' lives and mental health as well as coparenting and parental conflict? Method The three research questions involved slightly different inclusion criteria, mainly: - Question 1 (consequences): longitudinal cohort studies published 2016 -2022 - Question 2 (experiences): qualitative studies published 2010 -2022 11 Executive summary (English) - Question 3 (factors): quantitative studies (cross -sectional and cohort) published 2010 -2022 A research librarian, in collaboration with the project group, prepared a joint search strategy for all three research questions. We searched in standard databases such as MEDLINE, PsycInfo, EMBASE, Sociological Abstracts and Social Services Abstracts, in addition to e.g., Nordic science archives, Google Scholar, selected relevant journals and reference lists of relevant publications. Time constraints necess itated limit ing the re- view's scope . Thus, in line with the pro tocol and in collaboratio n with the commis- sioner, we chose to include only Nordic studies for questions 2 and 3. Additionally , we decided that questions 2 and 3 would be answered with an abridged procedure. We conducted a systematic review for question 1 on consequences, including assessment s of risk of bias and certainty of the evidence (GRADE). For questions 2 and 3, we as-sessed the studies' methodological limitations/risk of bias, extracted results, and sum- marized the findings narratively. F indings on themes and factors from the qualitative and quantitative studies where combined. Results The literature search yielded 2,743 references, which we assessed on title and abstract level. We assessed 19 4 full-text publications and included a total of 40 Nordic studies. Question 1 about consequences : We i ncluded one prospective cohort study. It had very high risk of bias. Our results show that it is uncertain whether potential changes in chil- dren's mental health from age 7 to 11 are associated with custody arrangements . Question 2 about experiences : We included 17 qualitative studies . All concerned joint physical custody. Seven stu dies had minor or minor /moderate methodological limita- tions , thus, we emphasized these in our analyses and presentation of findings. We iden- tified three main categories of themes: - Perspectives on joint physical custody . Children and parents had somewhat divirging perspect ives, but emphasized how flexibility, fairness and rigidity could be important . Children e mphasized that they would like to have information and the opportunity to state their opinion, but not necessarily be given the responsibility to decide (depending on the child's age). - Practical conditions . Living in two homes, often with diverging rules and routines , were challeng ing for some children . This partly depended on characteri stics (e.g. personality) of both children and parents. Many children emphasized aspects of the e xchange days , such as frequency of exchanges, day of the week it happened and practices surrounding the exchange. Distance between homes gave rise to practical challenges, and affected social relationships with friends and other family members, as well as access to leisure activities and networks . How the arrangement (joint physical custody ) was practiced often changed over time, without resulting in a change in the agreement on joint physical custody. - Relationships . Many children and parents metioned coparenting, parental conflict, willingness to communicate and communication style . In order to have positive experiences with joint physical custody , children emphasized e.g. a low degree of parental conflict, good parental relationships and coparenting. The parental relationship also affected the child's tho ughts about their opportunitites to influenc e their own daily life. For some , their relationship with each of the parents 12 Executive summary (English) was characterized by feelings of loyalty, thoughts about what was fair for the parents, a desire to ensure contact with both parents and not creat ing or worsen ing any conflict. Most of the children were satisfied with joint physical custody as they valued equal contact with both parents. For most themes , there were children who expressed both positive and negative senti- ments , and the children differed about what was important to them ; thus , there were differences in how their everyday life in joint physical custody unfolded. Overall, differ- ences within the themes related to the child's age and time in joint physical custody . Question 3 about factors : We included 23 quantitative studies of which we assessed 21 studies as having a high or high/unclear risk of bias. The studies compared different custody arrangements in relation to child and adolescent outcomes (e.g., mental health), and explored wh ich factors influenced these assoc iations. In particular, factors that seemed to influence the association between custody arrangement and outcome were relational factors and family demographics : The relationship between parents and the child -parent relationship appeared to be importan t, and family preconditions, such as finances and parental health , appeared to be somewhat important . This indi- cates that when such factors were taken into account , there were fewer or no differ- ences between different custody arrangements with respect to these outcomes (i.e., the associations diminished, and the groups became more similar ). Discussion and conclusion When assessing the quantitative and qualitative studies together , we found that both show the importance of relations, between children and parents, and between the par- ents. These relations seem to be important for which custody arrangement is chosen, how the arrangement works, and th e relations themselves appear to impact children 's and adolescents ' mental health. It seems that parental finances influence the associa- tion between custody arrangement and outcomes in children and adolescents , such as mental health. The current evidence is insufficient to draw any clear conclusions about whether there are differences between children in different visitation - and custody arrangements with regard to well -being, mental health, relationship with parents or between parents . The qualitative studies indicat e that certain factors, such as the parent -child relation- ship and degree of parental conflict, are important for children to have a positive expe-rience of joint physical custody, while the findings concerning other factors, such as flexibility, are more nuanced. In the quantitative studies , it seemed that relationships and family pre conditions (e.g. , finances) were most influen tial. The complex interplay between factors and themes identified as central in the quantitative and qualitative studies, suggests that there are multiple important aspects for how custody arrange- ments work and are experienced by a child. Based on the findings in this systematic re- view , we cannot say that the services that meet families where parents have separated can recommend one custody arrangement over another, without taking the individual family into consideration. Relationships within the family, communication and conflicts between the parents are perhaps as important for h ow children and adolescents feel as the custody arrangements themselves. 13 Forord om farskap er at faren til barnet er den som var gift med moren da barnet f\u00f8dt er f\u00f8dt 1. samboende foreldre og barn hos \u00e9n av dem ved et samlivsbrudd. \u00e9n foreldrene enn Ny Lov om barn og foreldre er under utarbeidelse.

Fra artikkelen Childrens influence.. en Swed ish children's narratives about changing relations post -separation: The data comprise qualitative research interviews with 19 children. At the time of the interview, all participants were between nine and seventeen years old and had between one and fourte en years' expe- rience of sharing their time with both parents. Children were recruited who considered themselves as \"having alternating residence (living every second week or other means of spending half the time with each parent)\". Samv\u00e6rsordning/bostedsordning alla har erfarenhet av att summary, findings illuminate the nuances and the everyday complexities of living in two homes. Routinely managing practical and emotional transitions requires effort, eve n if they become an ordinary part of life to which many children become acclimatised. These transitions may also lead children to reflect about family relationships and think more explic- itly about what they mean to them. Taken together, the thesis demonstr ates that dual residence involves both positive and negative aspects where children's experiences differ and change over time. In the final part of the thesis, key ele- ments that influence children's well -being and the way they feel about practising dual residence are discussed. Children's relationships lie at the centre of dual -residence family life and they play a crucial role in the way dual residence is experi- enced. By focusing children's perspectives, this thesis sheds light on how dual residence can be understood, it highlights the significance of listening to children and considering their views regarding issues that affect their lives.

Three siblings divided the week into two sections and alternate weekends. Temaer Fleksibilitet, tanker om konklusjon The findings reported in this paper show that, from the perspective of children and young people, a shared residence a rrange- ment can work as both a pleasure and a burden. The data are based on a small sample, and therefore I am cautions about drawing general conclusions. However, three points have emerged from the foregoing as significant.

The data analysis used the as guidelines for reflections during the research process. Thematic analysis was guided by van Man en's (1997) herme- neutic phenomenological approach. Populasjon Twelve children aged 10 -13 years, and living in two homes, were interviewed. 130 (antall, kj\u00f8nn, relle/sosio\u00f8konomiske f\u00f8ringer) The study was conducted in five schools in a small, rural island community in the western part of Norway, from January to February 2017. The community has 11,700 inhabitants and 1750 children are divided into levels 1 -10 at ten schools. All of the schools have school health services, and offer divorce support groups (PIS - Program for implementation of divorce groups in school), for children after their parents' separation. The goal is to promote mental health and prevent mental difficulties. PIS is led by one teacher and one nurse, and organized as conversation groups of four to six children, run over a period of six weeks, with a follow -up meeting after six months living in two homes was stressful for children and affected their lifeworld extensively, and for a long time. Children felt torn between their feelings of loyalty toward their parents and their longing for calm and stability in their everyday life. A child centered approach after the parents' divorce is important not only in further research studies, but also for developing and evaluating support focusing on the children's needs after their parents' divorce. Great efforts are needed to include children's voices before establishing living arrangements and social welfare agreeme nts after divorce.

The participating families were recruited through various relevant web- sites concerning divorce and time -sharing arrangements and -share their child, and the child spends a period of time at each household Temaer Forskjeller i The children in this study have certain advantages because of their age (8 -12). They all have cell phones and bikes, and most of them are capable of moving around freely in their neighbourhoods. These assets enable them to connect with their other households in slightly different ways than smaller children. Nevertheless, the children creatively find flexible (sometimes secret) ways to care and be cared for in time -sharing settings. There are various ways of living in childhood, and children have various perspectives on their everyday lives. Children and parents are all contributors to different caring practices, in diverse (fruitful as well as restrictive) ways. In that se nse, 135 care is not to be generalized; it is a specific and situated matter connected to specific and situated circumstances. The question of who actually cares for whom highlights the complex entanglement of perspectives that must be taken into account when investi gating care within Forskningssp\u00f8rsm\u00e5l assessing their conduct of everyday life, this article elucidates what children do to adapt to and make sense of this double -looped situation. This article examines how differences between households affect children's ways of understanding themselves and their family lives. This article examines from an everyday perspective how children attempt to m anage and integrate the differences, de- mands and expectations of the two households, with a strong focus on their experienced possibilities, dilemmas and constraints. Overall research question for this and 2014: What possibilities, constraints and di lemmas emerge through children's (and parents') narratives of everyday life with time -shared living arrangements as a premise, and how does children's participation in two households shape and influence their understanding of themselves and their is a cultural -historical approach to human subjectivity grounded in activity and the structuring of meaning by subjects in and across different social contexts. The interviews were designed as a so -called life- mapping processes and lasted 1 -2.5 h. The children recorded audio diaries , reflecting upon the tra nsition from one household to the other. Populasjon (antall, kj\u00f8nn, alder, foreldre/barn) A total of eight post -divorce families participated in the study, two of which included siblings. There were thus 10 chil- dren aged 8 -12 (three girls and seven bo ys). Furthermore, 14 parents (seven mothers and seven fathers) and two stepparents participated. -sharing arrangements most of the parents who approached me highlighted the fact that a focus on the specific amount of time spent in each household was irrelevant. They argued that they had practised 50/50 time sharing, or planned to do so in the f uture. Therefore, the primary criteria for recruitment were changed to include children who had experienced having two households. want to know about the children's efforts, we need to ask them and to listen. Children's perspectives on their time - shared family lives often disappear in statistic s about risk factors and in the static of well -meaning adults' predeter- mined standards of a healthy childhood. Children have insightful knowledge about the kind of support they need to make the two loops meaningful and coherently connected.

Their ages at the time of divorce varied greatly, ranging from 2 to 18. However, the most common age at the time of divorce was around 13 years. Samv\u00e6rsordning/bostedsordning (ETSA): it refers to parents' own agreed arrangement about children staying half their time with each parent. It is seen as equal although the time split may differ from 7:7 nights to 6:8 and sometimes 14:14, according to the children's ages and wishes or the families' practical circumstances. It needs to be stressed that ETSA is unrelated to the legal custody ar- rangement. It goes further than 'shared parenting', which implies legal joint custody. Its core meaning in practice is equal parental responsibility and the child's equal right to each parent's day to day care and contact. This applies to physical contact on a regular, equal 50/50 time -split. 140 Temaer Relationship with parents; communication and cooperation/conflict between parents; economy; keeping changes to a minimum; geographical distance; respecting or not children's' need for explanation and participation; degree of flexibil- ity; practicalities of two homes; relationship to peers/friends; ins tability; parental conflicts; relationship to grandparents and extended family; different homes with different rules; relationship to parents before divorce; turbulence of two places to stay; parents' new relationships; reasons for choosing the arrangement ; Forfatternes konklusjon The reality of the arrangement in practice is that parents chose the arrangement on the basis of their own preferences rather than a court imposing it or because the generally accepted core conditions for a positive outcome f or children were in place. These negative experiences of ETSA are discussed in further detail and the need for law reform and service improvement is considered.
