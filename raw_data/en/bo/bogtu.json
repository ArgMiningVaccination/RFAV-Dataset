During the past ten years thishospital has developed an excellentreputation for many aspects of its work. In this anniversary year, it is with particular pride that we look back over theachievements of 2002/2003, most notablythe award of three stars by the Commissionfor Health Improvement (CHI). Thisrecognises Chelsea and Westminster Healthcare as a top performing acuteteaching hospital and is a significantachievement. Our thanks go to all our staff who are tireless in the pursuit of the higheststandards of patient care. It was particularly pleasing to be recognised for the work of our clinical teams andmanagers. Teamwork, investment and adesire to deliver the best possible care hashelped us improve our standards year onyear. This focus will be central to ourcommitment to maintain these standards inthe future for people who use the health services provided by Chelsea andWestminster Hospital. Three star status also reflects the tremendous support we enjoy from ourlocal residents, from volunteers, from TheFriends of the hospital, the CharitableFunds Committee, The Children's HospitalTrust Fund, Imperial College School of Medicine, our host Primary Care Trust -Kensington and Chelsea, - the RoyalBorough of Kensington and Chelsea, ourneighbouring NHS hospitals and the NorthWest London Strategic Health Authority. Focusing on patient centred care delivered by multi-disciplinary teams and usinginformation technology we look forward toworking together to maintain the highstandards we have all worked so hard tobuild up in the last ten years. Juggy Pandit, Chairman Heather Lawrence, Chief Executive, Our corporate strategy is built on these principles: Patient safety - care must be safe and evidence-based Patient focus - care must be centred on the patient. Team working - multi-disciplinary team working is essential for better care. Partnership - We must work closely with other organisations. Community - we will contribute positively to the local community Our Philosophy of Care To provide high quality services to local people To provide specialist services supported by world class academic research To be at the leading edge of multi-professional training and education To develop a modern infrastructure that supports patient-centred care2Chelsea and Westminster Annual Report 2002/3The second main task of the PALS team has been to deal with concerns. Amanda said: \"When things go wrong we want to know.The first step should alwaysbe to talk to the person incharge of the ward ordepartment. If that is notsatisfactory for any reason, orif people are not sure who toapproach, then they shouldcome to see us. We will findout what went wrong, andhopefully help to resolveissues on the spot. \"Very often the problems people have with the healthservice are not formalcomplaints, but they areproblems which need to beresolved. \"Some of the concerns over the past year have includedpeople reporting that publictoilets need more handtowels, people upset aboutqueuing for the car park, orpeople who have had a mix-up over an appointment.\" People in hospitals, whether patients or visitors, often hesitate to talk to staff because they feel they are too busy. The PALS team - the Patient Advice andLiaison Service - has been set up to listen and help when people need advice,have concerns or simply don't know where to turn.PALS are here to help Two Patient Advisors handle complaints about our services andfacilities, working alongside the PALS team. A total of 498 complaints were received by the Trust in the last year, of which 88 per cent were respondedto within 20 working days. (Thenational target is 80 per cent). The Trust received 12 requests for an independent review. Three requiredno further action and four have beenreturned to the Trust for local resolution. Of the four returned to the Trust, the Chief Executive and Director ofNursing have offered to meet withthe complainants. Two have acceptedthis offer, and at the time of thisreport, one declined and the Trust was waiting to hear from the other. One complaint is being investigated by the Health Service Commissioner'soffice.One of the best ways for any organisation to improve its services isto learn from complaints. Here aresome positive improvements made in2002/2003: The HIV and GUM Directorate introduced a customer care trainingprogramme for all clinicreceptionists. Outpatient letters for the Cardiology Department have beenamended to include moreinformation for patients about tests. The Bereavement Service established a Death and DignityCommittee to look at issues raisedby relatives and is being expandedto include a child bereavementofficer. The ultrasound reception area has been re-organised to give greaterprivacy to patients. Listening to patients is central to delivering a modern National Health Service. The Chelsea and Westminster has worked over the past ten years to build strong links with its local community. In 1994 the Trust appointed a Patient Advisor to support patients and in September of that year first producedfreepost comment cards to encourage patients and visitors to tell us what they thought about ourservice. Speakers from the Trust visit local community groups - in 2002/2003 some 50 speakingengagements were completed including talks about PALS - the Patient Advice and Liaison Service. PALS Manager Amanda Harrington said that over the past year the teamat Chelsea and Westminster had givenout information to more than 1,100people. Most called at the office onthe ground floor of the hospitalopposite the escalators but there werealso 374 telephone enquiries. Advice given ranged from directing people around the hospital toproviding information about localbuses, to explaining where to buy astamp, or how to register with aGeneral Practitioner. Learning from complaintsAnew information leaflet, We're Here to Help, produced in 2002, explains the role of PALS and invites people to comment on our services. In 2002/2003 we had a total of 377 comment cards returned, of which 157 contained positive comments, 41 made suggestions about how we could change our services and 179 were critical comments. Critical comments help us improve our service. In 2002/2003 comments led to better signage, improved cleaning and higher catering standards.LISTENING TO PEOPLE Good Birth Guide Chelsea and Westminster's maternity services compared well with maternity units across the UK according to Dr Foster's Good Birth Guide published in 2002. The guide showed 35 births per midwife, the recommended number, compared with 50 at some other NHS Trusts. Our Unit also has average rates for the number of elective and emergency caesareans sections.Colette Murphy, who is a member of our Maternity Service Liaison Committee, (MSLC) has given birth to two babies at theChelsea and Westminster. Sadly her first baby, Ethan, was stillborn. Her second baby is now a healthy two-year-oldgirl called Bront\u00eb. Colette said: \"I felt that through my experiences I could help other parents andimprove services.\" Colette and Jane, another bereaved parent, recently gave a talk to health professionals at the Maternity Forum. They both sharedtheir very different experiences so thathealth professionals could have a betterunderstanding of the feelings and needs ofbereaved parents and their anxieties insubsequent pregnancies. Through her work with the MSLC Colette hopes the Trust will establish a designated BereavementRoom and set up training for health professionals. Angela Yates, who teaches ante-natal and post-natal classes at Kensington and Chelsea College, is also on theMaternity Service Liaison Committee. Angela said: \"I come into contact with lots of people who use maternity services at Chelsea and Westminster and Ihear all the praise - and any moans that they have. When I attend the meetings I relay any suggestions back to the Trust. \"I am concerned about the high levels of caesarean births. I think that people need to be educated more about the procedure. It is a major operation. It can take weeks to recover while looking after a newborn child. We would like to see better patient information around this issue.\"Progressive Maternity Services at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital delivered 4,498 babies in 2002/2003. We have a 12 room Labour Ward, including two birthing pools, and a Birthing Unitplus a six bedded private maternity wing. There are two obstetric theatres and one post-natalward. In addition to nine consultants, there are hospital based midwives and seven teams ofcommunity based midwives working throughout West London. Chelsea and Westminster Annual Report 2002/3 3 A Maternity Day Assessment Unit opened in October 2002 to provide animproved service to women who needto be monitored during theirpregnancy. A Birthing Unit opened in February 2003 providing midwifery support for natural birth - that is births without interventions. ConsultantMidwife Susan Oakey was appointed in 2002/ 2003 to head the Unit. LISTENING TO PEOPLE 4Chelsea and Westminster Annual Report 2002/3Day Surgery shows the way Our Charter Mark winning Day Surgery Unit pioneered Pre-Assessment in 1996, producing a series of patient informationleaflets and arranging to do health checks and answer questionsand concerns in advance. The Unit treats between 600 and 700 patients a month in four operating theatres, including our regional specialist Hand Management Unit. About 70 per cent of our operations are done asDay Surgery procedures. Now, in 2003/2004, the DSU is helping develop an exciting new initiative - planning our new Diagnostic and Treatment Centre. In March, 2003 Neil Potter, aged 83, came into Day Surgery for a cataract operation carried out by consultant Mr Neresh Joshi. In a thank you letter to theChief Executive Mr Potter wrote: \"Everyone was cheerful, welcoming and a skilfulcommunicator so I was aware of what was happening which is so important. \"MP Alan Howarth wrote to the ChiefExecutive of the Trustafter he attended thePre-operativeAssessment Unit at theChelsea andWestminster expressing his added: \"What couldhave been somewhatworrying or routinelybureaucratic process was made relaxing and reassuring.Some 90 per cent of our day surgery patients and 45 per cent of elective patients now benefit from Pre-operative Assessment. Clare Evans, who was appointed Nurse Consultant in September2002, explains how the system works:DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY The pre-assessment nurses ensure patients are aware of the procedureand understand what will happenthroughout the admission, operationand during the recovery period. We discuss their health and assess their fitness for surgery andanaesthesia. We also spend time talking things through with patients - giving themclear information and advice andanswering questions. There is much anecdotal evidence and research which demonstrates thatnot only do patients approve of theclinics and find them beneficial butfrom an organisational point of viewcare is streamlined, organised andcancelled operations and inappropriateadmissions are reduced - thus they areeffective for the Trust too. We plan to expand the service to offer appointments to all electiveadmissions - that is to all our patientsbooked to come into hospital and stayovernight for an operation orprocedure.\"\"At present any patient coming into hospital having a general surgery, urology, orthopaedic or gynaecology operation attends a pre-assessment appointment two to four weeks before the date for surgery.Chelsea and Westminster Annual Report 2002/3 5The aim of the Emergency Department is always to see, diagnose, treat and discharge (or admit) patients as quickly as possible. In 2002/2003 our Emergency Department saw more than 80,000 people, including22,000 children seen in a separate department staffed 24 hours a day with trained paediatric doctors andchildren's nurses. In a week in March 2003, a target was set by the Government that 90 per cent of allpatients attending Emergency Departments should be seen, treated, admitted or discharged within fourhours of arrival. Chelsea and Westminster achieved a figure of almost 97 per cent. Lindsay Etherington,Emergency Care Collaborative Programme Manager, explains how this was achieved and how the workcontinues in 2003/2004: Waiting times are reduced if patients are 'streamed' to a majors or minors area with allocated staff. This Trust has five Emergency Nurse Practitioners working in Adult Emergency Care. In 2002/2003 Claire Washbourne was appointed as Nurse Consultant to lead the minor injuries service.Reducing waiting times for Emergency Care \"The Trust spent six months looking at the way it works, following 40 patientsin real time, from arrival in theEmergency Department to discharge:asking for their feelings, theirobservations and comments. We learntthat: patients had to repeat the same story to a large number of people we could avoid many of the queues patients face by making things happenearlier (e.g. having blood samplestaken, deciding to admit a patient) many patients could have been cared for without coming into hospital, orcould have had minor operationsperformed as a day surgery patient ifwe could only change the way wework. Since January 2003, the average waiting time for patients with a minorinjury or illness (e.g. twisted ankle orsimple laceration) has been reducedfrom 2 hours 30 minutes to 1 hour 40minutes. Why? Because we put a senior doctor (consultant or middle grade) at the'I was mightily impressed' In March, 2003 Mr Malcolm Black, an Emergency Department patient, wrote to the Trust Chief Executive expressing his appreciation for \"the friendly, courteous and very efficient way I was treated by everyone; for the extent of the testing - ECG, chest x-ray and blood tests; and for the amazingly short time it took to check me over and send me home. I was mightily impressed and grateful.\"DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY 'front door' to see, treat and discharge patients with very minor problemsrapidly. The Trust joined the third wave of the Emergency Services Collaborative inFebruary 2003, alongside 34 other NHSTrusts in England. The success of the programme relies upon the commitment of clinicians tolead the changes and the views of staff,patients and carers are vital. We all think that the way we work is the only way, butwith some imagination andsupport to try out newmethods we are oftensurprised the difference smallchanges can make.\"6Chelsea and Westminster Annual Report 2002/3 The team, led by Andrea Blay, Consultant Nurse for Critical Care, is a link between our Intensive Care Unitand the ward staff, managers and clinicians. The three highly experienced nurses have a twofold job: firstly, to plan discharges from Intensive Care into thewards; secondly, to help support staff in looking aftermore seriously ill patients on the wards. The team's three main objectives are to:follow up all patients discharged from ICU/HDU recognise deteriorating patients on the wards with the introduction of an early warning system provide education and skills development for ward and medical staff. Intensive Care looks after our most critically ill patients and the level of care we can offer themhas improved with the development of bettertechnology - more sensitive and sophisticatedmachines and close working teams. The medical team of consultant Intensivists, specially trained nurses, therapists, pharmacistsand dietitians all work together in the care ofeach individual patient. The 11 beds on the Unit are used in a flexibleway - they can be Intensive Care, with a ratio of one nurse to one patient or High Dependencywhen the ratio is one nurse to every twopatients. The team cares for about 400 patients a year. The high standards of our Intensive Care Unit were recognised in 1998 when the Unit receiveda Government Charter Mark for excellence. Itwas awarded a second Charter Mark in 2002.Critical Care develops Outreach Team Intensive Care Unit Critical care at the Chelsea and Westminster moved into a new era in the spring of 2003 withthe creation of a Critical Care Outreach Team.

DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY Chelsea and Westminster Annual Report 2002/3 7The 18-year-old was on her way to see Lord of the Rings when she started to feel unwell. The next morning her mother Caroline noticed a small mark onRachel's skin and, after carrying outthe 'glass test', she thought it mightbe meningitis and called 999. If a glass is pressed firmly against a rash and the marks do not fadethen medical help should be called.Caroline's swift action helped to saveher daughter's life. By the time Rachel arrived at the hospital she was unconscious and therash had developed across her wholebody. She had meningococcalsepticaemia. Rachel spent the next three weeks on the ICU battling for her life. Thanks to the expertise of staff on ICU, and Rachel's fighting spirit, shefully recovered and celebratedChristmas three months late.Caroline said: \"The staff were wonderful. I can never thank themenough. The atmosphere on the unitis so open and friendly. \"They encouraged me to talk to Rachel and get involved with hereveryday care. \"It was a terrible time but also very uplifting - the goodness you aresurrounded by is overwhelming.\" On the day of Caroline's 50th birthday, Rachel was able to come offher ventilator. Caroline said: \"It was like giving birthall over again. It was the best birthday present I could have had.\" Rachel, now aged 20, is enjoying life at university and has visited ICUseveral times since her recovery. She said: \"I am so grateful. I came back to show them that I was livingproof of what a difference they canmake. It makes you realise that life isprecious and you have to enjoy it.\" Caroline is a volunteer on the unit and also provides a relative'sperspective on how services on theUnit can be improved. 'The atmosphere on the unit is so open andfriendly' In December, 2001 Rachel Heslop fromFulham was rushed tothe Chelsea andWestminster Hospital's Intensive Care Unitwith meningitis. Rachel is pictured (left) on a visit to the Unit with Caroline (right) and Clinical Nurse lead Jane Marie Hamil.DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLYRobot helps improve service for patients The robot is the first machine in the country to dispense outpatient,inpatient and dischargeprescriptions and both label anddistribute items. When the drugs are delivered to the hospital the pharmacy staff willscan the bar code on the medicinecontainer into the robot and it willstore each package in the machinein a suitable space. When the drugsare loaded or labelled for apatient's prescription this isrecorded automatically by the robot and will help monitor stock andprevent waste. Chief Pharmacist Pippa Roberts said: \"More pharmacists andtechnicians will be available on thewards. \"Pharmacists are now working with consultant teams in medicineand surgery. They have begun totake drug histories on theadmissions ward and attend thepost take ward round. They are currently writing one thirdof discharge prescriptions across the Trust. These changes willsupport the reduction in doctors'hours and speed up discharge fromhospital. \"As pharmacists spend more time on the wards we will also be ableto put in place systems to helppatients self medicate. \"This increases the patient's familiarity with their medicines sothat they take them properly athome and this has been shown toreduce re-admission rates.\" A full shift system also started in December 2002 with pharmacistsworking nights rather than the oldsystem where they were availableon-call only. The Chelsea and Westminster Hospital's Pharmacy Department,employs almost 100 pharmacists,technicians and support staff anddispenses 450,000 prescriptionsevery year at a cost of about \u00a321million. Modernisation of Pharmacy Services - including the installation of a \u00a3500,000 robot in the dispensary department- has been a major development in 2002/2003 at Chelsea andWestminster Hospital. 8Chelsea and Westminster Annual Report 2002/3 DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY Chelsea and Westminster Annual Report 2002/3 9Patientline entertainment offers 16 channels Chelsea and Westminster provides a very specialenvironment for patients, staffand visitors. The hospital is afive storey building builtround a series of atriums with a transparent roof. Within the atrium spaces are major works of art and there are more than1,000 pieces of art in wards anddepartments - thanks to HospitalArts, a charity funded by public andprivate donations which alsoorganises weekly performing art,including music, dance and full lengthoperas on a second floor stage. A two year research project is now proving that the benefits of thishealing environment are not merelyin the mind - it actually helps ourpatients to get better faster. 'Every member of staff enjoyed being in thebuilding...some saidtheir spirits whenthey walked throughthe report, 2003Our Football Jimmy opened the refurbishedDenise KilmarnockEndoscopy Unit in November2002.

DIFFERENTLY10Chelsea and Westminster Annual Report 2002/3Chelsea and Westminster Hospital has six main operating theatres, four day surgery theatres, including a specialist Hand Management theatre; two operating theatres especially for children;two obstetric operating theatres and a Burns Unit theatre. Managing the use of those theatres well is crucial to the service we provide for patients. In2002/2003 there were new initiatives at the Trust. Catherine Andrews, who led the theatresproject, explains what happened: Small changes make a real difference \"We first looked at the reasons why operations were being cancelled. One that stood out was that theatre lists were not starting on time and some operations had to be cancelledat the end of the day because we ran out of time. We have now made some small but crucial changes to our systems and launched the first of several pilotschemes that will make a real difference. For example, in the past the anaesthetist would spend time going from ward to ward to see the first patients ofthe morning. Now patients are sent to the anaesthetistand assessed in the recovery room. This is also better for patients as they can wait for theatre in the recovery room, rather than in a corridor. Theatre Porters have been asked to report sickness a lot earlier so that duty rosters can be reorganised to ensurethings run smoothly.\" 'A lot of people have said these are just simple things to change. Iagree, but it is amazing what adifference these simple things canmake'DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY Chelsea & Westminster Annual Report 2002/3 11Streamlining the patient journey through an operation Chelsea and Westminster Healthcare has appointed twoSpecialist Co-ordinators forEmergency Surgery - DavidMitchell and Linda Myford. Linda, who is the Deputy Clinical Nurse Lead for Day Surgery, isconcentrating on patients treated byPlastic Surgeons and the HandManagement Unit. She said: \"Both our roles are about streamlining the journey for patients- getting emergency cases dealt withas efficiently as possible and helpingpatients by explaining what ishappening, when and why. We are now able to offer an emergency, general anaesthetic daysurgery service to a wider range ofpatients. In the past plastic surgery,and in particular patients with handinjuries, have been given a lowpriority on the emergency operatinglists because their condition is not lifethreatening. The result was some patients had long waits before getting theirsurgery and were cancelled at shortnotice two or three times.\" Tim Aitchison is the first theatre nurse tobe appointed as a FirstAssistant to theSurgeon at the Chelseaand WestminsterHospital. Tim said; \"This an for me toutilise my years ofknowledge andexperience of practicalsurgery to formulate anew extended role fornurses within theoperating rooms. I find the work veryrewarding and enjoy refining my suturing skills. Working closely with consultant surgeonsallows me to learn andbecome more proficientat other surgicalmanoeuvres also. widening theskills base of thetheatre team and soimproving efficiency.\"Pictured from left to right are Linda Myford, David Mitchell and Tim AitchisonDOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY First Assistant to the Surgeon is appointedThis new service helps to reduce the length of stay and reduces the risk ofcancellations. Patients are now given a dedicated appointment for surgery in the DaySurgery Unit, are less likely to becancelled, and can go home on thesame day. David added: 'I work as a liaison between theatres, ward staff andmedical staff. So a lot of the role isabout communicating clearly andmaking sure everyone is kept in thepicture. 'I also see the individual patients and explain the process and support them.' 12Chelsea and Westminster Annual Report 2002/3We are one of the leading NHS Trusts in the country for the development of computer technology and Electronic Patient Records - or EPR as it is known. EPR is the personal health record of every patient - accessible to health professionals at every hospital computer terminal via a security code. Staff use the system to order tests and examinations, to look upthe results of those tests, to track patients through the Emergency Department and send dischargesummaries to GPs. The technology provides e-mail throughout the Trust and access into an internal Trust-wide Intranet which has built an electronic library of medical and nursing guidelines. This means, for example, that anurse or doctor can quickly and easily access up to date information on the best way to care for apatient with a particular condition or having a specific procedure. Pioneering paperlessrecordsData progress wins Top Hospital Award Chelsea and Westminster was a winner at the third 40Top Hospitals programme awards in 2003 presented bythe benchmarking company,CHKS. We won a second award for most improved hospital for theimprovements made in ourquality data. Edward Donald,Acting Director of StrategicService Development, said: 'Staffin the Information Team, and Clinical Directorates haveworked very hard to improve our data and this award belongsto them.' In 2003 a number of NHS Trusts improved their performance inthe 15 indicators selected byCHKS, making the achievementof a 40 Top Hospitals listing thatmuch harder. Indicators includedthe risk adjusted mortalityindex, emergency readmissionrates (within 28 days ofdischarge) and discharge ofstroke patients.The Chief Executive with some of the Trust staff who helped us to achieve the Most Improved Hospital award.

In October, 2002 the Burns Unit at the Chelsea andWestminster Hospital began a pilot of Electronic MedicalNotes using the Trust's EPRSystem 'LastWord' and byMarch 2003 ' paperless'.Dr Barnes, chair of amulti-disciplinary committeeset up to oversee thedevelopment of EPR, said:\"Not all information can beadded to the electronicpatient record such as ECGcharts, but in the longer termit is hoped that all systemswill be integrated. \"One of our big priorities is to help with the launch ofelectronic prescribing which is part of the overallmodernisation of pharmacyhere at the Trust.\"DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY Chelsea & Westminster Annual Report 2002/3 13Imaging Service is State of the Art In the spring of 2003 the actress NataschaMcElhone kindlyconsented to open thenew MRI and CT suite.Pictured left at theopening of the new stateof the art MRI and CTsuite here at the Chelseaand Westminster Hospitalare, from left, SimonPadley.MRI and CT scanners are able to produce images of great accuracy andto do it very quickly - sometimes in thetime someone needs to hold a singlebreath. The experience for patients isfaster and less stressful and the resultsfor consultants trying to diagnoseproblems are much clearer. We also offer a wide range of treatments in the form ofinterventional procedures. For example,Radiology works closely withEndoscopy to treat patients, includingthose with suspected cancers. In 2002/2003 the major development for Imaging was installing no less than15 new pieces of equipment includinga very sophisticated MRI scanner and astate of the art CT scanner. The equipment, which is all being leased - a common practice in acutehospitals throughout the country - isnow installed in the main hospitaldepartment, in our EmergencyDepartment and at the SouthWestminster Centre for Health, in Pimlico, where this Trust provides an x-ray service and an ultrasound unit. Our next big development in Imaging will be in converting to a film-lessdepartment, with all images beingstored and displayed on computers,and being accessible from anyauthorised terminal in the hospital.Imaging Services include Nuclear Medicine which uses a sensitiveradiation detector and computer('Gamma-Camera') to show thedistribution of a trace of radioactivefluid injected into the patient'sbloodstream.Many of our patients refer to the Imaging Services as the X-ray department and the humble plain film x-ray still is the most common procedure - we take about 80,000 a year! But we also do increasingly sophisticated examinations ofsoft tissue - the inside of organs and the inside of the abdomen, chest, skull, joints and spine. DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY14Chelsea and Westminster Annual Report 2002/3Cardiology works closely with the Royal Brompton The time taken for patients who are admitted to hospital suffering heart attacks to receive life-saving thrombolytic drugs has been steadily reduced. By spring 2003 we were thrombolising 80 per cent of patients within 30 minutes of their arrival in the Emergency Department.Patients who have had heart attacks are brought into the Chelsea andWestminster Hospital where they are seen and treated in the EmergencyDepartment. OUR PERFORMANCE We admit patients to our Coronary Care Unit and later send them to theRoyal Brompton Hospital for tests andpossibly for treatment. Our Cardiology Service works closely with the Brompton developing jointposts and joint clinics to improve carefor cardiac patients. New roles have been developed with the recruitment ofnurse specialists suchas a chest pain nurse,heart failure nurse andcardiac rehabilitationnurses. Dedicated vehicle pioneers care for coronary patients The vehicle will also be used for neo-natal transfers and out of hours EmergencyDepartment discharges. This joint venture between the LondonAmbulance Service and the CoronaryHeart Disease partnership programme atChelsea and Westminster is expected tobe picked up by other Trusts around thecountry. Kevin Shire, from the LAS said; \"The crewshave under taken extra training over andabove the normal non-emergency basicambulance personnel training. 'This has involved a three week intensiveblue light driving course and a total of 96hours supervised hours with front lineambulances. They are also trained in some specialistemergency care procedures.\"Chelsea and Westminster is theBrompton's largest referring hospitalsending a total of 155 patients along tothe Brompton in 2002.

RESEARCH AND ACADEMIC DEVELOPMENT28Chelsea and Westminster Annual Report 2002/3FINANCIAL SUMMARY An NHS Trust has the following statutory financial duties laid down by the NHS Executive: to break-even on its income and expenditure account taking one year with another; to keep within the annual Capital Resource Limit; to keep within the External Financing Limit which is the limit placed on net borrowing; and to achieve a 6% return on its relevant net assets (Capital Cost Absorption Duty) The Summary Financial Statements are merely a summary of the information in the full accounts which are available ondemand. I am pleased to report that the Trust has achieved all its statutory financial targets for the year ended 31st March2003. The Trust achieved a surplus of \u00a388,000 during theyear as well as achieving a 6.1% Return on the average netrelevant assets. The Trust met its Capital Resource Limit and undershot its External Financing Limit by \u00a310,000, which iswithin the tolerance allowed.The Better Payment Practice Code requires the Trust to pay all valid invoices by the due date or within 30 days of receiptof goods or a valid invoice, whichever is later. The Trust paid31.3% of its bills by number and 38.75% (in value) againsta specific target of 75% for 2002/03. Other NHS bodies arerequired to pay 90% of the number of invoices received within 30 days. This reflects the cash flow constraints in theearlier part of the year. Budgets for 2003/04 have been funded on the full year effect of outturn and the Trust has agreed a 6.22% genericuplift with its commissioners. The Trust achieved its in-yearbreak-even target with the receipt of additional non-recurrent funding and cost savings of \u00a39.2m. Therefore as part of negotiating new budgets for 2003/04 the Trust hasagreed a recovery plan of \u00a39m with the North West LondonStrategic Health Authority and its key commissioners toreduce its reliance on non-recurrent income.
