Acutonics\u00ae Tuning Fork therapy is a unique system of sound healing - an energy-based, non-invasive approach rooted in Chinese Medicine, with results similar to acupuncture. Precision calibrated tuning forks are applied to specific acupuncture points on the body to access the Meridian and Chakra energy systems. Tuning forks are used to correct imbalances, uncover emotions, stimulate transformation and facilitate inner harmony and wholeness. As well as their healing benefits, they also have powerful rejuvenating effects when applied to the face, similar to micro-current or facial acupuncture. The body is made up of 70% water, and as sound travels 4x faster in water, it makes a perfect resonator for sound. The sound waves of the forks vibrate and travel deeply into the body along energy pathways, affecting human physiology and reaching places not easily accessed. Their rich resonance and vibration connects with and supports the body's natural frequencies, stimulates and balances the body's physical and subtle energy field, and promotes wellness and deep inner harmony. Each Acutonics Tuning Fork is precision-tuned to a natural harmonic series based on the orbital properties of the Earth, Moon, Sun and planets. Each musical combination, or interval, used in the Acutonics Healing System has it's own unique healing properties. Benefits of Tuning Fork Therapy The benefits of tuning fork therapy are similar to those of acupuncture and as the forks are non-invasive, sound therapy is a good option for those who cannot tolerate needles. Beyond this, the resonance itself is deeply therapeutic, relaxing and balancing. The cosmic tones from various forks provide a vibrational link that helps souls, minds, and bodies connect back to their divine harmonies and destinies. Tuning Fork therapy also has similar effects to facial acupuncture when applied to the face. Specific vibrations tone, lift and invigorate the muscles, improving circulation and resulting in an overall rejuvenating effect - as well as restoring internal balance. Among the many benefits, tuning forks help to: Balance the nervous system Reduce stress and tension Promote cellular repair Help Qi to flow freely in the body Enhance relaxation Strengthen and tone muscles Stimulates collagen and elastin production Softens wrinkles and reduces sagging skin What happens during a treatment? During every [Soma Attunement Ritual](/treatments), tuning forks are applied gently at various stages throughout the session to ground one's energy, boost immunity and balance the system. The tuning forks are also used as part of a facial protocol to further rejuvenate the face following facial gua sha. The vibrations of specific forks serve to tone and lift the facial muscles, while the relaxing sound of the vibrations soothes and calms. Results are immediate and last several days.
