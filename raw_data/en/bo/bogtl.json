Gregory K. Fritz, MD President, AACAP continued on page 270 Recently, I was fortunate enough to speak with Bernard P. Dreyer, MD, President, American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). We discussed a myriad of topics, including my Presidential Initiative on Integrated Care, how our organizations can best work together in the future, and a topic close to his heart - child poverty. Because I was inspired by our conversa- tion, I reached out to Dr. Dryer directly to ask if he would be interested in writ-ing for AACAP News. I was impressed with how quickly and resoundingly Dr. Dreyer expressed a positive response to my request. On a personal note, I am grateful for the effort and time Dr. Dreyer took in writing an article for AACAP News . I am excited to share with you the following article from Bernard P. Dreyer, MD, on the AAP's Child Poverty Agenda. m GUEST COLUMN AAP's Child Poverty Agenda As a medical student, I volunteered on the child psychiatric floor of Bellevue Hospital, which cared for the underserved. I had seen statistics on poverty, but I had never really seen poverty and what it could do to a child's physical and mental health. These were great kids, and the more I got to know them, the more I realized that most of these children and teens did not have innate mental health problems, they had social and family problems and were simply reacting to the chaos in their lives. It was my first exposure to the social determinants of health. And it taught me that health is so much more than medical care.Poverty is the most pervasive non-communicable disease children suffer from today. Some 16 million U.S. children live in poverty. That is one in five! And it is not just kids in urban and rural areas who are afflicted. Since the 2008 Great Recession, the largest and fastest increase in poverty has been in the suburbs. The impact this has on child health is enormous. Research shows that chil-dren who are born into poverty - and persistently live in poor conditions - are at great risk for a host of adverse health and developmental outcomes through-out their lives. Child poverty is linked to higher rates of asthma, obesity, infant mortality and greater risk of injuries. What is more, the effects of persistent poverty can lead to toxic stress, which alters a child's genomic function and brain development. This contributes to lower educational attainment and higher rates of teen pregnancy, incarceration and substance abuse - all of which lead to intergenerational poverty, as it is so hard to break the cycle. Because poverty is at the root of so many health and behavioral problems - and can undermine all we do in thehealth care system - the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has made alleviating poverty and its effects on child health a strategic priority. This past spring, the AAP published a report and policy in our Pediatrics journal to help pediatricians care for children in poverty. Our recommendations include screening for poverty risk factors and connecting families who are struggling to resources for housing, food, health insurance and other services they need to get their children on a path to better health. We have also created tools to help pediatricians put these recommenda-tions into practice including sample screening questions, a model for making community referrals and communica - tion materials and guides to help them sensitively broach the subject with fami-lies. (You may access these resources at www.aap.org/poverty .) Using these tools and resources, our members are helping families turn things around and are having a meaningful impact on the health of the children and communities they serve. Benard P. Dreyer, MD, FAAP270 AA CAP NEWSIn addition, the AAP is calling on lawmakers to invest in policies and programs that we know help lift children out of poverty and improve their health. These include: E arly childhood education pro- grams , which have been shown to mitigate toxic stress by providing children with a nurturing, positive environment, cognitive stimula-tion and nutritious meals. Investing in these programs yields returns on investment as high as 14 per-cent per year, while it also lowers rates of remedial education and juvenile crime. N utrition programs like the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) improves birth outcomes, school readiness and cognitive performance. Nearly half of all Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients are children, and children who receive SNAP have better health and educational outcomes than low-income children who do not. A ffordable, high-quality child care increases disposable income and eases stress for parents and has many developmental benefits for chil-dren. The federal government and states provide child care subsidies to low-income families with chil-dren under age 13. But because of limited funding, fewer than 1 in 5 eligible children benefit from child care subsidies. Hig her family incomes are linked with better child health and educa - tion. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Child Tax Credit have reduced family poverty by more than 40 percent and lifted 5 million chil - dren out of poverty. Children whose parents receive these tax credits have been found to have better health and a better chance of finishing high school and going to college. Helping a child reach these milestones puts us one step closer to overcoming the hardships associated with childhood poverty. Because so many poor children have parents with minimum-wage jobs, increasing the minimum wage is also critical. By joining forces and speaking with one voice, we can help make address-ing child poverty a national priority. Realistic, effective solutions are well within our reach. But it will take all of us who care for children to put those solutions in place, so that we can con-quer the disease of poverty and give all children a healthy start. m Benard P.

Child Pove rty Agenda continued from page 269 NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2016 271GUEST COLUMN Integrated Care in Disadvantaged Communities - A Model Program Of the many important reasons to improve the integration of mental health care within primary care pediatrics, reducing dis - parities in care for the most vulnerable children is perhaps the most pressing and poignant. Economically disadvan - taged and minority children suffer from a high burden of chronic disease including mental illness (Price et al, Biomed Res Int. 2013) (Liao et al., MMWR Surveill Summ. 2011). High rates of environ - mental and social stressors including community violence, economic hard - ship, and single parenthood contribute to higher levels of risk for these children. But disadvantaged and minority families utilize subspecialty psychiatric care at lower rates than other families (Coker et al., Acad Ped, 2009)(McAlpine and Mechanic, Health Serv. Res. 2000) (Flores and Tomany-Korman, Pediatrics, 2009), for a variety of reasons includ - ing economic and cultural. Lack of timely access to care for these children increases their risk for morbidities that already disproportionately affect under - served communities and which bear a significant cost to society and individu - als, including school failure, teenage childbearing, unstable employment, marital instability, violence, psychi - atric and physical comorbidities, and substance use disorders (Mental Illness Exacts Heavy Toll, Beginning in Youth: NIMH; June 6 2005, Wang et al., 2004). In disadvantaged communities, embed - ded child psychiatry fee-for-service consultation could be particularly useful for overcoming certain barriers to care. On-site consultation could reduce certain logistical and financial barriers including locating a specialist, obtain - ing and paying for transportation, and missing extra time from work associated with extra travel. This model could also help to overcome resistance to care associated with stigma against mental illness by locating the psychiatrist in a familiar and more trustworthy environ - ment. It could not only improve patients' access but also reduce no-show rates for psychiatrists evaluating publicly insured patients. Increasing the direct contact between psychiatrists and pediatricians could also improve pediatricians' knowl - edge and comfort level with psychiatric problems. Finally, such an arrangement presents a greater opportunity for effec - tive co-management of mental health conditions by psychiatrists and primary care clinicians. At MGH Chelsea HealthCare Center, we have piloted an embedded consultation model. \"MGH Chelsea\" is a community-based health center associated with Massachusetts General Hospital located in the city of Chelsea, Massachusetts. Most of the city's residents are Latino and speak Spanish at home, and many suffer from severe poverty and low educational attainment (Census Viewer 2014). The Adolescent and Pediatric Practice at MGH Chelsea is the largest pediatric practice in Chelsea and the largest affiliated with MGH for Children, where 13 pediatricians conduct about 12,000 well child visits each year in a Family-Centered Medical Home model. The practice uses the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC) to screen school-age children for behavioral health symptoms. MGH Chelsea also has a Behavioral Health Unit staffed with psychologists, social workers, and psychiatrists, some of whom see children. Children referred to Behavioral Health establish care with a therapist prior to accessing an evalua - tion with a child psychiatrist. In 2013, MGH Chelsea developed a new program that allows pediatricians to refer patients directly for a consultation on diagnosis and treatment recommenda - tions with a bilingual child psychiatrist available within their department. The goal of this program was to reduce barri - ers associated with accessing psychiatric evaluation including long wait times, high drop-out rates, stigma, and poor provider communication. Referred patients are scheduled to see the consulting psychiatrist for an initial eval - uation, followed by a plan for short-term (3-6 month) stabilization if needed. All patients are seen within the Pediatrics Unit. The long term goal is transition of care back to primary care pediatrician, and more infrequently co-management between the psychiatry consultant and primary care provider. A pilot study examining preliminary feasibility of this model is underway, and preliminary data has started to teach us some important lessons that could be applied to future embedded psychiatry models. Over 200 patients were referred during the first year and a half of our program. Although \"no shows\" are a common problem in this urban clinic serving mostly publicly insured patients, most referred patients came in for an evalua - tion. Patients were actually more likely to show for a psychiatric evaluation in the embedded model compared to usual care. Pediatricians referred with questions about diagnosis, medication manage - ment, and recommendations for follow up care. The most common reason for referral was ADHD, followed by mood symptoms, anxiety symptoms, behavior problems, and developmental concerns. Many patients had multiple diagnoses as well as a previous history of mental health treatment. Our preliminary analysis suggests that younger patients and those with higher total and externalizing symptom scores on their last PSC were more likely Andrea E. Spencer, MD continued on page 272272 AACAP NEWSIntegrated Care in Disadvantaged Communities continued from page 271COLUMNS to show for an initial appointment. Furthermore, the higher the PSC score, the more visits a patient was likely to have, suggesting that more impaired patients were seen more times. The number of visits per patient varied con - siderably, but most patients were seen for 3 or less visits. This model is a departure from usual care for psychiatrists and other mental health professionals, pediatricians, and patients. Adapting to increased access to child psychiatry and understanding a pri - mary care consultation model involves a \"learning curve\" for the whole system. While in our experience, pediatricians (and pediatric subspecialists) adapt fairly quickly to the idea of consultation and short term care because they appreciate any access to child psychiatry, they may need coaching on the appropriateness of referrals and on the need for closer follow up in primary care for patients \"transitioned back.\" This education can be provided in real time by the child psychiatrist. Pediatric support staff (e.g. nurses, medical assistants, and front desk staff), who may take phone calls from patients between visits, will also need education on the model. Support staff benefit from clear documentation of a care plan as well as protocols for refer - rals and prescription refills, especially for controlled medication that may be pre - scribed at one time by psychiatrist and at another by the primary care provider. Community providers and school staff accustomed to old models of care often will initially assume that a patient is establishing a long term treatment relationship. Some families may enter the evaluation with this in mind as well. Thus, the consultation psychiatrist must set clear expectations about the model of care, and the system must have a mechanism for community referrals for families who need more support. On the other hand, in our experience, having an embedded child psychiatrist in the office that is well-connected with patients' primary care physicians can provide a significant source of comfort for both families and providers. Knowing that the same specialist is available for questions or an additional appointment if needed can ease the transition back to primary care. The opportunity for \"co-management\" with primary care can also provide an option for more complicated patients. Finally, child psychiatrists are also often not trained in this type of outpatient primary care consultation-liaison (CL) model. Clearly explaining and docu - menting one's role, planning for the transition back to primary care, main - taining availability for new patients, and developing principles and protocols for co-management are key components to the model's success that differ from older outpatient practice designs. Furthermore, the role requires a different skill set and treatment framework compared to inpatient CL, in which child psychiatrists field a different distribution of referral questions and treatment goals (Carter et al, J Pediatr Psychol, 2003). Despite the adjustment, this role can be extremely rewarding, particularly for a psychiatrist working in an underserved community. The reduction in \"no shows,\" opportu - nity for team-based care and continuing education with pediatrics colleagues, and range of clinical questions and dis - ease severity could increase satisfaction for both psychiatrist and pediatrician. Alongside such promise, certainly many more questions remain to be answered, and as these models become more com - mon it is imperative to share knowledge of both the bumps and the benefits along the way. m References Carter BD, Kronenberger WG, Baker J, Grimes LM, Crabtree VM, Smith C, McGraw K.

I hope you had an enjoyable and productive trip to the Annual Meeting in New York. For those of you who did not attend the meeting, this issue will provide you with some highlights from the meeting. It has been my privilege and honor to serve as the News' editor. Time has flown by! I am very grateful to the edito - rial team and the membership for all the accomplishments in the past four years. I would like to take this opportunity to update you on recent additions/changes. We strive for diversity in author - ship as well as content. Authors have included academicians and private practitioners, clinicians and researchers, and all stages along the career path from residents and early career psychiatrists to seasoned veterans in the field to retirees. This could not have been accomplished without significant contributions from individual authors, coordinators, and section editors. We continue making strides to publish on a wider diversity of topics important to our members and encouraging more mem - bers from varied backgrounds to submit articles. Consistent with the Presidential Initiative on integrated care of Gregory K. Fritz, MD , AACAP President, we have published sev - eral interesting topics in this area. We initiated a new section, Psychopharmacology Corner. Gabrielle Carlson, MD , the Section Editor, and her recruits have made diligent efforts to distil the research in this critical field to provide prac - tical information to clinicians. We initiated a new column, Systems of Care, and Mark Chenven, MD , is the coordinator for this column. While the Clinical Case Vignettes have been popular over many decades, they have been primarily limited to psychodynamic themes. We have expanded this column to include a variety of interesting case reports, including complex diagnostic issues, pathophysiology and a range of treatments. Jeffrey Hunt, MD , is the new coordinator for this column. In order to provide opportuni - ties to the wider membership to serve on the editorial team, we make changes to the editorial team at regular intervals. Neera Ghaziuddin, MD , has joined the team in January 2016 to serve as the editor for the Columns Section. She has replaced Jean Dunham, MD. Harmony Raylen Abejuela, MD, who was the resident editor until last year has transitioned from the Media Section to Opinions Section. Erik Loraas, MD , is the new Resident Editor. Christopher Varley, MD, who served as the Opinions Section editor departed from the team last summer. Dale Peebles, MD , is the new Youth Culture column coordinator. As a final note, I would like to empha - size that the AACAP News belongs to you. I seek your input to help shape it. Please share any new ideas you have with me, as well as criticisms, by contacting the management team (Rob Grant, the Managing Editor, or me), or any of the section editors or coordina - tors. Also, I welcome your individual contributions as authors. If you are doing work you think might of interest to other members, please submit it. While we cannot promise that every submission will be published or that every criticism will be translated into an actionable item, we are commit - ted to working with you to accomplish these goals. I can be reached at urao@utk.edu . Rob Grant can be reached at rgrant@aacap.org . Contact information for the other editorial board members and coordinators is provided in the masthead of the AACAP News . In addition to the hard copy, members can read the AACAP News online at the follow - ing CASE REPORTS AND VIGNETTES A Note From the Column Coordinator I am pleased to introduce an expan - sion of the AACAP News Clinical Vignettes Column to include clinical case reports that will come from the entire range of practice in child and adolescent psychiatry. AACAP News has for decades focused on psychotherapy cases and vignettes, and these submis - sions will continue to be represented. This expanded column recognizes that our field has evolved into a myriad of fascinating areas of clinical work, and the column will highlight this diversity. One needs just to read the registration magazine of the AACAP 2016 Annual Meeting to see the great breadth and depth of our field. This column will hopefully see representative cases submitted from child and adolescent psychiatrists in all of these areas. The column also addresses the fact that it is increasingly difficult to find ven - ues to publish case reports. Most high impact journals either do not accept case reports or have limited them to brief letters to the editor. Although case reports are considered in the lower tier of the evidence-based hierarchy, they clearly have a role in depicting clinical work in a naturalistic setting with greater description of the context, which is often missing in randomized controlled treatment trials that have excluded many patients with comorbid conditions. I am currently program director of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Fellowship and Triple Board Program at Brown University and the Director of Inpatient and Intensive Services at Bradley Hospital in Rhode Island. I am also part of a research team at Brown University focusing on longitudinal follow-up of bipolar disorder and the treatment of adolescent mood disorders. I have been frequently struck by the diversity and complexity of cases that we all struggle to manage. Nearly every clinician and trainee that I have had con - tact with has had unique and interesting patients that could be the focus for a case report. This column is open to all AACAP mem - bers, including clinicians in academic and non-academic settings, as well as all child and adolescent psychiatry trainees. Members should submit case reports of 600-1200 words with five or less references to me for review prior to pub - lication. There will be up to three case reports published each year. The cases should be well described and should have an educational value for members to consider. The cases could highlight an aspect of clinical practice that needs to be modified or be in an area where further research is needed. Examples of possible themes include: Unusual side effects or adverse interactions involving medications Unusual presentations of a com - mon disorder Descriptions of a rare disorder Unexpected outcomes in treatment Notable challenges in working with families, schools and other systems Cultural issues in treatment Cases involving interface with pediatrics Early positive findings related to emerging treatments The content should generally fol - low usual standards for case reports. Recently, a consensus concerning the optimal structure of clinical case reports was published that can be useful in helping members craft their submissions (Gagnier et al. 2013).The case reports for this column should include: Title Introduction of clinical issue or issues being presented in the case Patient description with clinical findings, timeline of disorder and diagnostic assessment Therapeutic interventions, follow-up and outcomes Discussion and recommendations for further exploration Members should be sure to de-identify the patient material and obtain informed consent when needed. If the case report contains one or more of the 18 Personal Health Information (PHI) data elements, then written patient authorization would be required by HIPAA regulations. Additionally, institutions will vary regard - ing the need for IRB approval when two or more cases are reviewed. Authors should discuss with their local IRB prior to submitting for publication. Case reports should be sent to me at Jeffrey_hunt@brown.edu . I will provide edits and suggestions as needed. We are hopeful that many Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Triple Board, Integrated, and Post Pediatric Portal training programs will take advantage of this column, as successful publication will easily satisfy some of the ACGME scholarly activity requirements. m Reference Gagnier JJ, Kienle G, Altman DG, Moher D, Sox H, Riley D (2013).

Jeffrey Hunt, MDCOLUMNS NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2016 275DIVERSITY AND CULTURE Ethical and Legal Issues in Child Psychiatry: Consent, Privacy and Refusal of Treatment Unlike adults who can make decisions about what treat - ment they want - or don't want - children face a myriad of complex issues that factor into their ability to control their medical care. This primarily stems from children's inability to make informed decision. Their brains are not fully developed; their life experiences are incomplete; and their ability to understand long-term consequences is limited. However, that does not mean that adults should be the sole decision- makers when it comes to minors' treat - ment. In fact, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly encourage adults \u2014 be they clinicians or guardians \u2014 to involve the minor in decisions related to his or her care. The question that arises then becomes just how much autonomy a minor should have when it comes to treat - ment. Given the vastly different rate at which minors develop emotionally and intellectually, age cannot be the sole determinant. Research shows that some 14-year-olds have the ability to under - stand their diagnosis and voice sound opinions related to their treatment, while others may still be years away. Until minors turn 18, parents generally have the decision-making capacity over treatment, though that's not always the case. In emergency situations, or when dealing with a \"mature minor\" or eman - cipated minor, adolescents do not need parental consent to receive treatment (Maradiegue 2003).State laws provide some clarity, though they vary from state to state. Most states empower parents to consent on their children's behalf for medical treatment. A 2015 study that reviewed the various state laws related to mental health and substance abuse consent issues found that laws required parental consent more often when the minor was receiving mental health treatment (Kerwin et al. 2015). More than half the states required such consent in inpatient settings, but only 39-46% required parental consent in an outpatient setting. When it came to substance abuse treatment, minors were able to access treatment without parental consent more often than not - and frequently at a younger age than for mental health. States also typically grant exceptions from parental consent for contraception, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV treatment and pregnancy-related care. The issue of consent becomes even trickier when the minor or guardian refuses treatment. In those cases, it is helpful to keep in mind these four prin - ciples from the AACAP's Code of Ethics (AACAP 2014): 1. Beneficence: Promoting the wel - fare of children and adolescents. 2. Nonmaleficence: Minimizing harmful effects. 3. Autonomy: Grant respect for the choices and wishes of the individual patient. 4. Justice: Advocacy and Equity. While each principle stands on its own, applying all of them to one case may be problematic, as they may compete with each other. It is important for clini - cians to remember the larger picture and end goal when considering each case individually. When parents refuse the recommended treatment, the clinician has to step in to seek the best possible care for the minor. Sometimes these refusals stem from religious objections. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that parents can cite religious beliefs when it comes to their children's treatment, but that right is not absolute (Black 2006). The caveat remains that those beliefs cannot put the minor at grave risk. Childhood vaccination has been in the news lately, as some parents are practicing their legal right to refuse vaccines for their children, despite a significant health hazard to the children and the commu - nity at large. After a measles outbreak that started at Disneyland in California and spread to affect 150 people, the governor there signed a law last year that banned religious waivers as exemptions for vaccinations (Brown 2015). In a case in Oklahoma, parents cited religious beliefs when they stopped medical treatment for their severely ill daughter, but the court overruled and determined that the child was in danger of suffer - ing further brain damage or even dying without treatment. When it is the minor who refuses treat - ment that could save his or her life, the issue becomes more complicated. The clinician needs to determine if the refusal is based on the minor's religious beliefs or the beliefs of his or her guard - ians. Equally important is determining how beneficial the treatment will be. Underlying these factors is the minor's competency to understand the potential outcome of refusing care. In addition to religious considerations, clinicians should be cognizant of racial, ethnic, and culture considerations of minority patients. Some cultures may not readily recognize mental health diagnoses, while others may initially cast off treatment because of the stigma sur - rounding mental illness. Minors and their parents alike may need an interpreter or a cultural consultant to help explain the extent of the illness and treatment options before either will consent. When resolving either the parents' or minor's Balkozar Adam, MD continued on page 276COLUMNS276 AACAP NEWSdecision to refuse care, clinicians who have exhausted respectful and coopera - tive means may have to seek assistance from child protection officials, the state or the court. Muddying the waters even more are the issues of privacy and confidential - ity. While all patients are entitled to privacy, not all are guaranteed confi - dentiality. In cases where a minor may present a threat to self or others, the clinician is obligated to alert guardians or authorities. In more common situations, guardians may demand information the minor disclosed to the clinician with the understanding that it will remain confidential. Keep in mind that some minors may not seek needed treatment if they believe their confidentiality will be compromised. That is why it is critical that the clinician explain at the get got the extent of confidentiality to both the minor and the guardian. Creating a clear confidentiality policy will help to avoid piecemeal decisions and inconsistencies. In addition, because not all states adhere to the same laws when it comes to con - fidentiality of minor patients, clinicians must remain up to date on their state laws (Bruce et al. 2008). m References American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2014).

Psychotherapy Award Sergio V. Delgado, MD , professor at the University of Cincinnati School of Medicine, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, won the 2016 AACAP Norbert and Charlotte Rieger Psychodynamic Psychotherapy Award for his paper \"Two-Person Relational Psychotherapy: High School Age Adolescents.\" The paper is a chapter in Contemporary Psychodynamic Psychotherapy for Children and Adolescents: Integrating Intersubjectivity and Neuroscience , written by Dr. Delgado in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Cincinnati: Jeffrey Strawn, MD , and Ernest Pedapati, MD . In this paper, Dr. Delgado demonstrates through the case of Michelle, a 16-year-old, how traditional \"one-person\" psychodynamic theories and techniques (drive theory, ego psychology, object relations and self-psychology) compare with contemporary intersubjective theory and techniques. Over the past thirty years a confluence of thought in relational psychoanalysis and research in developmental psychoanalysis, such as the work of Emde and Stern, has led to a heightened awareness that the therapeu - tic action in psychoanalysis and psycho - therapies is not solely, or even primarily, reliant on delving into the intra psy- chic, subjective reality of the patient (one-person focus) but arises from the interpsychic matrix of the patient's and therapist's experience of one another (intersubjective focus). Michelle has difficulty coping with sad feelings stemming from the breakup of a two-year, long-distance relationship with a 17-year-old girl whom she had never met in person. Since the breakup, Michelle had spent much of her time in her room crying and requested that her mother \"find someone I can talk to....it is not right to feel this bad.\" Previously a good student, after the breakup she had begun to struggle at school. Dr. Delgado provides Michelle's history of birth to a teenage mother who relinquished her to her grandparents at age three and then took her back at age thirteen when the mother's life had settled down. Michelle's father had ceased his intermittent contacts when she was ten. Although Dr. Delgado and Michelle agree that abandonment is one of her issues, his intersubjective approach does not dwell on discussing the past or expecting Michelle to understand her past. A detailed description of the work that transpired is provided revealing the way in which the intersubjective experience in the here and now of the sessions guided the psychotherapist's interven - tions during the process. The reader is given a running commentary of the therapist's thoughts and feelings. He explains how he used this intersubjec - tive awareness to guide his technique, noting that \"much of what transpires that promotes changes and moves along the process occurs at an implicit nonverbal level and is strongly influenced by the patient's and psychotherapist's tone of voice, posture, and nonverbal expres - sions in the here-and-now moments.\" Those who wonder what is actually said and done during a therapy session will find this case illuminating. What may be of particular interest to the novice therapist is Dr. Delgado's description of how he discusses with the adolescent her mother's phone conversation with him before the session. Equally compel - ling is his description of recognizing that, at a point when he had become tired and uncomfortable, he disengaged and changed the subject creating a disruption of the patient's flow of feelings and con - cerns. He describes different theoretical approaches to this disruption but most importantly gives the reader a model of his use of a self-reflective approach to repair the breach. The inspiration for Dr. Delgado's paper and book came from his residents who responded to his supervision and teaching of psychodynamic theory and technique, particularly the intersubjec - tive approach, by repeatedly urging, \"Please write a book.\" Dr. Delgado is eager to have early career child and adolescent psychiatrists understand that psychodynamic theory and practice have not stood still since Sigmund and Anna Freud did their work. After medical training in Monterrey, Mexico, Dr. Delgado, encouraged by his mentor, Dr. Cesar Garza-Guerrero, went to the Menninger Clinic in 1981 for his psychiatric and child and adolescent psychiatry training. He studied adult and child psychoanalysis in the intellectually rich and eclectic Topeka Psychoanalytic Institute (TIP) where he became both a supervising and training analyst. He says of TIP, \"an eclectic institute permitted Rachel Ritvo, MD continued on page 278 Sergio Delgado, MDCOLUMNS278 AACAP NEWSme to have a balanced and in-depth understanding of the of the pluralistic traditional one-person models and the two-person relational models, which is not the case at all institutes.\" While at Menninger, he had the opportunity to meet Sir John Bowlby, Dr. Daniel Stern , and Dr. Robert Emde. Dr. Emde invited him to co-author a case report, a project that he says, \"solidified my thirst to learn two-person, relational psychol - ogy in depth and began my questioning of the 'truths' of the traditional one- person model.\" Dr. Delgado took up an appointment at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital in 2002. Today, he is director of outpatient services in the psychiatry department there. Having joined the Cincinnati Psychoanalytic Institute, he strives to introduce the two-person perspective on psycho - analytic work there. In particular he has launched a Relational Advanced Psychotherapy Program. Dr. Delgado feels strongly that faculty and leaders in child psychotherapy prac - tice need to encourage early career child and adolescent psychiatrists to write about therapy. He hopes Rieger winners, past and future, will make themselves available as mentors. He understands the fear and doubt early career psychiatrists may feel about clinical writing. He himself faced \"thinking in Spanish and writing in Spanglish,\" which for many years discouraged him from writing. This prize-winning paper demonstrates his mastery of writing in English. The difficulties he had learning to write in a second language inspired Dr. Delgado, while at Menninger, to work with a learning disability specialist in order to delve more deeply into cogni - tive and learning issues of his patients and to write about these issues. He is now sought out by educational special - ists \"to help parents understand that oppositional behaviors are likely due to difficulties in cognition and learning.\" Dr. Delgado's paper was chosen from a field of six submissions in this fifteenth year of the Rieger Psychodynamic Psychotherapy Prize.

I am the only child and adolescent psychiatrist in Malawi, a southeast African nation of 16.8 million people. There is only one other psychiatrist in the country, the director of Mental Health at the College of Medicine (COM) where I am teaching for a year. There is a lot of physical and sexual trauma, AIDS orphans, post-cere - bral malaria brain damage, and extreme poverty here, as well as all the regular mental health issues. It feels overwhelm - ing as I write it, but being here is so novel and interesting that I can only think about the Big Picture when I am brainstorming research ideas or system changes with others in the department of mental health. I arrived in Lilongwe, the capital, on July 23, 2016, after spending a fascinating 10 days at Peace Corps headquarters in Washington. My group there worked hard, absorbing lectures all day about tropical diseases, safety, HIV/AIDS, and other topical issues. Once in Lilongwe, we had two additional weeks of orienta - tion to the country, with daily Chichewa (language) lessons, skits on cultural sensitivity, and many practical matters. Then our counterparts, those in-country with whom we would be most closely aligned, met us and we all drove in buses to our sites. I am in Blantyre, the commercial center of the country, as is my partner, Linda Oris Robinson, who is a nurse midwife. Linda was here 35 years ago as a Peace Corps volunteer and has worked as well in Congo (DRC) and Samoa. Her book, Sunday Morning Shamwana: A Midwife's Letters from the Field , is a great read about the day-to-day reality of a fieldworker in the African bush! We are volunteers with the Global Health Service Partnership (GHSP), a joint effort between Peace Corps Response, Seed Global Health, and PEPFAR (The President's Emergency Program for AIDS Relief). There has been a crippling migration, understandably, of medical doctors from developing coun - tries to the United States, the United Kingdom, and other first world coun - tries. After people go through medical school at home, they go for residency to wealthier countries, and many do not return to their native country. GHSP is sending health care professionals to bolster their training so they may wish to remain at home, raising the level of health care available locally. This is the fourth year of the program and 51 physi - cians and nurses are currently dispersed at teaching sites in Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda, Liberia, and Swaziland. We are 19 in Malawi. My role is primarily teaching the fourth year medical students. I give lectures, participate in problem-based learning exercises, and supervise the students in the mental health clinic. The students are super: smart, hard-working, fun, funny, and helpful. I do not think I was like that at Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons; probably complaining more! I am also starting a weekly consultation to an orphanage for street children. In addi - tion to being cared for, they learn the fundamentals to prepare them to attend the neighborhood schools, and the teens get vocational training such as bicycle repair, carpentry, brick laying, and other skills. I am applying for a small Peace Corp grant to set up another vocational program to teach making briquettes for cooking from a slurry of leaves, corn husks, rice hulls, grass, dried manure, +/- cardboard by putting them through a press and letting them dry. Deforestation has been a terrible problem here and people spend a lot of energy gathering wood for cooking in distant places while all the above ingredients are right at hand and free. The scope of practice of a child and adolescent psychiatrist can be as broad as you wish! Although the psychiatric drug formu - lary for the country is small-fluoxetine, chlorpromazine, haloperidol (including depot), risperidone-we manage to treat the most severely ill. The families have to buy Artane or Cogentin, if needed. I have treated mostly adults for schizo - phrenia, bipolar mania and depression, unipolar depression, dementia (HIV vs. alcohol-related), eating disorders, self-cutting, and so forth. I have seen a child who had cerebral malaria as an infant and as a result has serious developmen - tal delays, and an 11-year-old boy with childhood schizophrenia. Yesterday, I saw an 18-year-old who was driving drunk in April with a friend and they crashed. The friend died. My patient was belted-in and survived but with multiple fractures, was in a coma for a month, and was hemiplegic upon awakening. Four months later he is walking, talking in English and Chichewa, and improv - ing every day. We are setting up a Child Psychiatry Clinic within the ambula - tory Pediatric Clinic, which will be an improvement for the kids. There are quite a few United Kingdom physicians here and there is a Scottish trust that supplies two psychiatrists for weeks or George Stewart, MD continued on page 280 Malawi \"After people go through medical school at home, they go for residency to wealthier countries, and many do not return to their native country.\" COLUMNS280 AACAP NEWS Lake Malawimonths at a time to teach in the College of Medicine. The two I have met were well-informed and delightful. Malawi has many beautiful areas, includ - ing Mt. Mulanje, one of the highest peaks in southern Africa. We took a guide and a porter and went up there for three days over a weekend. Lake Malawi is one-third the area of the country. It is the third largest lake in Africa and has the largest number of species (>600) of fish of any fresh-water lake in the world. There are game reserves, high plateaus, pottery and wood carving vil - lages\u2014so much to enjoy! The markets, where bargaining is the order of the day, are fabulous. In the United States, purchasing something is a straightfor - ward, rather sterile transaction. Here, it is a social interaction; the sellers smile happily when you arrive at a price that you both like. It is said that the way to ruin a Malawian's day is to pay the full price; the seller will then wonder all day that they could have charged more. Bargaining is addictive! GHSP provides us with a house\u2014we have a spacious three-bedroom, three- bathroom home with a large, fenced front and back yard at the end of a dead-end road. We are starting a vegetable garden and there are avocado and guava trees, two frangipani trees and an incred - ible weeping willow/bottle brush tree currently in bloom in front of the house. We are on a hill and look up at an amaz - ing mountain, Mt. Sochi, from our front porch. There are servants' quarters in the rear, but no one lives there. We are provided a guard and a gardener for free and have a housekeeper/laundress three times a week for $20 a month. It feels colonial but it provides people with jobs for which they are grateful. We also are given mountain bikes and helmets by the Peace Corps, which allow us to get around, if we are not on foot. I brought home a case of Carlsberg for a party on the back of my bike, pushing it awk - wardly for over a mile. A slender woman passed me, gracefully carrying about 75 pounds of chickpeas in a container on her head. Made me feel feeble! This week was the Silver Jubilee (year 25) of the College of Medicine with celebrations that included dancing, drumming, speeches, and research pre - sentations every day; and a banquet and fireworks completed the occasion. I would encourage any AACAP member, young or old (I just turned 76) who wants an adventure and a change of perspec - tive to contact Peace Corps GHSP. It is a remarkably well thought out and well supported operation. Our training is fab - ulous, the students are wonderful, and the very large canvas is quite blank. mA Child Psychiatrist in Malawi continued from page 279 Mt.

NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2016 281 COMMITTEESMEDIA COMMITTEE Tracking Applications and Monitoring Online - Good Parenting or a Violation of Trust? Everywhere you look, children and teens are online. Whether at home, social events, at family functions, or restaurants, and often even at school, young people typically seem preoccupied with cell phones, tablets, or computers. Parents are often nearby physically, but typically have little involvement or even knowledge of their children's online behaviors and activities. A 2015 survey indicates that children average over 4.5 hours per day on-screen media for entertainment, and teens average 6.5 hours per day (Block 2014). Nearly half of that screen time is consumed on a mobile device. It is becoming more common for even elementary-school aged children to own a smartphone with relatively unre - stricted, unlimited, and unmonitored Internet access. In psychiatric practice, we often see the negative effects unrestricted computer activities have on children and ado - lescents. Although Internet Gaming Disorder is currently a condition requir - ing further study in the DSM , research confirms that excessive or addictive video gaming or Internet habits are frequently associated with new-onset or worsening insomnia, depression, anxiety, and academics (Gentile et al. 2011, 2014). Inappropriate Internet use, whether it involves online bullying, sex - ting, pornography, dating or 'hook up' sites using location services, excessively violent video gaming, or online involve - ment with peer groups that support drug use, cutting, or eating disordered behaviors, frequently causes or exacerbates mental health prob - lems in our patients. As child and adolescent psy - chiatrists, it is our duty to guide our patients and their families towards safe and healthy habits, including computer habits. However, there are few com - monly accepted guidelines for doing so. The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended that parents make a media plan including education, supervision, and restric - tion of total screen time to one or two hours per day, allowing no screens in a child's bedroom. Before a child gets access to the Internet, especially via a new computer, tablet, or smartphone, it is vital for parents to teach children guidelines for going online. The best way to do this is by example: parents must moderate their own online habit, ensuring it does not interfere with their responsibilities and relationships. Discussions should include teaching digital citizenship and establish - ing how and when the device is to be used (including mealtime curfew and a ban on devices in the bedroom at night), what websites the child is allowed to visit, what videos the child is allowed to watch, what the child can and cannot disclose to strangers, and how to post in a respectful and safe manner and what to do in response when others do not. Issues of cyberbullying and sexting must be discussed in a developmentally appropriate manner. It is imperative for parents to understand that they have not only the right, but also the responsibility to supervise their child's online activities. The develop - ing brain is more susceptible to harmful influences, such as addictive behavior, so protecting children from unhealthy online experiences is vital. A prospective study demonstrates the powerful protec - tive effects of parental media supervision on a child's behavior, sleep, body mass index, and school performance (Rideout et al. 2015). Media supervision is particularly important for children and younger teens who have recently gained access to new online freedoms (such as acquiring a new smartphone) or whose online behavior has seriously violated rules or caused significant consequences. However, there is little agreement regarding how parents should supervise children's media use, and reliance on traditional direct supervision can be particularly challenging. Children can easily thwart direct supervision by deleting instant messages or browser histories, and closing pages or applica - tions at a parent's approach. Supervision becomes exponentially more difficult when a child owns a smartphone and uses it outside of the home. Parents can set up restrictions on smartphones, tab - lets, and computers regarding how they will function. For his thirteenth birthday, I gave my son his first smartphone, but he can use it primarily to text, listen to music, and access a limited number of educational applications without access to a web browser, games, and the ability to download applications. Tracking applications are relatively novel tools that allow parents (typi - cally with a fee-based subscription) greater access to information about their child's online activities and even their physical location. These applications Paul Weigle, MD continued on page 282 282 AACAP NEWS COMMITTEEScan also be useful for teens who have problematic involvement with drugs, sexting, or cyber-bullying, have made suicidal threats, or have been negatively influenced by online communities or peers. Children and teens typically do not appreciate any type of supervision, and often complain that the use of these tracking applications is essentially spying and constitute a lack of trust and viola - tion of privacy. The difference between supervising children and spying on them is whether or not the children are aware that their activities are being monitored. Therefore, parents should inform their children beforehand that they will be checking on the child's online activ - ity. Checking on their activity without informing children beforehand can more accurately be seen as a violation of trust and risks damaging the relation - ship. When a child protests regarding feeling untrusted, a parent can truthfully respond that they are not yet satisfied that the child is ready to behave appro - priately in all situations, but the child has the opportunity to prove herself/himself/ over time. At times, teens have expressed relief that their parents are monitoring their devices, as it becomes a convenient way to save face to peers while allowing a teen to resist unwanted peer pressure to sext, glorify drugs, or engage in other unhealthy behaviors. Naturally, supervision can become excessive. Parents must supervise when it is important to ensure healthy habits, not simply to satisfy their own curios - ity. A teen ultimately needs to learn to handle issues on his or her own and accept the consequences. Ultimately, the best way to make children and teens safe is to teach them to take care of themselves. In addition, having a healthy amount of privacy in relationships is important for social development in adolescence. Therefore, as a child or teen demonstrates good digital citizen - ship and adherence to house rules and restrictions, supervision should be gradu - ally lifted over a course of years. These can be reinstated in case of a significant violation or when new online freedoms are granted.Parenting children and adolescents who are raised in an Internet-saturated world is in many ways more complicated but, as child and adolescent psychiatrists, we can help parents use the tools at their disposal to protect their children from unhealthy habits and dangerous expo - sures, while teaching them self-control and granting them sufficient freedom needed to become healthy adults. m References Block M, Stern DB, Raman K, Lee S, Carey J, Humphreys AA, et al.

NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2016 283 COMMITTEEScontinued on page 284TELEPSYCHIATRY COMMITTEE Keys to a Successful Telemental Health Practice Introduction AM, a six-year-old male, goes with his mom to his school-based health clinic for an appointment with a telepsychia - trist. AM's mother and his teachers have been concerned about his behavior and academic progress. Since there was not a psychiatrist in their community, AM's parents choose to have him evaluated via videoconferencing. When they arrive at the clinic, the psychiatrist dials into the clinic, is introduced to AM and his mom, and then begins his appointment. Similar to a face-to-face encounter, the psychiatrist obtains a detailed history while observing the child. With the psy - chiatrist's observations, a comprehensive history, and teacher/ parent reports, a detailed understanding of the child evolves. The telepsychiatrist discusses his findings with AM's mom and they review treatment options. Prior to the existence of telemental healthcare (TMH), AM's treatment would have been constrained by distance and a dearth of providers. Limited resources, long travel times, high travel expenses, unreliable transportation and provider shortages previously rendered this family unable to find care. TMH has changed the lives of people like AM. Establishing a successful, patient-oriented TMH practice requires careful consideration of several aspects. Some features are intuitive because they are no different from face-to-face appointments, but oth - ers are unique to telepsychiatry. Based on seven years of personal experience as a telepsychiatrist and a review of the literature, I have compiled a list of some key considerations when developing a TMH practice. Space Room size, d\u00e9cor, and design are criti - cal when developing TMH clinics. The space must be suitable for the clinician to observe parent and child interac - tions. The patient must be able to stand, sit, wave, walk, and move during the appointment. The room needs to have enough space for at least one adult to sit next to the child and be visible on camera. A room that is too large, or filled with extraneous equipment, may be distracting or over stimulating to the child (AACAP 2008, ATA 2009b). Bandwidth Teleclinicians rely on observation of patients' movements, affect, and com - munication for diagnostic evaluation and treatment decision-making. In order to accurately replicate face-to-face evalu - ations, there must be high bandwidth (384 Kbits/sec) and monitor resolution (> 30 frames/second) (AACAP American Telemedicine Association [ATA] 2009b, ATA 2013). Adequate bandwidth facilitates detection of affec - tive state and withdrawal, mild tremors, tics, fine motor control, and neuroleptic- induced abnormal movements. Sufficient bandwidth minimizes the time lapse in verbal transmission, allowing the patient and teleclinician to freely converse and any anomalies of speech and prosody become evident. Insufficient bandwidth produces pixilation of the video signal and delay of the audio signal so that the teleclinician and patient interrupt one another, impeding the mental status examination (Glueck 2013). Camera Cameras have a crucial role during tele - health appointments. The task demand and bandwidth influence camera choice. Careful camera placement enables providers to easily observe participants and activity in the exam room. If a pro - vider can remotely control the tilt, pan, and zoom (TPZ) functions to view the patient, the provider's power of observa - tion is heightened (AACAP 2008, ATA 2009b, ATA 2013). Having TPZ controls to view the provider's side enables fami - lies to take a virtual tour of the provider's office and feel more connected to the provider (AACAP 2008, ATA 2009b, ATA 2013). With TPZ ability, the provider may use the camera to play \"hide and seek\" with children (Glueck 2013). Placing the camera directly in front of the patient at eye level maximizes eye contact. Putting the monitor either higher or lower on the wall guides the patient and provider to have more natural eye contact. Currently many telehealth set-ups have the camera above, below, or to the side of the moni - tor. This placement produces a gaze that appears to have a person looking down, up, or sideways, respectively (AACAP 2008, ATA 2009b, ATA 2013). Since teleclinicians must look at the patient, the camera and the medical record during visits, the provider's gaze is often diverted, leading the patient to think that the provider is not paying attention. An ideal system enables the provider to maintain eye contact with the patient at all times. Several solutions exist to solve this problem. By focusing the camera above mid chest some notes may be taken without an interruption in eye gaze, if the provider is able to write or type without looking. Unfortunately zooming in on the provider distorts the patient's perception of the clinician. An alternative set up uses two moni - tors placed close together to minimize changes in eye or head position. Figure 1 shows a novel set up with the monitors placed vertically and a camera in the middle. There is less head movement as the teleclinician looks up and down and his/her gaze passes the camera. Toys/Artwork Children can draw pictures and share with the provider. These pictures may shed insight into the child's thoughts and feelings. This author worked with a Felissa Goldstein, MD284 AACAP NEWS COMMITTEESKeys to a Successful Telemental Health Practice continued from page 283 site that let children use a nonfunction - ing keyboard so they could type \"just like the doctor.\" Children like to bring a favorite toy and show it to the teleclini - cian. Some toys should be at the patient site so the provider can observe the child playing and occupy the child while adults talk. Noisy toys will interfere with auditory communication and toys with many parts will provide a cleanup burden for staff. Sound Quality Successful TMH sessions are predi - cated on quality sound production and transmission. Dropped signals, dyssyn - chrony with the video signal, and echo interference all hinder the provider/patient relationship. Microphones should not transmit ambient noise but be able to detect quiet voices. Placing carpeting on the floor, draperies on the windows, and sound panels or textiles on the walls improves sound quality and softens hard surfaces. A sound machine outside the room decreases interference from out - side noise and increases auditory privacy (AACAP 2008, ATA 2009b, ATA 2013).Picture in Picture A unique feature of videoconferencing is the \"picture in picture\" (PIP) func - tion. A small box in the corner of the monitor shows the teleclinician how he/ she appears to patients and vice versa. Teleclinicians may use the PIP function to see how they and their background appear, and to note their affective responses to the patient (AACAP 2008, ATA 2009b, ATA 2013). Children and adolescents enjoy seeing themselves on camera. m Conclusion Telemental healthcare is a promising service delivery model to provide mental health care to children and adolescents who do not have access to usual models of mental healthcare. Conducting an accurate evaluation, providing evidence-based care, and achieving effective outcomes all via telehealth requires consideration of the technology, space, and system design. To ensure success, stakeholders must champion TMH by educating families, community mem - bers, and providers about its value.References American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2008).

NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2016 285 COMMITTEESCoalition building is key to any successful grassroots advocacy campaign. Simply stated, allied organizations are more effective when working together towards a common goal. Joining with other stakeholders allows for an exchange of ideas and sharing of resources. This can lead to a more distinct and persuasive message, a demonstration of consensus, and ultimately a greater impact on shaping health care policy. In an effort to support coalition building at the local and state level, AACAP continues to offer Advocacy and Collaboration Grants to our regional organizations. The Advocacy and Collaboration Grant Program is offered through the American Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry with the sup - port of the Department of Government Affairs and the Assembly Executive Committee. Grants in the amount of $3000 are awarded annually to regional organizations. To qualify, regional organization's advocacy must be designed to improve children's mental health care, and collaboration between regional organizations and allied orga - nizations is required. In 2016, AACAP awarded seven grants to the following regional organizations: Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, and New York. Congratulations to all partici - pants for developing innovative and meaningful programs. \"The AACAP Advocacy Grant allowed the psychiatric community in Omaha to partner with community advocacy organizations, the academic community \"The AACAP Advocacy Grant allowed the psychiatric community in Omaha to partner with community advocacy organizations, the academic community and students across many health disciplines and began a dialogue on the need for everyone to be engaged in reducing violence.

Now is the time to start planning for 2017. Regional organizations are encouraged to apply for the upcoming AACAP Advocacy and Collaboration Grants. Deadline for applications is January 13, 2017. Advocacy programs must be designed to improve children's mental health care and be devel - oped with other allied organizations. Activities must be completed within the calendar year in which the grant was awarded. While it is possible to develop programs that will inform mental health policy, grants cannot be used for lob - bying. Inquiries can be directed to the Government Affairs team at gov@aacap.org . mAACAP Advocacy and Collaboration Grants We look for pictures\u2014paintings included\u2014that tell a story about children, family, school, or childhood situation.

Anthony Outstanding Woman Leader Award: Gabrielle A. Carlson, MD I am very grateful to Gregory Fritz, MD , and AACAP for the 2016 AACAP Virginia Q. Anthony Outstanding Woman Leader Award. Being acknowl - edged by my profession for leadership in general makes me very proud. Attaching it to being a woman is even more special. I chose to go to an all women's college (Wellesley) precisely because I wanted to be educated in a place where female leadership was prized. Girls with a brain in public high school were not cool in my day. Spending four years with all women classmates was not nearly as much of a challenge as going from being \"top dog\" in high school to scrabbling for \"lucky to be average\" in college. Besides, I figured there would be plenty of men around in medical school to which I had long intended to go. Indeed, at Cornell, I was one of five women in a class of 86 students. I chose Cornell for a reason that has guided many important decisions. All other things being equal, I like places where the leaders are basically nice people. The person who interviewed me, Dr. Tom Meikle (who ultimately became the medical school's dean), was very nice and made Cornell feel appealing. As it turned out, he took good care of me and made sure my male lab partners were a decent group of guys. That was a good thing, for although most of my male classmates were respectful, a few were obnoxious. So, lesson #1 - if leader - ship is kind and respectful, it sets an important tone. Being a minority had its pluses. I have been life-long friends with my first roommate, and I married one of my lab partners, who became my second room - mate. As many of you know, Harold has been the wind beneath my wings for my whole married life. So lesson #2 is, if you are going to have a partner, make sure it is someone with whom you can enjoy your successes and who will sup - port you in failures. I was the only woman in over 50 house staff at Jewish Hospital (part of Barnes-Jewish) in St. Louis. As a testimony to how oblivious I was, I did not realize that fact until I took a good look at the house staff pictures many years later. I was oblivious due to lesson #3. I have always worked closely with nurses. They have been great colleagues and have saved my behind more often than I care to admit, so I never felt alone. The team is important. Fast forward to training at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). I was the first woman clinical associate at the Clinical Center, in Bethesda. This was novel enough at the time that the clinical director was flustered about how I would take night call as I would be \"sleeping in the same bed as the male clinical associates\" (albeit not at the same time). I was indignant that I would be viewed differently from the guys. If I had had my wits about me, I would have offered not to take night call. It has always been important, though, not to have people cut me slack because of gender. My time at NIMH was the first time that being the \"only woman\" registered with me. Four things saved the day. Though female nurses and the social worker, like the clinical director, did not know quite what to make of me because the public health service doctors had always been men, these non-physician col - leagues were experienced observers and clinicians who made my experience fun and educational, and got me through many a rough spot. I also met a patient, a young man with severely psychotic mania who basically changed my life by sparking a clinical research ques - tion about the nature of mania versus schizophrenia in youth. This inspired me to go into child and adolescent psychia - try to learn more about developmental psychopathology. Dr. Fred Goodwin, my unit director, on his way to becoming a major force in mood disorders research, did two things for me. He challenged the difference of opinion we had about the aforementioned patient by making me do the research to test my hypothesis. When I proved I was right (which clearly surprised him), he was man enough to admit it and supported me rather than squelching me. Not all leaders do that with their prot\u00e9g\u00e9. So lesson #4 - work for people who give you a hand up the ladder of success, not someone who stomps on your hand until you give up and let go. The final day saver was Judy Rapoport, MD . She does not know it, but having a scientist and woman child and adolescent psychiatrist in a lead - ership position provided me with an important role model. Mind you, role models do not have to take you on their knees. It is simply comforting and liber - ating knowing that certain possibilities are available. Doing child and adolescent psychiatry training at UCLA was also a \"person\" decision. My training at Washington University in St. Louis and NIMH made me an appealing fellowship candidate to Dr. Denny Cantwell, a well-known St. Louisianan and clinical researcher. I was at crossroads deciding where to go next for training. Harold had narrowed the choices down to four places based on offers he had received. Denny took the time and trouble to telephone me and make me feel wanted and valued. That was so important! For those of you who knew Denny, no other explanation is needed. He was really smart, a great clinician and thinker, and a real char - acter. When he told a joke, it was like \"Click and Clack, the Tappet Brothers\" Gabrielle A.

NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2016 287FEATURES from NPR's Car Talk . You never knew if you were laughing at Denny's joke or laughing at him laughing at it. Denny had many wise expressions. To paraphrase his \"choose your parents wisely\" aphorism, lesson #5 is \"choose your training director wisely.\" Choose a place that values the quality of the train - ing director, and cares about the trainees and the future of our profession, not just how many relative value units (RVUs) the trainees can generate. That is a battle we can't afford to lose. That brings us to the present and the importance of AACAP to my life. Having a really astute (astute = smart + savvy) person like Ginger Anthony at the executive director's helm for 39 years is undoubtedly responsible for the success of the organization. Her legacy/award that celebrates women's leadership is empowering and brilliant. I am proud to be among a growing crowd that includes Magda Campbell, MD , Marilyn Benoit, MD , and Mina Dulcan, MD . It has been my pleasure to chair some of our most successful training opportuni - ties, like the Psychopharm Insitute and Review Course. Being AAAP Annual Meeting program chair was one of the most fun and rewarding things I have done. I never thought I would volunteer for a committee (I usually hate commit - tees), but Council, first under Paramjit T. Joshi, MD 's, and then Gregory K. Fritz, MD's, leadership is also proving to be a great opportunity to make a differ - ence. But that also brings me back to the \"wind beneath my wings\" metaphor with which I began this piece. Heidi Fordi, the current executive director, and Jill Brafford, Director of Meetings, and her meetings team have been people to whom I owe a great deal of my AACAP success and, like other women col - leagues, they get my eternal gratitude. m Dr. Carlson is professor of Psychiatry and Pediatrics at Stony Brook University School of Medicine in Stony Brook, New York.

Help for Children Who Hear Voices Seetha Subbiah World Scientific Education 2016 Paperback: 160 pages - $18.50 Did you Hear That? Help for Children Who Hear Voices is an illustrated thera - peutic storybook about hallucinations in children. Organized into six short chapters, the book follows five children and their unique experiences with visual and auditory hallucinations. Their stories help to normalize the experience of hallucinations and dispel a number of myths a child may have about therapy. Chapter 1 tells the story of Susie, a nine-year-old girl who sees and hears the voice of a pirate when she struggles with decisions or fears making mistakes. Susie finds relief as she works with her therapist to understand the origin of the hallucinations, including the strong connection with early abuse by her biological father. The next story is about Carlos, a 6-year- old boy, whose auditory and visual hallucinations of a fire-blowing dragon and a witch began after his parents' divorce. His hallucinations improve as he works through his feelings of guilt and anger with a therapist. Selma is a 15-year-old girl who sees and hears three girls. She initially found these entities entertaining, but soon the argu - ments among them became distracting. Her hallucinations began after she was placed in foster care and was separated from her sister.Chang, a 12-year- old boy, also began to hear a voice highly critical of him not long after he was placed in his grandparents' care after his mother's struggle with schizophre - nia left her unable to care for him. The support of his grandparents and guidance of a counselor helped him. The last story is about a four-year-old toddler Leila, who sees and hears her recently deceased mother. The book describes her hallucinatory experiences as comforting and as a way for her to remain connected to her mother. The final chapter brings the stories together and reviews basic principles of managing hallucinations in children. Management is limited to individual therapy and largely focuses on help - ing co-create a narrative with the child about the significance and origins of the hallucinations. Additionally, each child develops his/her own \"trick\" to utilize when bothered by hallucinations. Throughout the book, Susie, the young girl in the first chapter, offers brief nar - rations and insights. Her questions are dispersed throughout the chapters and emphasize important concepts and facilitate further discussion. Emotions are highlighted with bold and colorful text. Bright and colorful illustrations bring the stories to life even more vividly. Did You Hear That? Help for Children Who Hear Voices is an ambitious storybook that attempts to tackle the challenge of dealing with and managing hallucinations in children. It is a valuable resource for families and helps normal - ize the experience of hallucinations and its appropriate management. The book tells the stories of children whose ages range from 4 to 15; and given its illustra - tions, it is particularly suitable for young children. The management section discusses the value of family support and efficacy of individual therapy, but not medications. [ Question to the author - do you think discussing hallucinations in teenagers, and hallucinations in chil - dren with schizophrenia with parents, the therapist should at least mention medication? ] m Media Page Erik Loraas, MD Resident Editor NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2016 289 FEATURESAACAP members who would like to have their work featured on the Media Page may send a copy and/or a synopsis to the Resident Editor, Erik Loraas, MD, 3811 O'Hara Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 , or by e-mail to loraasek@upmc.edu .DSM-5 Casebook and Treatment Guide for Child Mental Health Edited by Cathryn A. Galanter, MD, and Peter S. Jensen, MD American Psychiatric Association Publishing 2017 Paperback: 452 pages - $79.00 DSM-5 Casebook and Treatment Guide for Child Mental Health is a new offer - ing from APA Publishing well-suited for clinicians and students. Organized by cases, the book presents key principles of evidence-based assessment and treat - ment in child and adolescent mental health. Written by experienced clinicians (e.g., psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, pediatricians, and nurses), each case is realistic and highlights common challenges faced by everyday providers. All cases are accompanied by expert commentaries, considering psychotherapeutic and psychopharma - cological perspectives of assessment and management. The book begins by describing the general organization of the casebook and how the editors and contributors approach and conceptualize cases. Each case is presented in a systematic fashion, reviewing identifying informa - tion, chief complaint, and history of present illness, including past psychiat - ric, medical, developmental, social, and family histories. Mental status exams as well as helpful reviews and discussions of relevant rating scales and structured assessment measures are also included. Each case offers a psychotherapeutic and a psychopharmacological perspec - tive by leading experts in the area. These discussions include a review of diagnostic formulations, including DSM-5 diagnoses, suggested diagnostic assessment tools, and treatment rec - ommendations. Each case ends with numerous references. Part I presents 12 classic cases, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, separa - tion anxiety, selective mutism, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, chronic marijuana use, psychosis, anorexia nervosa, Tourette's syndrome, disordered sleep, and obsessive compulsive disorder. Part II focuses on 7 cases with comor - bid complexity, including disruptive behavior in an adolescent, threats to harm a teacher, misuse of prescription medications, multiple anxiety disorders, rage attacks, language and reading dif - ficulties, and irritable bowel syndrome. Part III presents 5 cases, such as oppo - sitional behavior in a young child, a dysregulated preschool child, clinical high risk of developing psychosis, non- suicidal injury, and psychotic symptoms in a child who is a victim of neglect. Part IV highlights 5 cases of children in crisis including depressed mood in a child in foster care, irritability and anger in a refugee, depression in the context of divorce, childhood bereavement, and disinhibited attachment in a toddler. Part V concludes with chapters focused on diagnostic decision-making and the future of treatment decision- making based on research and expert clinical perspective. DSM-5 Casebook and Treatment Guide for Child Mental Health is a great resource for clinicians and students of child and adolescent mental health. With 29 cases of varying difficulty, even the most experienced practitioner will find this book valuable. The case-based format is well-done and the consistent organization of each chapter allows for easy navigation and quick reference. The comprehensive discussion of psycho - therapeutic and psychopharmacological principles provides a unique opportu - nity to learn how leaders in the field approach realistic clinical scenarios. m 290 AACAP NEWS FEATURESDance.

Poetry Photo Credit: Alvin Rosenfeld, MD292 AACAP NEWS OPINIONSOn the Value of Our Medical Training Many years ago, I was killing time in the Emergency Department at a large metro - politan county hospital, waiting for the next psychiatric patient to be brought in. I was then a second year resident, rotating through the very active and acute county emergency service as part of my university's general psychiatric training program. Wanting to deal both with my boredom and to be supportive, I made an effort to engage a new intern on the medical service in conversation. He appeared to be anxious. He was concerned about a patient of his, and his supervising resident was nowhere to be seen. I said hello to him and wondered out loud that while it might be hard for him to believe, as I was simply a psychi - atrist-in-training, if he were aware that I could interpret dreams\u2014yes, even the dream that his patient was then having. And I could do this despite the fact that I had never known or dealt directly with his young adult male patient who was lying unconscious on a gurney 20 feet away. It was hard for the intern to believe that I had such powers, so I became deter - mined to prove it to him. Though almost entirely unresponsive to external stimuli, his patient appeared to be restless, rock - ing slightly from side to side. I told him the young patient dreamt he was in the second grade in school and desperately felt the need to urinate. As he needed to be excused from class so that he could go to the restroom, he was doing all he could to attract his teacher's atten - tion. Although the teacher kept looking around the classroom, she persistently failed to see him. The intern expressed disbelief! I there - fore told him to go back to his patient, and when he got there, instructed him to palpate his bladder. I predicted that he would find it very likely extended up to the umbilicus. Perhaps, partly to humor me, he did. Astonished, he came back a few of minutes later asking how could I have known that the bladder was full, seemingly to the bursting point. How could I know and understand the dream of an unconscious patient, especially one to whom I had never spoken or even gotten physically close to? I decided it best not to answer any of those questions. What I did instead was suggest that he catheterize his patient and then very slowly decompress the bladder, and the next time he decides to administer IV fluids to an unconscious patient, he might also think about insert - ing a catheter. I never saw that intern again. But half a century later, I continue to be impressed over and over again with what we as psychiatric physicians can discern and how helpful we can be due to our unique experiences. I appreciate that our abilities are complexly determined. Certainly, some come out of our formal training, which gives us knowledge of such things as the importance of a biopsychosocial formulation, psychol - ogy, physiology, pharmacology, child development, diversity issues, trauma studies, and the like. Additionally, some undoubtedly come from a self-selection process that, consciously or not, leads us to choose to be physicians and then psy - chiatrists. Still others come from specific experiences we have in medical school. Physicians are unique. Few others are given permission to put their hands into every bodily orifice, or to take a blade to cut open a living person in order for us to see and feel the different cavities that house our patients' various organs, to deliver a baby, or to sit with a person who is in the process of dying. I strongly believe these experiences sensitize us to the vast range of issues our patients bring when they come to us for relief from their psychic suffering. In addition to this sensitization, these experiences also serve to help us have the strength to deal with our patients simultaneously with sympathy, empathy, and objectivity. m Dr. Levin is a Distinguished Life Fellow.

After the author(s) has revised the statement, they may resubmit to the PSAG; OR The author(s) is informed that the statement does not meet the criteria for a policy statement. \u00bbIf the PSAG recommends it, the Executive Committee reviews the statement to decide whether it should be e-mailed to Council or placed on Council's meeting agenda. If the Executive Committee decides not to advance the statement, the author(s) may be contacted to resolve the issue(s). \u00bbIf emailed, Council members have a two-week discussion period in which to convey concerns and ask questions. After this period, a one-week voting period begins. \u00bbIf Council approves the statement, the author(s) is notified. The statement is printed in AACAP News and distributed to the recommended sources then placed on the AACAP website. \u00bbIf Council does not approve the statement, the author(s) may be requested to rewrite and resubmit to the PSAG with an explanation of what changed. \u00bbEvery two years, the PSAG reviews all policy statements for necessary revisions or updates. Revisions are made by the original author(s), if available, or by known specialists in that area of expertise. The revising author(s) is given a 3-month period to make changes and resubmit to the PSAG for final approval. \u00bbAnnually, committee chairs are asked to review policy statements online and update if necessary. AACAP Policy Statement Requirements Policies should: 1) be a statement regarding an important policy issue, 2) be a well-written statement, as brief as possible, 3) identify the target audience, 4) have the potential of having some specific impact, and 5) include ideas for distribution. Platitudinous statements supporting \"Apple Pie and Motherhood\" or condemning the multitude of actions, behaviors, social events, or cultural patterns which may have some negative effect on children and families are not likely to serve the AACAP well and may, ultimately, undermine the credibility of AACAP efforts in other areas. The final draft policy statement should be submitted by the author(s) or body (e.g., component or Assembly) to the Policy Statement Advisory Committee via the National Office . In formulating the policy statement, the authors should keep in mind the criteria as stated above. Statement must include ideas for distribution. If the author(s) wishes to have the statement reviewed by the next Executive Committee or Council, they must have the draft statement to the National Office eight weeks in advance.e f *revised 10/2012310 AACAP NEWS FOR YOUR INFORMATIONILLINOIS FACULTY CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRISTS Chicago, IL The Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and the Ann and Robert H.
