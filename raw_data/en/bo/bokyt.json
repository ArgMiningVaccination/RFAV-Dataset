The Health Products Act (HPA) provides for the legislative basis for regulating the manufacture, import, supply, presentation and advertisement of therapeutic products, one of the health products categories regulated under the Act. 1.1 Scope of This Guidance Document This guidance document describes the procedures and requirements for submitting an application to register a therapeutic product, or to make a variation application to a registered therapeutic product. Under the First Schedule of the HPA, a therapeutic product means any substance that: (a) is intended for use by and in humans for a therapeutic, preventive, palliative or diagnostic purpose, including any of the following purposes: (i) for preventing, diagnosing, monitoring, treating, curing or alleviating any disease, disorder, ailment, injury, handicap or abnormal physical or mental state, or any symptom thereof; (ii) for investigating, modifying, or replacing any physiological process; (iii) for influencing, controlling or preventing conception; or (iv) for inducing anaesthesia. (b) has as its constituent any of the following active ingredients: (i) any chemical or botanical element, naturally occurring chemical or botanical material or chemical product obtained by chemical change or synthesis; (ii) any metabolite from a micro-organism; GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 12 of 170 (iii) any macromolecule extracted from an organism; or (iv) any substance derived from a biological system, including any of the following: (A) a whole cell or micro-organism, such as a whole virus or bacterium used as a vaccine; (B) a part of a micro-organism, such as a sub-unit vaccine; (C) a plasma-derived product; or (D) a biotechnology-derived substance, such as a protein or polypeptide; (c) exerts an inherent effect either pharmacologically, chemically or by other physiological means, leading to its use for a therapeutic preventive, palliative or diagnostic purpose; and (d) is not any of the following: (i) a medical device; (ii) any product containing human or animal cell or tissue; (iii) any substance administered to humans with a view to regulating, repairing, replacing, adding or deleting a genetic sequence; (iv) whole blood or any blood component; (v) any Chinese proprietary medicine; (vi) any homoeopathic medicine; (vii) any medicated oil or balm; (viii) any quasi-medicinal product; or (ix) any traditional medicine. To avoid doubt, items d(v), (vi), (vii), (viii) and (ix) have the same meaning as defined in the Medicines Act 1975 in paragraph 2 of the Medicines (Traditional Medicines, Homoeopathic Medicines & Other Substances) (Exemption) Order. In making an application for a therapeutic product, applicants should ensure that the submission requirements as specified in this guidance document are duly fulfilled. In a situation where an applicant proposes an alternative to any of the specified requirements, such a proposal should be accompanied by scientific justification and discussed with HSA prior to making the submission to avoid potential rejection of the application. Information on pre-submission consultation can be found in Chapter B; 5.4. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 13 of 170 HSA may also request for additional information to supplement the specified submission requirements if this is deemed necessary for the assessment of the safety, efficacy and quality of the product for which an application is made. Information on the submission requirements can be found in the following Chapters of this guidance. Within this document, the term ' quality ' is used to describe chemical, pharmaceutical and biological data, while the term ' non-clinical ' is used to describe preclinical, pharmacological and toxicological data. Applicants are advised to check HSA's website for the latest version of this guidance document and other related therapeutic product registration guidelines. 1.2 Therapeutic Product Registration A therapeutic product registered under the HPA is specific to the product with respect to its: proprietary or brand name; pharmaceutical formulation; pharmaceutical dosage form (i.e. physical presentation) and strength; and indication(s) and dosing regimen. Different formulations, dosage forms and strengths of the same chemical or biologic entity are considered as different products and will require separate registrations for the individual product. Forensic Classification Upon satisfying the regulatory requirements for quality, safety and efficacy, a therapeutic product may be registered under one of the following forensic classifications, which determines the level of control for access: Prescription-Only Medicine (POM); Pharmacy-Only Medicine (P); or General Sale List medicine (GSL). Prescription-Only Medicines (POM) control is required in the following situations: GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 14 of 170 (a) The product poses a direct1 or indirect2 danger to human health, even when used correctly, if used without medical supervision; (b) The product is frequently and widely used incorrectly and, as a result, is likely to present a direct or indirect danger to human health; (c) The product requires further investigation into its activity and/or side effects; and/or (d) The product is normally prescribed by a doctor or dentist to be administered parenterally. The following also needs to be taken into consideration when deciding whether a product should be classified as a POM: (a) Whether the product contains a substance which is listed in either the Narcotic Drug Convention or the Psychotropic Substances Convention; (b) Whether the product is likely to lead to medicinal abuse or addiction if used incorrectly or to be used for illegal purposes; (c) Whether the product contains a substance which, by reason of its novelty or properties, has the potential to fall within point (b) above; (d) Whether the product, by reason of its pharmaceutical characteristics, is reserved for treatments which can only be administered in a hospital; (e) Whether the product is used in the treatment of conditions which must be diagnosed in a hospital or in an institution with special diagnostic facilities; and/or (f) Whether the product is intended for outpatients but may produce serious side effects, which would require medical supervision throughout the treatment. Pharmacy-Only Medicines (P) control is required for products that possess characteristics which are not sufficiently critical to warrant POM control but for which the following apply: (a) Consultation with a pharmacist is necessary to confirm the appropriate choice of therapy; (b) The contraindications, drug interactions, precautions or warnings need reinforcement by a pharmacist or are not easily recognised by the purchaser; or (c) Special precaution is needed in the storage and handling of the product. 1 Direct danger: Adverse reactions for which there is no preventive action or which are serious, severe or of high frequency 2 Indirect danger: Masking of an underlying condition that requires medical attention e.g. cancer, heart disease GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 15 of 170 General Sale List Medicines (GSL) control is sufficient in the following situations: (a) The product is reasonably safe and can be sold or supplied without the need for supervision by a registered doctor, dentist or pharmacist; (b) The contraindications, drug interactions, precautions and warnings are easily recognised by the consumer; and (c) The hazard to health, the risk of misuse, the risk of misdiagnosis, or the need to take special precaution in the storage and handling the product is small. 2 APPLICANT RESPONSIBILITIES The applicant of a product registration refers to the local company that is submitting a therapeutic product application in Singapore. The applicant company may authorise officers, permanent employees, or designated external parties, all of whom are referred to as the \"applicant representative\", to submit the therapeutic product application . According to Section 30(10) of the HPA, an applicant, in making an application for the registration of a therapeutic product, must ensure that all information contained in the application is truthful and is not misleading. An applicant must inform HSA of any emerging information that may affect the benefit-versus-risk assessment of the therapeutic product to which the application relates, as soon as the applicant becomes aware of such information. The applicant is responsible for submitting the application and all the accompanying supporting documents (including but not limited to the dossier, responses to HSA's queries and commitment letters). HSA may require a statutory declaration by the applicant verifying any information contain in or relating to the application. 3 WHETHER A THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT IS SUBJECT TO PATENT An applicant for registration of a therapeutic product is required to make a declaration on whether the therapeutic product for which registration is sought is subject to a GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 16 of 170 subsisting patent, pursuant to Regulation 23 of the Health Products (Therapeutic Products) Regulations, hereafter referred to as the Regulations . The declaration must be made in the form specified in Appendix 1 - Form 1 of this guidance document and furnished at the time of making the application, as well as at any other such time as HSA may require. A second declaration is required prior to the grant of registration. A registration application may be declared as one of the following categories: Category A1: where no patent is in force in respect of the therapeutic product to which the application relates; Category A2: where a patent is in force in respect of the therapeutic product to which the application relates and the applicant is either the proprietor of the patent, or if the applicant is not the proprietor of the patent, the proprietor has consented to or acquiesced in the grant of the registration; Category A3: where a patent is in force in respect of the therapeutic product to which the application relates, the applicant is not the proprietor of the patent and the proprietor has not consented to or acquiesced in the grant of the registration, and the applicant is requesting for the grant of registration after the patent expires. A Category A3 declaration is applicable only to an application that is made within 18 months of the patent expiry from the point of application submission. Such an application may not be made earlier than 18 months before the patent expires. Applicants who deviate from this guideline may be required to withdraw their application and resubmit it at the appropriate juncture; Category B: where a patent is in force in respect of the therapeutic product to which the application relates, the applicant is not the proprietor of the patent and the proprietor has not consented to or acquiesced in the grant of the registration, and in the applicant's opinion and to the best of his belief the patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the performing of the act for which the registration is sought. The person who is making the declaration must be duly authorised to act on behalf of the applicant. The authorised person is ordinarily an officer of the company such as a director, the company secretary as registered with ACRA, or equivalent. Evidence of such authorisation of such a person by the applicant must accompany the declaration GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 17 of 170 at the point of submission. Examples of evidence of authorisation include a resolution of board of directors, a resolution of a general meeting of the company, or an extract of the relevant portion of the company's articles of association. Declaration forms must bear the original signature of the authorised person. Where an application is declared as a Category B application, HSA will require the applicant to serve a notice to the proprietor of the patent in the form specified in Appendix 1 - Form 2 of this guidance document. An applicant may also be required to serve a notice where HSA considers it appropriate. The information contained in this section serves solely as guidance on the requirement for submission of declaration on patent status for the purpose of product registration. HSA does not provide advice on the category under which an application should be declared or whether a therapeutic product is subject to a subsisting patent. An applicant requiring such assistance should seek appropriate legal advice. 4 PROTECTION OF CONFIDENTIAL SUPPORTING INFORMATION AND REGISTRATION EXCLUSIVITY Regulation 26 and 29 of the Regulations provide for protection of confidential supporting information relating to innovative therapeutic product applications and exclusivity of safety and efficacy data, respectively. Confidential information received in support of the registration of an innovative therapeutic product is protected for a period of 5 years from the date of receipt, during which HSA will not use the information to determine whether to grant any other registration applications. In this regard, confidential supporting information refers to trade secrets and information that has commercial value that would be, or is likely to be, diminished by disclosure. A 5-year period of exclusivity is granted for a therapeutic product for which safety and efficacy data has been generated in support of its registration. During the exclusivity period, a subsequent similar therapeutic product will not be able to rely on such data generated for the earlier therapeutic product to obtain registration. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 18 of 170 CHAPTER B REGISTRATION PROCESS A company seeking to market a therapeutic product in Singapore must obtain marketing approval from HSA through making an application for product registration. The registration process involves a series of steps, as shown in Figure 1. PRE-SUBMISSION PREPARATION APPLICATION SUBMISSION APPLICATION SCREENING APPLICATION EVALUATION REGULATORY DECISION POST-APPROVAL CHANGES NON-ACCEPTANCE / WITHDRAWAL ACCEPTANCE APPROVAL NON-APPROVAL / WITHDRAWAL Figure 1 Registration Process for a Therapeutic Product GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 19 of 170 5 PRE-SUBMISSION PREPARATION The following are important considerations for an applicant to register a therapeutic product: (a) Knowing which type of application to apply for; (b) Knowing which evaluation route to choose; and (c) Understanding the requirements as specific in this guidance. 5.1 Product Types A therapeutic product could contain either chemical or biological entity(ies) as the active ingredient(s). A chemical entity refers to any chemical element, naturally occurring chemical material or chemical product obtained by chemical change or synthesis (including macromolecules produced by chemical synthesis, such as peptides/oligo- nucleotides), or any metabolites from a micro-organism (such as antibiotics). A biological entity refers to any macromolecule extracted from an organism (such as proteins, nucleic acids, proteoglycans, cytokines and growth factors), or any substance derived from a biological system, including any of the following: (a) A whole cell or micro-organism, such as a whole virus or bacterium used as a vaccine; (b) A part of a micro-organism, such as a sub-unit vaccine; (c) A plasma-derived product; or (d) A biotechnology-derived substance, such as a protein or polypeptide. 5.2 Application Types In applying for a new product registration for a therapeutic product in Singapore, there are two categories of applications - a new drug application (NDA) and a generic drug application (GDA): GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 20 of 170 NDA New Drug Application NDA-1: For the first strength of a product containing a new3 chemical or biological entity. NDA-2 : (a) For the first strength of a product (i) containing a new combination of registered chemical or biological entities; (ii) containing registered chemical or biological entity(ies) in a new dosage form (e.g. tablets, capsules, injectables), new presentation (e.g. single-dose vials, multi-dose vials, pre-filled syringe, starter packs), or new formulation (e.g. preservative-free); (iii) containing registered chemical or biological entity(ies) for use by a new route of administration; or, (iv) containing registered chemical or biological entity(ies) for new indication(s), dosage recommendation(s) and/or patient population(s). (b) For products that do not fall under the descriptions for NDA-1, NDA-3 or GDA. NDA-3: For subsequent strength(s) of a product that has been registered or has been submitted as an NDA-1 or NDA-2. The product name, active ingredient, dosage form, presentation, indication, dosing regimen and patient population should be the same as that for the NDA-1 or NDA-2. 3 i.e. not a currently registered entity in Singapore. Currently registered therapeutic products can be found in the Register of Therapeutic Products at www.hsa.gov.sg. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 21 of 170 GDA Generic Drug Application A generic drug application applies to a therapeutic product that contains one or more chemical entities, and that is essentially the same as a current registered product with respect to its qualitative and quantitative composition of active ingredients, pharmaceutical dosage form and clinical indication. Follow-on biologic products (also known as biosimilar products) are not eligible for a GDA and are required to be submitted via a NDA. GDA-1: For the first strength of a generic chemical product. GDA-2: For subsequent strength(s) of the generic chemical product that has been registered or submitted as GDA-1. The product name and dosage form should be the same as that for the GDA-1. In cases where multiple strengths of a generic product are submitted together, the strength of the product used in the BE study is considered as GDA-1. The remaining strength(s) should be submitted as GDA-2. Figure 2 is a schematic diagram illustrating the various types of applications: Post-Approval Process, Chapter F GDA - 2 IS PRODUCT REGISTERED? First strength of product? Fulfils definition of a generic product? NDA - 1 Contains new chemical or biological entity? NO YES YES NO NDA - 2 NDA - 3 GDA - 1 NO NO YES YES Figure 2 Schematic Diagram of Application Routes for Drug Registration GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 22 of 170 5.3 Evaluation Routes There are four types of evaluation routes for registering a new therapeutic product: Full route: Applies to any new product that has not been approved by any drug regulatory agency at the time of application submission to HSA. Abridged route: Applies to any new or generic product that has been evaluated and approved by at least one drug regulatory agency. Verification route: Applies to any new or generic product that has been evaluated and approved by HSA's reference drug regulatory agencies, which are EMA4, US FDA, Health Canada, TGA and UK MHRA5. Verification-CECA route: Applies to any generic product manufactured in India which has been evaluated and approved by HSA's reference drug regulatory agencies, which include EMA4, US FDA, Health Canada, TGA and UK MHRA5. Applicants should refer to Chapters C , D and E for detailed information about the selection of appropriate evaluation routes for NDA, GDA and Biosimilar product applications, respectively. 5.4 Pre-Submission Consultation Mechanisms There is a range of mechanism that enable companies to self-help, which includes the use of guidelines, flow charts, frequently asked questions (FAQ) and self-help tools as alternatives to pre-submission meeting. For more information on TPB's pre-submission consultation mechanisms, refer to the website: Pre-submission Consultation Mechanisms 4 For products approved via the Centralised Procedure 5 For products approved via the national procedure or where MHRA acted as the RMS for the MRP or Decentralised Procedures on or prior to 31 January 2020 when the UK has formally left the European Union GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 23 of 170 5.4.1 Pre-Submission Notification A pre-submission meeting is not compulsory for making an application to HSA. Nonetheless, the applicant is required to notify HSA at least two months prior to the intended submission date for applications submitted via the full evaluation route. The notification should include information on the product name (if available), active ingredient(s), summaries of the quality, non-clinical and clinical data (e.g. Overviews), planned submissions in other countries, and planned date of submission to HSA. 5.4.2 Pre-Submission Meeting An applicant may request for a pre-submission meeting to seek HSA's advice on specific issues relating to the data package for supporting an application submission, if the issue could not be addressed by the self-help mechanisms provided at Pre-submission Consultation Mechanisms . A pre-submission meeting is reserved for scientific discussion and does not provide for screening or checking of the submission dossier for the applicant. To ensure the correctness of the application type and the completeness of the dossier, please refer to the documentary requirements sections in this guidance.

The date of receipt of the actual technical dossier by HSA will be taken as the submission date where the processing time starts. Application dossiers should be organised in a CTD format. The CTD provides a common format for the preparation of a well-structured submission dossier. It uses a modular framework described in ICH Topic M4 and ASEAN guidelines on the Common Technical Document for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human use: Organisation of the Dossier . This guidance document should be read in conjunction with the current version of the ICH CTD and the ASEAN CTD (ACTD) guidance documents. Either the ICH CTD or the ACTD format is acceptable for making a submission to HSA. Table 1 summarises the organisation of the respective format: Table 1 Format of the ICH CTD and ACTD Documents Location in ICH CTD ACTD Administrative Documents and Product Information Module 1 Part I Common Technical Document Overview and Summaries Module 2 Incorporated in Parts II, III and IV Quality documents Module 3 Part II Non-clinical documents Module 4 Part III Clinical documents Module 5 Part IV Application checklists for both ICH CTD and ACTD dossiers are provided in Appendix 2A and 3A, respectively, to guide applicants on the submission requirements and to ensure completeness of the dossier. Each application must be accompanied by a checklist duly completed by the applicant and attached in PRISM . GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 26 of 170 Applicants should note that the CTD format cannot be changed once the application is submitted. Any subsequent variation applications for the product should follow the same format. 6.2.1 Submission Requirements The complete application dossier - i.e. Modules 1 to 5 of the ICH CTD or Parts I to IV of the ACTD - must be submitted in an electronic format. All documents required under Module 1/Part I must be submitted in softcopy in PRISM. Colour scanned copy of the original documents should be submitted and original hardcopy of documents are not required. However, HSA reserves the rights to request for the submission of the original or certified true copy of the submitted document if there is any doubt that the submitted scanned document is not an accurate reflection of the original document. Please refer to section 6.2.3 for more information on certifying non-original documents if the original documents cannot be provided. For Modules 2 to 5/Parts II to IV, applicants can opt to attach the documents either in full into PRISM section 7 (Supporting Attachments) or submit the softcopies (e.g. PDF format) in a CD/DVD. Submitting a CD or DVD When submitting a CD/DVD, applicants are encouraged to organise the dossier (i.e. folders and subfolders) according to the CTD format and to include bookmarks in all documents to facilitate the retrieval of documents. Files containing the below scripts will not be accepted due to cybersecurity reasons: GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 27 of 170 As a general guide, folder or file names should not be named with \"xxx .P (e.g. \"3.2.P\"). The CD/DVD should be properly labelled or accompanied by a letter with the following information: PRISM application number; PRISM submission date; Product name; Application type; Contents of the CD/DVD (e.g. Module 2, 3 and 5); and Applicant's email address. Upon receipt of the CD/DVD, HSA will issue an acknowledgement email to the applicant via the email address provided with the CD/DVD submission. Applicants must ensure the access to the content of CD/DVD. For protected files, password(s) must be provided as appropriate. Upon acceptance of the application for evaluation, applicants will be notified if additional copies of clinical documents (in CD/DVD) will be required. Note: We are unable to accept submission of dossier via any digital portable devices (e.g. flash memory sticks). GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 28 of 170 6.2.2 Language and Translation All documents submitted in support of an application to HSA must be in English. For documents in their original language which is not English, a certified translation or a verified translation may be acceptable. Translation type Type of Documents Requirements Certified Translation Official certificates issued by the drug regulatory agency of a country Proof of approval issued by the drug regulatory agency of a country Notarisation & Authentication (a) Notarisation These documents must be notarised by a notary public in country where document is issued. Details of particulars to be included by notary: (i) The name of the notary; (ii) A statement that the notary is duly admitted to practice in the place of issue of the certificate; (iii) The names of the signatories and the capacity in which they have executed the document, whether on their own behalf or in an official or representative capacity; (iv) A statement authenticating the signatures of the parties and, where appropriate, indicating that evidence has been produced to the notary proving the capacity in which they have executed the document; (v) The place and date of issue of the notarial certificate; and (vi) The signature and seal of the notary. (b) Authentication GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 29 of 170 These documents must be authenticated (i.e. the origin of the document is attested to) by one of the following government bodies: (i) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the country in which the document was issued; or (ii) The Singapore Embassy/Consulate in the country where the document was issued. Applicants are advised to consult the Singapore Embassy/Consulate in the country where the document originated regarding the local requirements for document legalisation, as these may deviate from the process as outlined in the preceding paragraph. Verified Translation Technical documents (e.g. package insert, submission dataset) Verification Document A verification document must be provided by the translator of the document into the English language. The verification document must state that the translation into English is accurate . Details of particulars to be included in verification document: (i) the name of translator; (ii) a statement that he/she is well versed in English and the relevant foreign language; and (iii) a reference to the document being translated. Refer to the sample verification document for translator enclosed in Appendix 4. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 30 of 170 With Singapore acceding to the Apostillle Convention on 16 September 2021, for certified translated document issued by a country which acceded to the Apostille Convention, an apostille certificate can be submitted in lieu of a notarised/authenticated certified translation. 6.2.3 Certifying Non-Original Documents If the softcopy official document (e.g. CPP, GMP certificate) submitted to HSA in PRISM is not a scan of the original document, the document must be certified prior to submission. A certified true copy certifies that the photocopy presented is a true and accurate copy of the original document. Acceptable certification of documents to support therapeutic product applications to HSA can be done by the Company Director or Company Secretary as registered with ACRA or above, or by an independent authority such as a lawyer, notary public, Commissioner for Oaths/Declarations/Affidavits, Justice of Peace, the original issuer of the document or Embassy/Consulate. A notarised and authenticated copy is the same as a certified true copy. A certified true copy of an approval letter requires certification by the drug regulatory agency that issued the approval letter, a notary public or the Singapore Embassy/Consulate in the country where the approval letter was issued. Certification of an approval letter is not required if the approval letter is available on the drug regulatory agency's website. In this instance, applicants can provide the internet address (URL) for validation by HSA. 7 APPLICATION SCREENING Following a submission made via PRISM and the receipt of the application dossier by HSA, the application will be screened to ensure the correctness of the application type and the completeness of the dossier. The date of receipt of the application dossier (i.e. the technical dossier [e.g. in a CD/DVD] including the application checklist) will be taken as the submission date and the start of the screening timeline. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 31 of 170 During screening, if an application is identified to be more appropriately submitted under a different application type, the applicant will be informed of this change and the necessary actions to effect this change via an Input Request. More information on the change in application type is described in section 12.2.1 Changes to Application Types and Re-routing of Evaluation During Screening . For applications submitted without the following documents, the applicant will be requested to withdraw the application as screening cannot proceed: Entire dossier sections (drug substance, drug product, clinical) Drug Master File (DMF) (if applicable)# For applications supported by DMF, a copy of the acknowledgment email from HSA on the receipt of the Letter of Access (if applicable) Application checklist in MS WORD format (Appendix 2 or 3) Assessment reports (for verification route) # Please refer to Appendix 11 for information on the documentary requirements in support of a DMF submission Applicants should ensure that the dossier is compiled according to the required format. Failure to adhere to the required CTD format will lead to the non-acceptance of the dossier without screening. If deficiencies are identified in an application dossier, a screening query stating the deficiencies will be issued via Input Request to the applicant. The stop-clock starts when an Input Request is sent and ends upon receipt of a complete and satisfactory response to the query. The total number of Input Requests sent during screening is capped at two. Applicants will be given 20 working days to respond to each Input Request, starting from the date the Input Request is sent. The application will only be accepted when all deficiencies have been adequately addressed and HSA is satisfied that the dossier is complete for evaluation. An acceptance notice will then be issued via PRISM and the date of acceptance of the application will be taken as the start of the evaluation timeline. For full and abridged GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 32 of 170 applications, applicants may be required to submit additional copies of the dossier in CD/DVD format after acceptance. If the applicant fails to address the deficiencies raised during screening, the application will not be accepted for evaluation. An Input Request will be issued to the applicant to withdraw the application. If the application is subsequently re- submitted, it will be processed as a new application. 8 APPLICATION EVALUATION Once the application is accepted, the evaluation stage begins. Evaluation queries may be issued via Input Request to the applicant if clarification or additional information is required. The stop-clock starts whenever HSA issues a query and ends upon the receipt of a complete and satisfactory response from the applicant. In situations where the applicant is unable to provide a complete response within the specified timeframe, the applicant should notify HSA as soon as possible after receiving HSA's queries. The application will be considered withdrawn if the applicant fails to observe the specified response deadline. Applicants are reminded that the submission of additional supporting data not requested by HSA following the acceptance of the application will not be considered, unless prior arrangement with HSA is made for the submission concerned. During the evaluation process, HSA may assess that the application is more suitably evaluated via an alternative route, in which case the application will be re-routed to the appropriate route. Any re-routing of the application will be discussed with the applicant. NOTE : The screening process only checks for the completeness of the application dossier for evaluation. The acceptance of the dossier for evaluation does not denote the adequacy of the data for regulatory approval. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 33 of 170 HSA may engage external evaluators, experts and advisory committees in the evaluation process, when necessary. These experts include scientists and clinicians from both local and overseas institutions. All external evaluators and experts are bound by agreement to protect the information made available to them. The identity of the external evaluators is kept confidential. 8.1 Evaluation Stages The progress status of the evaluation is available for certain application types and evaluation routes. Table 2 describes the applicable product applications and the stages of the evaluation: Table 2 Product Applications Applicable for Notification of Stages During Evaluation Stages of Notification to Applicant 1st Stage 2nd Stage 3rd Stage 4th Stage Application Type Evaluation Route Evaluation Status Acceptance for Evaluation Active Evaluation in Progress Evaluation at Midway Completed Evaluation NDA-1 NDA-2 NDA-3 Full or Abridged Application is accepted for evaluation.

GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 35 of 170 9 REGULATORY DECISION A regulatory decision is made following the conclusion of the benefit-risk assessment by HSA based on the data submitted in support of the application. Applicants will be notified of one of the following outcomes: Approval - the application satisfies the registration requirements for quality, safety and efficacy; Approvable - when the application can be approved subject to adequate response to minor deficiencies; Non-approvable - when the application has major deficiencies; or Rejection - when the response provided by the applicant fails to address the major deficiencies specified in HSA's non-approvable decision. 'Approval ' and ' rejection ' are final decisions issued by HSA. For an ' approvable ' application, the applicant will be informed of the conditions for approval and is required to fulfil these conditions within a stipulated timeframe prior to the grant of a final approval. For a ' non-approvable ' application, the applicant will be informed of the deficiencies leading to the non-approvable decision. If the applicant wishes to address the specified deficiencies, the response should be based on the original data set submitted to HSA and furnished within the stipulated timeframe. New data not previously reviewed by HSA during the evaluation of the application concerned will not be accepted. An application will be considered withdrawn if the applicant fails to reply within the stipulated timeframe subsequent to an ' approvable ' or a ' non-approvable ' decision. Once the application is withdrawn, it is considered closed and the applicant will be required to make a new application if he wishes to pursue the regulatory approval for the product concerned. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 36 of 170 Upon an ' approval ' regulatory decision, the product will be added to the Register of Therapeutic Products . HSA may register the product subject to post-approval commitments. In such circumstances, the applicant will be required to furnish a letter of commitment stating the undertakings concerned. Applicants must take note of the registration conditions and the post-approval commitments specified in the registration. The registration conditions can be viewed at Enquire@PRISM . For submission of documents to fulfil registration conditions, please use this form (Submission of Documents to Fulfil Therapeutic Product Registration Conditions - https://go.gov.sg/fulfil-tp-reg-conditions ). 10 POST-APPROVAL CHANGES Upon the registration of a product, product registrants are responsible for ensuring the product's quality, efficacy and safety through its life cycle. HSA must be notified of any changes to the product's quality, efficacy and safety as per Chapter F of this guidance. 11 TARGET PROCESSING TIMELINES Please refer to Appendix 5 for information on target processing timelines for the different application types and evaluation routes. 12 FEES As the fees may be subject to revision from time to time, applicants are advised to visit the HSA website for updated information on fees . Payment can be made via GIRO or other electronic payment modes such as eNets or eCredit card. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 37 of 170 Regardless of payment mode selection, the collection of both screening and evaluation fee for applications submitted via the full evaluation route occurs upon issuance of the screening outcome. 12.1 Screening Fee A screening fee is payable at the time of online submission via PRISM and is non- refundable once the application is submitted via PRISM. For payment via GIRO, the screening fee will be debited upon the successful submission of an online application. For payment via other electronic payment modes (i.e. eNETs or eCredit card), the screening fee must be paid before the application is considered successfully submitted online. 12.2 Evaluation Fee An evaluation fee is payable upon the acceptance of the dossier for evaluation and is non-refundable once the application is accepted. For payments via GIRO, the evaluation fee will be debited upon the acceptance of the application. For payments via other electronic payment modes (i.e. eNETs or eCredit card), the evaluation fee will be collected together with the screening fee. In the event that the application is not accepted for evaluation, the fee collected will be refunded to the applicant's bank account. NOTE: Applicants are strongly encouraged to apply for a GIRO account ( click here for GIRO application form ) with HSA to facilitate payments for future submissions and subsequent payment for retention fee for the registered products. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 38 of 170 Applicants may opt for the progressive payment scheme. This is an opt-in scheme eligible for applicants who make payment via GIRO and is only applicable to the application types listed in Table 3: Table 3 Product Applications Applicable for Progressive Payment Scheme Percentage of Evaluation Fee Payable at Each Stage Application Type Evaluation Route Evaluation Status Acceptance for Evaluation Active Evaluation in Progress Evaluation at Midway Completed Evaluation NDA-1 NDA-2 Abridged, Verification or Verification -CECA Once the application is submitted, the selected payment scheme (full or progressive) cannot be amended. Applicants who wish to change their selected payment scheme will have to withdraw and re-submit the application(s); and any upfront payment made (e.g. screening fee) is non-refundable. For applications under the progressive payment scheme, in the event that the application is withdrawn during the evaluation stage, any fees that had been charged, but not debited from the GIRO account would remain payable. Any paid fee is non-refundable. 12.2.1 Changes to Application Types and Re-routing of Evaluation During Screening If an application type or evaluation route is incorrectly selected, applicants will be informed via an Input Request. Such changes may result in a different evaluation fee upon acceptance of the application. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 39 of 170 In the situation where the applicant decides not to pursue the application due to the changes, the screening fee is not refundable. For applications which require withdrawal and resubmission, the screening fee is not refundable. 12.2.1.1 Change of Sub-Type within the Same Application Type This refers to a change in the sub-type of the selected application type (e.g. from NDA-1 to NDA-2, NDA-2 to NDA-3, or GDA-1 to GDA-2). The applicant will be informed of the change via an Input Request. However, applicants should not amend the application type field in the PRISM application form. The change will be effected by HSA at the point of acceptance of the application. In the situation where the applicant decides not to pursue the application due to the said change, the applicant must withdraw the application prior to acceptance to avoid the evaluation fee being charged. 12.2.1.2 Change of Application between Different Application Types This refers to a change in the application type between GDA to NDA or vice versa . The applicant will be required to withdraw and resubmit the application if the applicant intends to pursue the application. 12.2.1.3 Change of Evaluation Route This refers to a change in evaluation route (e.g. Full to Abridged, Verification to Abridged, Abridged to Verification, etc.). The applicant will be required to withdraw and resubmit the application if the applicant intends to pursue the application. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 40 of 170 CHAPTER C NEW DRUG APPLICATION SUBMISSION This chapter applies to new drug applications for products containing new chemical and biological entities. Applicants are advised to refer to Chapter E for new drug applications for biosimilar products. 13 APPLICATION TYPES NDA New Drug Application NDA-1: For the first strength of a product containing a new6 chemical or biological entity. NDA-2: (a) For the first strength of a product (i) containing a new combination of registered chemical or biological entities; (ii) containing registered chemical or biological entity(ies) in a new dosage form (e.g. tablets, capsules, injectables), new presentation (e.g. single-dose vials, multi-dose vials, pre-filled syringe, starter packs), or new formulation (e.g. preservative-free); (iii) containing registered chemical or biological entity(ies) for use by a new route of administration; or (iv) containing registered chemical or biological entity(ies) for new indication(s), dosage recommendation(s) and/or patient population(s).

GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 41 of 170 14 EVALUATION ROUTES There are three evaluation routes for an NDA - full, abridged and verification evaluation routes. The eligibility criteria are different for each evaluation route. Applicants should be familiar with the criteria for each evaluation route because each route has different documentary requirements. Figure 3 is a schematic diagram illustrating the evaluation routes for NDAs: 14.1 Full Evaluation Route Full evaluation applies to a product that has not been approved by any drug regulatory agency at the time of submission. For a submission under the full evaluation route, the applicant is required to notify HSA at least two months prior to the intended submission date of the application dossier. The notification should include information on the product name (if available), active ingredient(s), summaries of the quality, non-clinical and clinical data (e.g. Module 2.4 Non-clinical Overview, Module 2.5 Clinical Overview), planned submissions in other countries, and the planned date of submission to HSA. 14.2 Abridged Evaluation Route Abridged evaluation applies to a product that has been approved by at least one drug regulatory agency at the time of submission. Approved by HSA's reference agencies and meets verification criteria? Is the product registered with any drug regulatory agency? NO FULL ROUTE ABRIDGED ROUTE YES NO YES VERIFICATION ROUTE NDA Figure 3 Schematic Diagram of Evaluation Routes for NDAs GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 42 of 170 14.2.1 Priority Review For NDAs submitted via the abridged evaluation route, the applicant may request for priority review for a life-saving drug if there are unmet medical needs. The following are the criteria that will be considered for granting a priority review: (a) The drug is intended for the treatment of a serious life-threatening condition and demonstrates the potential to address local unmet medical needs, as defined by: (i) the absence of a treatment option; or (ii) the lack of safe and effective alternative treatments, such that the drug would be a significant improvement compared to available marketed products, as demonstrated by (A) evidence of increased effectiveness in treatment, prevention, or diagnosis; or (B) elimination or a substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction. (b) Disease conditions that are of local public health concern will be given primary consideration for priority review. Currently these include: (i) cancer; and (ii) infectious diseases: dengue, tuberculosis, hepatitis and malaria. The request for priority review should be made at the point of the application submission and accompanied by justifications (attached in PRISM; see section 15.1 - Introduction (CTD/PRISM section 1.3) ) for requesting for a priority review and how the product is expected to benefit patients, as substantiated by the following evidence: The seriousness of the disease condition, local and worldwide mortality rates, anticipated morbidity and debilitation as a consequence of the disease; Local epidemiology data and disease burden; The unmet needs, current available treatment options and standard therapies, and the inadequacy of current therapies; GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 43 of 170 The extent to which the product is expected to have a major impact on medical practice, its major benefit, and how it addresses the unmet needs; and Clinical evidence supporting the claims of significant improvement compared to available treatments. HSA reserves the right to deny a request for priority review if it is deemed appropriate. The decision for the granting of priority review would be conveyed to the applicant at the point of acceptance of the application for evaluation. 14.3 Verification Evaluation Route Therapeutic products with similar indication(s), dosing regimen(s), patient group(s), and/or direction(s) for use that have been approved by at least two of HSA's reference drug regulatory agencies may be eligible for submission via the verification evaluation route. HSA's reference drug regulatory agencies are: Australia Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA); Health Canada (HC); US Food and Drug Administration (FDA); European Medicines Agency (EMA) via the Centralised Procedure; and UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (UK MHRA) via \u00ad the national procedure, or \u00ad as the Reference Member State (RMS) via the Mutual Recognition Procedure or Decentralised Procedure on or prior to 31 January 2020 when the UK has formally left the European Union. However, approval by these reference drug regulatory agencies does not oblige HSA to approve the application. HSA may also re-categorise applications to other evaluation routes if the applications did not meet the eligibility criteria and/or submission requirements. The applicant must confirm one of the reference drug regulatory agencies as the primary reference agency. The chosen primary reference agency is defined as the reference drug regulatory agency from which the qualifying supporting documents (as outlined in this guidance) will be submitted. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 44 of 170 The pre-requisite requirements for the verification route include: The product has received full marketing approval by the reference agencies following a complete independent scientific assessment (i.e. the approval is not granted on the basis of less comprehensive data than normally would require or subject to post-approval conditions that require submission of additional data to confirm the product's benefit-risk profile); The application must be submitted to HSA within three years from the date of approval by the chosen primary reference agency; A declaration letter issued by the product owner/applicant must be provided stating that all aspects of the drug product's quality, including but not limited to the formulation, manufacturing site(s), release and shelf life specifications and primary packaging, are identical to that currently approved by the chosen primary reference agency at the time of submission. However, a different container closure system type (e.g. Alu/Alu blister vs. HDPE bottle) may be proposed to meet ASEAN stability requirements; If a Drug Master File is submitted, then a separate declaration letter issued by the applicant must also be provided to state that the DMF submitted to HSA is identical to that submitted to the chosen primary reference agency; The product does not need an independent assessment by HSA to contextualise the benefit-risk profile due to local disease epidemiology, medical practice and/or public health considerations. Examples of products that may require such contextualised assessment are anti-infectives, vaccines, etc.; and The product and its intended use - i.e. indication(s), dosing regimen(s) and patient group(s) - have not been rejected, withdrawn, or approved via appeal process or are not pending deferral by a drug regulatory agency for safety and/or efficacy reasons. The proposed indication(s), dosing regimen(s), patient group(s) and/or direction(s) for use should be the most stringent among those approved by the reference drug regulatory agencies. In the event that the chosen primary reference agency does not bear the most stringent indication(s), dosing regimen(s), patient group(s) and/or direction(s) of use, the clinical assessment report from the reference drug regulatory agency that does meet these requirements should be submitted. Reports from the GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 45 of 170 public domain are acceptable. The proposed PI/PIL should be identical to that bearing the most stringent indication(s), dosing regimen(s), patient group(s) and/or direction(s) of use (with the exception of country-specific information). 14.3.1 NDA-3 Applications For the NDA-3 application type, the verification evaluation route may be applied to the registration of subsequent strengths of a currently-registered product in Singapore. To qualify for the verification evaluation route for an NDA-3 application: if the product has been evaluated and approved by at least one of HSA's reference drug regulatory agencies, then the NDA-3 must be submitted within two years from the date of approval by that reference drug regulatory agency; or if the product has been evaluated and approved by at least two of HSA's reference drug regulatory agencies, then the NDA-3 must be submitted within three years from the date of approval by the chosen primary reference agency. All other eligibility criteria for the verification evaluation route as stated in section 14.3 above will apply to NDA-3 applications except for the following: The proposed indication(s), dosing regimen(s), patient group(s), and/or direction(s) for use must be identical to the corresponding approved NDA-1 and/or NDA-2 product(s); and The proposed PI/PIL should also be consistent with that currently approved for the corresponding NDA-1 and/or NDA-2 product(s). 15 DOCUMENTARY REQUIREMENTS Table 4 outlines the CTD Modules/Parts required for NDAs submitted under each evaluation route: GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 46 of 170 Table 4 Dossier Submission Requirements for NDAs Documents Location in Module/Part required for ICH CTD ACTD Full NDA Abridged NDA Verification NDA Administrative Documents Module 1 Part I Yes Yes Yes Common Technical Document Overview and Summaries Module 2 Incorporate d in Parts II, III and IV Yes Yes Yes Quality documents Module 3 Part II Yes Yes Yes Non-clinical documents Module 4 Part III Yes ICH: No# ACTD: Overview only ICH: No# ACTD: Overview only Clinical documents Module 5 Part IV Yes Study report(s) of pivotal studies and synopses of all studies (phase I-IV) relevant to requested indication, dosing and/or patient group Study report(s) of pivotal studies and synopses of all studies (phase I-IV) relevant to requested indication, dosing and/or patient group #Non-clinical overview included in Module 2 of the ICH CTD. 15.1 Administrative Documents The administrative documents relate to Module 1 of the ICH CTD or Part I of the ACTD and are applicable to all evaluation routes for NDAs.

Where applicable, examples of the batch numbering system should be included to illustrate how the batch number enables identification. Proof of Approval (CTD/PRISM sections 1.8, 1.9) Proof of approval is not required for NDAs undergoing a full evaluation. For an abridged evaluation of an NDA, proof of approval from a competent drug regulatory agency is required. A competent drug regulatory agency refers to a national regulatory authority participating in the World Health Organization's Certification Scheme on the Quality GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 50 of 170 of Pharmaceutical Products Moving in International Commerce, and listed as such on the World Health Organization's website. Proof of approval must come in the form of: a Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product (CPP) that is valid at the time of submission; or an official approval letter that certifies the product's registration status in the country at the point of submission to HSA); and the SPC, PI and/or PIL approved by the drug regulatory agency that issued the proof of approval. For a verification evaluation of an NDA, proof of approval from at least two (or at least one or two for NDA-3, depending on the eligibility criteria stated in section 14.3.1 NDA-3 Applications ) of HSA's reference drug regulatory agencies, including the chosen primary reference agency, is required. If the SPC is in a non-English language, applicants should refer to section 6.2.2 Language and Translation for more information on acceptable translations. Note that all aspects of the product's quality and intended direction(s) for use in Singapore should be the same as those approved by the drug regulatory agency that issued the proof of approval. If information such as the product formula, manufacturing sites, etc. are present in the CPP, the information should be consistent with that proposed for the Singapore market. Electronic CPPs issued by the regulatory authority are acceptable. NOTE: CPPs that indicate that the product is not licensed in the exporting country (including scenario where the product is licensed for \"solely for export only\") are not acceptable proof of approval. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 51 of 170 Approval letters should either be an original copy or a certified true copy and in English. Applicants should refer to sections 6.2.2 Language and Translation and 6.2.3 Certifying Non-Original Documents for more details. Reference to drug regulatory authority websites in the form of website screenshot and URL (for the website) for confirmation of the approval status of the products by that regulatory authority are acceptable, provided that the product's identity and product's ownership can be confirmed from that website, and the information stated on the website is in English. HSA reserves the right to request for an original hardcopy of the Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product (CPP), if deemed appropriate. If the brand name (trade name) of the product registered in the country which issued the proof of approval is different from that proposed in Singapore, the applicant is required to submit a declaration letter from the product owner to declare that both products marketed under the different brand names are identical in all aspects of quality, safety and efficacy except for the brand name. Authorisation Letters (CTD/PRISM section 1.10) All submitted authorisation letters should be on the authorising company's (i.e. product owner's) letterhead, dated and signed by the designated authorised person in the company. If the product owner is not the local applicant, manufacturer and/or batch releaser; or the product owner's address is different from that of the local applicant, manufacturer and/or batch releaser, then the following authorisation letter(s) must be submitted: (a) from Product Owner to the Applicant (Company) (1.10.1) - this letter authorises the local applicant to apply for and be the product registrant for a specific therapeutic product (product name to be stated as in PRISM) and be responsible for all matters pertaining to the registration of this product in Singapore. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 52 of 170 (b) from Product Owner to Manufacturer (1.10.2) - this letter authorises the specified manufacturer to produce, pack and/or label the drug product intended for Singapore. If there are multiple drug product manufacturers, then the applicant may opt to submit one authorisation letter which clearly states all of the manufacturers (names and addresses) and their responsibilities relating to the drug product (such as the manufacturing operation of each manufacturer in relation to the product being submitted). For biologic drug products, an additional authorisation letter from the product owner to the drug substance manufacturer is required. (c) from Product Owner to Batch Releaser (1.10.3) - this letter authorises the specified company to batch release the drug product. If there are multiple sites responsible for the batch release of the product, then the applicant may opt to submit one authorisation letter which clearly states all of the batch releasers (names and addresses) and their responsibilities. The applicant may also issue an authorisation letter to authorise the specified secondary packager located in Singapore to pack and/or label the drug product intended for Singapore. Applicants are to ensure that all names and addresses in the authorisation letters are consistent with the information provided in PRISM and the dossier. For manufacturers and batch releasers, the actual site address of the named company should be stated in the letter(s) - i.e. do not state the office address. Any discrepancy found will delay the registration process. All authorisation letters should also state specific product details, including the product name, dosage form and strength as stated in the PRISM application form. Applicants also have the option to combine the authorisation letters as stated above into one document, provided that all names, addresses and responsibilities are clearly stated. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 53 of 170 GMP Certification/Proof of GMP Compliance (CTD/PRISM section 1.11) a) Local Manufacturers For products manufactured at manufacturing sites located in Singapore, a valid Therapeutic Product Manufacturing Licence (TPML) is required at the point of product application submission. The valid and active TPML number of the manufacturer should be stated in the product application, and the submission of additional documentary evidence for the manufacturer is not required. b) Overseas Manufacturers and Batch Releasers Documentary evidence must be provided to certify that the manufacturer(s) complies with current applicable GMP standards. The proof of GMP compliance has to be submitted for all the following sites mentioned in the product submission: Drug substance manufacturer (for biological products); Finished product manufacturer performing bulk production (including solvent/diluent and drug product intermediate), primary and secondary packaging activities; and Batch releaser An applicant may submit one of the of the following document as supporting evidence: GMP certificate issued by a drug regulatory agency; CPP that bears the manufacturer's name(s) and address(es) and states that the certifying authority conducts periodic inspection of the manufacturing plant in which the manufacturing activity and dosage form is produced; or Reference to EudraGMP, the database of the European Community of manufacturing authorisations and of certificates of good manufacturing practice. Applicants making reference to the EudraGMP as the proof of GMP compliance should provide a screen capture of the EudraGMP website for the specific finished GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 54 of 170 product manufacturing site, as well as the URL to the website. Applicants should note that the names and addresses of all manufacturers should be consistent throughout the application - i.e. GMP certificate, Letter of Authorisation, CTD section S.2.1 and P.3.1 and PRISM. Certain accreditation documents/certificates issued by other drug regulatory agencies (for example, Japan/PMDA Accreditation Certificate of Foreign Drug Manufacturer, US/FDA Establishment Licence, Canada/Health Canada Establishment Licence) are not acceptable proof of GMP compliance. Proof of GMP compliance must be valid at the time of submission to HSA and must be in English. Applicants should refer to section 6.2.2 Language and Translation . If the submitted proof of GMP compliance is no longer valid or has less than 1 month's validity at the time of acceptance of the application for evaluation, HSA reserves the right to request for a commitment letter from the applicant to submit an updated and valid proof of GMP compliance by a specified date post- acceptance. It should be noted that diluents used for reconstituting the drug product and are packaged together with the drug product will be considered as part of the final drug product. Thus, manufacturer(s) of the supplied diluent(s) must follow the same requirements applicable to the drug product, e.g. provide proof of GMP compliance. For products manufactured in the USA or Canada, if the applicant is unable to obtain any proof of GMP compliance (in the form of a CPP or GMP certificate) from either US FDA/Health Canada or other drug regulatory agencies, the applicant is required to submit the latest Establishment Inspection Report (EIR) issued by US FDA or Inspection Exit Notice issued by Health Canada, and any other relevant supporting documents7 as proof of GMP compliance. The applicant is also required to provide the following information if not found in the inspection reports: 7 Any other supporting document which declares GMP compliance of the manufacturing site in the US and signed by an official of the US FDA. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 55 of 170 the last date of audit by US FDA/Health Canada; the approved dosage forms; any licensing conditions or restrictions; the scope of the inspection; and/or objective evidence and the date of a satisfactory close-out of the latest inspection conducted by US FDA/Health Canada. For products manufactured in Switzerland, if the applicant is unable to obtain any proof of GMP compliance (in the form of a CPP or GMP certificate) from either SwissMedic or other drug regulatory agencies, the Manufacturer's Licence issued by SwissMedic is an acceptable documentary GMP evidence. c) GMP Conformity Assessment for Overseas Manufacturers by HSA If the drug product is manufactured by a new overseas drug product manufacturing site not previously registered with HSA before 1st April 2004, a GMP Conformity Assessment will be conducted by HSA. Thus, when applicable, applicants must also submit the application form to request for GMP Evidence Evaluation or for an Overseas GMP Audit with the required documents to the Therapeutic Products Branch (as part of the product registration application) as stipulated in the Guidance Notes on GMP Conformity Assessment of an Overseas Manufacturer . The relevant GMP Conformity Assessment application form should be completed and submitted as a supporting document in the product registration application. Hardcopy submission is not required. In general, a GMP Conformity Assessment is applicable to each specific manufacturer, dosage form, manufacturing activities and applicant company. This also includes contract manufacturers who perform certain manufacturing activities, such as terminal sterilisation of the drug product, mixing of excipient with drug substance (drug product intermediate), etc. In general, applicant companies with active product registration that included the finished product manufacturer(s) performing the same manufacturing activities (excluding parametric release) for the same dosage form would not be required to GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 56 of 170 undergo another GMP Conformity Assessment by HSA when they submit a new product application which included the same finished product manufacturer(s). For drug product manufacturing sites that use parametric release (e.g. where a terminally sterilised product is released based on the review of manufacturing process data instead of sterility testing), a GMP Conformity Assessment is required for overseas drug product manufacturers. Eligibility criteria for such applications for overseas manufacturing sites are: a) Country of origin must be a PIC/S country; and b) Parametric release is approved by the local authority. If the above criteria are met, then an approval letter and recent documentary evidence of approval status (e.g. GMP Certificate) for parametric release issued by the local authority should be provided. The manufacturing site and the product proposed for parametric release should be clearly stated on these documents. For a local manufacturing site that would like to apply for parametric release, applicants are advised to contact HSA prior to submission as pre-approval inspection is required. HSA reserves the right to request for a GMP Conformity Assessment if deemed necessary, or to request for additional or updated documents as evidence of GMP compliance during the course of the registration process. HSA also reserves the right to conduct an audit of any overseas manufacturer irrespective of the documentary GMP evidence that is approved by HSA or any other PIC/S member authorities, if deemed appropriate. If in doubt whether a GMP Conformity Assessment by HSA is required for the manufacturing sites included in the submission, applicants are encouraged to complete and submit applications to request for GMP Conformity Assessment with the product registration application, and HSA will advise accordingly whether the GMP Conformity Assessment would be required. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 57 of 170 Please note that GMP Conformity Assessment application forms submitted without a valid pending product registration application would not be considered. Patent Declaration (CTD/PRISM section 1.12) A signed and dated patent declaration form is required for each NDA.

In addition to the ICH or ACTD technical content requirements, the following explanatory notes pertain to requirements specific to Singapore: 15.3.1 Body of Data - Drug Substance The ICH M4Q Technical Guidelines and ASEAN Common Technical Requirements (ACTR) provide details on the information to be included in the drug substance sections of an application dossier. All of the drug substance sections of the CTD - i.e. S.1 to S.7 - should be submitted in the application. If these sections are incomplete, then the dossier should make reference to a Drug Master File (DMF), Plasma Master File (PMF) or Certificate of Suitability of Monographs of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP). Because the drug product manufacturer is responsible for the quality control of the drug substance that is used in the drug product, applicants should note that the complete S section of the CTD dossier should be provided by the drug product manufacturer regardless of whether a DMF or a CEP has been submitted in support of a product application. Drug Master File (DMF) A Drug Master File (DMF) is a compilation of information on facilities, processes or components used in the manufacturing, processing, packaging and storing of a NOTE : If a drug product contains more than one drug substance, the information within Module 3.2.S (ICH CTD) or Part II.S (ACTD) must be provided in its entirety for each drug substance. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 63 of 170 drug that is submitted to the HSA. A DMF contains confidential information and is submitted solely at the discretion of the DMF holder. A DMF is submitted in support of a therapeutic product application, and will be reviewed only in connection with the review of an application. As such, a separate approval will not be issued for a DMF. Appendix 11 describes the DMF process and documentary requirements for DMF submission. Plasma Master File (PMF) A Plasma Master File (PMF) is required whenever a human plasma-derived product is used either as a drug substance or as an excipient, as the PMF contains information on the collection and control of source materials. The PMF may be submitted either as a stand-alone document or as part of the application dossier. Appendix 8 describes the PMF data requirements for submission. If the PMF is a stand-alone document, then it should be filed separately from the application dossier for pre-marketing evaluation. The applicant may cross-reference a PMF that is currently registered with HSA where applicable. Certificates of Suitability (CEP) A Certificate of Suitability is a document issued by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines and Healthcare (EDQM) that certifies the quality of a drug substance in compliance to the Ph. Eur. A CEP may be submitted in lieu of the CTD S Section or a DMF. If reference is made to a CEP, the applicant should submit a copy of the duly authorised, valid CEP, including all annexes. A duly authorised CEP should contain the following information in the ' Declaration of Access ' section of the CEP: name of the Product Owner or local applicant; name of the product to be registered - it is recommended that the dosage form and strength(s) also be stated; signature of the CEP holder; and GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 64 of 170 date of authorisation. The following additional requirements apply for CEP-based submissions: (a) If Ph. Eur. standard is claimed for the drug substance, the relevant CTDs should be submitted: (i) S.2.1; (ii) S.4.1 and S.4.4 from both the drug substance and drug product manufacturers; and (iii) S.6 and S.7 should be provided if the re-test period/shelf life is not stated on the CEP. (b) If other standards are claimed for the drug substance, the relevant CTDs should be submitted: (i) S.2.1; (ii) S.4.1 to S.4.5 from both drug substance and drug product manufacturers; and (iii) S.6 and S.7 should be provided if re-test period/shelf life is not stated on the CEP. If there is a CEP for animal-derived material used in the drug product, the applicant may submit the CEP together with the documents stipulated in Annex 1- section 1.1 of Appendix 9 Guideline on the Registration of Human Medicinal Products Containing Materials of Animal Origin . It is the applicant's responsibility to submit the latest CEP updates, with annexes, as soon as they are available from EDQM. Control of Drug Substance (CTD section 3.2.S.4) Batch analysis data should be provided by the drug substance and drug product manufacturers, and, if available, from the same drug substance batches. Analytical results should be provided from a minimum of two batches from each proposed NOTE : HSA reserves the right to request for any additional information about the CEP- certified drug substance if it is deemed appropriate. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 65 of 170 drug substance manufacturer and should be sufficient to support the specification(s) as well as to demonstrate consistency in manufacturing. The batches submitted should preferably be of production scale or at least pilot scale. Stability Data of Drug Substance (CTD section 3.2.S.7) At the time of submission, the minimum stability data required are as follows: At least 12 months of long term data and 6 months of accelerated data from at least three primary batches of the drug substance; and The batches should be at least of pilot scale and manufactured by a method that simulates the final commercial process. Where multiple drug substance manufacturers are proposed for registration, if it can be demonstrated that the submitted data is representative of the proposed sites, it may be acceptable to extrapolate the stability data from one site to the other sites, and stability data from each site may not be required at the point of submission. All the following criteria must be met for the stability data to be considered representative: The drug substance is manufactured using the same synthetic route and process. Scientific justification should be provided to demonstrate equivalence between the sites if differences exist; The drug substance is controlled by the same set of specifications; The drug substance is packaged in the same container closure system; and The drug substance is of comparable quality to the drug substance used in the stability batches. If any of the above criteria are not met, site-specific stability data are required to support the application. In addition, a commitment to conduct stability studies for one production batch of drug substance is required for each site that is not represented in the submitted stability studies. Stability data from a site not proposed for registration may also be provided as supporting data. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 66 of 170 15.3.2 Body of Data - Drug Product The ICH M4Q technical guideline and ACTR also provide details on the information to be included in the drug product sections of an application dossier. For drug product intermediates and diluents, separate drug product sections should be submitted. Pharmaceutical Development (CTD section 3.2.P.2) Detailed descriptions and discussions, with relevant data, which relate to the development, and hence quality, of the drug product should be provided in the relevant dossier sections. Examples include, but are not limited to: polymorphism, solubility or particle size of the drug substance and its effect on the product's quality; a description and the results of the formulation development; the rationale for the choice of dissolution method and a discussion of its discriminatory nature, with data; compatibility of the container closure system with the product or preservative efficacy test results; and optimisation of the manufacturing process, with data. Process Validation (CTD section 3.2.P.3.5) The description, documentation and complete results of the validation studies on the manufacturing process should be provided in the dossier in this section. Particular care should be taken to ensure that the documents include critical processes for the manufacturing process: for example, blend uniformity validation for oral dosage forms and terminal sterilisation or aseptic filling for sterile products. Applicants should refer to the ASEAN Guidelines on Submission of Manufacturing Process Validation Data for Drug Registration and the ASEAN Guideline on Process Validation Q&A for the minimum data requirements for process validation. Other relevant international guidelines may also be referred to as appropriate. Where ranges of batch sizes are proposed, it should be demonstrated that variations in batch size would not adversely alter the characteristics of the finished product. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 67 of 170 For drug product manufacturing sites that use parametric release (e.g. where a terminally sterilised product is released based on the review of manufacturing process data instead of sterility testing), a more detailed discussion with supporting data on the process validation of the specific product in the proposed pack size or fill volume should be provided. In addition, risk assessment for parametric release should be based on prior knowledge, consistency of performance of the steriliser, historical batch analysis data, risk of loading pattern/container/ contamination from the environment to product sterility, re-processing plan, etc. A detailed discussion on the control strategy should also be provided. This includes but is not limited to, a tabulation of all validated critical process parameters and loading patterns, a description of the process and requirements for the release/rejection of a batch, bioburden monitoring and control program, the segregation of sterile products from non-sterile products and the routine maintenance/re-validation program for the steriliser. Control of Excipients (CTD section 3.2.P.4) This section refers to all excipients used in the drug product formulation, including ingredients used in capsule shells and film coatings. The specifications and analytical method(s) for each excipient should be described, including the validation of any in-house test method(s), if applicable. Information on proprietary ingredients, such as flavourings, colourants, coatings, perfumes and/or printing inks, should be as detailed as possible. Applicants are advised not to use internal codes but instead to give commercial names for such ingredients. In cases where the formula of the proprietary ingredient is confidential, only the total quantity of the proprietary ingredient present in the final product needs to be captured in PRISM. The formula of the proprietary ingredient should then be provided by the proprietary ingredient manufacturer directly to HSA. A declaration letter from the proprietary ingredient manufacturer should also be provided, indicating that they will inform HSA (via email to HSA_TP_Enquiry@hsa.gov.sg ) should there be any change in the qualitative formulation of the proprietary ingredient. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 68 of 170 A CoA for an excipient may be submitted in lieu of the excipient's specifications. If the standard claimed for an excipient is an officially recognised compendial standard, it is sufficient to state that the excipient is tested according to the requirements of that standard, rather than reproducing the specifications found in the officially recognised compendial monograph. For excipients derived from human plasma, applicants should refer to the Appendix 8 for more information on the data requirements. For excipients derived from animal sources, applicants should refer to Appendix 9 for more information.

GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 79 of 170 In the event that the chosen primary reference agency does not bear the most stringent indication(s), dosing regimen(s), patient group(s) and/or direction(s) of use among those approved by the reference drug regulatory agencies, a supplemental clinical assessment report from the reference drug regulatory agency that approved the most stringent indication(s), dosing regimen(s), patient group(s) and/or direction(s) of use is required. Reports from the public domain are acceptable. The proposed PI/PIL should be identical to that bearing the most stringent indication(s), dosing regimen(s), patient group(s) and/or direction(s) of use (with the exception of country-specific information). GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 80 of 170 CHAPTER D GENERIC DRUG APPLICATION SUBMISSION This chapter applies to applications to register generic products. A generic drug application applies to a therapeutic product that contains one or more chemical entities, and that is essentially the same with a current registered product with respect to its qualitative and quantitative composition of active ingredients, pharmaceutical dosage form and clinical indication. Follow-on biologic products (also known as biosimilar products) are not eligible for a GDA and are required to be submitted via a NDA. 16 APPLICATION TYPES There are two application types for a generic drug application: GDA Generic Drug Application GDA-1: For the first strength of a generic chemical product. GDA-2: For subsequent strength(s) of the generic chemical product that has been registered or submitted as GDA-1. The product name and dosage form should be the same as that for the GDA-1. In cases where multiple strengths of a generic product are submitted together, the strength of the product used in the BE study is considered as a GDA-1. The remaining strength(s) should be submitted as GDA-2. 16.1 Generic Product A generic product must have the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active ingredients and be of the same pharmaceutical form as a currently registered product in Singapore (known as the 'Singapore reference product'). A generic product must demonstrate bioequivalence to the Singapore reference product via appropriate bioequivalence studies. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 81 of 170 The generic product must fulfil the following criteria: (a) the generic product is the same pharmaceutical dosage form as the Singapore reference product. However, different conventional oral immediate-release dosage forms (i.e. tablets and capsules) are considered to be the same pharmaceutical form; (b) the route of administration of the generic product is the same as the Singapore reference product; (c) the conditions of use for the generic product fall within the directions for use (including indication(s), dosing regimen(s) and patient group(s)) for the Singapore reference product; and (d) the generic product is bioequivalent with the Singapore reference product. 16.2 Singapore Reference Product The Singapore reference product must be a currently registered product that has been granted market authorisation based on the evaluation of the product's quality, efficacy and safety - i.e. a dossier with chemical, biological, pharmaceutical, pharmacological-toxicological and clinical data. If such a reference product is not registered in Singapore, then an alternate registered comparator product may be used if adequately justified (e.g. a registered generic therapeutic product widely used by local hospitals) by the applicant and agreed upon by HSA. The generic product should contain the same active ingredient(s) and strength(s) and be the same pharmaceutical dosage form as the Singapore reference product. For generic products containing a different salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of isomer, complex or derivative of the active ingredient compared to the Singapore reference product, applicants are required to submit data to demonstrate that the different form does not differ from the active ingredient in the Singapore reference product in terms of safety and/or efficacy. Applicants are advised to search HSA's Register of Therapeutic Products to identify the Singapore reference product. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 82 of 170 Applicants submitting GDAs should also refer to Appendix 10 and Common questions related to generic drug applications for further details on product interchangeability and biowaiver requests. 17 EVALUATION ROUTES There are three evaluation routes for a GDA: abridged, verification and verification- CECA evaluation routes. The eligibility criteria are different for each evaluation route. Applicants should be familiar with the criteria for each evaluation route because each route has different documentary requirements. Figure 4 is a schematic diagram illustrating the evaluation routes for GDAs: 17.1 Abridged Evaluation Route Abridged evaluation applies to a product that has been approved by at least one drug regulatory agency at the time of submission. 17.2 Verification Evaluation Route Therapeutic products that have been approved by at least one of HSA's reference drug regulatory agencies may be eligible for submission via the verification evaluation route. HSA's reference drug regulatory agencies are: Australia Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA); Approved by at least one of HSA's reference agencies and meets verification criteria? GDA ABRIDGED ROUTE VERIFICATION ROUTE Product is manufactured in India and meets CECA scheme criteria? VERIFICATION -CECA ROUTE NO YES NO YES Figure 4 Schematic Diagram of Evaluation Routes for GDAs GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 83 of 170 Health Canada; US Food and Drug Administration (FDA); European Medicines Agency (EMA) via the Centralised Procedure; and UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (UK MHRA) via \u00ad the national procedure; or \u00ad as the Reference Member State (RMS) via the Mutual Recognition Procedure or Decentralised Procedure on or prior to 31 January 2020 when the UK has formally left the European Union. However, approval by these reference drug regulatory agencies does not oblige HSA to approve the application. The pre-requisite requirements for the verification route include: (a) The application must be submitted to HSA within two years from the date of approval by the chosen reference drug regulatory agency; (b) A declaration letter issued by the product owner/applicant must be provided stating that all aspects of the product's quality, including but not limited to the formulation, manufacturing site(s), release and shelf life specifications and primary packaging, are identical to that currently approved by the chosen reference drug regulatory agency at the time of submission. However, a different container closure system type (e.g. Alu/Alu blister vs. HDPE bottle) may be proposed to meet ASEAN stability requirements; (c) If a Drug Master File is submitted, then a separate declaration letter issued by the applicant must also be provided to state that the DMF submitted to HSA is identical to that submitted to the chosen reference drug regulatory agency; (d) The product and its intended use - i.e. indication(s), dosing regimen(s) and patient group(s) - have not been rejected, withdrawn, or approved via appeal process or are not pending deferral by a drug regulatory agency for efficacy and/or safety reasons. The chosen reference drug regulatory agency is defined as the reference drug regulatory agency for which the qualifying supporting documents (as outlined in this guidance) will be submitted.

Proof of Approval (CTD/PRISM sections 1.8, 1.9) Proof of approval is not required for GDAs undergoing abridged evaluation for finished products manufactured (up to primary packaging) in Singapore. For an abridged evaluation of an imported GDA, proof of approval from a competent drug regulatory agency is required. For a verification or verification-CECA evaluation of a GDA, proof of approval from the chosen reference drug regulatory agency is required. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 88 of 170 A competent drug regulatory agency refers to a national regulatory authority participating in the World Health Organization's Certification Scheme on the Quality of Pharmaceutical Products Moving in International Commerce, and listed as such on the World Health Organization's website. Proof of approval must come in the form of: a Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product (CPP) that is valid at the time of submission; or an official approval letter that certifies the product's registration status in the country at the point of submission to HSA); and the SPC, PI and/or PIL approved by the drug regulatory agency that issued the proof of approval. If the SPC is in a non-English language, applicants should refer to section 6.2.2 Language and Translation of this guidance document for more information on acceptable translations. Note that all aspects of the product's quality should be the same as those approved by the drug regulatory agency that issued the proof of approval. If information such as the product formula, manufacturing sites, etc. are present in the CPP, the information should be consistent with that proposed for the Singapore market. Electronic CPPs issued by the regulatory authority are acceptable. NOTE: CPPs that indicate that the product is not licensed for marketing in the exporting country (including scenario where the product is licensed for \"solely for export only\") are not acceptable proof of approval. Approval letters should either be an original copy or a certified true copy and in English. Applicants should refer to sections 6.2.2 Language and Translation and 6.2.3 Certifying Non-Original Documents for more details. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 89 of 170 Reference to drug regulatory authority websites in the form of website screenshot and URL (for the website) for confirmation of the approval status of the products in that regulatory authority are acceptable, provided that the product's identity and product's ownership can be confirmed from that website, and the information stated on the website is in English. HSA reserves the right to request for a Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product (CPP), if deemed appropriate. If the brand name (trade name) of the product registered in the country which issued the proof of approval is different from that proposed in Singapore, the applicant is required to submit a declaration letter from the product owner to declare that both products marketed under the different brand names are identical in all aspects of quality, safety and efficacy except for the brand name. Authorisation Letters (CTD/PRISM section 1.10) All submitted authorisation letter(s) should be on the authorising company's (i.e. product owner's) letterhead, dated and signed by the designated authorised person in the company. If the product owner is not the local applicant, manufacturer and/or batch releaser; or the product owner's address is different from that of the local applicant firm, manufacturer and/or batch releaser, then the following authorisation letter(s) must be submitted: (a) from Product Owner to the Applicant (Company) (1.10.1) - this letter authorises the local applicant to apply for and be the product registrant for a specific therapeutic product (product name to be stated as in PRISM) and be responsible for all matters pertaining to the registration of this product in Singapore. (b) from Product Owner to Manufacturer (1.10.2) - this letter authorises the specified manufacturer to produce, pack and/or label the drug product intended for Singapore. If there are multiple drug product manufacturers, then the applicant may opt to submit one authorisation letter which clearly states all of the manufacturers (names and addresses) and their responsibilities relating to GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 90 of 170 the drug product (such as the manufacturing operation of each manufacturer in relation to the product being submitted). (c) from Product Owner to Batch Releaser (1.10.3) - this letter authorises the specified company to batch release the drug product. If there are multiple sites responsible for the batch release of the product, then the applicant may opt to submit one authorisation letter which clearly states all of the batch releasers (names and addresses) and their responsibilities. The applicant may also issue an authorisation letter to authorise the specified secondary packager located in Singapore to pack and/or label the drug product intended for Singapore. Applicants are to ensure that all names and addresses in the authorisation letter(s) are consistent with the information provided in PRISM and the dossier. For manufacturers and batch releasers, the actual site address of the named company should be stated in the letter(s) - i.e. do not state the office address. Any discrepancy found will delay the registration process. All authorisation letters should also state specific product details, including the product name, dosage form and strength as stated in the PRISM application form. Applicants also have the option to combine the authorisation letters as stated above into one document, provided that all names, addresses and responsibilities are clearly stated. GMP Certification/Proof of GMP Compliance (CTD/PRISM section 1.11) a) Local Manufacturers For products manufactured at manufacturing sites located in Singapore, a valid Therapeutic Product Manufacturing Licence (TPML) is required at the point of product application submission.

GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 91 of 170 b) Overseas Manufacturers and Batch Releasers Documentary evidence must be provided to certify that the manufacturer(s) complies with current applicable GMP standards. The proof of GMP compliance has to be submitted for all the following sites mentioned in the product submission: Finished product manufacturer performing bulk production (including solvent/diluent and drug product intermediate), primary and secondary packaging activities Batch releaser An applicant may submit one of the of the following document as supporting evidence: GMP certificate issued by a drug regulatory agency; CPP that bears the manufacturer's name(s) and address(es) and states that the certifying authority conducts periodic inspection of the manufacturing plant in which the manufacturing activity and dosage form is produced; or Reference to EudraGMP, the database of the European Community of manufacturing authorisations and of certificates of good manufacturing practice. Applicants making reference to the EudraGMP as the proof of GMP compliance should provide a screen capture of the EudraGMP website for the specific finished product manufacturing site, as well as the URL to the website. Applicants should note that the names and addresses of all manufacturers should be consistent throughout the application - i.e. GMP certificate, Letter of Authorisation, CTD section S.2.1 and P.3.1 and PRISM. Certain accreditation documents/certificates issued by other drug regulatory agencies (for example, Japan/PMDA Accreditation Certificate of Foreign Drug Manufacturer, US/FDA Establishment Licence, Canada/Health Canada Establishment Licence) are not acceptable proof of GMP compliance. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 92 of 170 Proof of GMP compliance must be valid at the time of submission to HSA and must be in English. Applicants should refer to section 6.2.2 Language and Translation . If the submitted proof of GMP compliance is no longer valid or has less than 1 month's validity at the time of acceptance of the application for evaluation, HSA reserves the right to request for a commitment letter from the applicant to submit an updated and valid proof of GMP compliance by a specified date post-acceptance. It should be noted that diluents used for reconstituting the drug product and are packaged together with the drug product will be considered as part of the final drug product. Thus, manufacturer(s) of the supplied diluent(s) must follow the same requirements applicable to the drug product, e.g. provide proof of GMP compliance. For products manufactured in the USA or Canada, if the applicant is unable to obtain any proof of GMP compliance (in the form of a CPP or GMP certificate) from either US FDA/Health Canada or other drug regulatory agencies, the applicant is required to submit the latest Establishment Inspection Report (EIR) issued by US FDA or Inspection Exit Notice issued by Health Canada, and any other relevant supporting documents11 as proof of GMP compliance. The applicant is also required to provide the following information if not found in the inspection reports: the last audited date by US FDA/Health Canada; the approved dosage forms; any licensing conditions/restriction; the scope of inspection; and/or objective evidence and the date of a satisfactory close-out of the latest inspection conducted by US FDA/Health Canada. 11 Any other supporting document which declares GMP compliance of the manufacturing site in the US and signed by an official of the US FDA. NOTE : For applications submitted via the verification-CECA evaluation route, a valid GMP certificate and the latest inspection report as issued by the chosen reference drug regulatory agency must be submitted. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 93 of 170 For products manufactured in Switzerland, if the applicant is unable to obtain any proof of GMP compliance (in the form of a CPP or GMP certificate) from either SwissMedic or other drug regulatory agencies, the Manufacturer's Licence issued by SwissMedic is an acceptable documentary GMP evidence. c) GMP Conformity Assessment for Overseas Manufacturers by HSA If the drug product is manufactured by a new overseas drug product manufacturing site not previously registered with HSA before 1st April 2004, a GMP Conformity Assessment will be conducted by HSA. Thus, when applicable, applicants must also submit the application form to request for GMP Evidence Evaluation or for an Overseas GMP Audit with the required documents to the Therapeutic Products Branch (as part of the product registration application) as stipulated in the Guidance Notes on GMP Conformity Assessment of an Overseas Manufacturer . The relevant GMP Conformity Assessment application form should be completed and submitted as a supporting document in the product registration application. Hardcopy submission is not required. In general, a GMP Conformity Assessment is applicable to each specific manufacturer, dosage form, manufacturing activities and applicant company. This also includes contract manufacturers who perform certain manufacturing activities, such as terminal sterilisation of the drug product, mixing of excipient with drug substance (drug product intermediate), etc. In general, applicant companies with active product registration that included the finished product manufacturer(s) performing the same manufacturing activities (excluding parametric release) for the same dosage form would not be required to undergo another GMP Conformity Assessment by HSA when they submit a new product application which included the same finished product manufacturer(s). For drug product manufacturing sites that use parametric release (e.g. where a terminally sterilised product is released based on the review of manufacturing process data instead of sterility testing), a GMP Conformity Assessment is required GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 94 of 170 for overseas drug product manufacturers. Eligibility criteria for such applications for overseas manufacturing sites are: a) Country of origin must be a PIC/S country b) Parametric release is approved by the local authority If the above criteria are met, then approval letter and recent documentary evidence of approval status (e.g. GMP Certificate) for parametric release issued by the local authority should be provided. The manufacturing site and the product proposed for parametric release should be clearly stated on these documents. For local manufacturing site that would like to apply for parametric release, applicants are advised to contact HSA prior to submission as pre-approval inspection is required. HSA reserves the right to request for a GMP Conformity Assessment if deemed necessary, or to request for additional or updated documents as evidence of GMP compliance during the course of the registration process. HSA also reserves the right to conduct an audit of any overseas manufacturer irrespective of the documentary GMP evidence that is approved by HSA or any other PIC/S member authorities, if deemed appropriate. If in doubt whether a GMP Conformity Assessment by HSA is required for the manufacturing sites included in the submission, applicants are encouraged to complete and submit applications to request for GMP Conformity Assessment with the product registration application, and HSA will advise accordingly whether the GMP Conformity Assessment would be required. Please note that GMP Conformity Assessment application forms submitted without a valid pending product registration application would not be considered.

In addition to the ICH or ACTD technical content requirements, the following explanatory notes pertain to requirements specific to Singapore: GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 98 of 170 18.3.1 Body of Data - Drug Substance The ICH M4Q technical guideline and ASEAN Common Technical Requirements (ACTR) provide details on the information to be included in the drug substance sections of an application dossier. All of the drug substance sections of the CTD - i.e. S1 to S7 - should be submitted in the application. If these sections are incomplete, then the dossier should make reference to a Drug Master File (DMF) or Certificate of Suitability of Monographs of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP). Because the drug product manufacturer is responsible for the quality control of the drug substance that is used in the drug product, applicants should note that the complete S section of the CTD dossier should be provided by the drug product manufacturer regardless of whether a DMF or a CEP has been submitted in support of a product application. Drug Master File (DMF) A Drug Master File (DMF) is a compilation of information on facilities, processes or components used in the manufacturing, processing, packaging and storing of a drug that is submitted to the HSA. A DMF contains confidential information and is submitted solely at the discretion of the DMF holder. A DMF is submitted in support of a therapeutic product application, and will be reviewed only in connection with the review of an application. As such, a separate approval will not be issued for a DMF. Appendix 11 describes the DMF process and documentary requirements for DMF submission. Certificates of Suitability (CEP) NOTE : If a drug product contains more than one drug substance, the information within Module 3.2.S (ICH CTD) or Part 2.S (ACTD) must be provided in its entirety for each drug substance. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 99 of 170 A Certificate of Suitability is a document issued by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines and Healthcare (EDQM) that certifies the quality of a drug substance in compliance to the Ph. Eur. A CEP may be submitted in lieu of the CTD S Section or a DMF. If reference is made to a CEP, the applicant should submit a copy of the duly authorised, valid CEP, including all annexes. A duly authorised CEP should contain the following information in the ' Declaration of Access ' section of the CEP: name of the Product Owner or local applicant; name of the product to be registered - it is recommended that the dosage form and strength(s) also be stated; signature of the CEP holder; and date of authorisation. The following additional requirements apply for CEP-based submissions: (a) If Ph. Eur. standard is claimed for the drug substance, the relevant CTDs should be submitted: (i) S.2.1; (ii) S.4.1 and S.4.4 from both the drug substance and drug product manufacturers; and (iii) S.6 and S.7 should be provided if the re-test period/shelf life is not stated on the CEP. (b) If other standards are claimed for the drug substance, the relevant CTDs should be submitted: (i) S.2.1; (ii) S.4.1 to S.4.5 from both drug substance and drug product manufacturers; and (iii) S.6 and S.7 should be provided if re-test period/shelf life is not stated on the CEP. NOTE : HSA reserves the right to request for any additional information about the CEP- certified drug substance if it is deemed appropriate. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 100 of 170 If there is a CEP for animal-derived material used in the drug product, the applicant may submit the CEP together with the documents stipulated in Annex 1- section 1.1 of Appendix 9 Guideline on the Registration of Human Medicinal Products Containing Materials of Animal Origin . It is the applicant's responsibility to submit the latest CEP updates, with annexes, as soon as they are available from EDQM. Control of Drug Substance (CTD section 3.2.S.4) Batch analysis data should be provided by the drug substance and drug product manufacturers, and if available, from the same drug substance batches. Analytical results should be provided from a minimum of two batches from each proposed drug substance manufacturer and should be sufficient to support the specification(s) as well as to demonstrate consistency in manufacturing. The batches submitted should preferably be of production scale or at least pilot scale and should include the batch(es) used in the bioequivalence or biowaiver studies (where applicable). Stability Data of Drug Substance (CTD section 3.2.S.7) At the time of submission, the minimum stability data required are as follows: At least 12 months of long term data and 6 months of accelerated data from at least three primary batches of the drug substance; and The batches should be at least of pilot scale and manufactured by a method that simulates the final commercial process. Where multiple drug substance manufacturers are proposed for registration, if it can be demonstrated that the submitted data is representative of the proposed sites, it may be acceptable to extrapolate the stability data from one site to the other sites, and stability data from each site may not be required at the point of submission. All the following criteria must be met for the stability data to be considered representative: The drug substance is manufactured using the same synthetic route and process. Scientific justification should be provided to demonstrate equivalence between the sites if differences exist; GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 101 of 170 The drug substance is controlled by the same set of specifications; The drug substance is packaged in the same container closure system; and The drug substance is of comparable quality to the drug substance used in the stability batches. If any of the above criteria are not met, site-specific stability data are required to support the application. In addition, a commitment to conduct stability studies for one production batch of drug substance is required for each site that is not represented in the submitted stability studies. Stability data from a site not proposed for registration may also be provided as supporting data. 18.3.2 Body of Data - Drug Product The ICH M4Q technical guideline and ACTR also provide details on the information to be included in the drug product sections of an application dossier. For drug product intermediates and diluents, separate drug product sections should be submitted. Pharmaceutical Development (CTD section 3.2.P.2) Detailed descriptions and discussions, with relevant data, which relate to the development, and hence quality, of the drug product should be provided in the relevant dossier sections. Examples include, but are not limited to: polymorphism, solubility or particle size of the drug substance and its effect on the product's quality; a description and the results of the formulation development; the rationale for the choice of dissolution method and a discussion of its discriminatory nature, with data; compatibility of the container closure system with the product or preservative efficacy test results; and optimisation of the manufacturing process, with data. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 102 of 170 Process Validation (CTD section 3.2.P.3.5) The description, documentation and complete results of the validation studies on the manufacturing process should be provided in the dossier in this section. Particular care should be taken to ensure that the documents include critical processes for the manufacturing process: for example, blend uniformity validation for oral dosage forms and terminal sterilisation or aseptic filling for sterile products. Applicants should refer to the ASEAN Guidelines on Submission of Manufacturing Process Validation Data for Drug Registration and the ASEAN Guideline on Process Validation Q&A for the minimum data requirements for process validation. Other relevant international guidelines may also be referred to as appropriate. Where ranges of batch sizes are proposed, it should be demonstrated that variations in batch size would not adversely alter the characteristics of the finished product. For drug product manufacturing sites that use parametric release (e.g. where a terminally sterilised product is released based on the review of manufacturing process data instead of sterility testing), a more detailed discussion with supporting data on the process validation of the specific product in the proposed pack size or fill volume should be provided. In addition, risk assessment for parametric release should be based on prior knowledge, consistency of performance of the steriliser, historical batch analysis data, risk of loading pattern/ container/ contamination from the environment to product sterility, re-processing plan and etc. A detailed discussion on the control strategy should also be provided. This includes but is not limited to, a tabulation of all validated critical process parameters and loading patterns, a description of the process and requirements for the release/rejection of a batch, bioburden monitoring and control program, the segregation of sterile products from non-sterile products and the routine maintenance/re-validation program for the steriliser. Control of Excipients (CTD section 3.2.P.4) This section refers to all excipients used in the drug product formulation, including ingredients used in capsule shells and film coatings. The specifications and GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 103 of 170 analytical method(s) for each excipient should be described, including the validation of any in-house test method(s) if applicable. Information on proprietary ingredients such as flavourings, colourants, coatings, perfumes and/or printing inks should be as detailed as possible. Applicants are advised not to use internal codes but instead to give commercial names for such ingredients. In cases where the formula of the proprietary ingredient is confidential, only the total quantity of the proprietary ingredient present in the final product needs to be captured in PRISM. The formula of the proprietary ingredient should then be provided by the proprietary ingredient manufacturer directly to HSA. A declaration letter from the proprietary ingredient manufacturer should also be provided, indicating that they will inform HSA (via email to HSA_TP_Enquiry@hsa.gov.sg ) should there be any change in the qualitative formulation of the proprietary ingredient. A CoA for an excipient may be submitted in lieu of the excipient's specifications. If the standard claimed for an excipient is an officially recognised compendial standard, it is sufficient to state that the excipient is tested according to the requirements of that standard, rather than reproducing the specifications found in the officially recognised compendial monograph. For excipients derived from animal sources, applicants should refer to Appendix 9 for more information. The checklist found in Annex 1 of Appendix 9 serves as a guide to these documentary requirements for submission. Applicants should note that the completed checklist in Annex 1 is to be submitted in CTD section 3.2.P.4.5 with the supporting documents submitted in ICH CTD section 3.2.A.2 or ACTD section Q.A.2. For milk and certain milk derivatives such as lactose, as these excipients are generally considered non-infectious, a declaration from the supplier of the excipient stating that the milk is from healthy cows fit for human consumption and that no other potentially infectious ruminant-derived materials were used in the manufacturing process would be sufficient. This declaration is to be submitted in CTD section 3.2.P.4.5. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 104 of 170 Control of Drug Product (CTD section 3.2.P.5) The drug product's release and shelf-life specifications should be declared in section 3.2.P.5.1. For the parametric release of a terminally sterilised product, the release specification and certificate of analysis should indicate that parametric release is the method used for batch release. Additionally, sterility of the product is required to be demonstrated in the stability studies even if approval for parametric release has been granted. Descriptions of all test methods with complete validation results of all in-house methods should be included in sections 3.2.P.5.2 and 3.2.P.5.3. Descriptions (including size, origin and use) and test results of all relevant batches (e.g. pre-clinical, clinical, pilot and production batches) used to establish the specification and evaluate the consistency in manufacturing should be provided. Batch analysis data and/or CoAs from three batches of the drug product should be provided in section 3.2.P.5.4. The justification of the specifications (section 3.2.P.5.6) should be based on scientific knowledge and data collected during product development. Container Closure System (CTD section 3.2.P.7) Technical information about each component of the container closure system(s) used for the drug product should be included in the dossier. The technical information to be included in the dossier includes, but is not limited to, schematic diagrams, descriptions, specifications, analytical methods, CoAs and declarations of compliance to international standards. Stability Data of Drug Product (CTD section 3.2.P.8) Since 01 April 2014, HSA has implemented the ASEAN Guideline on Stability Study of Drug Product , a guideline on the conduct of stability studies for drug products for GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 105 of 170 the ASEAN region. Applicants should familiarise themselves with this guideline prior to submission. At the time of submission of the application, the minimum stability data required are as follows: For critical dosage forms or unstable drug substances, at least 12 months of data under long term storage conditions and 6 months of data under accelerated storage conditions on at least three primary batches of the drug product For conventional dosage forms and stable drug substances, at least 6 months of data under long term storage conditions and 6 months of data under accelerated storage conditions on at least two primary batches of the drug product The primary batches should be at least of pilot scale, manufactured by the same manufacturing process and packaged in the same container closure system as that proposed for Singapore. Where multiple drug product manufacturers are proposed for registration, if it can be demonstrated that the submitted data is representative of the proposed sites, it may be acceptable to extrapolate the stability data from one site to the other sites, and stability data from each site may not be required at the point of submission. All the following criteria must be met for the stability data to be considered representative: The drug product is manufactured using the same formulation; The drug product is manufactured using the same manufacturing process, including equipment type, process parameters and in-process tests. Scientific justification should be provided to demonstrate equivalence between the sites if differences exist. The drug product is controlled by the same set of specifications; The drug product is packaged in the same container closure system; and The drug product is of comparable quality to the drug product used in the stability batches. If any of the above criteria are not met, site-specific stability data are required to support the application. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 106 of 170 In addition, a commitment to conduct stability studies for one production batch of drug product is required for each site that is not represented in the submitted stability studies. Stability data from a site not proposed for registration may also be provided as supporting data. Where possible, batches of drug product should be manufactured using different batches of drug substance. If multiple drug substance manufacturers are proposed for any of the drug substances in the drug product, a commitment to conduct drug product stability studies for one production batch using the drug substance from each drug substance manufacturer that is not represented in the drug product stability batches is required. If multiple primary packaging sites for the same container closure system are proposed for registration, transport validation of the bulk product to the other proposed primary packaging site(s) is required, unless otherwise justified. Product Interchangeability - Bioequivalence (CTD section 3.2.P.9.1) Since 01 April 2004, in vivo bioequivalence (BE) data are required for Prescription Only Medicines (POM) in oral solid dosage forms. GDA-2 applications will also require BE data if the application is for a POM in an oral solid dosage form, even if the first strength (GDA-1) application was submitted to HSA before 01 April 2004. Applicants should be familiar with Appendix 10 Product Interchangeability and Biowaiver Request for Chemical Generic Drug Applications . Applicants should ensure that the submitted BE study is complete, including all appendices and data, according to the relevant guidelines. Examples of information to be included in the report are: (a) Signature of the Principal Investigator to attest the authenticity of the report; (b) Audit certificate(s); GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 107 of 170 (c) BE site inspection report from a national regulatory agency or WHO, if available; (d) Approval letter(s) from the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee and the appropriate drug regulatory agency; (e) Information about the reference and test products, such as the product name, strength, dosage form, batch number, manufacturing site, batch size of the test product, etc.; (f) Certificates of Analysis of the reference and test products used in the BE study, including the batch size of the test product and manufacturing/expiry date of both products (where applicable); (g) Bioanalytical study report and description of the bioanalytical method validation; and (h) A signed statement confirming that the test product used in the BE study is the same formulation and is manufactured by the same process as that submitted for registration. Applicants should also provide a copy of the product labels (e.g. outer carton, product insert) of the reference product used in the BE study for verification purposes. It is highly recommended that the generic or test product used in the BE study be the same as the drug product submitted for registration in Singapore. If this cannot be fulfilled, then applicants should refer to Appendix 10 Product Interchangeability and Biowaiver Request for Chemical Generic Drug Applications for more information regarding eligibility and documentary requirements. In instances when the reference product used in the BE study is not the Singapore reference product, if the criteria listed in section 2 of Appendix 10 are fulfilled, then the following additional documents must be submitted in support of the application: (a) A comparative table that lists the qualitative composition of both the BE and Singapore reference products; (b) Comparative dissolution profiles between the BE and Singapore reference products; and (c) Comparative dissolution profiles between the BE test and Singapore reference products.

Applicants are reminded that generic products applied through the verification and verification-CECA evaluation routes must still demonstrate product interchangeability to the Singapore reference product. Data submitted to HSA must be the same as the data package submitted to the reference regulatory agencies. Differences between the dossier submitted to HSA and data reviewed by the reference drug regulatory agencies will not only delay the processing of the application, but may also lead to re-routing of the dossier to the abridged evaluation route if significant undisclosed differences are discovered. In addition, the BE test product must be manufactured at the same drug substance and drug product manufacturing sites by the same manufacturing processes as submitted in the GDA application dossier. 18.6 Documentary Requirements for Second Brand Registration of Chemical Therapeutic Products 18.6.1 Definition A second brand product refers to a chemical drug product which is identical to a registered (original) drug product in all aspects of quality, safety and efficacy at the time of its submission for market authorisation and is submitted by the same product registrant of the original drug product. 18.6.2 Documentary Requirements 18.6.2.1 Administrative A complete set of administrative documents as per section 18.1 Administrative documents has to be submitted. In addition, a declaration that the second brand product is identical to the original drug product in terms of quality, safety and efficacy is required. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 116 of 170 18.6.2.2 Quality A complete set of quality documents as per sections 18.2 CTD overview and summaries and 18.3 Quality documents has to be submitted. In addition, a comparative table of each CTD section between the second brand and original drug products is required and all differences between these two dossiers should be stated. The impact of these differences (if any) should generally be justified by the approval or submission of minor variation application - MIV (to state application number) to the original product dossier (see Chapter H - Minor Variation (MIV) Application Submission ). During the evaluation stage, if MIV has not been submitted for these differences to the original drug product dossier, then a MIV-2 application will be requested to update the original product dossier. A stop-clock will be imposed on the second brand product application until the update is completed. The product registrant is advised to file a MIV for the update of these differences prior to submission to avoid any delay in the review process of the second brand product. Submission of BE studies are generally not required for second brand product applications if the original product was granted marketing authorisation based on the evaluation of the product's quality, safety and efficacy. However if the original product was registered as a generic drug product before 01 April 2004, prior to the implementation of BE requirements, the current BE requirements will apply to the second brand product. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 117 of 170 CHAPTER E BIOSIMILAR PRODUCT APPLICATION SUBMISSION This chapter applies to new drug applications for biosimilar products. A biosimilar product is a biological therapeutic product demonstrated to be similar, in physicochemical characteristics, biological activity, safety and efficacy to an existing registered biological product. This chapter serves to provide guidance on the regulatory considerations of a biosimilar product, as well as the procedures and requirements for registration of a biosimilar product. Applicants are encouraged to refer to the relevant international guidelines e.g. EMA CHMP and WHO on biosimilar products. Alternative proposals to the recommended approach and requirements should be discussed with HSA and agreed upon in advance. HSA may consider such alternative proposals if substantiated by adequate scientific evidence and justifications, and may request for information or specify conditions not described in this document if deemed necessary to adequately assess the safety, efficacy and quality of the product. 19 APPLICATION TYPES Biosimilar products are eligible for the NDA-2 and NDA-3 application types. When selecting the Product Type in PRISM section 3.2, select ' Biological Drug '. NDA New Drug Application NDA-1: Not applicable to biosimilar products. NDA-2: For the first strength of a biosimilar product with the same dosage form, route of administration and presentation as the Singapore reference biological product (SRBP). GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 118 of 170 NDA-3: For subsequent strength(s) of a biosimilar product that has been registered or has been submitted as an NDA-2. The product name, dosage form, presentation, indication, dosing regimen and patient population should be the same as that for the NDA-2. 19.1 Biosimilar Product A biosimilar product is intended to be similar in terms of quality, safety and efficacy to a registered biological product. Due to the complexity of biological molecules which pose challenges in characterisation to demonstrate the similarity of the products, the registration of a biosimilar product should be based demonstration of similarity to the SRBP in quality, non-clinical and clinical parameters via comparability exercise. Demonstration of similarity of a biosimilar product to the SRBP in terms of quality is a prerequisite for determining the non-clinical and clinical data set required for registration. Significant differences between the biosimilar product and the SRBP detected during the comparability exercise would be an indication that the products are not similar and more extensive non-clinical and clinical data may be required to support the application for registration. If relevant differences are found in the quality, non-clinical, or clinical data, the product is unlikely to qualify as a biosimilar product. Comparability exercises to demonstrate similarity are more likely to be applied to highly purified products, which can be thoroughly characterised (such as some biotechnology-derived therapeutic products). Vaccines, blood or plasma-derived products are not eligible for registration via the biosimilar pathway. 19.2 Singapore Reference Biological Product The SRBP must be a currently registered therapeutic biological product registered in Singapore. A biosimilar product cannot be used as a reference product. The conditions of use for the biosimilar product must fall within the directions for use GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 119 of 170 including indication(s), dosing regimen(s) and patient group(s) of the SRBP. A biological product with no suitable SRBP will not qualify for registration as a biosimilar product in Singapore. The active ingredient of a biosimilar product must be similar, in molecular and biological terms, to the active ingredient of the SRBP. The pharmaceutical form, strength, and the route of administration of the biosimilar product should be the same as that of the SRBP. Any deviation from or differences between the biosimilar product and the SRBP will have to be justified by appropriate studies. Applicants are advised to search HSA's Register of Therapeutic Products to identify the SRBP. The SRBP should be used throughout the comparability assessment for quality, safety and efficacy studies during the development of a biosimilar product in order to allow for scientifically relevant and meaningful comparisons between the biosimilar and the SRBP. The comparability exercise for a biosimilar product is designed to show that the biosimilar product has highly similar quality attributes when compared to the SRBP. If the comparative studies are performed with a reference product from a non- Singapore registered manufacturing source, the manufacturer needs to demonstrate that the reference product used is comparable to the SRBP and hence suitable to support the application for marketing authorisation of a biosimilar product by providing an additional bridging study. The type of bridging data needed will typically include data from analytical studies (e.g. structural and functional data) that compare the proposed biosimilar product, the SRBP and the reference product used in the comparability studies, and may also include clinical PK and/or PD bridging studies data for all three products. All comparisons should meet the target acceptance criteria for analytical and PK/PD similarity. A final determination regarding the adequacy of the scientific justification and bridging data will be made during the evaluation of the application. 20 EVALUATION ROUTES A biosimilar product is eligible for the abridged or verification evaluation route. The product must have been approved by at least one of the following reference drug GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 120 of 170 regulatory agencies: EU EMA, Australia TGA, UK MHRA, US FDA and Health Canada. 20.1 Abridged Evaluation Route Abridged evaluation applies to a product that has been approved by at least one competent drug regulatory agency at the time of submission. A competent drug regulatory agency refers to a national regulatory authority participating in the World Health Organization's Certification Scheme on the Quality of Pharmaceutical Products Moving in International Commerce, and listed as such on the World Health Organization's website. 20.2 Verification Evaluation Route Therapeutic products with similar indication(s), dosing regimen(s), patient group(s), and/or direction(s) for use that have been approved by at least two of HSA's reference drug regulatory agencies may be eligible for submission via the verification evaluation route. HSA's reference drug regulatory agencies are: Australia Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA); Health Canada (HC); US Food and Drug Administration (FDA); European Medicines Agency (EMA) via the Centralised Procedure; and UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (UK MHRA) via \u00ad the national procedure, or \u00ad as the Reference Member State (RMS) via the Mutual Recognition Procedure or Decentralised Procedure on or prior to 31 January 2020 when the UK has formally left the European Union. However, approval by these reference drug regulatory agencies does not oblige HSA to approve the application. HSA may also re-categorise applications to other evaluation routes if the applications did not meet the eligibility criteria and/or submission requirements. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 121 of 170 The applicant must confirm one of the reference drug regulatory agencies as the primary reference agency. The chosen primary reference agency is defined as the reference drug regulatory agency from which the qualifying supporting documents (as outlined in this guidance) will be submitted. The pre-requisite requirements for the verification route include: The product has received full marketing approval by the reference agencies following a complete independent scientific assessment (i.e. the approval is not granted on the basis of less comprehensive data than normally would require or subject to post-approval conditions that require submission of additional data to confirm the product's benefit-risk profile); The application must be submitted to HSA within three years from the date of approval by the chosen primary reference agency; A declaration letter issued by the product owner/applicant must be provided stating that all aspects of the drug product's quality, including but not limited to the formulation, manufacturing site(s), release and shelf life specifications and primary packaging, are identical to that currently approved by the chosen primary reference agency at the time of submission. However, a different container closure system type (e.g. Alu/Alu blister vs. HDPE bottle) may be proposed to meet ASEAN stability requirements; The product does not need independent assessment by HSA to contextualise the benefit-risk profile due to local disease epidemiology, medical practice and/or public health considerations. Examples of products that may require such contextualised assessment are anti-infectives, vaccines etc; and The product and its intended use - i.e. indication(s), dosing regimen(s) and patient group(s) - have not been rejected, withdrawn, or approved via appeal process or are not pending deferral by a drug regulatory agency for safety and/or efficacy reasons. 20.2.1 NDA-3 Applications For the NDA-3 application type, the verification evaluation route may be applied to the registration of subsequent strengths of a currently-registered product in Singapore. To qualify for the verification evaluation route for an NDA-3 application: GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 122 of 170 if the product has been evaluated and approved by at least one of HSA's reference drug regulatory agencies, then the NDA-3 must be submitted within two years from the date of approval by that reference drug regulatory agency; or if the product has been evaluated and approved by at least two of HSA's reference drug regulatory agencies, then the NDA-3 must be submitted within three years from the date of approval by the chosen primary reference agency. All other eligibility criteria for the verification evaluation route as stated in section 20.2 above will apply to NDA-3 applications except for the following: The proposed indication(s), dosing regimen(s), patient group(s), and/or direction(s) for use must be identical to the corresponding approved product; and The proposed PI/PIL should also be consistent with that currently approved for the corresponding NDA-2 product. 21 DOCUMENTARY REQUIREMENTS Table 9 outlines the CTD Modules/Parts required for NDAs submitted for registration of a biosimilar product.

The SRBP used in the biosimilar product comparability exercise at the quality level must be clearly identified (e.g. brand name, pharmaceutical form, cell substrate, formulation, strength, manufacturing site of the reference medicinal product, number of batches, lot number, age of batches used). Comparability data between the biosimilar product and the SRBP (in terms of quality) must be included in the quality dossier. The extent of the comparability studies and the assessment criteria should take into consideration: the complexity of the molecular structure; the capability of the methods used to demonstrate comparability; and their impact on quality, safety and efficacy. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 124 of 170 For the development of a biosimilar product, the quality target product profile (QTPP) should be established based on the data obtained from extensive characterisation of the SRBP in order to relate the biosimilar product to the SRBP in terms of molecular characteristics and quality attributes. This QTPP should be considered as a development tool through which some target ranges may evolve during development, as further information on the SRBP becomes available. For robust comparability analysis, a representative quality profile of the SRBP should be generated from multiple different batches of the SRBP when establishing the QTPP for the biosimilar product. Quantitative ranges should be established for the biosimilar comparability exercise based primarily on the measured quality attribute ranges of the SRBP and should not be wider than the range of variability of the representative SRBP batches, unless otherwise justified. An extensive comparability exercise is essential to demonstrate that the biosimilar product has a highly similar quality profile when compared to the SRBP. The manufacturer must carefully design the comparability exercise based upon full knowledge of the molecular structure and its relevance to the mode of action. The result is a series of physicochemical tests, along or in combination with such biological tests as in vitro and in vivo bioassays, and receptor binding studies. These analyses should include side-by-side comparative studies to demonstrate the similarities and differences between the biosimilar product and the SRBP. Where comparability testing cannot establish similarity or where differences arise, the differences detected in the quality attributes will have to be appropriately justified with respect to their potential impact on safety and efficacy. Extensive characterisation studies should be applied to the biosimilar and SRBP in parallel, to demonstrate with a high level of assurance that the quality of the biosimilar product is comparable to the SRBP. Methods used in the characterisation studies form an integral part of the quality data package. The selected methods should be appropriately qualified for the purpose of comparability and demonstrate that the methods are of acceptable sensitivity and capable to detect slight GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 125 of 170 differences in all aspects pertinent to the evaluation of quality (e.g. ability to detect relevant variants with high sensitivity). For process changes that may occur during the development of the biosimilar product, comparability exercise(s) for such process changes should be clearly identified and addressed separately from the comparability exercise performed against the SRBP. It is strongly recommended to generate the required quality, safety and efficacy data using the test product manufactured with the final manufacturing process (representing the quality profile of the batches to be commercialised) for the demonstration of biosimilarity against the SRBP. 21.4 Non-clinical and Clinical Documents Non-clinical and clinical data generated with the biosimilar product are required. The amount of non-clinical and clinical data required will depend on: the product or class of products; the extent of characterisation which is possible to undertake when using state- of-the-art analytical methods; observed or potential differences between the biosimilar product and the SRBP; and the clinical experience with the product class. A case-by-case approach is needed for each class of products. Submission of RMPs in support of all biosimilar applications is mandatory. Guidance on risk management plan submission can be found in Appendix 16 Guideline on the Submission of Risk Management Plan Documents . A statement that the product is a biosimilar medicinal product should be included in the package insert. 21.4.1 Non-clinical Documentation GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 126 of 170 Before initiating clinical development, non-clinical studies should be performed. These studies should be comparative in nature and should be designed to detect differences in response between the biosimilar product and the SRBP. Available product specific guidelines and relevant international guidelines should be referred to in the design of an appropriate non-clinical study programme. The requirements for the non-clinical documentation include: In vitro studies: Assays such as receptor-binding studies or cell-based assays should normally be undertaken to establish comparability in reactivity and the likely causative factor(s) if comparability cannot be established; and Animal studies should be performed to investigate the pharmacodynamic effects/ activities relevant to the clinical application, non-clinical toxicity as determined in at least one repeat dose toxicity study, including toxicokinetic measurements, and specific safety concerns. Generally, other toxicological studies to investigated safety pharmacology, reproduction toxicology, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity are not required for biosimilar products, unless the observed differences between the biosimilar product and SRBP warrants further study. 21.4.2 Clinical Documentation The requirements for clinical data will depend on the existing knowledge of the SRBP and the claimed therapeutic indication(s). In addition to international guidelines on biosimilar products, relevant disease specific guidelines should be referred to in the design of an appropriate clinical study programme. The clinical data for the comparability study should be generated with the test product produced with the final manufacturing process and therefore representing the quality profile of the batches to be commercialised. Any deviation from this is to be justified and supported by adequate bridging data. The type of bridging data needed will typically include comparability data from analytical studies (e.g. structural and functional data) and may also include clinical PK and/or PD comparability data. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 127 of 170 The clinical comparability exercise should begin with PK and PD studies followed by clinical efficacy and safety studies. It is a prerequisite to perform comparative PK studies designed to demonstrate clinical comparability between the biosimilar product and the SRBP with respect to the key PK parameters. PD parameters are to be studied whenever feasible and the PD markers should be selected based on their clinical relevance. Generally, comparative clinical studies are required for the demonstration of clinical comparability. In certain cases, comparative PK/PD studies between the biosimilar product and the SRBP may be sufficient to demonstrate clinical comparability, provided that all the following conditions are met: The PK profile of the SRBP is well characterised; There is sufficient knowledge of the PD properties of the SRBP, including the binding to its target receptor(s) and intrinsic activity. There may be instances where the mechanism of action of the biological product is disease-specific. A relevant PD endpoint can be used when it is an established surrogate of efficacy or when it can be linked to the mechanism of action of the product; and The relationship between dose/exposure and response/efficacy of the SRBP is sufficiently characterised. For comparative clinical studies to demonstrate clinical comparability between the biosimilar product and the SRBP, clinical comparability margins should be pre- specified and adequately justified. The most sensitive clinical model should be used to detect potential differences between the biosimilar product and the SRBP. In cases where the SRBP has more than one indication, the efficacy and safety of the biosimilar product has to be justified, or demonstrated separately for each of the claimed indications. In certain instances, it may be possible to extrapolate therapeutic similarity shown in one indication to other indications of the SRBP. Justification of extrapolation to other indications will depend on various factors, which may include the sensitivity of the clinical study population, clinical experience, available literature data, mechanisms of action, target receptors, pattern of molecular signalling upon binding to the receptor, PK in different patient GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 128 of 170 populations, PD parameters, patient-related factors, etc. Possible safety issues in different subpopulations should also be addressed. Immunogenicity Immunogenic responses may develop in patients who are treated with biological products, including biosimilars. The development of antibodies in some instances is a benign effect causing few, if any, undesirable symptoms in patients receiving therapy. On the other hand, the induced antibodies may be associated with undesirable consequences, which manifest themselves as mild to severe anaphylactoid reactions. Efficacy may also be diminished by the presence of neutralising antibodies or binding antibodies, which may affect PK. Therefore, the immunogenicity of a biosimilar product must be investigated. Animal studies may not be able to predict immunogenicity of a biological product, particularly the more complex proteins as immunogenic response is species- dependent. The assessment of immunogenicity requires an optimal antibody testing strategy, characterisation of the observed immune response, as well as evaluation of the correlation between antibodies and PK or PD, and the impact of antibodies on clinical safety and efficacy. It is also important to consider the risk of immunogenicity in different therapeutic indications separately. The extent of independent testing needed depends on various factors such as the indication, whether the product is to be administered chronically, the overall assessment of the product's immunogenic potential, and whether there is the possibility of generating a cross-reaction with an important endogenous molecule. 21.5 Documentary Requirements for Each Evaluation Route 21.5.1 Abridged Evaluation Route The technical documents required include: complete quality documents for both drug substance and drug product including comparability studies; non-clinical documents including comparability studies; and GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 129 of 170 clinical documents including comparability studies 21.5.2 Verification Evaluation Route The complete assessment report and other relevant supporting documents from the chosen primary reference agency must be submitted, as tabulated below.

GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 135 of 170 CHAPTER F POST-APPROVAL PROCESS Changes to a product registration throughout its life cycle must be submitted to HSA via a variation application. These include administrative/editorial, quality and clinical/non-clinical changes. In general, once the application has been approved/processed, the changes should be implemented by the next importation, or when logistically feasible. 22 APPLICATION TYPES There are two types of variation applications - major variation applications (MAV) and minor variation applications (MIV). MAV Major Variation application for an existing registered product MAV-1: Any variation to the approved indication(s), route(s) of administration, dosing regimen(s), patient group(s), and/or inclusion of clinical information extending the usage of the product (e.g. clinical trial information related to an unapproved indication, dosing regimen and/or patient population; additional bacterial strains with clinical ( in vivo) data to expand the indication(s) for antimicrobial products; additional viral serotypes/genotypes to expand the indication(s) for antiviral products, etc.). MAV-2: A change in the current approved forensic classification, also known as reclassification. MIV Minor Variation application for an existing registered product GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 136 of 170 MIV-1 A minor variation that Is specified under Part A: Checklist on Dossier Requirements for MIV-1 variations of Appendix 13 (Chemicals) or Appendix 14 (Biologics). Requires prior approval before the change(s) can be implemented. MIV-2 (Notification) A minor variation that Is specified under Part B: Checklist on Dossier Requirements for MIV-2 (Notification) Variation of Appendix 13 (Chemicals) or Appendix 14 (Biologics); May be implemented within 40 days upon application submission if there are no objections raised by HSA. MIV-2 (Do-and-Tell) A minor variation that Is specified under Part C: Checklist on Dossier Requirements for MIV-2 (Do-and-Tell) Variation of Appendix 13 (Chemicals) or Appendix 14 (Biologics); Does not require prior approval, but must be submitted to HSA within 6 months following implementation of the specified changes. [Refer to Chapter H, 27.2.2 for more information] HSA may re-categorise the application type if appropriate (e.g. MIV to MAV-1, MIV- 2 to MIV-1, or vice versa ). Applicants will be notified if they are required to withdraw and resubmit the application according to the correct category. Please refer to Chapters G and H for more information on MAV and MIV respectively.

In the event that applicants are still unable to determine the type of variation, the MIV Enquiry Form may be submitted. Figure 5 Schematic Diagram of the Variation Application Process. PRE-SUBMISSION PREPARATION APPLICATION SUBMISSION APPLICATION SCREENING (For MAV-1 and MAV-2 only) APPLICATION EVALUATION REGULATORY DECISION (for MAV and MIV-1 only) NON-ACCEPTANCE / WITHDRAWAL ACCEPTANCE NON-APPROVAL / WITHDRAWAL GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 138 of 170 For more information on TPB's pre-submission consultation mechanisms, refer to the website: Pre-submission Consultation Mechanisms 23.1.1 Pre-Submission Notification A pre-submission meeting is not compulsory for making an application to HSA. (see section 24.1 Evaluation Routes for more information on MAV-1 evaluation routes). Nonetheless, the applicant is required to notify HSA at least two months prior to the intended submission date for applications submitted via the full evaluation route. The notification should include information on the product name (if available), active ingredient(s), summaries of the clinical data (e.g. Overviews), planned submissions in other countries, and planned date of submission to HSA. 23.2 Application Submission The submission of an application comprises two key steps - (i) online submission of the application form via PRISM and (ii) submission of the technical dossier. 23.2.1 PRISM Application Form Applicants should refer to Appendix 17 Guideline on PRISM Submission for further details. 23.2.2 Variation Application Dossier The technical dossier accompanying the application should be submitted within 2 working days of the PRISM application submission to prevent delays in the processing of the application. The date of receipt of the actual technical dossier by HSA will be taken as the submission date where the processing time starts. The dossier submitted for variation applications should be in the same CTD format as that used for the original new product application. Application checklists for both ICH CTD and ACTD dossiers are provided in Appendix 2B and 3B, respectively, to guide applicants on the submission requirements and to ensure completeness of the dossier. Each MAV application GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 139 of 170 must be accompanied by a checklist duly completed by the applicant and attached in PRISM. 23.2.2.1 Submission Requirements The complete application dossier - i.e. Modules 1 to 5 of the ICH CTD or Parts I to IV of the ACTD - must be submitted in an electronic format. All documents required under Module 1/Part I must be submitted in softcopy in PRISM. Colour scanned copy of the original documents should be submitted and original hardcopy of documents are not required. However, HSA reserves the right to request for the submission of the original or certified true copy of the submitted document if there is any doubt that the submitted scanned document is not an accurate reflection of the original document. Please refer to section 23.2.2.3 for more information on certifying non-original documents if the original documents cannot be provided. For Modules 2 to 5/Parts II to IV, applicants can opt to attach the documents either in full into PRISM section 7 (Supporting Attachments) or submit the softcopies (e.g. PDF format) in a CD/DVD. For submission requirements for MIV applications, please refer to Appendix 13 and Appendix 14 for registered chemical products and registered biological products, respectively. Submitting a CD or DVD When submitting a CD/DVD, applicants are encouraged to organise the dossier (i.e. folders and subfolders) according to the CTD format and to include bookmarks in all documents to facilitate retrieval of documents. Files containing the below scripts will not be accepted due to cybersecurity reasons: GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 140 of 170 As a general guide, folder or file names should not be named with \"xxx .P (e.g. \"3.2.P\"). The CD/DVD should be properly labelled or accompanied by a letter with the following information: PRISM application number; PRISM submission date; Product name; Application Contents of the CD/DVD (e.g. Module 2 and 5); and Applicant's email address. Upon receipt of the CD/DVD, HSA will issue an acknowledgement email to the applicant via the email address provided with the CD/DVD submission. Applicants must ensure the access to the content of CD/DVD. For protected files, password(s) must be provided as appropriate. Upon acceptance of the application for evaluation, applicants will be notified if additional copies of clinical documents (in CD/DVD) will be required. Note: We are unable to accept submission of dossier via any digital portable devices (e.g. flash memory sticks). GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 141 of 170 23.2.2.2 Language and Translation All documents submitted in support of an application to HSA must be in English. For documents in original language which is not English, a certified translation or a verified translation may be acceptable. Translation type Type of Documents Requirements Certified Translation Official certificates issued by the drug regulatory agency of a country Proof of approval issued by the drug regulatory agency of a country Notarisation & Authentication (10) Notarisation These documents must be notarised by a notary public in country where document is issued. Details of particulars to be included by notary: (i) The name of the notary; (ii) A statement that the notary is duly admitted to practice in the place of issue of the certificate; (iii) The names of the signatories and the capacity in which they have executed the document, whether on their own behalf or in an official or representative capacity; (iv) A statement authenticating the signatures of the parties and, where appropriate, indicating that evidence has been produced to the notary proving the capacity in which they have executed the document; (v) The place and date of issue of the notarial certificate; and (vi) The signature and seal of the notary. (10) Authentication GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 142 of 170 These documents must be authenticated (i.e. the origin of the document is attested to) by one of the following government bodies: (i) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the country in which the document was issued; or (ii) The Singapore Embassy/Consulate in the country where the document was issued. Applicants are advised to consult the Singapore Embassy/Consulate in the country where the document originated regarding the local requirements for document legalisation, as these may deviate from the process as outlined in the preceding paragraph. Verified Translation Technical documents (e.g. package insert, submission dataset) Verification Document A verification document must be provided by the translator of the document into the English language. The verification document must state that the translation into English is accurate . Details of particulars to be included in verification document: (i) the name of translator; (ii) a statement that he/she is well versed in English and the relevant foreign language; and (iii) a reference to the document being translated. Refer to the sample verification document for translator enclosed in Appendix 4. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 143 of 170 With Singapore acceding to the Apostillle Convention on 16 September 2021, for certified translated document issued by a country which acceded to the Apostille Convention, an apostille certificate can be submitted in lieu of a notarised/authenticated certified translation. 23.2.2.3 Certifying non-original documents If the softcopy official document (e.g. CPP, GMP certificate, etc.) submitted to HSA in PRISM is not a scan of the original document, the document must be certified prior to submission. A certified true copy certifies that the photocopy presented is a true and accurate copy of the original document. Acceptable certification of documents to support drug product applications to HSA can be done by the Company Director or Company Secretary as registered with ACRA or above, or by an independent authority such as a lawyer, notary public, Commissioner for Oaths/Declarations/Affidavits, Justice of Peace, the original issuer of the document or Embassy/Consulate. A notarised and authenticated copy is the same as a certified true copy. A certified true copy of approval letters requires certification by the drug regulatory agency that issued the approval letter, notary public or Singapore Embassy/Consulate in the country where the approval letter was issued. Certification of approval letters is not required in the event the approval letter is available on the drug regulatory agency's website. In this instance, applicants should provide the internet address (URL) for validation by HSA. 23.3 Application Screening MAV-1 and MAV-2 applications will be screened to ensure the correctness of the application type and the completeness of the dossier. The date of receipt of the application dossier (i.e. the technical dossier [e.g. in a CD/DVD] including the application checklist) will be taken as the submission date and the start of the screening timeline. If an application is identified to be more appropriately submitted under a different application type, the applicant will be informed of this change and the necessary GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 144 of 170 actions to effect this change via an Input Request. More information on the change in application type is described in section 23.6.2.1 Changes to Application Types and Re-routing of Evaluation During Screening . An MAV application submitted without the clinical dossier or an application submitted via the verification route without assessment reports will not be screened, An Input Request will be issued to the applicant to withdraw the application. Applicants are also advised to ensure that the dossier is compiled according to the required format. Failure to adhere to the required CTD format will lead to the non- acceptance of the dossier without screening. If the dossier submitted is considered to be incomplete, a screening query stating the deficiencies will be issued via PRISM (Input Request) to the applicant. The stop- clock starts when an Input Request is sent and ends upon receipt of a complete and satisfactory response to the query. For MAV applications, the total number of Input Requests sent during screening is capped at two. Applicants will be given 20 working days to respond to each Input Request, starting from the date the Input Request is sent. The application will only be accepted when all deficiencies have been adequately addressed and HSA is satisfied that the dossier is complete for evaluation. An acceptance notice will then be issued via PRISM and the date of acceptance of the application will be taken as the start of the evaluation timeline. If the applicant fails to address the deficiencies raised during screening, the dossier is considered incomplete for evaluation. An Input Request will be issued to the applicant to withdraw the application. If the application is subsequently re- submitted, it will be processed as a new application. NOTE : The screening process only checks for completeness of the application dossier for evaluation. The acceptance of the dossier for evaluation does not denote the adequacy of the data for regulatory approval. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 145 of 170 For MIV-1 applications, applicants will receive an \"Acceptance\" notification sent within 3 working days after submission of an MIV-1 application via PRISM. For applications submitted under an incorrect application type (e.g. MAV-1 changes submitted as a MIV-1), applicants will be requested to withdraw the application during evaluation. 23.4 Application Evaluation and Regulatory Decision Once the application is accepted, the evaluation stage begins. Evaluation queries may be issued via Input Request to the applicant if clarification or additional information is required. The stop-clock starts whenever HSA issues a query and ends upon the receipt of a complete and satisfactory response from the applicant. In situations where the applicant is unable to provide a complete response within the specified timeframe, the applicant should notify HSA as soon as possible after receiving HSA's queries. The application will be considered withdrawn if the applicant fails to observe the specified response deadline. Applicants are reminded that the submission of additional supporting data not requested by HSA following the acceptance of the application will not be considered, unless prior arrangement with HSA is made for the submission concerned. During the evaluation process, HSA may assess that the application is more suitably evaluated via an alternative route, in which case the application will be re-routed to the appropriate route. Any re-routing of the application will be discussed with the applicant. HSA may engage external evaluators, experts and advisory committees in the evaluation process, when necessary. These experts include scientists and clinicians from both local and overseas institutions. All external evaluators and experts are bound by agreement to protect the information made available to them. The identity of the external evaluators is kept confidential. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 146 of 170 For MAV-1 applications (full and abridged evaluation routes), applicants can check on the progress of the evaluation and may view the evaluation stage via Track@PRISM .

Payment can be made via GIRO or other electronic payment modes such as eNets or eCredit card. Regardless of payment mode selection, the collection of both screening and evaluation fee for applications submitted via the full evaluation route occurs upon issuance of the screening outcome. 23.6.1 Screening Fee The screening fee is only applicable for MAV-1 applications and is payable at the time of online submission via PRISM. The screening fee is non-refundable once the application is submitted via PRISM. For payment via GIRO, the screening fee will be debited upon the successful submission of an online application. For payment via other electronic payment modes (i.e. eNets or eCredit card), the screening fee must be paid before the application is considered successfully submitted online. A screening fee is not applicable for other types of variation applications. NOTE: Applicants are strongly encouraged to apply for a GIRO account ( click here for GIRO application form) with HSA to facilitate payments for future submissions and subsequent payment for retention fee for the registered products. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 149 of 170 23.6.2 Evaluation Fee There are two different evaluation fees for MAV-1 applications: (a) Evaluation fees for a single-strength product or the first product in a series of products of different strengths; and (b) Evaluation fees for each subsequent product in a series of products of different strengths. An evaluation fee for a MAV-1 application is payable upon the acceptance of the dossier for evaluation and is non-refundable once the application is accepted. An evaluation fee for a MIV-1 application is payable upon the submission of the application in PRISM and is non-refundable. For payments via GIRO, the evaluation fee will be debited upon the acceptance of the application. For payments via other electronic payment modes (i.e. eNets or eCredit card), the evaluation fee will be collected together with the screening fee. In the event that the application is not accepted for evaluation, the fee collected will be refunded to the applicant's bank account. Applicants may opt for the progressive payment scheme. This is an opt-in scheme eligible for applicants who make payment via GIRO and is only applicable to the application types listed in Table 11: Table 11 Variation Applications Applicable for Progressive Payment Scheme Percentage of Evaluation Fee Payable at Each Stage Application Type Evaluation Route Evaluation Status Acceptance for Evaluation Active Evaluation in Progress Evaluation at Midway Completed Evaluation MAV-1 Full or 30% 40% 20% 10% GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 150 of 170 Abridged Once the application is submitted, the selected payment scheme (full or progressive) cannot be amended. Applicants who wish to change their selected payment scheme will have to withdraw and re-submit the application(s); and any upfront payment made (e.g. screening fee) are non-refundable. For applications under the progressive payment scheme, in the event that the application is withdrawn during the evaluation stage, any fees that had been charged, but not debited from the GIRO account would remain payable. Any paid fee is non-refundable. 23.6.2.1 Changes to Application Types and Re-routing of Evaluation During Screening If an application type or evaluation route is incorrectly selected, applicants will be informed via an Input Request. Such changes may result in a different evaluation fee upon acceptance of the application. In the situation where the applicant decides not to pursue the application due to the said changes, the screening fee is not refundable. For applications which require withdrawal and resubmission, the screening fee is not refundable. 23.6.2.2 Change of Application between Different Application Types This refers to a change in the application type between MAV-1, MAV-2, MIV-1 or MIV-2. The applicant will be required to withdraw and resubmit the application if the applicant intends to pursue the application. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 151 of 170 23.6.2.3 Change of Evaluation Route This refers to a change in evaluation route (e.g. Full to Abridged, Verification to Abridged, Abridged to Verification, etc.). The applicant will be required to withdraw and resubmit the application if the applicant intends to pursue the application. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 152 of 170 CHAPTER G MAJOR VARIATION (MAV) APPLICATION SUBMISSION This chapter applies to major variation applications for currently registered products. 24 MAV-1 APPLICATIONS An MAV-1 application applies to variations to any of the following: (a) approved indication(s); (b) approved route(s) of administration; (c) approved dosing regimen(s); (d) approved patient group(s); and/or (e) inclusion of clinical information extending the usage of the product - for example, clinical trial information related to an unapproved indication, dosing regimen and/or patient population; additional bacterial strains with clinical ( in vivo) data to expand the indication(s) for antimicrobial products; additional viral serotypes/genotypes to expand the indication(s) for antiviral products, etc. For each product registration, applicants may submit up to a maximum of three concurrent MAV-1 applications at any one time. 24.1 Evaluation Routes There are three evaluation routes for an MAV-1 - full, abridged and verification. The eligibility criteria and documentary requirements are different for each evaluation route. Approved by HSA's reference agencies and meets verification criteria? Is the major variation approved by any drug regulatory agency? NO FULL ROUTE ABRIDGED ROUTE YES NO YES VERIFICATION ROUTE MAV-1 Figure 5 Schematic Diagram of Evaluation Routes for MAV-1s GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 153 of 170 24.1.1 Full Evaluation Route Full evaluation will apply to a major variation that has not been approved by any drug regulatory agency at the time of submission. For a submission under the full evaluation route, the applicant is required to notify HSA at least two months prior to the intended submission date of the application dossier. The notification should include information on the product name (if available), active ingredient(s), summaries of the quality, non-clinical and clinical data (e.g. Overviews), planned submissions in other countries, and the planned date of submission to HSA. 24.1.2 Abridged Evaluation Route Abridged evaluation applies to a major variation that has been evaluated and approved by at least one competent drug regulatory agency. The proposed variation - i.e. the proposed indication(s), route(s) of administration, dosing regimen(s), patient group(s) and/or clinical information - should be the same as that approved by the regulatory agency that issued the proof of approval. A competent drug regulatory agency refers to a national regulatory authority participating in the World Health Organization's Certification Scheme on the Quality of Pharmaceutical Products Moving in International Commerce, and listed as such on the World Health Organization's website. 24.1.3 Verification Evaluation Route A major variation that has been approved by at least two of HSA's reference drug regulatory agencies may be eligible for submission via the verification evaluation route. HSA's reference drug regulatory agencies are: Australia Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA); Health Canada (HC); US Food and Drug Administration (FDA); European Medicines Agency (EMA) via the Centralised Procedure; and UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (UK MHRA) via GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 154 of 170 \u00ad the national procedure, or \u00ad as the Reference Member State (RMS) via the Mutual Recognition Procedure or Decentralised Procedure on or prior to 31 January 2020 when the UK has formally left the European Union. However, approval by these reference drug regulatory agencies does not oblige HSA to approve the application. HSA may also re-categorise applications to other evaluation routes if the applications did not meet the eligibility criteria and/or submission requirements. The applicant must confirm one of the reference drug regulatory agencies as the primary reference agency. The chosen primary reference agency is defined as the reference drug regulatory agency from which the qualifying supporting documents (as outlined in this guidance) will be submitted and which approved the strictest indication(s), route(s) of administration, dosing regimen(s), patient groups(s) and/or direction(s) for use among the reference drug regulatory agencies which approved the variation. The pre-requisite requirements for the verification route include: The product has received full marketing approval by the reference agencies following a complete independent scientific assessment (i.e. the approval is not granted on the basis of less comprehensive data than normally would require or subject to post-approval conditions that require submission of additional data to confirm the product's benefit-risk profile); The application must be submitted within three years from the date of approval by the chosen primary reference agency; The product does not need independent assessment by HSA to contextualise the benefit-risk profile due to local disease epidemiology, medical practice and/or public health considerations. Examples of products that may require such contextualised assessment are anti-infectives, vaccines etc.; and The product and its intended use - i.e. indication(s), route(s) of administration, dosing regimen(s) and patient group(s) - have not been rejected, withdrawn, approved via appeal process or pending deferral by a drug regulatory agency for safety and/or efficacy reasons.

Differences between the dossier submitted to HSA and data reviewed by the reference drug regulatory agencies will not only delay the processing of the application but may also lead to the re-routing of the dossier to the abridged evaluation route if significant undisclosed differences are discovered. 25 MAV-2 APPLICATIONS An MAV-2 application applies to variations involving a change in forensic classification of a registered product, otherwise known as \"reclassification\". Examples of reclassification include from POM to P or from P to GSL. Applicants are advised to refer to section 1.2 Forensic classification for more information. Reclassification may also be undertaken when experience gained shows that there is a need to supervise the use of a product - i.e. from GSL to P or POM. More information on reclassified medicines may be found on the HSA website . 25.1 Evaluation Routes Only the abridged evaluation route applies for MAV-2 applications. 25.2 Eligibility Criteria A change of forensic classification of a POM or P drug product to a less stringent classification may be considered if the following criteria are met: (a) The use of the product has been sufficiently extensive; (b) The product has been marketed for a period of time sufficient to establish a post- marketing adverse event profile; (c) The product's safety profile gives no cause for concern during the marketing period; and GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 162 of 170 (d) The product is presented in an appropriate pack size with consumer-friendly labelling (PIL/outer carton).

The documentary requirements for an MAV-2 submission include: (a) Section 1.1 - Comprehensive Table of Contents; (b) Section 1.2 - Cover Letter- including the justification for reclassification, as listed above, and the Table of Amendment Details of PRISM section 0.5; (c) Section 1.4 - Product Labels - the proposed product labels/PIL should also be submitted, if applicable; (d) Section 1.5 - Approved SPC/PI/PIL; (e) Section 1.8 - Proof of Approval - proof of the approved indication(s) and dosing regimen(s) for the reclassified product in the UK, US, Canada and/or Australia; GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 163 of 170 (f) Section 1.15 - Registration Status in Other Countries; and, (g) Module 2/Part IV - Summary of Clinical Safety - the summary should include the following: (i) The forensic classification of the product in the UK, US, Canada and Australia, with specific information on its forensic classification and duration of sale in that classification; (ii) The experience of patient exposure to the product - e.g. sales volume, patient-years; (iii) A summary of the product safety profile based on worldwide and local spontaneous adverse drug reaction reports, post-marketing surveillance data, clinical trials and published literature; (iv) A list of the potential problems arising from using the product without medical supervision; and (v) An analysis of the hazards arising from therapeutic misuse or drug abuse, whether deliberate or accidental e.g. consequence of delay in seeking medical attention. 25.4 'Me-too' Reclassification A me-too MAV-2 application may be submitted if it is riding on a previous forensic classification of an analogous product. The documentary requirements include: (a) Section 1.1 - Comprehensive Table of Contents; (b) Section 1.2 - Cover Letter- including the justification for reclassification, and the Table of Amendment Details of PRISM section 0.5; (c) Section 1.4 - Product Labels - the proposed product labels/PIL should also be submitted, if applicable; and (d) Section 1.5 - Approved SPC/PI/PIL, if applicable. The Summary of Clinical Safety in Module 2/Part IV is not required. CHAPTER H MINOR VARIATION (MIV) APPLICATION SUBMISSION This chapter applies to minor variation applications for currently registered products. 26 APPLICATION TYPES There are two types of minor variation applications - MIV-1 and MIV-2: MIV-1: A minor variation that Is specified under Part A: Checklist on Dossier Requirements for MIV-1 variations of Appendix 13 (Chemicals) or Appendix 14 (Biologics); Requires prior approval before the change(s) can be implemented. MIV-2 (Notification) A minor variation that Is specified under Part B: Checklist on Dossier Requirements for MIV-2 (Notification) Variation of Appendix 13 (Chemicals) or Appendix 14 (Biologics); May be implemented within 40 days upon application submission if there are no objections raised by HSA. MIV-2 (Do-and-Tell) A minor variation that Is specified under Part C: Checklist on Dossier Requirements for MIV-2 (Do-and-Tell) Variation of Appendix 13 (Chemicals) or Appendix 14 (Biologics); Does not require prior approval, but must be submitted to HSA within 6 months following implementation of the specified changes. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 165 of 170 27 APPLICATION SUBMISSION Applicants should be familiar with the guidelines and documentary requirements described in Appendix 13 (chemical) and Appendix 14 (biologics) before submitting minor variation applications. The appropriate variation may be selected with the aid of this MIV self-guided tool (Appendix 12). Any undisclosed variation(s) embedded in the submitted data, including any follow- on changes, will not be considered. Evaluation will be based on the data relevant to the proposed variation(s) unless HSA specifically requests for additional information. For applications where there are proposed changes to the product labels: (i) Both the proposed and currently approved Singapore product labels and PI/PIL are required. (ii) For the proposed labelling/PI/PIL, a pristine and an annotated version (which highlights the changes made to the currently approved labelling) are required. (iii) Annotations should be made on the current approved labelling materials based on the actual text to be added. (iv) Current approved text proposed for deletion should be struck through, whereas newly added and proposed text should be underlined or highlighted. (v) Current approved text that is not intended to be deleted should not be annotated. (vi) Proposed changes to all labels must be clearly annotated, and the final approved changes would be as annotated in the final label submitted in PRISM. Applicants are strongly encouraged to submit variation applications for multiple strengths of the same therapeutic product at the same time. Applicants should also indicate in the PRISM application form and cover letter if the proposed change(s) GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 166 of 170 affect multiple products and if there are other pending variation (MAV/MIV) applications for the same therapeutic product. Suggested guidance for further reading: Appendix 5 Target Processing Timeline Appendix 17 Guideline on PRISM Submission . 27.1 MIV-1 Applications There are two submission routes - abridged or verification route. An application may be submitted via the verification route if: (i) The proposed variation(s) is identical to those approved by one of HSA's reference agencies; and (ii) The application is accompanied by the proof of approval or approved product labels of that reference agency. Applications that do not fulfil the above requirements should be submitted via the abridged route. For each product registration, applicants may submit up to a maximum of five concurrent MIV-1 applications at any one time. 27.1.1 Submitting multiple/consequential changes MIV-1 changes can be grouped into a single MIV-1 application if the changes are consequential. A consequential change refers to a change that is unavoidable and a direct result of another change, e.g., consequential change of manufacturing process due to a change of manufacturing site. Applicants should indicate the main change as the primary change and any consequential change(s) as the secondary change(s) in the PRISM application form. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 167 of 170 Non-consequential MIV-1 changes should be submitted in separate MIV-1 applications, e.g., MIV-1 changes in product labelling for clinical information should not be grouped with any quality MIV-1 changes. For MIV applications containing both MIV-1 and MIV-2 changes, the application should be categorised as MIV-1. 27.2 MIV-2 Applications Please note that at any one time, there can only be one MIV-2 application per product registration. Multiple changes are allowed in a single MIV-2 application. 27.2.1 MIV-2 Notification MIV-2 change(s) can be implemented if there is no objection from HSA within the notification timeline of 40 working days, excluding stop-clock. 27.2.2 MIV-2 Do-and-Tell Please refer to Appendix 13C and 14C for the list of Do-and-Tell changes. Applicants have 2 submission options: (i) 6-Monthly Notification Consolidate all \"Do-and-Tell\" changes that have been implemented within a 6- month timeframe of the scheduled submission periods of January (changes made from July to December of the preceding year) and July (January to June of the present year). (ii) Flexible Notification Submit a Do-and-Tell change anytime as a MIV-2 submission, or together with other standard MIV-2 changes provided that the change was implemented within the preceding 6 months. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 168 of 170 If the same Do-and-Tell change was amended and re-implemented during the 6- month timeframe, only the latest version of the change should be submitted. You may also combine Do-and-Tell changes in an MIV-1 application provided that these are consequential changes. Please refer to the table below for examples: Scenario What you should do 1 You have 3 Do-and-Tell changes implemented in March, May and June within the same year. Combine the changes in one MIV-2 Do-and-Tell application and submit by the end of July of the same year. 2 You have implemented a Do-and- Tell change in March, but omitted this in your July submission package. You may submit the omitted change as a standalone or combined MIV-2 application after the submission period, latest by September(6 months from implementation). 3 Your MIV-2 is still pending notification by HSA in January and you need to submit a Do-and- Tell variation. You may submit the Do-and-Tell variation after the pending MIV-2 application has been processed (within 6 months of implementation), or make a written request to include the Do-and-Tell change in the pending MIV-2 application. 4 You have prepared one Do-and- Tell MIV-2 submission package scheduled for July. However you need to also submit an urgent MIV-2 variation at the same time. You may combine both changes in the same MIV-2 application. GUIDANCE ON THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE JUNE 2023 HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY - HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP Page 169 of 170 5 You have submitted a MIV-2 Do- and-Tell application which is pending processing. However you need to submit an urgent MIV-2 change. You may withdraw the pending MIV-2 Do-and-Tell application and resubmit a fresh MIV-2 application which incorporates both the additional MIV- 2 change and the previously submitted Do-and-Tell change. .
