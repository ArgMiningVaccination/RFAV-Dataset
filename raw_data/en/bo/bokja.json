University of California, San Francisco Anne Case, PhD and Angus Deaton, PhD Princeton University Adrian Gallop, FIA UK Government Actuary's DepartmentOctober 27, 2022 Active participation in the Society of Actuaries is an important aspect of membership. While the positive contributions of p rofessional societies and associations are well -recognized and encouraged, association activities are vulnerable to close antitrust scrutiny. By their very nature, associations bring togethe r industry competitors and other market participants. The United States antitrust laws aim to protect consumers by preserving the free economy and prohibiting anti -competitive busine ss practices; they promote competition. There are both state and federal antitrust laws, although state antitrust laws closely follow federal law. The Sherman Act, is the pri mary U.S. antitrust law pertaining to association activities. The Sherman Act prohibits every contract, combination or conspiracy that places an unreasonable restraint on trade. There are, h owever, some activities that are illegal under all circumstances, such as price fixing, market allocation and collusive bidding. There is no safe harbor under the antitrust law for professional association activities. Therefore, association meeting part icipants should refrain from discussing any activity that could potentially be construed as having an anti -competitive effect. Discussions relating to product or service pricing, market alloca tions, membership restrictions, product standardization or other conditions on trade could arguably be perceived as a restraint on trade and may expose the SOA and its members to antit rust enforcement procedures. While participating in all SOA in person meetings, webinars, teleconferences or side discussions, you should avoid discussing competitively sensitive information with competitors and follow these guidelines: Do not discuss prices for services or products or anything else that might affect prices Do not discuss what you or other entities plan to do in a particular geographic or product markets or with particular customers. Do not speak on behalf of the SOA or any of its committees unless specifically authorized to do so. Doleave a meeting where any anticompetitive pricing or market allocation discussion occurs. Doalert SOA staff and/or legal counsel to any concerning discussions Doconsult with legal counsel before raising any matter or making a statement that may involve competitively sensitive informati on. Adherence to these guidelines involves not only avoidance of antitrust violations, but avoidance of behavior which might be s o construed. These guidelines only provide an overview of prohibited activities. SOA legal counsel reviews meeting agenda and materials as deemed appropriate and any discussion that departs from the formal agenda should be scrutinized carefully. Antitrust compliance is everyone's responsibility; however, please seek legal counsel if you have any questions or concerns. SOA Antitrust Compliance Guidelines 22Presentations are intended for educational purposes only and do not replace independent professional judgment.

Presentation Disclaimer 3Mortality has been affected around the world by the COVID -19 Pandemic. What will follow? Successive variants of the COVID -19 virus have sustained its impact even with the development of groundbreaking vaccines in record time. This pandemic will resolve to endemic but will have some lasting effects But our scope today is to look past the pandemic to prospects for future mortality: Will we move back to the modest trends of the last decade? Or to the rapid advances of the last century? Future pandemics, medical advances, and our behavior will determine the course. We have today a remarkable group of scientists to provide their views and to discuss areas of contrast and agreement 4United States Mortality declined rapidly through 2009, but has since decelerated. We have been overestimating improvement. Are we approaching human limits on longevity, with remaining diseases more difficult to address, in addition to the effects of our own behavior, like increased obesity? 5 7007508008509009501,0001,0501,100 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025Age-Sex-Adjusted Death Rates (per 100,000) Total, All Ages 2014TR 2017TR 2020TR 2021TR 2022TR ActualIs There an Omega?

University of California, San Francisco Society of Actuaries Annual Meeting Thursday October 27, 2022 Session 13A 14Epidemiology of SARS -CoV-2-related mortality First of all, we are not post -COVID However, we have just seen the decline of the sixth wave of transmission in the World and in the U.S. and probably the start of the seventh in Europe 15 United StatesCase counts are no longer predictive of actual incidence of SARS -CoV-2 infection in the U.S. Widespread use of home diagnostic kits has led to massive undercounting of symptomatic cases Sewage outfall data are now being used to track incident infection 16SARS -CoV-2 variants have different mortality risks Original Wuhan strain had a case fatality rate of about 10% (first wave) Last year's delta variant had a case fatality rate of 3.4% (South African data) This year's omicron variant has a case fatality rate of 1.9% Differences are even greater when calculating infection fatality rate Vaccination, especially boosting reduces risk of hospitalization and mortality but is highly variable across the county The virus will continue to evolve in response to immune pressures, and newer variants may arise Sigal A, Jassat W. Estimating disease severity of Omicron and Delta SARS - CoV-2 infections. Nature Rev 2022; 22:267- 69. 17So where are we? Rapidly evolving epidemic with newer variants and subvariant tending to less severe disease What we need to know What is the incidence of infection? What are the case fatality and infection mortality rates by variant and subvariant? What is the effect of vaccination on risk of infection and severe outcomes Will this fall's bivalent vaccine be even better? How much immunity does naturally acquired infection provide and for how long (by variant)? And we haven't even touched post -acute sequelae of acute SARS -CoV-2 infection (PASC, long COVID) 18 On forecasting mortality rates Anne Case and Angus Deaton, October 2022 19GOING BACK TO THE PAST IS UNLIKELY TO WORK Because previous trends were broken BEFORE the pandemic LE at birth fell in three of the four years prior to the pandemic Deaths of despair rising rapidly Suicides, drug overdose, alcoholic liver disease Rate of decline in deaths from CVD slowed or flattened (obesity?)

Suicide fell in pandemic Alcoholic liver disease and drug deaths rose rapidly during pandemic Also CVD deaths as we have seen in 2020 and more in 2021 Some argue because of the pandemic We are skeptical, and these deaths may remain elevated in years ahead Suicide may also rise again Major uncertainty associated with deaths of despair in 2022 and beyond Depending on whether current increases will go away post -pandemic 26Perspective from the UK Government Actuary's Department Adrian Gallop FIA 27Age standardised mortality rates, Males & Females, E&W 28Number of deaths registered by week, UK, week ending 13 March 2020 to 30 September 2022 2905,00010,00015,00020,00025,000 13 Mar 2020 13 Sep 2020 13 Mar 2021 13 Sep 2021 13 Mar 2022 13 Sep 2022 Deaths not involving COVID Deaths involving COVID-19 All deaths - Five-year average Source: ONSCumulative standardised mortality rate compared to 2019 30Source: CMI mortality monitor -week 38 of 2022 Excess deaths by cause of death; weeks ending 6 May 2022 to 23 Sept 2022 Cause of Death Registered DeathsExcess Deaths Excess %Underlying Cause COVIDNon- COVID excessNon Office for Health Improvement and DisparitiesPotential effects Elevated cardiovascular risk following COVID infection Delays for urgent medical treatment e.g. ambulance response times longer than target, bed blocking Disruption to new diagnoses as well as the treatment of chronic conditions Waiting lists - 6.7m cf4.4m Feb 20 Hidden health needs 32 Potential drivers for future mortality change Changes in bio -medical technology Effectiveness of health care systems Behavioural changes related to health: Smoking prevalence Lifestyles Obesity Emergence of new diseases ( egHIV, SARS) Antimicrobial resistance Re-emergence of old diseases ( egTB) Future economic conditions Climate change Environmental change, disasters, wars Changes in population composition; cohort effects, migrants 33Questions?Appendix Slides: Steve GossTrends in Obesity: US 1971 -2006 Sam Preston 2010 Must consider cumulative effects --Increasing duration of obesity for aged in future 36Health Spending Cannot Continue to Rise at Historical Rates \u2014 Effects on Mortality?

Rose by 5% in Canada, but declined by 20% in the US.Appendix Slides: Adrian GallopLong COVID Estimated 2.3 million people living in private households in the UK (3.5% of the population) experiencing self -reported long COVID (symptoms continuing for more than 4 weeks after the first confirmed or suspected COVID -19 infection that were not explained by something else) as of 3 September 2022 Of these 1.1 million (46%) had COVID at least one year previously, and 514,000 (22%) at least two years previously. 342,000 (15%) reported that their ability to undertake their day -to-day activities had been \"limited a lot\" due to Long COVID. Source: ONS 42 Direct and indirect health impacts of COVID -19 in England Area Findings Direct mortality and morbidity impacts of Covid -19 Deaths and hospitalisations from Omicron much lower than previous waves Higher mortality in more deprived areas Impact of Covid -19 on NHS critical care capacity Omicron did not increase the number of Covid- 19 positive patients in critical care beds. Increases in staff absence may have led to increased pressure in critical care. 43Source: Direct and indirect health impacts of COVID -19 in England: emerging Omicron impacts, Aug 2022 Dept for Health and Social Care and ONSArea Findings Indirect impacts of Covid -19 on population health due to living through a pandemic and restrictions Primary care appointments and referrals were resilient during the Omicron wave of infection. However, lower overall activity across the pandemic has led to 'missing' appointments and referrals. Reported incidence of some conditions has returned to pre -pandemic trends, other conditions are still persistently below the pre -pandemic trend. Staff absences continue to put pressure on the NHS. Supply constraints during the Omicron wave of infection have led to longer waits for elective and emergency patients in secondary care. Elective activity remains below pre -pandemic levels. Referrals to and people in touch with mental health services are higher than pre-pandemic level. Indirect impacts of Covid -19 on the wider population in the long -run Adult social care has suffered from pre -COVID pressures, including workforce pressures, which have been exacerbated by the pandemic Economic impacts from Omicron smaller than those seen during previous waves of infection. Non-Covid -19 pressures mean wider economic climate remains fragile. 44Cancer -impact of delays in diagnosis and treatment during the pandemic Decreasing life expectancy Increasing life expectancy Medical staff leaving profession Government pledge to increase nursing numbers Backlog means later diagnosis/treatment meaning worse prognosis. Could impact for next 5 -10 yearsMRNA vaccines used for COVID trialled to treat cancer; in early stages If patient education not improved not all will go to doctor, screening etc. Widen gap between socio economic groupsHubs being set up to deal with backlog Possible direct impact on cancer incidents could be increased e.g. lung fibrosis from COVID linked to lung cancer. Other cancers not yet linked but could be 20 years before we knowGenetic testing/personalised care -further off for cancer, but innovations like this possible. But lack of money/staff could delay this. Technology making screening/diagnosis/treatment more efficientMore self screening (screening rates didn't decline during pandemic)Less affected by recession as relatively cost effective 45Potential drivers for future mortality change Climate change UK typically has higher death rates in winter. During five heat -periods between June and August 2022 the number of deaths was 6.2% above the five -year average. The average number of deaths per day was higher for heat -period days than non-heat -period days. Each heat -period peak, was followed by a fall in deaths to below the average over the following days; this suggests a short -term mortality displacement, where deaths among vulnerable individuals are 'brought forward' to within the heat -periods. Excess winter deaths higher than excess summer deaths so warming may lead to lower deaths overall, excluding other potential effects of global warming 46 "}
