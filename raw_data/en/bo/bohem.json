( 2 ) OJ No L 214, 24.8.1993, p. 1. Whereas to the same end, an extension fee should be laid down for subsequent applications regarding a medicinal product which has already been authorized in order to take account of the additional work and expenditure where an applicant chooses to submit the appli \u00ad cations gradually and subsequently; Whereas provision should be made for a reduced fee for applications which may be sustained by a less detailed dossier pursuant to point 8 of the second paragraph of Article 4 of Council Directive 65/65/EEC of 26 January 1965 on the approximation of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action relating to medicinal products ( 1 ) and point 8 of the second paragraph of Article 5 of Council Directive 81/851/EEC of 28 September 1981 on approximation of the laws of the Member States relating analytical, pharmaco-toxicological and clinical standards protocols in respect of the testing of veterinary medicinal products ( 2 ) respectively and for applications concerning a medicinal product for use in non-food producing animals; Whereas the examination of variations to the terms of existing auth \u00ad orizations not requiring full evaluation of the product's quality, safety and efficacy should be charged according to the complexity of the variations and the real workload linked to them, and therefore at a rate far lower than for a standard application; Whereas the work involved in the mandatory five-yearly renewal of a Community marketing authorization justified the charging of a fee; Whereas a fee should be laid down for arbitration services in the event of disagreement between Member States on applications for authoriz \u00ad ations submitted under the decentralized procedure; Whereas a fee should be levied on a flat-rate basis for any inspection made successively to a marketing authorization at the request or in the interest of its holder; Whereas the market for a veterinary medicinal product differs from that of a medicinal product for human use and therefore justifies a general reduction of the fee; whereas it should furthermore be possible to take account of the particular situation linked to the marketing of certain veterinary medicinal products on an individual basis; whereas this aim can best be achieved by means of special provisions such as a clause for reductions and waivers; Whereas, as regards the evaluation of applications to establish maximum residue limits (MRLs), it is up to the applicant to decide whether to apply separately for the establishment of MRLs or to do so together with his application for a Community marketing auth \u00ad orization in which case the fee incurred for the evaluation of the appli \u00ad cation for authorization should cover the one for the establishment of MRLs; whereas, however, if the applicant deliberately chooses to apply separately for the establishment of MRLs, the additional work and expenditure should be recouped by means of an isolated MRL fee; B 1995R0297 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.04.2015 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 3 ( 1 ) OJ No 22, 9.2.1965, p. 369/65.

Whereas all other fees for the evaluation of veterinary medicinal products should follow the principles described above; Whereas provision should be made for waivers or reductions of the fees stated above under exceptional circumstances for essential public health or animal health reasons; whereas any decision upon those cases should be taken by the Director after hearing the competent committee and on the basis of general criteria laid down by the Agency's Management Board; Whereas a provisional period of three years should be laid down after which the experience gained will enable the financial needs of the Agency to be re-assessed; whereas for practical reasons provision should also be made for machinery to permit rates to be updated over shorter periods; Whereas the Treaty does not provide the necessary powers for fixing fees at Community level, within the framework of a Community system; whereas it is therefore appropriate to have recourse to Article 235 of the Treaty, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: M1 Article 1 Scope Fees for obtaining and maintaining a Community authorisation to market medicinal products for human and veterinary use and for other services supplied by the Agency shall be levied in accordance with this Regulation.
