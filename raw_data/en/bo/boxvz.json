Over time, certain chapters have been retired or moved to other components. To avoid confusion, the chapters in the PSC manual do not shift to account for these changes; therefore, chapters 8 and 13 are not listed in the Table of Contents or included in this document. January 202 3 1 - 1 National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Overview The NHSN is a secure, Internet -based surveillance system that expands and integrates patient and healthcare personnel safety surveillance systems managed by the Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Facilities that participate in certain reporting programs operated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) can do so through use of NHSN. Furthermore , some U.S. states use NHSN as a means for healthcare facilities to submit data on health care -associated infections (HAIs) and other healthcare measures mandated through their specific state legislation. NHSN enables healthcare facilities to collect and use data about HAIs, adherence to clinical practices known to prevent HAIs, the incidence or prevalence of multidrug- resistant organisms within their organizations, trends and coverage of healthcare personnel safety and vaccination, and adverse events related to the transfusion of blood and blood products. The NHSN includes seven components: Patient Safety, Long-term Care Facility, Outpatient Dialysis, Healthcare Personnel Safety, Biovigilance , Outpatient Procedure , and Neonatal (Figure 1). Figure 1: NHSN Components January 2023 NHSN Overview 1 - 2 The Patient Safety Component includes five modules that focus on events associated with medical devices, surgical procedures, antimicrobial agents used during healthcare, and multidrug resistant organisms . Device -associated Module: o Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI - Central line -associated bloodstream infection) o Central line insertion practices (CLIP) adherence o Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI - Catheter -associated urinary tract infection) o Pediatric Ventilator -associated events (PedVAE) (NICU and pediatric locations only) o Ventilator -associated events (VAE) (adult locations only) o Pneumonia (VAP - Ventilator -associated pneumonia) - in pediatric locations (in-plan* or off-plan*), or NICU and adult locations (off -plan* only) Procedure-assoc iated Module: o Surgical Site I nfection (SSI) Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module (AUR) Multidrug -Resistant and Clostridium difficile Infection (MDRO/CDI) Module *Note : \"In-plan\" surveillance means that the facility has committed to following the NHSN surveillance protocol, in its entirety, for that particular event, as shown in the facility's NHSN monthly reporting plan. \"Off-plan\" surveillance is surveillance that is done because a facility has decided to track a particular event for internal use. Data that are entered into NHSN \"off -plan\" are not included in NSHN annual reports or other NHSN publications. A facility makes no commitment to follow the NHSN protocol for \"off -plan\" events. Further, \"off-plan\" data cannot be uploaded into NHSN via Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) and must be manually entered . Instructions and standardized surveillance methods and definitions for each module of the Patient Safety Component are provided in this manual and on the NHSN website (www.cdc.gov/nhsn ). Modules may be used singly or simultaneously. The NHSN Long -term Care Facility Component provides long- term care facilities (LTCFs) with standardized surveillance methods and definitions for four modules: (1) Multidrug resistant organism Tract Infections (UTI); (3) Prevention Process Measures ; and 4) COVID -19. The component is ideal for use by nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities, chronic care facilities, assisted living and r esidential care facilities , intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities, psychiatric residential treatment facilities, and State Veteran's Homes . LTCF surveillance protocols, training materials, data collection forms, instru ctions, and other supporting materials are provided on the Long -term Care Facility Component website: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/ltc/index.html . Outpatient hemodialysis centers have several surveillance options tailored to their patients and setting in the Dialysis Component . The component consists of 4 modules: 1) Dialysis Event; (2) Prevention Process Measures; (3) Dialysis Patient Influenza Vaccination ; and 4) COVID -19. Facilities that treat hemodial ysis outpatients should refer to the Dialysis Component instructions and standardized surveillance methods and definitions at www.cdc.gov/nhsn/dialysis/index.html . There are two modules in the Healthcare Personnel Safety (HPS) Component of NHSN: T he Healthcare Personnel Exposure Module and the Healthcare Personnel Vaccination Module. The Healthcare January 2023 NHSN Overview 1 - 3 Personnel Exposure Module includes Blood/Body Fluid Exposure Only; Blood/Body Fluid Exposure with Exposure Management; and Influenza Exposure Management. This module is no longer available for enrollment and should only be used by facilities that have already been reporting Blood/Body Fluid Exposure and Exposure Management data to the system. The Healthcare Personnel Vaccination Module includes Influenza Vaccination Summary and COVID -19 Vaccination Summary . Data collected in this surveillance system can assist healthcare facilities, health systems, and public health agencies to monitor and report trends in blood/body fluid exposures, to characterize antiviral medication use for exposures to influenza, and to monitor influenza and COVID -19 vaccination coverage among healthcare personnel. These modules may be used separately or simultaneously. Instructions and standardized surveillance methods and definitions for the Healt hcare Personnel Vaccination Summary is provided in the Component Protocol https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/hps Information on reporting COVID -19 Vaccination Summary data for healthcare personnel can be found https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/hps/weekly -covid -vac/index.html . The NHSN facilitates national surveillance of transfusion -related recipient adverse events. The Hemovigilance Module is designed for transfusion service staff to collect data on annual facility and transfusion service characteristics, individual reports on adverse transfusion reactions, errors or accidents associated with adverse reactions, and monthly counts of transfused or discarded components. The Hemovigilance Module surveillance protocol, training materials, data collection forms, instructions, and other supporting materials are provided on the Hemovigilance Module website: www.cdc.gov/nhsn/acute- care -hospital/bio-hemo/index.html . The Outpatient Procedure Component (OPC) includes two modules that focus on adverse events associated with surgical procedures performed in Ambulatory Surgery Centers (ASCs). The two modules include Same Day Outcome Measures and Surgical Site I nfections . Same Day Outcome Measures (OPC-SDOM) are a grouping of outpatient care quality indicators that represent a broad ran ge of risks encountered by patients accessing care in various outpatient settings. The four individual outcome measures are: o Patient Burn o Patient Fall o Wrong Site, Wrong Side, Wrong Patient, Wrong Procedure, Wrong Implant o All-Cause Hospital Transfer/Admission Surgical Site I nfection (OPC -SSI) - SSI surveillance for outpatient operative procedures using the Outpatient Procedure Component (OPC) . The OPC surveillance protocols, training materials, data collection forms, instructions, and other supporting materials are provided on the Outpatient Procedure Component website: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/ambulatory -surgery/index.html . The Sepsis/ Meningitis (LOS/MEN). This module will track late -onset sepsis and meningitis events in very low birthweight neonates housed in Level II/III, Level III, and Level IV nursery locations. The following events will be tracked in the LOS/MEN mo dule: January 2023 NHSN Overview 1 - 4 Late -Onset Sepsis Event: In an eligible infant, a recognized pathogen or common commensal identified from one or more blood specimens by a culture or non -culture based microbiologic testing method which is performed for purposes of clinical diagnosis or treatment. Under this major type of infection, there are two specific types of infection (see below). o NLCBI 1 o NLCBI 2 Meningitis Event: In an eligible infant, a recognized pathogen or common commensal identified from a CSF specimen by a culture or non -culture based microbiologic testing method which is performed for purposes of clinical diagnosis or treatment. Under this major type of infection, there are two specific types of infection (see below). o NLCM 1 o NLCM 2 The LOS/MEN surveillance protocols, tr aining materials, data collection forms, instructions, and other supporting materials are provided on the Neonatal Component website: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/neonatal/index.html Surveillance Techniques Surveillance for healthcare acquired conditions/infections require a combination of active, concurrent, prospective or retrospective approaches and surveillance techniques and resources. Trained Infection Preventionists and designees shall seek out infections/conditions by screening a variety of data sources, such as laboratory, pharmacy, admission/discharge/transfer, radiology/imaging, and pathology databases, as well as patient charts, including history and physical exam notes, nur ses'/ physicians ' notes, temperature charts, etc. Others may be trained to screen data sources for these events , but the IP must make the final determination. Laboratory -based surveillance should not be used alone, unless all possible criteria for identifying an infection are solely determined by laboratory evidence ( for example , LabID event detection in the MDRO/CDI Module). Retrospective chart reviews should be used only when patients are discharged before all information can be gathered. NHSN f orms should be used to collect all required data, using the NHSN definitions of each data field. To minimize the IP's data collection burden, others may be trained to collect the denominator data and process of care data ; additionally, electronic capture o f data is an option for reporting as an aide to optimizing available resources . Procedure -Associated Module Surgical site infection (SSI) monitoring is offered through this module. SSI surveillance requires active, patient-based, prospective surveillance techniques (see Surveillance Techniques above). To minimize IPs' workload of collecting denominator data, operating room data may be downloaded (see file specifications at https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/ps -analysis-resources/ImportingProcedureData.pdf ) SSI monitoring requires active, patient-based, prospective surveillance. Concurrent and post -discharge surveillance methods should be used to detect SSIs following inpatient operative procedures and post- discharge surveillance for outpatient operative procedures. These methods may include 1) direct examination of patients' wounds during hospitalization, or follow -up visits to either surgery clinics or January 2023 NHSN Overview 1 - 5 physicians' offices, 2) review of medical records or surgery clinic patient records, 3) visits to the ICU and wards; talk with primary care staff 4) surgeon surveys by mail or telephone, and 5 ) patient surveys by mail or telephone (though patients may have a difficult time assessing their infections). Any combination of these methods (or other methods identified by the facility) with the capacity to identify all SSIs is acceptable for use; however, NHSN criteria for SSI must be used. See Surgical Site Infection Event (SSI) protocol for additional examples of concurrent and post -discharge surveillance methods (www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/pscmanual/9pscssicurrent.pdf ). Device- Associated Module Medical instrumentation increases the risk of development of a n HAI and most patients admitted for health care are expose d to a medical device in the course of their treatment. Such devices include, but are not limited to, vascular and urinary catheters, and ventilators. NHSN enables facilities to monitor infectious complications associated with the use of these devices and to monitor processes related to their use which might increase infection risk. Specifically, surveillance of central line -associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), catheter -associated urinary ), and/or ventilator -associated pneumonia (VAP) is possible using the NHSN. In addition, central line insertion practices (CLIP) can be monitored 'off plan' to inform facilities of the appropriateness of their processes and how they may relate to HAI development. See Dialysis Component for detailed instructions for Dialysis Event (DE) surveillance of hemodialysis outpatients (www.cdc.gov/nhsn/dialysis/index.html ). Device -assoc iated denominator data should be collected at the same time each day, or by weekly sampling methods in certain locations, for minator data are available from electronic databases ( for example , ventilator days from respiratory therapy), these sources may be used as long as the counts are not substantially different (+/ - 5%) from manually -collected counts that have been validated f or a minimum of three months. See the respective device -associated event protocols for detailed surveillance instructions. Antimicrobial Use and Resistance (AUR) Module The use of antimicrobial agents has a direct effect on antimicrobial resistance patte rns of pathogens. The observed increase in multidrug resistance is in part due to inappropriate prescription of, as well as only partial completion of courses of antibiotics. The AUR Module allows facilities to collect information on the amount of antimicrobials that are used for patient care within their systems, as well as to collect data on the prevalence of drug -resistant organisms in their inpatient and outpatient areas. Electronic capture and reporting of microbiology and pharmacy data are the onl y available options for reporting data into this module. See the Antimicrobial Use and Resistance protocol for detailed surveillance instructions. January 2023 NHSN Overview 1 - 6 Multidrug -resistant Organism an d Clostridium difficile Infection (MDRO/CDI) Module The NHSN MDRO/CDI Module offers a means for facilities to meet criteria and metrics that are outlined in several organizational guidelines to control and measure the spread of MDROs and CDI within their healthcare system. The module has two separate and independent reporting options, Laboratory- identified (LabID) E vent and Infection Surveillance that may be tailored to meet the needs of participating NHSN facilities . In addition, the following process measures are available: (1) adherence to hand hygiene; (2) adherence to contact precautions when caring for patients infected or colonized with an MDRO or C. difficile ; and (3) adherence to active surveillance testing (AST) of MRSA and/or VRE. Active surve illance testing outcome measures is also available in locations where AST adherence is being performed and enables facilities to use the results of AST to monitor the incidence and prevalence of positive MRSA and/or VRE cultures . See the MDRO/CDI protocol for detailed surveillance instructions. January 2023 2-1 Identifying Healthcare- associated Infections (HAI) for NHSN Surveillance The purpose of Chapter 2 is to standardize the classification of an infection as present on admission (POA) or a healthcare -associated infection (HAI), using objective surveillance definitions and guidance for NHSN surveillance. The intention of this chapter is to align criteria and definitions and decrease subjectivity while maintaining epidemiologic standardization and clinical relevance. A variety of scenarios to include repeat infections of the same type, concurrent infections of differing types, and pathogen assignment in multi -pathogen infections are addressed. See Appendix Flow Diagram for NHSN Event Determination.

The guidance found in this Chapter is not applicable when performing surgical site infection ( SSI), ventilator associated event ( VAE), pediatric ventilator associated event ( PedVAE ) or laboratory - identified ( LabID ) event. Infection window period (IWP), date of event (DOE) , present on admission (POA) , healthcare-associated infection (HAI) , and repeat infection timeframe (RIT) , secondary BSI attribution period (SBAP) definitions as defined in this chapter do not apply to SSI , VAE, PedVAE , or LabID events (Table 1 ). Refer to Chapters 9, 10, 11 and 12 for guidance specific to these event determinations . January 2023 Identifying Healthcare-associated Infections 2-2 Table 1: Module Exceptions to application of Chapter 2 Timeframes (Page 2 -2) Concept SSI LabID VAE PedVAE Infection Window Period Not Applicable Not Applicable Not Applicable Not Applicable Date of Event Present on Admission Healthcare -associated Infection Repeat Infection Timeframe Secondary BSI Attribution Period 2. Organisms belonging to the following genera are typically causes of community -associated infections and are rarely or are not known to be causes of healthcare -associated infections. They are excluded and cannot be used to any refer to the individual event protocols for pathogen exclusions specific to the event being reported for example, bloodstream infection ( BSI), urinary IAB) infections . 3. If the date of specimen collection is on or after the date of documentation of evidence of consent AND the patient is being supported for organ donation purposes, an event identified using the specimen culture result or microbi ologic non -culture based diagnostic test result should not be reported as an HAI. The patient should, however, still be included in device and patient day denominator data collection. 4. Hospice, palliative, or comfort care patients are not excluded from NHSN surveillance. 5. Identification of organisms from specimens collected during post -mortem examination (autopsy) are only eligible for use in meeting the central nervous system ( CNS)/intracranial ( IC) infection definition and the p neumonia ( PNEU) infection definition using lung tissue specimen obtained by transthoracic or transbronchial biopsy immediately post-mortem. For all other NHSN definitions autopsy specimens/reports are not eligible for use. 6. Infections occurring in newborns with date of event on hospital day 1 or day 2 are considered present on admission ( POA ). Those with date of event on day 3 or later are healthcare -associated infections ( HAI). This includes infections acquired transplacentally (for example but not limited to herpes simplex, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, or syphilis) or as a result from passage through the birth canal. Exception: See guidance about non -reporting of central line-associated bloodstream infections ( CLABSIs) with Group B Streptococcus during a neo nate's first 6 days of life found in the Comments and Reporting Instructions section of the Bloodstream Infection Event (central line -associated bloodstream infection and non-central line -associated bloodstream ) protocol. January 2023 Identifying Healthcare-associated Infections 2-3 7. Reactivation of a latent infec tion (for example but not limited to herpes, shingles, syphilis, or tuberculosis) is not considered to be an HAI. 8. For purposes of NHSN surveillance, if an observation patient is admitted to an inpatient location, the patient must be included in all surveillance events designated in the monthly reporting plan and included in patient and device day counts. The patient is being housed, monitored, and cared for in an inpatient location and therefore is at risk for acquisition of an HAI. Infection Window Period The infection window period (IWP) is defined as the 7 -days during which all site -specific infection criteria must be met. It includes the collection date of the first positive diagnostic test that is used as an element to meet the site -specific i nfection criterion, the 3 calendar days before and the 3 calendar days after (Table 2 ). For purposes of defining the IWP the following examples are considered diagnostic tests: laboratory specimen collection imaging test procedure or exam Table 2: Infection Window Period It is important to use the first diagnostic test that creates an infection window period during which all elements of the criterion can be found. See example below. Example When meeting pneumonia ( PNEU) definition using the PNU2 criterion, identification of an eligible organism from blood or from a site-specific specimen, and an imaging test may be available. Both the organism identification and the imaging test are diagnostic tests. Use the first diagnostic test for which all elements of the PNU2 criterion occur within the IWP. In this example below, Option 1 uses the imaging test (not the blood culture) to set the IWP. This is the first diagnostic test that creates an IWP in which all elements of PNU2 criterion occur. January 2023 Identifying Healthcare-associated Infections 2-4 Infection Window Period Special Considerations 1. Infection criteria that do not include a diagnostic test: For site -specific infection criteria that do not include a diagnostic test , the date of the first documented localized sign or symptom that is used as an element of the site-specific infection crite rion is used to define the infection window period (IWP) for example, diarrhea, site -specific pain, or purulent drainage. A non-specific sign or symptom such as fever is not considered localized, and therefore is not used to define the IWP. For example, when meeting endometritis ( EMET ) using criterion 2, there is no diagnostic test as a part of this criterion. The date of the first documented localized sign or symptom, purulent drainage or pain or tenderness that is used as an element to meet EMET criterion 2 is to be used to set the IWP. Fever is not a localized sign. Infection window period (IWP) Present on Admission (POA) Healthcare -associated Infection ( HAI) Option 1: Correct diagnostic test use Option 2: Incorrect diagnostic test use HD IWP HD IWP -2 -2 -1 -1 1 1 2 POA New onset cough 2 New onset cough 3 Imaging test: Infiltrate 3 HAI Imaging test: Infiltrate 4 Fever > 38.0 C 4 Fever > 38.0 C 5 Fever > 38.0 C 5 Fever > 38.0 C 6 Blood culture: A. baumannii 6 Blood culture: A. baumannii 7 Rales, Fever > 38.0 C 7 Rales, Fever > 38.0 C 8 Cough, Rales 8 Cough, Rales 9 9 10 10 11 11 12 12 13 13 14 14 15 15 16 16 17 17 Hospital Day = (HD) January 2023 Identifying Healthcare-associated Infections 2-5 2. More than one criterion can be met: When more than one criterion of a site- specific infection definition is met, identify the IWP that results in the earliest date of event. Example A patient has purulent drainage noted at a superficial wound site on hospital day 2. It is documented on da y 3 that the wound site is painful, and swelling is present. S. aureus is identified from a wound specimen with collection date on day 4. SKIN definition can be met using criterion 2a with pain, swelling and positive culture from the site -specific specime n (diagnostic test) and met using criterion 1 with purulent drainage (sign). Using the sign of infection, purulent drainage, to set the IWP results in criterion 1 being met and provides the earliest date of event. January 2023 Identifying Healthcare-associated Infections 2-6 Hospital Day = (HD) 3. Endocarditis: When meeting the e ndocarditis ( ENDO) definition, t he IWP is lengthened to accommodate the extended diagnostic timeframe that is frequently required to reach a clinical determination of endocarditis . The ENDO IWP is 21 days and include the 10 calendars days before and the 10 calendar days after the first positive diagnostic test that is used as an element of the ENDO infection criterion. Infection window period (IWP) Date of event (DOE) SKIN Criterion 1: Correct Determination SKIN Criterion 2a: Incorrect Determination HD IWP HD IWP -2 -2 -1 -1 1 1 2 DOE Purulent Drainage from wound (SKIN criterion 1) 2 3 3 DOE Pain, Swelling (SKIN Criteria 2a) 4 4 Drainage Culture: S. aureus 5 5 6 6 7 7 8 8 9 9 10 10 11 11 12 12 13 13 14 14 15 15 16 16 17 17 January 2023 Identifying Healthcare-associated Infections 2-7 Date of Event (Event Date) The date of event (DOE) is the date the first element used to meet an NHSN site -specific infection criterion occurs for the first time within the seven -day infection window period ( Table 3 and Table 4 ). An infection is considered present on admission (POA) if the date of event of the NHSN site - specific infection criterion occurs during the POA time period, which is defined as the day of admission to an inpatient location (calendar day 1), the 2 days before admission, and the calendar day after admission. For purposes of NHSN surveillance and determination of the repeat infection timeframe (as defined below) if the DOE is determined to be either of the two days prior to inpatien t admission, then the date of event will be hospital day 1. An infection is considered a healthcare -associated infection (HAI) if the date of event of the NHSN site-specific infection criterion occurs on or after the 3rd calendar day of admission to an inpatient location where day of admission is calendar day 1. Note: Accurate determination of DOE is critical because DOE is used to determine: if an event is HAI or POA location of attribution device association day 1 of the Repeat Infection Timeframe Table 3: Date of Event and Classification Determination January 2023 Identifying Healthcare-associated Infections 2-8 Table 4: Infection Window Period and Date of Event Note the date of event is the date the first element used to meet the site -specific infection criterion occurs for the first time in the IWP. In the first example, it is day 2, the date the fever occurs for the first time in the IWP, this results in a POA determination. In the second example it is day 4, the date of the diagnostic test, which is the first element in the IWP, and this results in an HAI determination. Date of event may be, but is not always, the date of the diagnostic test which is used to set the IWP. Example 1: POA Determination Example 2: HAI Determination HD IWP HD IWP 1 1 2 DOE Fever > 38.0 C 2 3 3 4 Urine culture: >100,000 CFU/ ml E. coli 4 DOE Urine culture: >100,000 CFU/ ml E. coli 5 5 Fever > 38.0 C 6 6 Fever > 38.0 C 7 7 8 8 9 9 10 10 11 11 12 12 13 13 14 14 15 15 16 16 17 17 UTI-POA Date of Event: HD 2 Pathogen: E. coli UTI-HAI Date of Event: HD 4 Pathogen: E. coli Hospital Day = (HD) Infection window period (IWP) Date of event (DOE) January 2023 Identifying Healthcare-associated Infections 2-9 Notes: Acceptable documentation includes patient -reported signs or symptoms within the POA timeframe, documented in the medical record by a healthcare professional. Information communicated verbally from facility to facility, or information found in another facility's medical record cannot be used unless also documented in the current facility's medical record ( except for post -discharge SSI surveillance). For example, the following would be eligible for use if documented in the current facility's medical record : o patient states measured fever > 38.0\u00b0 C or >100.4\u00b0 F occurring in the POA timeframe o nursing home reports fever > 38.0\u00b0 C or >100.4\u00b0 F prior to arrival to the hospital and occurring in the POA timeframe o patient complains of dysuria o copy of laboratory test result from another facility Physician diagnosis can be accepted as evidence of an infection only when physician diagnosis is an element of the specific infection definition: o For example, physician diagnosis is not an element of any UTI definition; therefore, physician diagnosis of a UTI may not be used to satisfy the UTI definition. o For example, physician diagnosis is an element of EAR definition; therefore, physician diagnosis of otitis interna may be used to satisfy the inner ear infection definition. Location of Attribution (LOA) The inpatient location where the patient was assigned on the date of event (DOE) is the location of attribution (LOA) (see date of event definition). Non -bedded patient locations, for example, Operating Room (OR) or Interventional Radiology (IR) are not eligible for assignment of LOA for HAI events. Location of attribution must be assigned to a location where denominator data (for example, patient days, device days) can be collected. Transfer Rule (Exception to Location of Attribution) If the date of event is on the date of transfer or discharge, or the next day, the infection is attributed to the transferring/discharging lo cation. This is called the Transfer Rule. If the patient was in multiple locations within the transfer rule time frame, attribute the infection to the first location in which the patient was housed the day before the infection's date of event. See examples below. When the transfer rule is invoked following facility discharge from one facility and admission to another, receiving facilities should share information regarding the HAI with the transferring facility. Such information should include all informa tion necessary to determine that HAI criteria are met. Sharing of HAI data between facilities promotes consistency and accuracy in reporting HAI data. Surveillance after the patient is discharged from the facility is not required. However, if discovered, any infection with a DOE on the day of discharge or the next day is attributable to the discharging location and should be included in any data reported to NHSN for that location. January 2023 Identifying Healthcare-associated Infections 2-10 Note: Although the transfer rule does not apply to SSI or LabID events, fac ilities should always share information of potential HAI events that may occur before or following transfers between facilities. Refer to Chapter 9 and Chapter 12 for guidance regarding SSI and LabID events. o Location Example: Date Patient Location Location of Attribution 3/22 Unit A -- 3/23 Unit A Unit B -- 3/24 Date of Event Unit B Unit A 3/25 Unit B -- o Facility Example: Date Patient Location Location of Attribution 3/22 Facility 1 --- 3/23 Facility 1 Facility 2 --- 3/24 Date of Event Facility 2 Facility 1 3/25 Facility 2 --- o Multiple transfers within the same facility during the same admission example In instances where a patient has been transferred to more than one location on the date of an infection, or the day before, attribute the infection to the first location in which the patient was housed the day before the infection's date of event.

The RIT applies to both POA and HAI determinations. The date of event is Day 1 of the 14 -day RIT. If criteria for the same type of infection are met and the date of event is within the 14 -day RIT, a new event is not identified or reported. The original date of event and the original 14 -day RIT are maintained . Additional pathogens recovered during the RIT from the same type of infectio n are added to the event. Device association determination and location of attribution are not to be amended. See examples in Table 5 and Table 6 below. The RIT will apply at the level of specific type of infection with the exception of BSI, UTI, and PNEU where the RIT will apply at the major type of infection. Specific Type Example: Patients will have no more than one SKIN infection reported in a SKIN RIT, but may have overlapping or simultaneous SKIN RIT and decubitus ulcer infection ( DECU ) RIT Major Type Examples: Patients will have no more than one BSI reported in a BSI RIT labor atory - confirmed bloodstream infection (LCBI 1, LCBI 2, and LCBI -3) or mucosal barrier injury laboratory confirmed bloodstream infection ( MBI-LCBI 1, MBI-LCBI 2, and MBI-LCBI 3) Patients will have no more than one PNEU reported in a PNEU RIT (PNU1, PNU2, PNU3). Patients will have no more than one UTI reported in a UTI RIT ( symptomatic urinary tract infection [ SUTI ] or asymptomatic bacteremic urinary tract infection [ABUTI ]) The RIT applies during a patient's single admission, including the day of discharge and the day after, in keeping with the Transfer Rule . An RIT does not carry over from one admission to another even if readmission is to the same facility. The RIT for endocarditis (ENDO) is extended to include the remainder of the patient's current admission. January 2023 Identifying Healthcare-associated Infections 2-12 In the example below ( Table 5 ), the date of event is hospital day 4. The 14 -day RIT is hospital day 4 through day 17. On hospital day 12, within the RIT, a urine cultur e with > 100,000 CFU/ml S. aureus is identified. The urine pathogen identified from the hospital day 12 culture is added to the originally identified infection on hospital day 4. Determination of a new infection or continuation of ongoing infection is not required. The original date of event and the RIT are maintained.

Date of event, device association, or RIT does not change. January 2023 Identifying Healthcare-associated Infections 2-14 Secondary BSI Attribution Period The Secondary BSI Attribution Period*(SBAP) is the period in which a blood specimen must be collected for a secondary bloodstream infection to be attributed to a primary site infection This period includes the infection window period combined with the repeat infection timeframe (RIT). It is 14 -17 days in length depending upon the date of event. (Refer to Appendix B, Secondary Bloodstream Infection (BSI) Guide of the BSI Event Protocol). A bloodstream infection can only be determined secondary to another site of infection if the following requirements are met: An NHSN site -specific definition must be met; either one of the CDC/NHSN Surveillance Definitions for Specific Types of Infections (defined in Chapter 17), or UTI, PNEU or SSI definition. AND One of the following scenarios must be met: Scenario 1: At least one organism from the blood specimen matches an organism identified from the site -specific infection that is used as an element to meet the NHSN site -specific infection criterion and the blood specimen is collected in the secondary BSI attribution period (infection window period + repeat infection timeframe). OR Scenario 2: An organism identified in the blood specimen is an element that is used to meet the NHSN site-specific infection criterion, and therefore is collected during the site -speci fic infection window period. Determination of a secondary BSI to a primary site of infection does not set an RIT for all subsequent BSIs. If a blood culture occurs during a site-specific infection's secondary BSI attribution period and it cannot be used as an element to meet the infection definition or does not have at least one matching pathogen to the site -specific infection culture used to meet the site -specific infection criterion, the BSI must be evaluated as a new BSI event . *Notes: When meeting the endocarditis (ENDO) definition, the secondary BSI attr ibution period includes the 21 -day infection window period and all subsequent days of the patient's current admission. o As a result of this lengthy secondary BSI attribution period, secondary BSI pathogen assignment for ENDO, is limited to organism(s) identified in blood specimen that match the organism(s) used to meet the ENDO definition. January 2023 Identifying Healthcare-associated Infections 2-15 For example, if the ENDO definition was met using a site-specific specimen (cardiac vegetation) or using a blood specimen where S. aureus was the identified organism an d subsequently a blood specimen collected during the ENDO secondary BSI attribution period (but outside of the IWP) is positive for S. aureus and E. coli , while the S. aureus can be assigned to the ENDO event, it cannot be assumed the E.coli can be assigned as a secondary BSI pathogen. The blood organism ( E. coli ) does not match the organism ( S. aureus ) used to meet the ENDO definition. If the blood specimen can be used to meet an ENDO definition criterion both organisms can be assigned. Otherwise, the E. coli will need to be investigated as a separate BSI and be identified as a secondary BSI to another site - specific infection or determined to be a primary BSI. Exception: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) criteria does not include a site-specific specimen or an organism identified from a blood specimen ; however, an exception for assigning a BSI secondary to NEC is provided. A BSI is considered secondary to NEC if the patien t meets one of the two NEC criteria AND an organism identified from a blood specimen collected during the secondary BSI attribution period is an LCBI pathogen, or the same common commensal which is identified from two or more blood specimens drawn on separate occasions collected on the same or consecutive days. January 2023 Identifying Healthcare-associated Infections 2-16 Secondary BSI Attribution Period Tables: In the example below ( Table 7 ), the Date of Event is hospital day 4. The 14 -day RIT is hospital day 4 through day 17. S. aureus is identified in the urine during the SUTI RIT; therefore, this organism is added to the SUTI-1 event. The Secondary BSI Attribution Period is the Infection Window Period combined with the Repeat Infection Timeframe, in this example it is 17 days. The blood culture collected on hospital day 10 has a matching pathogen to the site-specific culture used to meet the SUTI definition, and therefore, a secondary BSI is identified.

The 14 -day RIT is hospital day 4 through day 17. The secondary BSI Attribution Period is 17 days in length. The blood culture collected on hospital day 5 is used as an elem ent to meet the PNU2 infection definition and therefore a secondary BSI is identified.

Eligible pathogens identified following the initial secondary BSI during the RIT from the same type of infection are added to the event. Report all site-specific pathogens before secondary BSI pathogens. If at least one BSI pathogen with a collection date in the secondary BSI attribution period matches organism from a specimen ( either a site-specific specimen or a blood specimen) that was used to meet a site -specific infection criterion, additional eligible BSI pathogens from the same blood specimen are also considered secondary to the event and are reported with the event . BSI pathogens may be assigned to more than one infection source at the same time in the following scenarios. 1) Secondary BSI pathogen assigned to two different site -specific infections (see Example 1 ) OR 2) Secondary BSI pathogen assigned to a site -specific infection and assigned as pathogen to a primary BSI event (see Example 2 a). MBI-RIT Exception : An MBI -LCBI designation will not change to an LCBI event if the following criteria are met: 1. The blood culture with the non-MBI organism is collected during an existing BSI (MBI -LCBI) RIT AND 2. The blood culture with the non-MBI organism is deemed secondary to an NHSN site - specific infection (see Example 2b ). Example 1: K. pneumoniae is identified in a blood culture during the SBAP of a SUTI with K. pneumoniae . The patient also has documen tation of fever (>38.0o C) and abdominal pain with an abdominal abscess seen on imaging . These three elements, when combined with a positive blood culture, meet IAB criterion 3b. Both UTI and IAB HAIs are identified , each with a secondary BSI and K. pneumoniae as the pathogen.

On day 8 the patient has a fever > 38.0\u00b0 C, and E. coli is identified in a urine culture meeting the SUTI definition. On hospital day 13, a blood culture positive for E. coli is identified. Becaus e the blood culture occurs within both the LCBI RIT and the SUTI secondary BSI attribution period, the pathogen, E. coli is assigned to both events.

During the BSI RIT of the MBI-LCBI 1 event, a blood culture with a non-MBI organism ( Staphylococcus aureus ) is collected but is deemed secondary to a SKIN 2a. Because the Staphylococcus aureus (a non -MBI organism) is secondary to the SKIN 2a, the MBI-LCBI 1 designation will not change to an LCBI 1. Two separate events meet definition: MBI-LCBI with E. faecalis, and a Skin 2a with S. aureus an element of the definition.

The excluded organism must be accounted for as either: 1) A primary bloodstream infection (BSI/CLABSI) OR 2) A secondary BSI attributed to another primary infection (for example, to an IAB or SINU), in accordance with Appendix B, Secondary BSI Guide of the BSI Event protocol Example 3 : A SUTI with Enterococcus faecalis is identified and a subsequent blood culture with yeast and E. faecalis is collected during the SUTI secondary BSI attribution period. A BSI secondary to SUTI is identified. E. faecalis is already documented as a pathogen, but the yeast will not be reported as a secondary BSI pathogen, because yeasts are excluded as organisms in the UTI definition. In this example, no other primary source of infection for which the yeast BSI can be assigned as secondary is identified. Therefore, a primary BSI with yeast only is identified. Note: The E. faecalis is not assigned as a pathogen for the p rimary BSI because if an excluded organism had not been identified, a primary BSI would not have been reported.

The positive chest imaging result is the diagnostic test that is used to define the infection window period. A subsequent blood culture with Enterococcus faecalis and A. baumannii is collected during the secondary BSI attribution period of this PNU2 event. Enterococcus faecalis will not be reported as a pathogen for the PNU2, because Enterococcus spp. are excluded as organisms in the PNEU definition. Another primary source of infection, SUTI, is found and Enterococcus faecalis is assigned as a secondary BSI pathogen.

On hospital day 15 (also within the SUTI RIT and secondary BSI attribution period), a blood culture growing Staphylococcus aureus is identified. Because the blood growing S. aureus does not have at least one pathogen that matches the urine culture used to meet the SUTI criterion the BSI cannot be attributed as secondary to the SUTI. The BSI will need to be investigated as a new BSI event and either assigned as a secondary BSI to another primary site of infection or determined to be a primary BSI. Note: The secondary BSI attribution period for a primary site of infection does not establish a repeat infection timeframe for all subsequent BSIs. When identifying a BSI which appears to fall within a BSI-RIT, it is important to verify the initial BSI was indeed a primary BSI and not a secondary BSI to site-specific event. Only primary BSIs create a BSI RIT, therefore, incorrectly establishing a BSI -RIT f or a secondary BSI event can result in the inaccurate assignment of a BSI pathogen(s) and the identification of a true CLABSI event will likely be missed ( see Example 6 ).

The S. aureus will need to be investigated as a new BSI event . January 2023 Identifying Healthcare-associated Infections 2-26 Example 6: Initially a BSI was identified as POA and therefore not further investigated. Upon identification of a subsequent BSI, it cannot be assumed that the POA BSI set a BSI RIT. Instead, it must be verified that the initial BSI was indeed a primary BSI and not a secondary BSI to a site -specific infection. In the example below, upon further review the initial BSI was determined to be a secondary BSI to a SKIN infection. The SKIN Secondary BSI Attribution Period does not capture all subsequent BSIs. In this examp le it can only account for BSIs that have at least one matching pathogen to the site-specific specimen (wound drainage) used to meet SKIN. The BSI on hospital day 9 does not match and it also was determined not to be secondary to another site- specific infe ction and therefore a CLABSI is identified.

This allows CDC to select the data that should be incl uded in the aggregate data analysis used for creating national benchmarks . Data submitted to NHSN may represent either \"in-plan\" or \"off -plan\" surveillance. \"In-plan\" surveillance means that the facility has committed to following the NHSN surveillance protocol, in its entirety, for that particular event, as shown in the facility's NHSN monthly reporting plan. \"Off -plan\" surveillance is surveillance that is done because a facility has decided to track a particular event for internal use. Each participating facility must identify and enter a monthly reporting plan (MRP) to indicate the module(s) used, if any, and the events , locations and/or procedures th at will be monitored in-plan . The modules and locations selected for the month represent in -plan surveillance and indicate that the NHSN surveillance protocols will be used in their entirety, for that surveillance . Only in -plan data are submitted to The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) in accordance with CMS's Quality Repo rting Programs and included in NHSN annual reports or other NHSN publications . \"Off-plan\" surveillance is surveillance performed because a facility is tracking a particular event for non-NHSN use. A facility makes no commitment to follow the NHSN protoco l for \"off-plan\" events and such data are not included in CMS Quality Reporting Programs, NHSN annual reports or other NHSN publications. An MRP must be completed f or every month for which data are entered into NHSN ; a facility may choose the option \"No NHSN Patient Safety Modules Followed this Month. \" The MRP should reflect reporting requirements (for example, local, state, or CMS mandates) when applicable to the facility. The MRP is the first step in indicating the data that NHSN should submit to CMS as part of the CMS Quality Reporting Programs. Instructions for completing the Patient Safety Monthly Reporting Plan form can be found in the Table of Instructions. Annual Facility Survey One or more annual facility surveys must be completed upon enrollment in NHSN, activation of an NHSN component, and/or identification of select CMS -certified units. Thereafter, at the beginning of each year, a new facility survey(s) must be completed to reflect data from the prior calendar year. For example, at the beginning of 202 3, an acute care hospital completes a 20 22 Annual Hospital Survey containing data from 202 2. January 2023 Monthly Reporting Plan and Annual Surveys 3 - 2 Surveys must be completed by March 1st each year. If no completed annual facility survey is submitted by March 1st, no MRP s can be entered until the applicable annual survey(s) is complete . The Patient Safety Component has separate surveys for the following types of facilities: Hospital (includes the following hospital types: Affairs): Patient Safety Component - Annual Hospital Survey (57.103) Long-term Acute Care (LTAC) Hospital: Patient Safety Component - Annual Facility Survey for LTAC (57.150 ) Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility (includes free -standing rehabilitation facilities and CMS-certified inpatient rehabilitation units located within a hospital): Patient Safety Component - Annual Facility Survey for IRF ( 57.151) Instructions for completing the Annual Survey form can be fou nd in the Table of Instructions . A link to the Table of Instructions form is included on each of the annual survey forms.

January 2023 Device-associated Module BSI 4 - 2 Bloodstream Infection Event (Central Line -Associated Bloodstream Infection and Non -central Line Associated Bloodstream Infection) Introduction Although a 46% decrease in CLABSIs has occurred in hospitals across the U.S . from 2008-2013, an estimated 30,100 central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) still occur in intensive care units and wards of U.S. acute care facilities each year.1 CLABSIs are serious infections typically causing a prolongation of hospital stay and increased cost and risk of mortality. CLABSIs can be prevented through proper insertion techniques and management of the central line. These techniques are addressed in the CDC's Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (CDC/HICPAC) Guidelines for the Prevention of Intravascular Catheter -Related Infections, 2011 . 2 Settings Surveillance may occur in any inpatient location where denominator data can be collected, which can include critical/intensive care units (ICU), specialty care areas (SCA), neonatal units including neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), step down units, wards, and long -term acute care units . A complete listing of inpatient locations and instructions for mapping can be found in the CDC Locations and Descriptions chapter. Note: CLABSI surveillance after patient discharge from a facility is not required . However, if discovered, any CLABSI with a date of event (DOE) on the day of or the day after discharge is attributed to the discharging location and should be communicated to that facility to encourage appropriate NHSN reporting of CLABSIs . (See Transfer Rule, Chapter 2 ). Do not collect or report additional central line days after discharge. Key Terms and Abbreviations Refer to the NHSN Patient Safety Manual, Chapter 2 Identifying Healthcare Associated Infections in NHSN and Chapter 16 NHSN Key Terms for definitions of the following universal concepts for conducting HAI surveillance. I. Date of event (DOE) II. Healthcare associated infection (HAI) III. Infection window period (IWP) IV. Present on admission (POA) V. Repeat infection timeframe (RIT) VI. Secondary BSI attribution period (SBAP) VII. Location of Attribution (LOA) VIII. Transfer rule January 2023 Device -associated Module BSI 4 - 3 Definitions Specific to Bloodstream Infection ( BSI) / Central Line Associated Bloodstream Infection ( CLABSI ) Surveillance: Primary bloodstream infection (BSI): A Laboratory Confirmed Bloodstream Infection (LCBI) that is not secondary to an infection at another body site (see Appendix: Secondary BSI Guide and CDC/NHSN Surveillance Definitions for Specific Types of Infection [Ch -17], tract infection ( UTI) surgical site infection ( [Ch - 9]. Laboratory Confirmed Bloodstream Infection (LCBIs) Hierarchy; Types of LCBIs (see Table 1 and Table 2 ): Secondary BSI: A BSI that is thought to be seeded from a site-specific infection at another body site (see Appendix: Secondary BSI Guide and CDC/NHSN Surveillance Definitions for Specific Types of Infection, UTI, PNEU , and SSI) . Secondary BSI Attribution Period (SBAP): T he period in which a blood specimen must be collected for a secondary BSI to be attributed to a primar y site of infection . This period includes the Infection Window Period (IWP) combined with the Repeat Infection Timeframe (RIT) . It is 14 -17 days in length depending upon the date of event ( See Secondary BSI Attribution period, Chapter 2 ). Infusion: The a dministration of any solution through the lumen of a catheter into a blood vessel . Infusions include continuous infusion (for example, nutritional fluids or medications), intermittent infusion (for example, IV flush), IV antimicrobial administration, and blood transfusion or hemodialysis treatment . Access: The performance of any of the following activities during the current inpatient admission: Line placement Use of (entering the line with a needle or needleless device) any central line for: o Infusion o Withdrawal of blood Use for hemodynamic monitoring January 2023 Device -associated Module BSI 4 - 4 Notes: 1. If a patient is admitted to an inpatient location with a central line (CL) already in place, and it is the patient's only CL, the day of first access in an inpatient location begins the central line day count (CL Day for making central line-associated determinations ). De -accessing any type of c entral line (for example, removal of port needle but port remains in body) does not remove the patient from CLABSI surveillance nor from device day counts for reporting denominator summary data . 2. An inpatient location, for making determinations about cen tral line access, includes but is not limited to, any department or unit within the facility that provides service to inpatients [for example, inpatient Dialysis, Operating Room (OR), Interventional Radiology, Gastroenterology Lab (GI), Cardiac Catheteriza tion lab (CC), wards, ICUs, etc.] . 3. Include any inpatient receiving dialysis in CLABSI surveillance conducted in the patient's assigned inpatient location, regardless of whether the patient only has one CL and dialysis staff are the only providers to access it during dialysis treatment . Examples: CLABSIs in the following examples will be attributed to Unit A Patient on Unit A receives onsite dialysis by contracted dialysis staff Dialysis staff travels to Unit A to provide dialysis to an Unit A patient Patient in Unit A for inpatient care is transported to dialysis unit within the facility for dialysis Because CLABSI events cannot be attributed to a non -bedded inpatient location (inpatient location where denominator data is not collected but inpatient care is provided, for example, OR, IR, or inpatient dialysis ), such events must be attributed to the inpatient location housing the patient. Central line (CL): An intravascular cathet er that terminates at or close to the heart, or in one of the great vessels AND is used for infusion, withdrawal of blood, or hemodynamic monitoring. Consider the following great vessels when making determinations about CLABSI events and counting CL devic veins Common iliac veins Femoral veins In neonates, the umbilical artery/vein. January 2023 Device -associated Module BSI 4 - 5 Notes: 1. Neither the type of device nor the insertion site is used to determine if a device is considered a central line for NHSN reporting purposes. 2. At times, a CL may migrate from its original central location after confirmation of proper placement . NHSN does no t require ongoing verification of proper line placement . Therefore, once a line has been designated a CL it remains a CL, regardless of migration, until removed from the body or patient discharge, whichever comes first . CL days are included for any CLABS I surveillance conducted in that location . 3. An introducer is an intravascular catheter, and depending on the location of the tip and its use, may be considered a CL. 4. A non -lumened intravascular catheter that terminates at or close to the heart or in a gre at vessel that is not used for infusion, withdrawal of blood or hemodynamic monitoring is not considered a CL for NHSN reporting purposes (for example, non -lumened pacemaker wires.) There are some pacemaker wires that do have lumens, which may be consider ed a central line. Types of Central Lines for NHSN reporting purposes : 1. Permanent central line: Includes: a. Tunneled catheters, including tunneled dialysis catheters b. Implanted catheters (including ports) 2. Temporary central line: A non -tunneled, non-implanted catheter 3. Umbilical catheter : A vascular catheter inserted through the umbilical artery or vein in a neonate. All umbilical catheters are central lines. Eligible Central Line: A CL that has been in place for more than two consecutive calendar days (on or after CL day 3), following the first access of the central line, in an inpatient location, during the current admission . Such lines are eligible for CLABSI events and remain eligible for CLABSI events until the day after removal from the body or patient discharge, whichever comes first . (See Table 3 for examples ). Eligible BSI Organism: Any organism that is eligible for use to meet LCBI or MBI-LCBI cri teria . In other words, an organism that is not an excluded pathogen for use in meeting LCBI or MBI-LCBI criteria . These organisms may or may not be included on the NHSN organism list . Contact NHSN for guidance regarding organisms that are not included on the NHSN organism list . Central line -associated BSI (CLABSI): A laboratory confirmed bloodstream infection where an eligible BSI organism is identified, and an eligible central line is presen t on the LCBI DOE or the day before. Central line days : The number of days a central line is accessed to determine if an LCBI is a CLABSI . Denominator device days: The count of central lines on an inpatient unit that is recorded in the monthly denominator summary data . This count begins on the first day the central line is present, regardless of access. January 2023 Device -associated Module BSI 4 - 6 Devices Not Considered Central Lines for NHSN Reporting Purposes: Arterial catheters unless in the pulmonary artery, aorta or umbilical artery Arteriovenous fistula Arteriovenous graft Atrial catheters (also known as transthoracic intra-cardiac catheters, those catheters inserted directly into the right or left atrium via the heart wall) Extracorporeal life support ( ECMO) Hem odialysis reliable outflow (HERO) dialysis catheter Intra -aortic balloon pump (IABP) devices Peripheral IV or Midlines Ventricular Assist Device (VAD) Table 1: Laboratory -Confirmed Bloodstream Infection Criteria: Must meet one of the following LCBI criteria: Criterion Comments and reporting instructions that follow the site -specific criteria provide further explanation and are integral to the correct application of the criteria. Once an LCBI determination is made, proceed to the MBI -LCBI definitions, and determine if the corresponding MBI-LCBI criteria are also met (for example, after meeting LCBI 2 , investigate for potential MBI -LCBI 2) LCBI 1 If LCBI 1 criterion is met, consider MBI-LCBI 1 Patient of any age has a recognized bacterial or fungal pathogen, not included on the NHSN common commensal list: 1. Identified from one or more blood specimens obtained by a culture OR 2. Identified to the genus or species level by non-culture based microbiologic testing (NCT) * method s (for example, T2 Magnetic Resonance [T2MR] or Karius Test) . Note: If blood is collected for culture within 2 days before, or 1 day after the NCT, disregard the result of the NCT and use only the result of the CULTURE to make an LCBI surveillance determ ination . If no blood is collected for culture within this time period, use the result of the NCT for LCBI surveillance determination. AND Organism(s) identified in blood is not related to an infection at another site (See Appendix: Secondary BSI Guide). *For the purposes of meeting LCBI 1 , NCT is defined as a methodology that identifies an organism directly from a blood specimen without inoculation of the blood specimen to any culture media . For instance, NCT does not include identification by PCR of an organism grown in a blood culture bottle or any other culture media prior to performing PCR testing. January 2023 Device -associated Module BSI 4 - 7 Notes: 1. If a patient meets both LCBI 1 and LC BI 2 or LCBI 3 criteria, report LCBI 1 with the recognized pathogen entered as pathogen #1 and the common commensal as pathogen #2. 2. No additional elements (in other words, no sign or symptom such as fever) are needed to meet LCBI 1 criterion ; therefore, the LCBI 1 DOE will always be the collection date of the first positive blood specimen used to set the BSI IWP. LCBI 2 If LCBI 2 criterion is met, consider MBI-LCBI 2 Patient of any age has at least one of the following signs or symptoms: fever (>38.0oC), chills, or hypotension AND Organism(s) identified in blood is not related to an infection at another site (See Appendix: S econdary BSI Guide). AND The same NHSN common commensal is identified by a culture from two or more blood specimens collected on separate occasions (see Blood Specimen Collection). For the list of common commensals, see the Common Commensal tab of the NHSN Organisms List. Notes: 1. Criterion elements must occur within the 7 -day IWP (as defined in Chapter 2 ) which includes the collection date of the positive blood specimen, the 3 calendar days before and the 3 calendar days after. 2. The two matching common commensal specimens represent a single element for use in meeting LCBI 2 criterion and the collection date of the first specimen is used to determine the BSI IWP . 3. At least one element (specifically, a sign or symptom of fever, chi lls, or hypotension) is required to meet LCBI 2 criterion; the LCBI 2 DOE will always be the date the first element occurs for the first time during the BSI IWP, whether that be a sign or symptom or the positive blood specimen.

AND The same NHSN common commensal is identified by a culture from two or more blood specimens collected on separate occasions (see Blood Specimen Collection). For the full list of common commensals, see the Common Commensal tab of the NHSN Organisms List . Notes: 1. Criterion elements must occur within the 7 -day IWP (as defined in Chapter 2 ) which includes the collection date of the positive blood specimen, the 3 calendar days before and the 3 calendar days after. 2. The two matching common commensal specimens represent a single element for use in meeting LCBI 3 crite rion and the date of the first is used to determine the BSI IWP . January 2023 Device -associated Module BSI 4 - 9 At least one element (specifically, a sign or symptom of fever, hypothermia, apnea or bradycardia) is required to meet LCBI 3 criterion ; the LCBI 3 DOE will always be the date the first element occurs for the first time during the BSI IWP whether that be a sign or symptom or the positive blood specimen. -- 5/31 No LCBI element -- - 6/1 No LCBI element - - 6/2 No LCBI element - Single element 6/3 S. epidermidis (1 of 2) Date of 1st diagnostic test = 6/3 LCBI DOE = 6/3 6/4 S. epidermidis (2 of 2) - - 6/5 Apnea documented - - 6/6 No LCBI element - January 2023 Device -associated Module BSI 4 - 10 Table 2: Mucosal Barrier Injury Laboratory -Confirmed Bloodstream Infection (MBI - LCBI) An MBI -LCBI is a subset of the LCBI criteria; therefore, a BSI event must fully meet an LCBI criterion before evaluating for the corresponding MBI-LCBI criterion. The MBI -LCBI DOE will always be the date the prerequisite LCBI criteria are met . Abnormal ANC and WBC values reflect risk factors for acquiring an MBI -LCBI, not symptoms of infection and therefore are not used in DOE determinations. Must meet one of the following MBI -LCBI criteria MBI -LCBI 1 MBI -LCBI 2 MBI -LCBI 3 Patient of any age fully meets LCBI 1 criteri on Patient of any age fully meets LCBI 2 criteri on Patient <1 year of age fully meets LCBI 3 criteri on with at least one blood specimen with at least two matching blood specimens with ONLY intestinal organisms from the NHSN MBI organism list* with ONLY Viridans Group Streptococcus and/or Rothia spp . alone but no other organisms identified by culture or non -culture based microbiologic testing method identified by culture AND Patient meets at least one of the following: 1. Is an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient within the past year with one of the following documented during same hospitalization as positive blood specimen: a. Grade III or IV gastrointestinal graft versus host disease [GI GVHD] OR b. 1-liter diarrhea in a 24 -hour period (or 20 mL/kg in a 24 -hour period for patients <18 years of age) with onset on or within the 7 calendar days before the date the positive blood specimen was collected. OR 2. Is neutropenic, defined as at least two separate days with ANC and/or WBC values <500 cells/mm3 collected within a 7 -day time period which includes the collection date of the positive blood specimen, the 3 calendar days before and the 3 calendar days after (See Table 5 ). January 2023 Device -associated Module BSI 4 - 11 Note s: 1. If a patient meets both MBI -LCBI 1 and MBI -LCBI 2 criteria (specifically has Viridans Group Streptococcus or Rothia spp. plus only other MBI organisms in the blood specimen), report organisms as MBI-LCBI 1 with the recognized pathogen as pathogen #1 and the common commensal as pathogen #2. 2. Any combination of ANC and/or WBC values can be used to meet neutropenic criteria provided they are collected on separate days within the 7 -day period that includes the date of the positive blood specimen, the 3 calendar days before and the 3 calendar days after. 3. When a blood specimen positive for an organism not included on the NHSN MBI organ ism list is collected during the BSI RIT of an MBI-LCBI, the initial MBI -LCBI event is edited to an LCBI and the identified non -MBI organism is added. See MBI organism tab on the NHSN organism list for the full list of eligible MBI organisms. Eligible positive blood specimens must be collected on separate occasions and limi ted to the following: Viridans Group Streptococcus identified in at least two sets of blood specimens Rothia spp. identified in at least two sets of blood specimens Viridans Group Streptococcus and Rothia spp. identified in at least two sets of blood specimens Formula for calculating ANC if not provided by your laboratory: The ANC is not always reported directly in the chart The WBC in the chart is usually reported in terms of thousand cell/mm3 ANC = Absolute Segs + Absolute Bands OR ANC = WBC X %Segs + %Bands \u00f7 Bands 2 k/mm3 20% 20% ANC = 2000 X (20 + 20) \u00f7 100 = 800 cells/mm3 January 2023 Device -associated Module BSI 4 - 12 Reporting Instructions: See below for a Summary of CLABSI Exclusions and Reporting Requirements. When a BSI event in the presence of a central line meets one of the CLABSI exclusions listed below the following guidelines are applied: The event is reported to NHSN but is NOT considered central line associated. The C entral Line field is marked \" Yes\" if an eligible central line has been in place for more than 2 consecutive calendar days on the BSI DOE and is still in place on the BSI DOE or the day before. The events do not contribute to the CLABSI SIR measure. In each instance where the date of event of subsequent positive blood specimens are outside of the established BSI RIT, meeting the exclusion criteria, the subsequent positive blood must be investigated as primary or secondary to another site -specific infection . The CLABSI exclusion criteria must be met again in a new BSI IWP to determine if the positive blood specimen is central line associated . Note: Meeting LCBI criteria in all situations noted below will result in setting a BSI RIT and any associated device days should be included in counts for denominator summary data . a. Extracorporeal life support (ECLS or ECMO ): A BSI meeting LCBI criteria with an eligible central line where extracorporeal life support (for example, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ ECMO ]) is present for more than 2 days on the BSI DOE and is still in place on the DOE or the day before, is cons idered an LCBI . Report such events, marking the ECMO field as \"Yes.\" b. Ventricular Assist Device (VAD): A BSI meeting LCBI criteria with an eligible central line where a VAD is present for more than 2 days on the BSI DOE and is still in place on the DOE or the day before, is considered an LCBI . Report such events, marking the VAD field as \"Yes.\" c. Patient Injection: A BSI meeting LCBI criteria that is accompanied by documentation of observed or suspected patient injection into the vascular access line, within the BSI IWP, will be considered an LCBI but not a CLABSI for NHSN reporting purposes . This exclusion is very specific to \"INJECTION\" . Manipulating or tampering with the line (such as biting, picking at, sucking on, etc.) DOES NOT meet the intent of th is exclusion. The documentation must specifically state the patient was \"observed injecting...\" or \"suspected of injecting...\" the device. Insinuations or descriptive events that suggest such behavior DO NOT meet the intent of this exclusion . Report such events, marking the Patient Injection field as \"Yes .\" d. Epidermolysis bullosa (EB ): If during the current admission, there is document ation of a diagnosis of EB report such an event , mark ing the EB as \"Yes.\" Note : The Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) CLABSI exclusion is limited to the genetic forms of EB in the pediatric population. e. Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy (MSBP): If during the current admission, there is documentation or a diagnosis of known or suspected MSBP, also known as factitious disorder i mposed on another (FDIA) , report such an event, marking the MSBP fields as \"Yes.\" January 2023 Device -associated Module BSI 4 - 13 f. Pus at the vascular access site: Occasionally, a patient with both a n eligible central line and another vascular access device will have pus at the other access site . If there is pus at the site of one of the following vascular access devices and a specimen collected from that site has at least one matching organism to an organism identified in the blood during the BSI IWP, report such events marking the \"pus at the vascular access site\" field as \"Yes.\" Vascular access devices included in this exception are limited to: Arterial catheters unless in the pulmonary artery as transthoracic intra-cardiac catheters, those catheters inserted directly into the right or left atrium via the heart wall) Hemodialysis reliable outflow (HERO) dialysis catheters Intra -aortic balloon pump (IABP) devices Non -accessed CL (those neither inserted nor used during current admission) Peripheral IV or Midlines Reporting Instructions: 1. Group B Streptococcus: Group B Streptococcus identified from blood, with a da te of event during the first 6 days of life, will not be reported as a CLABSI . A BSI RIT is set, and any associated device days should be included in counts for denominator summary data . 2. Do not report a BSI that has a DOE within a BSI RIT. However, ad d additional organisms identified that are eligible for BSI events to the initial BSI event . See RIT guidance in Chapter 2 , Identifying Healthcare asso ciated Infections or Chapter 16 , Key Terms. 3. Only primary BSIs create a 14-day BSI RIT: Primary BSI example: Patient has a positive blood specimen identifying Staphylococcus aureus on hospital day 6, which is not secondary to another site -specific source of infection . A subsequent positive blood specimen is collected on hospital day 12 that identifies Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Because the date of event is during the BSI RIT, no new BSI event is reported, and Pseudomonas is added to the initial BSI event . 4. Secondary BSIs do not create a 14 -day BSI RIT: Secondary example: faecalis is identified and E . faecalis is also collected from a blood specimen on hospital day 11 within the SUTI secondary BSI attribution period . This BSI is secondary to the SUTI . Only a SUTI RIT is set, not a BSI RIT . On hospital day 1 5 (also within the SUTI RIT and secondary BSI attribution period), a blood culture which grows Staphylococcus aureus is collected . Because the blood growing S. aureus does not have at least one pathogen that matches the urine culture used to meet the SUTI criterion , the BSI cannot be attributed as secondary to the SUTI . There is no BSI RIT in effect, therefore the BSI will need to be January 2023 Device -associated Module BSI 4 - 14 investigated as a new BSI event and either assigned as a secondary BSI to another primary site of infection or determined to be a primary BSI. Note: The secondary BSI attribution period of a primary source of infection is not a \"catch all\" for subsequent BSIs . 5. There is no expectation that positive blood specimens collected during the present on admission ( POA) time period are investigated. If identified, they are not reported to NHSN . However, if a subsequent positive blood specimen is collected within 14 days of a positive blood specimen collected during the POA time period, it is imperative that a determination is made for the original blood specimen in order to make the correct determination about the subsequent blood specimen. Example 1: A patient has a positive blood specimen with Escherichia coli (E. coli ) that is a POA on 6/1. On 6/10, a subsequent positiv e blood specimen with Klebsiella pneumonia is collected . The 6/1 blood specimen is investigated and if determined a primary BSI, sets a 14 -day BSI RIT (6/1 -6/14) . Therefore, the 6/10 specimen is not a new BSI event and K . pneumonia is added to the POA BSI event if reported. Example 2: A patient has a positive blood specimen that identifies Staphylococcus aureus present on admission 6/1 . On 6/10, a subsequent posi tive blood specimen with Klebsiella pneumonia is collected . To make the correct determination about the second blood specimen, the initial POA BSI event must be investigated to determine if it is primary or secondary to another site. In reviewing the cha rt, a right elbow culture from 5/31, is also positive for S . aureus , plus the symptoms needed to meet Joint or Bursa infection ( JNT) criterion 3c are documented making BSI secondary to JNT. The POA primary JNT infection creates a 14 -day JNT RIT ( 6/1-6/14), during which no new JNT infections are reported. Because the subsequent blood specimen does not contain at least one matching pathogen to the specimen used to meet the JNT criterion, the positive blood with K. pneumonia cannot be attributed to the original JNT event and must be investigated as a primary or secondary BSI. Blood Specimen Collection The \"two or more blood specimens drawn on separate occasions\" criterion is met if there is blood collected from at least two separate blood draws on the same or consecutive calendar days AND the blood cultures are assigned separate specimen numbers, processed individually, and are reported separately in the final laboratory report. The separate specimen numbers indicate two separate site preparations (decontamination steps) are performed during specimen collection . The guidance above is intended to reduce misidentification of contaminated blood specimens as LCBIs . For example, aseptic technique indicates separate site decontaminations would be performed for blood specimens drawn from different sites (in other words; different venipunctures, a combi nation of venipuncture and lumen withdrawal, or different lumens of the same central line), or at different times . January 2023 Device -associated Module BSI 4 - 15 If both culture sets are positive, there is less chance that contamination was the cause than if 2 positive blood cultures were collected f rom a single blood draw (in other words, collected using a vacutainer or via venipuncture and attaching multiple bottles after a single decontamination of the site), these specimens would be considered a single access (or the same occasion). 1. Specimen Collection Considerations: Blood specimens drawn through central lines can have a higher rate of contamination than blood specimens collected through peripheral venipuncture. 3, 4 However, all positive blood specimens, regardless of the site from which they a re drawn or the purpose for which they are collected, must be included when conducting in -plan CLABSI surveillance (for example, weekly blood cultures performed in hematology and oncology locations). 2. Catheter tip cultures cannot be used in place of blood specimens for meeting LCBI criteria . 3. In MBI-LCBI 1, 2 and 3, \"No other organisms\" means there is no identification of a non -MBI -LCBI pathogen (such as S . aureus ) matching common commensals (such as coagulase-negative staphylococci ) collected from the blood on separate occasions that would otherwise meet LCBI criteria . If this occurs, the infection does not meet MBI -LCBI criteria . 4. When a blood specimen positive for an organism not included on the NHSN MBI organism list is collected during the BS I RIT of an MBI-LCBI, the initial MBI -LCBI event is edited to an LCBI and the identified non- MBI organism is added. MBI-RIT Exception : An MBI -LCBI designation will not change to an LCBI event if the following criteria are met: 1. The blood culture with the non-MBI organism is collected during a n existing BSI (MBI -LCBI) RIT AND 2. The blood culture with the non-MBI organism is deemed secondary to an NHSN site -specific infection See Example 5 in the Secondary BSI Guide section of this protocol and Chapter 2 Pathogen Assignment (Example 2b).January 2023 Device -associated Module BSI 4 - 16 Table 3: Examples of Associating the Use of Central Lines to BSI Events (CLABSI): This table provides examples that illustrate: Device association as determined by the presence of an eligible CL on the BSI DOE or the day before. The goal of NHSN HAI surveillance is to identify risks to the patient that are the result of device use in general; therefore, NHSN does not require association of a BSI with a specific device when more than one line is present. Note : The procedure for de-accessing a port involves ensuring patency of the line prior to remov al of the needle which involves blood withdrawal, an IV flush and injection of an anticoagulant.

A BSI DOE occurring on the day of or the day after device removal or patient discharge is considered a device -associated infection (CLAB SI).

January 2023 Device -associated Module BSI 4 - 18 Pathogen Exclusions and Reporting Considerations: 1. The term \"recognized pathogen\" in LCBI 1 criterion refers to any organism that is not included on the NHSN common commensal list (see NHSN Organism s List for the complete list of common commensals used for NHSN reporting purposes) . Exceptions: a. Organisms that are parasites and vi ruses are excluded as LCBI pathogens . This exclusion applies to meeting a primary BSI only . Viruses and parasites are eligible for use in secondary BSI determinations . b. Organisms belonging to the following genera as LCBI pathogens: Campylobac ter, Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio and as C. difficile, Enterohemorrhagic E. coli , and Enteropathogenic E. coli . These organisms are eligible for use in secondary BSI determinations but will not be reported as the sole pathogen in a primary BSI. c. Organisms belonging to the following genera cannot be used to meet excluded because they typically caus e community -associated infections and are rarely known to cause healthcare-associated infections. 2. Business rules written into the pathogen fields of the NHSN application prevent entry of a common commensal as pathogen #1 when attempting to report both a re cognized pathogen and common commensal identified in an LCBI 1 or MBI-LCBI 1 event . To save the event successfully, enter the recognized pathogen as pathogen # 1 and the common commensal as pathogen #2. 3. For LCBI criteria 2 and 3, if the common commensal i s identified to the species level for one blood specimen, and a companion blood specimen is identified with only a descriptive name, which is complementary to the companion culture (in other words, to the genus level), then it is assumed the organisms are the same . An organism identified to the species level should be reported along with the antibiogram, if available (see Table 4 ). Colony morphology, biotype, and antibiogram comparisons should not be used to determine the \"sameness \"of organisms because laboratory testing capabilities and protocols vary between facilities . To reduce reporting variabilities due to differences in laboratory practice only genus and species identification should be used, and they should only be reported once. If antibiograms are available and the sensitivities differ for the same organisms in separate specimens, always report the more resistant panel (see Tabl e 4). 4. A common commensal identified in a single blood specimen is considered a contaminant . It will not be used to meet LCBI 2 or 3 criteria , secondary BSI attribution, nor will it prevent a case from meeting MBI-LCBI criteria when the organism requirements call for \"only \" a specific organism or type of organism (for example, \"only intestinal organisms from the MBI list\").

Monthly Summary Data Numerator Data: The Primary Bloodstream Infection (BSI) form (CDC 57.108) is used to collect and report each CLABSI that is identified during the month selecte d for surveillance. For CLABSI surveillance, all LCBI and MBI-LCBI that are identified as central-line associated must be included . The Instructions for Completion of Primary Bloodstream Infection (BSI) form contains brief instructions for collection and entry of each data element on the form . The Primary BSI form includes patient demographic information and whether a central line was present, and, if so, the type of central line the patient had if appropriate to the location; these data will be used to calculate line -specific infection rates . Additional data include the specific criteria met for identifying the primary BSI, whether the patient died, organisms identified from blood specimens, and the organisms' antimicrobial susceptibilities . Reporting Instruction: During the month of surveillance, if no CLABSI events are identified, the \"Report No Events\" box must be checked on the appropriate denominator summary screen, (for example, Denominators for Intensive Care Unit [ICU]/other locations [not NICU or SCA], etc .

January 2023 Device -associated Module BSI 4 - 23 Table 7: Denominator Data Collection Methods Denominator Data: Device days and patient days are used for denominator reporting . Device -day denominator data that are collected differ according to the patient location . The following methods can be used for the collection of denominator data: Data Collection Method Details Manual, Daily Denominator data (patient days and device days) should be collected at the same time, every day, for each location performing surveillance to ensure that differing collection methods don't inadvertently result in device days being greater than patient days . For locations other than specialty care areas/oncology (SCA/ONC) and NICUs, the number of patients with at least one central line, of any type, is collected daily, at the same time each day during the month and is recorded on the Denominators for Intensive Care Unit (ICU)/Other Locations (Not NICU or SCA/ONC) form (CDC 57.118) . Only the totals for the month are entered into NHSN. Notes: 1. Only one central line per patient is counted per calendar day regardless of the number of central lines present . 2. All central lines on inpatient units should be included in device day counts regardless of access. For specialty care areas/oncology, the number of patients with at least one central line are separated into those with permanent central lines and those with temporary central lines . The number of patients with at least one central line, of either or both type(s), is collected daily, at the same time each day during the month and is recorded on the Denominators for Specialty Care Area (SCA)/Oncology (ONC) form (CDC 57.117) . Only the totals for the month are entered into NHSN . Temporary and permanent lines are reported separately in this location because permanent lines are more commonly used in this patient population and may be associated with a lower BSI rate when compared to temporary central lines . Notes: 1. Only one centr al line per patient is counted per calendar day regardless of the number of central lines present . 2. All central lines on inpatient units should be included in device day counts regardless of access. January 2023 Device -associated Module BSI 4 - 24 Data Collection Method Details 3. If a patient has both a temporary and a permanent centra l line, only report the temporary line because it is associated with a higher risk of bloodstream infection. The Instructions for Completion of Denominators for Intensive Care Unit (ICU)/Other Locations (Not NICU and SCA/ONC) and Instructions for Completion of Denominators for Specialty Care Areas (SCA)/Oncology (ONC ) contain brief instructions for collection and entry of each data e lement on the form . In NICUs, the number of patients with at least one central line is stratified by birth weight in five categories because the risk of BSI varies by birth weight . These data are reported on the Denominators for Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) form (CDC 57.116). Note: 1. Report only birth weight when entering BSI denominator data . The infant's weight at the time of BSI identification is not used and should not be reported . For example, a neonate weighs 1006 grams at birth but remains in the NICU for two months and has a body weight of 1650 grams when a CLABSI develops; enter the bir th weight of 1006 grams on the BSI form. 2. All central lines on inpatient units should be included in device day counts regardless of access. The Instructions for Completion of Denominators fo r Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) form contains brief instructions for collection and entry of each data element on the forms . Manual, sampled once/week (collected at the same time on the same designated day, once per week) To reduce staff time spent collecting surveillance data, once weekly sampling of denominator data to generate estimated central line days, may be used as an alternative to daily collec tion in non -oncology ICUs and wards (see Notes below) . Sampling may not be used in SCA/ONC locations or NICUs . During the month, the number of patients in the location (patient -days) and the number of patients with at least one central line of any type (central line days) is collected on a designated day each week (for example, every Tuesday), and at the same time each day . Evaluations of this method have repeatedly shown the use of Saturday or Sunday generate the least accurate estimates of denominator data; therefore, weekend days should not be selected as the designated January 2023 Device -associated Module BSI 4 - 25 Data Collection Method Details denominator data collection day.6-8 If the designated day is missed, collect the denominator data on the next available weekday . The following must be collected and entered into NHSN: 1. The monthly total for patient -days, collected daily 2. The sampled total for patient -days 3. The sampled total central line -days When these data are entered, the NHSN application will calculate an estimate of central line -days . Notes: 1. To ensure the accuracy of estimated denominator data obtained by sampling, only ICU and ward location types with an aver age of 75 or more central line -days per month are eligible to use this method . A review of each location's central line denominator data for the past twelve months in NHSN will help determine which locations are eligible . 2. The accuracy of estimated deno minator data generated by sampling can be heavily influenced by incorrect or missing data . Careful implementation of data collection following the guidance in this protocol is essential to avoid erroneous fluctuations in rates or standard infection ratios (SIRs). Electronic For any location, denominator data from electronic sources (in other words, central line days from electronic charting may be used only after a validation of a minimum 3 consecutive months proves the data to be within 5% (+/ -) of the manually collected once -a-day counts . When converting from one electronic counting system to another electronic counting system, the new electronic system should be validated against manual counts as above . If electronic counts for the new electronic system are not within 5% of man ual counts, resume manual counting and continue working with IT staff to improve design of electronic denominator data extraction (while reporting manual counts) until concurrent counts are within 5% for 3 consecutive months. Note: This guideline is import ant because validating a new electronic counting system against an existing electronic system can magnify errors and result in inaccurate denominator counts. Perform the validation of electronic counts separately for each location conducting CLABSI surveil lance. January 2023 Device -associated Module BSI 4 - 26 Data Analyses : All data that are entered into NHSN can be analyzed at event or summary level . The data in NHSN can be visualized and analyzed in various ways, for example, descriptive analysis reports for both the denominator and numerator data . Types of CLABSI Analysis Reports Standardized Infection Ratio (SIR): The standardized infection ratio ( SIR) is calculated by dividing the number of observed events by the number of predicted events . The number of predicted events is calculated using probabilities estimated from negative binomial models constructed from 2015 NHSN data, which represents the baseline population. For more information on SIR and the CLABSI parameter estimates, please see the SIR = () () While SIRs can be calculated for single locations, the measure also allows you to summarize your data across multiple locations, adjusting for differences in the incidence of infection among the location types . For example, you can obtain one CLABSI SIR adjusting for all locations reported . Similarly, you can obtain one CLABSI SIR for all ICUs in your facility . In addition, IRF units within Acute Care Hospitals will be separated from all other ACH locations . For more information on using the CLABSI SIR reports, please see the troubleshooting guide: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/ps -analysis-resources/clabsicauti_sirtroubleshooting.pdf . For further information regarding the p -value and 95% confidence interval, see the following guide: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/ps -analysis-resources/keys -to-success.html Note: The SIR will be calculated only if the number of predicted events (numPred) is 1 to help enforce a minimum precision criterion. Standardized Utilization Ratio (SUR): The SUR, or standardized utilization ratio, is a summary measure used to track device use at a national, state, local, or facility level over time . The SUR adjusts for various facility and/or location-level factors that contribute to device use . The method of calculating an SUR is similar to the method used to calculate the Standardized Infection Ratio (SIR), a summary statistic used in NHSN to track healthcare -associated infec tions (HAIs) . In device-associated HAI data analysis, the SUR compares the actual number of device days reported to what would be predicted, given the standard population (specifically, the NHSN baseline), adjusting for several factors that have been foun d to be significantly associated with differences in device utilization. January 2023 Device -associated Module BSI 4 - 27 In other words, an SUR greater than 1.0 indicates that more device days were observed than predicted; conversely, an SUR less than 1.0 indicates that fewer device days were observed than predicted . SURs are currently calculated in NHSN for the following device types: central lines, urinary catheters, and ventilators . More information regarding the SUR calculations can be found at: More information regarding the SUR calculations can CLABSI r ate per 1000 central line days is calculated by dividing the number of CLABSIs by the number of central line days and multiplying the result by 1000 . The Central Line Utilization Ratio is calculated by dividing the number of central line days by the number of patient days . These calculations will be performed separately for different types of ICUs, specialty care areas, oncology units, and other locations in the institution . Separate rates and ratios will also be calculated for different types of central lines in specialty care areas/oncology locations and for birth weight categories in NICUs. CLABSI Rate = . . * 1000 Device Utilization Ratio The Central Line Utilization Ratio is calculated by dividing the number of central line catheter days by the number of patient days .

January 2023 Device -associated Module BSI 4 - 31 Appendix: Secondary BSI Guide (not applicable to Ventilator -associated Events [VAE]) The purpose of using the CDC/NHSN infection criteria is to identify and consistently categorize infections that are healthcare -associated into major and site -specific infection types . LCBI criteria include the caveat that organism( s) identified from the blood cannot be related to infection at another site (in other words, it must be a primary BSI) . One must be sure there is no other CDC/NHSN defined primary site -specific infection that may have seeded the bloodstream secondarily; o therwise, the bloodstream infection may be misclassified as a primary BSI and erroneously associated with the use of a central line, specifically called a CLABSI . For locations performing in -plan VAE surveillance, refer to Figure B2 in this appendix, as well as the VAE chapter for specific guidance on assigning a secondary BSI to a VAE . When conducting BSI surveillance, the PNEU definitions (as well as UTI, SSI and all definitions found in Chapter 17) a re available for attributing a secondary BSI for any patient in any location. For example, a ventilated patient in an adult location where VAE surveillance is being conducted can have a secondary BSI assigned to VAE or PNEU . A ventilated patient in a neo natal location where in -plan PedVAP surveillance is not an option can have a secondary BSI assigned to PNEU . Secondary BSI Scenarios: For purposes of NHSN reporting, for a bloodstream infection to be determined secondary to another site of infection the following requirements must be met: * An NHSN site -specific definition must be met; either one of the CDC/NHSN Surveillance Definitions for Specific Types of Infections (defined in Chapter 17), or UTI, PNEU or SSI definitions . AND One of the following scenarios must be met: Scenario 1: At least one organism from the blood specimen matches an organism identified from the site-specific specimen that is used as an element to meet the NHSN site-specific infection criterion AND the blood specimen is collected during the secondary BSI attribution period (infection window period + repeat infection timeframe) . OR Scenario 2: An organism identified in the blood specimen is an element that is used to meet the NHSN site-specific infectio n criterion, and therefore is collected during the site -specific infection window period. Exception Notes: 1. The necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) definition does not include criteria for a matching site-specific specimen, nor an organism identified from a blood specimen that can be used as an element to meet the NEC criteria, however an * exception for assigning a BSI secondary to NEC is provided . A BSI is considered secondary to NEC if : The patient meets NEC 1 or NEC 2 AND An organism identified from a blood specimen, collected during the secondary BSI attribution period, is an LCBI pathogen, or the same common commensal identified January 2023 Device -associated Module BSI 4 - 32 from two or more blood specimens drawn on sepa rate occasions that are on the same or consecutive days. 2. The endocarditis (ENDO ) criteria have different rules for infection window period, RIT, pathogen assignment and secondary BSI attribution period . (See ENDO criteria in Ch . 17). Below are examples with guidance on how to distinguish between the primary or secondary nature of a BSI . The definition of \"matching organisms\", important notes and reporting instructions are also provided . See Figure B1 : Secondary BSI Guide for algorithmic display of the following instructions. Scenario 1 : An organism identified from the site-specific infection is used as an element to meet the site-specific infection criterion, AND the blood specimen contains a t least one matching organism to that site -specific specimen. The positive blood specimen must be collected during the site-specific infection's secondary BSI attribution period. (For your convenience, a list of infection criteria that include a blood sp ecimen with at least one matching pathogen to the site-specific specimen that is used as an element to meet the definition are included in Table B1 ). a. Example: Patient meets NHSN criteria for a symptomatic urinary tract infection (suprapubic tenderness and >105 CFU/ml of E. coli ) and blood specimen collected during the symptomatic urinary tract infection ( SUTI ) secondary BSI attribution period positive for Es cherichia . This is a SUTI with a secondary BSI and the reported organism is E. coli. b. Example: Patient meets NHSN criteria for a symptomatic urinary tract infection (suprapubic tenderness and >105 CFU/ml of Escherichia coli) and blood specimen collected d uring the SUTI secondary BSI attribution period grows E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This is a SUTI with a secondary BSI and the reported organisms are E . coli and P. aeruginosa since both site and blood specimens are positive for at least one matching pathogen. c. Example: Patient meets NHSN criteria for a symptomatic urinary tract infection (suprapubic tenderness and >105 CFU/ml of Escherichia coli) and a single blood specimen collected during the SUTI secondary BSI attribution period is positive for E. coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis . This is a SUTI with a secondary BSI and the reported organism is only E. coli since the single common commensal S. epidermidis positive blood specimen by itself does not meet BSI criteria. Scenario 2: An organism identified from a blood specimen is an element used to meet the site-specific infection criterion and is collected during the site -specific infection window period. ( A list of infection criteria that include positive blood culture as an element are included in Table B1 ). a. Example: Patient becomes febrile and complains of nausea and abdominal pain . CT scan done that day shows a fluid collection suggestive of infection . A blood specimen collected that day results in identification of Bacteroides fragilis . Because the patient meets IAB criterion 3b, using the identification of an organisms from the blood specimen as an element (fever, nausea or abdominal pain, positive blood specimen and CT scan showing infection in abdominal cavity), the BSI is considered s econdary to an intra -abdominal ( IAB) infection. January 2023 Device -associated Module BSI 4 - 33 b. Example: Patient is febrile, has a new onset of cough and has positive chest imaging test indicating the presence of an infiltrate . Blood specimens collected identify Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Because the patient can meet the PNU2 definition using the identification of organisms from a blood specimen as one of the elements of the infection criterion (specifically, infiltrate on chest imaging test, fever, new onset of cough and organism identified from blood specimen) , the BSI is considered secondary to PNEU . Note: In situations where an NHSN infection definition can be met using more than one criterion of the infection definition, it is possible that identification of an organism from the blood and site - specific specimens may not match, and a BSI may still be considered a secondary BSI . Consider the following: a. Example: Following a COLO procedure, on day 10 of th e SSI surveillance period the patient becomes febrile (>38.0\u00b0C) and complains of nausea and abdominal pain . A CT scan performed indicates a fluid collection in the abdominal cavity suggestive of infection. The following day culture s are performed that result Escherichia coli from a T-tube drainage specimen and Bacteroides fragilis from a blood specimen . Although the organisms in the site-specific specimen culture and blood culture do not match for at least one organism, the blood culture is considered secondary to IAB . This is because t he patient meets IAB criterion 3b with fever, nausea, and abdominal pain and CT scan results are su ggestive of intraabdominal infection with identification of an MBI organism in a blood specimen by culture. The organism identified in the blood specimen is an element that is used to meet the Organ/Space SSI site -specific infection criterion and is colle cted during the timeframe for SSI elements . Th e patient also meets IAB criterion 3a with fever, nausea, and abdominal pain, and using the organism ( Escherichia coli) identified from the site-specific specimen culture. even though the organism identified (Escherichia coli) is different from that used for IAB criterion 3b (Bacteroides fragilis) . In this case, the BSI is considered secondary to the organ/space SSI IAB and both organisms ( Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis ) would be listed IAB infection pathogens . b. Example: Patient is febrile, has a new onset of cough and has positive chest imaging test indicating the presence of an infiltrate . Blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens are co llected . Results identify Klebsiella pneumoniae > 104 CFU/ml from the BAL and P. aeruginosa from the blood . Although the organisms in the blood specimen and site-specific specimen do not match for at least one organism, because the patient can meet PNU2 definition using either the identification of organism from blood specimen or BAL specimen as one of the elements of the infection criterion ( specifically, infiltrate on chest imaging test, fever, new onset of cough and organism identified from blood speci men or identified from BAL specimen), the blood is considered a secondary BSI to PNEU and both organisms would be listed as PNEU pathogens . Note: If no matching organism is identified from the blood and the site -specific specimen, which is used to meet the site -specific infection definition, and the organism identified from the blood specimen cannot be used to meet the site -specific infection criteria, secondary BSI attribution is not assigned . The BSI is considered primary . January 2023 Device -associated Module BSI 4 - 34 a. Example: Patient has pustules on their abdomen with tenderness and swelling. Purulent material is obtained from the pustules and is positive for Streptococcus Group B . A blood specimen collected the same day identifies methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus . Because the organisms from the site and blood specimens do not match, and there is no site- specific criterion for SKIN that includes organisms identified from blood specimen, both a site-specific infection, SKIN (criteria 1 and 2a) and a primary BSI is reported. b. Example: A patient has an abscess in the soft tissue around a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, identified by CT scan, and there is also purulent drainage from that site. No site -specific specimen was collected, but a blood specim en is positive for Staphylococcus aureus . No other sites of infection are identified. Because no culture of the site is collected, ST criterion 1 is not met , since there is no ST criterion which uses identification of an organism from a blood specimen as an element . This patient has an ST infection (criterion 2), and a primary BSI with the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus for NHSN reporting purposes.

Do not report secondary bloodstream infection for vascular (VASC) infections, ventilator - associated conditions (VAC), infection-related complications (IVAC), or pneumonia 1 ( PNU1 ). When a BSI is suspected to be secondary to a lower respiratory tract infection , the BSI can be determined secondary to VAE or PNEU definitions . (See Figure B2 ). Site-specific organism exclusions apply to secondary BSI attribution as well. A matching organism is defined as one of the following: 1. If genus and species are identified in both specimens, they must be the same. a. Example: An intraabdominal specimen is used as an element to meet an IAB definition and is growing Enterobacter cloacae . A blood specimen with a collection date in the IAB secondary BSI attribution period is growing Enterobacter cloacae . These are considered matching organisms . b. Example: An intraabdominal specimen is used as an element to meet IAB definition and is growing Enterobacter aerogenes . A blood specimen with a collection date in the IAB secondary BSI attribution period is growing Enterobacter cloacae . These are NOT considered matching organisms as the species are different . 2. If one organism is less definitively identified than the other, the lesser identified organism must be identified at least to the genus level and at that level the organisms must be the same. a. Example: A surgical wound growing Pseudomonas species is used to meet deep incisional SSI criteria and a blood specimen growing Pseudomonas aeruginosa is collected in the SSI secondary BSI attribution period . The organisms are considered matching at the genus level and therefore the BSI is secondary to the SSI. b. Example: A PCR identifying Enterococcus faecalis in CSF meets the MEN definition. A subsequent blood culture collected in the MEN secondary BSI attribution period is identified as Enterococcus species . The organisms are considered matching, and therefore the BSI is secondary to MEN . 3. There a re two exceptions to the definition: a. Infections meeting LCBI 2 criterion with Staphylococcus or Streptococcus Example (Staphylococcus ): A patient has a fever and a previous chest tube site is reddened, swollen, and a culture is collected from the soft tis sue. A culture of the chest tube site is positive for Staphylococcus species . SST/ST definition is met . The next day, two blood culture sets are collected. Both are positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus . The organisms are NOT considered match ing, because Staphylococcus January 2023 Device -associated Module BSI 4 - 37 species could represent a coagulase negative or a coagulase positive Staphylococcus . Therefore, the BSI is not considered secondary to SST/ST. Example (Streptococcus): A patient has a fever and a previous chest tube site is red, swollen, and a culture is collected from the soft tissue . The chest tube site culture is reported positive for Streptococcus species . SST/ST definition is met . The next day 2 blood culture sets are collected . The blood cultures are both positive for Streptococcus , viridans group . The organisms are NOT considered matching, because Streptococcus species could represent a Streptococcus , viridans group or - Streptococcus , viridans group . Therefore, the BSI is not considered secondary to SST/ST. b. In cases where an organism is identified only as \"yeast\" or \"yeast not otherwise specified\", the organism can be considered a match to other yeasts, when collected during the required timeframe, whet her more fully identified or not . Example: A culture of tissue from the ulcer margin of a decubiti reported positive for yeast is used as an element to meet the DECU definition. A blood specimen collected in the secondary BSI attribution period of the DECU is reported as Candida albicans . In this example the two organisms are considered matching organisms as the organisms are complementary ( specifically, Candida is a type of yeas t) and because yeasts isolated from non-sterile sites are commonly not identified to the genus or genus and species level. Note: This exception is limited to yeast . It does not apply to identification of organisms as Gram positive cocci, Gram negative r ods, etc. Example : A culture of tissue from the ulcer margin of a decubiti reported positive for a Gram -negative rod is used as an element to meet DECU definition . A blood specimen collected in the secondary BSI attribution period of the DECU is reported as E. coli . In this example the two organisms are NOT considered matching organisms . Notes: 1. Antibiograms of the blood and potential primary site isolates do not have to match. 2. If the blood specimen by itself does not meet BSI criteria (for example, only one blood specimen positive for a common commensal), that specimen may not be used to meet secondary BSI criteria (see Scenario 1c ). January 2023 Device -associated Module BSI 4 - 38 Pathogen Assignment Additional pathogens identified from secondary BSIs, should be added to the pathogens reported for the primary infection type . The Secondary BSI data collection field should be checked yes . MBI-RIT Exception: An MBI -LCBI designation will not change to an LCBI event if the following criteria are met: 1. The blood culture with the non-MBI organism is collected during a n existing BSI (MBI -LCBI) RIT AND 2. The blood culture with the non -MBI organism is deemed secondary to an NHSN site - specific infection See Example 5 in the Secondary BSI Guide section of this protocol and Chapter 2 Pathogen Assignment (Example 2b) If at least one BSI pathogen with a collection date in the secondary BSI attribution period matches an organism from a specimen that was used to meet a site-specific infection criterion (either a site - specific specimen or a blood specimen) the BSI is considered secondary to the event . However, if no matching pathogen is identified, the subsequent BSI pathogen must be evaluated and deemed primary or secondary to another site -specific infection. For example: A patient with a primary UTI with Escherichia coli and a secondary BSI with E. coli has a subsequent positive blood specimen with yeast. Yeast is an excluded pathogen for meeting UTI criteria; therefore, the subsequent blood must be evaluated as primary or secondary to another site -specific infection. A secondary BSI pathogen may be assigned to two different primary sites of infection (for example, UTI and an IAB infection) . In Example 1 below, two primary sites of infection have been identified and a blood culture is collected within both the SUTI and the IAB secondary BSI attribution period . The blood culture pathogen matches the pathogens fo r both primary sites of infection (SUTI and IAB) . Therefore, the pathogen is reported for both primary sites of infection as a secondary bloodstream infection.

In example 2 below, the excluded organism must be accounted for as either 1) a primary bloodstream infection (BSI/CLABSI) or, 2) a secondary bloodstream infection attributed to another primary infection (for example, IAB, SINU) . A blood culture wit h yeast and E . faecalis is collected during the SUTI RIT . A BSI secondary to SUTI is identified. E. faecalis is already documented as a pathogen, but the yeast will not be reported as a secondary BSI pathogen, because yeasts are excluded as organisms i n the UTI definition . Because there is no other primary source of infection for which the yeast BSI can be assigned as secondary, a primary BSI with yeast is identified. Note: The Enterococcus faecalis is not reported as a pathogen for the primary BSI because if an excluded organism had not been identified, a primary BSI would not have been reported.

However, a new event of the same specific type (or major type for BSI, UTI and PNEU ) can be identified during an RIT if all required elements occur within a new IWP and the DOE is within the RIT of the initial event . In example 3, IAB criteria 1 is met on hospital day -4 using organisms identified from purulent fluid . During the IAB RIT (hospital day 4 -hospital day 17), IAB criteria 3a is met (on hospital day 10) using two symptoms, positive imaging evidence of an abscess and a positive blood specimen . The positive blood specimen occurs within the IAB secondary BSI attribution period; therefore, it is considered secondary to IAB . The pathogens, in this case, do not have to match because another definition (IAB 3b) is fully met within a new IAB IWP (hospit al day 8 -hospital day 14) . Because the DOE (hospital day 10) occurs within the RIT of the initial IAB 1, a new event is not reported . The DOE, RIT and device association are not changed but any additional organisms identified ( C. glabrata and L . casei ) are added to the initial IAB event if reported.

However, a new event of the same specific type (or major type for BSI, UTI and PNEU ) can be identified during an RIT if all required elements occur within a new IWP and the DOE is within the RIT of the initial event . In example 4, GIT criterion 2c is met on hospital day -1 using two symptoms, positive imaging evidence of an abscess and a positive blood specimen . During the GIT RIT (hospital day 1 -hospital day 14), GIT criteria 2a is met (on hospital day 11) using two symptoms and a positive abscess culture . The positive blood specimen occurs within the GIT secondary BSI attribution period and matches the organism identified from the abscess culture . Therefore, it is considered secondary to the GIT infection . The pathogens, in this case, do not have to match because another definition (GIT 2a) is fully met within a new GIT IWP (hospital day 8 -hospital day 14) . Because the DOE (hospital day 11) occurs within the RIT of the initial GIT 2c, a new event is not reported . The DOE , RIT, and device associ ation are not changed but any additional organism identified (C . glabrata) is added to the initial GIT event if reported .

A BSI is considered secondary to NEC if the patient meets one of the two NEC criteria AND an organism identified from a blood specimen, collected during the secondary BSI attribution period , is an LCBI pathogen or the same common commensal is identified from 2 or more blood specimens drawn on separate occasions but on the same or consecutive days. January 2023 Device -associated Module BSI 4 - 47 Figure B2: VAE Guidance for Secondary BSI Determination *Secondary BSIs may be reported for possible VAP (PVAP) events, provided that at least one organism identified from the blood specimen matches an organism identified from an appropriate respiratory tract specimen (including respiratory secretions, pleural fluid , and lung tissue) . The respiratory tract specimen must have been collected on or after the 3rd day of mechanical ventilation and within 2 calendar days before or after the day of onset of worsening oxygenation to be considered as a criterion for meeting the PVAP definition. In addition, the blood specimen must have been collected during the 14 -day event period, where day 1 is the day of onset of worsening oxygenation. In cases where PVAP is met with only the histopathology criterio n and no culture or non -culture based test ing is performed on an eligible respiratory specimen, and there is also a positive blood specimen, a secondary BSI to VAE is not reported . In cases where a culture or non -culture based test ing of respiratory secretions, pleural fluid, or lung tissue is performed and does not identify an organism that matches an organism identified from blood, a secondary BSI to VAE is not reported. Note: Any Candida species or yeast not otherwise specified, any coagulase -negativ e Staphylococcus species, and any Enterococcus species identified from blood cannot be deemed secondary to a PVAP, unless the organism was also identified from pleural fluid or lung tissue. January 202 3 5 - 1 Central Line Insertion Practices (CLIP) Adherence Monitoring Introduction Central line -associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) may be prevented through proper placement and management of the central line.1-4 The CDC's Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (CDC/HICPAC) Guidelines for the Prevention of Intravascular Catheter -Related Infections , 20111 recommend evidence -based central line insertion practices known to reduce the risk of subsequent central line -associated bloodstream infection. These include hand hygiene by inserters, use of maximal sterile barriers during insertion, proper use of a skin antiseptic prior to insertion, and time to allow the skin antiseptic to dry before catheter insertion. Several centers have found it useful to monitor adherence to evidence -based central line insertion practices as a method for identifying quality improvement opportunities and strategically targeting interventions. Feedback of adherence data has been a component of multifaceted interventions that have successfully reduced CLABSI rates. Participation in NHSN CLIP surveillance enables participating facilities and CDC to: Monitor central line insertion practices in individual patient care units and facilities and provide aggregate adherence data for all participating facilities ; facilities have the option of recording inserter -specific adherence data Facilitate quality improvement by identifying specific gaps in adherence to recommended prevention practices, thereby helping to target intervention strategies for reducing CLABSI rates Participating facilities may perform surveillance for insertion practices during the following: a month when concurrent CLABSI surveillance is being conducted a month when no CLABSI surveillance is being conducted If participating facilities wish to identify associati ons between insertion practices and outcomes ( specifically , CLABSI), surveillance for insertion practices and CLABSI must be done concur rently. Settings Surveillance may occur in any type of patient care location where central lines are inserted. January 2023 Central Line Insertion Practices 5 - 2 Numerator and Denominator Data The Central Line Insertion Practices Adherence Monitoring Form (CDC 57.125) is used to collect and report central line insertion practices for every central line insertion attempt occurring dur ing the month in the unit(s) selected for surveillance . If an insertion attempt is unsuccessful, report a new CLIP event only if a new site preparation was performed. The Table of Instructions for Completion of the Central Line Insertion Practices Adherence Monitoring Form contains directions for collection and entry of each data element on the form. The form can be completed at or near the time of insertion , either by the inserter or an observ er present at the insertion (for example, a nurse assisting with the catheter insertion ), or the form can be completed from documentation in the patient chart ( only if all elements of the monitoring form have been incorporated into standard central line insertion procedure notes). The form includes information pertaining to demographics of the patient, informa tion pertaining to the inserter, information on maximal sterile barriers used, the reason for central line insertion, whether the insertion was succes sful, skin antisepsis, hand hygiene practice before insertion, type of central line including whether it was antimicrobial coated, insertion site and , if placed because of suspected existing central line infection, the use of a guide wire. Elements of some of these data will be used to calculate adherence to recommended insertion practices. Data Analyses Adherence rates for specific insertion practices will be calculated by dividing the number of bundle- compliant central line insertions (numerator) by the total number of central line insertions (denominator) and multiplying the result by 100. Such calculations can also be done for a bundle of practices that have been shown to reduce the incidence of CLABSI (specifically, NHSN CLIP Bundle) . In NHSN for CLIP insertions dated January 1, 2016 and forward , adherence to the bundle requires a \"Yes\" to all of the following: Hand hygiene performed Appropriate skin prep* o Chlorhexidi ne gluconate (CHG) for patients 60 days old unless there is a documented contraindication to CHG o Povidone iodine, alcohol, C HG, or other specified for children < 60 days old Skin prep agent has completely dried before insertion All 5 maximal sterile barriers used o Sterile gloves o Sterile gown o Cap o Mask worn o Large sterile drape (a large sterile drape covers the patient's entire body) Note: These calculation s are performed separately for different types of locations in the institution. Participants have the option of calculating ins erter -specific adherence rates. *The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has labeled CHG to be used with care in premature infants and infants < 2 months of age .

Ventilator -associated pneumonia (VAP) and other h ealthcare -associated pneumonias are important, common healthcare- associated infections, but national surveillance for VAP has long been a challenge because of the lack of objective, reliable definitions. Due to these challenges, in January 2013 the Nationa l Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) replaced surveillance for ventilator -associated pneumonia (VAP) in adult inpatient locations with surveillance for ventilator -associated events (VAE).2 Based on discussions with an expert January 2023 Device -associated Module PNEU Events 6 - 2 working group in 2012 -2013, NHSN also discontinued in -plan VAP surveillance in neonatal locations. As of January 2014, in -plan VAP surveillance is only available in pediatric inpatient locations. Settings Surveillance may occur in any inpatient pediatric lo cation where denominator data can be collected, such as critical/intensive care units (ped iatric ICUs), specialty care areas (SCA), step -down units, wards, and long- term care units. In-plan surveillance for pediatric ventilator -associated pneumonia (pedVAP ) using the criteria found in this chapter is restricted to patients of any age in pediatric locations only (excludes neonatal locations). In-plan surveillance conducted for mechanically - ventilated patients in adult locations (regardless of age) will use t he Ventilator -Associated Event (VAE) protocol (see VAE chapter). The PNEU definitions are still available for those units seeking to conduct off-plan PNEU surveillance for mechanically -ventilated adult, pediatric , and neonatal patients and non -ventilated adult, pediatric , and neonatal patients . The PNEU definitions are also available for secondary bloodstream infection assignment when performing Central Line -Associated Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI) surveillance in ventilated or non -ventilated patients of any age in any location. A complete listing of inpatient locations and instructions for mapping can be found in Chapter 15 CDC Locations and Descriptions . Note : Post -discharge surveillance for pedVAPs is not required. However, if discovered, a ny pedVAP s with a date of event (DOE) on the day of discharge or day after discharge is attributed to the discharging location and should be included in any pedVAP s reported to NHSN by the discharging location . No additional ventilator days are reported. Key Terms and Abbreviations Refer to the NHSN Patient Safety Manual, Chapter 2 Identifying Healthcare -associated Infections (HAI) for NHSN Surveillance and Chapter 16 General Key Terms for definitions of the following universal concepts for conducting HAI surveillance. I Date of event (DOE) II Healthcare associated infection (HAI) III Infection window period (IWP) IV Present on admission (POA) V Repeat infection timeframe (RIT) VI Secondary BSI attribution period (SBAP) VII Location of a ttribution (LOA) VIII Transfer rule January 2023 Device -associated Module PNEU Events 6 - 3 Definitions Specific to PNEU/VAP Surveillance Pneumonia (PNEU) is identified by using a combination of imaging , clinical , and laborat ory criteria. The following pages detail the various criteria that may be used for meeting the surveillance definition of healthcare -associated pneumonia (Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4 and Figures 1 and 2), general comments applicable to all site -specific criteria, and reporting instructions. Table 5 shows threshold values for cultured specimens used in the surveillance diagnosis of pneumonia. Ventilator : Any device used to support, assist , or control respiration (inclusive of the weaning period) through the application of positive pressure to the airway when de livered via an artificial airway, specifically an oral/nasal endotracheal or tracheostomy tube. Ventilation and lung expansion devices that deliver positive pressure to the airway (for example , CPAP, BiPAP , Bi-level, IPPB (for example , nasal prongs, nasal mask, full face mask, total mask, etc.) are not considered ventilators unless positive pressure is delivered via an artificial airway ( oral/nasal endotracheal or tracheostomy tube) . Ventilator -associated pneumonia (VAP) : A pneumonia where the patient is on mechanical ventilation for > 2 consecutive calendar days on the date of event, with day of ventilator placement being Day 1,* AND the ventilator was in place on the date of event or the day before. *If the ventilator was in place prior to inpatient admission, the ventilator day count begins with the admission date to the first inpatient location. If a break in mechanical ventilation occurs for at least one full calendar day, ventilator day count for ventilator association starts anew upon reintubation and/or re -initiation of mechanical ventilation. Guidance for Determination of Eligible Imaging Test Evidence If only one imaging test is available, it is ac ceptable for this to satisfy the imaging requirement for PNEU/VAP POA determinations regardless of whether the patient has underlying pulmonary or cardiac disease. When multiple imaging test results are available, persistence of imaging test evidence of pneumonia is a requirement for all patients , not just those with underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease. All elements of PNEU/VAP definition must be present within the Infection Window Period (IWP). The exception may occur w hen identifying persistence of imaging test evidence of pneumonia, as the second imaging test must occur within seven days of the first but is not required to occur within the IWP . The date of the first eligible imaging test will be utilized when determining if the PNEU/VAP criteria are met within the IWP. January 2023 Device -associated Module PNEU Events 6 - 4 General Comments Applicable to All Pneumonia Specific Site Criteria 1. Physician's diagnosis of pneumonia alone is not an acceptable criterion fo r present on admission (POA ) or healthcare -associated ( HAI) pneumonia. 2. Although specific criteria are included for infants and children and immunocompromised patients , all patients may meet any of the other pneumonia site -specific criteria. 3. Pneumonia due to gross aspiration (for example, in the setting of intubation in the field, emergency department, or operating room) that meets the PNEU/VAP definition with a date of event during the HAI timeframe is considered healthcare -associated. 4. Multiple episodes of healthcare-associated pneumonia may occur in critically ill patients with lengthy hospital stays. When determining whether to report multiple episodes of healthcare - associated pneumonia in a single patient, follow the Repeat Infection Timeframe (RIT) guidance found in Chapter 2 . 5. Excluded organisms that cannot be used to meet the PNEU /VAP definition are as follows: flora,\" \"altered oral flora ,\" or other similar results indicating isolation of commensal flora of the oral cavity or upper respiratory tract b. The following organisms , unless identified from lung tissue or pleural fluid (where specimen was obtained during thoracentesis or within 24 hours of chest tube placement; pleural fluid specimens collected after a chest tube is repositioned or from a chest tube in place > 24 hours are not eligible ): i. Any Candida species as well as a report of \"yeast \" that is not otherwise specified ii. Any coagulase -negative Staphylococcus species iii. Any Enterococcus species 6. If the excluded pathogens, any Candida species* or yeast not otherwise specified, any coagulase -negative Staphylococcus species, and any Enterococcus species , are identified from blood they can only be attributed as a secondary BSI to PNEU if PNU2 or PNU3 is met with a matching organism identified from lung tissue or pleural fluid (where specimen was obtained during thoracentesis or within 24 hours of chest tube placement; pleural fluid specimens collected after a chest tube is repositioned or from a chest tube in place > 24 hours are not eligible ) and the blood specimen collection date is within the Secondary BSI Attribution Period (SBAP). *The exception to this is any Candida species or yeast not otherwise specified identified from blood can be attributed as a secondary BSI to PNEU if PNU3 is met using the sputum, endotracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL) brushing with matching Candida species , and both specimens have a collection date in the IWP . 7. Additionally, because organisms belonging to the following genera are typically causes of community -associated infections and are rarely or are not known to be causes of healthcare - associated infections, they are also excluded and cannot be used to meet any Module PNEU Events 6 - 5 8. Abbreviations used in the PNEU laboratory criteria: BAL - bronchoalveolar lavage EIA - enzym e immunoassay IFA - immunofluorescent LRT - lower respiratory tract PMN - polymorphonuclear leukocyte RIA - radioimmunoassay Reporting Instructions There is a hierarchy of specific categories within the major type pneumonia (PNEU) . If the patient meets criteria for more than one specific type during the IWP or the RIT, report only one: o If a patient meets criteria for both PNU1 and PNU2, report PNU2 . o If a patient meets criteria for both PNU2 and PNU3, report PNU3 . o If a patient meets criteria for both PNU1 and PNU3, report PNU3 .

January 2023 Device -associated Module PNEU Events 6 - 12 Footnotes to Algorithms and Flow Diagrams 1. To help confirm difficult cases, multiple imaging test results spanning over several calendar days must be considered when determining if there is imaging test evidence of pneumonia. Pneumonia may have rapid onset and progression but does not resolve quick ly. Imaging test evidence of pneumonia will persist. Rapid imaging resolution suggests that the patient does not have pneumonia, but rather a non -infectious process such as atelectasis or congestive heart failure. The diagnosis of healthcare-associated pne umonia may be quite clear on the basis of signs, symptoms , and a single definitive chest imaging test result. Therefore, in a patient without underlying pulmonary or cardiac disease and when there is only one imaging test available , if the imaging finding is an eligible and definitive finding, the imaging test evidence requirement can be met. In patients without underlying disease , if more than one imaging test is available the serial imaging test results must also be evaluated and must demonstrate persist ence of eligible and definitive findings . In patients with underlying pulmonary or cardiac disease (such as interstitial lung disease, congestive heart failure, etc.), the diagnosis of pneumonia may be particularly difficult. For example, imaging findings of pulmonary edema from decompensated congestive heart fai lure may simulate the presentation of pneumonia. Therefore, in patients with underlying disease, serial chest imaging test results must be examined and must demonstrate persistence of eligible and definitive findings to help separate infectious from non -infectious pulmonary processes. 2. Note that there are many ways of describing the imaging appearance of pneumonia. Examples include, but are not limited to, \"air -space disease ,\" \"focal opacification ,\" \"patchy areas of increased density .\" Although perhaps not specifically delineated as pneu monia by the radiologist, in the appropriate clinical setting these alternative descriptive wordings should be seriously considered as potentially positive findings. If provided and the findings are not documented as attribu ted to another issue (for exampl e, pulmonary edema, chronic lung disease) , they are eligible for meeting imaging test evidence of pneumonia. 3. Purulent sputum is defined as secretions from the lungs, bronchi, or trachea that contain 25 neutrophils and 10 squamous epithelial cells per low power field (x100). Refer to the table below if your laboratory reports these data semi -quantitatively or uses a different format for reporting Gram stain or direct examination results (for example , \"many WBCs\" or \"few squamous epithelial cells\"). This laboratory confirmation is required since written clinical descriptions of purulence are highly variable. January 2023 Device -associated Module PNEU Events 6 - 13 4. Change in character of sputum refers to the color, consistency, odor , and quantity. 5. In adults, tachypnea is defined as respiration rate > 25 breaths per minute. Tachypnea is defined as > 75 breaths per minute in premature infants born at < 37 weeks gestation and until the 40th week; > 60 breaths per minute in patients < 2 months old; > 50 breaths per minute in patients 2 - 12 months old; and > 30 breaths per minute in children > 1 year old. 6. Rales may be described as \"crackles\". How do I use the purulent respiratory secretions criterion if ... Instruction My laboratory reports counts of \"white blood cells\" or \"polymorphonuclear leukocytes\" or \"leukocytes\" rather than counts of \"neutrophils\"? Assume that counts of cells identified by these other descriptors (for example, \"white blood cells\") are equivalent t o counts of neutrophils, unless the laboratory tells you this is not the case. My laboratory reports semi -quantitative results (not quantitative results) for numbers of neutrophils and squamous epithelial cells? Check with the laboratory to get informatio n about what quantitative ranges the semi -quantitative reports correspond to. My laboratory cannot provide additional information on how its semi -quantitative reporting corresponds to quantitative reporting ranges for neutrophils and squamous epithelial c ells? Use the following direct examination results to meet the purulent respiratory secretions criterion: many, heavy, numerous 4+, or 25 neutrophils per low power field (lpf) [x100], AND no, rare, occasional, few, 1+ or 2+, or 10 squamous epithelial c ells per lpf [x100]. My laboratory reports only the numbers of neutrophils present, without reporting the number of squamous epithelial cells? In this situation, the purulent secretions criterion may be met using the specified quantitative and semi - quantitative thresholds for neutrophils alone (specifically many, heavy, numerous, 4+, or 25 neutrophils per lpf [x100]). My laboratory uses different reporting thresholds for neutrophils and squamous epithelial cells (for example , maximum report of 20 neutrophils per low power field [x100], or minimum report of 15 squamous epithelial cells per low power field [x100])? In this situation, the purulent secretions criterion may be met using the laboratory's specified maximum quantitative threshold for neutrophils, and/or minimum quantitative threshold for squamous epithelial cells. My laboratory processes respiratory specimens such as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid using a centrifugation procedure (for example, \"cytospin\"), and there is no quantitation or semi -quantitation of neutrophils or white blood cells in the direct examination report? In this situation, a report indicating the presence of white blood cells, without quantitation, is sufficient to meet the purulent secretions criterion. January 2023 Device -associated Module PNEU Events 6 - 14 7. This measure of arterial oxygenation is defined as the ratio of the arterial tension (PaO 2) to the inspiratory fraction of oxygen (FiO 2). 8. Any c oagulase -negative Staphylococcus species, any Enterococcus species , and any Candida species or yeast not otherwise specified that are identified from blood cannot be deemed secondary to a PNEU event unless the organism was also identified from lung tissue or pleural fluid (where specimen was obtained during thoracentesis or within 24 hours of chest tube placement; a pleural fluid specimen collected after a chest tube is repositioned or from a chest tube in place > 24 hours is not eligible ). This applies when meeting PNU2 or when meeting PNU3 (for patients meeting the immun ocompromised definition) with the laboratory findings found in PNU2. Identification of matching Candida spp. from blood and sputum, endotracheal aspirate, BAL or protected specimen brushing with specimen collection dates in the same IWP (see footnote 11) c an be used to satisfy PNU3 definition for patients meeting the immunocompromised definitio n (see footnote 10). 9. Refer to threshold values for cultured specimens (lung tissue, BAL, protected specimen brushing, or endotracheal aspirate ) with growth of eligibl e pathogens ( Table 5 ). Notes: A specimen that is not obtained through an artificial airway (specifically an endotracheal tube or a tracheostomy) from a ventilated patient is not considered minimally contaminated and is not eligible for use in meeting the laboratory criteria for PNEU (PNU2 or PNU3 when using the laboratory PNU2 ). Sputum or tracheal secretions collecte patient are not minimally -contaminated specimens . The following organisms can only be used to meet PNEU definitions when identified from lung tissue or pleural fluid obtained during thoracentesis or within 24 hours of chest tube placement (not from a chest tube that has been repositioned or from a chest tube that has been in place > 24 hours ): o Any c oagulase -negative Staphylococcus species o Any Enterococcus species o Any Candida species or yeast not otherwise specified. Exception: i dentification of matching Candida spp. from blood and sputum, endotracheal aspirate, BAL , or protected specimen brushing with specimen collection dates in the same IWP can be used to satisfy PNU3 definition for immunocompromised patients (see footnote 10) . 10. Immunocompromised patients include only those with neutropenia defined as absolute neutrophil count or total white blood cell count (WBC) < 500/mm3 those with leukemia, lymphoma , or who are HIV positive with CD4 count < 200 those who have undergone splenectomy those who have a history of solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant those on cytotoxic chemotherapy those on enteral or parenteral administered steroids (exclude s inhaled and topical steroids) daily for > 14 consecutive days on the date of event January 2023 Device -associated Module PNEU Events 6 - 15 11. Blood specimen and respiratory specimen ( sputum, endotracheal aspirate, BAL , or protected specimen brushing) must have a collection date that occurs within the IWP . 12. Semi-quantitative or non -quantitative cultures of sputum obtained by deep cough, induction, aspiration, or lavage are acceptable. 13. Identification of organism by a culture or non -culture based microbiologic testing method which is performed for purposes of cli nical diagnosis or treatment (for example, not Active Surveillance Culture/Testing (ASC/AST) ). 14. If the imaging test result is equivocal for pneumonia, check to see if subsequent imaging tests are definitive. For example, if a chest imaging test result state s infiltrate vs. atelectasis and a subsequent imaging test result is definitive for infiltrate , the initial imaging test would be eligible for use. In the absence of finding a subsequent imaging result that clarifies the equivocal finding, if there is clin ical correlation (see Chapter 16) then the equivocal imaging test is eligible for use. Table 5: Threshold values for cultured specimens used in the diagnosis of pneumonia Specimen collection/technique Values * Lung tissue 104 CFU/g tissue Bronchoscopically (B) obtained specimens Bronchoalveolar lavage (B -BAL) 104 CFU/ml Protected BAL (B -PBAL) Protected specimen brushing (B -PSB) 103 CFU = colony forming units , g = gram, ml = milliliter *Consult with your laboratory to determine if reported semi -quantitative results match the quantitative thresholds. In the absence of additional information available from your laboratory, a semi -quantitative result of \"moderate\" or \"heavy\" 3+ , or 4+ growth is considered to correspond. Lung tissue specimens obtained by either open or closed lung biopsy methods . For post -mortem specimens , only lung tissue specimens obtained by transthoracic or transbronchial biopsy that are collected immediately post -mortem are eligible for use. January 2023 Device -associated Module PNEU Events 6 - 16 Numerator Data The Pneumonia (PNEU) form (CDC 57.111) is used to collect and report each VAP that is identified during the month selected for surveillance. The Instructions for Completion of Pneumonia (PNEU) form contains brief instructions for collection and entry of each data element on the form. The pneumonia form includes patient demographic information and information on whether or not mechanically -assisted ventilation was present. Additional data include the specific criteria met for identifying pneumonia, whether the patient developed a secondary bloodstream infection, whether the patient died, the organisms identified from culture or non -culture based microbiologic testing method s, and the organisms' antimicrobial s usceptibilities. Reporting Instruction: If no VAPs are identified during the month of surveillance, the \" Report No Events \" box must be checked on the appropriate denominator summary screen, for example, Denominators for Intensive Care Unit (ICU)/Other Loc ations (Not NICU or SCA/ONC), etc. Denominator Data Device days and patient days are used for denominators (see Chapter 16 ). Ventilator days, which are the number of patients managed with a ventilatory device, are collected daily, at the same time each day, according to the chosen locati on using the appropriate form ( Locations]). These daily counts are summed and only the total for the month is entered into NHSN . Ventilator days and patient days are collected for each of the locations where VAP is monitored. When denominator data are available from electronic sources, these sources may be used as long as the counts are within +/- 5% of manually -collected counts, validated for a minimum of three consecutive months. Validation o f electronic counts should be performed separately for each location conducting VAP surveillance. When converting from one electronic counting system to another electronic counting system, the new electronic system should be validated against manual counts as above. If electronic counts for the new electronic system are not within 5% of manual counts, resume manual counting and continue working with IT staff to improve design of electronic denominator data extraction (while reporting manual counts) until co ncurrent counts are within 5% for 3 consecutive months. Note: This guideline is important because validating a new electronic counting system against an existing electronic system can magnify errors and result in inaccurate denominator counts. January 2023 Device -associated Module PNEU Events 6 - 17 Data A nalyses All data that is entered into NHSN can be analyzed at event or summary level. The data in NHSN can be visualized and analyzed in various ways, specifically , descriptive analysis reports for both the denominator and numerator data. Types of VAP An alysi s Reports VAP Rate The VAP rate per 1000 ventilator days is calculated by dividing the number of VAPs by the number of ventilator days and multiplying the result by 1000 (ventilator days) . VAP Rate per 1000 ventilator days = . . * 1000 Device Utilization Ratio The Ventilator Utilization Ratio is calculated by dividing the number of ventilator days by the number of patient days.

CAUTI Measures Available in NHSN .............................................................................................. 17 References .................................................................................................................................................. 18 Introduction Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the fifth most common type of healthcare -associated infection, with an estimated 62,700 UTIs in acute care hospitals in 2015. UTIs additionally account for more than 9.5% of infections reported by acute care hospitals1. Virtually all healthcare -associated UTIs are caused by instrumentation of the urinary tract. Approximately 12%-16% of adult hospital inpatients will have an indwelling urinary catheter (IUC) at some time during their hospitalization, and each day the indwelling urinary catheter remains, a patient has a 3%-7% increased risk of acquiring a catheter -associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI).2-3 CAUTI can lead to such complications as prostatitis, in patients. Complications associated with CAUTI cause discomfort to the patient, prolonged hospital stay, and increased cost and mortality 4. It has been estimated that each year, more than 13,000 deaths are associated with UTIs.5 Prevention of CAUTI is discussed in the CDC/HICPAC document, Guideline for Prevention of Catheter - associated Urinary Tract Infection .6 January 2023 Device -associated Module UTI 7 - 2 Settings : Surveillance may occur in any inpatient l ocation(s) where denominator data can be collected, such as critical intensive care units (ICU), specialty care areas (SCA), step - down units, wards, inpatient rehabilitation locations, and long term acute care locations. Neonatal ICUs may participate, but only off plan (not as a part of their monthly reporting plan). A complete listing of inpatient locations and instructions for mapping are located in the CDC Locati ons and Descriptions chapter. Note: Post -discharge Surveillance for CAUTI is not required. However, if discovered, any CAUTI with a date of event (DOE) on the day of discharge or the next day is attributable to the discharging location and should be in cluded in any CAUTIs reported to NHSN for that location (see Transfer Rule Chapter 2 ). No additional indwelling urinary catheter days are reported. Refer to the NHSN Patient Safety Manual, Chapter 2 Identifying Healthcare Associated Infections in NHSN and Chapter 16 NHSN Key Terms for definitions of the following universal concepts for conducting HAI surveillance. I. Date of event (DOE) II. Healthcare associated infection (HAI) III. Infection window period (IWP) IV. Present on admission (POA) V. Repeat infection timeframe (RIT) VI. Secondary BSI attribution period (SBAP) VII. Location of Attribution (LOA) VIII. Transfer rule Definitions : Urinary tract infections (UTI) are defined using Symptomatic Urinary Tract Infection (SUTI) criteria, and Asymptomatic Bacteremic UTI (ABUTI) . (See Table 1 ) Note : UTI is a primary site of infection; it is never considered secondary to another site of infection. Indwelling Urinary C atheter (IUC) : A drainage tube that is inserted into the urinary bladder through the urethra, is left in place, and is connected to a drainage bag (including leg bags). These devices are also often called Foley catheters. Indwelling urinary catheters (IUC) that are use d for intermittent or continuous irrigation are also included in CAUTI surveillance. Condom or straight in -and -out catheters are not included nor are nephrostomy tubes, ileoconduits, or suprapubic catheters unless an (IUC is also present. Catheter -associated UTI (CAUTI) : A UTI where an indwelling urinary catheter was in place for more than two consecutive days in an inpatient location on the date of event , with day of device placement being Day 1*, January 2023 Device -associated Module UTI 7 - 3 AND an indwelling urinary catheter was in place on the dat e of event or the day before. If an indwelling urinary catheter was in place for more than two consecutive days in an inpatient location and then removed, the date of event for the UTI must be the day of device discontinuation or the next day for the UTI t o be catheter -associated. *If the IUC was in place prior to inpatient admission, the catheter day count that determines device -association begins with the admission date to the first inpatient location. This allows for consistency with device denominato r count (see Table 2 Denominator Data Collection Methods ) Example of Associating Catheter Use to UTI: A patient in an inpatient unit has an IUC inserted, and the following day is the date of event for a UTI. Becaus e the IUC has not been in place for more than two consecutive days in an inpatient location on the date of event, this is not a CAUTI. However, depending on the date of admission, this may be a healthcare -associated UTI and sets an RIT. Please refer to SUT I 1b: Non urinary that are removed and reinserted: If, after an IUC removal, the patient is without an IUC for at least 1 full calendar day (NOT to be read as 24 hours), then the IUC day count will start anew. If instead, a new IUC is inserted b efore a full calendar day has passed, the indwelling urinary catheter device day count, to determine eligibility for a CAUTI, will continue uninterrupted. Figure 1: Associating Catheter Use to UTI March 31 (Hospital day 3) April 1 April 2 April 3 April 4 April 5 April 6 Patient A IUC Day 3 IUC Day 4 IUC d/c'd (IUC Day IUC replaced (IUC Day 6) IUC Day 7 IUC removed Day 8 No IUC Patient B IUC Day 3 IUC Day 4 IUC removed (IUC Day 5) No IUC IUC replaced (IUC Day 1) IUC Day 2 IUC Day 3 January 2023 Device -associated Module UTI 7 - 4 Rationale: NHSN surveillance for infection is not aimed at a specific device ; surveillance is aimed at identifying risk to the patient that is the result of device use in general. Notes: In the examples above, Patient A is eligible for a CAUTI beginning on March 31, through April 6th, since an IUC was in place for some portion of each calendar day until April 6th. A UTI with date of event on April 6th would be a CAUTI since the IUC had been in place greater than two days and was removed the day before the date of event. Patient B is eligible for a CAUTI on March 31 (IUC Day 3) through April 3. The IUC had been in place for greater than two days an d a HAI occurring on the day of device discontinuation or the following calendar day is considered a device -associated infection. If the patient B did not have a CAUTI by April 3, the patient is not eligible for a CAUTI until April 6, when the second IUC had been in place for greater than two days. January 2023 Device -associated Module UTI 7 - 5 Table 1. Urinary Tract Infection Criteria Criterion Urinary Tract Infection (U TI) Symptomatic UTI (SUTI) Must meet at least one of the following criteria: SUTI 1a Catheter - associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI) in any age patient Patient must meet 1, 2, and 3 below: 1. Patient had an indwelling urinary catheter that had been in place for more than 2 consecutive days in an inpatient location on the date of event AND was either: Present for any portion of the calendar day on the date of event, OR Removed the day before the date of event 2. Patient has at least one of the following signs or symptoms: fever (>38.0\u00b0C ) suprapubic ^ urinary frequency ^ dysuria ^ 3. Patient has a urine culture with no more than two species of organisms identified, at leas t one of which is a bacterium of 105 CFU/ml (See Comment s). All elements of the SUTI criterion must occur during the IWP (See IWP Definition Chapter 2 Identifying HA Is in NHSN). When entering event into NHSN choose \"INPLACE\" for Risk Factor for IUC When entering event into NHSN choose \"REMOVE\" for Ri sk Factor for IUC *With no other recognized cause (see Comments ) ^ These symptoms cannot be used when catheter is in place. An IUC in place could cause patient complaints of \"frequency\" \"urgency\" or \"dysuria\". Note: Fever is a non-specific symptom of infection and cannot be excluded from UTI determination because it is clinically deemed due to another recognized cause. January 2023 Device -associated Module UTI 7 - 6 SUTI 1b Non- Catheter - associated Urinary Tract Infection (Non- CAUTI) in any age patient Patient must meet 1, 2, and 3 below: 1. One of the following is true: Patient has/had an indwelling urinary catheter, but it has/had not been in place for more than two consecutive days in an inpatient location on the date of event OR Patient did not have an indwelling urinary catheter in place on the date of event nor the day before the date of event 2. Patient has at least one of the following signs or symptoms: fever (>38\u00b0C) suprapubic tenderness * costovertebral angle pain or tenderness * urinary frequency ^ urinary urgency ^ dysuria ^ 3. Patient has a urine culture with no more than two species of organisms identified, at least one of which is a bacterium of 10 5 CFU/ml. (See C omments ) All elements of the SUTI criterion must occur during the IWP (See IWP Definition Chapter 2 Identifying HAIs in NHSN). When entering event into NHSN choose \"NEITHER\" for Risk Factor for IUC *With no other recognized cause (see Comments ) ^These symptoms cannot be used when IUC is in place. An IUC in place could cause patient complaints of \"frequency\" \"urgency\" or \"dysuria\". Note: Fever is a non-specific symptom of infection and cannot be excluded from UTI dete rmination because it is clinically deemed due to another recognized cause. January 2023 Device -associated Module UTI 7 - 7 SUTI 2 CAUTI or Non-CAUTI in patients 1 year of age or less Patient must meet 1, 2, and 3 below: 1. Patient is 1 year of age ( with or without an indwelling urinary catheter) 2. Patient has at least one of the following signs or symptoms: fever (>38.0\u00b0C) hypothermia vomiting* suprapubic tenderness* 3. Patient has a urine culture with no more than two species of organisms identified, at least one of which is a bacterium of 105 CFU/ml. (See Comments ) All elements of the SUTI criterion must occur during the IWP (See IWP Definition Chapter 2 Identifying HAIs in NHSN). If patient had an IUC in place for more than two consecutive days in an inpatient location and the IUC was in place on the date of event or the previous day the CAUTI criterion is met. If no such IUC was in place, UTI (non -catheter associated) criterion is met. *With no other recognized cause (See Comment s) Note: Fever and hypothermia are non -specific symptoms of infection and cannot be excluded from UTI determination because they are clinically deemed due to another recognized cause. January 2023 Device -associated Module UTI 7 - 8 Comments \"Mixed flora\" is not available in the pathogen list within NSHN. Therefore, it cannot be reported as a pathogen to meet the NHSN UTI criteria. Additionally, \"mixed flora\" represent at least two species of organisms. Therefore, an additional organism recove red from the same culture would represent more than two species of microorganisms. Such a specimen also cannot be used to meet the UTI criteria. The following excluded organisms cannot be used to meet the UTI definition: Any Candida species as well as a report of \"yeast\" that is not otherwise specified mold dimorphic fungi or parasites An acceptable urine specimen may include these organisms if one bacterium of > 100,000 CFU/ml is also present. Additionally, these non-bacterial organisms identified from blood cannot be deemed secondary to a UTI since they are excluded as organisms in the UTI definition. Suprapubic tenderness whether elicited by palpation (tenderness -sign) or provided as a subjective complaint of suprapubic pain (pain -sympt om), documentation of either found in the medical record is acceptable as a part of SUTI criterion if documented in the medical record during the Infection Window Period. Lower abdominal pain or bladder or pelvic discomfort are examples of symptoms that ca n be used as suprapubic tenderness. Generalized \"abdominal pain\" in the medical record is not to be interpreted as suprapubic tenderness as there are many causes of abdominal pain and this symptom is too general. Left or right lower back or flank pain are examples of symptoms that can be used as costovertebral angle pain or tenderness. Generalized \"low back pain\" is not to be interpreted as costovertebral angle pain or tenderness . January 2023 Device -associated Module UTI 7 - 9 Asymptomatic Bacteremic Urinary Tract Infection (ABUTI) (in any age patient) Patient must meet 1, 2, and 3 below: 1. Patient with * or without an indwelling urinary catheter has no signs or symptoms of SUTI 1 or 2 according to age. 2. Patient has a urine culture with no more than two species of organisms identified, at least one of which is a bacterium of 105 CFU/ml (see Comment section below) . 3. Patient has organism identified** from blood specimen with at least one matching bacterium to the bacterium at > 100,000 CFU/ml identified in the urine specimen, or is eligible L CBI criterion 2 (without fever) and matching common commensal(s) in the urine. All elements of the ABUTI criterion must occur during the Infection Window Period (See Definition Chapter 2 Identifying HAIs in NHSN). *Patient had an IUC in place for more than two consecutive days in an inpatient location on the date of event, and IUC was in place on the date of event or the day before. Catheter - associated ABUTI is reportable if CAUTI is in the facility's reporting plan for the location. ** Organisms identified by a culture or non -culture based microbiologic testing method which is performed for purposes of clinical diagnosis or treatment (e.g., not Active Surveilla nce Culture/Testing (ASC/AST). Comments A urine specimen with \"Mixed flora\" cannot be used to meet the urine criterion. Additionally, the following excluded organisms cannot be used to meet the UTI definition: Any Candida species as well as a report of \"yeast\" that is not otherwise specified mold dimorphic fungi or parasites An acceptable urine specimen may include these excluded organisms if one bacterium of >100,000 CFU/ml is also present. Additionally, these non-bacterial organisms identified from blood cannot be deemed secondary to a UTI since they are excluded as organisms in the UTI definition January 2023 Device -associated Module UTI 7 - 10 January 2023 Device -associated Module UTI 7 - 11 Monthly Summary Data Numerator Data: The Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) form (CDC 57.114) is used to collect and report each CAUTI that is identified during the month selected for surveillance. The Instructions for Completion of Urinary Tract Infection f orm include brief instruction s for collection and entry of each data element on the form. The UTI form includes patient demographic information and information on whether an indwelling urinary catheter was present. Additional data include the specific criteria met for identifying th e UTI, whether the patient developed a secondary bloodstream infection, whether the patient died, and the organisms isolated from cultures and their antimicrobial susceptibilities. Reporting Instructions: If no CAUTIs are identified during the month of surveillance, the \"Report No Events\" box must be checked on the appropriate denominator summary screen, ( for example, Denom inators for Intensive Care Unit (ICU)/ Other Locations (Not NICU or SCA/ONC ). Denominator Data: Device days and patient days are used for denominators (See Key Terms chapter ).The method of collecting device -day denominator dat a may differ depending on the location of patients being monitored. The following methods may be used: Table 2: Denominator Data Collection Methods Denominator Data Collection Method Details Manual, Daily (specifically, collected at the same time every day of the month) Denominator data (patient days and device days) should be collected at the same time, every day, for each location performing surveillance to ensure that differing collection methods don't inadvertently result in device days being greater than patient days. The Instructions for Completion of Denominators for Intensive Care Unit (ICU)/Other Locations (Not NICU and SC A/ONC) and Instructions for Completion of Denominators for Specialty Care Areas (SCA)/Oncology (ONC ) contain brief instructions for collection and entry of each data element on the form. Indwelling urinary catheter days, which are the number of pa tients with an indwelling urinary catheter device, are collected daily, at the same time each day, according to the chosen location using the appropriate form (CDC 57.117 and 57.118). These daily counts are summed and only the total for the month is entered into NHSN. Indwelling urinary catheter days and patient days are collected separately for each of the locations monitored. January 2023 Device -associated Module UTI 7 - 12 Denominator Data Collection Method Details Manual, sampled once/week (collected at the same time on the same designated day, once per week ) To reduce staff time spent collecting surveillance data, once weekly sampling of denominator data to generate estimated urinary catheter days may be used as an alternative to daily collection in non-oncology ICUs and wards (see Notes below). Sampling may not be used in SCA/ONC locations or NICUs. During the month, the number of patients in the location (patient-days) and t he number of patients with an indwelling urinary catheter (urinary catheter- days) is collected on a designated day each week (for example, every Tuesday), at the same time during the month. Evaluations of this method have repeatedly shown that use of Sat urday or Sunday generate the least accurate estimates of denominator data, and, therefore, these days should not be selected as the designated day. 7-9 If the day designated for the collection of sampled data is missed, collect the data on the next availabl e day instead. The following must be collected and entered NHSN: 1. The monthly total for patient -days, based on collection daily 2. The sampled total for patient -days 3. The sampled total urinary catheter -days When these data are entered, the NHSN application will calculate an estimate of urinary catheter -days. Notes: To ensure the accuracy of estimated denominator data obtained by sampling, only ICU and ward location types with an average of 75 or more urinary catheter-days per month are eligible to use this method. A review of each location's urinary catheter denominator data for the past 12 months in NHSN will help determine which locations are eligible. The accuracy of estimated denominator data generated by sampling can be heavily influenced by i ncorrect or missing data. Careful implementation of data collection following the guidance in this protocol is essential to avoid erroneous fluctuations in rates or Standardized Infection Ratios (SIRs). January 2023 Device -associated Module UTI 7 - 13 Denominator Data Collection Method Details Electronic For any location, denominator data from electronic sources (for example, urinary catheter days from electronic charting), may be used after validation of a minimum three consecutive months proves the data to be within 5% (+/ -) of the manually -collected, once a day counts. Perform the validation of electronic counts separately for each location conducting CAUTI surveillance. When converting from one electronic counting system to another electronic counting system, the new electronic system should be validated against manual counts as above. If el ectronic counts for the new electronic system are not within 5% of manual counts, resume manual counting and continue working with IT staff to improve design of electronic denominator data extraction (while reporting manual counts) until concurrent counts are within 5% for 3 consecutive months. Note: This guideline is important because validating a new electronic counting system against an existing electronic system can magnify errors and result in inaccurate denominator counts. January 2023 Device -associated Module UTI 7 - 14 Data Analyses All data that is entered into NHSN can be analyzed at event or summary level. The data in NHSN can be visualized and analyzed in various ways, for example, descriptive analysis reports for both the denominator and numerator data. Types of CAUTI Analysis Reports Standardized Infection Ratio The Standardized Infection Ratio ( SIR) is a summary measure used to track HAIs at a national, state, or local level over time. The SIR adjusts for various facility and/or patient -level factors that contribute to HAI risk within each facility. In HAI data analysis, the SIR compares the actual number of HAIs reported to the number that would be predicted, given the standard population (i.e., NHSN baseline), adjusting for several risk factors that have been fo und to be significantly associated with differences in infection incidence. The number of predicted infections is calculated using probabilities from negative binomial regression models constructed from 2015 NHSN data. For more information on SIR and the C AUTI parameter estimates, please the SIR sir-guide.pdf SIR = () () An SIR greater than 1.0 indicates that more HAIs were observed than predicted; conversely, a n SIR less than 1.0 indicates that fewer HAIs were observed than predicted. While the CAUTI SIR can be calculated for single locations, the me asure also allows you to summarize your data by multiple locations, adjusting for differences in the incidence of infection among the location types. For example, you will be able to obtain one CAUTI SIR adjusting for all locations reported. Similarly, you can obtain one CAUTI SIR for all ICUs in your facility. For m ore information on using the CAUTI SIR reports, please see the troubleshooting guide: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/ps -analysis-resources/clabsicauti_sirtroubleshooting.pdf . For further information regarding the p -value and 95% confidence interval, please the following guide: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/ps -analysis-resources/keys -to-success.html Note: The SIR will be calculated only if the number of predicted CAUTIs (numPred) is 1 to help enforce a minimum precision criterion. January 2023 Device -associated Module UTI 7 - 15 The Standardized Utilization Ratio (SUR) The SUR , or Standardized Utilization Ratio is a summary measure used to track device use at a national, state, or local, or facility level over time. The SUR adjusts for various facility and/or location -level factors that contribute to device use. The method of calculating a n SUR is similar to the method used to calculate the Standardized Infection Ratio (SIR), a summary statistic used in NHSN to track healthcare -associated infections (HAIs). In device-associated HAI data analysis, the SUR compares the actual numb er of device days reported to what would be predicted, given the standard population (specifically, the NHSN baseline), adjusting for several factors that have been found to be significantly associated with differences in device utilization. SUR = () () In other words, a n SUR greater than 1.0 indicates that more device days were observed than predicted; conversely, a n SUR less than 1.0 indicates that fewer device days wer e observed than predicted. SURs are currently calculated in NHSN for the following device types: central lines, urinary catheters, and ventilators. More information regarding the CAUTI SUR model and the parameter estimates CAUTI rate per 1000 urinary catheter days is calculated by dividing the number of CAUTIs by the number of catheter days and multiplying the result by 1000. CAUTI Rate = . . * 1000 Device Utilization Ratio The Urinary Catheter Utilization Ratio is calculated by dividing the number of urinary catheter days by the number of patient days. DUR = . . These calculations will be performed separately for the different types of ICUs, specialty care areas, and other locations in the institution, except for neonatal locations. DURs are useful for the purposes of tracking device use over shorter periods of time and for internal tre nd analyses. January 2023 Device -associated Module UTI 7 - 16 Descriptive Analysis Descriptive analysis output options of numerator and denominator data, such as line listings, frequency tables, and bar and pie charts are available in the NHSN application.

Based on the 2021 HAI data results published in the NHSN's HAI Progress Report, about a 3% increase in the SSI standardized infection ratio (SIR) related to all NHSN operative procedure categories combined compared to the previous year was reported in 202 1. No significant changes in SIR related to the Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) NHSN operative procedure categories compared to the previous year was reported in 202 12. While advances have been made in infection control practices, including improved operating room venti lation, sterilization methods, barriers, surgical technique, and availability of antimicrobial prophylaxis, SSIs remain a substantial cause of morbidity, prolonged January 2023 Procedure-associated Module SSI Events 9 - 2 hospitalization, and death. It is reported, SSI accounts for 20% of all HAIs and is associat ed to a 2- to 11- fold increase in the risk of mortality with 75% of SSI- associated deaths directly attributable to the SSI3,4. SSI is the most costly HAI type with an estimated annual cost of $3.3 billion, and extends hospital length of stay by 9.7 days, with cost of hospitalization increased by more than $20,000 per admission3,5. Surveillance of SSI with feedback of appropriate data to surgeons has been shown to be an important component of strategies to re duce SSI risk6-9. A successful surveillance program includes the use of epidemiologically -sound infection definitions and effective surveillance methods, stratification of SSI rates according to risk factors associated with SSI development, and data feedba ck7,8. The most recent CDC and Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee Guideline for the Prevention of Surgical Site Infection was published in 2017; this guideline provides evidence -based strategies for SSI prevention 9. Settings : Surveillance of surgical patients will occur in any inpatient facility and/or hospital outpatient procedure department (HOPD) where the selected NHSN operative procedure(s) are performed. Note: Ambulatory Surgery Centers (ASCs) should use the Outpatient Procedure Component (OPC) to perform SSI surveillance . Requirements: Perform surveillance for SSI following at least one NHSN operative procedure category (using the associated NHSN operative procedure codes) as indicated in the Patient Safety Monthly Reporting Plan (CDC 57.106 ). Collect SSI event (numerator) and operative procedure (denominator) data on all procedures included in the selected operative procedure categories indicated on the facility's monthly reporting plan. All procedures included in the NHSN monthly surveillance plan are monitored for superficial incisional, deep incisional, and organ/space SSI events and the type of SSI reported must reflect the deepest tis sue level where SSI criteria are met during the surveillance period. Events meeting SSI criteria are reported to NHSN regardless of noted evidence of infection at time of surgery . An SSI event is attributed to the facility in which the NHSN operative procedure is performed. January 2023 Procedure-associated Module SSI Events 9 - 3 Surveillance Methods: SSI monitoring requires active, patient -based, prospective surveillance. C oncurrent and post- discharge surveillance methods should be used to detect SSIs following inpatient and outpatient operative procedures . For example, these methods include: Review of medical records or surgery clinic patient records o Admission, readmission, ED, and OR logs o Patient charts for signs and symptoms of SSI Acceptable documentation includes patient- report ed signs or symptoms within the SSI surveillance period, documented in the medical record by a healthcare professional. o Lab, imaging, other diagnostic test reports o Clinician /healthcare professional notes o ICD-10-CM Infection Diagnosis Codes to prompt furthe r review Visit the ICU and wards - talk to primary care staff Surgeon surveys by mail or telephone Patient surveys by mail or telephone (though patients may have a difficult time assessing their infections). Any combination of these methods (or other methods identified by the facility) with the capacity to identify all SSIs is acceptable for use; however, NHSN criteria for SSI must be used. To minimize Infection Preventionists' (IPs) workload of collecting denominator data, operating room data may be imported . (See file specifications at: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/ps- analysis -resources/ImportingProcedureData.pdf ). Operative Procedure Codes: Opera tive procedure codes are used in health care settings to communicate uniform information. This wide use of operative procedure codes allows NHSN to incorporate the operative procedure codes to standardize NHSN SSI surveillance reporting. The operative proc edure codes are required to determine the correct NHSN operative procedure category to be reported. NHSN uses the following operative procedure coding systems: International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision Clinical Modifications/Procedure Coding System (ICD -10-CM/PCS), as defined by the ICD -10 Coordination and Maintenance Committee of the National Center for Health Statistics and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). January 2023 Procedure-associated Module SSI Events 9 - 4 Current Proced ural Terminology (CPT), as defined by the American Medical Association (AMA). The mapping for ICD -10-PCS and CPT NHSN operative procedures is found in the \" Operative Procedure Code Documents \" section of the Surgical Site Infection (SSI) Events page on the NHSN website. The mapping documents include a general definition for each NHSN operative procedure category as well as a description for each individual operative procedure code. Entering the operative procedure code into the NHSN application remains optional but is recommended . Note: For in -plan reporting purposes, only NHSN operative procedures are included in SSI surveillance. An infection associated with a procedure that is not included in one of the NHSN operative procedure categories is not considered an NHSN SSI, although the infection may be investigated as a HAI. SSI events can only be attributed to NHSN operative procedures. Definition of an NHSN Operative Procedure: An NHSN Operative Procedure is a procedure: that is included in the ICD -10-PCS and/or CPT NHSN operative procedure code mapping And takes place during an operation where at least one incision (including laparoscopic approach and cranial Burr holes) is made through the skin or mucous membrane, or entry is through an existing incision ( such as an incision from a prior operative procedure ) And takes place in an operating room (OR), defined as a patient care area that met the Facilities Guidelines Institute's (FGI) or American Institute of Architects' (AIA) criteria for an operating room when it was constructed or renovated 10. This may include an operating room, C -section room, interventional radiology room, or a cardiac catheterization lab. January 2023 Procedure-associated Module SSI Events 9 - 5 SSI Event Details The infection window period (IWP), present on a dmission (POA), healthcare -associated infection (HAI), and repeat infection timeframe (RIT) definitions do not apply to the SSI protocol. For additional POA details, see SSI Event Reporting Instruction #2 . For details related to infection present at time of surgery (PATOS) see SSI Event Reporting Instruction #3. Surveillance Period for SSI: The timeframe following an NHSN operative procedure for monitoring and identifying an SSI event. The surveillance period is determined by the NHSN operative procedure category (for example, COLO has a 30 -day SSI surveillance period and KPRO has a 90 -day SSI surveillance period , see Table 2 ). Superficial incisional SSIs are monitored for a 30 -day period for all procedure types. Secondary incisional SSIs are monitored for a 30 -day period regardless of the surveillance period for the primary site. Each trip to the OR for an NHSN operative procedure sets an SSI surveillance period for the surgical site . Non- NHSN operative procedures do not set an SSI surveillance period. If a patient returns to the OR for an NHSN operative procedure and the same surgical site is entered , the surveillance period for the prior NHSN operative procedure ends and a new SSI surveillance period begins. If within the surveillance period following an NHSN operative procedure a non-NHSN operative procedure is performed , and all three tissue levels are entered, the SSI surveillance period for the NHSN operative procedure end s. If all three tissue levels are not entered, the SSI surveillance period continues for the tissue levels not entered during the non- NHSN operative procedure. Date of E vent (DOE) for SSI : For an SSI, the DOE is the date when the first element used to meet the SSI infection criterion occurs for the first time during the SSI surveillance period. The DOE must fall within the SSI surveillance period to meet SSI criteria. The type of SSI (superficial incisional, d eep incisional, or organ/space) reported and the DOE assigned must reflect the deepest tissue level where SSI criteria are met during the surveillance period. Synonym: infection date. Timeframe for SSI elements: SSI guidelines do not offer a strict timeframe for elements of criteria to occur but in NHSN's experience, all elements required to meet an SSI criterion usually occur within a 7 -10 day timeframe with typically no more than 2 -3 days between elements. To ensure that all elements associate to the S SI, the elements must occur in a relatively tight timeframe. For example, an January 2023 Procedure-associated Module SSI Events 9 - 6 element that occurs on day 2 of the surveillance period with another element that occurs three weeks later should not be used to cite an SSI. Each case differs based on the individual elements occurring and the type of SSI but the DOE for an SSI must occur within the appropriate 30 - or 90- day SSI surveillance period. Secondary BSI Scenarios for SSI : For purposes of NHSN reporting, for a bloodstream infection to be determined secondary to an SSI the following requirements must be met: Scenario 1: At least one organism from the blood specimen matches an organism identified from the site -specific specimen that is used as an element to meet the NHSN SSI criterion AND the blood specimen is collected during the secondary BSI attribution period . The secondary BSI attribution period for SSI is a 17 -day period that includes the SSI DOE , 3 days prior, and 13 days after. OR Scenario 2 [Organ/ Space SSI Only] : An organism identified in the blood specimen is an element that is used to meet the NHSN Organ/Space SSI site -specific infection criterion and is collected during the timeframe for SSI elements . For detailed instructions on determining whether identification of organisms from a blood specimen represents a secondary BSI, refer to the Secondary BSI Guide (Appendix B o f the BSI Event Protocol ). January 2023 Procedure-associated Module SSI Events 9 - 7 Denominator for Procedure Details Additional guidance can be found within the Instructions for Completion of Denominator for Procedure Form ( CDC 57.121). ASA physical status: Assessment by the anesthesiologist of the patient's preoperative physical condition using the American Society of Anesthesiologists' (ASA) Physical Status Classification System11. Patients are assigned an ASA score of 1 -6 at time of surgery. Patients with an ASA score of 1 -5 are eligible for NHSN SSI surveillance. Patients that are assigned an ASA score of 6 ( a declared brain -dead patient whose organs are being removed for donor purposes ) are not eligible for NHSN SSI surveillance. Diabetes: The NHSN SSI surveillance definition of diabetes indicates that the patient has a diagnosis of diabetes requiring management with insulin or a non -insulin anti -diabetic agent. This includes: Patients with \"insulin resistance\" who are on management with anti -diabetic agents. Patients with gestational diabetes. Patients who are noncompliant with their diabetes medications. The ICD -10-CM diagnosis codes that reflect the diagnosis of diabetes are also acceptable for use to answer YES to the diabetes field question on the denominator for procedure entry if they are documented during the admission where the procedure is performed. These codes are found on the Surgical Site Infection (SSI) Events page section of the NHSN website under \" Operative Procedure Code Documents \". The NHSN definition of diabetes excludes patients with no diagnosis of diabetes. The definition also excludes patients who receive insulin for perioperative control of hyperglycemia but have no diagnosis of diabetes. Duration of operative procedure: The interval in hours and minutes between the Procedure/Surgery Start Time and the Procedure/Surgery Finish Time, as defined by the Association of Anesthesia Clinical Directors (AACD) 12: Procedure/Surgery Start Time (PST): Time the procedure is begun (for example, incision for a surgical procedure). Procedure/Surgery Finish (PF): Time when all instrument and sponge count are completed and verified as correct, all postoperative radiologic studies to be done in the OR are completed, all dressings and drains are secured, and the physicians/surgeons have completed all procedure -related activities on the patient. January 2023 Procedure-associated Module SSI Events 9 - 8 Emergency operative procedure: A procedure that is documented per the facility's protocol to be an Emergency or Urgent procedure. Genera l anesthesia: The administration of drugs or gases that enter the general circulation and affect the central nervous system to render the patient pain free, amnesic, unconscious, and often paralyzed with relaxed muscles. This does not include conscious se dation. Height: The patient's most recent height documented in the medical record in feet (ft.) and inches (in.), or meters (m). NHSN Inpatient Operative Procedure: An NHSN operative procedure performed on a patient whose date of admission to the healthcare facility and the date of discharge are different calendar days. NHSN Outpatient Operative Procedure: An NHSN operative procedure performed on a patient whose date of admission to the healthcare facility and date of discharge are the same calendar day. Non -primary Closure: The closure of the surgical wound in a way which leaves the skin level completely open following the surgery. Closure of any portion of the skin represents primary closure (see Primary Closure definition below). For surgeries with non- primary closure, the deep tissue layers may be closed by some means (with the skin level left open), or the deep and superficial layers may both be left completely open. Wounds with non- primary closure may or may not be described as \"packed\" with gauze or other material, and may or may not be covered with plastic, \"wound vacs,\" or other synthetic devices or materials. Examples: Laparotomy in which the incision was closed to the level of the deep tissue layers, sometimes called \"fascial layers\" or \"deep fascia,\" but the skin level was left open. The abdomen is left completely open after the surgery (an \"open abdomen\"). January 2023 Procedure-associated Module SSI Events 9 - 9 Prim ary Closure: The closure of the skin level during the original surgery, regardless of the presence of wires, wicks, drains, or other devices or objects extruding through the incision. This category includes surgeries where the skin is closed by some means . Thus, if any portion of the incision is closed at the skin level, by any manner, a designation of primary closure should be assigned to the surgery. Note : When a procedure has multiple incision/laparoscopic trocar sites and any of the incisions are closed primarily then the procedure technique is recorded as primary closed. Scope: An instrument used to reach and visualize the site of the operative procedure. In the context of an NHSN operative procedure, use of a scope involves creation of several small incisions to perform or assist in the performance of an operation rather than use of a traditional larger incision (specifically, open approach). ICD-10-PCS co des can be helpful in answering this scope question. The fifth character indicates the approach to reach the procedure site: ICD-10 5th Character Approach NHSN Scope Designation 0 Open NO 3 Percutaneous (Included only in CRAN and VSHN categories - procedures with BURR holes) NO 4 Percutaneous endoscopic YES 7 Via natural or artificial opening NO 8 Via natural or artificial opening with endoscopic NO F Via natural or artificial opening with percutaneous endoscopic assistance YES Note: If a procedure is coded as open and scope then the procedure should be reported to NHSN as Scope = NO . The open designation is considered a higher risk procedure. For CPT codes, the scope question can be answered based on the procedure code description. Using HYST code 58570 as an example, the procedure code description indicates Laparoscopy, surgical, with total hysterectomy. Laparoscopy is Scope = YES. HYST 58570 Laparoscopy, surgical, with total hysterectomy, for uterus 250 g or less January 2023 Procedure-associated Module SSI Events 9 - 10 Trauma: Blunt or penetrating injury occurring prior to the start of the procedure. Complex trauma cases may require multiple trips to the OR during the same admission to repair the initial trauma. In such cases, trauma = Yes. Weight: The patient's most recent weight documented in the medical record in pounds (lbs.) or kilograms (kg) prior to or otherwise closest to the procedure. Wound class: An assessment of the degree of contamination of a surgical wound at the time of the surgical procedure . Wound class is assigned by a person involved in the surgical procedure (for example, surgeon, circulating nurse, etc.) based on the wound class schema that is adopted within each organization. The four wound classifications available within the NHSN application are : Clean (C), Clean -Contaminated (CC), Contaminated (CO), and Dirty/Infected (D] . The following operative procedure categories cannot be recorded as clean (C) within the application: APPY, BILI, CHOL, COLO, REC, SB, and VHYS. If a clean (C) wound class wa s assigned to a procedure in one of these procedure categories, the procedure cannot be included in the denominator for procedure data. The IP should not modify the wound class. January 2023 Procedure-associated Module SSI Events 9 - 11 Table 1. Surgical Site Infection Criteria Criterion Surgical Site I nfection (SSI) Superficial incisional SSI Must meet the following criteria: Date of event occurs within 30 days following the NHSN operative procedure (where day 1 = the procedure date) AND involves only skin and subcutaneous tissue of the incision AND patient has at least one of the following: a. purulent drainage from the superficial incision. b. organism(s) identified from an aseptically -obtained specimen from the superficial incision or subcutaneous tissue by a culture or non - culture based microbiologic testing method which is performed for purposes of clinical diagnosis or treatment (for example, not Active Surveillance Culture/Testing [ ASC/AST ]). c. a superficial incision that is deliberately opened by a surgeon, physician* or physician designee and culture or non- culture based testing of the superficial incision or subcutaneous tissue is not performed AND patient has at least one of the following signs or symptoms: localized pain or tenderness; localized swelling; eryth ema; or heat. d. diagnosis of a superficial incisional SSI by a physician* or physician designee. * The term physician for the purpose of application of the NHSN SSI criteria may be interpreted to mean a surgeon, infectious disease physician, emergency phys ician, other physician on the case, or physician's designee (nurse practitioner or physician's assistant). January 2023 Procedure-associated Module SSI Events 9 - 12 Superficial incisional SSI Comments There are two specific types of superficial incisional SSIs: 1. Superficial Incisional Primary (SIP) - a superficial incisional SSI that is identified in the primary incision in a patient that has had an operation with one or more incisions (for example, C -section incision or chest incision for CBGB) 2. Superficial Incisional Secondary (SIS) - a superficial incisional SSI that is identified in the secondary incision in a patient that has had an operation with more than one incision (for example, donor site incision for CBGB) Note: Refer to SSI Event Reporting Instruction #7 for NHSN operative procedure categories with secondary incision sites available for SSI attribution Reporting Instructions for Superficial incisional SSI The following do not qualify as criteria for meeting the NHSN definition of superficial incisional SSI: Diagnosis/treatment of cellulitis (redness/warmth/swelling), by itself, does not superficial incisional SSI criterion 'd' . A stitch abscess alone (minimal inflammation and discharge confined to the points of suture penetr ation). A localized stab wound or pin site infection; depending on the depth, these infections might be considered either a skin (SKIN) or soft tissue (ST) infection. Note : For an NHSN operative procedure, a laparoscopic trocar site is considered a surgical incision and not a stab wound. If a surgeon uses a laparoscopic trocar site to place a drain at the end of a procedure this is considered a surgical incision. January 2023 Procedure-associated Module SSI Events 9 - 13 Deep incisional SSI Must meet the following criteria: Date of event occurs within 30 or 90 days following the NHSN operative procedure (where day 1 = the procedure date) according to the list in Table 2 AND involves deep soft tissues of the incision (for example, fascial and muscle layers) AND patient has at least one of the following : a. purulent drainage from the deep incision. b. a deep incision that is deliberately opened or aspirated by a surgeon , physician* or physician designee or spontaneously dehisces AND organism(s) identified from the deep soft tissues of the incision by a culture or non- culture based microbiologic testing method which is performed for purposes of clinical diagnosis or treatment (for example, not Active Surveillance Culture/Testing [ ASC/AST ]) or culture or non- culture based microbiologic testing method is not performed. A culture or non -culture based test from the deep soft tissues of the incision that has a negative finding does not meet this criterion. AND patient has at least one of the following signs or symptoms: fever (>38\u00b0C); localized pain or tenderness. c. an abscess or other evidence of infection involving the deep incision detected on gross anatomical exam , histopathologic exam, or imaging test. * The term physician for the purpose of application of the NHSN SSI criteria may be interpreted to mean a surgeon, infectious disease physician, emergency physician, other physician on the case, or physician's designee (nurse practitioner or physician's assistant). January 2023 Procedure-associated Module SSI Events 9 - 14 Comments Deep incisional SSI There are two specific types of deep incisional SSIs: 1. Deep Incisional Primary (DIP) - a deep incisional SSI that is identified in a primary incision in a patient that has had an operation with one or more incisions (for example, C -section incision or chest incision for CBGB) 2. Deep Incisional Secondary (DIS) - a deep incisional SSI that is identified in the secondary incision in a patient that has had an operation with more than one incision (for example, donor site incision for CBGB) Note: Refer to SSI Event Reporting Instruction #7 for NHSN operative procedure categories with secondary incision sites available for SSI attribution. January 2023 Procedure-associated Module SSI Events 9 - 15 Organ/Space SSI Must meet the following criteria: Date of event occurs within 30 or 90 days following the NHSN operative procedure (where day 1 = the procedure date) according to the list in Table 2 AND involves any part of the body deeper than the fascial/muscle layers that is opened or manipulated during the operative procedure AND patient has at least one of the following: a. purulent drainage from a drain placed into the organ/space (for example, closed suction drainage system, open drain, T -tube drain, CT - guided drainage). b. organism(s) identified from fluid or tissue in the organ/space by a culture or non- culture based microbiologic testing method which is performed for purposes of clinical diagnosis or treatment (for example, not Active Surveillance Culture/Testin g [ASC/AST ]). c. an abscess or other evidence of infection involving the organ/space detected on gross anatomical exam or histopathologic exam , or imaging test evidence definitive or equivocal for infection. AND meets at least one criterion for a specific organ/space infection site listed in Table 3. These criteria are found in the Surveillance Definitions for Specific Types of Infections (Chapter 17) January 2023 Procedure-associated Module SSI Events 9 - 16 Table 2. Surveillance Periods for SSI Following Selected NHSN Operative Procedure Categories. Day 1 = the date of the procedure. 30-day Surveillance Category Operative Procedure Category Operative Procedure AAA Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair LAM Laminectomy AMP Limb amputation LTP Liver transplant APPY Appendix surgery NECK Neck surgery for surgery BILI Bile endarterectomy PRST Prostate surgery CHOL Gallbladder surgery REC Rectal surgery COLO Colon surgery SB Small bowel surgery CSEC Cesarean section SPLE Spleen surgery GAST Gastric surgery THOR Thoracic surgery HTP laparotomy 90-day Surveillance Category Operative Procedure BRST Breast surgery CARD Cardiac surgery CBGB Coronary artery bypass graft with both chest and donor site incisions CBGC Coronary artery bypass graft with chest incision only CRAN Craniotomy FUSN Spinal fusion FX Open reduction of fracture HER Herniorrhaphy HPRO Hip prosthesis KPRO Knee prosthesis shunt Notes: Superficial incisional SSIs are monitored for a 30-day period for all procedure types.

January 2023 Procedure-associated Module SSI Events 9 - 18 SSI Event (Numerator) Reporting Numerator Data: All patients having any of the procedures included in the selected NH SN operative procedure category(s) are monitored for SSI. The Surgical Site Infection (SSI) form is completed for each SSI. If no SSI events are identified during the surveillance month, check the \"Report No Events\" field in the Missing PA Events tab of the Incomplete/Missing List. The Instructions for Completion of the Surgical Site Infection Form (CDC 57.120) include brief instructions for collection and entry of each data element on the form. The SSI form includes patient demographic information and specific event details that pertain to the S SI event. SSI Event Reporting Instructions : 1. Excluded organisms: Well- known community associated organisms (organisms belonging to genera: Blastomyces, Histoplasma, Coccidioides, Paracoccidioides, Cryptococcus and Pneumocystis) and/or with latent infections (for example, herpes, shingles, syphilis, or tuberculosis) are excluded from meeting SSI criteria. 2. Attributing SSI to an NHSN operative procedure when there is evidence of infection at the time of the primary surgery: The present on a dmission (POA) definition does not apply to the SSI protocol. If evidence of infection is present at the time of the procedure and the patient meets SSI criteria within the SSI surveillance period following the procedure, an SSI is attributed to the procedure (for guidance on PATOS determination, see SSI Event Reporting Instruction #3 ). 3. Infection present at time of surgery (PATOS): PATOS is a YES/NO field on the SSI event form. PATOS denotes that there is evidence of infection visualized (seen) during the surgical procedure to which the subsequent SSI is attributed. The evidence of infection must be note d intraoperatively and documented within the narrative portion of the operative note or report of surgery to be eligible for PATOS (pre/post op diagnoses, 'indication for surgery', and other heading s routinely included in an operative note are not eligible with answering PATOS) . Key points for consideration : a) Only select PATOS = YES when it applies to the depth of the SSI that is being attributed to the procedure. Example s: When a patient has documentation of an intraabdominal infection at time of surgery and then later returns with an organ/space SSI , PATOS = YES. When a patient has documentation of an intraabdominal infection at time of surgery and then later returns with a superficial or deep incisional SSI , PATOS = NO. January 2023 Procedure-associated Module SSI Events 9 - 19 b) Examples that indicate evidence of infection include but are not limited to: abscess, of infection at the organ/space level . c) Examples of verbiage that is not consi dered evidence of infection include but are not limited to : colon perforation, contamination, necrosis, gangrene, fecal spillage, nicked bowel during procedure, murky fluid, or documentation of inflammation. d) The use of the ending \"itis\" in an operative note/report of surgery does not automatically meet PATOS, as it may only reflect inflammation which is not infectious in nature (for example, diverticulitis, peritonitis, and appendicitis). e) Pathology report findings and imaging test findings cannot be used for PATOS determination. f) Identification of an organism using culture or non- culture based microbiologic testing method or on a pathology report from a surgical specimen cannot be used for PATOS determination. g) Wound class cannot be used for PATOS determination. h) Trauma resulting in a contaminated case does not automatically meet the PATOS requirement. For example, a fresh gunshot wound to the abdomen may be a trauma with a high wound class but there would not be time for infection to develop. Examples of PATOS application: A pat ient undergoes an XLAP where there is a finding of a ruptured appendix and an APPY is performed. Two weeks later the patient meets criteria for an organ/space IAB SSI. The PATOS field is selected as YES since a ruptured appendix is noted at time of surgery in the same tissue level as the subsequent SSI. During a COLO procedure the surgeon documents multiple abscesses in the intraabdominal cavity. Patient returns three weeks later and meets criteria for a superficial incisional SSI. The PATOS field is selected as NO since there was no documentation of evidence of infection of the superficial tissues at time of the COLO. During a CSEC the surgeon nicks the bowel and there is contamination of the intraabdominal cavity. One week later the patient meets cr iteria for an organ/space OREP SSI. The PATOS field is selected as NO since there is no documentation of evidence of infection at the time of the CSEC. The colon nick is a complication but there is not infection present at time of surgery. Patient undergo es an AMP due to \"dry -gangrene\" of the foot from chronic ischemia. The patient returns two weeks later and meets criteria for a deep incisional SSI. The January 2023 Procedure-associated Module SSI Events 9 - 20 PATOS field is selected as NO since there i s not documentation of evidence of infection at time of the AMP. The word gangrene is not sufficient for infection. Note : For more information about PATOS, see Quick Learn titled \" Surgical Site Infection (SSI) Event PATOS - Infection Present at Time of Surgery \" 4. Multiple tissue levels are involved in the infection: The type of SSI (superficial incisional, deep incisional, or organ/space) reported must reflect the deepest tissue level where SSI criteria are met during the surveillance period. Repo rt infection that meets criteria for organ/space SSI as an organ/space SSI, regardless of superficial or deep tissue involvement. Report infection that meets criteria for deep incisional SSI as a deep incisional SSI, regardless of superficial tissue involvement. If an SSI start s as a deep incisional SSI on day 10 of the SSI surveillance period and a week later (day 17 of the SSI surveillance period) meets criteria for an organ space SSI, the DOE is the date of the organ/space SSI. 5. Attributing SSI to a NHSN procedure when several are performed on different dates: When a patient has several NHSN operative procedures performed on different dates, attribute the SSI to the most recently performed NHSN operative procedure. Note: For multiple NHSN operative procedures performed within a 24 hour period, see Denominator Reporting Instruction # 7 . 6. Attributing SSI to NHSN procedures that involve multiple primary incision sites: When multiple primary incision sites of the same NHSN operative procedure become infected, report as a single SSI, and assign the type of SSI (superficial incisional, deep incisional, or organ/space) that represents the deepest tissue level where SSI criteria are met at any of the involved primary incision sites during the surveillance period. Examples: If one laparoscopic incision meets criteria for a superficial incisional SSI and another laparoscopic incision meets criteria for a deep incisional SSI, report one deep incisional SSI. If one or more laparoscopic incision sites meet criteria for superficial incisional SSI but the patient also has an organ/space SSI related to the procedure, report one organ/space SSI. If an operative procedure is limited to a single breast and involves multiple incisions in that breast that become infected, report a single SSI. In a colostomy format ion or reversal (take down) procedure, the stoma and other abdominal incision sites are considered primary incisions. If both the stoma and January 2023 Procedure-associated Module SSI Events 9 - 21 another abdominal incision site develop superficial incisional SSI, report as one SSI (SIP). 7. Attributing SSI to NHS N operative procedures that have secondary incision sites : Certain procedures can involve secondary incisions (specifically the following, BRST, CBGB, CEA, FUSN, PVBY, REC, and VSHN). The surveillance period for all secondary incision sites is 30 days, regardless of the required deep incisional or organ/space SSI surveillance period for the primary incision site(s) ( Table 2 ). Procedures meeting this designation are reported as one operative procedure. For example: A saphenous vein harvest incision site in a CBGB procedure is considered the secondary incision site. One CBGB procedure is reported, the saphenous vein harvest site is monitored for 30 days following surgery for SSI, and the chest incision is monitored fo r 90 days following surgery for SSI. If the patient meets criteria for an SSI at the saphenous vein harvest site (such as a superficial incisional SSI) and meets criteria for an SSI at the chest site (such as a deep incisional SSI) two SSIs are reported and linked to the CBGB procedure . A tissue harvest site (for example, Abdominis Myocutaneous [TRAM] flap ) in a BRST procedure is considered the secondary incision site. One BRST procedure is reported, and if the secondary incision site beco mes infected, report as either SIS or DIS as appropriate. 8. SSI detected at another facility: An SSI event is reported by the facility where the NHSN operative procedure was performed . When a potential SSI is detected at a facility other than the one where the procedure was performed, enough detail is provided to the reporting facility in the event an SSI should be reported to NHSN. If an SSI is determined, the reporting facility should indicate Detected = RO ( patient r eadmission to a facility other than where procedure was performed) on the SSI event form when reporting the SSI . 9. SSI attribution after multiple categories of NHSN procedures are performed during a single trip to the OR: When more than one NHSN operative procedure category i s performed through a single incision/laparoscopic site (s) during a single trip to the operating room, attribute the SSI to the procedure associated to the infection. When attribution is not clear, as is often the case when the infection is an incisional SSI, use the NHSN Principal Operative Procedure Category Selection Lists ( Table 4 ) to select the operative procedure to which the SSI should be attributed. For example, when a patient meets criteria for an SSI after a single trip to the OR in which both a COLO and SB were performed, and the source of the SSI is not apparent, assign the SSI to the COLO procedure per Table 4 . The final decision for SSI attribution lies with the local facility based on the full details of the case . January 2023 Procedure-associated Module SSI Events 9 - 22 10. SSI following invasive manipulation or accession of the operative site: An SSI will NOT be attributed when the following 3 criteria are ALL met : during the post- operative period the surgical site /space is without evidence of infection A nd an invasive manipulation or accession of the site /space is performed for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes (for example, needle aspiration, accession of ventricular shunts, accession of breast expanders) A nd an infection subsequently develops in a tissue level which was entered during the manipulation/ accession. Note s: Tissue levels not manipulated/accessed are still eligible for SSI. For example, a superficial debridement following a COLO procedure, where the muscle/fascia and organ/space is not entered, a subsequent deep incisional or organ/space SSI following the debridement may be an SSI attributable to the COLO procedure. This reporting instruction does NOT apply to closed manipulation (for example, closed reduction of a dislocated hip after an orthopedic procedure). Invasive manip ulation does not include wound packing or changing of wound packing materials as part of postoperative care. Routine flushing of catheters as part of the facility's standard care and maintenance is not considered invasive manipulation. 11. Reporting instructions for post -operative infection scenarios: An SSI should be reported to NHSN without regard to post- operative accidents, falls, inappropriate showering or bathing practices, or other occurrences that may or may not be attributable to patients' intentio nal or unintentional postoperative actions. An SSI should also be reported regardless of the presence of certain skin conditions (for example, dermatitis, blister, impetigo) noted near an incision, and regardless of the possible occurrence of a \"seeding\" event from an unrelated procedure (for example, dental work). This instruction concerning various postoperative circumstances is necessary to reduce subjectivity and data collection burden. January 2023 Procedure-associated Module SSI Events 9 - 23 Table 4. NHSN Principal Operative Procedure Category Selection List (The categories with the highest risk of SSI are listed before those with lower risks.)

For all patients having any of the procedures included in the NHSN operative procedure category(s) for which SSI surveillance is being performed during the month, complete the Denominator for Procedure form . An operative procedure code is required to determine the correct NHSN operative procedure category to be reported. The Instructions for Completion of the Denominator for Procedure Form (57.121) include brief instructions for collection and entry of each data element on the form. Denominator Reporting Instructions: 1. Different operative procedure categories performed during same trip to the OR : When procedures in more than one NHSN operative procedure category are performed during the same trip to the operating room through the same or different incisions, a Denominator for Procedure f orm is completed for each NHSN operative procedure category being monitored in the Monthly Reporting Plan. For example : If a CARD and CBGC are performed through the same incision during the same trip to the operating room , and both procedures are monitored in the Monthly Reporting Plan, complete a Denominator for Procedure form for each procedure. If following a motor vehicle accident, a patient has an FX and SPLE performed during the same trip to the operating roo m, and both procedures are monitored in the Monthly Reporting Plan, complete a Denominator for Procedure form for each procedure. EXCEPTION: If a patient has both a CBGC and CBGB during the same trip to the operating room, report only as a CBGB. Only report as a CBGC if there is only a chest incision. CBGB and CBGC are never reported for the same patient for the same trip to the operating room. 2. Duration of the operative procedure s when more than one category of NHSN operative procedure is performed through the same incision: If more than one NHSN operative procedure category is performed through the same incision during the same trip to the OR , record the combined duration of all procedures, which is the time from procedure/surgery start time to procedure/surgery finish time. For example, if a CBGC and a CARD are performed on a patient during the same trip to the operating room, the time from start time to finish time is reported for both operative procedures. 3. Duration of operative procedures if patient has two different NHSN operative procedures performed via separate incisions on the same trip to the OR: Try to determine the correct duration for each separate procedure (if this is documented); otherwise, take the time for January 2023 Procedure-associated Module SSI Events 9 - 25 both procedures and split it evenly between the two. For example, if an AMP and SPLE are performed during the same trip to the OR. 4. Sam e operative procedure category but different ICD -10-PCS or CPT codes during same trip to the OR: If procedures of different ICD- 10-PCS or CPT codes from the same NHSN operative procedure category are performed through the same incision/laparoscopic sites , record one procedure for that category. For example, a facility is performing surveillance for CARD procedures and a patient undergoes a replacement of both the mitral and tricuspid valves during the same trip to the operating room (two CARD procedure codes are assigned) . Complete one CARD Denominator for Procedure form because both procedures are in the same operative procedure category (CARD). 5. For revision HPRO and KPRO procedures: If total or partial revision HPRO or KPRO is performed, determine if any of the ICD- 10-PCS/CM diagnosis or procedure codes indicatin g infection (see link below) were assigned to the index joint in the 90 days prior to and including the index HPRO or KPRO revision. If any of the specified codes are assigned to the procedure, indicate on the Denominator for Procedure form that the revision was associated with 'prior infection at index joint' = YES. The 'prior infection at index joint' variable only applies to revision HPRO and KPRO. The cases designated 'prior infec tion at index joint' = YES should be validated before the procedure is submitted to NHSN. This validation is necessary to ensure the code is aligned with the index joint revision. The ICD- 10-PCS/CM code mapping guidance is found on the NHSN website in the SSI section under \" Operative Procedure Code Documents .\" 6. Same NHSN operative procedure category via separate incisions : For operative procedures that can be performed via separate incisions during same trip to the operating room (specifically the following, AMP, BRST, CEA, FUSN, FX, HER, HPRO, KPRO, LAM, NEPH, OVRY, PVBY), separate Denominator for Procedure forms are completed. To document the durati on of the procedures, indicate the procedure/surgery start time to procedure/surgery finish time for each procedure separately or, alternatively, take the total time for the procedures and split it evenly between procedures. Appendix B provides guidance for the 12 NHSN operative procedure categories that can have multiple procedures reported per category per patient per calend ar day. Notes: A COLO procedure with a colostomy formation is entered as one COLO procedure. Laparoscopic hernia repairs are considered one HER procedure, regardless of the number of hernias repaired in that trip to the OR. In most cases there will be only one incision time documented for this procedure. If more than one time is documented, total the durations. Open (specifically, non -laparoscopic ) hernia repairs are reported as one HER proce dure for each hernia repaired via a separate incision, (specifically, if two incisions are made to repair two defects, then two HER procedures are reported). It is January 2023 Procedure-associated Module SSI Events 9 - 26 anticipated that separate incision times will be recorded for these procedures. If not, take the total time for both procedures and split it evenly between the two. 7. More than one operative procedure through same incision /surgical space within 24 hours: When a patient has more than one operative procedure via the same incision or into the same surgical space and the second procedure start time is within 24 hours of the first procedure finish time, report one Denominator for Procedure form for the original procedure, combining the durations for both procedures based on the procedure start times and finish times for both procedures. For example, a patient has a CBGB lasting 4 hours and returns to the OR six hours later for another operative procedure via the same incision (for example, CARD). The second operation has duration of 1.5 hours. Record the operative procedure as one CBGB and the duration of operation as 5 hour 30 minutes. If the wound class has changed, report the higher wound class. If the ASA class has changed, report the higher ASA class. Do not report the CARD procedure in your denominator data. Note: When the patient returns to the OR within 24 hours of the end of the first procedure assign the surgical wound closure technique that applies when the patient leaves the OR from the first operative procedure. 8. Patient expires in the OR: If a patient expires in the operating room, do not complete a Denominator for Procedure form. This operative procedure is excluded from the denominator. 9. HYST or VHYS: For the purpose of NHSN SSI reporting, hysterectomy procedure codes that involve an incision made into the abdomen, including trocar insertion, are listed in the abdominal hysterectomy (HYST) category. The correct CPT hysterectomy procedure codes should be assigned by a medical record coder using current guidelines and conventions. Hysterectomy procedures should be designated as an HYST or VHYS, based on the approach of the procedure (5th character of the ICD- 10 operative procedure code) the facility' s medical coder assigns to the hysterectomy procedure. Procedure ICD-10 5th Character Approach HYST 0 Open 4 Percutaneous endoscopic F Via natural or artificial opening with percutaneous endoscopic assistance VHYS 7 Via natural or artificial opening 8 Via natural or artificial opening with endoscopic January 2023 Procedure-associated Module SSI Events 9 - 27 Data Analyses Once procedure (denominator) and SSI (numerator) data are collected and entered into NHSN, the data can be analyzed/visualized in various ways including with descripti ve analysis reports and Standardized Infection Ratio (SIR) reports. Types of SSI Analyses Rep orts Descriptive analysis reports Descriptive analysis report options , such as line listings, frequency tables, and bar and pie charts are available for numerator and denominator data . A line list, frequency table, and rate table are also available to analyze pathogens and antimicrobial su sceptibility data reported for each SSI. Quick reference guides on these reports can be found at the bottom of this page: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/ps- analysis - resources/re ference-guides.html SSI Rate Reports SSI rates per 100 operative procedures are calculated by dividing the number of SSIs by the number of operative procedures and multiplying the results by 100. SSIs will be included in the numerator of a rate based o n the date of procedure, not the date of event (DOE). Using the advanced analysis feature of the NHSN application, SSI rate calculations can be performed separately for the different types of operative procedures and stratified by the basic risk index. The universal exclusion criteria and SIR inclusion criteria do not apply in the calculation of the SSI rate. The SSI rate includes PATOS events and outpatient procedures, but excludes procedures with non- primary closure techniques. More information regarding the basic risk index calculation can be found in the paper: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/datastat/2009NHSNReport.pdf SSI SIR Reports The SIR is calculated by dividing the number of observed infections by the number of predicted infections. The SIR will be calculated only if the number of predicted HAIs (\"numPred\" in the NHSN application) is 1 to help enforce a minimum precision criterion. SIR = Observed (O) HAIs Pr edicted (P) HAIs The number of predicted infections is calculated using SSI probabilities estimated from multivariate logistic regression models constructed from NHSN data during a baseline time period, which represents a standard population's SSI experience. The procedures/SSI occurring in adults are modeled separately from those occurring in pediatrics. January 2023 Procedure-associated Module SSI Events 9 - 28 The SSI SIR can be generated for individual procedures for different summary time periods. While the SSI SIR can be calculated for single procedure categories and for specific surgeons, the measure also allows you to summarize your data across multiple procedure categories while adjusting for differences in the estimated probability of infection among the patients included across the procedure categories. For example, you will be able to obtain one SSI SIR adjusting for all procedures reported. Alternatively, you can obtain one SSI SIR for all COLO only within your facility. Additional Notes about SSI SIRs 1. Closure technique: All the SSI SIRs that use the 2006 -2008 SSI baseline data will include only those procedures that were reported with a primary closure method. All the SSI SIRs that use the 2015 baseline data will include all procedures that were reported with primary or non -primary closure methods. 2. Infection present at time of surgery (PATOS): a. All the SSI SIR reports that use the 2006- 2008 SSI baseline will include SSIs that are reported as present at time of surgery. This means that the PATOS event is included in the numerator of the SIR and the procedure from which the event occurred is included in the denominator of the SIR. b. All the SSI SIR reports that use the new 2015 SSI baseline will exclude SSIs that are reported as present at time of surgery from the numerator and the procedures to which they are linked from the denominator. Therefore, the PATOS event s and their linked procedures a re not included in any of the 2015 baseline SSI SIR reports. 3. SIRs based on Procedure Date: SSIs will be included in the numerator of an SIR based on the date of procedure, not the DOE . This is because the procedure carries the risk for the infection/SSI. There are three main SSI SIR Models available from NHSN, each briefly described in the table below. The first two models, the All SSI SIR and the Complex A/R SSI SIR models, are available for all NHSN operative procedures/SSI occurring in both adults and pediatric patients, while the third model, the Complex 30 -day SSI SIR is available for colon and abdominal hysterectomy procedures/SSI occurring in adults only.

Any procedure that meets any of the exclusion criteria is universally excluded from any SSI SIR calculation. The \"Line List of Procedures Excluded from the SIR\" is an NHSN analysis report that is intended to assist users in reviewing the procedures that are excluded from the SIRs and the reasons for the exclusion.

Same NHSN operative procedure category via separate incisions : A MP, BRST, CEA, FUSN, FX, HER, HPRO, KPRO, LAM, NEPH, OVRY, PVBY. The instruction provides guidance on correct procedure reporting when multiple procedures from one of these categories (procedures from the same category) are performed per patient per calendar day. The table includes the maximum # of procedures per day per patient and an explanation. Operative Procedure Category Maximum # Of Procedures Per Day Explanation AMP - Limb amputation 4 Corresponds to the four (4) extremities (left arm, left leg , right arm, right leg). In instances where multiple AMP procedures are performed on the same extremity only one AMP procedure should be reported for that extremity. BRST - Breast surgery 2 Corresponds to the left breast and right breast. CEA - Carotid endarterectomy 2 Corresponds to the left artery and right artery. FUSN - Spinal fusion 4 Corresponds to the four (4) anatomical spinal levels (cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral). When more than one anatomical spinal level is fused, report the NHSN spinal level and approach in which the most vertebrae were fused . The number of FUSN procedures reported depends on various factors: When a spinal fusion procedure is performed on one spinal level/contiguous spinal levels, this is considered one FUSN procedure for reporting purposes although multiple joints may be fused and multiple procedures codes are assigned. When an anterior and posterior incision are made to access one spinal level/contiguous spinal levels (such as C3-C5 spinal fusion with anterior and posterior approach) one FUSN procedure is reported. Indicate 'Anterior and Posterior' ap proach on the denominator for procedure form. January 2023 Procedure-associated Module SSI Events 9 - 41 Operative Procedure Category Maximum # Of Procedures Per Day Explanation When distinct levels/sections of the spine are fused using different incisions on non -contiguous spinal levels (such as an incision made in the cervical spine and an incision made in the lumbar spine) enter as separate denominators ( two FUSN denominator for procedure forms should be completed). FX - Open reduction of fracture 4 Corresponds to the four (4) extremities (right arm, right leg, left arm, left leg). In instances where multiple FX procedures are performed on the same extremity only one FX procedure should be reported for that extremity. HER - Herniorrhaphy 5 Corresponds to five (5) hernias. Laparoscopic hernia repairs are considered one HER procedure, regardless of the number of hernias repaired in that trip to the OR. In most cases there will be only one incision time documented for this procedure. If more than one time is documented, total the durations. Open (specifically, non-laparoscopic) hernia repairs are reported as one HER procedure for each hernia repaired via a separate incision. For example: If one incision is made to repair two defects, then report one HER procedure. If two inci sions are made to repair two defects, then report two HER procedures. It is anticipated that separate incision times will be recorded for these procedures. If not, take the total time for both procedures and split it evenly between the two. HPRO - Hip prosthesis 2 Corresponds to the left hip and right hip. KPRO - Knee prosthesis 2 Corresponds to the left knee and right knee. LAM - Laminectomy 2 Corresponds to two (2) LAM procedures. NEPH - Kidney surgery 2 Corresponds to the left kidney and right kidney. OVRY - Ovarian surgery 2 Corresponds to the left ovary and right ovary. PVBY - Peripheral vascular bypass surgery 4 Corresponds to four (4) PVBY procedures.

List of Agents Eligible for PVAP ................................................................. 26 VAE Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) .................................................................................................... 28 Introduction Mechanica l ventilation is an essential, life -saving therapy for patients with critical illness and re spiratory failure . Studies have estimated that more than 300,000 patients receive mechanical ventilation in the United States each year [1- 3]. These patients are at high risk for complications and poo r outcomes, including death [1 -5]. Ventilator -associated pneumonia (VAP), sepsis, a cute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary embolism, barotrauma, and pulmonary edema a re among the complications that can occur in patients receiving mechanical ventilation . Such complications can lead to longer duration of mechanical ventilation, longer stays in the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital , increased healthcare costs, and increased risk of disability a nd death . Mortality in patients with acute lung injury on mechanical ventilation has been estimated to range from 24% in persons 15-19 years of age to 60% fo r patients 85 years and older [4]. Surveillance for ventilator -associated events i n the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) prior to 2013 was limited to VAP . For the year 2012 , VAP incidence for various types of hospital units ranged from 0.0-4.4 per 1,000 ventilator days [6] . However, there is currently no valid, reliable defin ition for VAP, and even the most widely used VAP criteria and definitions are nei ther sensitive nor specific [7 -10]. A particular difficulty with many commonly used VAP definitions , including the NHSN PNEU definitions (revised in 2002), is that they requir e radiographic findings of pneumonia . Evidence suggests that chest radiograph findings do not accurately identify VAP . The subjectivity and variability inherent in chest radiograph technique, interpretation, and reporting make chest imaging ill -suited for inclusion in a definition algorithm to be used for the potential purposes of public reporting, inter -facility comparisons, January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-2 and pay -for-reporting and pay -for-performance programs . Another major limitation of the available VAP definitions is their reliance on specific clinical signs or symptoms, which are subjective and may be poorly or inconsistently documented in the medical record. The NHSN PNEU protocol includes multiple definition pathways and special criteria for selected patient populations (for example, children, immunocompromised patients), increasing its complexity. The limitations of VAP surveillance definitions have implications for prevention . Valid and reliable surveillance data are necessary for assessing th e effectiveness of prevention strategies . It is notable that some of the most effective mea sures for improving outcomes of patients on mechanical ventilation do not specifically target pneumonia prevention [11-14]. In 2011, CDC convened a Working Group co mposed of members of several stakeholder organizations to address the limitations of the NHSN PNEU definitions and propose a new approach to surveillance for Ventilator -Associated Events (VAE) for NHSN [15] . The organizations represented in the Working Gr oup include: the Critical Care Societies Collaborative (the American Association of Critical -Care Nurses, the American College of Chest Physicians, the American Thoracic Society, and the Society for Critical Care Medicine) , the American Association for Res piratory Care , the Association of Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology , the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists , the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee's Surveillance Working Group, the Infectious Diseases Society of America , and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. The VAE surveillance definition algorithm developed by the Working Group and implemented in the NHSN in January 2013 is based on objective, streamlined, and potentially automatabl e criteria that identify a broad range of conditions and complications occurring in mechanical ly-ventilated adult patients [16 ]. Several modifications to the VAE definitions have been made since January 2013 . These modifications address issues raised by NHSN users and discussed with the Working Group . There are three definition tiers within the VAE algorithm: 1) Ventilator -Associated Condition (VAC); 2) Infection - related Ventilator -Associated Complication (IVAC); and 3) Possible VAP (PVAP). D ata indicat e that streamlined, objective algorithms to detect ventilator -asso ciated complications (similar to the VAC tier of the VAE algorithm) are easily implemented, can make use of electronic health record systems to automate event detection, and identify events that are clinica lly important and associated with outcomes such as ICU and hospital length of stay and mortality [16,17 ]. Research suggests that most VACs are due to pneumonia, ARDS , atelectasis, and pulmonary edema [16]. These are significant clinical conditions that may be preventable . VAE rates and event characteristics in adult inpatient locations reporting data to NHSN in 2014 have been published [18]. NOTE: The VAE definition algorithm is for use in surveillance . It is not a clinical definition algorithm and is not intended for use in the clinical management of patients . Examples provided throughout this protocol and in the VAE \"Frequently -Asked Questions\" are for illustration purposes only and are not intended to represent actual cli nical scenarios . Settings Inpatient locations eligible to participate in VAE surveillance are those adult locations in acute care hospitals, long term acute care hospitals, and inpatient rehabilitation facilities where denominator data (ventilator and patient days) can be collected for patients . Such locations may include critical/intensive January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-3 care units (ICU), specialty care areas (SCA), step -down units , and wards . A complete listing of adult inpatient locations can be found in Chapter 15 CDC Locations and Descriptions. Non -acute care mapped locations in acute care facilities (chronic care units in acute care facilities) are not eligible to participate in VAE surv eillance. It is not r equired to monitor for VAE s after discharge if a patient is transferred to another facility while still on mechanical ventilation. However, if discovered, any VAE with a date of event on the day of discharge or the day after discharge is attributed to the discharging location and should be included in any VAEs reported to NHSN by the discharging location . No additional ventilator days are reported. Definition s VAE: VAEs are identified by using a combination of objective criteria: deterioration in respiratory status after a period of stability or improvement on the ventilator, evidence of infection or inflammation, and laboratory evidence of respiratory infection. The following pages outline the criteria that must be used for meeting the VAE surveillance definitions (Figure 1 ). To report VAEs, use the Ventilator -Associated Event (VAE) form ( CDC 57.112) and Instructions for Completion of Ventilator -Associated Event Form . Patients must be mechanically ventilated for at least 4 calendar days to fulfill VAE criteria (where the day of intubation and initiation of mechanical ventilation is day 1) . The earliest date of event for VAE (the date of onset of worsening oxygenation) is day 3 of mechanical ventilation. Line lists of VAE data elements demonstrating scenarios that meet and do not meet the VAE definitions ar e presented in \"Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\" number (no.) 2 at the end of this protocol. The baseline period of stability or improvement on the ventilator is defined as the 2 calendar days immediately preceding the first day of increased daily minimu m PEEP or FiO 2, and must be characterized by 2 calendar days of stable or decreasing daily minimum FiO 2 or PEEP values (specifically the daily minimum PEEP or FiO 2 on the second day of the baseline period of stability or improvement must be equal to or l ess than the daily minimum PEEP or FiO 2 on the first day of the baseline period of stability or improvement) . The definitions of \"daily minimum PEEP\" and \"daily minimum FiO 2\" are included below . Note that the minimum daily PEEP or FiO 2 used for VAE surve illance is the lowest setting during a calendar day that was maintained for > 1 hour (see daily minimum PEEP and FiO 2 definitions for exception to 1 hour requirement). For the purposes of VAE surveillance, PEEP values between 0 cmH 2O and 5 cmH 2O will be considered equivalent . This means that patients with daily minimum PEEP values from 0 to 5 cmH 2O must then have an increase in the daily minimum PEEP to at least 8 cmH 2O, sustained for at least 2 calendar days, to meet the VAC definition. January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-4 EXAMPLE: In the example below, the baseline period is defined by mechanical ventilation (MV) days 1 through 4 (shaded in light gray), and the period of worsening oxygenation by MV days 5 and 6 (shaded in darker gray), where the daily minimum PEEP is 3 cm H2O greater than the daily minimum PEEP of the first day in the baseline period . Note that there is no VAC on MV day 3, because PEEP values 0 -5 cmH 2O are considered equivalent for the purposes of this surveillance. EXAMPLE: In the example below, the baseline period is defined by mechanical ventilation (MV) days 1 through 4 (shaded in light gray), and the period of worsening oxygenation by MV days 5 and 6 (shaded in darker gray), where the daily minimum PEEP is 3 cmH 2O greater than the daily minimum PEEP of the first day in the baseline period. In this example, note that MV days 1-4 are considered a baseline period even though the daily minimum PEEP increases from 0 to 3 to 5 cmH 2O during this time period - because PEEP values from 0 -5 cmH 2O are considered equivalent for the pur poses of this surveillance. EXAMPLE: In the example below, the baseline period is defined by mechanical ventilation (MV) days 3 and 4 (shaded in light gray), and the period of worsening oxygenation by MV days 5 and 6 (shaded in darker gray), where the daily minimum FiO 2 is 0.20 (20 points) over the daily minimum FiO 2 of the first day in the baseline period. MV Day Daily minimum PEEP (cmH 2O) Daily minimum FiO 2 (oxygen concentration, %) VAE 1 0 (5) 1.00 (100%) - 2 0 (5) 0.50 (50%) - 3 5 0.50 (50%) - 4 5 0.50 (50%) - 5 8 0.50 (50%) VAC 6 8 0.50 (50%) - MV Day Daily minimum PEEP (cmH 2O) Daily minimum FiO 2 (oxygen concentration, %) VAE 1 0 (5) 1.00 (100%) - 2 0 (5) 0.50 (50%) - 3 3 (5) 0.50 (50%) - 4 5 0.50 (50%) - 5 8 0.50 (50%) VAC 6 8 0.50 (50%) - MV Day Daily minimum PEEP (cmH 2O) Daily minimum FiO 2 (oxygen concentration, %) VAE 1 8 1.00 (100%) - 2 6 0.50 (50%) - 3 5 0.40 (40%) - 4 5 0.40 (40%) - 5 6 0.70 (70%) VAC 6 6 0.70 (70%) - January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-5 EXAMPLE: In the example below, there is no VAC , because the FiO 2 on MV day 4 is higher than the FiO 2 on MV day 3 (and therefore not stable or decreasing) - even though the FiO 2 on MV days 3 and 4 meets the 20 -point threshold when compared with the daily minimum FiO 2 on MV days 5 and 6 . Patients on high frequency ventilation, extracorporeal life support , or paracorporeal membrane oxygenation are EXCLUDED from VAE surveillance during periods of time when the support is in place the entire calendar day (see FAQ no . 22 at the end of this protocol). Patients who are receiving a conventional mode of mechanical ventilation while in the prone position and patients who are receiving a conventional mode of mechanical ventilation while receiving nitric oxide therapy, helium -oxygen mixtures (heliox) , or epoprostenol therapy are INCLUDED in VAE surveillance. Patients on Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV) or related modes (see FAQ nos . 22 and 23 at the end of this protocol ), are INCLUDED. When this mode is in use the VAE period of stability or improvement on the ventilator and the period of worsening oxygenation should be determined by changes in FiO 2 only, since changes in PEEP as indicated in this surveillance algorithm may not be applicable to APRV . In addition, patients with VAE who are on APRV or related modes of mechanical ventilation can optionally be indicated as such on the VAE f orm (CDC 57.112). Date of E vent : The da te of onset of worsening oxygenation . This is defined as the first calendar day in which the daily minimum PEEP or FiO 2 increases above the thresholds outlined in the VAE definition algorithm (specifically day 1 of the required 2 -day period of worsening oxygenation following a 2 -day period of stability or improvement on the ventilator). The date of event is NOT the dat e on which all VAE criteria have been met . It is the first day (of a 2 - day period) on which either of the worsening oxygenation thresholds (for PEEP or FiO 2) is met. EXAMPLE: A patient is intubated in the Emergency Room for severe community -acquired pneumonia and admitted (day 1) to the medical ICU (MICU). The patient stabilizes and improves on days 2 -5, with a daily minimum FiO 2 of 0.35 (35%) on days 4 and 5. On day 6, the patient experiences respiratory deterioration, and requires a minimum FiO 2 of 0.60 (60%) on days 6 and 7, meeting the criteria for a VAC . The date of the VAC event is day 6. VAE Window Period : This is the period of days around the date of event (specifically the day of onset of worsening oxygenation) within which other VAE criteria must be met . It is usually a 5 -day period and includes the 2 days before, the day of , and the 2 days after the VAE date of event (specifically the first MV Day Daily minimum PEEP (cmH 2O) Daily minimum FiO 2 (oxygen concentration, %) VAE 1 8 1.0 (100%) - 2 6 0.50 (50%) - 3 5 0.35 (35%) - 4 5 0.40 (40%) - 5 6 0.70 (70%) No event 6 6 0.70 (70%) - January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-6 day of worsening oxygenation, the day of VAE onset) . There is an exc eption, however, in which the VAE Window P eriod is only 3 or 4 days, as follows: In cases where the VA E date of event corresponds to MV day 3 or d ay 4, the window period described above may only be a 3 -day or a 4-day window, because it can NOT include any days before the 3rd day of MV. For example, if the VAE date of event is MV day 3, then the window period includes only the day of VAE onset and the 2 days after VAE onset (because the 2 days before VAE onset are before the 3rd day of MV). 14-day Event Period : VAEs are defined by a 14-day period, starting on the day of onset of worsening oxygenation (the date of event, day 1) . A new VAE cannot be identified or reported until this 14 -day period has elapsed . See FAQ no . 4 at the end of this protocol. Positive End- Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) : \"A technique used in respiratory therapy in which airway pressure greater than atmospheric pressure is achieved at the end of exhalation by the introduction of a mechanical impedance to exhalation\" [19]. In patients on mechanical ventilation, PEEP is one of the key parameters that can be adjusted depending on the patient's oxygenation needs and is typically in the range of 0 to 15 cmH 2O. A sustained increase in the daily minimum PEEP of 3 cmH 2O following a period of stability or improvement on t he ventilator is one of two criteria that can be used in meeting the VAC definition. For the purposes of this surveillance, PEEP values from 0 to 5 cmH 2O are considered equivalent . Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FiO 2): The fraction of oxygen in inspired gas . For example, the FiO 2 of ambient air is 0.21; the oxygen concentration of ambient air is 21% . In patients on mechanical ventilation, the FiO 2 is one of the key parameters that can be adjusted depending on the patient's oxygenation needs and is typically in the range of 0.30 (oxygen concentration of 30%) to 1.0 (oxygen concentration of 100%) . A sustained increase in the daily minimum FiO 2 of 0.20 (20 points ) following a period of stability or improvement on the ventilator is one of the two criteria that can be used in meeting the VAC definition. Daily Minimum PEEP : The lowest value of PEEP during a calendar day that is set on the ventilator and maintained for > 1 hour . This requirement that the daily minimum PEEP be the lowest setting maintained for > 1 hour will ensure that units monitoring and recording PEEP settings hourly or more frequently than once per hour are able to apply the VAE surveillance PEEP criterion in a standardized way. If ventilator settings are monitored and recorded less frequently than once per hour (for example, every 2 hours or every 4 hours) , the daily minimum PEEP is simply the lowest value of PEEP set on the ventilator during the calendar day. EXAMPLE: PEEP is se t at the following values through the course of a calendar day: Time 12 am 4 am 8 am 12 pm 4 pm 8 pm PEEP (cmH 2O) 5 8 5 8 8 10 January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-7 In this example, the daily minimum PEEP is 5 cmH 2O. PEEP settings are being monitored and recorded every 4 hours; therefore, the lowest recorded PEEP setting for the calendar day is the value used in VAE surveillance. If there is no documentation of value s maintained for > 1 hour (for example, the lowest value of PEEP is set late in the calendar day, mechanical ventilation is discontinued early in the calendar day, PEEP settings are changed very frequently throughout the calendar day) , the daily minimum PEEP will default to the lowest value of PEEP set on the ventilator during the calendar day (regardless of how long t hat setting was maintained) . For example, a patient who is intubated and started on mechanical ventilation at 11:30 pm on June 1, with a PEEP setting of 10 cmH 2O from 11:30 pm to midnight, would have a daily minimum PEEP of 10 cmH 2O on June 1 for the pur poses of VAE surveillance . In units tracking PEEP settings every hour or more frequently than every hour, there must be sufficient consecutive recordings of a specific PEEP setting to meet the minimum required duration of > 1 hour . In units tracking PEEP every 15 minutes, 5 consecutive recordings of PEEP at a certain level would be needed to meet the required > 1 hour minimum duration (for example, at 09:00, 09:15, 09:30, 09:45, and 10:00) . In units tracking PEEP every 30 minutes, 3 consecutive recordings of PEEP at a certain level would be needed to meet the required > 1 hour minimum duration (for example, at 09:00, 09:30, and 10:00) . In units tracking PEEP every hour, 2 consecutive recordings of PEEP at a certain level would be needed to meet the required > 1 hour minimum duration (for example, at 09:00 and 10:00). EXAMPLE: The patient is intubated at 6 pm. PEEP is set at the following values through the remainder of the calendar day: Time 6 pm 7 pm 8 pm 9 pm 10 pm 11 pm PEEP (cmH2O) 10 8 5 5 8 8 In this example, the daily minimum PEEP for the purposes of VAE surveillance is 5 cmH 2O. PEEP settings are being monitored and recorded every hour . There are two consecutive hours where the PEEP setting is noted to be 5 cmH 2O (8 pm and 9 pm), and therefore required minimum duration of > 1 hour is met. EXAMPLE: The patient is intubated at 6 pm. PEEP is set at the following values through the remainder of the calendar day: Time 6 pm 7 pm 8 pm 9 pm 10 pm 11 pm PEEP (cmH 2O) 8 8 5 8 5 8 In this example, the daily minimum PEEP for the purposes of VAE surveillance is 8 cmH 2O. PEEP settings are being monitored and recorded every hour . Although the lowest PEEP is 5 cmH 2O, it is recorded at two non- consecutive time points only (8 pm, then 10 pm), and so the required January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-8 > 1 hour minimum duration is not met . There are two consecutive hours where the PEEP setting is noted to be 8 cmH 2O (6 pm and 7 pm), and therefore the r equired minimum duration of > 1 hour is met to allow use of this setting as the daily minimum value for VAE surveillance . EXAMPLE: You are reviewing a patient's ventilator settings on Wednesday morning to determine the daily minimum PEEP values for Monday and Tuesday . The MICU monitors and records PEEP settings for mechanically -ventilated patients every 30 minutes . You see that the lowest PEEP setting on Monday (5 cmH 2O) was recorded at 11:30 pm when the episode of mechanical ventilation was initiated for this patient . The patient remained at this PEEP setting for an additional 30 minutes on Tuesday morning and was then maintained on PEEP 10 cmH 2O for the rest of the day on Tuesday . What do you record as the daily minimum PEEP for Monday and for Tuesday? In this example, the only PEEP setting recorded on Monday was 5 cmH 2O. Because there is no value on Monday that has been maintained for > 1 hour, the lowest (and only) setting of 5 cmH 20 is recorded as the daily minimum PEEP for that calendar day. On Tuesday, the daily minimum PEEP should be recorded as 10 cmH 2O, which is the lowest PEEP setting maintained for > 1 hour on Tuesday. Day Time PEEP (cmH 2O) Monday 23:30 5 Tuesday 00:00 5 Tuesday 00:30 5 Tuesday 01:00 10 Tuesday 01:30 10 Tuesday 02:00 through 23:30 10 Daily Minimum FiO 2: The lowest value of FiO 2 during a calendar day that is set on the ventilator and maintained for > 1 hour . This requirement that the daily minimum FiO 2 be the lowest setting maintained for > 1 hour will ensure that units monitoring and recording FiO 2 settings hourly or more frequently than once per hour are able to apply the VAE surveillance FiO 2 criterion in a standardized way. If ventilator settings ar e monitored and recorded less frequently than once per hour (for example, every 2 hours or every 4 hours) , the daily minimum FiO 2 is simply the lowest value of FiO 2 set on the ventilator during the calendar day. EXAMPLE: FiO 2 is set at the following values through the course of a calendar day: Time 2 pm 4 pm 6 pm 8 pm 10 pm 12 am FiO 2 1.0 0.60 0.40 0.50 0.55 0.60 In this example, the patient was intubated at 2 pm. The daily minimum FiO 2 is 0.40. FiO 2 settings are being monitored and recorded every 2 hours; therefore, the lowest recorded FiO 2 setting for the calendar day is the value used in VAE surveillance . If there is no documentation of value s maintained for > 1 hour (for example, the lowest value of FiO 2 is set late in the calendar day, mechanical ventilation is discontinued early in the calendar day, FiO 2 settings are changed very frequently throughout the calendar day) , the daily minimum FiO 2 will default January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-9 to the lowest FiO 2 set on the ventilator during the calendar day (regardless of how long that setting was maintained). For example, a patient who is intubated and started on mechanical ventilation at 11:30 pm on June 1, with a FiO 2 setting of 0.30 from 11:30 pm to midnight, would have a daily mi nimum FiO 2 of 0.30 on June 1 for the purposes of VAE surveillance . In units tracking FiO 2 settings every hour or more frequently than every hour, there must be sufficient consecutive recordings of a specific FiO 2 setting to meet the minimum required duration of > 1 hour . In units tracking FiO 2 every 15 minutes, 5 consecutive recordings of FiO 2 at a certain level would be needed to meet the required > 1 hour minimum duration (for example, 09:00, 09:15, 09:30, 09:45, and 10:00). In units tracking FiO 2 every 30 minutes, 3 consecutive recordings of FiO 2 at a certain level would be needed to meet the required > 1 hour minimum duration (for example, 09:00, 09:30, and 10:00). In units tracking FiO 2 every hour, 2 consecutive recordings of FiO 2 at a certain level would be needed to meet the required > 1 hour minimum duration (for example, 09:00 and 10: 00). EXAMPLE: The patient is intubated at 6 pm. FiO 2 is set at the following values through the remainder of the calendar day: Time 6 pm 7 pm 8 pm 9 pm 10 pm 11 pm FiO 2 1.0 0.8 0.5 0.5 0.8 0.8 In this example, the daily minimum FiO 2 for the purposes of VAE surveillance is 0.5. FiO 2 settings are being monitored and recorded every hour . There are two consecutive hours where the FiO 2 setting is noted to be 0.5 (8 pm and 9 pm), and therefore required minimum duration of > 1 hour is met . EXAMPLE: The patient is intubated at 6 pm. FiO 2 is set at the following values through the remainder of the calendar day: Time 6 pm 7 pm 8 pm 9 pm 10 pm 11 pm FiO 2 0.8 0.8 0.5 0.8 0.5 0.8 In this example, the daily minimum FiO 2 for the purposes of VAE surveillance is 0.8. FiO 2 settings are being mon itored and recorded every hour . Although the lowest FiO 2 is 0.5, it is recorded at two non -consecutive time points only (8 pm, and then 10 pm), and so the required > 1 hour minimum duration is not met . There are two consecutive hours where the FiO 2 setti ng is noted to be 0.8 (6 pm and 7 pm), and therefore the required minimum duration of > 1 hour is met to allow use of this setting as the daily minimum value for VAE surveillance . EXAMPLE: You are reviewing a patient's ventilator settings on Friday morning to determine the daily minimum FiO 2 value for Thursday . The patient was intubated and initiated on mechanical ventilation at 21:45 hours on Thursday . The ICU monitored and recorded FiO 2 settings for the patient every 15 minutes during the remainder of the day on Thursday . Based on the information recorded in the table below, what should you record as the daily minimum FiO 2 for January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-10 Thursday? In this example, since there is no setting that is maintained for > 1 hour during the calendar day, the daily minimum FiO 2 for Thursday is 0.70 (70%) . This is the lowest value of FiO 2 set on the ventilator during the calendar day. Day Time FiO 2 Thursday : device used to support, assist , or control respiration (inclusive of the weaning period) through the application of positive pressure to the airway when delivered via an artificial airway, specifically oral/nasal endotracheal or tracheostomy tube. Ventilation and lung expansion devices that deliver positive pressure to the airway (for example , CPAP, BiPAP, Bi-level, IPPB , (for example , nasal prongs, nasal mask, full face mask, total mask, etc.) are not considered ventilators unless positive pressure is de livered via an artificial airway (oral/nasal endotracheal or tracheostomy tube). Episode of M echanical Ventilation: Defined as a period of days during which the patient was mechanically ventilated for some portion of each consecutive day. A break in mecha nical ventilation of at least one full calendar day, followed by reintubation and/or reinitiation of mechanical ventilation during the same hospitalization, defines a new episode of mechanical ventilation. EXAMPLE: A patient is intubated and mechanical ventilation is initiated at 11 pm on hospital day 1. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated from hospital days 2 -10. The patient is extubated at 9 am on hospital day 11 and remains extubated on hospital day 12 . The patient is reintubated and mechanical ventilation is reinitiated on hospital day 13 . The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated from hospital day 14 -18. This patient has had two episodes of mechanical ventilation (days 1 -11 and days 13-18), separated by at least one full calendar day off of mechanical ventilation. New Antimicrobial Agent : Defined as any agent listed in the Appendix that is initiated on or after the third calendar day of mechanical ventilation AND in the VAE Window Pe riod (specifically, the period typically defined by the 2 calendar days before, the day of, and the 2 calendar days after the onset date of the VAE ). The agent is considered new for the purposes of this definition if it was NOT given to the patient on either of the 2 days preceding the current start date. January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-11 EXAMPLE: A patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated on hospital day 1 in the surgical ICU ( SICU ). Ceftriaxone and azithromycin are started on day 1 and administered daily . After 3 days of improving respiratory status, the patient's oxygenation deteriorates on days 4 and 5, with a daily minimum PEEP that is 4 cmH 2O higher than it was on days 2 and 3 . Criteria for the VAC definition are met; the date of the event is hospital day 4 . Ceftriaxone is discontinued and meropenem is begun on day 5 . Azithromycin is continued . In this case, meropenem is a new antimicrobial agent: 1) it was begun on day 5 of mechanical ventilation, and 2) within the VAE Wind ow Period (on the day after VAE onset), and 3) it was not given to the patient on either of the 2 days preceding the current start date. By contrast, ceftriaxone and azithromycin would not be considered new antimicrobial agents, since they were begun on day 1 of mechanical ventilation and continued daily into the VAE Window Period . The antimicrobial agent (s) must have been given by one of the routes of administration outlined in Table 1, and therapy with one or more new antimicro bial agents must be continued for at least 4 calendar days (referred to as 4 \"qualifying antimicrobial days\" or \"QADs\") . For further guidance on identification of new antimicrobial agents and on how to determine whether the requirement for 4 QADs i s met, refer to FAQs nos . 6-10 at the end of this protocol . Table 1: Definitions of routes of administration Route of Administrationa Definitionb Intravenous An intravascular route that begins with a vein . Intramuscular A route that begins within a muscle . Digestive Tract A route that begins anywhere in the digestive tract extending from the mouth through rectum. Respiratory Tract A route that begins within the respiratory tract, including the oropharynx and nasopharynx. aOther routes of a dministration are excluded ( for , antibiotic locks, intraperitoneal, intraventricular, irrigation, topical) bDefinitions per SNOMED Reference Terminology Qualifying Antimicrobial Day (QAD) : A day on which the patient was administered an antimicrobial agent determined to be \"new\" within the VAE Window Period. Four consecutive QADs are needed to meet the IVAC antimicrobial criterion\u2014 starting within the VAE Window Period . Days on which a new antimicrobial agent is administered count as QADs . Days between administrations of the same new antimicrobial agent also count as QADs as long as there is a gap of no more than 1 calendar day between administrations. o For example, if levofloxacin is given on VAE Day 1, has not been given in the 2 preceding calendar days, and is given again on VAE Days 3, 5 , and 7, there are 7 QADs \u2014because the days between the levofloxacin doses also count as QADs. Days between administrations of different new antimicrobi al agents do NOT count as QAD s. o For example, if levofloxacin is given to the patient on VAE Days -2 and -1 only, no antimicrobials are given on VAE Day 1, and meropenem is given only on VAE Day 2 January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-12 (remember there is no VAE Day 0), then there are not 4 con secutive QADs. VAE Days -2 and -1 count as 2 consecutive QADs, but VAE Day 1 cannot be counted as a QAD because it is a day between different antimicrobial agents . For further guidance on identification of new antimicrobial agents and on how to determin e whether the requirement for 4 QADs i s met, refer to FAQ nos. 6-10 at the end of this protocol . Purulent Respiratory Secretions : Defined as secretions from the lungs, bronchi, or trachea that contain 25 neutrophils and 10 squamous epithelial cells per low power field [lpf, x100]. Some clinical laboratories may use different results reporting formats for direct examinations of respiratory secretions . Additional instructions for using the purulent respiratory secretions criterion are provided in Table 2 , below (see also FAQ no . 19 at the end of this protocol) . January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-13 Table 2: Instructions for using the purulent respiratory secretions criterion, based on laboratory reporting of respiratory secretion direct examination results. How do I use the purulent respiratory secretions criterion if ... Instruction My laboratory reports counts of \"white blood cells\" or \"polymorphonuclear leukocytes\" or \"leukocytes\" rather than counts of \"neutrophils\" ? Assume that counts of cells identified by these other descriptors (for example, \"white blood cells\") are equivalent to counts of neutrophils , unless the laboratory tells you this is not the case. My laboratory reports semi -quantitative results (not quantitative results) for numbers of neutrophils and squamous epithelial cells? Check with the laboratory to get information about what quantitative ra nges the semi - quantitative reports correspond to. My l aboratory cannot provide additional information on how its semi-quantitative reporting corresponds to quantitative reporting ranges for neutrophils and squamous epithelial cells ? Use the following dire ct examination results to meet the purulent respiratory secretions criterion: many, heavy, numerous, 4+, or 25 neutrophils per low power field (lpf) [x100] , AND no, rare, occasional, few, 1+ or or 10 squamous epithelial cells per lpf [x100] [20]. My laboratory reports only the numbers of neutrophils present, without reporting the number of squamous epithelial cells ? In this situation, the purulent secretions criterion may be met using the specified quantitative and semi -quantitative thresholds for neutrophils alone ( specifically many, heavy, numerous, 4+, or 25 neutrophils per lpf [x100]). My laboratory uses different reporting thresholds for neutroph ils and squamous epithelial cells (for example, maximum report of 20 neutrophils per low power field [x100], or minimum report of 15 squamous epithelial cells per low power field [x100]) ? In this situation, the purulent secretions criterion may be met using the laboratory's specified maximum quantitative threshold for neutrophils, and/or minimum quantitative threshold for squamous epithelial cells. My laboratory processes respiratory specimens such as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid using a centrifugation procedure ( for example, \"cytospin\") , and there is no quantitation or semi -quantitation of neutrophils or white blood cells in the direct examination report? In this situation, a report indicating the presence of white blood cells, without quantitation, is sufficient to meet the purulent secretions criterion. January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-14 Location of Attribution: The inpatient location where the patient was assigned on the date of the VAE, which is further defined as the date of onset of worsening oxygenation. EXAMPLE : Patient is intubated and ventilated in the Operating Room on hospital day 1, and then is admitt ed post -operatively to the SI CU on hospital day 1, still on the ventilator . On hospital day 3, the patient experiences the onset of worsening oxygenation, manifested by an increase in the daily minimum FiO 2 of 0.20 (20 points ). On day 4 (also the 4th day of mechanical ventilation) the patient meets criteria for a VAC . This is reported to NHSN as a VAC for the SICU. EXCEPTION: Transfer Rule : If a VA E develops on the day of transfer or the day following transfer from one inpatient location to another in the same facility or to a new facility (where the day of transfer is day 1), the event is attributed to the transferring location. This is called the Transfer Rule , and examples are shown below . EXAMPLE: Patient on a ventilator in the SICU who has had improving oxygenation for 3 days is transferred to the MICU, still on the ventilator . On the day of transfer, after the patient has arrived in the MICU, the patient experiences an acute decompensation, requiring an increase of 0.30 (30 points) in FiO 2 that persists during the following calendar day . VAC criteria are met on calendar day 2 in the MICU . Because the onset of worsening oxygenation occurred o n the day of transfer to the MICU, the VAC event is attributed to the SICU. EXAMPLE: Patient is extubated in the MICU and transferred to the medical stepdown unit on hospital day 6 . The next day, while in the stepdown unit (day 7), the patient experiences worsening oxygenation and is reintubated and transferred back to the MICU . Criteria for VAC are met the next day (day 8) . In this case, the day prior to extubation and the day of extubation (hospital days 5 and 6) count as the required 2 -day period of stability or improvement . The day of reintubation (day 7) and the following day (day 8) count as the required 2 -day period of worsening oxygenation . Because the onset of worsening oxygenation occurred on the day following transfer out of the MICU, the event is reported to NHSN as a VAC for the MICU. EXAMPLE: Patient intubated and mechanically ventilated for 8 days in the SICU of Hospital A is transferred for further care on day 8 to the MICU o f Hospital B . The patient was stable on the ventilator in Hospital A from days 3 -8. On the day of transfer to Hospital B (day 1 in Hospital B), the patient's respiratory status deteriorates. The patient's respiratory status continues to worsen on the da y after transfer (day 2 in Hospital B), the patient meets criteria for VAC on hospital day 3 . The date of the event is day 2 in Hospital B, the first day of the period of worsening oxygenation meeting VAE PEEP or FiO 2 thresholds . The infection preventionist (IP) from Hospital B calls the Hospital A IP to report that this patient was admitted to Hospital B with a VAC. This VAC should be reported to NHSN for and by Hospital A and attributed to the Hospital A SICU . Date of event was day following transfer . No additional ventilator days are reported by Hospital A. January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-15 Reporting Instructions (additional guidance may be found in the FAQs at the end of this protocol) Conducting in -plan VAE surveillance means assessing patients for the presence of ALL events included in the algorithm - from VAC to IVAC to PVAP . At this time, a unit conducting in -plan VAE surveillance cannot decide, for example, that only surveillance for VAC (and not for IVAC or PVAP) will be performed . There is a hierarchy of definitions within VAE: o If a patient meets criteria for VAC and IVAC, report as IVAC. o If a patient meets criteria for VAC, IVAC , and PVAP, report PVAP. Do not upgrade an event using findings that occur outside the VAE Window P eriod. If the date of event (date of onset of worsening oxygenation) is on or after the date of documentation of evidence of consent AND the patient is being supported for organ donation purposes, the event should not be reported as a VAE . Pathogens are not reported for VAC or IVAC events. Secondary BSIs are not reported for VAC or IVAC events (see FAQ no. 11 at the end of this protocol). Pathogens may be reported for P VAP events, provided they are isolated or identified from appropriate specimen types acc ording to the requirements of the algorithm and are NOT on the list of excluded organisms and culture or non -culture based microbiologic testing method results: o Excluded organisms and culture or non -culture based microbiologic testing method results that cannot be used to meet the P VAP definition are as follows: flora\" or other similar results indicating isolation of commensal flora of the oral cavity or upper respiratory tract Any Candida species or yeast not otherwise specified; any coagulase -negative Staphylococcus species; and bronchoalveolar lavage, or protected specimen brushings These organisms can be reported as PVAP pathogens if identified from lung tissue or pleural fluid (where specimen was obtained during thoracentesis or withi n 24 hours of chest tube placement; pleural fluid specimen s collected after a chest tube is repositioned or from a chest tube in place > 24 hours are not eligible for PVAP ). o Additionally, because organisms belonging to the following genera are typically causes of community -associated respiratory infections and are rarely or are not known to be causes of healthcare -associated infections, they are also excluded, and cannot be used to meet the PVAP definition when isolated from any eligible specimen type (to include lung tissue and are three criteria that can be used to meet the PVAP definition (Figure 1): o Criterion 1: Pos itive culture meeting specific quantitative or semi -quantitative threshold ( Table 3 ); January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-16 o Criterion 2: P urulent respiratory secretions AND identification of organisms NOT meeting the quantitative or semi -quantitative thresholds specified in Table 3 ; o Criterion 3: (one of the following) Organisms identified from pleural fluid specimen (where specimen was obtained duri ng thoracentesis or within 24 hours of chest tube placement; pleural fluid specimen s collected after a chest tube is repositioned or from a chest tube in place > 24 hours are not eligible for PVAP ) Positive lung histopathology Lower respiratory specimen cy tology findings suggestive of infection Positive diagnostic test for Legionella species or selected respiratory viruses . See Table 3 for the required quantitative culture thresholds meeting the PVAP definition (Criterion 1) . Note that if your laboratory reports semi -quantitative culture results, y ou should check with your laboratory to confirm that semi -quantitative results m atch the quanti tative thresholds noted in Table 3 (see also FAQ no . 24 at the end of this protocol ). Table 3: Threshold values for cultured specimens used in the PVAP definition Specimen collection/technique Values Lung tissue 104 CFU/g tissue * Bronchoscopically (B) obtained specimens Bronchoalveolar lavage (B -BAL) 104 CFU/ml* Protected BAL (B -PBAL) Protected specimen brushing (B -PSB) 103 aspirate (ETA) 105 CFU/ml* CFU = colony forming units, g = gram, ml = milliliter *Or corresponding semi -quantitative result (see FAQ no . 24 at the end of this protocol) Secondary BSIs may be reported for PVAP events, provided that at least one organism identified from the blood matches an organism isolated from an appropriate respi ratory tract specimen (including respiratory secretions, pleural fluid, and lung tissue) . The respiratory tract specimen must have been collected on or after the 3rd day of mechanical ventilation and within 2 calendar days before or after the day of onset of worsening oxygenation to be considered for use in meeting the PVAP definition . In addition, the organisms identified from blood must have been collected during the 14 -day event period, where day 1 is the day of onset of worsening oxygenation (See FAQ no. 13 at the end of this protocol). o In cases where P VAP is met with only the histopathology criterion and no culture or non - culture based testing is performed on an eligible respiratory specimen, and there is also a positive blood specimen , a secondary BSI is not reported. o In cases where a culture or non -culture based testing of respiratory secretions, pleural fluid, or lung tissue is performed and does not identify an organism that matches an organism identified from blood, a secondary BS I is not reported . January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-17 o A matching organism is defined as one of the following: 1. If genus and species are identified in both specimens, they must be the same. a. EXAMPLE : A blood specimen resulted with Enterobacter cloacae and a BAL specimen resulted with Enterobacter cloacae are matching organisms. b. EXAMPLE : A blood specimen resulted with Enterobacter cloacae and a BAL specimen resulted with Enterobacter agglomerans are NOT matching organisms as the species are different . 2. If the organism is less definitively identified in one specimen than the other, the lesser identified organism must be identified to at least the genus level and at that level the organisms must be the same. a. EXAMPLE : A BAL resulted with Pseudomonas spp . and a blood specimen resulted with Pseudomonas aeruginosa are considered a match at the genus level and therefore the BSI can be reported as secondary BSI to VAE . EXCEPTION : In cases where an organism is identified only as \"yeast\" or \"yeast not ot herwise specified\", the organism can be considered a match to other yeasts, when collected during the required timeframe, whether more fully identified or not . EXAMPLE : A blood specimen reported as Candida albicans and a lung tissue resulted with yeast not otherwise specified are considered to have matching organisms . In this example the two organisms are considered matching organisms because the organisms are complementary (specifically Candida is a type of yeast) . NOTE : This exception is limited to yeast . It does not apply to identification of organisms as Gram positive cocci, Gram negative rods, etc. Any Candida species or yeast not otherwise specified, any coagulase -negative Staphylococcus species, and any Enterococcus species identifie d from blood cannot be deemed secondary to a P VAP, unless the organism was also identified from pleural fluid or lung tissue. January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 1 0-18 Figure 1: Ventilator -Associated Events (VAE) Surveillance Algorithm Ventilator -Associated Condition (VAC) After a period of stability or improvement on the ventilator, the patient has at least one of the following indicators of wor sening oxygenation: 1) Increase in daily minimum* FiO 2 of 0.20 (20 points) over the daily minimum FiO 2 of the first day in the baseline period, sustained for 2 calendar days. 2) Increase in d aily minimum* PEEP values of 3 cmH 2O over the daily minimum PEEP of the first day in the baseline period, sustained for 2 calendar days . *Daily minimum defined by lowest value of FiO 2 or PEEP during a calendar day that is maintained for > 1 hour. Daily minimum PEEP values of 0 -5 cmH 2O are considered equivalent for the purposes of VAE surveillance. On or after calendar day 3 of mechanical ventilation and within 2 calendar days before or after the onset of worsening oxygen ation, the patient meets both of the following criteria: 1) Temperature > 38 \u00b0C or < 36\u00b0C, OR white blood cell count 12,000 cell s/mm3 or 4,000 cells/mm3. AND 2) A new antimicrobial agent(s) (see Appendix for eligible antimicrobial agents) is started and is continued for 4 qualifying antimicrobial days (QAD) . Infection -related Ventilator -Associated Complication (IVAC) On or after calendar day 3 of mechanical ventilation and within 2 calendar days before or after the onset of worsening oxygenation, ONE of the following criteria is met (taking into account organism exclusions specified in the protocol ): 1) Criterion 1: Positive culture of one of the following specimens, meeting quantitative or semi -quantitative thresholds as outlined in protocol, without requirement for purulent respiratory secretions: Endotracheal aspirate, 105 lavage, 104 CFU/ml or corresponding semi -quantitative result Lung tissue, 104 CFU/g or corresponding semi -quantitative result Protected specimen brush, 103 CFU/ml or corresponding semi -quantitative result 2) Criterion 2: Purulent respiratory secretions ( defined as secretions from the lungs, bronchi, or trachea that contain 25 neutrophils and 10 squamous epithelial cells per low power field [lpf, x100] ) PLUS organism identified from one of the following specimens ( to include qualitative culture, or quantitative/semi -quantitative culture without sufficient growth to meet Criterion #1): Sputum Endotracheal aspirate Bronchoalveolar lavage Lung tissue Protected specimen brush 3) Criterion 3 : One of the following positive tests: Organism identified from pleural fluid (where specimen was obtained during thoracentesis or within 24 hours of chest tube placement; pleural fluid specimens collected after a chest tube is repositioned or from a chest tube in place > 24 hours are not eligible for PVAP ) Lung histopathology, defi ned as: 1) abscess formation foci of consolidation with intense neutrophil accumulation in bronchioles and alveoli; 2) evidence of lung parenchyma invasion by fungi (hyphae, pseudohyphae , or yeast forms); 3) evidence of infection with the viral pathogen s listed below based on results of immunohistochemical assays, cytology, or micr oscopy performed on lung tissue Diagnostic test for Legionella species Diagnostic test on respiratory secretions for influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, coronavirus If the laboratory reports semi -quantitative results, those results must correspond to the quantitative thresholds . Refer to Table 2 and 3. Possible Ventilator -Associated Pneumonia (PVAP) Patient has a baseline period of stability or improvement on the ventilator, defined by 2 calendar days of stable or decreasing daily minimum * FiO 2 or PEEP values . The baseline period is defined as the 2 calendar days immediately preceding the first day of increased daily minimum PEEP or FiO 2. *Daily minimum defined by lowest value of FiO 2 or PEEP during a calendar day that is maintained for > 1 hour. January 2023 Device -associated Mo dule VAE 10-19 Numerator and Denominator Data Numerator Data: The Ventilator -Associated Event (VAE) form (CDC 57.112) is used to collect and report each VA E that is identified during the month selected for surveillance . The Instructions for Completion of Ventilator -Associated Event Form includes brief instructions for collection and entry of each data element on the form. The VAE form includes patient demographic information and information on the start date and location of initiation of mechanical ventilation. Additional data include the specific criteria met for identifying VAE, whether the patient developed a secondary bloodst ream infection, whether the patient died, and , where applicable, the organisms detected and their antimicrobial susceptibilities. Reporting Instruction: If no VAEs are identified during the month of surveillance, the \" Report No Events \" box must be checked on the appropriate denominator summary screen, for example, Denominators for Intensive Care Unit (ICU)/ Other Locations (Not NICU or SCA), etc. Denominator Data: Device days and patient days are used for denominators (see Chapter 16 General Key Terms ). Ventilator days, which are the number s of patients managed with ventilatory device s, are collected daily, at the same time each day, according to the chosen location using the appropriate form (CDC 57.117 [Specialty Care Areas] or 57.118 [ICU/Other Locations] ). These daily counts are summed and only the total for the month is entered into NHSN. Ventilator and patient days are collected for each of the locations monitored . When denominator data are available from electronic sources, these sources may be used as long as the counts are within +/- 5% of manually collected counts, validated for a minimum of 3 consecutive months . Validation of electronic counts should be performed sepa rately for each location conducting VAE surveillance. All ventilator days are counted, including ventilator days for patients on mechanical ventilation for < 3 days, and patients on high frequency ventilation and other therapies excluded from VAE surveilla nce. Patients with tracheostomies who are undergoing weaning from mechanical ventilation using tracheostomy collar trials are included in ventilator day counts if they are on mechanical ventilation at the time when the daily ventilator day count is performed. Patients who are not receiving mechanical ventilation via an artificial airway at the time of the daily ventilator day count are not included. When converting from one electronic counting system to another electronic co unting system, the new electronic system should be validated against manual counts as above . If electronic counts for the new electronic system are not within 5% of manual counts, resume manual counting and continue working with IT staff to improve design of electronic denominator data extraction (while reporting manual counts) until concurrent counts are within 5% for 3 consecutive months. This guideline is important because validating a new electronic counting system against an existing electronic system can magnify errors and result in inaccurate denominator counts. In addition to the total number of patients on ventilator s on each day of surveillance, the number of patients on ventilator s who are on the APRV mode of mechanical ventilation or related mod es (which is a subset of all patients on ventilators) can optionally be indicated on the appropriate form ( CDC 57.117 and 57.118) . See FAQ nos . 22 and 23 at the end of this protocol . January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-20 Collection of an additional denominator, episodes of mechanical ventilation (EMV), is optionally available for VAE surveillance . The EMV denominator represents the sum of the number of episodes of mechanical ventilation that occurred in that location during the month . A single episode of mechanical ventilation for each patient is to be counted only once per month . Do note, it is possible for a patient to have more than one episode of ventilation occur during a month ( for example, discontinuation of mechanical ventilation for greater than 1 calendar day followed by re -initiation of mechanical ventilation). The EMV denominator is determined by counting all patients in the l ocation who are on mechanical ventilation on the first day of the month regardless of eligibility for inclusion in VAE surveillance . Then, on each subsequent day of the month, count each additional patient that is started on mechanical ventilation. This would include those that are admitted to the location already on mechanical ventilation, those that are newly ventilated, and any previously ventilated patients who have new episodes of mechanical ventilation occurring during the same mo nth. The sum of the count for the first day and each subsequent day of the month is entered in NHSN. EXAMPLE: On January 1, there are 5 patients on mechanical ventilation in the MICU (2 patients were started on mechanical ventilation on December 24, 2 pat ients on December 31, and 1 patient on January 1) . During the rest of the month, the following are noted: 1 patient is started on mechanical ventilation on January 8; 2 patients are transferred to the MICU on mechanical ventilation on January 15, and 1 pa tient who was previously ventilated (from January 1 through January 12) goes back on mechanical ventilation on January 20 . No other patients are on mechanical ventilation during the month of January . The number of EMV for January is nine. This is calcul ated as follows: 5 patients (on mechanical ventilation on the first day of the month) + 4 patients who were either started on mechanical ventilation, transferred into the MICU on mechanical ventilation, or re -initiated on mechanical ventilation after being off of the vent for at least 1 calendar day = 9 EMV. January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-21 Data Analyses All data that is entered into NHSN can be analyzed at event or summary level. The data in NHSN can be visualized and analyzed in various ways, specifically , descriptive analysis repo rts for both the denominator and numerator data . Types of VAE Analysis Reports The Standardized Infection Ratio The Standardized Infection Ratio (SIR) is a summary measure used to track HAIs at a national, state, or local level over time . The SIR adjusts for various facility and/or patient -level factors that contribute to HAI risk within each facility . In HAI data analysis, the SIR compares the actual number of HAIs reported to the number that would be predicted, given the standard population ( specifically , the NHSN baseline), adjusting for several risk factors that have been found to be significantly associated with differences in infection incidence . The number of predicted infections in NHSN is calculated based on the 2015 national aggregate da ta and is adjusted for each facility using variables found to be significant predictors of HAI incidence (called as NHSN baseline) . NHSN uses negative binomial regression model to perform the VAE SIR calculations . SIR = () () An SIR will be created for each VAE Category, IVAC Plus , and Total VAE . Total VAE SIR = ++ IVAC Plus SIR = + An SIR greater than 1.0 indicates that more HAIs were observed than predicted; conversely, a SIR less than 1.0 indicates that fewer HAIs were observed than predicted. More information regarding the VAE SIR model and the parameter estimates can be found in The NHSN Guide to the SIR. NOTE: The SIR will be calculated only if the number of predicted VAEs (numPred) is 1 to help enforce a minimum precision criterion. This rule was instituted to avoid the calculation and interpretation of statistically imprecise SIRs, which typically have extr eme values. While the VAE SIR can be calculated for single locations, the measure also allows you to summarize your data by multiple locations, adjusting for differences in the incidence of VAEs among the location types . For example, you can calculate one VAE SIR adjusting for all locations reported . Similarly, you can calculate one VAE SIR for all specialty care areas in your facility. January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-22 The Standardized Utilization Ratio The Standardized Utilization Ratio (SUR) is a summary measure used to track device us e at a national, state, or local, or facility level over time . The SUR adjusts for various facility and/or location -level factors that contribute to device use . The method of calculating a SUR is similar to the method used to calculate the Standardized Infection Ratio (SIR), a summary statistic used in NHSN to track HAIs . In device - associated HAI data analysis, the SUR compares the actual number of device days reported to what would be predicted, given the standard population (specifically, the NHSN baseline), adjusting for several factors that have been found to be significantly associated with differences in device utilization. SUR = () () In other words, a SUR greater than 1.0 indicates that more device days were observed than predicted; conversely, a SUR less than 1.0 indicates that fewer device days were observed than predicted. SURs are currently calculated in NHSN for the following device types: central lines, urinary catheters, and ventilators. More information regarding the VAE SUR model and the parameter estimates can be found at The NHSN Guide to the SUR How to Run and Interpret SUR Reports in NHSN VAE Rate The VAE rate per 1000 ventilator days is calculated by dividing the number of VAEs by the number of ventilator days and multiplying the result by 1000 (ventilator days) . VAE Rate per 1000 ventilator days = . . * 1000 The VAE rate per 100 episodes of mechanical ventilation (EMV) is calculated by dividing the number of VAEs by the number of EMV and multiplying the result by 100 (episodes of mechanical ventilation) . VAE Rate per 100 EMV = . . * 100 Rates and SIRs that may be appropriate for use in public reporting, inter -facility comparisons, and pay -for- reporting/pay -for-performance programs are the overall VAE rate (where the numerator consists of all events meeting at least the VAC definition) . Rates and SIRs that may be appropriate for internal use within an individual unit or facility include the \"IVAC -plus\" rate (where the numerator consists of all events meeting at least the IVAC definition) , and rates of specific event types ( for example, events meeting on ly the VAC definition, events meeting only the IVAC definition, events meeting only the PVAP definition) . The Ventilator Utilization Ratio is calculated by dividing the number of ventilator days by the January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-23 number of patient days . These calculations will be performed separately for the different types of ICUs, SCAs, and oth er locations in the institution . Device Utilization Ratio The Ventilator or Device Utilization Ratio (DUR) is calculated by dividing the number of ventilator days by the number of patient da ys. These calculations will be performed separately for the different types of ICUs, SCAs, and oth er locations in the institution . DUR = . .

Her ndon, VA: ASM -associated Module VAE 10-26 VAE 10-28 VAE Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1) When should I use VAE? Are there circumstances in which I should still use PNEU? VAE surveillance is location based and restricted to adult inpatient units only. Pediatric and neonatal units are excluded from VAE surveillance (even in circumstances where a pediatric unit may occasionally care for patients who are 18 years of age and older) . Locations mapped to mixed age C DC location codes are excluded from VAE surveillance. Ventilated patients who are 18 years of age and older and who are cared for in pediatric units should be included in any in -plan PedVAP and/or PedVAE surveillance for that location. It is NOT recommended to include in VAE surveillance young children housed in adult ICU locations who are not thought to be physiologically similar to the location's adult patient population . Facilities may want to evaluate their location mapping to be sure that locations are mapped appropriately to the correct CDC location codes . In circumstances where the populations of adults and children cared for in the same physical location is more mixed ( for example, 50% adult patients and 50% pediatric patients), it is r ecommended that facilities weigh the possibility of establishing a virtual pediatric location for the purposes of surveillance . More information on virtual locations and location mapping can be found here: Chapter 15 CDC Locations and Descriptions While on high frequency ventilation, extracorporeal life support , or paracorporeal membrane oxygenation, patients are EXCLUDED from VAE surveillance . Patients who are re ceiving a conventional mode of mechanical ventilation while in the prone position and patients who are receiving a conventional mode of mechanical ventilation while receiving nitric oxide therapy, helium -oxygen mixtures (heliox), or epoprostenol therapy ar e INCLUDED. Patients on Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV) and related modes of mechanical ventilation (see FAQ nos . 22 and 23 at the end of this protocol ) are INCLUDED; however, during periods of time while the patient is on APRV, the VAE period of stability or improvement on the ventilator and the period of worsening oxygenation should be determined by changes in FiO 2 only, since changes in PEEP as indicated in this surveillance algorithm may not be applicable to APRV . In addition, patients with VAE who are on APRV or a related mode of mechanical ventilation at the time of VAE onset can be optionally indicated as such on the VAE Form ( CDC 57.112). In-plan surveillance for ventilator -associated PNEU may still be conducted for pediatric patients ONLY (\"PedVAP\" surveillance). The PNEU definitions are still available for those units seeking to conduct off-plan PNEU/VAP surveillance for patients of any age and for assignment of a secondary BSI. January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-29 2) I am having difficulty visualizing how to arrange the VAE data elements to facilitate easy identification of events . Can you provide some additional guidance? For units in which VAE surveillance will be conducted manually, we recommen d that you organize the necessary data elements in a table or spreadsheet to assist in identifying VAEs . There are a number of different ways in which to organize the data - you may consider limiting your spreadsheet to just include the daily minimum PEEP and FiO 2 values, and then, if a VAC event is identified, utilize other data sources to gather information on the data elements included in the IVAC and PVAP definitions . Alternatively, you may choose to include columns for all data elements (from VAC thr ough PVAP) in a single spreadsheet. For most patients under surveillance for VAE, the only data elements you will need to record are the ventilator day s, minimum daily PEEP, and minimum daily FiO 2. The maximum and minimum daily temperatures and white bloo d cell counts only need to be recorded for those patients who are identified as having met criteria for VAC . The antimicrobial criterion only needs to be assessed for those patients with VAC and with an abnormal temperature or white blood cell count that meets the criteria within the IVAC definition . Microbi ology and related data elements included as criteria in the PVAP definition only need to be assessed for those patients who have met the IVAC definition. Keep in mind that th e baseline period of stability or improvement on the ventilator is defined as the 2 calendar days immediately preceding the first day of increased daily minimum PEEP or FiO 2, and must be characterized by 2 calendar days of stable or decreasing daily minimum FiO 2 or PEEP values (specifically the daily minimum PEEP or FiO 2 on the second day of the baseline period of stability or improvement must be equal to or less than the daily minimum PEEP or FiO 2 on the first day of the baseline period of stability or improvement) . Keep in mind, too, that PEEP values of 0 to 5 cmH 2O are considered equivalent for the purposes of VAE surveillance. This means that any daily minimum value of 0 to 5 cmH 2O will be evaluate d as if it were 5 cmH 2O when determining whether a VAC has occurred or not . Also, the daily minimum PEEP or FiO 2 is defined as the lowest setting during a calendar day that is maintained for > 1 hour. EXAMPLE: In the table below, the data elements used to meet VAC, IVAC , and PVAP definition are organized in a fashion that facilitates identification of an event, highlighted in the shaded region . In this example, MV days 3 and 4 constitute the baseline period, w ith stable minimum PEEP of 5 cmH 2O on each day . On MV days 5 and 6, the daily minimum PEEP is 8 cmH 2O, which meets the VAC criterion for worsening oxygenation . If we scan across the table, we can see that the IVAC temperature/white blood cell count crite rion is not met (there are no temperatures < 36\u00b0C or > 38\u00b0C, and no white blood cell counts 4,000 cells/mm3 or 12,000 cells/mm3) - so even though the patient was started on a new antimicrobial agent and continued on that agent for 4 calendar days, IVAC is not met . Therefore, this event would be reported as a VAC, with the date of event being MV day 5.

WBC max = Daily maximum white blood cell count . Abx = antimicrobial and squamous epithelial cells from respiratory specimen. EXAMPLE: In the table below, by scanning across the data elements, you can see that there are no periods in which there is a stable, 2 -day baseline period followed by a 2 -day period where the PEEP or FiO 2 are increased 3 cmH 2O or 20 points over the first day in the baseline period . On MV days 2 and 3, the PEEP values are 7 cmH 2O and 6 cmH 2O respectively, and then increase to 9 cmH 2O on MV days 4 and 5 - but the difference between day 4 or day 5 and day 2 is only 2 cmH 2O, rather than the required 3 cmH 2O. Also, the gradual increase in FiO 2 from the time of initiation of mechanical ventilation means that there are not two days on which the FiO 2 is at least 20 points higher than on the 2 previous days . Therefore, although the temperature and white blood cell counts exceed the required thresholds for IVAC on severa l occasions, and the patient appears to have received a new antimicrobial agent for several days in the setting of a positive blood culture, the VAC definition is not met, and so no VAE is reported. 3) Is there a hierarchy of reporting for VAE? How do I know whether to report a VAC, an IVAC , or a PVAP? Conducting in -plan VAE surveillance means assessing patients for the presence of ALL events included in the algorithm \u2014from VAC to IVAC to PVAP . At this time, a unit participating in in -plan VAE surveillance cannot decide, for example, that only surveillance for VAC (and not for IVAC or PVAP) will be performed .

Can a patient have more than one VAE during a hospitalization? Patients may have multiple VAEs during a single hospitalization . The event period is defined by the 14 -day period that starts on the date of onset of worsening oxygenation . VAE criteria met during that 14 -day period are attributed to the current VAE. EXAMPLE: Patient is intubated and mechanical ventilation is initiated in the M ICU (day 1) . The patient is stable during the following 4 calendar days (days 2 through 5) . On days 6 and 7 the patient's minimum daily FiO 2 is increased more than 0.20 (20 points) over the first day in the baseline period, therefore meeting the VAC FiO 2 threshold . The VAC episode is defined by the period encompassing days 6 through 19 (14 days, starting on day 1 of worsening oxygenation, which in this case is day 6) . If the patient were to experience a period of stability or improvement on the ventilator on days 18 and 19, followed by another 2- day period of worsening on days 20 and 21, a new VAE would be reported, since the second period of worsening oxygenation has occurred more than 14 days after the start of the initial period of worsening oxygenati on. 5) Sometimes patients are intubated, extubated, and reintubated several times during a single hospitalization. How do I define an episode of mechanical ventilation, and can a VAE occur in a patient who has recently been extubated? An episode of mechanic al ventilation is defined as a period of days during which the patient was mechanically ventilated for some portion of each consecutive day during the period. EXAMPLE: A patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated on hospital day 1 . The patient remains on mechanical ventilation from hospital day 2 through 12 noon on hospital day 6 . At noon on hospital day 6, the patient is extubated . The patient remains extubated on hospital day 7 and is then reintubated on hospital day 8 . In this case, the first episode of mechanical ventilation is defined by days 1 through 6 . Since the patient was extubated on day 6 and remained extubated for a full calendar day on day 7, the reintubation of the patient on day 8 defines the start of a second episode of mechanic al ventilation. See figure, below. Hosp Day No. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 MV Episode 1 1 1 1 1 1 -- 2 2 2 MV Day No. 1 2 3 4 5 6\u2014extubated at noon -- 1--reintubated 2 3 EXAMPLE: A patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated on hospital day 1 . The patient remains on mechanical ventilation from hospital day 2 through hospital day 6 at 12 noon . At noon on hospital day 6, the patient is extubated . The patient is reintubated at 9 pm on hospital day 7 and remains intubated and mechanically ventilated till 2 pm on day 10 . The patient is 1 full calendar day off mechanical ventilation, followed by reintubation, defines a new ep isode of mechanical ventilation. January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-32 extubated at 2 pm on day 10 and remains extubated until hospi tal discharge on day 15 . In this case, there is only a single episode of mechanical ventilation, defined by days 1 through 10, because the patient was extubated on day 6 but reintubated the next calendar day (day 7) . See figure, below. Hosp Day No. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 MV Episode 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 MV Day No. 1 2 3 4 5 6\u2014extubated at noon 7\u2014reintubated at 9 pm 8 9 10\u2014extubated at 2 pm A VAE can occur in a patient who has been extubated and is then reintubated, subject to the amount of time the patient was off the ventilator, as noted in the examples below . EXAMPLE: A patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated on hospital day 1 . The patient remains on mechanical ventilation from hospital day 2 through 12 noon on hospital day 6 . At noon on hospital day 6, the patient is extubated . The patient remains extubated on hospital day 7 and is then reintubated on hospital day 8 . In this case, because the patient has been extubated for 1 full calendar day (day 7), the \"VAE clock\" starts over with reintubation on hospital day 8 . To meet VAE during this second episode of mechanical ventilation, the patient would have to have at least 2 days of stability or improvement and at least 2 days of worsening oxygenation on the ventilator; therefore, the earliest date on which the patient could meet VAE criteria would be hospital day 11 (stable or improving settings on days 8 and 9, increased ventilator settings on days 10 and 11) . The VAE date of event would be reported as day 10 \u2014the first day of worsening oxygenation meeting VAE criteria . See figure, below. EXAMPLE: A patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated on hospital day 1 . The patient remains on mechanical ventilation from hospital day 2 through 12 noon on hospital day 6, when the patient is extubated . The patient is reintubated at 9 pm on hospital day 7 . In this case, there is no \"new\" episode of mechanical ventilation, since there was not a full, ventilator -free calendar day. Therefore, the period of wo rsening oxygenation may be determined to have started on day 7, the day of reintubation, as long as PEEP or FiO 2 criteria are met . PEEP and FiO 2 data from hospital days 5 and 6 (through the time of extubation) may be used to determine whether a period of stability and improvement occurred, and these data may be compared to PEEP and FiO 2 data obtained from the time of reintubation on day 7 and beyond to determine whether at least 2 days of worsening oxygenation occurred . The earliest that the patient could meet VAE criteria would be day 8 (assuming stable or improving ventilator settings on days 5 and 6, and two days of Hosp Day No. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 MV Episode 1 1 1 1 1 1 -- 2 2 2 2 MV Day No. 1 2 3 4 5 6 - extubated at noon -- 1 - reintubated 2 3 4 VAE Criterion -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Day 1 of stability or improvement Day 2 of stability or improvement Day 1 of worsening oxygenation Day 2 of worsening oxygenation Patient was reintubated on the calendar day following extubation (days 6 -7). Because there is not 1 calendar day off mechanical ventilation, there is only 1 episode of mechanical ventilation . January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-33 worsening oxygenation meeting criteria on days 7 and 8) . The VAE date of event would be reported as day 7\u2014 the first day of worsening oxyge nation meeting VAE criteria . See figure, below. Hosp Day No. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 MV Episode 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 MV Day No. 1 2 3 4 5 6 - extubated at noon 7 - reintubated at 9 pm 8 9 10 VAE Criterion -- -- -- -- Day 1 of stability or improvement Day 2 of stability or improvement Day 1 of worsening oxygenation Day 2 of worsening oxygenation -- -- A patient may also meet criteria for VAC while intubated, and then meet criteria for IVAC (or PVAP) following extubation. EXAMPLE: A patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated on hospital day 1 . The patient remains on mechanical ventilation till 11 am on hospital day 10, when the patient is extubated . Criteria for VAC are met during the episode of mechanical ventilation, based on 2 days of stability or improvement (MV days 5 and 6) followed by 2 days of worsening oxygenation (MV days 7 and 8). The date of the event is MV day 7, the day of onset of worsening oxygenation . Within the 2 days before and 2 days after the day of onset of worsening oxygenation, the patient has a temperature of 38.4\u00b0C, and a new antimicrobial agent is started (meropenem, on MV day 9 \u2014see FAQ no s. 6-10 at the end of this protocol) . The new antimicrobial agent is continued for at least 4 days (hospital days 8 through 11) . Therefore, even though the patient was extubated on hospital day 10 and remained extubated on hospital d ay 11 (the day on which all IVAC criteria were fulfilled), the event should be reported as an IVAC . See figure, below. Hosp Day No. 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 MV Day No. 4 5 6 7 8 9 Extubated at 11 am -- VAE Criterion -- Day 1 of stability or improvement Day 2 of stability or improvement Day 1 of worsening oxygenation Day 2 of worsening oxygenation in the IVAC definition? See the Appendix for a list of the antimicrobial agents eligible for consideration in the IVAC definition (as well as the PVAP definition). See Table 1 for eligible routes of administration. 7) How do I figure out if an antimicrobial agent is \"new \" for the IVAC definition? A new antimicrobial agent is defined as any agent listed in the Appendix that is initiated on or after 3 days of mechanical ventilation AND in the VAE Window Period (defined by the two days Patient has fulfilled all IVAC criteria, and IVAC should be reported. Date of the IVAC event is hospital day/MV day 7. January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-34 before, the day of, and the two days after the onset date of the VAE \u2014as long as all of these days are on or after the 3rd day of mechanical ventilation) . The agent is considered new for the purposes of this definition if it was NOT given to the patient on either of the 2 days preceding the current start date . The agent must be administered via one of the routes listed in Table 1 . See the example in the figure below: MV Day No. 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 VAE Criterion - - - Onset (day 1) of worsening oxygenation meeting VAE PEEP or FiO 2 thresholds Day 2 of worsening oxygenation meeting VAE PEEP or FiO 2 thresholds - - - EXAMPLE: A single dose of intravenous vancomycin is given to a patient on the VAE onset date (which is the day of onset of worsening oxygenation meeting VAE criteria, in this case MV day 7), and was not given to the patient during the 2 previous days (MV d ays 5 and 6) . Vancomycin is therefore considered a new antimicrobial agent . See figure, below . MV Day No. 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 VAE Criterion -- Day 1 of stability or improvement Day 2 of stability or improvement Day 1 of worsening oxygenation Day 2 of worsening oxygenation - - Antimicrobial agent None None None Single dose of vancomycin ordered and administered None None Single dose of vancomycin ordered and administered EXAMPLE: If meropenem is given to a patient on the VAE onset date (which is the day of onset of worsening oxygenation meeting VAE criteria, in this case MV day 7), and was not given to the patient during the 2 previous days (MV days 5 and 6), then meropenem is considered a new antimicrobial agent (see figure below) . Note that the patient is also receiving ceftriaxone and receives doses during the 5 -day period around the onset of worsening oxygenation (first dose during the 5 -day period was on MV day 5) . However, because ceftriaxone was given to the patient the day before the 5 -day period (on MV day 4), ceftriaxone does not count as a new antimicrobial agent for the purposes of the IVAC definition. MV Day No. 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 VAE Criterion -- Day 1 of stability or improvement Day 2 of stability or improvement Day 1 of worsening oxygenation Day 2 of worsening meropenem during the 5 -day period around the onset of worsening oxygenation . Note that no meropenem was given in the 2 preceding days, and so meropenem is a \"new\" antimicrobial agent for the purposes of the VAE definition. Example of the 5-day period during which the first dose of a new antimicrobial agent must be given to meet requirements of IVAC definition A single dose of vancomycin is ordered and administered to the patient within the period defined by the two days before, the day of, and the two days after the VAE onset date . Note that no vancomycin was given in the 2 preceding days, and so vancomycin is a \"new\" antimicrobial agent for the purposes of the VAE definition. January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-35 8) I have figured o ut that a new antimicrobial agent was given to the patient . How do I determine whether it was continued for 4 days? Make sure you are using the Medication Administration Record . You need to know which antimicrobial agents were actually administered to th e patient . Antimicrobial orders or dispensing information is not sufficient . You do not need to know the dose or frequency of administration. Four consecutive Qualifying Antimicrobial Days (QADs) \u2014starting within the VAE Window Period\u2014 are needed to meet the IVAC criterion . A QAD is a day on which the patient was administered an antimicrobial agent that was determined to be \"new \" within the VAE Window Period. Days between administrations of a new antimicrobial agent also count as QADs as long as there is a gap of no more than 1 calen dar day between administrations of the same antimicrobial agent . For example, if levofloxacin is given on VAE Day 1, has not been given in the 2 preceding calendar days, and is given again on VAE Days 3, 5 , and 7, there are 7 QADs \u2014because the days between levofloxacin doses also count as QADs. The requirement for 4 consecutive QADs can be met with 4 days of therapy with the same antimicrobial (with a gap of no more than 1 calendar day between administrations of that antimicrob ial)\u2014or it can be met with 4 days of therapy with multiple antimicrobial agents, as long as each antimicrobial was started within the VAE Window Period. EXAMPLE: In the figure below, meropenem would meet the antimicrobial criterion of the IVAC definition because at least one dose was given on 4 consecutive days. MV Day No. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 VAE Criterion -- Day 1 of Stability or improvement Day 2 of stability or improvement Day 1 of worsening oxygenation Day 2 of worsening Yes Yes Yes Yes EXAMPLE: In the figure below, the 3 drugs shown in bold lettering all qualify as new antimicrobial agents, and therefore the antimicrobial criterion of IVAC is met, since the patient is given 4 consecutive days of new antimicrobial agents. MV Day No. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 VAE Criterion -- Day 1 of Stability or improvement Day 2 of stability or improvement Day 1 of worsening oxygenation Day 2 of worsening Yes Yes Yes EXAMPLE: In the figure below, levofloxacin is a new antimicrobial agent (it was started during the VAE Window Period, on MV day 3, and was not given in the 2 days preceding the first day of administration) . There are gaps of no more than 1 calendar days between days on which levofloxacin is given, and so the intervening days also count as QADs. In this example, there are 5 QADs (MV days 3 -7); therefore , the antimicrobial criterion of IVAC is met. January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-36 MV Day No. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 VAE Criterion -- Day 1 of Stability or improvement Day 2 of stability or improvement Day 1 of worsening oxygenation Day 2 of worsening oxygenation -- --- Antimicrobial agent -- -- Levofloxacin -- Levofloxacin -- Levofloxacin QAD No No Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes 9) There are many patients in my ICU with renal insufficiency and/or who are receiving hemodialysis . These patients may receive certain antimicrobial agents on an infrequent dosing schedule (for example, every 48 hours) . How do I determine whether they have received 4 consecutive days of new antimicrobial therapy? See above . You do not need to know the patient's renal function, the dose of the antimicrobial agent, or the frequency of administration . The antimicrobial criterion rules remain the same, regardless of whether patients have rena l dysfunction or not . 10) What if the patient is being given one- time doses of intravenous vancomycin? How do I take that into account when using the IVAC surveillance definition? The rules for determining whether the antimicrobial criterion is met do not r equire that you know the dose or frequency of administration . Make sure that vancomycin qualifies as a new antimicrobial agent \u2014that it was not given in the 2 days preceding the day on which vancomycin was given during the VAE Window Period. Check to see whether there are 4 consecutive QADs with vancomycin; if there are gaps of no more than 1 calendar day between days on which vancomycin is given, the intervening days may be counted as QADs . If there are gaps of longer than 1 calendar day between days of vancomycin therapy, the requirement for 4 consecutive QADs cannot be met using vancomycin alone\u2014 but make sure to check whether the 4 consecutive QAD requirement is met by considering any other antimicrobials being administered to the patient . See the exam ple in the figure below . EXAMPLE: A patient is given a single dose of vancomycin 1 gram IV on MV day 5 . Since vancomycin was started on or after day 3 of mechanical ventilation, and no vancomycin was administered on MV days 2, 3 , or 4, vancomycin qualifies as a new antimicrobial agent . A second, single dose of vancomycin 1 gram IV is administered on MV day 8 . Because there is a gap of more than 1 calendar day between days of vancomycin administration (there is a gap of 2 days in this example), the requirement for 4 consecutive QADs is not met, and therefore the IVAC antimicrobial criterion is not met . MV Day No. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 VAE Criterion -- -- Day 1 of Stability or improvement Day 2 of stability or improvement Day 1 of worsening oxygenation Day 2 of worsening oxygenation - - Antimicrobial agent None None None Vancomycin 1 gram IV x 1 dose None None Vancomycin 1 gram IV x 1 dose None QAD No No No Yes No No Yes No January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-37 11) Can I report pathogens or secondary BSIs for VAC and IVAC? Pathogens are NOT reported for VAC or IVAC events. Secondary BSIs are NOT reported for VAC or IVAC events . EXAMPLE: A patient hospitalized and mechanically ventilated in the MICU for 14 days dev elops worsening oxygenation following a 7 -day period of stability on the ventilator . VAC criteria are met on hospital day 15 (stable ventilator settings on days 12 and 13, increased ventilator settings on days 14 and 15) . The onset date is day 14 . The w hite blood cell count is noted to be 15,500 cells/mm3 on day 14 . Meropenem and intravenous vancomycin are begun on day 15, administered through the patient's right -sided central line, which was inserted on ICU admission. The antibiotics continue to be ad ministered on day 18, meeting IVAC criteria . Endotracheal aspirate cultures done on days 15 and 16 grow scant upper respiratory flora . A blood culture collected on day 15 is positive for Klebsiella oxytoca. There are no other signs or symptoms of infect ion. This patient should be reported as having an IVAC and a central line- associated BSI if the BSI cannot be attributed as secondary to another primary site of infection . The BSI cannot be reported as secondary to the IVAC event. 12) Can I report p athogens for P VAP? Pathogens may be reported for PVAP events, provided they are isolated or identified from appropriate specimen types according to the requirements of the algorithm and are NOT on the list of excluded organisms and culture results: o Excluded organisms and culture results that cannot be used to meet the PVAP definition are as follows: flora\" or other similar results indicating isolation of commensal flora of the oral cavity or upper respiratory tract; any Candida species or yeast not otherwise specified; any coagulase -negative Staphylococcus species; and any es, or protected specimen brushings . Only eligible pathogens identified from eligible specimens with a collection date occurring in the VAE Window Period can be reported . NOTE: When any Candida species or yeast not otherwise spec ified, any coagulase -negative Staphylococcus species , or any Enterococcus species are identified from lung tissue or pleural fluid, these organisms may be reported as PVAP pathogens. Additionally, because organisms belonging to the following genera are usually causes of community -associated respiratory infections and rarely or are not known to be causes of healthcare -associated infections , they are also excluded, and cannot be used to meet the PVAP definition when isolated from any eligible specimen type (t o include lung tissue and pleural fluid) : Blastomyces, Histoplasma, Coccidioides, Paracoccidioides, Cryptococcus , and See Table 3 for the required quantitative culture thresholds associated with various specimen types in the PVAP definition. Note that if your laboratory reports semi -quantitative culture results, y ou should check with your laboratory to confirm that semi-quantitativ e results match the quanti tative thresholds noted in Table 3. January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-38 13) Can I report secondary BSIs for P VAP? Secondary BSIs may be reported for P VAP events, provided that the organism identified from blood specimen matches an organism identified from an appropriate respiratory tract specimen (including respiratory secretions, pleural fluid, and lung tissue) . The respiratory tract specimen must have been collected within 2 calendar days before or after the day of onset of worsening oxygenation to be considered as a criterion for meeting the P VAP definition. In addition, the positive blood specimen must have been collected during the 14 -day event period, where day 1 is the day of onset of worsening oxyg enation. o In cases where P VAP is met with only the histopathology criterion and no culture or non - culture based test is performed on an eligible respiratory specimen , and there is also a positive blood specimen , a secondary BSI for VAE is not reported . o In cases where a culture or non -culture based test of respiratory secretions, pleural fluid , or lung tissue is performed and does not identify an organism that matches an organism identified from blood, a secondary BSI for VAE is not reported. NOTE: Any Candida species or yeast not otherwise specified, any coagulase -negative Staphylococcus species, and any Enterococcus species identified from blood cannot be deemed secondary to a P VAP, unless the organism was also identified from pleural fluid or lung tissue. EXAMPLE: Patient hospitalized and mechanically ventilated in the MICU for 14 days develops worsening oxygenation following a 7 -day period of stability on the ventilator . VAC criteria are met on hospital day 15 (stable ventilator settings o n days 12 and 13, increased ventilator settings on days 14 and 15) . The onset date is day 14 . The white blood cell count is noted to be 15,500 cells/mm3 on day 14 . Meropenem and vancomycin are begun on day 15, administered through the patient's right -sided central line (inserted on ICU admission) . The antibiotics continue to be administered on day 18, meeting IVAC criteria . Endotracheal aspirate specimens collected on days 15 and 16 grow 105 CFU/ml Klebsiella oxytoca . A blood culture collected on da y 15 is positive for K . oxytoca . This patient should be reported as having a PVAP with a secondary BSI due to K . oxytoca . EXAMPLE: Patient hospitalized and mechanically ventilated in the MICU for 14 days develops worsening oxygenation following a 7 -day period of stability on the ventilator . VAC criteria are met on hospital day 15 (stable ventilator settings on days 12 and 13, increased ventilator settings on days 14 and 15) . The onset date is day 14 . The white blood cell count is noted to be 15,500 cells/mm3 on day 14 . Meropenem and vancomycin are begun on day 15, administered through the patient's right -sided central line (inserted on ICU admission) . The antibiotics continue to be administered on day 18, meeting IVAC criteria . A thoracentesis is performed on day 15 at the patient's bedside using aseptic technique. Pleural fluid is sent for culture and grows Candida albicans . A blood culture collected on day 16 is positive for C . albicans . This patient should be reported as having a PVAP wi th a secondary BSI due to C . albicans. EXAMPLE: Patient hospitalized and mechanically ventilated in the MICU for 14 days develops worsening oxygenation following a 7 -day period of stability on the ventilator . VAC criteria are met on hospital day 15 (stab le ventilator settings on days 12 and 13, increased ventilator settings on days 14 and 15) . The onset date is day 14 . The white blood cell count is noted to January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-39 be 15,500 cells/mm3 on day 14 . Meropenem and vancomycin are begun on day 15, administered throug h the patient's right -sided central line (inserted on ICU admission) . The antibiotics continue to be administered on day 18, meeting IVAC criteria . An endotracheal aspirate collected on day 15 is a good quality specimen, with 25 neutrophils and 10 squamous epithelial cells per low power field and grows Staphylococcus aureus (qualitative result) . A blood culture collected on day 24 is positive for S . aureus and for coagulase - negative staphylococci (CoNS) . This patient should be reported as having a PVAP, with S . aureus reported as the pathogen . A secondary BSI should also be reported for the PVAP, since the positive blood culture was collected within the 14 -day period of the VAE, and an organism isolated from blood ( S. aureus ) matched an organism isolated from culture of the endotracheal aspirate . The CoNS also isolated from the blood culture on day 24 is not reported as a pathogen for the PVAP because it is an excluded organism. 14) Can I only report pathogens if they are isolated in cultures of appropriate specimens? What about pathogens identified by non -culture-based diagnostic testing? PVAP incorporates results of non -culture -based microbiological diagnostic testing. For PVAP, pathogens that are grown in culture OR selected pathogens that are identified as a result of other laboratory testing (for example, antigen testing, PCR, immunohistochemistry, etc.) should be reported. Do not limit reporting to just those organisms isolated in culture. For example, influenza A identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a patient meeting PVAP criteria should be reported as a pathogen for that event. 15) The \" PVAP\" Criterion 3 includes \"positive diagnostic tests\" for Legionella species, and selected viruses. What kinds of diagnostic tests can be used to meet the definition? Diagnostic testing practices may vary from facility to facility and change over time as better tests are developed. Listed here are some examples of diagnostic tests for specific pathogens included in the PVAP definitio n. Positive results of these tests may be used in meeting the PVAP definition. Your facility may use other testing methods; positive results obtained using these methods may also be appropriate for use in meeting the PVAP definition . If you have a quest ion regarding a diagnostic test method, check with your laboratory. For Legionella species, positive results of any of the following, performed on the appropriate specimen: urinary antigen, Legionella-specific respiratory culture, paired serology (4 -fold r ise in titer between acute and convalescent specimens), direct fluorescent antibody stain, immunohistochemistry stain, or nucleic acid detection assays (such as PCR) performed on a respiratory specimen. For respiratory viruses (influenza, respiratory syncy tial virus [RSV], parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses, adenovirus), positive results for any of the following: o Performed on an appropriate respiratory specimen - PCR or other viral nucleic acid detection methods, antigen detection methods, including rapid tests, viral cell culture, or o Performed on appropriate pathologic specimens - immunohistochemical assays, cytology, microscopy, or o Performed on appropriately timed paired sera (acute and convalescent) - serologica l assays demonstrating seroconversion or a significant rise in antibody titer . January 2023 Device-associated Module VAE 10-40 16) What about pneumonitis that occurs in a mechanically -ventilated patient and is determined to be due to herpes simplex virus (HSV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV)? Can these infections be reported as VAEs? In most cases pneumonitis due to HSV and CMV represents reactivation of a latent infection, and therefore would not be considered healthcare -associated, according to the NHSN definition of a healthcare -associated infection . As it re lates to VAE surveillance, laboratory confirmation of HSV or CMV would not be used to meet PVAP. 17) Are there any culture results or microorganisms that CANNOT be used to meet the PVAP definition? The following pathogens and culture results may NOT be used t o meet the definition and may NOT be reported as causes of PVAP when they are identified from sputum, endotracheal aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage s, or protected specimen brushings o Culture results reported as \"Normal respiratory flora,\" \"altered oral flora, \" or other similar results indicating isolation of commensal flora of the oral cavity or upper respiratory tract o Any Candida species or yeast not otherwise specified o Any c oagulase -negative Staphylococcus species o Any Enterococcus species NOTE: These organisms are excluded because they are common upper respiratory tract commensals, colonizers , or contaminants, and are unusual cau ses of VAP . Their exclusion from the surveillance definitions should NOT be used in clinical decision -making regarding patient treatment. Providers must independently determine the clinical significance of these organisms identified from respiratory spec imens and the need for treatment. NOTE: When any Candida species or yeast not otherwise specified, any coagulase -negative Staphylococcus species or any Enterococcus species are identified from lung tissue or pleural fluid, these organisms may be reported as PVAP pathogens. Additionally, because organisms belonging to the following genera are typically causes of community -associated respiratory infections and are rarely or are not known to be causes of healthcare -associated infections , they are also excluded, and cannot be used to meet the PVAP definition when isolated from any eligible specimen type (to include lung tissue and pleural fluid) : or protected specimen brushing culture or non -culture based testing results are mixed and contain one or more of the excluded pathogens in addition to one or more non-excluded pathogens, the culture may be used to meet the PVAP definition (depending on whether a qualitative, semi -quantitative , or quantitative culture was performed, and whether the semi -quantitative or quantitative CFU /ml thresholds were met) BUT only the non-excluded pathogen(s) should be reported. EXAMPLE: Patient intubated and mechanically ventilated in the SICU meets IVAC criteria on day 8 of mechanical ventilation. On the day after the onset of worsening oxygenation, an endotracheal aspirate is collected. The Gram stain shows 25 neutrophils and 10 squamous epithelial cells per low power field, and the culture grows \"heavy Staphylococcus aureus \" and \"heavy Candida albicans .\" This patient should be reported as having a PVAP ( Criterion 1) due to Staphylococcus aureus - as long as the semi-quant itative result \"heavy\" is equivalent to the quantitative threshold of 10 5 CFU/ml for endotracheal aspirates. If the semi -quantitative result is not January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-41 equivalent to the quantitative threshold of 105 CFU/ml for endotracheal aspirates , the patient should s till reported as PVAP ( Criterion 2) . Candida albicans from the endotracheal aspirate culture is not reported, because it is an excluded result. 18) What about organisms identified from pleural fluid and lung tissue specimens? Can I report any pathogen ide ntified from a lung tissue, or from a pleural fluid specimen, assuming the specimen was obtained during thoracentesis or within 24 hours of chest tube insertion? Any pathogen identified from lung tissue, when that lung tissue was obtained during an open lu ng biopsy, video -assisted thoracoscopic surgery, or via other transthoracic or transbronchial biopsy approach, may be reported with the exception of the excluded pathogens belonging to the pleural fluid, when that fluid was obtained during thoracentesis or within 24 hours of chest tube insertion (where there was no repositioning of the chest tube prior to specimen collection) , may be reported with the exception of the excluded pathogens belonging to the defined? Purulent respiratory secretions used to meet Criterion 2 of the PVAP definition are defined as: o Secretions from the lungs, bronchi, or trachea with 25 neutrophils and 10 squamous epithelial cells per low power field [lpf, x100] . o If the laboratory reports semi -quantitative results, y ou should check with you r laboratory to be certain that the semi -quantitative results match the quanti tative thresholds noted above. If your laboratory is not able to provide additional information on how a semi -quantitative reporting system corresponds to quantitative reporting ranges for neutrophils and squamous epithelial cells, here is some guidance from the Clinical Microbiology Pr ocedures Handbook (3rd ed., 2010)*: 1+ = o ccasional or rare = < 1 cell per low power field [lpf, x100] 2+ = few = 1 -9 cells per low power field [lpf, x100] 3+ = moderate = 10 -25 cells per low power field [lpf, x100] 4+ = heavy = > 25 cells per low power field [lpf, x100] *Reference: Garcia, LS (Ed.) Handbook . Herndon, VA: ASM Press, page 3.2.1.16. o With this range in mind, and in the absence of additional information from your laboratory, \"purulent respiratory secretions\" are defined as secretions that co ntain many, heavy, numerous, 4+ or 25 neutrophils per low power field [lpf, x100] AND no, rare, occasional, few, 1+ or 2+, or 10 squamous epith elial cells per low power field [lpf, x100] . If your laboratory uses a different reporting format for results of direct examination of respiratory secretions, you may still be able to use the purulent respiratory secretions in meeting the PVAP definition . See the instructions available in the VAE Protocol, Table 2 . January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-42 20) What is the definition of \"positive lung histopathology\" that can be used to meet the P VAP definition? If the lung tissue specimen was obtained via open lung biopsy, video -assisted thoracoscopic surgery, or via other transthoracic or transbronchial biopsy approach, i t is eligible for consideration in meeting the PVAP definition (Criterion 3) . Histopathological findings that can be used to meet the PVAP definition include: o Abscess formation or foci of consolidation with intense neutrophil accumulation in bronchioles and alveoli; o Evidence of lung parenchy ma invasion by fungi (hyphae, pseudohyphae, or yeast forms); o Evidence of infection with the viral pathogens listed in FAQ no . 15 (above ) based on results of immunohistochemical assays, cytology, or microscopy performed on lung tissue. Additionally, lower respiratory specimen cytology findings suggestive of infection are eligible for consideration in meeting the PVAP definition (Criterion 3). 21) I am still having trouble understanding the time frame that defines a VAE . Can you explain what is meant by this statement that appears in the algorithm: \"On or after calendar day 3 of mechanical ventilation and within 2 calendar days bef ore or after the onset of worsening oxygenation\" ? The intent of these criteria is to determine whether a VAC is due to an infectious process (IVAC) and/or pneumonia (PVAP) by looking for corroborating inflammatory and infectious signs at the time of VAC onset . The criterion, \"on or after calendar day 3\" is intended to exclude inflammatory and infectious signs present on the first two days of mechanical ventilation because they are more likely to be due to pre -existing conditions than ventilator -acquired complications . The criterion, \"within 2 calendar days before or after the onset of worsening oxygenation,\" is intended to identify infectious and inflammatory signs that arise at the same time as VAC and may therefore point to the cause of the VAC . The figures below illustrate the time frame that defines a VAE . The date of event is the first day of worsening oxygenation, defined by the PEEP and FiO 2 thresholds outlined in the algorithm . The date of event defines the time frame within which all other cr iteria must be met . In the examples below, the shaded area defines the VAE Window Period in which IVAC criteria (temperature or white count abnormalities, plus a new antimicrobial agent started and continued for at least 4 days) must be met, and in which a PVAP criterion must be met. Keep in mind that VAE criteria must be met based on specimens collected or antimicrobial agents started after day 2 of mechanical ventilation. EXAMPLE 1: When the onset date of the VAE occurs early in the course of mechanical ventilation (for example, day 3 or 4 of mechanical ventilation), the period in which certain inflammatory and infectious criteria are sought for IVAC and PVAP is shorter, because the first 2 days of mechanical ventilation are excluded from the normal 5 -day window surrounding the day of increased ventilator support. January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-43 MV Day No. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Worsening oxygenation -- Day 1 of Stability or improvement Day 2 of stability or improvement Day 1 of worsening oxygenation Day 2 of worsening oxygenation - - Temperature abnormality or white blood cell count abnormality - - An abnormal temperature or white blood cell count, according to the algorithm parameters, must be documented within this shaded period - Antimicrobial agent - - New agent must be started on any day within this shaded period, and then continued for at least 4 days - Purulent respiratory secretions, positive culture, positive histopathology - - Specimen must be collected on any day within this shaded period - EXAMPLE 2: When the onset date of the VAE occurs later in the course of mechanical ventilation, the period in which certain criteria must be met is a day longer, because the patient has already been on mechanical ventilation for more than 3 days and therefore inflammatory and infectious signs arising anywhere in the full 5 -day window surrounding the day of increased ventilator settings can count towards IVAC and PVAP. MV Day No. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Worsening oxygenation -- Day 1 of Stability or improvement Day 2 of stability or improvement Day 1 of worsening oxygenation Day 2 of worsening oxygenation - - Temperature abnormality or white blood cell count abnormality - An abnormal temperature or white blood cell count, according to the algorithm parameters, must be documented within this shaded period - Antimicrobial agent - New agent must be started on any day within this shaded period, and then continued for at least 4 days - Purulent respiratory secretions, positive culture, positive histopathology - Specimen must be collected on any day within this shaded period - 22) Providers in my ICU use different types of mechanical ventilation for different patients . Can you explain the circumstances in which mechanically -ventilated patients are to be excluded from VAE surveillance, and the circumstances in which mechanically-ventilated patients should be included in VAE surveillance? VAE surveillance is restricted to adult inpatient locations . Patients on mechanical ventilation who are in adult inpatient locations in acute care and long -term acute care hospitals and inpatient rehabilitation facilities are eligible for inclusion in VAE surveillance . Patients are excluded from VAE surveillance during periods of time when they are receiving high frequency ventilation, or if they are receiving extracorporeal life support or paracorporeal membrane oxygenation (for example extracorporeal membrane oxygenati on - ECMO) . Patients may be on these types of support for a portion of a calendar day, but not for the entire calendar day. In these instances, the patient is eligible for inclusion in VAE surveillance during the portion of the calendar day when the pati ent was being mechanically ventilated using a conventional type of mechanical ventilation. Ventilator settings documented while on a conventional mode of ventilation are to be used to select daily minimum PEEP and FiO 2 values for the calendar day. Patient s are included in surveillance if they are on a ventilator (as defined in the VAE surveillance protocol) and are being mechanically ventilated through an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube January 2023 Device -associated Module VAE 10-44 using a conventional mode of mechanical ventilation (such as volume controlled, pressure controlled, or pressure support mechanical ventilation). o Patients on conventional m echanical ventilation who are receiving nitric oxide, helium - oxygen mixtures (heliox) , or epoprostenol therapy are included in surveillance. o Patients on conventional mechanical ventilation who are being ventilated in the prone position are included in surv eillance. Patients are also included in surveillance if they are on a ventilator (as defined in the VAE surveillance protocol) and are being mechanicall y ventilated through an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube using Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV) or related modes . Some terms that are used to indicate APRV or a related mode of mechanical ventilation include (but may not be limited to): BiLevel, Bi Vent, BiPhasic, PCV+, and DuoPAP. o For patients on APRV or related modes the entire calendar day, the period of worsening oxygenation following a period of stability or improvement on the ventilator that is required for identification of a VAE will be defined by the FiO 2 criterion within the VAE surveillance definition algorithm . The PEEP criterion may not be applicable in patients on APRV or related modes of mechanical ventilation . o For patients on APRV or related modes for a portion of the calendar day identification of a VAE can be determined in either the PEEP or FiO 2 parameter . However, only ventilator settings documented during the calendar day while on a conventional mode of ventilation are to be used to select the daily minimum PEEP. If you ha ve questions about mechanical ventilation, you should check with the Respiratory Care or Respiratory Therapy and/or Critical Care departments in your facility. 23) Do I need to indicate if a patient was on APRV at the time of VAE onset, and do I need to indic ate the number of patients on APRV in my ICU for each day of VAE surveillance? If the VAE occurred in a patient on Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV) or a related mode of mechanical ventilation (for example, BiLevel, Bi Vent, BiPhasic, PCV+, DuoPAP ) at the time of VAE onset, responding \"Yes\" in the \"APRV\" field is optional on the VAE Form ( CDC 57.112) . Otherwise, indicate \"No.\" On appropriate denominator form ( CDC 57.117 or 57.118) , in the column for \"Number of patients on a ventilator,\" you will see that the re are two sub -columns . In the sub -column, \"Total patients,\" enter the total number of patients on a ventilator on that day . It is optional to provide the \"Number on APRV,\" in the sub -column . If provided, enter the number for the subset of patients on a ventilator on that day who are on the APRV mode of mechanical ventilation or related modes (for example, BiLevel, Bi Vent, BiPhasic, PCV+, DuoPAP) at the time the count is performed . If there are no patients on APRV or a related mode of mechanical ventil ation, enter \"0\" (zero) . 24) My laboratory only performs semi -quantitative cultures of lower respiratory tract specimens and cannot provide me with additional guidance to help me know what semi -quantitative culture result corresponds to the quantitative thr esholds specified in Criterion 1 of the PVAP definition . Can you provide more information? For the purposes of this surveillance, and in the absence of additional information available from your laboratory, a semi -quantitative result of \"moderate\" \"many\" \"numerous\" or \"heavy\" 3+ or 4+ growth, meets the PVAP definition (Criterion 1). January 202 3 11-1 Pediatric Ventilator-Associated Event (Ped VAE) For use in neonatal and pediatric locations only Table of Contents Introduction .................................................................................................................................................. 1 Settings ......................................................................................................................................................... 3 Inclusion and Exclus ion Criteria .................................................................................................................... 3 Definitions .................................................................................................................................................... 4 Figure 1: Pediatric Ventilator -Associated Events (PedVAE) Surveillance Algorithm .................................... 8 Reporting Instructio ns ................................................................................................................................ 12 Numerator and Denominator Data ............................................................................................................ 13 Data Analyses ............................................................................................................................................. 15 Table 1: PedVAE Measures Available in NHSN ........................................................................................... 16 References .................................................................................................................................................. 17 Appendix. List of Eligible Antimicrobial Agents .......................................................................................... 18 Introduction Mechanical ventilation is an essential, life -saving therapy for patients with critical illness and re spiratory failure. Hundreds of thousands of patients receive mechanical ventilation in the United States each year [1-3]. These patients are at high risk for complications and poo r outcomes, including death [1 -5]. Ventilator -associated pneumonia (VAP), sepsis, a cute respiratory distress syndrome (AR DS), pulmonary embolism, barotrauma, and pulmonary edema a re among the complications that can occur in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Such complications can lead to longer duration of mechanical ventilation, longer stays in the intensive care unit ( ICU) and hospital, increased healthcare costs, and increased risk of disability and death. In preterm neonates, prolonged mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome can contribute to the devel opment of chronic lung disease [6]. Prolonged mechanical ventilation in extremely low birthweight infants is also associated with neurodevelopmental delay [7]. Surveillance for ventilator -associated events in the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) prior to 2013 was limited to VAP. Traditional VAP definitions , including the NHSN PNEU definitions (revised in 2002), have well-described limitations [8 -11]. These definitions typically require radiographic evidence of pneumonia , although data suggest that chest radiograph findings do not accurately identify VAP. The subjectivity and variability inherent in chest radiograph technique, interpretation, and reporting make chest imaging ill -suited for inclusion in a definition algorithm to be used for the potential purposes of public reporting, inter -faci lity comparisons, and pay-for-reporting and pay -for-performance programs. Another major limitation of the available VAP definitions is their reliance on specific clinical signs or symptoms, which are subjective and may be poorly or inconsistently doc umented in the medical record. January 2023 Device -associated Module PedVAE 11-2 The limitations of VAP surveillance definitions have implications for prevention . Valid and reliable surveillance data are necessary for assessing the effectiveness of prevention strategies. It is notable that some effective mea sures for improving outcomes of patients on mechanical ventilation do not specifically target pneumonia prev ention [ 12-15]. In 2011, CDC organized a working group composed of members of several stakeholder organizations to address the limitations of the NHSN PNEU definitions and propose a new approach to surveillance for Ventilator -Associated Events (VAE) for NHSN , focusing on adult patients [16]. The organizations represented in the w orking group include d the Critical Care Societies Collaborative (the American Association of Critical -Care Nurses, the American College of Chest Physicians, the American Thoracic Society, and the Society for Critical Care Medicine ), the American Association for Respiratory Car e, the Association of Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology , the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists , the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee's Surveillance Working Group , the Infecti ous Diseases Society of America , and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. The VAE surveillance definition algorithm developed by the working group was implemented in the NHSN in January 2013 and is available for use in adult locations only. The definition algorithm is based on objective, streamlined, and potentially automatable criteria that identify a broad range of conditions and complications occurring in mechanical ly ventilated patients in adult locations . Data indicate that streamlined, objective algorithms to detect ventilator -asso ciated events are easily implemented, can make use of electronic health record systems to automate event detection, and identify events that are clinica lly important and associated with outcomes such as ICU and hospital leng th of stay and mortality [17, 18]. Research suggests that most VAEs in adult patients are due to pneumonia, ARDS, atelectasis, and pulmonary edema [17]. These are significant clinical cond itions that may be preventable. VAE rates and event characteristics in adult inpatient locations reporting data t o NHSN in 2014 have been published [19]. VAE surveillance was not initially made available for use in neonatal and pediatric locations, based o n the recommendations of a separate working group that CDC organized in 2012 to consider whether the VAE surveillance approach could also be used in neonatal and pediatric inpatient populations. This working group included representatives from the followin g organizations: the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on the Fetus and Newborn , the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases , the AAP Section on Critical Care , the AAP Section on Pediatric Pulmonology , the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses, the American College of Chest Physicians Pediatric Chest Medicine Network , the American Thoracic Society Scientific Assembly on Pediatrics , the American Association for Respiratory Care , the Children's Hospital Association, the Association of Profess ionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology , the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists , the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Society , the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America , the Society of Critical Care Medicine , and the Vermont -Oxford Network. In mid -2013, this working group determined that there were insufficient data to inform development of a pediatric VAE definition. Further working group discussions were postponed until 2015, following publication of the results of a study on pediatric VAE definition criteria [2 0]. This study demonstrated that events defined by changes in the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) and mean airway pressure (MAP) were associated with increases in patient length of stay as well as mortality [20]. After additional discussion with the working group, CDC decided to move forward with pediatric VAE (PedVAE) development and implementation in NHSN. January PedVAE 11-3 NOTE: The AE definition algorithm is for use in surveillance . It is not a clinical definition algorithm and is not intended for use in the clinical management of patients. Examples provided throughout this protocol are for illustration purposes only and are not intended to represent actual clinical scenar ios. Settings Inpatient locations eligible to participate in PedVAE surveillance are those neonatal and pediatric locations in acute care hospitals, long term acute care hospitals, and inpatient rehabilitation facilities where denominator data (ventilator and patient days) can be collected for patients . Such locations may include critical/intensive care units (ICU), specialty care areas (SCA), step -down units , and wards . A complete listing of neonatal and pediatric inpatient locations can be found in Chapter 15 CDC Locations and Descript ions. Non -acute care mapped locations in acute care facilities (chronic care units in acute care facilities) are not eligible to participate in Ped VAE surveillance. It is not r equired to monitor for PedVAE s after discharge if a patient is transferred to another facility while still on mechanical ventilation. However, if discovered, any Ped VAE with a date of event on the day of discharge or the day after discharge is attributed to the discharging location and should be included in any PedVAE reported to NHSN by the discharging location. No additional ventilator days are reported. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Patients INCLUDED in PedVAE surveillance: All patients in the neonatal and pediatric inpatient locations found in Chapter 15 , regardless of patient's age Patients on high -frequency oscillatory or jet ventilation Patients who are receiving a conventional mode of mechanical ventilation (for example, synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation) or high frequency oscillatory or jet ventilation o while in the prone position o while rece iving surfactant, corticosteroids, nitric oxide therapy, Patients EXCLUDED from PedVAE surveillance: All patie nts in the adult inpatient locations found in Chapter 15, regardless of patient's age Patients on extracorporeal life support or paracorporeal membrane oxygenation are excluded from PedVAE surveillance during periods of time when the support is in place th e entire calendar day January 2023 Device -associated Module PedVAE 11-4 Definitions PedVAE : PedVAEs are identified by deterioration in respiratory status after a period of stability or improvement on the ventilator (Figure 1). Patients must be mechanically ventilated for at least 4 calendar days to fulfill PedVAE criteria (where the day of intubation and initiation of mechanical ventilation is day 1) . Ventilator : Any device used to support, assist , or control respiration (inclusive of the weaning period) through the application of positive pressure to the airway when delivered via an artificial airway, specifically an oral/nasal endotracheal or tracheostomy tube. Ventilation and lung expansion devic es that deliver positive pressure to the airway (for example , CPAP, BiPAP, Bi-level, IPPB , (for example , nasal prongs, nasal mask, full face mask, total mask, etc.) are not considered ventilators unless positive pressure is delivered via an artificial airway (oral/nasal endotracheal or tracheostomy tube). Mean Airway Pressure (MAP) : The average pressure exerted on the airway and lungs from the beginning of inspiration until the beginning of the next inspiration [21]. In pat ients on mechanical ventilation, MAP is the most powerful influence on oxygenation and is determined by positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), inspiratory time, and frequency [22]. A sustained increase in the daily minimu m MAP of 4 cmH 2O following a period of stability or improvement on the ventilator is one of two criteria that can be used in meeting the PedVAE definition. Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FiO 2): The fraction of oxygen in inspired gas. For example, the FiO 2 of ambient air is 0.21; the oxygen concentration of ambient air is 21%. In patients on mechanical ventilation, the FiO 2 is one of the key parameters that can be adjusted depending on the patient's oxygenation needs and is typically in the range of 0.21 (oxygen concentration of 21%) to 1.0 (oxygen concentration of 100%). A sustained increase in the daily minimum FiO 2 of 0.2 5 (25 points ) following a period of stability or improvement on the ventilator is one of the two criteria that can be used in meeting the PedVAE definition. Daily Minimum MAP : The lowest value of MAP during a calendar day. For the purposes of surveillance: When determining the daily minimum MAP value, round MAP readings in the following manner: a MAP of 10.00 - 10.49 is rounded to 10 and a MAP of 10.50 - 10.99 is rounded to 11. For example, a patient who is intubated and started on mechanical ventilation at 9:30 pm on June 1, with a MAP of 10.35 cmH 2O at 9:30 pm and a MAP of 10.54 cmH 2O at 11:30 pm would have a daily minimum MAP of 10 cmH 2O on June 1. In patients < 30 days old, MAP values of 0 -8 cmH 2O are considered equivalent; therefore, any day on which the daily min imum MAP was 0 -8 cmH 2O would be assigned a daily minimum value of 8 cmH 2O. In patients 30 days old, MAP values of 0 -10 cmH 2O are considered equivalent; therefore, any day on which the daily minimum MAP was 0 -10 cmH 2O would be assigned a daily minimum val ue of 10 cmH 2O. January 2023 Device -associated Module PedVAE 11-5 EXAMPLE: The patient (< 30 days old) is intubated at 6 pm. MAP values through the remainder of the calendar day are as follows: Time 6 pm 7 pm 8 pm 9 pm 10 pm 11 pm MAP (cmH 2O) 12.35 11.15 9.28 9.43 11.42 11.35 In this example, the daily minimum MAP for the purposes of PedVAE surveillance is 9 cmH 2O. MAP readings of 9.28 and 9.43 are rounded to 9. EXAMPLE: The patient is intubated at 6 pm. MAP values are as follows through the remainder of the calendar day: Time 6 pm 7 pm 8 pm 9 pm 10 pm 11 pm MAP (cmH 2O) 12 12 10 12 10 12 In this example, the daily minimum MAP for the purposes of PedVAE surveillance is 10 cmH 2O. This is the lowest value recorded during the calendar day. When making daily minimum MAP determinations the value does not need to be maintained for > 1 hour. EXAMPLE: MAP values are as follows through the course of a calendar day for a patient 30 days old: Time 1 am 4 am 8 am 12 pm 4 pm 8 pm MAP (cmH 2O) 9 (10) 11 9 (10) 11 11 12 In this example, the daily minimum MAP is 10 cmH 2O. Although 9 cmH 2O is the lowest value recorded, in patients 30 days old MAP values of 0 -10 cmH 2O are considered equivalent; therefore, the daily minimum MAP of 9 cmH 2O at 1 am and 8 am would be assigned a daily minimum value of 10 cmH 2O. EXAMPLE: You are reviewing a < 30 -day -old patient's ventilator data on Wednesday morning to determine the daily minimum MAP values for Monday and Tuesday. The neonatal ICU (NICU) monitors and records MAP every 30 minutes . You see that the lowest MAP on Monday (9 cmH 2O) was recorded at 11:30 pm when the episode of mechanical ventilation was initiated for this patient. The patient remained at this MAP for an additional 30 minutes on Tuesday morning and was then at MAP 12 cm H2O for the rest of the day on Tuesday. What do you record as the daily minimum MAP for Monday and for Tuesday? The lowest (and only) value of 9 cmH 20 is recorded as the daily minimum MAP for Monday. On Tuesday, the daily minimum MAP should also be recorde d as 9 cmH 2O, as it is the lowest value recorded on Tuesday. Day Time MAP (cmH 2O) Monday 23:30 9 Tuesday 00:00 9 Tuesday 00:30 9 January 2023 Device -associated Module PedVAE 11-6 Day Time MAP (cmH 2O) Tuesday 01:00 12 Tuesday 01:30 12 Tuesday 02:00 through 23:30 12 Daily Minimum FiO 2: The lowest value of FiO 2 during a calendar day that is set on the ventilator and maintained for > 1 hour . This requirement that the daily minimum FiO 2 be the lowest setting maintained for > 1 hour will ensure that units monitoring and recording FiO 2 settin gs hourly or more frequently than once per hour are able to apply the PedVAE surveillance FiO 2 criterion in a standardized way. If ventilator settings are monitored and recorded less frequently than once per hour (for example, every 2 hours or every 4 hou rs), the daily minimum FiO 2 is simply the lowest value of FiO 2 set on the ventilator during the calendar day. EXAMPLE: FiO 2 is set at the following values through the course of a calendar day: Time 12 am 4 am 8 am 12 pm 4 pm 8 pm FiO 2 1.0 0.6 0.4 0.5 0.55 0.6 In this example, the daily minimum FiO 2 for the purposes of PedVAE surveillance is 0. 4. FiO 2 settings are being monitored and recorded every 4 hours. E ach setting has been maintained for > 1 hour ; therefore , the lowest recorded FiO 2 setting for the calendar day is the daily minimum FiO 2. If there is no documentation of value s maintained for > 1 hour ( for example, the lowest value of FiO 2 is set late in the calendar day, mechanical ventilation is discontinued earl y in the calendar day, FiO 2 settings are changed very frequently throughout the calendar day) , the dail y minimum FiO 2 will default to the lowest value of FiO 2 set on the ventilator dur ing the calendar day (regardless of how long that setting was maintained). For example, a patient who is intubated and started on mechanical ventilation at 11:30 pm on June 1, with a FiO 2 setting of 0.30 from 11:30 pm to midnight, would have a daily minimum FiO 2 of 0.30 on June 1 for the purposes of PedVAE surveillance. In units tracking FiO 2 settings every hour or more frequently than every hour, there must be sufficient consecutive rec ordings of a specific FiO 2 setting to meet the minimum required duration of > 1 hour. In units tracking FiO 2 every 15 minutes, 5 consecutive recordings of FiO 2 at a certain level would be needed to meet the required > 1 hour minimum duration (for example, 09:00, 09:15, 09:30, 09:45, and 10:00). In units tracking FiO 2 every 30 minutes, 3 consecutive recordings of FiO 2 at a certain level would be needed to meet t he required > 1 hour minimum duration (for example, 09:00, 09:30, and 10:00). In units tracking FiO 2 every hour, 2 consecutive recordings of FiO 2 at a certain level would be needed to meet the required > 1 hour minimum duration (for example, 09:00 and 10:0 0). EXAMPLE: The patient is intubated at 6 pm. FiO 2 is set at the following values through the remainder of the calendar day: January 2023 Device -associated Module PedVAE 11-7 Time 6 pm 7 pm 8 pm 9 pm 10 pm 11 pm FiO 2 1.0 0.8 0.5 0.5 0.8 0.8 In this example, the daily minimum FiO 2 for the purposes of PedVAE surveillance is 0.5. FiO 2 settings are being monitored and recorded every hour. There are two consecutive hours where the FiO 2 setting is noted to be 0.5 (8 pm and 9 pm), and therefore the required minimum duration of > 1 hour is met. EXAMPLE: The patient is intubated at 6 pm. FiO 2 is set at the following values through the remainder of the calendar day: Time 6 pm 7 pm 8 pm 9 pm 10 pm 11 pm FiO 2 0.8 0.8 0.5 0.8 0.5 0.8 In this example, the daily minimum FiO 2 for the purposes of PedVAE surveillance is 0.8. FiO 2 settings are being monitored and recorded every hour. Although the lowest FiO 2 is 0.5, it is recorded at two non -consecutive time points only (8 pm, and then 10 pm), and so the required > 1 hour minimum duration is not met. There are two consecutive hours where the FiO 2 setting is noted to be 0.8 (6 pm and 7 pm), and therefore the required minimum duration of > 1 hour is met to allow use of this setting as the daily minimum FiO 2 for PedVAE surveillance. EXAMPLE: You are reviewing a patient's ventilator settings on Friday morning to determine the daily minimum FiO 2 value for Thursday. The patient was intubated and initiated on mechanical ventilation at 21:45 hours o n Thursday. The pediatric ICU (PICU) monitored and recorded FiO 2 settings for the patient every 15 minutes during the remainder of the day on Thursday. Based on the information recorded in the table below, what should you record as the daily minimum FiO 2 for Thursday? In this example, since there is no setting that is maintained for > 1 hour during the calendar day, the daily minimum FiO 2 for Thursday is 0.70 (70%). This is the lowest value of FiO 2 set on the ventilator during the calendar day. Day Time FiO 2 Thursday Period: The baseline period of stability or improvement on the ventilator is defined as the 2 calendar days immediately preceding the first day of increased daily minimum MAP or FiO 2, and must be characterized by 2 calendar days of stable or decreasing daily min imum MAP or FiO 2 values ( specifically, the daily minimum MAP or FiO 2 on the second day of the baseline period of stability or improvement must January 2023 Device -associated Module PedVAE 11-8 be equal to or less than the daily minimum MAP or FiO 2 on the first day of the baseline period of stability or improvement ). Note that the daily minimum MAP is the lowest value docum ented during a calendar day, and the daily minimum FiO 2 is the lowest value documented during a calendar day that was maintained for > 1 hour (see daily minimum FiO 2 definition for exception to the > 1 hour requirement) . Period of Worsening Oxygenation: The period of worsening oxygenation is defined as an increase in the daily minimum FiO 2 of at least 0.25 (25 points) over the daily minimum FiO 2 of the first day in the baseline period or an increase in the daily minimum MAP values of at least 4 cmH 2O over the daily minimum MAP of the first day in the baseline period, that immediately follows the baseline period and is sustained for at least 2 or more calendar days. Figure 1: Pediatric Ventilator -Associated Events (PedVAE) Surveillance Algorithm EXAMPLE: In the example below , in a patient < 30 days old , the baseline period is mechanical v entilation (MV) da ys 1 through 4 (shaded in light gray), and the period of wo rsening oxygenation is MV days 5 and 6 (shaded in darker gray), where the daily minimum MAP is 4 cmH 2O greater than the daily minimum MAP during the baseline period (keeping in mind that daily minimum MAP values 0 -8 cmH 2O in a patient < 30 days should be considered to be equal to 8 cmH 2O for the Pediatric Ventilator -Associated Event (PedVAE) After a period of stability or improvement on the ventilator, the patient has at least one of the following indicators of worsening oxygenation: 1) Increase in daily minimum FiO 2 of 0.25 (25 points) over the daily minimum FiO 2 of the first day in the baseline period, sustained for 2 calendar days. 2) Increase in daily minimum MAP values of 4 cmH 2O over the daily minimum MAP of the first day in the baseline period, sustained for 2 calendar days . Patient has a baseline period of stability or improvement on the ventilator, defined by 2 calendar days of stable or decreasing daily minimum* FiO 2 or MAP values. The baseline period is defined as the 2 calendar days immediately preceding the first day of increased daily minimum FiO 2 or MAP. *Daily minimum FiO 2 is defined as the lowest value of FiO 2 documented during a calendar day that is maintained for > 1 hour. Daily minimum MAP is the lowest value documented during the calendar day. For patients < 30 days old, daily minimum MAP values 0 -8 cm H 2O are con sidered equal to 8 cmH 2O for the purposes of surveillance. For patients 30 days old, daily minimum MAP values 0 -10 cmH 2O are considered equal to 10 cmH 2O for the purposes of surveillance. January 2023 Device -associated Module PedVAE 11-9 purposes of surveillance, and an increase in the daily minimum MAP to at least 12 cmH 2O, sustained for at least 2 calendar days, would be needed to meet the PedVAE definition .) EXAMPLE: In the example below , the baseline period is mechanical ventilation ( MV) days 3 and 4 (shaded in light gray) , and the period of worsen ing oxygenation is MV days 5 and 6 (shaded in darker gray), where the daily minimum FiO 2 is 0.25 (25 points ) over the daily minimum FiO 2 during the baseline period. EXAMPLE: In the example below, there is no PedVAE because the FiO 2 on MV day 4 is higher than the FiO 2 on MV day 3 (and therefore not stable or decreasing) - even though the FiO 2 on MV days 5 and 6 meets the 2 5-point threshold when compared with the daily minimum FiO 2 on MV days 3 and 4. Date of Event : The da te of onset of worsening oxygenation . This is defined as the first calendar day in which the daily minimum MAP or FiO 2 increases above the thresholds outlined in the PedVAE definition algorithm ( specifically , day 1 of the required 2 -day period of worsening oxygenation following a 2 -day period of stability or improvement on the ventilator). The earliest date of event for PedVAE is day 3 of mechanical ventilation (where the day of intubation and initiation of mechanical ventilation is day 1). The \"date of event\" is NOT the date on which all PedVAE criteria have been met. It is the first day (of a 2 - day period) on which either of the worsening oxygenation thresholds (for MAP or FiO 2) is met. MV Day Daily minimum MAP (cmH 2O) Daily minimum FiO 2 (oxygen concentration, %) PedVAE 1 7 (8) 1.00 (100%) - 2 7 (8) 0.50 (50%) - 3 8 0.50 (50%) - 4 8 0.50 (50%) - 5 12 0.50 (50%) 6 12 0.50 (50%) - MV Day Daily minimum MAP (cmH 2O) Daily minimum FiO 2 (oxygen concentration, %) PedVAE 1 12 1.00 (100%) - 2 11 0.50 (50%) - 3 9 0.40 (40%) - 4 9 0.40 (40%) - 5 11 0.70 (70%) 6 11 0.70 (70%) - MV Day Daily minimum MAP (cmH 2O) Daily minimum FiO 2 (oxygen concentration, %) PedVAE 1 12 1.00 (100%) - 2 11 0.50 (50%) - 3 9 0.35 (35%) - 4 9 0.40 (40%) - 5 11 0.70 (70%) No event 6 11 0.70 (70%) - January 2023 Device -associated Module PedVAE 11-10 EXAMPLE : A patient is intubated in the Emergency Room for severe community-acquired pneumonia and admitted to the PICU (day 1). The patient stabilizes and improves on days 2 -5, with a daily minimum FiO 2 of 0.35 (35%) on days 4 and 5. On day 6, the patient experie nces respiratory deterioration, and requires a minimum FiO 2 of 0.60 (60%) on days 6 and 7, meeting the criteria for a PedVAE . The date of the PedVAE event is day 6. 14-day Event Period : PedVAEs are defined by a 14 -day period, starting on the day of onset of worsening oxygenation (the date of event , day 1). A new PedVAE cannot be identified or reported until this 14 -day period has elapsed. Episode of M echanical Ventilation: Defined as a period of days during which the patient was mechanically ventilated f or some portion of each c onsecutive day . A break in mechanical ventilation of at least one full calendar day, followed by re intubation and /or reinitiation of mechanical ventilation during the same hospitalization, defines a new episode of mechanical venti lation. EXAMPLE: A patient is intubated and mechanical ventilation is initia ted at 11 pm on hospital day 1. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated from hospital days 2 -10. The patient is extubated at 9 am on hospital day 11 and remai ns extubated on hospital day 12. The patient is reintubated and mechanical ventilation is reinitiated on hospital day 13. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated from hospital day 14 -18. This patient has had two episodes of mechanical ventilation (days 1 -11 and days 13-18) , separated by at least one full calendar day off of mechanical ventilation. Location of Attribution: The inpatient location where the patient was assigned on the PedVAE date of event , which is further defined as the date of onset of worsening oxygenation. EXAMPLE : Patient is intubated and ventilated in the Operating Room on hospital day 1, and then is admitted post -operatively to the N ICU on hospital day 1, still on the ventilator . On hospital day 3, the patient experiences the onset of worsening oxygenation, manifested by an increase in the daily minimum FiO 2 of 0.25 (25 points ). On day 4 (also the 4th day of mechanical ventilation) the patient meets criteria for a PedVAE . This is reported as a PedVAE for the NICU. EXCEPTION : Transfer Rule : If a PedVA E develops on the day o f transfer or the day following transfer from one inpatient location to another in the same facility or to a new faci lity (where the day of transfer is day 1), the event is attributed to the transferring location. This is called the Transfer Rule, and examples are shown below . EXAMPLE: Patient is extubated in the P ICU and transferred to the medical stepdown unit on hospital day 6. The next day, while in the stepdown unit (day 7), the patient experiences worsening oxygenation and is reintubated and transferred back to the P ICU. Criteria for PedVAE are met the next day (day 8). In this case, the day prior to extubation and the day of extubation (hospital days 5 and 6) count as the required 2 -day period of stability or improvement. The day of reintubation (day 7 ) and the following day (day 8 ) count as the required 2 -day period of January 2023 Device -associated Module PedVAE 11-11 worsening oxygenation. Because the onset of worsening oxygenation occurred on the day following transfer out of the P ICU, the event is reported as a PedVAE for the PICU. EXAMPLE: Patient intubated and mechanically ventilated for 8 days in the NICU of Ho spital A is transferred for further care on day 8 to the N ICU of Hospital B. The patient was stable on the ventilator in Hospital A from days 3-8. On the day of transfer to Hospital B (day 1 in Hospital B ), the patient's respiratory status deteriorates. The day after transfer (day 2 in Hospital B), the patient meets criteria for PedVAE . The date of the event is day 1 in Hospital B, the first day of the period of worsening oxygenation meeting PedVAE MAP or FiO 2 thresholds . The infection preventionist (IP) from Hospital B calls the Hospital A IP to report that this patient was admitted to Hospital B with a PedVAE . This PedVAE should be reported by Hospital A and attributed to the Hospital A NICU . No additional ventilator days are reported by Hospital A . January 2023 Device -associated Module PedVAE 11-12 Reporting Instructions Conducting in -plan PedVAE surveillance means monitoring patients for the presence of events meeting the PedVAE definition. If the date of event (date of onset of worsening oxygenation) is on or after the date of documentation of evidence of consent AND the patient is being supported for organ donation purposes, the event should not be reported as a PedVAE. Secondary BSIs are not reported or attributable to a PedVAE . Clinical findings associated with a PedVAE may assist in better understanding the etiology and focusing efforts to prevent PedVAEs [23-25]. Should a facility choose to provide the following information, the PedVAE form includes optional data fields to report : o Clinical diagnoses or events that were associated with the PedVAE . Note that multiple events may be reported for a single PedVAE. o Antimicrobial agent s listed in the Appendix that are administered on the date of event or within the 2 days before or 2 days after the event . The name of the specific antimicrobial agent and the administration initiation date may also be reported. o Pathogens detected by culture or non -culture based microbiological testing of upper or lower respiratory specimens with a specimen collection date on the date of event or within the 2 days before or 2 days after the date of event or in blood with a specimen collection date within the 2 days before the date of event and up to 13 days after the date of event. NOTE : Because organisms belonging to the following genera are typically causes of community -associated respiratory infections and are rarely or are not known to b e causes of healthcare -associated infections, they are excluded, and cannot pneumoniae detected by urine antigen testing with a date of specimen collection on the date of event or within the 2 days before or 2 days after the event. January 2023 Device -associated Module PedVAE 11-13 Numerator and Denominator Data Numerator Data: The Pediatric Ventilator -Associated Event (PedVAE) form (CDC 57.113 ) is used to collect and report each Ped VAE that is identified during the month selected for surveillance. The Instructi ons for Completion of Pediatric Ventilator -Associated Event PedVAE Form includes brief instructions for collection and entry of each data element on the form. The Ped VAE form includes patient demographic information and informati on on the start date and location of initiation of mechanical ventilation . Additional data include the specific criteria met for identifying PedVAE , information about whether the patient was on antimicrobial drugs or had pathogens detected in culture or no n-culture based microbiological testing, whether the patient died, and , where applicable, the organisms detected and their antimicrobial susceptibilities. Reporting Instruction: If no PedVAEs are identified during the month of surveillance, the \" Report No Events \" box must be checked on the appropriate denominator summary screen, for example, Denominators for Intensive Care Unit (ICU)/Other Locations (Not NICU or SCA), etc. Denominator Data: Device days and patient days are used for denominators (see Chapter 16 General Key Terms ). Ventilator days, which are the number of patients managed with ventilatory device s, are collected daily, at the same time each day, according to the chosen location using the appropriate form (CDC 57.116 [NICU] or CDC 57.117 [Specialty Car e Areas] or CDC 57.118 [ICU/Other Locations ]). These daily counts are summed and only the total for the month is reported. Ventilator and patient days are collected for each of the locations monitored . All ventilator days are counted, including ventilator days for patients on mechanical ventilation for < 3 days, and ventilator days for patients on extracorporeal life support or paracorporeal membrane oxygenation who are excluded from PedVAE surveillance. Patients with tracheostomies who are undergoing weaning from mechanical ventilation using tracheostomy collar t rials are included in ventilator day counts if they are on mechanical ventilation at the time when the daily ventilator day count is performed. Patients who are not receiving mechanical ventilation via an artificial airway at the time of the daily ventilat or count are not included. When denominator data are available from electronic sources, these sources may be used as long as the counts are within +/- 5% of manually collected counts, validated for a minimum of 3 consecutive months. Validation of electronic counts should be performed separately for each location conducting PedVAE surveillance. When converting from one electronic counting system to another electronic counting system, the new electronic system should be validated against manual counts as abov e. If electronic counts for the new electronic system are not within 5% of manual counts, resume manual counting and continue working with IT staff to improve design of electronic denominator data extraction (while reporting manual counts) until concurrent counts are within 5% for 3 consecutive months. This guideline is important because validating a new electronic counting system against an existing electronic system can magnify errors and result in inaccurate denominator counts. Collection of an additiona l denominator, episodes of mechanical ventilation (EMV), is optionally available for PedVAE surveillance. The EMV denominator represents the sum of the number of episodes January 2023 Device -associated Module PedVAE 11-14 of mechanical ventilation that occurred in that location during the month. A single e pisode of mechanical ventilation for each patient is to be counted only once per month. Do note, it is possible for a patient to have more than one episode of ventilation occur during a month (for example, discontinuation of mechanical ventilation for grea ter than 1 calendar day followed by reinitiation of mechanical ventilation) . The EMV denominator is determined by counting all patients in the location who are on mechanical ventilation on the first day of the month regardless of eligibility for inclusion in PedVAE surveillance. Then, on each subsequent day of the month, count each additional patient that is started on mechanical ventilation. This would include those that are admitted to the location already on mechanical ventilation, those that are newly ventilated, and any prev iously ventilated patients who have new episodes of mechanical ventilation occurring during the same month. The sum of the count for the first day and each subsequent day of the month is reported. EXAMPLE: On January 1, there are 5 patients on mechanica l ventilation in the PICU (2 patients were started on mechanical ventilation on December 24, 2 patient s on December 31, and 1 patient on January 1). During the rest of the month, the following are noted: 1 patient is started on mechanical ventilation on Ja nuary 8; 2 patients are transferred to the P ICU on mechanical ventilation on January 15 ; and 1 patient who was previously ventilated (from January 1 through January 12) goes back on mechanical ventilation on January 20. No other patients are on mechanical ventilation during the month of January. The number of EMV for January is nine. This is calculated as follows: 5 patients (on mechanical ventilation on the first day of the month) + 4 patients who were either started on mechanical ventilation, transferred into the PICU on mechanical ventilation, or reinitiated on mechanical ventilation after being off of the vent for at least 1 calendar day = 9 EMV. January 2023 Device-associated Module PedVAE 11-15 Data Analyses All data that is entered into NHSN can be analyzed at event or summary level. The data in NHSN can be visualized and analyzed in various ways, specifically, descriptive analysis reports for both the denominator and numerator data. Types of PedVAE Analysis Reports PedVAE Rate The PedVAE rate per 1000 ventilator days is calculated by dividing the number of PedVAEs by the number of ventilator days and multiplying the result by 1000 (ventilator days) . P edVAE Rate per 1000 ventilator days = . . * 1000 The PedVAE rate per 100 episodes of mechanical ventilation (EMV) is calculated by dividing the number of PedV AEs by the number of episodes of mechanical ventilation and multiplying the r esult by 100 (episodes of mechanical ventilation) .

There is concern about these multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) , as options for treating patients with these infections are often extremely limited, and MDRO infections are associated with increased lengths of stay, costs, and mortality. Many of these traits have also been observed for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) has approved guidelines for the control of MDROs. 1 These guidelines are available at https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/MDRO/index.html ). The MDRO and C. difficile module of NHSN provide s a tool to assist facilities in meeting some of the criteria outlined in the guidelines. In addition, many of the metrics used in this module are consistent with \"Recommendations for Metrics for Multidrug -Resistant Organisms Position Paper.\"2 Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) is responsible for a spectrum of C. difficile infections (CDI), including uncomplicated diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, and toxic megacolon , which can, in some instances, lead to sepsis and death. Although CDI represents a subset of gastrointestin al tract infection s in the current CDC definitions for HAIs, specific standard definitions for CDI 3 should be incorporated to obtain a more complete understanding of how C. difficile is being transmitted in a healthcare facility. As outlined in the HICPAC guideline1, these MDRO and C. difficile pathogens may require specialized monitoring to evaluate if intensified infection control efforts are required to reduce the occurrence of these organisms and related infections. The goal of this module is to provide a mechanism for facilities to report and analyze data that will inform infection prevention professionals of the impact of targeted prevention efforts. This module contains two core reporting options for MDRO and C . difficile - Laboratory Identified (LabID) Event reporting and Infection Surveillance reporting. These reporting options function as two separate and independent reporting methods - one focused on laboratory -based reporting and the second on infection criteria-based surveillance reporting. Reporting options are summarized in Table 1 . Participants may choose either one or both of these reporting options and then may also choose to participate in any of the supplemental monitoring methods described in Table 1 . See Appendix 3: Differentiating Between LabID Event and Infection Surveillance for key differences between the two options. January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-3 Table 1.

If conducting facility -wide monitoring (Method C) , the denominator counts (admissions, patient-days and encounters) for these locations must be removed. January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-4 Reporting Method (must choose to monitor by LabID Event or Infection Surveillance reporting before supplemental methods can also be used for monitoring): A: Facility- wide by location. Report for each location separately and cover all locations in a facility. This reporting method requires the most effort but provides the most detail for local and national statistical data. B: Selected locations within the facility (1 or more). Report separately for one or more specific locations within a facility. This includes reporting individual events and denominator data for each of the selected locations. This reporting method is ideal for use in targeted prevention programs. Note: M DRO \" Blood S pecimens Only \" monitoring is the only MDRO LabID event reporting option for IRF, ED , and 24 -hr Observation locations. For Inpatient locations other than IRF, ED , and 24 -hr Observation (examples: IPF, Medical, Surgical, etc.) \" All Specimens\" monitoring is the only MDRO LabID event reporting option. C: O verall facility-wide . Report individual LabID events from each inpatient location and total denominator counts for the entire facility. Options include: (1) Overall Facility -wide Inpatient (FacWideIN) to cover all inpatient locations where denominator data are collected. When using FacWideIN reporting, facilities must also include location specific reporting for outpatient emergency department (adult and pediatric) and 24 -hr Observation location(s). Note : When following FacWideIN, facilities must include denominators for all inpatient locations physically located in the hospital Totals reported should not include facilities affiliated with the hospital that are enrolled separately in NHSN. Additionally, separate denominator data will be required to capture encounters for each mapped emergency department and 24 -hr observation location. (2) Overall Facili ty-wide Outpatient (FacWideOUT) to cover all outpatient locations affiliated with the facility where encounters are captured. Facilities may choose to monitor FacWideOUT in addition to FacWideIN monitoring. D: Overall facility-wide : Blood Specimens Only. This method is available for MDRO LabID Events only and targets the most invasive events. Report individual LabID events from each inpatient location and total denominator counts for the entire facility. Options include: (1) Overall Facility -wide Inpatient (Fa cWideIN) to cover all inpatient locations. Using this option, facilities must also include location specific reporting for each outpatient emergency department (specifically, adult and pediatric) and 24 -hr observation location(s). Note : When following FacWideIN, facilities must enter denominators for all inpatient locations physically located in the hospital, as well as denominators for all inpatient locations minus any inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) and inpatient psychiatric facility (IPF) locations with separate January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-5 CCNs. Totals reported should not include facilities affiliated with the hospital that are enrolled separately in NHSN. Additionally, separate denominator data will be required to capture encounters for each mapped emergency department and 24-hr observation location. (2) Overall Facility -wide Outpatient (FacWideOUT) to cover all outpatient locations affiliated with the facility. Facilities may choose to monitor FacWideOUT in addition to FacWideIN monitoring. Section I: Core Reporting Laboratory -Identified (LabID) Event Reporting Introduction: LabID Event reporting option allows laboratory testing data to be used without clinical evaluation of the patient, and therefore is a much less labor -intensive method to track MDROs and C. difficile . These provide proxy infection measures of MDRO and/or C. difficile healthcare acquisition, exposure burden, and infection burden based almost exclusively on laboratory data and limited admission date data, including patient care location. LabID Event reporting is ONLY for collecting and tracking positive laboratory results (for example, positive cultures) that are collected for \"clinical\" purposes (specifically for diagnosis and treatment). This means that t he results of laboratory specimens collected for active surveillance testing (AST) purposes only should not be reported as LabID Events. Key points for LabID Event Reporting: LabID Events can be monitored at the overall facility -wide level for inpatient areas (FacWideIN), and/or at the overall facility-wide level for outpatient areas (FacWideOUT). At the Overall facility -wide levels and for IRF, ED, and 24 -hour observation, MDROs can be monitored for All Specimen types or for Blood Specimens Only . All other inpatient and outpatient locations can only monitor for All Specimen types. LabID Events can be monitored for specific locations and require unique denominator data from each of the specific locations (specifically, facility-wide locations monit ored separately [Method A] allowing for both facility -wide and location -specific data, or by selected locations only [Method B]). A facility choosing to conduct FacWideIN surveillance for LabID Events must also follow location- specific surveillance for that same organism in each outpatient emergency department (pediatric and adult) and 24 -hour observation location (s). For NHSN reporting purposes, the 'date admitted to the facility' is hospital day (HD) 1. When determining a patient's admission dates to both the facility and specific inpatient location, the NHSN user must take into account any days spent in an inpatient location , as these days contribute to exposure risk. NHSN defines an inpatient as any patient cared for/housed on an inpatient location. Local status may differ from NHSN definition; all days spent in an inpatient unit, regardless of local admission status and/or billing status are included in the counts of admissions and in patient days for January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-6 the facility and specific location; for NHSN repo rting purposes, the date admitted to the facility is the calendar date that the patient physically locates to an inpatient location . For further information on counting patient days and admissions, see Appendix 2: Determining Pat ient Days for Summary Data Collection: Observation vs. Inpatients. Laboratory and admission data can be used to calculate a variety of distinct proxy measures including: admission prevalence rate and overall patient prevalence rate (measures of exposure burden), MDRO bloodstream infection incidence rate (measure of infection burden and healthcare acquisition), overall MDRO infection/colonization incidence rate (measure of healthcare acquisition) , and CD incidence rate (measure of infection burden and healthcare acquisition). Use NHSN forms to collect all required data, using the definitions of each data field as indicated in the Tables of Instructions . When denominator data are av ailable from electronic databases, these sources may be used only after a validation of a minimum 3 consecutive months proves the data to be within 5% (+/-) of the ma nually conducted once a day counts. 1A: MDRO LabID Event Reporting Methodology: Facilitie s may choose to monitor one or more of the following MDROs: MRSA, MRSA and MSSA, multidrug- resistant Acinetobacter spp. (see definitions below). For S. aureus , both the resistant (MRSA) and the susceptible (MSSA) phenoty pes can be tracked to provide concurrent measures of the susceptible pathogens as a comparison to those of the resistant pathogens in a setting of active MRSA prevention efforts. Note: No Active Surveillance Culture/Testing (ASC/AST) results are to be included in this reporting of individual results (See General Key Terms chapter ). AST tracking should be recorded under Process & Outcome Measures. MDRO Definitions: MDROs included in this module are defined below. MRSA: Includes S. aureus cultured from any specimen that tests oxacillin -resistant, cefoxitin - resistant, or methicillin-resistant by standard susceptibility testing methods, or any laboratory finding of MRSA (includes but not limited to PCR or other molecular based detection methods). MSSA: S. aureus cultured from a specimen testing susceptible to oxacillin, cefoxitin, or methicillin by standard susceptibility Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, or Enterococcus species unspecified (only those not identified to the species level) that is resistant to vancomycin, by standard susceptibility testing methods or a laboratory finding of VRE (includes but not limited to PCR or other molecular based detection methods). January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module by standard susceptibility methods ( specifically, minimum inhibitory concentrations of 4 mcg/mL imipenem/relebactam or KPC, NDM, VIM, polymerase chain reaction, metallo- -lactamase test, modified-Hodge test, Carba-NP). Note : For in- plan CRE surveillance, facilities must conduct surveillance for all three organisms CRE- -susceptible (specifically , either resistant or intermediate) to at least one agent in at least 3 antimicrobial classes of the following 6 antimicrobial in any location: inpatient or outpatient. Requirements: Facilities must choose at least one of the reporting methods listed below and report data . Note : Facilities must indicate each reporting choice chosen for the calendar month on the Patient Safety Monthly Reporting Plan (CDC 57.106 ). January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-8 For each MDRO being monitored, all MDRO test results are evaluated using either the algorithm in Figure 1 (All Specimens ) or Figure 2 (Blood S pecimens only ) to determine reportable LabID events for each calendar month and for each facility location as determined by the reporting method chosen. If monitoring All S pecimens , all first MDRO isolates (chronologically) per patient, per month, per location are reported as a LabID event regardless of specimen source [ EXCLUDES tests related to active surveillance testing ] (Figure 1); if a duplicate MDRO isolate is from blood, or if monitoring Blood Specimens only, it is reported as a LabID event only if it represents a unique blood source [specifically, no prior isolation of the MDRO in blood from the same patient and location in less than o r equal to 14 days , even across calendar months ] (Figures 1 & 2). As a general rule, at a maximum, there should be no more than 3 blood isolates reported, which would be very rare. If monitoring All S pecimens and a blood isolate is entered as the first specimen of the month, then no non-blood specimens can be entered that month for that patient and location. Report each LabID Event individually. January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-9 Figure 1 .

Note : Excludes tests related to active surveillance testing. Duplicate MDRO Isolate : If monitoring All Specimens , any subsequent MDRO isolate from the same patient and location after the first isolate of the specific MDRO during a calendar month, regardless of specimen source, except unique blood source (Figure 1). For blood isolates: Any MDRO blood isolate from the same patient and location, following a previous MDRO blood isolate within 14 days across calendar months & readmission to the same location. There should be 14 days with no blood isolates for the patient and specific location before another blood event is entered into NHSN for the patient and location. The date of specimen collection is considered Day 1. EXAMPLE: On January 2, a newly admitted ICU patient has a positive MRSA urine culture. The following week, while still in the ICU, the same patient has MRSA cultured from an infected decubitus ulcer. The MRSA wound culture is considered a duplicate MDRO isolate, since it is the second non -blood MRSA isolate collected from the same patient and location during the same calendar month. Unique Blood Source : A MDRO isolate from blood in a patient with no prior positive blood culture for the same MDRO and location in less than or equal to 14 days , even across calendar months and different facility admissions (Figure 2 ). There should be 14 days with no positive blood culture result for the patient, MDRO, and location before another Blood LabID Event is entered into NHSN for the patient, MDRO, and location for Blood Specimen only monitoring. All unique blood source isolates must be reported to NHSN (if your facility chooses this type of surveillance); however, not all unique blood source isolates will be counted in the FacWideIN Standardized Infection Ratio ( SIR) and analysis reports. More information about which events are counted in the numerator of the FacWideIN SIR can be found here: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/ps -analysis-resources/mrsacdi_tips.pdf . Additionally, if following All S pecimens , the first MDRO for the patient, month, and location should be reported. The date of specimen collection is considered Day 1. Note: NHSN recommends that facilities keep an internal line listing log of all positive isolates for reference in LabID event reporting which will assist i n decision making around the 14 -day reporting rule which is location specific. January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-13 EXAMPLE: Monitoring Blood Specimens only with multiple isolates from same location On January 1, an ICU patient has a positive MRSA urine culture which is not entered into NHSN because blood specimens only are being monitored. On January 2, while in the same location (ICU), the same patient has a positive MRSA blood culture which is entered into NHSN. This starts the 14 -day count. On January 5, while in the same locat ion (ICU), the same patient has another positive MRSA blood culture which is not entered into NHSN because it has not been 14 days since the original positive MRSA blood culture while in the same location. The January 5 positive blood culture starts a new 14-day count. On January 19, while in the same location (ICU), the same patient has another positive MRSA blood culture. The January 19 MRSA blood culture is entered into NHSN because it has been more than 14 days since the patient's most recent positive blood culture (January 5) while in the same location (January 19 is day 15). EXAMPLE: Monitoring All Specimens with multiple isolates from same location On January 1, an ICU patient has positive MRSA urine culture which is entered into NHSN because it is the first MDRO isolate of the month for this patient. On January 2, while in the same location (ICU), the same patient has a positive MRSA blood culture w hich is entered into NHSN because it is the first positive MRSA blood isolate for the month. No other non- blood MRSA isolates should be reported for the month for this patient and location as these would represent duplicate isolates. Any additional MRSA po sitive blood isolates for the month should be reported following the same 14 -day rule as when reporting Blood Specimens only. Subsequent months should be reported in the same manner. January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-14 Laboratory-Identified (LabID) Event : All non-duplicate MDRO isolates from any specimen source and unique blood source MDRO isolates . [EXCLUDES tests related to active surveillance testing]. Even if reporting at the Fac ility Wide level (FacWideIN or FacWideOUT) , all reporting must follow rule s by location for reporting. Note: A LabID Event calculator is available on the NHSN website to help with data entry decision making around the 14 -day rule, which is location specific . EXAMPLE #1: Monitoring Blood Specimens only with isolates from ED & inpatient location If monitoring blood specimens for FacWideIN (which requires surveillance in the emergency department and 24 -hour observation locations), a patient has a positive MRSA laboratory isolate while in the emergency department (ED). This specimen represents a MRSA LabID Event and should be entered for the outpatient emergency department. The next calendar day, the same patient is admitted to ICU and three days later, has a sec ond positive MRSA blood specimen. This specimen also represents a unique LabID Event, because it is the first positive blood specimen in this location (ICU). Note : while this patient has two LabID Events, the second specimen taken from the ICU will be removed from most analysis reports. EXAMPLE #2: Monitoring All Specimens If monitoring all specimens , on January 2, a newly admitted ICU patient with no previous positive laboratory isolates during this admission has a positive MRSA urine culture. This specimen represents a LabID Event since it is the first MRSA isolate for the patient, the location, and the calendar month. EXAMPLE #3: Monitoring All Specimens with isolates from ED & inpatient location If monitoring all specimens for FacWideIN surveillance, on January 2, a VRE wound culture is collected from the facility's own ED. The patient is then admitted to 4W the next calendar day. The ED culture result must be entered as an outpatient LabID event for the ED location for Ja nuary 2, as the ED location is included in FacWideIN surveillance and reporting. EXAMPLE #4: Monitoring Blood Specimens only with multiple blood isolates If monitoring blood specimens only , on January 26, a newly admitted ICU patient with no previous positive laboratory isolates during this admission has a positive MRSA urine culture which is not entered as a LabID Event since blood specimens only are being monitored. The following day, while in the same location, the same patient has a positive MRSA b lood culture. This specimen represents a LabID Event since it is a unique blood source (the first MRSA blood isolate for the same patient and same location). While remaining in ICU, the same patient has another positive blood culture on February 5. This do es not represent a new LabID Event since it has not been more than14 days since the most recent MRSA positive blood isolate for this patient and location. January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-15 Reporting Instructions : All LabID Events must be reported by location LabID event reporting is separate and independent of events reported through MDRO Infection Surveillance reporting and/or HAIs reported through the Device -associated and/or Procedure - associated Modules For instructions on unique reporting scenarios, see Appendix 1. Guidance for Handling MDRO and CDI Module Infection Surveillance and LabID Event Reporting When Also Following Other NHSN Modules For additional reporting information, see Appendix 3. Differentiating Between LabID Event and Infection Surveillance Numerator Data: Data is reported using the Laboratory-identified MDRO or CDI Event form (CDC 57.128 ). Denominator Data: Patient days and admissions (for inpatient locations) , and encounters (for outpatient locations ) are reported using the MDRO and CDI Monthly Denominato r Form (CDC 57.127 ). Reporting FacWideIN Denominators : Line 1: Facilities will enter total patient days and total patient admissions to reflect all inpatient locatio ns physically located in the hospital. Line 2: The second line of denominator data entry should reflect all inpatient locations minus inpatient rehabilitation units (IRF units) and inpatient psychiatric units (IPF units) with a separate CCN. Line 3: The third line of denominator data entry should reflect all inpatient locations minus inpatient rehabilitation units (IRF units) and inpatient psychiatric units (IPF units) with a separate CCN, and minus baby -based locations (for example , NICU, well baby nursery, etc.). The totals should not include other facility types within the hospital that are enrolled and reporting separately ( for example, LTAC). See Table of Instruction s for completion instructions. Note: All days spent in an inpatient unit, regardless of a patient's local admission status and/or billing status, should be included in the denominator counts of patient days and admissions for FacWideIN and/or the specific location . For a cute care hospitals completing FacWideIN surveillance, additional guidance on denominator reporting is available here: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/cms/acutecare- mrsa -cdi-labiddenominator -reporting.pdf . https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/training/patient-safety -com ponent/cdiff.html . FacWideOUT, Emergency Departments, 24 hour observation units, and other outpatient units: monthly denominator data are reported as encounters. An encounter is defined as any patient visit to an outpatient location. Each patient counts once regardless of time spent in the location. January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-16 MDRO Data Analysis: All event and summary (denominator) data that are entered into NHSN can be analyzed. After a user generates analysis datasets in the ap plication, all data entered for the facility up until that time are made available in the analysis reports. The data in NHSN can be visualized and analyzed in various ways. For example, descriptive analysis reports for numerator (LabID Events) and denomina tor ( for example, patient days, admissions) data, such as line lists, frequency tables, and bar and pie charts are available. In addition, measures of MDRO incidence and prevalence are available in rate tables and SIR reports. SIRs are only available for FacWideIN surveillance of MRSA bacteremia Categorizing Events Based on data provided on the LabID Event form, each event will be categorized by NHSN. Refer to the \"Onset\" variable in the NHSN Line List. Onset is assigned based on the location of specimen collection, the date admitted to facility, and date specimen collected, as applicable. Community -Onset (CO) : LabID Event specimen collected in an outpatient location or an inpatient location on H ospital D ay 1 [day of admission], HD 2 or HD 3 . He althcare Facility -Onset (HO) : LabID Event specimen collected on or after Hospital Day 4 whe re HD 1 is day of admissio n. Thus, all HO LabID Events will have occurred more than 3 calendar days after admission. MDRO LabID Event Inpatient HD1 - HD3 Onset = COHD4 or greater Onset = HOOutpatient Onset = CO Hospital Day (HD) January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-17 Rate Tables Rate tables are available for each organism in the MDRO Module. Various prevalence and incidence rates can be calculated at the month -level or higher. Note: Incomplete records in NHSN will trigger an \"Alert\" on the facility's homepage. All records identif ied by an \"Alert\" will be excluded from the rate tables until the Alert is resolved. The following section describes the various rates calculated for MDRO LabID event surveillance. Note : FacWideIN MDRO rates utilize the FacWideIN denominators (patient days and admissions) reported on Line 2 of the FacWideIN denominator record, which excludes admissions and patient days from inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) and inpatient psychiatric facility (IPF) locations with unique CCNs. For NHSN reporting purposes, IRFs/IPFs located within a hospital is recognized as an inpatient location for the hospital ; therefore, admissions/discharges from those facilities to IRF/IPF and vice versa are considered 'transfers', specifically, the hospitalization is considered a 'continuous' stay for event reporting. Proxy Measures for Exposure Burden of MDROs - All specimens: Inpatient Reporting: Admission Prevalence Rate = Number of 1st LabID Events per patient per month identified less than or equal to 3 days after admission to the location (if monitoring by inpatient location), or the facility (if monitoring by overall facility -wide inpatient = FacWideIN) / Number of patient admissions to the location or facility x 100 Location Percent Admission Prevalence that is Community -Onset = Number of Admission Prevalent LabID Events to a location that are CO / Total number Admission Prevalent LabID Events x 100 Location Percent Admission Prevalence that is Healthcare Facility -Onset = Number of Admission Prevalent LabID Events to a location that are HO / Total number of Admission Prevalent LabID Events x 100 Overall Patient Prevalence Rate = Number of 1st LabID Events per patient per month rega rdless of time spent in location ( specifically, prevalent + incident, if monitoring by inpatient location), or facility ( specifically, CO + HO, if monitoring by overall facility -wide inpatient = FacWideIN) / Number of patient admissions to the location or facility x 100 Outpatient Reporting: Outpatient Prevalence Rate = Number of 1st LabID Events per patient per month for the location (if monitoring by outpatient location), or the facility (if monitoring by overall facility -wide outpatient = FacWideOUT) / Number of patient encounters for the location or facility x 100 Measures for MDRO Bloodstream Infection : Calculated when monitoring either all specimens or blood specimens only. Note: Except for certain locations (specifically, inpatient rehabilitation facilities , January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-18 emergency departmen ts, and 24 -hour observation locations), the blood specimens only option can only be used at the FacWideIN and FacWideOUT levels . Inpatient Reporting: MDRO Bloodstream Infection Admission Prevalence Rate = Number of all unique blood source LabID Events per patient per month identified less than or equal to 3 days after admission to the location (if monitoring by inpatient location), or facility (if monitoring by overall FacWideIN) / Number of patient admissions to the location or facility x 100 o N ote : For MRSA Bacteremia FacWideIN surveillance, this is the CO rate that is used in the risk adjustment calculations of the MRSA bacteremia SIR. The numerator exclud es any event in which the patient had a prior positive event in the previous 14 days. MDRO Bloodstream Infection Incidence Rate = Number of all unique blood source LabID Events per patient per month identified more than 3 days after admission to the location (if monitoring by inpatient location), or facility (if monitoring by overall facility-wide inpatient = FacWideIN) / Number of patient admissions to the location or facility x 100 MDRO Bloodstream Infection Incidence Density Rate = Number of all unique blood source LabID Events per patient per month identified more than 3 days after admission to the location (if monitoring by inpatient location), or facility (if monitoring by overall facility-wide inpatient = FacWideIN) / Number of p atient days for the location or facility x 1,000 MDRO Bloodstream Infection Overall Patient Prevalence Rate = Number of 1st Blood LabID Events per patient per month regardless of time spent in location ( specifically , prevalent + incident, if monitoring by inpatient location), or facility ( specifically, CO + HO, if monitoring by overall facility- wide inpatient = FacWideIN) / Nu mber of patient admissions to the location or facility x 100 MRSA Bloodstream Reporting for CMS -certified Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (IRFs) mapped as units within a MRSA Bacteremia Incidence Density Rate for of all incident blood source MRSA LabID events identified more than 3 days after location admission to an IRF unit and where the patient had no positive MRSA bacteremia LabID Events in the prior 14 days in any CMS -certified IRF unit / Total number of pat ient days for IRF unit(s) x 1,000 Outpatient Reporting: Combined MRSA Bloodstream Infection Outpatient Prevalence Rate for ED and 24 -hour Observation Locations = Number o f unique blood source MRSA LabID events identified in an ED or 24- hour observation location / Total patient encounters in ED and 24 -hour observation location(s) x 100 o N ote : For MRSA Bacteremia FacWideIN surveillance, this outpatient rate is used in the risk adjustment calculations of the MRSA bacteremia SIR. The numerator excludes any event in which the patient had a prior positive event in the previous 14 days in an ED or 24-hour observation location. January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-19 MDRO Bloodstream Infection Outpatient Prevalence Rate = Number of all unique blood source LabID Events per patient per month for the location (if monitoring by outpatient location), or the facility (if monitoring by overall facility -wide outpatient = FacWideOUT) / Number of patient encounters for the location or facility x 100 Measures for MDRO -CRE surveillance: The above inci dence and prevalence rates are calculated separately for each species of CRE (specifically, Klebsiella, E.coli, and Enterobacter) as well as for all species combined. The following additional metric is available for CRE LabID event reporting: Percent Pos itive for Carbapenemase : Number of CRE positive for carbapenemase / N umb er of CRE tested for carbapenemase x 100 Proxy Measures for MDRO Healthcare Acquisition : Overall MDRO Infection/Colonization Incidence Rate = Number of 1st LabID Events per patient per month among those with no documented prior evidence of previous infection or colonization with this specific organism type from a previously reported LabID Event, and identified more than 3 days after admission to the location (if monitoring by inpatient location), or facility (if monitoring by overall facility-wide inpatient = FacWideIN) / Number of patient admissions to the location or facility x 100 Overall MDRO Infection/Colonization Incidence Density Rate = Number of 1st LabID Events per patient per month among those with no documented prior evidence of previous infection or colonization with this specific organism type from a previously reported LabID Event, and identified more than 3 days after admission to the location (if monitoring by inpatient location), or facility (if monitoring by overall facility -wide inpatient = FacWideIN) / Number of patient days for the location or facility x 1,000 MRSA Bacteremia LabID Event SIR Reports SIRs are only available FacWideIN surveillance of MRSA bacteremia and C. difficile . Unit -specific SIRs are not available. The section below is specific to the MRSA SIR. Information about the C. difficile SIR is available on page 32 . The stan dardized infection ratio (SIR) is calculated by dividing the number of observed events by the number of predicted events. The number of predicted events is calculated using probabilities estimated from negative binomial models constructed from 2015 NHSN data, which represents the baseline population. P-values and 95% confidence intervals are calculated in NHSN using a mid -P Exact Test to provide a statistical comparison between the number of observed events and the number of predicted events. In the NHSN applicatio n, the number of predicted events is referred to as \"numPred\". The SIR will be calculated only if the number of predicted events (numPred) is greater than or equal to 1. This is to help enforce a minimum precision criterion. January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-20 Note: Incomplete records in NH SN will trigger an \"Alert\" on the facility's homepage. All records identified by an \"Alert\" will be excluded from the SIRs until the Alert is resolved. Separate MRSA SIR reports exist in NHSN for each facility type: For acute care hospitals (ACHs), critical access hospitals (CAHs), long -term acute care hospitals (LTACHs) , and PPS -exempt cancer hospitals (PCHs) : FacWideIN MRSA Bacteremia SIR = Number of all unique blood source MRSA LabID Events identified in a non -IRF/IPF inpatient location more than 3 days after admission to the facility (specifically, HO MRSA blood events with no prior MRSA blood event for that patient in the previous 14 days) / Number of predicted HO MRSA blood LabID Events o Notes : An HO MRSA bacteremia LabID event will not be counted in the SIR if the same patient had a prior positive MRSA bacteremia in the previous 14 days. This 14 -day de- duplication crosses calendar months. More information about which events are counted in the numerator of the FacWideIN SIR can be found h ere: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/ps -analysis-resources/mrsacdi_tips.pdf o The acute care hospital MRSA SIR is only calculated on the quarter -level or higher, due to the r equirements for risk adjustment*. o The MRSA SIR reports located in the CMS Reports folder for LTACHs will not contain any data beyond 2018 Q3. See page 34 of this protocol, and the June 2019 NHSN Newsletter, for more information. For free - standing inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs): FacWideIN MRSA Bacteremia SIR = Number of all unique blood source MRSA LabID Events identified in a non -IPF location in which specimen collection occurred greater than 3 days after admission t o the facility (specifically, HO MRSA blood events with no prior MRSA blood event for that patient in the previous 14 days) / Number of predicted HO MRSA blood LabID Events o Notes : An HO MRSA bacteremia LabID event will not be counted in the SIR if the same patient had a prior positive MRSA bacteremia in the previous 14 days. This 14 -day de- duplication crosses calendar months. More information about which events are counted in the numerator of the FacWideIN SIR can be found here: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/ps -analysis-resources/mrsacdi_tips.pdf o The MRSA SIR reports located in the CMS Reports folder for IRFs will not contain any data beyond 2018 Q3. See page 34 of this protocol, and the June 2019 NHSN Newsletter, for more information. For IRF units located within a hospital: MRSA Bacteremia SIR for IRF Units = Number of all unique blood source MRSA LabID Events identified more than 3 days after location admission to the IRF unit and where the patient had no positive MRSA bacteremia LabID Event in the prior 14 days in any CMS-certified IRF unit / Number of predicted MRSA blood LabID in the IRF unit(s) January 2023 MDRO & Module 12-21 o : A MRSA bacteremia LabID event from the IRF unit will not be counted in the SIR if the same patient had a prior positive MRSA bacteremia in the previous 14 days in an IRF unit. This 14 -day de- duplication crosses calendar months. Data from all IRF Units within the hospital are combined. More information about which events are counted in the numerator of the IRF Unit SIR can be found here: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/ps - analysis-resources/mrsacdi_tips.pdf o The MRSA SIR reports located in the CMS Reports folder for IRFs will not contain any data beyond 2018 Q3. See page 34 of this protocol, and the June 2019 NHSN Newsletter, for more information. The CMS IRFQR and LTCHQR Program s no longer requir es submission of data for MRSA b acteremia starting with 2018 Q4 data. However, IRFs and LTACHs may still be required to report MRSA ba cteremia data in response to a state or local reporting mandate or may choose to continue this surveillance voluntarily. The SIR reports located in the general MDRO/CDI - LabID Event analysis folder will contain all data reported, beyond 2018 Q3. *For more information on the SIR, its methodology, and the MRSA and/or CDI parameter estimates, NHSN Group Analysis: NHSN Group Users can perform the same analysis as facility level users in NHSN. A few helpful tools in NHSN for groups are listed in the resources below. These t ools are guides on how to start and join a Group; how to create a template to request data from facilities; how to determine the level of access granted by the facility following the previous steps, and how to analyze the facilities data.

C. dif ficile LabID events may be monitored from all available inpatient locations, emergency departments , and 24 -hour observation locations as well as all available affiliated outpatient locations where care is provided to patients post discharge or prior to adm ission ( for example, outpatient clinics and/or physician offices using the same patient identification system for the patient as the admitting facility). Settings: C. difficile LabID Event reporting can occur in any location: inpatient or outpatient. Surveillance will NOT be performed in NICU, SCN, babies in LDRP, well-baby nurseries, or well-baby clinics. If LDRP locations are being monitored, baby counts must be removed when c ompiling total facility counts . Requirements: All C. difficile test results are evaluated using the algorithm in Figure 3. Facilities must choose one or more of the reporting choices listed in Table 3 below and report data accordingly. January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-23 Figure 3.

OR A toxin -producing C. difficile organism detected by culture or other laboratory means performed on a n unformed stool sample (must conform to the container) . Note s: When using a multi -step testing algorithm for CDI on the same unformed stool specimen, the finding of the last test performed on the specimen that is documented in the patient medical record will determine if the CDI positive laboratory assay definition is met. Only when the final report has specific test times attached to each of the individua l testing methods (for example, antigen/toxin and PCR) can one make a valid determination of which test is performed first and which is performed last. If there are no specific test times/time stamps attached to each individual testing method on the final lab report, consider the tests as performed simultaneously and any positive finding is eligible for use . Examples of Multi-step Testing Interpretations (does not consider prior positives): Multi -step Testing Same Specimen Testing Step Testing Method Documented Findings Eligible LabID Event? Example A Test 1 @ 1p NAAT Negative Yes Test 2 @ 1p GDH Positive Test 3 @ 2p EIA Positive Example B Test 1 @ 1p NAAT Positive No Test 2 @ 1p GDH Positive Test 3 @ 2p EIA Negative Example C Test 1 @1p GDH Positive Yes Test 2 @1p EIA Negative Test 3 @2p NAAT Positive Example D Test 1 @ 1p GDH Positive No Test 2 @1p EIA Positive Test 3 @ 3p NAAT Negative Last test Last test Last test Last test January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-26 Duplicate C. difficile -positive test : Any C. difficile toxin -positive laboratory result from the same patient and location, following a previous C. difficile toxin -positive laboratory result within 14 days even across calendar months and readmissions to the same facility location. There should be 14 days with no C. difficile toxin -positive laboratory result for the patient and specific location before another C. difficile LabID Event is entered into NHSN for the patient and location. The date of specimen collection of a previously submitted C. difficile LabID Event is considered Day 1. Note : NHSN recommends each facility keep an internal line listing log of all positive specimens as a reference in LabID event reporting to ensure the 14-day rule is applied correctly. The 14 -day rule for LabID event reporting is specific to the location and resets each time a patient transfers to a new inpatient location. EXAMPLE : On January 1, an ICU patient has a C. difficile toxin -positive laboratory result which is entered into NHSN. On January 4, while in the same location (ICU), the same patient has another positive C. difficile toxin -positive laboratory result which is not entered into NHSN because it is a duplicate for t he patient and location ( has not been more than 14 days since the original C. difficile toxin -positive laboratory result while in the same location) . On January 16, while in the same location (ICU), the same patient has another C. difficile toxin -positive laboratory result . While it has been more than 14 days since the initial positive C. difficile toxin -positive laboratory result was entered into NHSN (January 1) for the same patient and same location , it has not been more than 14 days since the patient's most recent C. difficile toxin -positive laboratory result (January 4) while in the same location. Therefore, the C. difficile toxin -positive laboratory result for January 16 is not entered into NHSN. On January 31, the patient has another C. difficile toxin-positive laboratory result while in the same location (ICU). Since it has been more than 14 days since the patient's most recent C. difficile toxin -positive laboratory result (January 16) while in the same location, this event is entered into NHSN. Laboratory-Identified (LabID) Event : All non -duplicate C. difficile toxin -positive laboratory results . Even if reporting at the f acility-w ide level (FacWideIN or FacWideOUT) , all reporting must follow rules by location for reporting. Notes: A LabID Event calculator is available on the NHSN website to help with data entry decision making around the location specific 14-day rule. If a facility is participating in FacWideIN surveillance and reporting, the facility must also conduct separate location-specific surveillance in all outpatient emergency department and 24 -hour observation locations. This means LabID Events for the same organism and LabID Event type must be reported from these locations even if the patient is not subsequently admitted to an inpatient location during the same encounter. All emergency department and 24 -hour observation locations must be identified and mapped as outpatient locations within NHSN. For more information about mapping locations, see Chapter 15 in the NHSN manual. January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-27 Reporting Instructions: All C. difficile LabID Events must be reported by location and separately and independent ly of Events reported using the C. difficile Infection Surveillance reporting option and/or HAI reporting. Numerator: Data is reported using the Laboratory-Identified MDRO or CDI Event form (CDC 57.128). Denominator Data: Patient days and admissions (for inpatient locations), and encounters ( for outpatient locations ) are r eported using the MDRO and CDI Monthly Denominator Form (CDC 57.127). Reporting FacWideIN Denominators : Line 1: Facilities will enter total patient days and total patient admissions to reflect all inpatient locations physically located in the hospital. See Table of Instructions for completion instructions. Line 2: The second line of denominator data entry should reflect all inpatient locations minus inpatient rehabilitation units (IRF units) and inpatient psychiatric units (IPF units) with a separate CCN. See Table o f Instructions f or completion instructions. Line 3: The third line of denominator data entry should reflect all inpatient locations minus inpatient rehabilitation units (IRF units) and inpatient psychiatric units (IPF units) with a separate CCN minus baby - based locations (for example, NICU, well baby nursery, etc.). See Table of Instructions for completion instructions. Note: All days spent in an inpatient unit, regar dless of a patient's local admission status and/or billing status, should be included in the denominator counts of patient days and admissions for FacWideIN and/or the specific location. For acute care hospitals completing FacWideIN surveillance, additiona l guidance on denominator reporting is available here: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/cms/acutecare- mrsa -cdi-labiddenominator -reporting.pdf . here: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/training/patient-safety -component/cdiff.html Primary CDI Test Method: The response for the primary test type used to identify CDI should reflect the testing method used on the majority ( more than 50%) of stool specimens tested during the quarter. The primary t est type is reported on the FacWideIN and CMS -certified IRF unit denominator forms on the third month of each quarter (March, June, September, and December). See below for hypothetical scenarios on how to determine the accurate CDI test method to report to NHSN. Example 1: At Facility A, the laboratory used either NAAT or EIA when testing specimens for CDI during the quarter. The decision to use either NAAT or EIA for a particular specimen was made based on pre -determined criteria set by the facility. For all specimens tested during this quarter, the facility noted that NAAT was used in 75% of specimens tested. EIA was used in 25% of specimens tested. Regardless of testing selection criteria, the appropriate response for primary test type for this quarter is NAAT because NAAT was used for the majority of specimens. January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-28 Example 2 : At Facility B, the laboratory uses \" GDH plus EIA for toxin, followed by NAAT for discrepant results \" as the standard testing process for specimens during the quarter. In a single quarter, testing ended with GDH plus EIA in 55% of specimens tested. The remaining specimens (45%) had discrepant results between GDH and EIA, and thus were reflexed to NAAT. The appropriate response for the primary test type for this quarter is \" GDH antige n plus EIA for toxin\" since the majority of specimens were not tested by NAAT . FacWideOUT and ED/24 -hour Observation locations reporting: Denominator data is provided using encounters. An encounter is defined as a patient visit to an outpatient location for care . Each visit counts as one encounter. For NHSN reporting purposes, the 'date admitted to the facility' is HD 1. When determining a patient's admission dates to both the facility and specific inpatient location, the NHSN user must take into account any days spent in an inpatient location as these days contribute to exposure risk. NHSN defines an inpatient as any patient cared for/housed in an inpatient location. Local status may differ from NHSN definition; all days spent in an inpatient unit, regardless of local admission status and/or billing status are included in the counts of admissions and inpatient days for the facility and specific location. For NHSN reporting purposes, the date admitted to the facility is the calenda r date that the patient physically locates to an inpatient location . For further information on counting patient days and admissions, see Appendix 2: Determining Patie nt Days for Summary Data Collection: Observation vs. Inpatients C. Difficile (CDI) Data Analysis: All CDI event and summary (denominator) data that are entered into NHSN can be analyzed. After a user generates analysis datasets in the application, all data entered for their facility up until that time are made available in the analysis reports. The data in NHSN can be visualized and analyzed in various ways . For example, descriptive analys is reports for numerator ( CDI Events) and denominator (for example, patient days, admissions) data, such as line lists, frequency tables, and bar and pie charts are available. In addition, measures of CDI incidence and prevalence are available in rate tabl es and SIR reports. SIRs are only available for FacWideIN surveillance of MRSA bacteremia are not available . CDI Event Categorization Based on data provided on the CDI LabID Event form, each event will be categorized b y NHSN. Refer to the \"Onset\" variable in the NHSN Line List. Onset is assigned based on the location of specimen collection, the d ate admitted to facility, date of specimen collect ion, and previous discharge, as applicable. Community -Onset (CO) : LabID Event meeting one of the following criteria: o A) collected in an outpatient location in which the patient was not previously discharged from an inpatient location within the same facility less than or equal to 28 days prior to current date of specim en collection January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-29 o B) collected in an inpatient location on HD 1 [day of admission], HD 2 or HD 3. Community -Onset Healthcare Facility- Associated (CO -HCFA) : CO LabID Event collected from a n inpatient or an outpatient location from a patient who was discharged from the facility less than or equal to 28 days prior to current date of stool specimen collection. The previous discharge must have been from an inpatient location within the same facility (in other words, an outpatient visit does not qualify as \"admitte d\", and therefore is not used to set the timeline for CO -HCFA). Healthcare Facility -Onset (HO) : LabID Event collected from an inpatient location on or after HD 4 where HD 1 is day of admission . In addition to the onset categorization, C DI LabID Events are further categorized by NHSN as Incident or Recurrent. Refer to the 'cdiAssay' variable in the NH SN Line List. Incident CDI LabID Event : Any CDI LabID Event from a specimen obtained more than 56 days after the most recent CDI LabID Event (or with no previous CDI LabID Event documented) for that patient. Note: the date of first specimen collection is considered day 1. Recurrent CDI LabID Event : Any CDI LabID Event from a specimen obtained more than 14 days and less than or equal to 56 days after the most recent CDI LabID Event for that patient. Note: the date of first specimen collection is considered day 1. CdiAssay will be unassigned, or \"blank\", for any CDI LabID event that was collected less than or equal to 14 days after the most recent CDI LabID event for that patient. CDI LabID Event Prior discharge* = No Inpatient HD4 or greater Onset = HOHD1 -HD3 Onset = COOutpatient Onset = COPrior discharge* = Yes Outpatient or HD1 -HD3 Onset = CO-HCFAHD4 or greater Onset = HO * Patient discharged from inpatient location within the same facility less than or equal to 28 days prior current event Hospital Day (HD) January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-30 Note: CdiAssay is assigned based on prior events from a patient that occurred in an inpatient location, emergency department, or 24-hour observation location. Rate Tables FacWideIN and location-specific rate tables are available for CDI. Various prevalence and in cidence rates can be calculated at the month -level or higher. Note: Incomplete records in NHSN will trigger an \"Alert\" on the facility's homepage. All denominator records identified by an \"Alert\" will be excluded from the rate tables until the Alert is resolved. Note : FacWideIN CDI rates utilize the FacWideIN denominators (patient days and admissions) reported on Line 3 of the FacWideIN denominator record , which excludes admissions and patient days from the following: IRF and IPF locations with unique CC Ns separate from the reporting facility, neonatal ICUs, special care nurseries, and well-baby locations. For NHSN reporting purposes, IRFs/IPFs located within a hospital is recognized as an inpatient location for the facility ; therefore, admissions/dischar ges from hospitals to IRF/IPF and vice versa are considered 'transfers', specifically, the hospitalization is considered a 'continuous' stay for event reporting. The following section describes the various measures calculated for CDI LabID event surveillance. CDI Prevalence Rates : Inpatient Admission Prevalence Rate = Number of non -duplicate CDI LabID Events per patient per month identified less than or equal to 3 days after admission to the location (if monitoring by inpatient location), or facility (if monitoring by overall facility -wide inpatient=FacWideIN) (includes CO and CO-HCFA events) / Number of patient admissions to the location or facility x 100 o N ote : See \"CDIF_admPrevRate\" in the NHSN Rate Tables. Community -Onset Admission Prevalence Rate = Number of inpatient CDI LabID events that are CO, per month , in the facility / Number of patient admissions t o the facility x 100 o N ote : See \"CDI_COprevRate\" in the NHSN Rate Tables. This calculation is only accurate for overall FacWideIN report ing. For CDI FacWideIN surveillance, this is the CO rate that is used in the risk adjustment calculations of the CDI SIR. Inpatient Percent Admission Prevalence that is Community -Onset = Number of Admission Prevalent LabID Events to a location that are CO / Total number Admission Prevalent LabID Events x 100 o N ote : See \"CDIF_pctAdmPrevCO\" in the NHSN Rate Tables. This percentage is available for unit-specific CDI surveillance and is calculated separately for each applicable unit. The numerator in this formula does not include CDI LabID events labeled as CO-HCFA. Inpatient Percent Admission Prevalence that is Community -Onset Healthcare Facility-Associated = Number of Admission Prevalent L abID Events to a location that are CO -HCFA / Total number Admission Prevalent LabID Events x 10 o N ote : See \"CDIF_pctAdmPrevCOHCFA\". This percentage is available for unit-specific CDI surveillance and is calculated separately for each applicable unit. January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-31 Inpatient Percent Admission Prevalence that is Healthcare Facility -Onset = Number of Admission Prevalent LabID Events to a location that are HO / Total number of Admission Prevalent LabID Events x 100 o N ote : See \"CDIF_pctAdmPrevHO\" in the NHSN Rate Tables. Thi s percentage is available for unit-specific CDI surveillance and is calculated separately for each applicable unit. Inpatient Overall Patient Prevalence Rate = Number of 1st CDI LabID Events per patient per month regardless of time spent in location ( specifically , prevalent + incident, if monitoring by inpatient location), or facility ( specifically, CO + CO-HCFA + HO, if monitoring by FacWideIN) / Number of patient admissions to the location or facility x 100 o N ote : See \"CDIF_prevRate\" in the NHSN Rate Tables. Outpatient Prevalence Rate = Number of all non -duplicate CDI LabID Events per patient per month for the location (if monitoring by outpatient location), or the facility (if monitoring by overall facility -wide outpatient=FacWideOUT) / Number of pat ient encounters for the location or facility x 100 Combined Outpatient Prevalence Rate for ED and 24 -hour Observation Locations = Total n umber of unique CO CDI LabID events identified in an ED or 24 - hour observation location / Total patient encounters in ED and 24-hour observation location(s) x 100 o N ote : The numerator excludes any event in which the patient had a prior positive CDI event in the previous 14 days in an ED or 24 -hour observation location. Date of first specimen collection is considered \"Day 1\". CDI Incidence Rates Inpatient Location CDI Incidence Rate = Number of Incident CDI LabID Events per month identified more than 3 days after admission to the location / Number of patient days for the location x 10,000 o N ote : See \"CDIF_incRate\" in the NHSN Rate Tables. This rate is only available for location- specific CDI surveillance. Inpatient Facility CDI Healthcare Facility -Onset Incidence Rate = Number of all Incident HO CDI LabID Events per month in the facility / Number of patient days for the facility x 10,000 o N ote: See \"CDIF_HOIncRate\" in the NHSN Rate Tables. (T his calculation is only available for FacWideIN reporting.) Inpatient Facility CDI Combined Incidence Rate = Number of all Incident HO and CO-HCFA CDI LabID Events per month in the facility / Number of patient days for the facility x 10,000 o N ote : See \"CDIF_facIncRate\" in the NHSN Rate Tables. (This calculation is only available for FacWideIN reporting.) January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module Incidence Number of all incident CDI LabID events identified more than 3 days after location admission to an IRF unit and where the patient had no positive CDI LabID events in the prior 14 days in any CMS-certified IRF unit / Total number of patient days for IRF units x 10,000 o N ote : See \"CDIF_IRFIncRate\" in the NHSN Rate Tables. This rate is only available for CMS- certified IRF units located within an acute care , critical access , or long -term acute care hospital s CDI LabID Event SIR Reports SIRs are only available for FacWideIN surveillance of MRSA bacteremia and C. difficile . Unit -specific SIRs are not available. The section below is specific to the CDI SIR. For more information about the MRSA SIR, refer to page 19 . The standardized infection ratio (SIR) is calculated by dividing the number of observed events by the number of predicted events. The number of predicted events is calculated using probabilities estimated from negative binomial models constructed from 2015 NHSN data, which represents the baseline population. P-values and 95% confidence intervals are calculated in NHSN using a mid -P Exact Test to provide a statistical comparison between the number of observed events and the number of predicted events. In the NHSN application, the number of predicted events is referred to as \"numPred\". The SIR will be calculated only if the number of predicted events (numPred) is greater than or equal to 1. This is to help enforce a minimum precision criterion. Note: Incomplete records in NHSN will trigger an \"Alert\" on the facility's homepage. All records identified by an \"Alert\" will be excluded from the SIRs until the Alert is resolved. The CDI SIRs are only calculated at the quarter level or higher in order to account for the quarterly - reporting of CDI test type. Note that SIRs will not be calculated for a quarter until the CDI test type has been reported. The risk adjustment model for s ome facility types also utilizes a quarterly community- onset prevalence rate, which requires that all 3 months of data entry are complete in NHSN before an SIR is calculated. When the FacWideIN or IRF Unit MDRO denominator form is completed for the last mo nth of each quarter, users are asked to report the primary type of test that was used to identify CDI in the hospital for that quarter. That test type is then used in the calculation of the FacWideIN or IRF Unit CDI SIR for that quarter. The test type se lected should reflect the testing methodology used for clinical decision making. Separate CDI SIR reports exist in NHSN for each facility type: For acute care hospitals (ACHs), critical access hospitals (CAHs), long -term acute care hospitals (LTACHs) , and PPS -exempt cancer hospitals (PCHs) & CDI Module 12-33 all ncident CDI LabID Events identified in a non -IRF/IPF location more than 3 days after admission to the facility) / Number of predicted Incident HO CDI LabID Events o Note : More information about which events are counted in the FacWideIN CDI SIR can be found ncident CDI LabID Events identified in a non -IPF location more than 3 days after admission to the facility/ Number of predicted Incident HO CDI LabID Events o Note : More information about which events are counted in the FacWideIN CDI SIR can be found here: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/ps -analysis-resources/mrsacdi_tips.pdf For CMS -certified Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Units located within a hospital: IRF units within a hospital that participate in the CMS Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Quality Reporting Program will be given a CDI SIR separate from the FacWideIN SIR for the acute care hospital. The SIR will be sent to CMS on behalf of IRF units participating in the CMS IRF Quality Reporting Program. CDI SIR for IRF units: Number of all CDI LabID events identified more than 3 days after location admission to an IRF unit and where the patient had no positive CDI LabID events in the prior 14 days in any CMS -certified IRF unit / Number of predicted CDI LabID events in the IRF unit(s) o Note : This SIR is only available for CMS- certified IRF units located within a hospital. The CDI SIR for IRF Units is only calculated at the quarter level or higher in order to account for the quarterly-reporting of CDI test type. Note that SIRs will not be calculated for a quarter until the CDI test type has been reported. When the IRF Unit's MDRO denominator form is completed for the last month of each quarter, users are asked to report the primary type of test that was used to identify CDI for that quarter. That test type is then used in the calculation of the IRF Unit's CDI SIR for that quarter. More information about which events are counted in the IRF Unit's CDI SIR can be found here: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/ps -analysis-resources/mrsacdi_tips.pdf *For more information on the SIR, its methodology, and the MRSA and/or CDI parameter estimates, NHSN Group Analysis: NHSN Group Users can perform the same analysis as facility level users in NHSN. A few helpful tools in NHSN for groups are l isted in the resources below. These tools are guides on how to start and join a Group; how to create a template to request data from facilities; how to determine the level of access granted by the facility following the previous steps, and how to analyze t he facilities data.

Surveillance must occur from at least one patient care area and requires a ctive, patient-based, prospective surveillance of the chosen MDRO(s) and/or C. difficile infections (CDIs) by a trained Infection Preventionist (IP) . This means that the IP shall seek to confirm and classify infections caused by the chosen MDRO(s) and/or C. difficile for monitoring during a patient's stay in at least one patient care location during the surveillance period. These data will enhance the abi lity of NHSN to aggregate national data on MDROs and January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-36 2A. MDRO Infection Surveillance Reporting Methodology: Facilities may choose to monitor one or more of the following MDROs: MRSA, MRSA resistant Acinetobacter spp. (See definitions in Section I, Option 1 A). For S. aureus , both the resistant (MRSA) and the susceptible (MSSA) phenotypes can be tracked to provide concurrent measures of the susceptible pathogens as a comparison to those of the resistant pathogens in a setting of active MRSA prevention efforts . Note: No Active Surveillance Culture/Testing (ASC/AST) results are to be included in this reporting of individual results. Settings: Infection Surveillance can occur in any inpatient location where such infections may be identified and where denominato r data can be collected, which may include critical/intensive care units (ICU), specialty care areas (SCA), neonatal units, step -down units, wards, an d chronic care units. In Labor, Delivery, Recovery, & Post -partum (LDRP) locations, where mom and babies a re housed together, users must count both mom and baby in the denominator. If moms only are being counted, then multiply moms times two to include both mom and baby in denominators. Requirements: Sur veillance for all types of NHSN-defined healthcare-associ ated infections (HAIs) , regardless if HAI is included in \"in-plan\" or \"off - plan\" surveillance, of the MDRO selected for monitoring in at least one location in the healthcare facility as indicated in the Patient Safety Monthly Reporting Plan (CDC 57.106) . Definitions: MDROs included in this module are defined in Section I, Option 1A. Refer to CDC/NHSN Surveillance Definitions for Specific Types of Infections f or infection site criteria. Location of Attribution and Transfer Rule applies - See Identifying HAIs in NHSN ( Chapter 2 ). Reporting Instructions : If participating in MDRO/CDI Infection Surveillance and/or LabID Event Reporting, along with the reporting of HAIs throu gh the Device -Associated and/or Procedure-Associated Modules, see Appendix 1: Guidance for Handling MDRO/CDI Module Infection Surveillance and LabID Event Reporting When Also Following Other NHSN Modules f or instructions on unique reporting scenarios. Numerator Data: Number of healthcare-associated infections, by MDRO type. Infections are reported on the appropriate NHSN forms: Primary Bloodstream Infection, Pneumonia, Ventilator -Associated Event, Urinary Tract Infection, Surgical Site Infection, or . See the Table of Instructions , located in each of the applicable chapters , for completion instructions. Denominator Data: Number of patient days and admissions. Patient days and admissions are reported by location using the MDRO and CDI Monthly Denominator Form (CDC 57.127). See Table of Instructions for completion instructions. Data Analysis: Data are stratified by time ( for example, month, quarter, etc.) and patient care location. MDRO Infection Incidence Rate = Number of HAIs by MDRO type / Number of patient days x 1 000 January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-37 2B. Surveillance, reporting on all NHSN-defined healthcare -associated CDIs from at least one patient care area, is one reporting option for C . difficile (part of your facility's Monthly Reporting Plan). These data will enhance the ability of NHSN to aggregate national data on CDIs. Settings: Infection Surveillance will occur in any inpatient location where denominator data can be collected, which may include critical/intensive care units (ICU), specialty care areas (SCA), step-down units, wards, and chronic care units. Surveillance will NOT be performed in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU), Specialty Care Nurseries (SCN), babies in LDRP, or well-baby nurseries. If LDRP locations are being monitored, baby counts must be removed. Requirem ents: Surveillance for CDI must be performed in at least one location in the healthcare institution as indicated in the Patient Safety Monthly Reporting Plan (CDC 57.106). Definitions: Report all healthcare -associated infections where C . difficile , identified by a positive toxin result including toxin producing gene [PCR]) , is the associated pathogen , according to the Repeat Infection Timeframe (RIT) rule for HAIs (See Identifying HAIs in NHSN chapter ). Refer to specific definitions in CDC/NHSN Surveillance Definitions for Specific Types of Infections chapter for C. difficile gastrointestinal system infection (GI -CDI ). HAI c ases of CDI that meet criteria for a healthcare-associated infection should be reported as Clostridioides difficile gastro intestinal system infection (GI -CDI ). Report pathogen as C. difficile on the MDRO or CDI Infection Event form (CDC 57.126). If the patient develops GI -CDI, and GI -GE or GI-GIT, report the GI-CDI and the GI- GE or GI -GIT only if additional enteric organisms are identified and applicable criteria are met. Note: CDI laboratory -identified event (LabID -onset, community -onset healthcare facility-associated) do not apply to HAIs including C. difficile associated gastrointestinal system infections (GI -CDI). Each new GI -CDI must be reported according to the HAI rules outlined in Identifying HAIs in NHSN ch apter 2. CDI Complications: CDI in a case patient within 30 days after CDI symptom onset with at least one of the following: 1. Admission to an intensive care unit for complications associated with CDI ( for example: for shock that requires vasopressor therapy); Surger y (for example, colectomy) for toxic megacolon, perforation, or refractory colitis AND/OR 3. Death caused by CDI within 30 days after symptom onset and occurring during the hospital admission. Location of Attribution and Transfer Rule apply to Infection Sur veillance - See Identifying HAIs in NHSN chapter . MDRO Data: Number of healthcare -associated C. difficile infections. Infections are reported on the MDRO or CDI Infection Event form (CDC 57.126). See Tables of Inst ructions for completion instructions. Denominator Data: Number of patient day s and admission s by location are reported using the MDRO and CDI Monthly Denominator Form (CDC 57.127). See Ta bles of Instructions for completion instructions. C. difficile Infections: Numerator: The total number of HAI CDI cases identified during the surveillance month for a location . Denominator: The total number of patient days and admissions during the su rveillance month for a location . Data Analysis: Data are stratified by time ( for example, month, quarter, etc.) and by patient care location. C. difficile Infection Incidence R ate = Number of HAI CDI cases / Number of patient days x 10,000 January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-39 Section II. Supplemental Reporting 1. Prevention Process Measures Surveillance a. Monitoring Adherence to Hand Hygiene Introduction: This option will allow facilities to monitor adherence to hand hygiene after a healthcare worker (HCW) has contact with a patient or inanimate object(s) in the immediate vicinity of the patient. Research studies have reported data suggesting that improved after-contact hand hygiene is associated with reduced MDRO transmission. While there are multiple opportunities for hand hygiene during patient care, for the purpose of this option, only hand hygiene after contact with a patient or inanimate object(s) in the immediate vicinity of the patient will be observed and reported. ( http://www.cdc.gov/handhygiene/ ) Settings: Surveillance will occur in any location: inpatient or outpatient. Requirements: Surveillance for adherence to hand hygiene in at least one location in the healthcare institution for at least one calendar month as indicated in the Patient Safety Monthly Reporting Plan (CDC 57.106). This should be done in patient care locations also selected for Infection Surveillance or LabID Event reporting. In participating patient care locations, perform at least 30 different unannounced observations after contact with pa tients for as many individual HCWs as possible. For example, try to observe all types of HCWs performing a variety of patient care tasks during the course of the month, not only nurses, or not only during catheter or wound care. No personal identifiers w ill be collected or reported. Definitions: Antiseptic handwash: Washing hands with water and soap or other detergents containing an antiseptic agent. Antiseptic hand -rub: Applying an antiseptic hand -rub product to all surfaces of the hands to reduce the number of microorganisms present. Hand hygiene: A general term that applies to either: handwashing, antiseptic hand wash, antiseptic hand rub, or surgical hand antisepsis. Handwashing: Washing hands with plain ( specifically, non-antimicrobial) soap and water. Numerator: Hand Hygiene Performed = Total number of observed contacts during which a HCW touched either the patient or inanimate objects in the immediate vicinity of the patient and appropriate hand hygiene was perform ed. Denominator: Hand Hygiene Indicated = Total number of observed contacts during which a HCW touched either the patient or inanimate objects in the immediate vicinity of the patient and therefore, appropriate hand hygiene was indicated . January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-40 Hand hygiene pr ocess measure data are reported using the MDRO and CDI Monthly Denominator Form (CDC 57. 127). See Tables of Instructions for completion instructions. Data Analysis: Data are stratified by time ( for example, month, quarter, etc.) and patient care location. Hand Hygiene Percent Adherence = Number of contacts for which hand hygiene was performed / Number of contacts for wh ich hand hygiene was indicated x 100 b. Monitoring Adherence to Gown and Gloves Use as Part of Contact Precautions Introduction: This option will allow facilities to monitor adherence to gown and gloves use when a HCW has contact with a patient or inanimate object(s) in the immediate vicinity of the patient, when that patient is on Transm ission-based Contact Precautions. While numerous aspects of adherence to Contact Precautions could be monitored, this surveillance option is only focused on the use of gown and gloves. (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/gl_isolation_contact.html ) Settings: Surveillance can occur in any of 4 types of inpatient locations: (1) intensive care units (ICU), (2) specialty care areas, (3) neonatal intensive care units (NICU), and (4) any other inpatient care location in the institution (for example, surgical wards). Requirements: Surveillance for adherence to gown and gloves use in at least one location in the healthcare instit ution for at least 1 calendar month as indicated in the Patient Safety Monthly Reporting Plan (CDC 57. 106) . Ideally, this should be done in patient care locations also selected f or Infection Surveillance or LabID Event reporting. Among patients on Transmission -based Contact Precautions in participating patient care locations, perform at least 30 unannounced observations. A total of thirty different contacts must be observed monthly among HCWs of varied occupation types. For example, try to observe all types of HCWs performing a variety of patient care tasks during the course of the month, not only nurses, or not only during catheter or wound care. Both gown and gloves must be d onned appropriately prior to contact for compliance. No personal identifiers will be collected or reported. Definitions: Gown and gloves use: In the context of Transmission -based Contact Precautions, the donning of both a gown and gloves prior to cont act with a patient or inanimate object(s) in the immediate vicinity of the patient. Both a gown and gloves must be donned appropriately prior to contact for compliance. Numerator: Gown and Gloves Used = Total number of observed contacts between a HCW and a patient or inanimate object(s) in the immediate vicinity of a patient on Transmission -based Contact Precautions for which gown and gloves had been donned appropriately prior to the contact. Denominator: Gown and Gloves Indicated = Total number of observed contacts between a HCW and a patient on Transmission -based Contact Precautions or inanimate objects in the immediate vicinity of the January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-41 patient and therefore, gown and gloves were indicated. Gown and gloves use process measure data are reported using the MDRO and CDI Monthly Denominator Form (CDC 57.127). See Tables of Instructions for completion instructions. Data Analysis: Data are stratified by time ( for example, month, quarter, etc.) and patient care location. Gown and Glove Use Percent Adherence = Number of contacts for which gown and gloves were used appropriately / Number of contacts for which gown and gloves were indicated x 100 c. Monitoring Adherence to Active Surveillance Testing Introduction: This option will allow facilities to monitor adherence to active surveillance testing (AST) of MRSA and/or VRE, using culturing or other methods. Settings: Surveillance will occur in any of 4 types of inpatient locations: (1) intensive ca re units (ICU), (2) specialty care areas , (3) neonatal intensive care units (NICU), and (4) any other inpatient care location in the institution (for example, surgical wards). Requirements: Surveillance of AST adherence in at least one location in the healthcare facility for at least one calendar month as indicated in the Patient Safety Monthly Reporting Plan (CDC 57.106). A facility may choose to report AST for MRSA and/or VRE i n one or multiple patient care locations, as the facility deems appropriate. Ideally, this should be done in patient care locations also selected for Infection Surveillance or LabID Event reporting. To improve standardization of timing rules for AST specimen collection, classify admission specimens as those obtained on day 1 (admission date), day 2, or day 3 ( specifically, less than or equal to 3 days). Classify discharge/transfer AST specimens as those collected on or after day 4 (specifically, more than 3 days). Definitions: AST Eligible Patients : Choose one of two methods for identifying patients that are eligible for AST: All = All patients in the selected patient care area regardless of history of MRSA or VRE infection or colonization. OR NHx = All patients in the selected patient care area who have NO documented positive MRSA or VRE infection or colonization during the previous 12 months (as ascertained by either a facility's laboratory records or information provided by referring faciliti es); and no evidence of MRSA or VRE during stay in the patient care location ( specifically , they are not in Contact Precautions). Timing of AST : Choose one of two methods for reporting the timing of AST: Adm = Specimens for AST obtained less than or equal to 3 days after admission, OR Both = Specimens for AST obtained less than or equal to 3 days after admission and, for patients' stays of more than 3 days, at the time of discharge/transfer. Discharge/transfer AST should January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-42 include all discharges (including discharges from the facility or to other wards or deaths) and can include the most recent weekly AST if performed more than 3 days after admission to the patient care location. Discharge/transfer AST should not be performed on patients who tested positive on AST admission. Numerator and Denominator Data: Use the MDRO and CDI Monthly Denominator Form (CDC 57.127) to indic ate: 1) AST was performed during the month for MRSA and/or VRE, 2) AST -eligible patients, and 3) the timing of AST. No personal identifiers will be collected or reported. See Tables of Instructions for completion instructions. Numerator: For each month during which AST is performed: Admission AST Performed = Number of patients eligible for admission AST who had a specimen obtained for testing less than or equal to 3 days after admission, AND/OR Discharge/Transfer AST Performed = For patients' stays more than 3 days, the number of discharged or transferred patients eligible for AST who had a specimen obtained for testing prior to discharge, not including the admission AST. Denominator: For each month during which AST is perfo rmed: Admission AST Eligible = Number of patients eligible for admission AST (All or NHx), AND/OR Discharge/Transfer AST Eligible = Number of patients eligible for discharge/transfer AST (All or NHx) AND in the facility location more than 3 days AND negative if tested on admission. Data Analysis: Data are stratified by patient care location and time ( for example, month, quarter, etc.), according to AST -eligible patients monitored and the timing of AST. Admission AST Percent Adherence = Number of patients with admission AST Performed / Number of patients admission AST eligible x 100 Discharge/transfer AST Percent Adherence = Number of patients with discharge/transfer AST performed / Number of patients discharge/transfer AST eligible x 100 January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-43 2. Active Surveillance Testing Outcome Measures Introduction: This option will allow facilities to use the results of AST to monitor the prevalent and incident rates of MRSA and/or VRE colonization or infection. This information will assist facilities in assessing the impact of intervention programs on MRSA or VRE transmission. Settings: Surveillance will occur in any of 4 types of inpatient locations: (1) intensive care units (ICU), (2) specialty care, (3) neonatal intensive care units (NICU), and (4) any other inpatient care location in the institution ( for exa mple, surgical wards). Requirements: Surveillance for prevalent and/or incident MRSA or VRE cases in at least one location in the healthcare facility for at least one calendar month as indicated in the Patient Safety Monthly Reporting Plan ( CDC 57.106). This can be done ONLY in locations where AST adherence is being performed. A minimum AST adherence level will be required for the system to calculate prevalence and incidence. A facility may choose to report AST for MRSA and/or VRE in one or multiple patient care locations, as the facility deems appropriate. Ideally, this should be done in patient care locations also selected for Infection Surveillance or LabID Event reporting. To improve standardization of timing rules for AST specimen collection, classify admission specimens as those obtained on day 1 (admission date), day 2, or day 3 ( specifically , less than or equal to 3 days). Classify discharge/transfer AST specimens as th ose collected on or after day 4 ( specifically, more than 3 days). Only the first specimen positive for MRSA or VRE from a given patient in the patient care location is counted, whether obtained for AST or as part of clinical care. If an Admission AST specimen is not collected from an eligible patient, assume the patient has no MRSA or VRE colonization . Definitions: AST Admission Prevalent case: Known Positive = A patient with documentation on admission of MRSA or VRE colonization or infection in the previous 12 months ( specifically, patient is known to be colonized or infected as ascertained by either a facility's laboratory records or information provided by referring facilities). (All MRSA or VRE colonized patients currently in a location during the month of surveillance should b e considered \"Known Positive\"), OR Admission AST or Clinical Positive = A patient with MRSA or VRE isolated from a specimen collected for AST less than or equal to 3 days after admission or from clinical specimen obtained less than or equal to 3 days after admission ( specifically , MRSA or VRE cannot be attributed to this patient care location). AST Incident case: A patient with a stay more than 3 days: With no documentation on admission of MRSA or VRE colonization or infection during the previous 12 month s (as ascertained either by the facility's laboratory records or information provided by referring facilities); including admission AST or clinical culture obtained less than or equal to 3 days after admission ( specifically, patient without positive specimen), January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-44 AND With MRSA or VRE isolated from a specimen collected for AST or clinical reasons more than 3 days after admission to the patient care location or at the time of discharge/transfer from the patient care location (including discharges from the facility or to other locations or deaths). MRSA colonization: Carriage of MRSA without evidence of infection ( for example, nasal swab test positive for MRSA, without signs or symptoms of infection). AST Eligible Patients : Choose one of two methods for identifying patients' eligible for AST: All = All patients in the selected patient care area regardless of history of MRSA or VRE infection or colonization, OR NHx = All patients in the selected patient care area who have NO documented positive MRSA or VRE infection or colonization during the previous 12 months (as ascertained either by the facility's laboratory records or information provided by referring facilities); and no evidence of MRSA or VRE during stay in the patient care location. Timing of AST : Choose one of two methods for reporting the timing of AST: Adm = Specimens for AST obtained less than or equal to 3 days after admission, OR Both = Specimens for AST obtained less than or equal to 3 days after admission and, for patients' stays of more than 3 days, at the time of discharge/transfer. Discharge/transfer AST should include all discharges (including discharges from the facility or to other wards or deaths) and can include the most recent weekly AST if performed more than 3 days after admission to the patient care location. Discharge/transfer AST should not be performed on patients who tested positive on AST admission. Numerator and Denominator Data: Use the MDRO and CDI Monthly Denominator Form (CDC 57.127) to indicate: 1) AST outcomes monitoring and adherence was performed during the month for MRSA and/or VRE, 2) AST eligible patients, and 3) the timing of AST. No personal identifiers will be collected or reported. See Tables of Instructions for completion instructions. If only admission AST is performed, only prevalent cases of MRSA or VRE can be detected in that patient care location. If both admission and discharge/transfer AST are performed, both prevalent and incident cases can be detected. No personal identifiers will be collected or reported. Admission Prevalent Case: Numerator Sources : (1) Known Positive; (2) Admission AST or Clinical Positive = Cases less than or equal to 3 days after admission Denominator Source : Total number of admissions Incident Case: Numerator: Discharge/transfer AST or Clinical Positive = Cases more than 3 days after admission and without positive test result(s) on admission January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-45 Denominator: Total number of patient days Note: For research purposes calculating patient -days at risk ( specifically, excluding patient -days in which patients were known to be MRSA or VRE colonized or infected) may be a preferable denominator, but for surveillance purposes and ease of aggregating, total number of patient days is required for this module. Data Analysis: Data are stratified by patient care location and time ( for example, month, quarter, etc.) according to the eligible patients monitored and timing of AST. AST Admission Prevalence rate = For Eligible patients = All: Number of admission AST or clinical positive / Number of admissions x 100 For Eligible patients = NHx: Number of admission AST or clinical positive + Number of known p ositive / Number of admissions x 100 AST Incidence rate = Number of discharge/transfer AST or clinical pos itive / Number of patient days x 1000 1HICPAC, Management of Multidrug -Resistant Organisms in Healthcare Settings. <htps://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/index.html >. 2Cohen AL, et al.

Guidance for Handling MDRO and CDI Module Infection Surveillance and LabID Event Reporting When Also Following Other NHSN Modules If a facility is monitoring CLABSIs, CAUTIs, VAPs, or VAEs within the Device -Associated Module and/or SSIs within the Procedure -Associated Module and is also monitoring MDROs (for example, MRSA) in the MDRO and CDI Module, then there are a few situations where reporting the infection or LabID event may be confusing. The following scenarios provide guidance to keep the counts and rates consistent throughout your facility and between all of the NHSN Modules. Device -Associated Module with MDRO and CDI Module 1: Facility is following CLABSI, CAUTI, VAP, or VAE along with MDRO Infection Surveillance and possibly LabID Event Reporting in the same location: Healthcare-associated Infection identified for this location. 1. Report the infection (BSI, UTI, PNEU , or VAE ). 2. Answer \"Yes\" to the MDRO infection question. This fulfills the infection report ing requirements of both modules in one entry and lets the NHSN reporting tool know that this infection should be included in both the Device -Associated and the MDRO infection datasets and rates. 3. If following LabID event reporting in the same location , report also (separately) as a LabID E vent (if meets the MDRO protocol criteria for LabID event) . Scenario 2 : Facility is following BSI (CLABSI), UTI (CAUTI), PNEU/VAP, or VAE along with MDRO Infection Surveillance and possibly LabID Event Repor ting in multiple locations : The event date for the infection is the day of patient transfer from one location (the transferring location) to another location (the new location), or the next day. 1. Report the i nfection (BSI, UTI, PNEU and VAE) and attribute to the transferring location , if transferring location was following that Event Type (BSI, UTI, PNEU, VAE) on the day of Event, which occurred on the date of transfer, or the following day. 2. A nswer \"Yes\" to the MDRO infection question , if the transferring location was following that MDRO on the day of Event, which occurred on the date of transfer, or the following day. 3. If, o n the date of culture collection, the new location is following LabID event reporting, report also (separately) as a LabID E vent and attribute to the new location (if meets the MDRO protocol criteria for LabID event) . Procedure -Associated Module with MDRO and CDI Module Note: SSIs are associated to a specific procedure and not a patient location ; MDRO event s are conne cted with the patient location. January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-47 Scenario 3 : Facility is following SSI along with MDRO Infection Surveillance and possibly LabID Event Reporting : Patient has surgery, is transferred to a single unit for the remainder of the stay, and during the current stay acquires an SSI . 1. Report the infection (SSI) and attribute to the post -op location. 2. Answer \"Yes\" to the MDRO infection question, if the post -op location is following that MDRO during the month of the date of event. 3. If following LabID event reporting in the post -op location, report also (separately) as a LabID Event (if organism meets the MDRO protocol criteria for LabID event) . Scenario 4 : Facility is following SSI along with MDRO Infection Surveillance and possibly La bID Event Reporting : Patient has surgery, is either discharged immediately (outpatient) or transferred to a unit (inpatient), is d ischarged, and subsequently is readmitted with an SSI. 1. Report the infection (SSI) and attribute to the discharging (post-op ) location (not the readmission location ). 2. Ans wer \"Yes\" to the MDRO infection question, if the discharging (post -op) location was following that MDRO during the Date of Event. 3. If following LabID event reporting in the readmitting location or outpatient clinic where the specimen was collected, report also (separately) as a LabID Event (if organism meets the MDRO protocol criteria for LabID event) . January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-48 Appendix 2: FacWideIN Denominator Counts For the purpose of NHSN surveillance and reporting, a 24-hour observation area is mapped as an outpatient unit, and time spent in this type of unit does not contribute to inpatient counts ( specifically , patient days, device days, admissions). Stays in such outpatient units represent \"encounters\" for the purp oses of LabID Event monitoring in the MDRO/CDI module. The NHSN instructions for recording the number of patients in an inpatient unit state that for each day of the month selected, at the same time each day, the number of patients on the unit should be recorded. This procedure should be followed regardless of the patient's billing status as an observation patient or an inpatient. Key point -- it is the patient's physical location and NOT the patient's admission status that determines whether the patien t counts for an inpatient location or the 24 - hour observation location 1. Observation patient in observation location: When an observation patient is housed in a location that is mapped as a 24 -hr Observation area, they should not be included in any inpat ient counts. These areas are considered outpatient locations. 2. Observation patient in inpatient location: a. If an observation patient is transferred to an inpatient location: LabID event reporting -- Only patient days in the inpatient location are to be included in patient day counts for the location or FacWideIN. These counts should be inclusive of all patients housed in the inpatient location, regardless of their admission status as an observation patient. b. If an observation patient is admitt ed to an inpatient location, the patient must be included in all surveillance events designated in the monthly reporting plan and included in patient and device day counts. The patient is being housed, monitored, and cared for in an inpatient location and therefore is at risk for acquisition of an HAI. The facility assignment of the patient as an observation patient or an inpatient has no bearing for the purpose of counting. January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-49 Below is an example of attributing patient days to a patient admitted to an inpatient location, regardless of whether the facility considers the patient an observation patient or an inpatient . The examples show counts taken at: A) 12:00 am and B) 11:00 pm. A. Count at 12:00 am (midnight): Date Mr X Pt Day Mr Y Pt Day 01/01 Mr X admitted at 8:00 pm Mr X not counted because the count for 01/01 was taken at 12:00 am on 01/01 and he was not yet admitted X Mr Y admitted at 12:00 am Mr Y is counted because the count for 01/01 was taken at 12:00 am and that is when he was admitted 1 01/02 1 2 01/03 2 3 01/04 3 4 01/05 Mr X discharged at 5:00 pm 4 Counted for 01/05 because he was in the hospital at 12:00 am on 01/05 when the count for that day was taken Mr Y discharged at 12:01 am 5 Counted for 01/05 because he was in the hospital at 12:00 am on 01/05 when the count for that day was taken Total 4 patient days 5 patient days If we use the same admission dates and times for Mr . X, but a different time is selected for the patient day count, for example 11:00 pm, the total number of days in the count will be the same; they will simply be coming from different dates. When converting from manual data collection to an electronic counting system, the data must be checked to ensure that all appropriate patients are included or excluded from those counts and that, for three consecutive months, your electronic data are within +/- 5% of the number obtained by manual counts. If these coun ts are more than 5% discrepant, then you will need to evaluate and determine the cause of the discrepancies and methods to address them. When converting from one electronic counting system to another electronic counting system, the new electronic system should be validated against manual counts as above. If electronic counts for the new electronic system are not within 5% of manual counts, resume manual counting and continue working to improve design of electronic denominator data extraction (while reporting manual counts) until concurrent counts are within 5% for 3 consecutive months. January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-50 Note: This guideline is important because validating a new electronic counting system against an existing electronic system can magnify errors and result in inaccurate denominator counts. The main goal is to accurately count patients in the denominators that may contribute to the numerator. B. Count at 11:00 pm: Date Mr X Pt Day 01/01 Mr X admitted at 8:00 am Counted because the count for 01/01 is taken at 11:00 pm on 01/01 and he is in the hospital at that time 1 01/02 - 2 01/03 - 3 01/04 - 4 01/05 MR X discharged at 5:00 pm Not counted for 01/05 because he was not in the hospital at 11:00 pm on 01/05 when the count for that day was taken X Total - 4 patient days Determining Admission Counts for Summary Data Collection: Recognizing there are a variety of ways in which patient day and admission counts are obtained for a facility and for specific locations, this guidance is offered to assist with standardization within and across facilities. How you operationalize this guidance will depend on how you are obtaining the data for your counts. It is most important that whatever method is used by a facility, it should be used each and every month for consistency of data and metrics. 1. Facility-Wide Inpatient Admission Count : Include any new patients that are assigned to a bed in any inpatient location within the facility regardless of billing status. Qualification as a new patient means that the patient was not present on the previous calendar day . The daily admission counts are summed at the end of the calendar month for a monthly facility -wide inpatient admission count. 2. Inpatient Location-Specific Admission Count : Include any new patients that are assigned to a bed in the specific inpatient location. Qualification as a new patient means that the patient was not present in the specific inpatient location on the previous calendar day. The daily admission counts are summed at the end of the calendar month for a monthly inpatient location-specific admission count. Any patient who meets criteria for new inclusion should be counted, regardless of whether they are coded by the facility as an inpatient or as an observation patient. January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-51 Below is an example of manually counting location -specific and facility -wide admission counts related to a patient admitted to an i npatient location and transferred to multiple patient locations during his hospital stay. The example shows counts taken at 11:00 pm. Example: Counts at 11:00 pm: Unit Date/Time Mr. X Placed on Inpatient Unit Date/Time Mr. X Transferred Out of Inpatient Unit Inpatient Location-Specific Admission Count Inpatient Facility - Wide Admission Count SICU 10/08 - 10:00am (facility admission) 10/13 - 9:00am MICU 10/13 - 9:15am 10/13 - 11:00am Not present and so not counted Same Adm, and also not present so not counted Surgical Ward 10/13 - 11:30am 10/25 - 1:00pm 1 Adm for Surgical Ward Same Adm so not counted Medical Ward 10/25 - 1:30pm 10/26 - 10:00am (facility discharge) 1 Adm for Medical Ward Same Adm so not counted January 2023 MDRO & CDI Module 12-52 Appendix 3: Differentiating Between LabID Event and Infection Surveillance Topic LabID Event Infection Surveillance (using HAI surveillance definitions) Protocol LabID Event protocol in Chapter 12 of NHSN manual Infection Surveillance protocol in Chapter 12 of NHSN manual and HAI site -specif ic definitions in NHSN manual (for example, BSI, UTI, SSI, PNEU, VAE, and GI -CDI and other HAI definitions) Signs & Symptoms NONE.

To participate in either option, facility personnel responsible for reporting antimicrobial use (AU) or resistance (AR) data to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) must coordinate with their pharmacy and/or laboratory information software providers to configure their system to generate standard formatted f ile(s) to be imported into NHSN. The format provided for data submission follows the Health Level 7 (HL7) Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) s tandard.7 Manual data entry is not available for the AUR Module. Facilities can participate in one (AU or AR) or both (AU and AR) options. Pu rpose The NHSN AUR Module provides a mechanism for facilities to report and to analyze antimicrobial use and/or resistance data to inform benchmarking, reduce antimicrobial resistant infect ions through antimicrobial stewardship , and interrupt transmission of resistant pathogens at individual facilities or facility networks.6January 2023 Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module AUR 14-2 1. Antimicrobial Use (AU) Option Introduction Antimicrobial resistance rates continue to increase in hospitals across the United States .1 One of the five CDC core actions to combat the spread of antimicrobial resistance is improving the use of antimicrobials.2 Studies show that providing timely and reliable feedback of information to clinicians regarding their prescribing practices, such as through antimicrobial usage reports, can improve appropriateness of antimicrobial use.3-5 Objectives : The primary objective of the Antimicrobial Use (AU) O ption is to facilitate risk-adjusted inter - and intra -facility antimicr obial use benchmarking. A secondary objective is to evaluate antimicrobial use trends over time at the facility and national levels. Methodology: The p rimary antimicrobial use metric reported to the AU Option is antimicrobial days per 1,000 days present. An a ntimicrobial day (also known as day of therapy) is defined by any amount of a specific antimicrobial agent administered in a calendar day to a particular patient as documented in the electronic medication administration record (eMAR) and/or bar coding medication record (BCMA) (refer to Numerator Data section starting on page 14 -4 for more information); all antimicrobial days for a specific agent administered across a population are summed in aggregate.8-11 Days present are defined as the aggregate number of patients housed in a patient care location or facility anytime throughout a day during a calendar month (refer to Denominator Data section starting on page 14-6 for more information). For each facility, the numerator (antimicrobial days ) is aggregated by month for each patient care location and overall for inpatient areas facility-wide (specifically, facility-wide inpatient or FacWideIN) . Similarly, the denominator (days present) is calculated for the corresponding patient care- location -month or facility- wide inpatient -month. A secondary antimicrobial use metric, antimicrobial days per 100 admissions , is reported to the AU Option for facility -wide inpatient (FacWideIN) data . The numerator and denominator s are further defined below and must adhere to the data format prescribed by the HL7 CDA Implementation Guide developed by the CDC and HL7 .7 Manual data entry is not available for the NHSN AU Option. Settings: All inpatient facilities enrolled in NHSN and reporting to the Patient Safety Component can participate in the AU Option. This includes facilities enrolled as general hospitals, critical access hospitals, children's hospitals, long term acute care hospitals, pediatric long term acute care hospitals, military and veterans' hospitals, oncology hospitals, orthopedic hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, surgical hospitals, women's hospitals, women's and children's hospitals, government and no n-government hospitals for public health emergencies. Facilities must have the ability to collect the numerator and denominator data electronically and upload those data into NHSN using the required CDA specifications. NHSN does not currently support the submission of data into the AU Option from ambulatory surgery centers, long term care facilities (specifically, skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes) or outpatient dialysis facilities. January 2023 Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module AUR 14-3 NHSN strongly encourages the submission of data from all NHSN -defined inpatient locations (including procedural areas like operating rooms), facility -wide inpatient (FacWideIN), and select outpatient acute care settings ( specifically, outpatient emergency department [ED] , pediatric emergency department [ED] , and 24-hour observation area) from which the numerator and denominator data can be accurately captured. The AU Option does not accept data from other outpatient locations such as outpatient clinics. The FacWideIN record should contain data from all inpatient locations and inpatient procedural areas from which the numerator and denominator can be accurately captured. A comprehensive submission will enable a facility to optimize inter - and/or intra -facility comparisons among specific wards, combined wards, and facility -wide data. NHSN delineates a CDC-defined designation (CDC Location) for patient care areas/locations where patients have similar disease conditions or are receiving care for similar medical or surgical specialties. Each facility location is \"mapped\" to one CDC Location within the NHSN facility . The specific CDC Location code is determined by the type of patients cared for in that area according to the NHSN location mapping algorithm for acuity level and service type. The patient care areas include adult, pediatric, and neonatal units as defined by NHSN Codes. See the NHSN Locations chapte r for more information regarding location mapping. Note: use the same patient care locations throughout NHSN for both AUR and HAI reporting. Facilities should not map separate locations only for AUR reporting. Requirements Each month: 1. The facility must indicate the specific locations from which they plan to submit antimicrobial use data in the Patient Safety Monthly Reporting Plan. a. When reporting AU Option data from inpatient and outpatient locations, list FacWideIN, each individual inpatient location, and each individual outpatient location as separate rows in the plan. 2. The CDA files submitted by the facility contain all data fields outlined in the Table of Ins tructions (Appendix A ) for each location. 3. The facility uploads data via CDA files for all locations indicated in the Monthly Reporting Plan. a. Submit one file for each individual patient care location as well as a separate file for FacWideIN. As an example, a facility with three patient care locations will upload three separate files for each individual location and one additional file for FacWideIN for a total of four files per month. NHSN re commends the facility uploads data into NHSN for a given calendar month by the end of the subsequent calendar month. Numerator Data (Antimicrobial Days): Antimicrobial Days (also known as Days of Therapy) : Defined as the a ggregate sum of days for which a ny amount of a specific antimicrobial agent was administered to individual patients as document ed in the January 2023 Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module AUR 14-4 eMAR and/or BCMA .8-11 Appendix B provides the full list of antimicrobial agents collected in the NHSN AU Option. Aggregate antimicrobial days are reported monthly for inpatient locations, FacWideIN, and three select outpatient acute care settings ( specifically, outpatient ED, pediatric ED, and 24-hour observation area) for select antimicrobial agents and stratified by route of administration ( specifically, intravenous, intramuscular, digestive, and respiratory ). Refer to Table 1 and Table 2 for the definitions of drug-specific antimicrobial days and stratification based on route of administration. For example, when a health care professional administers a patient 1 gram V ancomycin intravenously twice daily for three days , three \"Vancomycin Days (total)\" and three \"Vancomycin Days (IV)\" are counted when stratified by intravenous route of administration. Please note antimicrobials that have an extended half -life, such as Dalbavancin and Oritavancin, are only counted as an antimicrobial day on the day of administration. Similarly, in the case of renal impairment, antimicrobials such as Vancomycin are only counted as an antimicrobial day on the day of administration. Table 3 summarizes the data eleme nts for numerator calculation. Appendix C provides additional examples of antimicrobial day calculation. A value ( specifically, a number greater than or equal to \"1\" , \"0\", or \" NA\") must be reported for every antimicrobial agent and route of administration listed in Appendix B for every location record for each month. Antimicrobial agents and routes of administration cannot be left blank. Facilities should report \"0\" (zero) antimicrobial days when no aggregate use occurred during a given reporting period for a specific antimicrobial agent/route (for example, Zanamivir via the respiratory route) and that agent/route can be accurately captured in the eMAR or BCMA system. Please note, facilities should report \"NA\" (Not Applicable) only when the administrations for an agent/route cannot be electronically captured at that facility (specifically, data are not available for a specific antimicrobial agent/route) . Furthermore, facilities should consistently report \"NA\" across all locations and FacWideIN. For example, if a facility was unable to electronically capture Amikacin administered via the respiratory route (in the event of using the IV formulation for inhalation), the facility would report \"NA\" for the respiratory route of Amikacin for all individual locations and FacWideIN. Facilities should only use \"NA\" for non-formulary agen ts when those agents, if administered, cannot be accurately electronically captured. If use of non -formulary agents can be accurately electronically captured, no use of those agents in each location/month would be reported as \"0\" (zero). The NHSN Team expects use of \"NA\" at a given facility to remain consistent across months (in other words, we would expect facilities unable to electronically capture data for a given agent/route to consistently report \"NA\"). Facilities should not switch back and forth betwe en reporting a use value great er than or equal to zero and \"NA\". January 2023 Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module AUR 14-5 Table 1. Classification and Definition of Routes of Administration for Antimicrobial Days Classification: Route of Admin istrationa Definitionb Intravenous (IV) An intravascular route that begins with a vein. Intramuscular (IM) A route that begins within a muscle. Digestive Tract A route that begins anywhere in the digestive tract extending from the mouth through rectum.c Respiratory Tract A route that begins within the respiratory tract, including the oropharynx and nasopharynx. a Other routes of administration are excluded from the AU Option reporting (for example, antibiotic locks, intraperitoneal, intrapleural, intraventricular, irrigation, topical) and should not be included in the total antimicrobial days nor the sub-stratification of the routes of administration. b Definitions were drawn from SNOMED qualifier value hierarchy. Refer to the CDA Antimicrobial Use (AU) Toolkit for specific codes corresponding to eac h route of administration. c For example, rectal administration of Vancomycin. Table 2.

For example, if Tobramycin was administered to a patient intravenously and via a respiratory route on the same day , the antimicrobial days would be counted as \"one Tobramycin Day (Total)\" and the stratification by route of would be \"one Tobramycin Day (IV)\" and \"one Tobramycin Day (Respiratory)\". b Tobramycin is used f or an example of route stratification only and is not FDA approved for administration via the digestive route. January 2023 Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module AUR 14-6 Table 3. Data Elements for Antimicrobial Days Data Element Details Antimicrobial Agents Defined as select antimicrobial agents and stratified by route of administration (specifically, intravenous, intramuscular, digestive, and respiratory). Refer to Appendix B for a complete list of antimicrobials. The list of select antimicrobials will evolve with time as new agents become commercially available and old agents are removed from the market. Topical antimicrobial agents are not included in the NHSN AU Option. Data source Antimicrobial days are derived from antimicrobial administration data documented in the eMAR and/or BCMA only. Usage derived from other data sources (for example, pharmacy orders, doses dispensed, doses billed) cannot be submitted. Location Antimicrobial days are aggregated for each inpatient location, facility -wide inpatient, and three select outpatient acute- care settings (specifically, outpatient ED, pediatric ED, and 24- hour observation area) per the NHSN location definitions . Time Unit Antimicrobial days for a specific antimicrobial agent and stratification by route of administration are aggregated monthly per location. Denominator Data (Days Present and Admissions): The numerator will be analyzed against the denominator s of days present (all locations) and admissions (for facility-wide inpatient [FacWideIN] only ). The denominators are further defined below. Days present: Days present are defined as the time period during which a given patient is at risk for antimicrobial exposure in a given patient location. The definition of days present differs from the definition of patient days used in other NHSN modules. Days present is further defined below in context of calculation for patient care location -specific analyses and facility -wide inpatient analyses. Please note that a separate calculation for days present is required for each patient care location compared to facility-wide inpatient. For patient care location-specific analyses , days present are calculated as the number of patients who were present, regardless of patient status (for example, inpatient, observation), for any portion of each day during a calendar month for a patient care location. The aggregate measure is calculated by summing days present for that location and month. The day of admission, discharge, and transfer to and from locations will be included in the days present count . Below are examples that illustrate appropriate days present calculation: A patient admitted to the medical ward on Monday and discharged two days later on Wednesday contributes three days present in the medical ward because the patient was present in that specific location at some point during each of the three calendar days (specifically, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday) . On the day a patient is transferred from a medical critical care unit to a medical ward, the patient contributes one day present in the medical critical care unit and one day present in the medical ward because the patient was present in both locations at some point during January 2023 Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module AUR 14-7 that calendar day. Similarly, a patient contributes days present to the operating room or ED if data are submitted from these locations. One patient can only contribute one day present for a specific location per calendar day. While a patient cannot contribute more than one day present to any one unique location on the same day that patient can contribute a day present to two different locations on the same day. For example, a patient transferred from the surgical ward to the operating room and back to the surgical ward in a calendar day contributes one day present to the surgical ward and one day present to the operating room. For facility -wide inpatient (FacWideIN) analyses , days present are calculated as the number of patients who were present in an inpatient location within the facility for any portion of each day during a calendar month. The aggregate measure is calculated by summing up all the days present for facility -wide inpatient for a given month. Thus, a sum of days present from location - specific analyses would be higher than days present for the facility (FacWideIN) because transfers between wards can account for multiple location \" days present \" for a given patient on a single calendar day. Therefore, it is not permissible to sum the individual days present for location -specific analyses to achieve the facility- wide i npatient (FacWideIN) days present count. The calculation must be a separate summation for facility -wide inpatient analyses. Please note that only inpatient locations in which both the antimicrobial days ( numerator ) and the days present ( denominator ) can be accurately electronically captured should be included in the FacWideIN counts. Additionally, outpatient locations (ED, pediatric ED, and 24 -hr observation) should not be included in FacWideIN counts. Admissions : Admissions are defined as the aggregate number of patients admitted to an inpatient location within the facility ( facility-wide inpatient) starting on first day of each calendar month through the last day of the calendar month. A patient is counted as an admission when they arrive in an NHSN designated inpatient location regardless of patient status (for example, inpatient, observation). Further, a patient admitted to an inpatient unit would be counted as an admission even if they were discharged that same calendar day. In the AU Option, admissions are reported only for facility-wide inpatient (FacWideIN) . Please note, the admissions definition used in the AUR Module is different than the definition used in the NHSN MDRO/CDI Module. Table 4. Location- specific and Facility -wide Inpatient Metrics Patient Care Location-Specific Analyses Rate of Antimicrobial Days per 1,000 Days Present \u00d71000 January 2023 Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module AUR 14-8 Notes: One patient can contribute only one day present per calendar day for each specific location. Summed total may be higher when compared to facility -wide count (reflecting transfers between locations). Facility- wide Inpatient Analyses Rate of Antimicrobial Days per 1,000 Days Present \u00d71000 Notes: One patient can contribute only one day present per calendar day for a facility. Thus, one denominator is obtained for all inpatient locations in an entire facility. The day present measure for facility-wide inpatient should be lower when compared to sum total from location -specific comparison. Only include inpatient units where both the antimicrobial days (numerator) and the days present (denominator) can be accurately electronically captured. Exclude outpatient locations. Rate of Antimicrobial Days per 100 Admissions \u00d7100 Notes: Only calculated for facility -wide inpatient for the AU Option. Only include inpatient units where both the antimicrobial days (numerator) and the days present and admissions (denominator s) can be accurately electronically captured. Exclude outpatient locations. Data Analyses All AU Option data reported to NHSN can be analyzed immediately after submission to NHSN . After generating analysis datasets within NHSN, users can view reported da ta using various NHSN analysis reports to visualize and analyze data in more detail. For example, descriptive analysis reports such as line lists, bar charts and pie charts are available. In addition, measures of antimicrobial use are available in rate tab les and SAAR reports. Types of AU Option Analysis Reports January 2023 Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module AUR 14-9 Standardized Antimicrobial Administration Ratio (SAAR): The Standardized Antimicrobial Administration Ratio (SAAR) is a metric developed by CDC to analyze and report antimicrobial use data in summary form. The SAAR is calculated by dividing observed antimicrobial use by predicted antimicrobial use. = The observed antimicrobial use is the number of days of therapy, or antimicrobial days, reported by a facility for a specified category of antimicrobial agents in a specified group of patient care locations. The predicted antimicrobial use is calculated using predictive models developed by CDC and applied to nationally aggregated 2017 adult and pediatric or 2018 neonatal AU data reported to NHSN from the same group of patient care location types. Separate predictive models are developed for each specific antimicrobial agent category. The SAAR can be generated for 22 antimicrobial agent categories (7 adult, 8 pediatric, and 7 neonatal) and 17 specific NHSN location types (8 adult, 5 pediatric, and 4 neonatal), for a total of 47 possible SAARs (see Appendix D ), each of which can serve as a high -value target or high- level indicator for antimicrobial stewardship programs. Th e antimicrobial agent categories were determined by CDC with input from external adult, pediatric, and neonatal infectious disease physicians and pharmacists. The SAAR agent categories are listed below. The specific antimicrobial agents in each category ca n be found in Appendix E . Adult SAAR antimicrobial agent categories o All antibacterial agents o Broad spectrum antibacterial agents predominantly used for hospital -onset infections o Broad spectrum antibacterial agents predominantly used for community -acquired infections o Antibacterial agents predominantly used for resistant Gram-positive infections (e.g., MRSA) o Narrow spectrum beta -lactam agents o Antibacterial agents posing the highest risk for CDI (not mutually exclu sive, agents may overlap with other categories) o Antifungal agents predominantly used for invasive candidiasis Pediatric SAAR antimicrobial agent categories o All antibacterial agents o Broad spectrum antibacterial agents predominantly used for hospital -onset infections o Broad spectrum antibacterial agents predominantly used for community -acquired infections o Antibacterial agents predominantly used for resistant Gram-positive infections (e.g., MRSA) o Narrow spectrum beta -lactam agents o Azithromycin o Antibacterial agents posing the highest risk for CDI (not mutually exclusive, agents may overlap with other categories) January 2023 Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module AUR 14-10 o Antifungal agents predominantly used for invasive antimicrobial agent categories o All neonatal antibacterial agents o Vancomycin predominantly used for treatment of late-onset sepsis o Broad spectrum antibacterial agents predominantly used for hospital -onset infections o Third generation Cephalosporins o Ampicillin predominantly used for treatment of early -onset sepsis o Aminogly cosides predominantly used for treatment of early -onset and late -onset sepsis o Fluconazole predominantly used for candidiasis At present, SAARs are available to facilities that have submitted AU data from one of the 17 eligible adult, pediatric, and neonatal SAAR location types included in Table 5 . As an important note, the SAARs generated in NHSN only include the SAAR eligible location types listed in Table 5. None of the SAARs contain AU data from all inpatient locati ons in a given facility. Therefore, none of the SAARs would be considered a \"facility-wide\" SAAR. In the future, as more facilities submit AU data, the NHSN Team plans to develop SAARs for additional location types.

A SAAR that is not statistically different from 1.0 indicates antimicrobial use is equivalent to the referent population's antimicrobial use. A low SAAR that achieves statistical significance may indicate antimicrobial under -use. Please note, a SAAR alone is not a definitive measure of the appropriateness or judiciousness of antimicrobial use, and any SAAR may warrant further investigation. For example, a SAAR above 1.0 that does not achieve statistical significance may be associated with meaningful excess of anti microbial use and further investigation may be needed. Also, a SAAR that is statistically different from 1.0 does not mean that further investigation will be productive. SAARs can be produced by month, quarter, half year, or year or cumulative time periods. The SAAR report can be modified to show SAARs by a specific location or a subset of location types. However, keep in mind that SAARs can only be generated and/or modifi ed to show data for the 17 select location types listed above in Table 5 . Additional detail and guidance for the SAARs are available in the resources listed below: SAAR Guide : https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/ps -analysis-resources/aur/au -508.pdf Targeted The Targeted Assessment for Antimicrobial Stewardship (TAS) is a framework for quality improvement developed by the CDC to use NHSN AU Option data for action to optimize AU at facilities. TAS is available to hospitals participating in the NHSN AU Option. TAS can be used by antimicrobial stewards and others focused on optimizing AU within groups, such as health departments and health systems, as well as individual facilities. The TAS Reports use a metric called the antimicrobial use cumulative attributable difference ( AU-CAD ). The AU -CAD represents the difference between the observed days and a selected Standardized Antimicrobial Administration Ratio (SAAR) target. The TAS Reports allow for ranking facilities within groups, or location groups and locations within individual fa cilities, by the AU -CAD, to identify where stewardship efforts may have the greatest impact. Since the SAAR is not a definitive measure of the appropriateness or judiciousness of AU, CDC cannot define SAAR targets for facilities or groups. Facilities and groups, however, can use their information on antibiotic use (for example, a medication use January 2023 Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module AUR 14-12 evaluation to assess appropriate courses of therapy) to establish improvement goals that can then be monitored with NHSN AU Option metrics (for example, the AU -CAD and SAAR). The AU -CAD is the number of antimicrobial days needed to achieve a desired SAAR target. The higher the AU -CAD value, the greater the number of antimicrobial days that need to be reduced to meet the SAAR target. For example, if a facility has a n AU -CAD of 75 when they run a TAS report with a SAAR target of 0.95, the interpretation would be \"The facility would have needed 75 fewer antimicrobial days to reach their SAAR target of 0.95 during this time period.\" TAS Reports are located within the Analysis section of NHSN. You'll notice the TAS Reports have their own subfolder within the Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module folder. T he TAS reports are separated by population (adult, pediatric, or neonatal) and by level of aggregation (group, facil ity, location group, and location). TAS reports include only those location types that can generate SAARs; in other words, the same locations in the SAAR reports will also be included in the TAS reports. Table 6.

In other words, the SAAR Types are ranked based on location group AU -CAD val ue within that specific location group. Location groups (Combined): Rank is based on location group SAAR Type AU-CAD values among all SAAR Types and location groups. In other words, SAAR Types and location groups are ranked according to the AU-CAD value al one. Locations o AU-CAD values are provided for each individual location able to generate SAARs (see Table 6). Separately, t he TAS Dashboard allows NHSN facilities to visualize locations with the greatest need for antimicrobial stewardship. The TAS Dashboard displays AU-CADs over time, by quarter, for the most recent complete four calendar quarters at the group, facility, and l ocation level. Unlike the TAS Reports, the time period and level of aggregation displayed by the TAS Dashboard cannot be changed. January 2023 Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module AUR 14-14 Additional detail and guidance for the TAS reports and dashboards are available in the resources listed below: TAS -analysis-resources/tas/tas-guide-508.pdf TAS Report https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/ps -analysis-resources/tas/group-508.pdf Rates: As a supplement to the SAARs, rate tables showing the pooled mean rates and percentile distributions of specific antimicrobials for specific adult, pediatric and neonatal locations are available. Adult and pediatric SAAR location types can generate rates for antimicrobials predominantly used for extensively antimicrobial resistant bacteria. This rate table shows the antimicrobial days per 1,000 days present for a grouping of five specific drugs (listed in Appendix E ) along with the pooled mean rate and percentile distributions for the 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles based on the 2017 baseline adult and pediatric AU data. Rates can also be generated for well baby and special care (Level II) neonatal nurseries for select antimicrobial groupings. These rate tables show the antimicrobial days per 1,000 days present for specific antimicrobial groupings (listed in Appendix E) along with the pooled mean rate and percentile distributions for the 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles based on the 2018 baseline neonatal AU data. SAAR Baseline Rate Tables : https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/ps -analysis-resources/aur/au -qrg-ratetable - drugs -508.pdf Additionally, users can gener ate basic rate tables as incidence density rates of antimicrobial days per 1,000 days present stratified by patient care location and facility- wide inpatient. A rate of antimicrobial days per 100 admissions can also be generated for facility-wide inpatient only. Default rate tables can be generated by antimicrobial category (specifically, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-influenza, antiviral) and class (for example, aminoglycosides, carbapenems, cephalosporins) for the most recent month of data submitted or all months of data submitted for FacWideIN or each individual location. Modifications can be made to any rate table to show specific months or locations. Specific rate tables can also be modified to produce a rate per individual antimicrobial, select antimicrobials within the same class, and select antimicrobials within different classes.

Table 1 provides an example of administered doses for this patient documented in eMAR. Table 2 illustrates the calculation of Meropenem and Amikacin days by antimicrobial (total) and stratified by route of administration based on the administered doses of Meropenem and Amikacin documented in eMAR. Table 3 illust rates the contribution of this patient's antimicrobial days to the aggregate monthly report per patient care location. Table 1.

Differences in Calcul ations for Patient Care Location and Facility-Wide Inpatient for a Patient Transfer red Between Patient Care Locations This example illustrates the antimicrobial days calculation for a patient receiving 1 gram Vancomycin every 8 hours that was transferred from the MICU to a medical ward on December 1. Table 1 provides an example of doses documented in eMAR administered to this patient in the MICU and Medical Ward. Table 2 illustrates the calculation of Vancomycin days by antimicrobial (total) and stratified by route of administration based on the administered doses of Vancomycin documented in eMAR. One Vancomycin day is attributed to both the MICU and Medical Ward locations since administrations took place in both units during the calendar day. Further, despite receiving two administrations of Vancomycin in the Medical Ward, the patient only attributes one total Vancomycin antimicrobial day for the Medical Ward per calendar day. Table 3 shows the contribution of this patient's Vancomycin days to the aggregate monthly report per location and facility- wide inpatient. Note that while the patient attributes one total Vancomycin day for both the MICU and the Medical Ward on December 1, only one total Vancomycin day can be attributed to the FacWideIN count that calendar day.

Calcula tion of Antimicrobial Days for a Patient Care Location when a Patient Admission extends over Two Different Months This example illustrates the antimicrobial days calculation for a patient receiving 1 gram Ceftriaxone intravenously every 24 hours for two days in the Surgical Ward (but spanning different months). Table 1 provides an example of administered doses for thi s patient documented in eMAR. Table 2 illustrates the calculation of Ceftriaxone days by antimicrobial (total) and stratification of route of administration based upon the administered doses of Ceftriaxone documented in eMAR. Table 3 illustrates the contri bution of this patient's Ceftriaxone days to the aggregate monthly report per patient care location. Note: The patient's FacWideIN admission (denominator) would be attributed to the month the patient was first physically located in an inpatient location w ithin the facility. In the scenario highlighted here, the patient would attribute 1 admission to December and no admission to January (specifically, the patient would not be counted in the total January admissions count). The patient would continue to contribute one day present for each day the patient was in the location/facility. Table 1.

Antimicrobial Resistance (AR) Option Introduction The proportion of isolates resistant to specific antimicrobial agents is a common measure of antimicrobial resistance. Proportion susceptible (%S) can aid in clinical decision making (hospital antibiograms) and assessing the impact of transmission prevention and antimicrobial stewardship success, although the measure may not be very sensitive to measuring success of short -term efforts. Proportion susceptible also facilitates local or regional assessment of progression or improvement of a particular resistan ce problem to guide local or regional transmission prevention efforts. Validity of local and regional assessments of the magnitude of a particular resistance phenotype can be improved by using standardized methodology for aggregating proportion resistant. Objectives: 1. Facilitate antimicrobial resistance data evaluation using a standardized approach to : a. Provide local practitioners with an improved awareness of a variety of antimicrobial resistance problems to aid in clinical decision making and prioritize transmission prevention efforts . b. Provide facility -specific measures in context of a regional and national perspective (specifically, benchmarking) that can inform decisions to accelerate transmission prevention efforts and reverse propagation of emerging or established resistant pathogens. 2. Allow regional and national assessment of antimicrobial resistant organisms of public health importance, including ecologic and infection burden assessment. Methodology: The AR Option reports antimicrobial resistance data as a proportion. 1 The proportion susceptible is defined as the number of susceptible isolates divided by the number of isolates tested for the specific antimicrobial agent being evaluated. For each facility, the numerator (specifically, number of susceptible isolates) is derived from isolate -level reports submitted. The ultimate source of the isolate data included in these reports is the laboratory information system (LIS). Laboratory results data from the electronic health rec ord system (EHRs) can be used to populate the AR Option numerator records submitted to NHSN in healthcare settings where the LIS is directly connected to the EHRs. The AR Option obtains denominators of patient days and admissions from the ADT system (or si milar system that allows for electronic access of required data elements). The sections below further define the numerator and denominator, which must adhere to the data format prescribed by the Health Level 7 (HL7) CDA Implementation Guide developed by the CDC and HL7.2 Manual data entry is not available for the AR Option. S ettings: All inpatient facilities enrolled in NHSN and using the Patient Safety Component can participate in the AR Option. This includes facilities enrolled as general hospitals, critical access hospitals, children's hospitals, long term acute care hospitals, pediatric long term acute care hospitals, military and veterans' hospitals, oncology hospitals, orthopedic hosp itals, psychiatric hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, surgical January 2023 Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module AUR 14-37 hospitals, women's hospitals, women's and children's hospitals, government and non -government hospitals for public health emergencies. Participating facilities must be able to collect the numerator and denominator data electronically and upload those data into NHSN using the required CDA specifications. NHSN does not currently support AR Option data submission from long term care facilities (specifically, skilled nursing facilities and nursing homes) nor outpatient dialysis facilities. NHSN strongly encourages reporting specimens at each facility from all NHSN defined inpatient locations (including inpatient procedural areas like operating rooms) and three select outpatient locations: Emergenc y Department (ED), Pediatric ED, and 24- hour Observation Area. The AR Option does not accept specimens collected in other outpatient location types, such as outpatient clinics. The denominators of patient days and admissions are only reported at the facili ty-wide inpatient level (FacWideIN). The denominator of outpatient encounters is reported separately from the three select outpatient location type s: ED, Pediatric ED, and 24- hour Observation Area. Previous experience with AUR Module implementation suggests that reporting from all NHSN patient care locations is easier than reporting from selected locations. Requirements Each month: 1. The facility must indicate they plan to submit AR Option data on the Patient Safety Monthly Reporting Plan. a. The facility must add FacWideIN to the plan to report AR Option data from inpatient locations. Individual inpatient locations should not be listed in the AR Option plan. b. The facility must add each outpatient location separately to report AR Option data from the three select outpatient locations types. 2. The facility must report two record types for each month of surveillance. a. One event file for each isolate-based report. i. Isolate is defined as a population of a single organism observed in a culture obtained from a patient specimen. ii. Each AR Option event file contains the specific location of specimen collection. iii. Note: If the facility has no AR Events to report (specifically, there were no isolates that met the AR Option inclusion criteria), the facility can select the box on the NHSN Alert screen to report \"No AR Events\". More information can be found here: Rep ort No AR Events Guide . b. One summary file for the FacWideIN denominator data report and one summary file for each outpatient location listed in the reporting plan. NHSN recommends AR Option data be submitted to NHSN for a given calendar month by the end of the subsequent calendar month. However, facilities should wait at least seven calendar days following the end of the month before submitting data to ensure the lab completed all susceptibility testing and reported results back to the EHRs. January 2023 Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module AUR 14-38 Isolate- based report The facility must report all required data each month for each eligible isolate -based report (See Appendix F ). The facility should only consider specimens collected in an inpatient or select outpatient locati on (ED, pediatric ED, and 24 -hour observation) for eligibility. Additionally, the facility should only report specimens to the AR Option with susceptibility testing. For example, if a facility isolates Candida albicans from a urine specimen but does not perform susceptibility testing on that isolate, the isolate is not eligible for reporting to the AR Option. The facility should report all eligible isolates that meet the reporting guidelines outlined in this protocol t o NHSN regardless of the antimicrobia l resistance of the isolated organism. This means that even isolates that are susceptible to all required antimicrobials are eligible to be reported to the AR Option. Additionally, isolates in which all the NHSN required antimicrobials were not tested, but at least one non-required drug was tested, are eligible to be reported into NHSN. For example, if a facility tested a Staphylococcus aureus isolate for the non-required drug Telithromycin and none of the other 27 NHSN required antimicrobials were tested, that isolate would still be considered eligible for reporting to the AR Option. This is consistent with CLSI M39 Guidance on reporting cumulative susceptibility test results. 3 Non-culture based organism identification results (for example, T2 Magnetic Resonance [T2MR] or Karius Test) should not be submitted. R eport two distinct events based on specimens obtained in inpatient and select outpatient locations with susceptibility testing performed: 1. Eac h eligible organism iso lated from an invasive source (blood or cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]) per patient, per 14 day period even across calendar months: a. Ther e should be 14 days with no positive culture result from the laboratory for the patient and specific organism before the fac ility enters another invasive source AR Event into NHSN for the patient and specific organism. NOTE: The date of specimen collection is considered Day 1. b. After >14 days have passed with no positive culture results for that specific organism, the facility c an report another positive culture from an invasive source with that specific organism as an AR Event. For example, if a facility obtained a positive blood culture from a patient on January 1, the earliest another invasive specimen could be reported to NHS N for that same patient and organism would be January 15 (assuming there were no positive blood or CSF cultures in the interim). 2. The first eligible organism isolated from any eligible non-invasive culture source (lower respiratory or urine), per patient, per month. a. On ly one AR event is allowed per calendar month for the same patient/organism for lower respiratory or urine specimens. Note: T he AR Option 14 day rule starts with the day of specimen collection and applies only to those specimens collected in an inpatient location or select outpatient location (ED, pediatric ED, or 24 -hour observation area) in the reporting facility. Outpatient locations other than the ED, pediatric ED, and 24- hour observation area (for example, wound clinic or outpatient labo ratory) should not be included in the January 2023 Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module AUR 14-39 14 day rule. Further, cultures obtained while the patient was at another healthcare facility should not be included in the 14 day calculations. A. Eligible organisms include: Facilities and vendors should refer to the AR Option Pathogen Roll-up Workbook found in the Antimicrobial Resistance Toolkit f or eligible organisms for AR Option reporting and the complete lis t of their associated SNOMED codes. All organisms in the Workbook are eligible for reporting. Refer to the AR Option Pathogen Roll -up Reference Guide, also found in the AR Toolkit, for guidance using the workbook and determining which SNOMED codes are accepted into NHSN. B. Specimen Sources Eligible specimen source groups include blood, CSF, urine, and lower respiratory. Facilities and vendors should refer to the Information Data Model (IDM) found in the Antimicrobial Resistance Toolkit fo r the complete list of eligible specimen sources and their associated SNOMED codes. Facilities should only report those SNOMED codes listed in the AR Specimen Source value set on the Specimen Source tab in January 2023 Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module AUR 14-40 the IDM. Do not include SNOMED children specimen types unless specifically listed. Wound specimens are not eligible for reporting into the AR Option. 1. Eligible invasive specimen sources include cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood specimens. ( Table 1) Note: Report bl ood o r CSF cultures growing the same eligible specific organism (genus and species or genus only if the species has not been identified) only if the patient had no positive blood or CSF culture result with that specific organism (genus and species or genus only if the species has not been identified) within the last 14 days, even across calendar months. 2. Eligibl e non -invasive specimen sources include lower respiratory (for example, sputum, endotracheal, bronchoalveolar lavage) and urine specimens. Table 1: Example of 14 day rule for a specific organism from a single patient in an inpatient location Date Lab Result Reported to NHSN? Justification January 1 Staphylococcus aureus isolated from blood culture Yes Patient's first blood culture of inpatient admission; Staphylococcus aureus is isolated; facility reports AR Event into NHSN. January 4 Staphylococcus aureus isolated from blood culture No It has been less than 14 days since the last positive culture (January 1) from the patient isolating Staphylococcus aureus. January 16 Staphylococcus aureus isolated from CSF culture No It has been less than 14 days since the last positive culture (January 4) from the patient isolating Staphylococcus aureus . January 31 Staphylococcus aureus isolated from blood culture Yes It has more than 14 days since the last positive culture (January 16) from the patient isolating Staphylococcus aureus ; facility reports AR Event into NHSN. The facility should evaluate all isolate test results using either the algorithm in Figure 1 (Invasive specimens) or Figure 2 (Non-invasive specimens) to determine reportable AR events for each ca lend ar month. For eligible invasive specimens, there should be 14 days with no positive culture result from the labo r atory for the patient and specific organism before the facility enters another invasive source AR Event into NHSN for the patient and specific organism ( Figure 1 ). Based on the 14 day rule, at a maximum, a patient would have no more than three invasive isolates per specific organism reported per month. January 2023 Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module AUR 14-41 For eligible non-invasive specimens, the facility should report all first non-invasive isolates (chronologically) per patient, per month, per organism as an AR Event ( Figure 2 ). C. Required Data Required data include data available from the LIS, EHRs, and administrative data systems. T he set of variables for each isolate consists of a variable to identify the NHSN facility, specimen -/patient -related data, and antimicrobial susceptibility data as outlined below. For additional information on each variable please see Appendix G . Facility identifier o Unique NHSN Facility ID (Object Identifier [OID] is used in the CDA) Specimen-/Patient-related data o Patient identifier o Date of birth o Gender o Whether the patient was admitted to the facility during the encounter ( True/False) o Date admitted to facility ( see details in Appendix G ) o Specimen collection date o Specimen source o Location code (mapped to CDC location codes) o Isolate identifier (unique isolate ID in the electronic laboratory report) o Organism ( Appendix F ) Antimicrobial protein 2a -agglutination (PBP2a) (required only if Staphylococcus aureus) o Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mec -gene (required only if Staphylococcus aureus ) o E-test sign o E-test value & unit of measure o Interpretation of E- test o Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) sign o MIC value & unit of measure o Interpretation of MIC test o Disk diffusion (Kirby -Bauer or KB) test sign o Disk diffusion (KB) test value & unit of measure o Interpretation of disk diffusion (KB) test o Final interpretation result Note: While many of these fields are required in the CDA report, facilities unable to elect ronically obtain the results of the individual laboratory tests (specifically, E-test, MIC, Disk diffusion [KB]) may still report AR Option data by using \"NA\" to indicate \"Not Tested\" for these specific tests as long as the final interpretation result can be provided for each antimicrobial tested. Facilities unable to electronically January 2023 Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module AUR 14-42 obtain the results of the PBP2a -agglutination and/or PCR mec -gene tests for Staphylococcus aureus may report \"Unknown\" for these specific tests. Facilities should not employ manual means of data collection to report AR Option data to NHSN. D. Reporting Guidelines Interpretation of test results (E-test, MIC test, Disk diffusion [KB] test) includes the following results: o S = Susceptible o S-DD = Susceptible -Dose Dependent o I = Intermediate o R = Resistant o NS = Non-Susceptible o NA = Not Tested Note: After upload into NHSN , Not Tested values appear as \"N\". o Specific to Gentamicin and Streptomycin results for Enterococcus testing: S = Susceptible/Synergistic R = Resistant/Not Synergistic Facilities should only report final or corrected susceptibility testing to NHSN. Do not report preliminary laboratory results for NHSN AR Option reporting. In circumstances where different breakpoints are required, rely on the specimen source to determine which susceptibility results to report. o If the specimen source is CSF, report the meningitis breakpoint susceptibility. o If the specimen source is blood, urine, or lower respiratory, report the non-meningitis breakpoint susceptibility. All organisms listed in the AR Option Pathogen Roll -up Workbook found in the Antimicrobial Resistance Toolkit are eligible for submission. Facilities/vendors should first perform the roll-up of organisms before applying subsequent reporting rules. E. R emoval of Same Day Duplicates Multiple isolates of the same organism from the same specimen may produce conflicting results. Facilities should only report one isolate to NHSN, retaining the unique nature of the test results. Facilities must follow the rules listed below to ensure removal of duplicate isolate reports. Duplicates are defined as same species or genus, when identification to species level is not provided, isolated from the same source type (specifically, invasive or non-invasive) from the same patient on the same day. For e xample, if a patient has a blood specimen and urine specimen collected on the same day and E.coli is isolated from both, because the specimens are from two different source types (invasive vs non -invasive), they are not considered duplicates. Select the isolate to report to NHSN based on these rules (see Figure 3 ): For invasive source isolate selection, select CSF isolates over blood isolates. For non -invasive source isolate selection, select lower respiratory isolates over ur ine isolates. Eliminate isolates on same day without susceptibility test results. Only report isolates with complete/final laboratory testing to NHSN. January 2023 Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module AUR 14-43 Do not merge test results across multiple isolates (specifically, don't summarize results across differen t isolates tested on same day). If two isolates from the same day have conflicting susceptibilities to the panel of antimicrobials tested, report the isolate with the most resistant final interpretation (NS > R > I > S-DD > S > NA). o If the lab validated susceptibility results of both isolates but did not provide a final interpretation, report the isolate with the higher amount of drug resistance based on the number of antimicrobials testing first \"NS\" , if equal amount of \"NS\" then move to the amount of \"R\", the n \"I\", then \"S -DD\" then \"S\" . For example, a facility isolated Candida albicans from two blood specimens collected from the same patient on the same calendar day and the lab validated susceptibility results from both isolates. The first isolate teste d \"R\" to three of the eight antimicrobials and the second isolate tested \"R\" to four of the eight antimicrobials. The facility should report the second isolate to NHSN because it showed the higher amount of resistance. o If two or more isolates have the same number of \"S\" and it cannot be determined which is most resistant, then report the isolate that was the first entered into the LIS. o Do not consider results from drugs that are outside of the NHSN- specified drug panels when determining which isolate to report. If the lab performs the same test on the same isolate but the two tests produce conflicting results, report the final interpretation provided by the lab. o If the lab did not provide a final interpretation, then report the most resistant interpretation (NS > R > I > S -DD > S > NA) for that specific antimicrobial. For example, if a facility performs two E -tests for the same drug on the same isolate and one produces \"Intermediate\" while the other produces \"Susceptible\", report \"Intermediate\" as the final interpretation for that specific drug susceptibility. If the lab performs specific antimicrobial tests on the same isolate that produce conflicting susceptibility interpretations, and the laborato ry did not provide a final summary interpretation, report the most resistant specific test interpretation as the final interpretation (NS > R > I > S -DD > S > NA) for that specific antimicrobial. o For example, if drug susceptibility results produced MIC = R esistant and E -Test = Intermediate but the lab did not provide a final interpretation, report \"Resistant\" as the final interpretation for that specific antimicrobial susceptibility. Denominator Data For each month, report combined denominator data for all inpatient locations within the facility (facility- wide inpatient [FacWideIN]): (See Appendix H f or details ) 1. Patient Days: Number of patients present in the facility at the same time on each day of the month, summed across all days in the month. 2. Admissions: Number of patients admitted to an inpatient location in the facility each month. a. A patient is counted as an admission when they arrive in an NHSN designated inpatient location regardless of patient status (for example, inpatient, observation). January 2023 Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module AUR 14-44 b. A patient admitted to an inpatient unit would be counted as an admission even if they were discharged that same calendar day. c. A patient transfer from an inpatient to an outpatient location then back to an inpatient location is counted as two separate admissions. d. Please note, the admissions definition used in the AUR Module is different than the definition used in the NHSN MDRO/CDI Module. Note: Neither the patient days nor admissions denominators should include the counts from outpatient locations (ED, pe diatric ED, and 24 -hour observation area). Report outpatient encounters for the three select outpatient locations: ED, Pediatric ED, and 24 -hour Observation Area: 1. Encounters: A visit to an eligible outpatient location counts as a single encounter. a. If the patient's stay in any eligible outpatient location continues into subsequent calendar day s, that patient should still be counted as 1 encounter. For example: i. If the patient arrives in the ED on Monday and remains in the ED until Wednesday, that patient s hould be counted as 1 encounter within the ED. b. If the patient transfers from one outpatient location to another within the same facility, that patient should be counted as 1 encounter for the first outpatient location and should not be counted as an encounter for the receiving location ( specifically, a patient should not contribute two encounters when transferring between outpatient locations in the same facility). For example: i. If the patient arrives in the ED on Monday then is transferred to the 24hr Observation Area on Tuesday, the patient should be counted only as 1 encounter within the ED and zero encounters within the 24hr Observation Area. c. If the patient is discharged, or leaves, then returns to that outpatient unit during the same calendar day, that patient should be counted as 2 encounters. For example: i. If the patient arrives in the ED at 07:00 on Monday, is discharged at 11:00 on Monday then returns to the ED at 18:00 on Monday, that patient counts as two separate encounters for the ED. d. If the patient transfers from outpatient to inpatient, then to outpatient, the second outpatient stay (assuming it's in an eligible location) would be considered a new encounter because there was time spent in an inpatient location . For example: i. If the patient a rrives in the ED on Monday, is admitted or transferred to the medical ICU on Monday then is transferred to the 24hr Observation Unit on Tuesday and admitted or transferred back to the medical ward on Tuesday, the patient would contribute 2 encounters to the ED location since there was time spent in an inpatient location (medical ward) in between the outpatient stays. e. If the patient's stay in the facility crosses calendar months, the patient will contribute an encounter to the f irst month the patient was in an outpatient location. For example: i. If patient is in outpatient location on Jan uary 31 and Feb ruary 1 then count as 1 encounter to January and zero to February. f. Please note, the encounters count will not be a direct match to the AU Option days present count for these location types. January 2023 Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module AUR 14-45 Minimizing Bias & Bypassing Suppression The hospital LIS is the ultimate source of antimicrobial susceptibility test results, but in some healthcare facilities not all susceptibility results are readily available in the LIS for reporting to NHSN. Concerted efforts are needed to obtain antimicrobial susceptibility data for the purposes of reporting to NHSN. Due to a practice referred to as selective reporting or cascade reporting , some antimicrobial susceptibility results might be withheld from clinical end users. This practice can serve to control costs or to prevent overuse of some antimicrobial agents, but it also can exert an adverse impact on the completeness of antimicrobial susceptibility results reporting to public health surveillance systems and infection control programs. 4 This can lead to significant biases in the calculation of cumulative antibiograms available for surveillance or infection control. Facilities should make every effort to s ubmit all antimicrobial susceptibility data that meet the NHSN protocol requirements, regardless of whether those data are suppressed from clinical end users. Data Analyses Facilities and groups can analyze all AR Option data reported to NHSN immediately after data upload . After generating analysis datasets within NHSN, users can view all reported data in the NHSN analysis reports. The data in NHSN can be visualized and analyzed in many ways. For example, descriptive analysis reports such as l ine lists and bar charts are available. In addition, measures of antimicrobial resistance are available in rate tables and antibiogram reports. Types of A R Option Analysis Reports Standardized Resistant Infection Ratio (SRIR ): The Standardized Resistant Infection Ratio (SRIR) is a metric developed by CDC to enable facilities to compare their rates of hospital -onset (HO) drug-resistant infection events to the national benchmarks . The SRIR adjusts for various facility level factors that contribute to AR risk within each facility. It compares the actual number of resistant infections to the number that would be predicted, given the standard population (specifically, the NHSN baseline), adjusting for several risk factors that have been found to be statistically significantly associated with differences in infection incidence. The S RIR is calculated by dividing observed resistant infections by predicted resistant infections . = The observed resistant infections are the number of hospital -onset AR Events that meet NHSN -specific resistance definitions (for CRE , MRSA, multi -drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa) . The predicted resistant infections are calculated using predictive models developed by CDC and applied to nationally aggregated 2 019 AR data reported to NHSN. Separate predi ctive models are developed for each specific resistant organism definition and specimen source (blood, urine, and lower respiratory) . The SRIR can be generated for 7 drug-resistant phenotypes from 3 specimen sources (blood , urine, and lower respiratory), for a total of 21 possible S RIRs ( see Appendix J ). The resistant organisms were January 2023 Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module AUR 14-46 determined by CDC with input from external adult, pediatric, and neonatal infectious disease physicians and pharmacists. The resistant organism categories are listed below (see Appendix I f or definitions) At present, SRIRs are available to facilities that have submitted at least one hospital -onset isolate of the specific organism in the given specimen source during the time period of interest. For example, a Vancomycin -resistant Enterococcus blood SRIR can be generated for the facilities that submitted at least one HO Enterococcus blood event in the given time period. A SRIR greater than 1.0 indicates that more resistant infections were observed than predicted. A SRIR less than 1.0 indicates that few er resistant infections were observed than predicted. An SRIR of 0 indicates a facility reported the organism of interest from the specimen source of interest during the correct time period, but the organism was not resistant to the drug(s) specified. For example, using the example of HO VRE in urine, if a hospital reports 10 hospital-onset Enterococcus isolates from urine during the time of interest, and all 10 are reported to be susceptible to vancomycin, the HO VRE SRIR would be 0 because there were 0 observed resistant infection events. A SRIR may be null when 1) there were no specimens collected from the specimen source of interest during the time period of interest, 2) there were no organisms of interest isolated from the specimen source during that time period, or 3) the minimum precision criteria (for the number of predicted AR infections) was not met. Using the example of HO VRE in urine, a facility would receive a null value for a SRIR if: 1) No urine specimen was collected during the time period of int erest or, 2) A urine specimen was collected during the correct time period but no HO Enterococcus was isolated or, 3) HO Enterococcus was isolated from urine during the correct time period but there were <0.2 HO VRE events predicted for the time period of interest SRIRs can be produced by quarter, half year, or year or cumulative time periods. Additional detail and guidance for the S RIRs will be available soon. Pathogen-specific Standardized Infection Ratio (pSIR): The Pathogen -Specific Standardized Infection Ratio (pSIR) is a metric developed by CDC to enable facilities to compare their rates of hospital -onset culture-positive infections of specific pathogen to a national benchmark. It compares the actual number of events ( pathogen s isolated) to the number predicted, given the standard population (specifically, the NHSN baseline), adjusting for several risk January 2023 Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module AUR 14-47 factors that have been found to be statistically significantly associated with differences in infection incidence. The pSIR is calculated by dividing observed infections of specific pathogens by predicted infections . = The observed infections are the number of hospital -onset events reported to NHSN. The predicted infections are calculated using predictive models developed by CDC and applied to nationally aggregated 2019 AR data reported to NHSN. Separate predictive models are developed for each pathogen and specimen source (blood, urine, and lower respiratory) . The pSIR can be generated for 4 pathogen s/pathogen groups and 3 specimen sources (blood , urine, and lower respiratory), for a total of 12 possible p SIRs (see Appendix J aureus Pseudomonas aeruginosa At present, pSIRs are available to facilities that have submitted at least one hospital -onset pathogen in the correct specimen source during the specified time period of interest. A pSIR greater than 1.0 indicates that more infections were observed than predicted. A pSIR less than 1.0 indicates that fewer infections were observed than predicted. A pSIR value of 0 indicates a facility reported at least one HO isolate from the specimen source of interest during the correct time period, but the pathogen of interest was not isolated. For example, for hospital -onset Enterococcus in urine, if a facility reported one or more HO isolates (any organism) from urine during the time period of interest, but no hospital -onset Enterococcus was isolated, the facility would receive a pSIR of 0 . A pSIR may be null when 1) there were no specimens collected from the specimen source of interest during the time period of interest, 2) there were no HO isolates (any pathogen ) reported from the specimen source of interest during the time period of interest or 3) the minimum precision criteria (for the number of predicted infections) was not met. Using the example of HO Enterococcus in urine, a facility would receive a null value for a pSIR if: 1) No urine specimen was collected during the time period of interest or, 2) One or more urine specimens were collected during the time period of interest, but no hospital -onset pathogen s were isolated from any of the urine samples or, 3) At least one HO pathogen was isolated from urine during the correct time period but there were <0.2 HO Enterococcus events predicted for that time period pSIR s can be produced by quarter, half year, or year or cumulative time periods. January 2023 Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module AUR 14-48 Additional detail and guidance for the pSIR s will be available soon. Facility- wide Antibiogram : The facility -wide antibiogram table displays the calculated percent susceptible ( see Table 2 ) for each organism-antimicrobial combination. Users can stratify the antibiogram table by specimen source, time period, and/or by specific antimicrobial or organism. Note: A facility must have tested and reported the antimicrobial susceptibility results for at least 30 isolates for a specific organism/antimicrobial combination in the given time period for results to appear in the NHSN antibiogram report. In a ddition to the facility -wide antibiogram, within the same report, NHSN creates a table displaying the calculated percent tested (see Appendix F ) for each organism-antimicrobial combination reported from all locations (inpatient and outpatient) to the AR Option.

All the facility's inpatient acute care locations should be included where denominators can be accurately collected. Required for FacWideIN January 2023 Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module AUR 14-67 Name Description of Field Level of Requirement Admiss ion Count Enter the total number of admissions for all facility inpatient locations combined for the month. A patient is counted as an admission when they arrive in an NHSN designated inpatient location regardless of patient status (for example, inpatient, observation). A patient admitted to an inpatient unit would be counted as an admission even if they were discharged that same calendar day. A patient transfer from an inpatient to an outpatient location then back to an inpatient location is counted as two separate admi ssions. Please note, the admissions definition used in the AUR Module is different than the definition used in the NHSN MDRO/CDI Module. Required for FacWideIN Encounters for outpatient locations Enter the total number of patient visits to the given outpatient location (specifically: ED, Pediatric ED, 24 -hour Observation Area). A visit to an eligible outpatient location counts as a single encounter. If the patient's stay in any eligible outpatient location continues into subsequent calendar days, that patient should still be counted as 1 encounter. For example: o If the patient arrives in the ED on Monday and remains in the ED until Wednesday, that patient should be counted as 1 encounter within the ED. If the patient transfers from one outpatient location to a nother within the same facility, that patient should be counted as 1 encounter for the first outpatient location and should not be counted as an encounter for the receiving location (specifically, a patient should not contribute two encounters when transferring between outpatient locations in the same facility). For example: o If the patient arrives in the ED on Monday then is t ransferred to the 24hr Observation Area on Tuesday, the patient should be counted only as 1 encounter within the ED and zero encounters within the 24hr Observation Area. If the patient is discharged, or leaves, then returns to that outpatient unit, that patient should be counted as 2 encounters , even when the moveme nts were during the same calendar day. For example: o If the patient arrives in the ED at 07:00 on Monday, is discharged at 11:00 on Monday then returns to the ED at Required for ED, Pediatric ED, and 24-hour Observation Area January 2023 Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module AUR 14-68 Name Description of Field Level of Requirement 18:00 on Monday, that patient counts as two separate encounters for the ED. If the patient transfers from outpatient to inpatient, then to outpa tient, the second outpatient stay (assuming it's in an eligible location) would be considered a new encounter because there was time spent in an inpatient location. For example: o If the patient arrives in the ED on Monday, is admitted or transferred to the medical ICU on Monday then is transferred to the 24hr Observation Unit on Tuesday and admitted or transferred back to the medical ward on Tuesday, the patient would contribute 2 encounters (the first in the ED and the second to the 24hr Observation Unit) since there was time spent in an inpatient location (medical ward) in between the outpatient stays. If the patient's stay in the facility crosses calendar months, the patient will contribute an encounter to the first month the patient was in an outpatient location. For example: o If patient is in outpatient location on January 31 and February 1 then count as 1 encounter to January and zero to February. Please note, the encounters count will not be a direct match to the AU Option days present count for these lo cation types. a Facilities interested in submitting data to NHSN via CDA must obtain a Facility OID (object identifier).

2 Instructions for Mapping Patient Care Locations in NHSN NHSN requires facilities map each patient care area in their facility to one or more locations as defined by NHSN in order to report surveillance data collected from these areas. This document functions as a decision-making tool when determining the appropriate CDC location for NHSN surveillance, as defined in the NHSN Manual. This process should be followed when adding any new unit to NHSN for surveillance and should be repeated for any unit when there is a significant change in patient mix ( for example, merging of units, taking on a new service). Step 1: Define the acuity level for the location Is this patient care area comprised of at least 80% of patients that are of the same acuity level? 1 Proceed to Step 2 and map to a location type of that acuity level using the NHSN 80% Rule for that specific type.2 Can this patient care area be split into 2 or more locations in NHSN for the purposes of surveillance - also referred to as \"virtual locations\"? 3 Proceed to Step 2 and create locations in NHSN for each of the acuity levels, using the NHSN 80% Rule.2 Map t o a CDC Mixed Acuity location.4 YES NO YES NO List of Acuity Levels : Adult Critical Care Units Mixed Acuity Units Pediatric Critical Care Units Operating Rooms Neonatal Critical Care Units Chronic Care Specialty Care Areas (SCA)/Oncology Long Term Acute Care Adult Wards Rehabilitation Pediatric Wards Outpatient (ACUTE) Locations Neonatal Wards Clinic (Nonacute) Settings Step Down Units January 2023 CDC Locations and Descriptions and Instructions for Mapping Patient Care Locations 15 - 3 Step 2: Define the type of service for the location Is this patient care area a general medical, surgical, or medical/surgical unit? Or is it comprised of patients from a specific service type ( for example, burn, cardiac)? 1 If general medical or surgical, are more than 60% of patients either medical or surgical? If the unit is comprised of patients of a specific service type, does this unit meet the NHSN 80% Rule for locations2? Create a location in NHSN that is mapped to the majority type (specifically, medical or surgical) The mix of patients should then be a 50/50 to 60/40 mix of medical and surgical patients Create a location in NHSN that is mapped to a combined medical/surgical CDC location General Specific Create a location in NHSN that is mapped to that CDC location type Can this single unit be split into 2 or more units in NHSN for the purposes of surveillance - also referred to as \"virtual locations3\"? YES NO Create locations in NHSN for each of these specific service virtual locations Is the mix of patients in this unit approximately a 50/50 to 60/40 mix of combined medical and surgical? Create a location in NHSN that is mapped to a combined medical/surgical unit YES YES NO NO Create a location in NHSN that is mapped to the location of the majority type (specifically, greater than 60%) - either medical or surgical January 2023 CDC Locations and Descriptions and Instructions for Mapping Patient Care Locations 15 - 4 Please see the CDC Location descriptions for definitions of each CDC Location used for NHSN surveillance in this chapter. 1. Patient mix: When determining the appropriate CDC Location mapping for a unit, facilities should review the patient mix in that unit for the last full calendar year using acuity billing data (if available ). The acuity billing data is considered the most accurate depiction of the patient's illness and reason for being admitted to a particular unit. Admission/transfer diagnosis can also be used to determine location mapping if billing data is not available. Facilities s hould use 1 years' worth of data to make this determination. If a full year of data is not available, a shorter period of at least 3 months is acceptable, but every effort should be made to collect and analyze greater periods of time in the future. If billing acuity data is not available, facilities should review patient mix based on the data they have available for that unit. 2. NHSN 80% Rule : Each patient care area in a facility is \"mapped\" to one CDC Locations. The specific CDC Location code is determined by the type of patients cared for in that specific area according to the 80% Rule. I f 80% of patients are of a certain type ( for example, pediatric patients with orthopedic problems) , the area is designated as that specific type of location (in this case, an Inpatient Pediatric Orthopedic Ward). 3. Virtual locations : Virtual locations are created in NHSN when a facility is unable to meet the 80% rule for location designation in a singl e physical unit but would like to report their NHSN surveillance data for each of the major, specific patient types in that unit. The use of virtual locations is recommended for those physical units that are geographically split by patient service or those in which beds are designated by service. For example, a facility has an ICU - called 5 West - comprised of approximately 50% neurology patients and 50% neurosurgery patients. Additionally, the neurology patients are housed in beds 1 thru 10 and the neurosurgery patients are housed in beds 11 thru 20. Rather than map as a medical/surgical critical care unit, the facility decides to create 2 new locations in NHSN: 5WEST_N: Neurologic Critical Care (10 beds) 5WEST_NS: Neurosurgical Critical Care (10 beds) This facility will collect and enter data for 5WEST_N and 5WEST_NS separately. The facility will also be able to obtain rates and standardized infection ratios (SIRs) for each location separately. Note that the data collected and reported for each virtual location will be limited to the designated 10 beds assigned (specifically, overflow from 5WEST_N into 5WEST_NS will be counted with 5WEST_NS ). For those facilities that use an electronic source for collecting data, discuss compatibility of virtual locatio ns in NHSN with your facility's EHR contact prior to reporting data for these locations. 4. Mixed Acuity Unit : This location is intended for those units comprised of patients with varying levels of acuity. NOTE: Mapping a location in NHSN to the CDC \"Mixed Acuity\" designation may have implications on data that your facility reports for CMS Programs and/or your state's reporting mandate(s). Although a Mixed Acuity location may have ICU beds and ICU patients, it is not considered an ICU location type for the purposes of NHSN reporting and therefore is not included in any ICU-specific reporting requirements. Mixed Acuity units are also excluded from ward -specific reporting requirements. For information about how this location designation may impact your facility's compliance with your state mandate (if applicable), please contact your state HAI coordinator: www.cdc.g ov/HAI/state -based/index.html. January 2023 CDC Locations and Descriptions and Instructions for Mapping Patient Care Locations 15 - 5 5. Overflow Unit: This location is intended for area s previously not used for patient care which has been repurposed to care for critically or non -critically ill or injured patients . Examples Example 1: An ICU that is 85% Burn patients, 15% Trauma CDC Location: Burn Critical Care (IN:ACUTE:CC:B) Why? Meets 80% rule for critical care acuity level and 80% rule for specific service (burn) Example 2: An ICU that is 55% medical and 45% surgical CDC Location: Medical/Surgical Critical Care (IN:ACUTE:CC:MS) Why? Meets 80% rule for critical care acuity level and does not meet the 6 0% rule for designation as either medical or surgical service level alone, therefore, use combined medical/surgical designation Exampl e 3: A unit that is comprised of 60% medical inpatients and 40% general observation patients CDC Location: Medical Ward (IN:ACUTE:WARD:M) Why? This is a special scenario due to the mix of inpatients and outpatients in this unit. A location where at least 51% of the patients have been formally admitted to the facility should be mapped as in inpatient unit, rather than an outpatient observation unit. The 60% rule for general service and the 80% rule for specific service still apply when deciding on the speci fic type of inpatient location to use; this location met the 60% rule for medical service. All patients housed in this unit should be included in the surveillance efforts for this location regardless of patient status. Example 4: An ICU that is 40% Neuros urgical, 40% Surgical, and 20% Medical Option 1 - Single CDC Location: Surgical Critical Care Why? Meets 80% rule for critical care acuity level and does not meet the 80% rule for a specific service level alone, but when surgical patients are combined, that total does equal 80%. Option 2 - Multiple CDC Virtual Locations: Neurosurgical Critical Care and Surgical Critical Care, with the medical patients reported with the Surgical Critical Care location since the general surgical designation is the least spe cific of the two Why? By splitting this unit into 2 virtual locations, each meets the 80% rule for critical care acuity level, and one meets the 80% rule for designation as Neurosurgical Critical Care, while the other meets the 60% rule as general surgical service (when combining surgical and medical patients). This option requires denominator data be separated by virtual location. Example 5: A unit that is comprised of 60% Medical ICU and 40% Step Down patients Option 1 - Multiple CDC Virtual Locations: Medical Critical Care and Step Down Unit January 2023 CDC Locations and Descriptions and Instructions for Mapping Patient Care Locations 15 - 6 Why? By splitting this unit into 2 virtual locations, each meets the 80% rule for the appropriate acuity level, and each meets the 80% rule for type of service. Preferred mapping if denominator data can be captured separately for each virtual location. Option 2 - Single CDC Location: Mixed Acuity Unit Why? This location is not comprised of at least 80% of the patients of the same acuity level and therefore meets the single location definition of a mixed acuity unit. Note that this location is not considered an ICU location type for the purposes of NHSN reporting and therefore, would not be included in any ICU-specific reporting requirements. Example 6: A pediatric ward that is comprised of 70% neurosurgical patients and 30% orthopedic patients Option 1 - Single CDC Location: Pediatric Surgical Ward Why? Meets 80% rule for ward -level acuity and does not meet the 80% rule for a specific service level alone and meets the 60% rule for general surgical service. Option 2 - Multiple CDC Virtual Locations: Pediatric Neurosurgical Ward and Pediatric Orthopedic Ward Why? By splitting this unit into 2 virtual locations, each meets the 80% rule for the appropriate acuity level, and each meets the 80% rule for type of service. Surge and/or overflow units, whether newly opened or repurposed from a previously mapped location, should follow the above guidance and be included in facility mapping. Examples of surge/overflow mapping can be found here: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/covid19/location -mapping-508.pdf . January 2023 CDC Locations and Descriptions and Instructions for Mapping Patient Care Locations 15 - 7 Appendix: Creation and Management of Locations in NHSN Create New Locations: If there are any operational locations in your hospital that are not already set-up in NHSN, you will need to create these locations for the purposes of NHSN surveillance and reporting. Locations can be set up by following these steps: 1. Go to Facility > L ocations. 2. On the Locations screen, enter a location code (\"Your Code\") and location label (\"Your Label\"). 3. Select a CDC Location Description from the drop-down menu. NOTE: When selecting a CDC Location Description, your location must meet the 80% Rule in o rder to be assigned as that CDC Location Description. 4. Make sure the Status is set to \"Active\" and then enter the number of beds that are set up and staffed in that location. 5. Once all information for this new location is entered, click 'Add'. Manage Exist ing Locations: Facilities should ensure locations with an \"Active\" status in NHSN are those that are operational units within the facility. The number of beds indicated for each location should also be checked for accuracy and, if necessary, updated to reflect the current number of beds set up and staffed. Location information can be updated by following these steps: 1. Go to Facility > Locations. 2. On the Locations screen, click 'Find'. 3. Review the information that appears in the Location Table at the bottom of the screen. Review the Status of each location, as well as Bed size. 4. If a location's information needs to be updated, click the location code under the \"Your Code\" column; the location's information will auto -fill in the fields above the Location Table. 5. Make any modifications to the Status and/or Bed size, then click 'Save'. Manage Physically Moved Locations Units within a facility may physically move to another area of the same facility and be given a different name. If the staff are moving with these l ocations, and the type of patients remains the same ( specifically, the only difference is the geographical location and/or Bed size), then it's recommended to change \"Your Code\" and \"Your Label\" (and Bed size, if appropriate) on the existing location recor ds. These fields can be updated by following the instructions for \"Manage Existing Locations\" above. Updating the value of \"Your Code\" will also update all previously-entered records for these locations, allowing for continuous analysis and reporting. Inaccurate CDC Location Description Please note that the CDC Location Description cannot be edited after a location is mapped in NHSN. If you believe that the CDC Location Description assigned to your existing location is incorrect, there are additional steps you will need to follow, depending on the scenario: Scenario 1: The patient population in this unit has changed such that the current CDC Location Description, using the 80% rule, is inaccurate. January 2023 CDC Locations and Descriptions and Instructions for Mapping Patient Care Locations 15 - 8 Solution: Due to patient population change, a new location is created in NHSN and mapped t o a CDC Location Description that most accurately reflects the type of patients receiving care in that location, using the 80% rule. The existing location is placed into \"Inactive\" status. When creating a new location different \"Your Code\" and \"Your Label\" value must be used . Note : data reported from inactive locations can continue to be analyzed within NHSN for the months during which they appear in the Monthly Reporting Plans. Additionally, note inactive locations will not be linked to new, active locations.

January 202 3 16 - 1 General Key Terms Definitions specific to individual protocols are found in the respective protocol. Term Definition Active Surveillance Culture/Testing (ASC/AST) For purposes of NHSN surveillance, Active Surveillance Culture/Testing (ASC/AST) refers to testing that is intended to identify the presence/carriage of microorganisms for the purpose of instituting or discontinuing isolation precautions (for example, nasa l swab for MRSA, rectal swab for VRE), or monitoring for eradication of a carrier state. ASC/AST does NOT include identification of microorganisms with cultures or tests performed for diagnosis and treatment purposes (for example, specimens collected from sterile body sites including blood specimens). Also, see Surveillance cultures . Apnea See Vital Signs . Aseptically obtained Specimen obtained in a manner to prevent introduction of organisms from the surrounding tissues. Birthweight Weight of the infant at the time of birth. Birthweight should not be changed as the infant gains weight. The NHSN birthweight categories are as follows: A = 750 = 751 = E = >2500 g. Calendar Day For NHSN purposes, a calendar day is midnight (00 :00) to 11 :59pm . CDC location A CDC-defined designation given to a patient care area housing patents who have similar disease conditions or who are receiving care for similar medical or surgical specialties. Each facility location that is monitored is \"mapped\" to one CDC Location. The specific CDC Location code is determined by the type of patients cared for in that area according to the 80% Rule. The 80% Rule requires that 80% of the patients in a location are of a certain acuity level and service type (for example, if 80% of the pati ents in a ward level area are pediatric patients receiving orthopedic care, this area should be designated as an Inpatient Pediatric Orthopedic Ward). When mapping facility locations to CDC locations, use the following points: Acuity billing data (if avai lable) is the most reliable and objective method of determining appropriate location mapping. Admission/transfer diagnosis can also be used to determine location mapping if billing data is not available. When possible, facilities should use one year's wo rth of data to make this determination. If that is not available, a shorter period of at least 3 months is acceptable, but every effort should be made to collect and analyze greater periods of time consistently in the future, using the same method. January 2023 Key Terms 16 - 2 Term Definition Also, see Virtual Location in the Locations and Descriptions chapter . For detailed instructions on how to map locations, see \"Instructions for Mapping Patient Care Locati ons in NHSN\" in the Locations and Descriptions chapter . Clinical correlation Physician documentation of antimicrobial treatment for site-specific infection related to equivocal findings (not clearly identified) of infection on imaging test. For example, when applying intraabdominal infection (IAB) criterion \"3b\", the finding of 'fluid collection seen in the lower abdominal cavity' on an imaging test , may or may not represent an infection. This finding is not clearly identified as an infection and should be confirmed with clinical evidence that an infection is present. In the case of IAB criterion \"3b\", the clinical evidence that is required, is physi cian documentation of antimicrobial therapy for treating the intraabdominal infection. Date of event (DOE) The date the first element used to meet an NHSN site -specific infection criterion occurs for the first time within the seven-day infection window period or SSI surveillance period. Synonyms: infection date, date of infection, event date. In the case of a process measure, the date the process or intervention was performed (for example, the day a central line was inserted is the date of CLIP event). This definition does not apply to LabID Event, PedVAE , or VAE. See Date of event for VAE, SSI, LabID Event , and PedVAE in respective protocols. Days present The denominator days present is only used in the AUR Module. See Antimicrobial Use and Resistance (AUR) Module . Device -associated infection An infection meeting the HAI definition is considered a device-associated HAI (for example, associated with the use of a ventilator, central line, or indwelling urinary catheter) if the device was in place for >2 calendar days on the date of event and was also in place on the date of event or the day before the event . If the device was in place for >2 calendar days and then removed, the date of event must be the day of device discontinuation or the next day to be device associated. For a patient who has a central line in place on hospital admission, day of first inpatient access is considered De vice Day 1. For a patient who has a ventilator or urinary catheter in place prior to inpatient admission, the device day count that determines device -association begins with the admission date to the first inpatient location. Device days A count of the number of patients with a specific device in a patient care location during a time period. This count can be determined electronically or manually by a daily count or weekly sampling. See Denominator Data section within individual protocols. Died The pati ent died during the current facility admission. January 2023 Key Terms 16 - 3 Term Definition Event contributed to death The event either directly caused death or exacerbated an existing disease condition that then led to death as evidenced by available documentation (for example, death/discharge note, autopsy report, etc.). Event date See Date of event . Equivocal imaging Findings from medical imaging studies that do not conclusively identify an infection or infectious process. Imaging findings such as these require additional conclusive clinical evidence that an infection is present, such as physician documentation of antimicrobial therapy for treating the infection or infectious process. Example of definitive imaging: abscess visualize d in the right lower quadrant. Example of equivocal imaging: fluid collection visualized in the right lower quadrant. Fever See Vital signs . Gross anatomical exam Evidence of infection elicited or visualized on physical examination or observed during an invasive procedure. This includes findings elicited on physical examination of a patient during admission or subsequent assessments of the patient and may include findings noted during a medical/invasive procedur e dependent upon the location of the infection as well as the NHSN infection criterion. Examples: An intraabdominal abscess will require an invasive procedure to actually visualize the abscess. Visualization of pus or purulent drainage (includes from a drain). SSI only: Abdominal pain or tenderness post Cesarean section (CSEC) or hysterectomy (HYST or VHYS ) is sufficient gross anatomic evidence of infection without an invasive procedure to meet general Organ Space SSI criterion \"c\" when OREP or EMET is met . Allowing the documentation of abdominal pain or tenderness as gross anatomic evidence of infection to meet general Organ/ Space SSI criterion \"c\" enables the user to report an SSI-OREP or SSI -EMET. Abdominal pain or tenderness cannot be applied as 'ot her evidence of infection on gross anatomic exam' to meet Deep Incisional SSI criterion 'c' or to meet any Chapter 17 site -specific criterion (for example, OREP '2') . Note : Imaging test evidence of infection cannot be applied to meet gross anatomic evidenc e of infection. Imaging test evidence has distinct findings in the HAI definitions. (For example, IAB \"3b\"). January 2023 Key Terms 16 - 4 Term Definition Healthcare -associated infection (HAI) An infection is considered a HAI if the date of event of the NHSN site -specific infection criterion occurs on or after the 3rd calendar day of admission to an inpatient location where day of admission to an inpatient location is calendar day 1. See Identifying HAIs chap ter. Note: Rules for HAI do not apply to SSI, VAE, PedVAE, or LabID Events. Hypotension See Vital signs. Infant A patient who is 1 year ( 365 days) of age. Infection date See Date of Event . Infection window period (IWP) The 7 days during which all site-specific infection criteria must be met. It includes the date the first positive diagnostic test that is used as an element of the site - specific inf ection criterion was obtained, the 3 calendar days before, and the 3 calendar days after. Note: Rules for IWP do not apply to SSI, VAE, PedVAE, or LabID Events. Inpatient location See Location . In-plan surveillance Facility has indicated in their NHSN Monthly Reporting Plan that the NHSN surveillance protocol(s) will be used, in its entirety for the full month, for that particular HAI , SSI, VAE, PedVAE, or LabID event s type. Only in -plan data are submit ted to CMS in accordance with CMS's Quality Reporting Programs and are included in NHSN annual reports or other NHSN publications. Intensive care unit (ICU) Also known as a Critical Care Unit, the ICU is a nursing care area that provides intensive observa tion, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for adults and/or children who are critically ill. An ICU excludes nursing areas that provide step- down, intermediate care or telemetry only. The type of ICU is determined by the type of patients cared for in tha t unit according to the 80% Rule -which means 80% of the patients in a location are of a certain type. For example, if 80% of the patients in an area are patients receiving critical care for trauma, this area should be designated as an Inpatient Trauma Cri tical Care Unit. When an ICU houses roughly equal populations of medical and surgical patients (a 50/50 to 60/40 mix), it is called a medical/surgical ICU. Location The patient care area to which a patient is assigned while receiving care in the healthcar e facility. Note: Only mapped inpatient locations where denominator data are collected can be used for attribution and reporting infection events via the Device-associated Module. Operating rooms (including cardiac catheter labs, C -section rooms, and interventional radiolo gy), emergency departments and outpatient locations are January 2023 Key Terms 16 - 5 Term Definition not valid locations for attribution of device -associated infection events (see Location of Attribution). Also, see CDC Location . Location of attribution (LOA) The inpatient location where the patient was assigned on the date of event (see also Date of Event and Transfer Rule terms). Non -bedded patient locations, (for example, PACU or OR) are not eligible for assignment of location of attribution for HAI events. Location of attribution must be a location where denominator data can be collected. See individual HAI protocol(s) for additional details. Neonate A patient who is 30 days of age. Non-Bedded Patient Location A patient care location that does not house patients overnight; therefore, for NHSN reporting purposes a device associated HAI event cannot be attributed to the location since there are no patient or device day counts collected. Note: There are non -bedded locations that are considered inpatient non -bedded locations such as the OR, inpatient dialysis, intervention al radiology or, the cardiac catheterization lab. Non-culture based microbiologic testing Identification of microorganisms using a method of testing other than a culture. Culture based testing require inoculation of a specimen to culture media, incubation and observation for actual growth of microorganisms. Depending on the organism identified, culturing can take several day s to weeks for a final report. In contrast, non -culture based testing methods generally provide faster results, which can assist with early diagnosis and tailoring of antimicrobial therapy. Examples of non -culture based testing include but are not limited to PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). With the exception of Active Surveillance Culture/Testing (ASC/AST), any test methodology (culture or non -culture based) that provides a final laboratory report in the medic al record and identifies an organism, is eligible for use in meeting an NHSN infection definition. Off-plan surveillance Facility has not indicated in their NHSN Monthly Reporting Plan that the NHSN surveillance protocol(s) will be used, in its entirety, for that particular HAI event type. Off -plan data are not submitted to CMS in accordance with CMS's Quality Reporting Programs and are no t included in NHSN annual reports or other NHSN publications. Patient days A count of the number of patients in a patient care location during a defined time period. This count can be determined electronically or manually by a daily count or, depending on the location type, weekly sampling. See Denominator Data section within individual protocols. January 2023 Key Terms 16 - 6 Term Definition Present on admission (POA) An infection meeting an NHSN site-specific infection criterion with a date of event that occurs on the day of admission to an inpatient location (calendar day 1), the 2 days before admission, or the calendar day after admission (POA time period). See Identifying HAIs i n NHSN. Note: Rules for POA do not apply to SSI, VAE, PedVAE, or LabID Events. Physician For purpose of NHSN surveillance, the term physician includes physician or physician's designee, specifically, nurse practitioner or physician's assistant. Repeat infection timeframe (RIT) The 14 -day timeframe during which no new infections of the same type are reported. Rules for applying RIT: Applies to both POA and HAI event determinations. The date of event is Day 1 of the 14 -day RIT. If criteria for the same type of infection are met and the date of event is within the 14 -day RIT, a new event is not identified or reported. Additional pathogens recovered during the RIT from the same type of infection are added to the event and the original date of event is maintained a s is the original 14 -day RIT. Device association determination and location of attribution are not amended. Do not apply to SSI, VAE, PedVAE, or LabID Events. See Identifying HAIs in NHSN Secondary BSI attribution period (SBAP) The period in which a blood specimen must be collected for a secondary bloodstream infection to be attributed to a primary site infection. This period includes the Infection Window Period (IWP) combined with the Repeat Infection Timeframe (RIT) . It is 14 -17 days in length depending upon the date of event. Notes: Secondary BSI Attributi on Period does not apply to , PedVAE, or LabID Events. The Secondary BSI Attribution Period for SSI is a 17 -day period that includes the date of event of the SSI, 3 days prior to the date of event, and 13 days after the SSI date of event. Standardized Infection Ratio (SIR) Summary measure used to track HAIs over time. It compares the number of reported HAIs to the number of predicted HAIs, based on NHSN baseline data. The SIR adjusts for several factors that may impact the risk of acquiring an HAI. See the SIR Guide for more information. Surveillance cultures Those cultures reported as part of a facility's infection prevention and control surveillance are not used in patient diagnosis and treatment. Surveillance cultures include but are not limited to stool cultures for vancomycin -resistant Enterococci January 2023 Key Terms 16 - 7 Term Definition (VRE) and/or nasal swabs for methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) surveillance. These cult ures are also called active surveillance cultures or testing (ASC/AST). Note: Positive cultures collected from sterile body sites including blood specimens are not surveillance cultures and are eligible for use in meeting NHSN HAI, LabID, VAE, and SSI eve nt criteria. Also, see Active Surveillance Culture/Testing (ASC/AST). Surveillance Period for SSI The timeframe following an NHSN operative procedure for monitoring and identifying an SSI event. The surveillance period is determined by the NHSN operative procedure category (for example, COLO has a 30 -day SSI surveillance period and KPRO has a 90 -day SS I surveillance period, see Table 2 within the SSI protocol ). Superficial incisional SSIs are only followed for a 30 -day period for all procedure types. Secondary incisional SSIs are only followed for a 30 -day period regardless of the surveillance period for the primary site. Teaching hospital NHSN defines three types of teaching hospitals: Major: Facility has a program for medical students and post -graduate medical training. Graduate: Facility has a program for post -graduate medical training (residency and/or fellowships). Undergraduate: Facility has a program f or medical / nursing students only. Temperature See Vital signs . Temperature instability See Vital signs . Transfer rule The process of assigning location of attribution when the date of event is on the date of transfer or discharge, or the next day; the infection is attributed to the transferring/discharging location. If the patient was housed in multiple locations within t he transfer rule time frame, attribute the infection to the first location in which the patient was housed the day before the infection's date of event. Note: Transfer rule for HAI do not apply to LabID Events Vital signs Clinical measurements used to assess a patient's essential body functions. If a specific vital sign parameter is not stated in a CDC/NHSN HAI definition or criterion (for example, hypotension and temperature instability) the facility should use the vital s ign parameter(s) as stated in its policies and procedures for clinical practices. Notes: January 2023 Key Terms 16 - 8 Term Definition For fever, NHSN does have a stated value; the facility should use the temperature documented in the patient's medical record. There is no conversion of temperature based on route of collection. For apnea in ventilated patients < 1 year of age, apnea cannot be determined by changes /adjustments i n ventilator settings or by worsening oxygenation. January 202 3 17 - 1 CDC/NHSN Surveillance Definitions for Specific Types of Infections Introduction This chapter contains the CDC/NHSN surveillance definitions and criteria for all specific types of infections. This chapter also provides additional required criteria for the specific infection types that constitute organ space surgical site infections (Re fer to Chapter 9 Appendix for specific event types available for organ space SSI attribution for each NHSN operative procedure category) . Comments and reporting instructions that follow the site -specific criteria provide further explanation and are integral to the correct application of the criteria. Refer to Chapter 2 (Identifying HAIs in NHSN) for specific guidance for making HAI determinations. Infection criteria contained in this chapter may be necessary for determining whether a positive blood specimen represents a primary bloodstream infection (BSI) or is secondary to a different type of infection (see Appendix B Secondary Bloodstream Infection (BSI) Guide). A BSI that is identified as secondary to another site of infection must meet one of the infection crite ria detailed in this chapter or an eligible infection criterion in the Patient Safety manual and meet other requirements. Secondary BSIs are not reported as Laboratory Confirmed Bloodstream Infections in NHSN, nor can they be associated with the use of a central line. NOTES: See individual protocol chapters for infection criteria for urinary tract infections (UTI) , bloodstream infections (BSI), pneumonia (PNEU) , ventilator -associated infections , and surgical site infections (SSI) . For NHSN reporting purposes, the term \"organism(s)\" in this chapter includes viruses. Organisms belonging to the following genera cannot be used to meet are typically causes of community -associated infections and ar e rarely known to cause healthcare -associated infections, and therefore are excluded. Antibiograms of the blood and isolates from potential primary sites of infection do not have to match for purposes of determining the source of BSIs (see \"matching organisms\" below). A matching organism is defined as one of the following: 1. If genus and species are identified in both specimens, they must be the same. January 2023 Surveillance Definitions 17 - 2 a. Example: An intraabdominal specimen is used as an element to meet IAB definition and is growing Enterobacter cloacae. A blood specimen with a collection date in the IAB secondary BSI attribution period is reported to be growing Enterobacter cloacae. These are consi dered matching organisms. b. Example: An intraabdominal specimen is used as an element to meet IAB definition and is growing Enterococcus faecium. A blood specimen with a collection date in the IAB secondary BSI attribution period is reported to be growing E nterococcus faecalis. These are NOT considered matching organisms as the species are different. 2. If the organism is less definitively identified in one specimen than the other, the lesser identified organism must be identified to at least the genus level and at that level the organisms must be the same. a. Example: A surgical wound growing Pseudomo nas species is used to meet deep incisional SSI criteria and a blood specimen growing Pseudomonas aeruginosa is collected in the SSI secondary BSI attribution period. The organisms are considered matching at the genus level and therefore the BSI is seconda ry to the SSI. b. Example: PCR identifying Enterococcus faecalis in CSF meets the MEN definition. A subsequent blood culture collected in the MEN secondary BSI attribution period is identified as Enterococcus species. The organisms are considered to be matching and therefore the BSI is secondary to MEN. 3. There are two exceptions to the definition: a. Infections meeting LCBI 2 criteria with Staphylococcus or Streptococcus: Example -(Staphylococcus): A patient has a fever and a previous chest tube site is reddened, swollen and a culture is collected from the soft tissue. The chest tube site culture is reported positive for Staphylococcus species. SST/ST definition is met. The next day 2 blood culture sets are collected. The blood cultures are both positive for coagulase- negative Staphylococcus. The organisms are NOT considered matching, because Staphylococcus species could represent a co agulase -negative or a coagulase -positive Staphylococcus . Therefore, the BSI would not be considered secondary to SST/ST. Example -(Streptococcus): A patient has a fever and a previous chest tube is reddened swollen and a culture is collected from the sof t tissue. The chest tube site culture is reported positive for Streptococcus species. SST/ST definition is met. The next day, 2 blood culture sets are collected. The blood cultures are both positive for Streptococcus , viridans group. The organisms are NOT considered matching, because Streptococcus species could represent a Streptococcus , viridans group or non - Streptococcus , viridans group. Therefore, the BSI would not be considered secondary to SST/ST. January 2023 Surveillance Definitions 17 - 3 b. In cases where an organism is identified only as \"yeast\" or \"yeast not otherwise specified\", the organism can be considered a match to other yeasts, when collected during the required timeframe, whether more fully identified or not. Example: A culture of tissue from the ulcer margin of a decubiti repo rted positive for yeast is used as an element to meet DECU definition. A blood specimen collected in the secondary BSI attribution period of the DECU is reported as Candida albicans . In this example, the two organisms are considered matching organisms as t he organisms are complementary (specifically, Candida is a type of yeast) and because yeasts isolated from non-sterile sites are commonly not identified to the genus or genus and species level. NOTE: This exception is limited to yeast . It does not apply t o identification of organisms as Gram positive cocci, Gram negative rods, etc. Example : A culture of tissue from ulcer margin of a decubiti reported positive for Gram negative rod is used as an element to meet DECU definition. A blood specimen collected in the secondary BSI attribution period of the DECU is reported as E. coli. In this example the two organisms are NOT considered matching organisms. Examples for Determining Matching Organisms (correct selection for NHSN reporting is bolded) Identification # 1 Identification # 2 Matching Organisms Yes or No Bacteroides aureus Coagulase -negative Staphylococcus Yes Staphylococcus species Coagulase -positive Streptococcus species Streptococcus Viridans Group No Yeast Candida species Yes Infection criteria used for NHSN healthcare -associated infection surveillance have been grouped into 14 major types with some further categorized into specific infection types.

It includes the date the first positive diagnostic test that is used as an element of the ENDO criterion was obtained, th e 10 calendars days before and the 10 calendar days after. The Infection Window Period is lengthened for this event to accommodate the extended diagnostic timeframe that is frequently required to reach a clinical determination of endocarditis. January 2023 Surveillance Definitions 17 - 12 The RIT for Endocarditis (ENDO) is extended to include the remainder of the patient's current admission. When meeting the Endocarditis (ENDO) definition, the secondary BSI attribution period includes the 21 -day infection window period and all subsequent days of the patient's current admission. o As a result of this lengthy secondary BSI attribution period, secondary BSI pathogen assignment for ENDO, is limited to organism(s) identified in blood specimen that match the organism(s) used to meet the ENDO definition. Example: If the ENDO definition was met using a site -specific specimen (for example, cardiac vegetation) or using a blood specimen with S. aureus as the identified organism, if a blood specimen collected during the ENDO secondary BSI attribution period is positive for S. aureus and E. coli, while the S. aureus can be assigned to the ENDO event, it cannot be assumed the E. coli can be assigned as a secondary BSI pathogen. The blood organism ( E. coli ) does not match the organism (S. aureus) used to meet the ENDO definition. If the blood specimen can be used to meet an ENDO definition criterion both organisms can be assigned. Otherwise , the E. coli will need to be investigated as a separate BSI and identified as a secondary BSI to another site -specific infect ion or determined to be a primary BSI.
