Becoming a mother is truly a blessing, but sometimes it can be very difficult and help can be hard to find. You can read every book, and website out there but there is nothing like hands on experience. During my maternity leave I focusing on learning more about the 4th trimester as well as starting my journey towards becoming an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant\u00ae (IBCLC\u00ae). I am happy to provide one-on-one breastfeeding support for mothers who need assistance. Naturopathic care can help mothers with the fluctuations in hormones, increased nutritional needs and stress management. I believe that this area of health is lacking and my experiences have made me passionate towards helping mothers make the best beginnings with their new babies. "}
