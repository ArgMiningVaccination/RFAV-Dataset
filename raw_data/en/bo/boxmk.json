When the body is dealing with chronic disease or low-level systemic inflammation, the immune system becomes dysregulated. It becomes imbalanced, and clogged with old white blood cells that aren't functioning well. In this situation, boosting the immune system\u2014a very popular trend these days- may not be the best strategy for restoring health. The use of \"immune boosting\" supplements to amplify certain aspects of an immune system that is already imbalanced and over-extended will only perpetuate the dysfunction. Rather than \"boosting\" the system, a better goal is to reset and rejuvenate it, and to replace worn-out immune cells with new ones to improve immune resilience. Fasting & Autophagy Fasting is a well-known method for stimulating the removal of old immune cells, producing new ones, and resetting the immune system. Fasting triggers the process called autophagy\u2014a break down and removal of damaged or dysfunctional white blood cells, including those misdirected against the body's own tissue (autoimmunity). Autophagy is particularly effective in destroying immunosenescent cells which are responsible for the alteration of immune functions due to aging. Intermittent fasting\u2014a meal schedule that alternates between normal eating patterns and brief but frequent full fasts (or restricted caloric intake)\u2014is an effective method for increasing the rate of autophagy. There are several different approaches to this, including alternate-day fasting and daily time-restricted eating. Regardless of the method chosen, the principle is similar: during periods of calorie restriction, the body removes senescent leukocytes and replace them with newly generated cells, which in turn reduces the overall amount of inflammation in the body. Eating again following a brief fast will stimulate stem cells to generate new leukocytes, a discovery for which Japanese cell biologist, Yoshinori Ohsumi, won the 2016 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. Within cells, a similar process of removal and replacement occurs with the mitochondria. At that level, fasting triggers a different type of autophagy called mitophagy, where old, damaged, dysfunctional mitochondria are broken down and removed, allowing the remaining mitochondria to function better. At the same time, mitophagy helps reduce the production of undesirable inflammatory cytokines from the cell. Intermittent fasting can take several forms, and it is a matter of personal preference which one works best for a given. Some people follow alternate-day fasting, a cycle of fasting on one day, and eating normally on the next. Others prefer the \"5:2 Diet,\" with five days per week of unrestricted eating and two non-consecutive days in which one eats only one meal, restricted to 500 to 700 calories. Still others prefer variations on time-restricted eating, where one limits one's eating to a relatively short daytime window, after fasting for at least 12 hours overnight. The fasting-mimicking diet, pioneered by Valter Longo, Ph.D., is a periodic, multi-day diet that restricts calories but is high in unsaturated fats. For many people, intermittent fasting is most easily accomplished by avoiding caloric consumption for at least 12 hours (preferably for 14 to 16 hours) after the evening meal. In my experience, aiming for a 14:10 eating pattern works well for many people. This means fasting for 14 hours between the evening meal and the first meal the next day. It's OK to drink unsweetened clear liquids such as water, tea, herbal tea, and coffee while fasting. During the 10-hour eating windows, I advise my patients to follow a health-oriented, plant-forward diet. Daily intermittent fasting like this enhances mitophagy and improves mitochondrial function. The mechanisms behind this are still being explored. We know, however, that the process involves several transcription factors that promote mitochondrial biogenesis. One example is nuclear factor 2 (NRF2), which regulates mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species. Fasting may enhance the production of NRF2 and improve the expression of antioxidant regulatory genes. A Role for Spermidine The value of intermittent fasting for immune rejuvenation through autophagy may be enhanced by supplementing with spermidine-a polyamine that induces autophagy through the TOR kinase pathway. Spermidine mimics the action of caloric restriction on the body. While not a substitute for intermittent fasting, spermidine supplements are particularly valuable for maintaining the rejuvenation effect during times when fasting periods must be shorter than usual. Improving Metabolism The benefits of intermittent fasting for rejuvenating the immune system and improving mitochondrial function are clear. In addition, it also reduces inflammation and improves insulin sensitivity. Many people find that intermittent fasting helps them lose weight by losing body fat, not muscle. The reality is, most Americans eat half or more of their daily calories by snacking on low-nutrient processed foods (aka junk food) after dinner. I strongly advise patients to avoid this damaging eating pattern by fasting for 14 hours or longer. In refraining from adding to their blood sugar during the fasting period, people can activate their bodies' ability to use existing blood sugar for energy, so there's little left over to be stored as fat. In some cases, the body will dip into its hepatic glycogen reserve overnight. Being overweight or obese strains the immune system by causing inflammation. Intermittent fasting helps with weight loss, which in turn helps relieve the stress on the immune system and makes rejuvenation even more effective. It's a virtuous circle that can greatly improve immune health. Critical Nutrients for Immunity A well-balanced diet that emphasizes plants, high-quality protein, and good fats, will lay the macronutrient foundation for strong immunity. But even with a good basic diet, many people run low on some essential minerals, particularly if they're battling a chronic illness or long-term inflammation. High levels of critical nutrients are essential for maintaining a healthy immune system and rejuvenating it through fasting. Good nutrition is also essential for efficiently producing ATP within the mitochondria. B vitamins, iron, magnesium, selenium, and zinc are all crucial for peak immunity. B Vitamins: The B vitamins thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin are essential, as is the closely related alpha-lipoic acid, along with amino acids such as carnitine, cysteine, and coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone or CoQ10). Iron is crucial for an effective immune system. Low serum iron is a common response to infection. It's the body's way of slowing the progress of the infection by keeping microbes from accessing the iron they need to reproduce and spread. But immune system cells need iron to support their metabolism. When iron is scarce, the mitochondria in immune cells can't generate enough energy. They become less effective at fighting infection and generating immune memory to fight future infections. Iron deficiency is one of the most common micronutrient deficiencies worldwide, particularly among pregnant women, the elderly, and hospitalized patients. Iron supplements can raise low serum iron levels and help maintain a healthy balance between enough iron to support immune system cells while also limiting the iron supply to pathogens. Magnesium is essential for hundreds of enzymatic processes in the body. In the immune system, it is vital for forming many coenzymes and cofactors needed for the complex signaling within and among white blood cells, and for developing antibodies. Most Americans are magnesium-deficient. Low magnesium can contribute to development of a cytokine storm, a severe immune reaction to an infection in which the body releases too many cytokines into the blood too quickly, and may also contribute to autoimmunity. Magnesium is also needed to produce the enzymes that metabolize vitamin D. Consequently, magnesium deficiency will reduce the effectiveness of the vitamin D supplements someone may be taking. Selenium is an essential micronutrient that has a crucial role in optimal immune responsiveness. It is a potent antioxidant that helps lower oxidative stress and reduce inflammation, ultimately enhancing immunity. Selenium deficiency leads to less robust immune responses to viruses and bacteria. Zinc: Although zinc is considered a trace mineral for dietary purposes, large quantities are essential for the immune system. Some researchers even call it the gatekeeper of immune function, given its importance in cytokine signaling and for mobilizing the cells of the adaptive immune system. Low zinc levels are known to increase susceptibility to viral infection. Zinc is necessary for maintaining the integrity of the pulmonary and intestinal mucosal barriers. It's also essential for proper function of the pathways that trigger T cell and B cell proliferation in response to infection. As a co-factor for many enzymes involved in immune cell function, zinc also plays a role in balancing pro- and anti-inflammatory immune processes. END Robert G.

His new book, Immune Reboot: Your Guide to Maximizing Immunity, Restoring Gut Health, and Optimizing Vitality, was released in December 2022. One in every two people with irritable bowel disease (IBD) is zinc-deficient, according to a recent systematic review of nine studies representing more than 2,400 IBD patients. The prevalence of zinc deficiency, based on serum zinc measurements, was higher among those with Crohn's disease (CD), affecting 54% of the patients in this subgroup, versus 41% of those with ulcerative colitis (UC). \"This is the first meta-analytic study to be conducted on the prevalence of zinc deficiency in IBD,\" wrote lead author Roberta Zupo, at the Saverio de Bellis National Institute of Gastroenterology, Castellana Grotte, Italy. \"The present research highlights the importance of considering zinc as a micronutrient to be monitored, because every second IBD patient shows a deficiency.\" Zupo and colleagues screened 152 studies that included data on nutrient deficiencies in IBD patients. Only nine trials had sufficient data on zinc, and met the researchers' strict inclusion criteria. The nine studies analyzed were all published between 2017 and 2022. The studies represented populations from Asia, Europe, and the US. A total of 1,677 of the 2,413 pooled IBD patients (69.5%) had CD, while 736 had UC. There were some differences across the nine studies regarding the threshold used to define \"deficiency.\" Some investigators used a cut-off of 70 g/dL, while others defined deficiency as serum values under 10.7 mol/L. The largest of the trials\u2014a 996 patient study published by Shivi Siva and colleagues at the University of Chicago in 2017, used a threshold of 0.66 mg/mL. But overall there was little heterogeneity between the studies they analyzed, and the risk of bias was low, according to Zupo. \"Zinc deficiency may predispose to growth retardation in young populations, and to loss of appetite, impaired immune function, and structural impairment of the intestinal endothelium. In severe cases, it may also drive hair loss, diarrhea, delayed sexual maturation, impotence, hypogonadism in males, and eye and skin lesions.\" Roberta Zupo, Saverio de Bellis National Institute of Gastroenterology, Castellana Grotte, Italy Taking the 2,413 pooled patients as a group, the overall prevalence of zinc deficiency was exactly 50%, though this number ranged from roughly 21% to over 60% across the nine studies. That 50% figure is substantially higher than the 15% prevalence reported in an earlier, smaller study of this subject (Vagianos K, et al. J Parenter Enteral Nutr. 2007). With two exceptions, most of the studies under review showed a pattern of higher prevalence of zinc deficiency among the subjects with CD compared with those who had UC. Again, there were variations between the studies in terms of the number of CD patients who showed zinc deficiency. Two studies reporting numbers over 80% in this subgroup. Zupo and colleagues believe the higher prevalence among CD versus UC patients makes sense given what is known about the process of dietary zinc absorption. This trace mineral is primarily absorbed in the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum. CD can affect any part of the GI tract, including the stomach, duodenum, and small intestines, whereas UC typically affects only the colon and the rectum. Consequently, CD is more likely than UC to affect the areas of the gut mucosa involved in zinc absorption. The authors suggest that the zinc deficiencies observed in patients with IBD reflect a combination of malabsorption intrinsic to this disease, and also to low consumption of zinc-rich foods such as beans, nuts, shellfish (especially oysters), whole grains, and dairy. Loss of zinc due to diarrhea, high-exit fistulas, and ostomies\u2014all of which are common in the context of IBD\u2014also play a role. A Pattern of Malabsorption The high prevalence of zinc deficiency fits an overall pattern of nutrient deficiency, and even malnutrition, in IBD patients. According to a recent study by Stephanie Gold and colleagues at the Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, NY, 36% of a cohort of 182 recently diagnosed IBD patients met criteria for malnutrition. The vast majority (78%) had at least one micronutrient deficiency. Those with active Crohn's were 2.8 times more likely to be malnourished (Gold SL, et al. Inflamm Bowel Dis. 2022). Chiara Vigano and her team at the San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, analyzed data from 295 adults with IBD (50% CD, 50% UC) at 11 hospitals in the Lombardy region of Italy. They found that 23% of the patients had at least one significant micronutrient deficiency, with deficiencies in B12, folate, and ferritin being among the most prevalent. Vigano and colleagues did not see any statistically significant differences between the CD and UC patients in terms of disease-related malnutrition. However, they did see correlations between disease-associated malnutrition and higher median levels of C-reactive protein. This suggests a relationship between poor nutritional status and increased inflammation, though from the perspective of causality the direction of this relationship is not clear. They presented their data as a poster at the 2022 United European Gastroenterology Week conference in Vienna last October. Deficiencies of zinc and other trace elements are major contributors to the symptom burden of IBD, and to the adverse impact of this disease on patients' quality of life. A recent study by researchers at the National Institute of Medical Science and Nutrition in Mexico City indicates that vitamin D deficiency is also common among IBD patients. Andrea Sarmiento-Aguilar and colleagues reviewed medical records from 270 IBD patients (83% UC, 17% CD), 225 of whom had vitamin D measurements included in their charts. Of this group, 48% were vitamin D insufficient, defined by serum levels between 21-29 ng/mL. An additional 34% were frankly deficient, based on a cutoff of 20 ng/mL. Major Impact on QOL Dr. Zupo and her colleagues hold that deficiencies of zinc and other trace elements are major contributors to the symptom burden of IBD, and to the adverse impact of this disease on patients' quality of life. A key component for the proper functioning of many enzymes and transcription factors, zinc is also important for regulating immune system responses, cell cycling, and apoptosis. \"Zinc deficiency may predispose to growth retardation in young populations, and to loss of appetite, impaired immune function, and structural impairment of the intestinal endothelium. In severe cases, it may also drive hair loss, diarrhea, delayed sexual maturation, impotence, hypogonadism in males, and eye and skin lesions,\" says Zupo. \"All these aspects highlight the importance of early nutritional preventive management in IBD settings, from better quality of life and healthcare burden perspectives.\" She and her colleagues consider the relationship between zinc deficiency and IBD to be bidirectional, since low serum zinc levels tend to exacerbate inflammation and damage to the GI mucosa, and mucosal damage impedes absorption of zinc and many other nutrients. A Role for Supplementation? The big question is whether zinc supplementation or intentionally increasing the intake of zinc-rich foods can raise serum zinc levels in IBD patients and mitigate the symptom burden. That question is largely still unanswered, although there are a few studies suggesting that supplementation may be beneficial. In 2001, Sturniolo and colleagues published a non-controlled study of 12 patients with quiescent CD but who showed increased intestinal permeability based on measurements of lactulose/mannitol ratios. Following eight weeks of supplementation with zinc sulfate (110 mg thrice daily), the mean lactulose/mannitol ratios were significantly lower, and 10 of the 12 patients were above the cutoff for \"normal\" permeability (Sturniolo GC, et al. Inflamm Bowel Dis. 2001). In other words, zinc supplementation seemed to tighten the loose and permeable epithelial junctions. Various researchers have proposed doses ranging from 40 mg/day for 10 days to up to 110 mg per day for 8 weeks in the IBD population. Commenting on the Sturniolo paper, Zupo and colleagues note that, \"This latter finding is critical because intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction may allow leukocytes to pass through, causing exposure to a \"storm\" of luminal antigens, a hallmark of IBD activity.\" In their 993-patient study, Siva and her team reported on a subset of 232 CD patients who were zinc-deficient at baseline, but who were able to normalize their serum zinc levels via supplementation or dietary changes over a period of 12 months. Compared with those who remained zinc-deficient, the 76 patients who were able to raise their zinc levels into the normal range (above 0.66 mcg/ml) had fewer hospitalizations, fewer surgeries, and fewer CD-related complications. The differences were statistically significant. The University of Chicago researchers observed a similar pattern among their 174 UC patients, although in this subgroup normalization of zinc levels did not result in a significant decrease in subsequent surgeries (Siva S, et al. Inflamm Bowel Dis. 2017). These data are promising, but they need to be corroborated by prospective supplementation trials. In their 2017 review on the subject of nutrient deficiencies in IBD patients, Fayez Ghishan and Pawel Kiela at the University of Arizona's department of pediatrics, note that IBD-associated diarrhea is a strong indication for zinc supplementation (Ghishan FK, Kiela PR. Gastroenterol Clin North Am. 2017). They, and other authors, have suggested that the current RDAs for zinc\u201411mg/day for adult males, and 8 mg/day for females\u2014may be too low for zinc-deficient IBD patients. Various researchers have proposed doses ranging from 40 mg/day for 10 days to up to 110 mg per day for 8 weeks in the IBD population. But Ghishan and Kiela urge caution when pushing the doses. They point out that the upper limit for avoidance of potential toxicity is 40 mg/day. Beyond that, there's a risk that zinc will interfere with absorption of iron and copper. On the other hand, it is important to be aware that increased intake of calcium or folate can impair absorption of zinc. Also keep in mind that citric acid may improve zinc absorption, whereas iron, copper, dietary fiber, and phytates found in many types of legumes and seeds, may inhibit absorption. Based on studies of patients with cystic fibrosis, chronic pancreatitis, or other conditions that tend to cause micronutrient malabsorption, Zupo and colleagues propose that daily zinc intake in the range of 30-40 mg daily, is reasonable in IBD patients. Long-haul Covid has unique features, but essentially, it is a variant of post-viral syndrome. That's good news because many of the features of post-viral syndrome are easily treated. Between 20% and 25% of all Covid patients have persistent symptoms of some sort. Those numbers are similar to what we see with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and mononucleosis; roughly 25% of college students who get mono develop chronic fatigue. There are similar patterns with other infections, such as Avian flu. This is just what you see after certain kinds of viruses. Post-Covid symptoms are diverse. For some it's persistent loss of smell, or chronic fatigue and muscle pain. For others its brain fog and cognitive impairment, or chronic respiratory problems. But the \"official\" definition of long-haul is simply any symptom after the acute phase. Everything gets lumped together. That's absurd, because the patterns are not the same. I have been researching post-viral syndromes and working with patients affected by them for the last 45 years. My interest emerged from personal experience: I had post-viral complications back in 1975. The resulting chronic fatigue sidelined me for almost a year during med school. Between 20% and 25% of all Covid patients have persistent symptoms of some sort. Those numbers are similar to what we see with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and mononucleosis. Over the years, I developed a comprehensive approach I call the SHINE Protocol. The acronym stands for: Sleep, Hormones, Infections, Nutrition, and Exercise. By addressing these five domains, we can greatly improve the health of people with post-viral CFS. Much of what we've learned from CFS is applicable to post-Covid patients. SHINE includes supplements, botanicals, hormonal therapies and in some cases, antivirals, antifungals, antidepressants, and drugs for sleep. The basic protocol includes a multivitamin, magnesium plus malic acid, melatonin, and a Valerian/Melissa combination. But there are many additional options depending on an individual's test results and clinical history. When a patient comes in saying, \"I still feel lousy,\" months after Covid, the first step is to characterize the symptom patterns. They typically fall into one of the following patterns: Fatigue, brain fog, achiness, poor non-restorative sleep: This is the majority of long Covid patients. They experience extreme fatigue, yet they don't sleep well. Energy is low; thinking and memory are foggy. Some have muscle pain. This is classic post-viral CFS. The basic SHINE protocol works well here. For post-viral CFS, 91% of people will improve if they follow it closely. Pneumonia, respiratory distress, \"shock lung\": Some patients have long-term respiratory symptoms, especially if they had severe lung involvement during the acute phase. Again, this is not unique to Covid. Other viruses can also trigger shock lung. It usually improves on its own over time, but it can cause a lot of distress. For these patients, I recommend a highly-absorbed form of curcumin, and a reduced glutathione to turn off the inflammation and the oxidative stress. And also, low-dose naltrexone to turn off the microglial activation. Some people experience difficulty breathing in the absence of actual lung damage. A pulse oximeter-available for about $25 on Amazon\u2014is a valuable tool. If someone feels short of breath, but oxygen levels are OK, the problem is likely due to vagal inflammation, not permanent alveolar damage. This occurs in roughly 27% of long-haulers. What happens is the inflamed vagus signals the diaphragm to tighten, causing a sensation of constriction. It's alarming but it does not mean there's an oxygen deficit. An oximeter can assure that oxygen is sufficient despite the sensation. This can avert panic and hyperventilation. Cardiac involvement: If a patient had cardiovascular problems tied to Covid, and shows residual impairment, think about treating with coenzyme Q10, acetyl carnitine, magnesium, and D-ribose. This needs to be coordinated with whatever conventional therapies the patient was prescribed by his/her cardiologist. Here, too, pulse oximetry provides insight. If someone has an oxygen saturation of 93 at rest, and then it drops when they walk, that's a sure sign there is actual cardiac or lung involvement, and not just vagal nerve inflammation. Loss of smell and/or taste: This is a unique feature of Covid. While many patients find that the problem resolves over a few months, for others it persists. These patients will benefit from 25-50 mg of zinc. Smell and taste are highly dependent on zinc, and also vitamin A. These two nutrients work together. For men, I recommend 8,000 IU per day of retinol. That's safe for men, but could potentially cause birth defects if a woman gets pregnant. The minimum RDA for vitamin A is about 3,000 IU for men, and 2,500 IU for women. So, 8,000 is not exactly a megadose. But I don't recommend it for women. Direct Brain involvement: Brain fog often follows Covid, and is part post-viral syndromes in general. If someone has brain fog alone, and not fatigue or other symptoms, it suggests direct brain involvement. In these cases, curcumin, antioxidants, and low-dose naltrexone are helpful. I give 750-1,500 mg of curcumin twice daily, and clinical glutathione twice daily, for 2-3 months. It's like putting out a fire\u2014we have to quench inflammation and oxidative stress. A small number of people have post-Covid encephalopathy, clots, or stroke. For them, conventional medicine is the best way to go. Allostatic Load & Long-Haul Risk Severe stress during the initial viral phase raises the odds of long-haul. If someone is not able to rest while ill with Covid, this also raises risk. It's all about allostatic load\u2014the total stress index. When you get beyond a certain stress level, you trip a hypothalamic circuit-breaker which controls sleep, hormones, and autonomic function. Once you trigger that circuit-breaker, you get CFS and fibromyalgia. Energy drops, you experience insomnia and/or non-restorative sleep. Helping People Sleep Sleep problems are common in post-viral syndromes. In most cases, this is not due to poor sleep hygiene but rather to hypothalamic dysfunction. As a holistic practitioner, you probably have some preferred sleep supplements and herbs that you recommend. I find sustained release melatonin to be helpful. I also formulated a mix of six ingredients (Valerian, Passionflower, Hops, Lemon Balm, 5-HTP, and L-theanine) that can be helpful. There are lots of natural options. Herbs tend to help people stay asleep, but they do not always help people fall asleep. So, many of these patients will need prescription drugs in addition to natural remedies. I use Trazadone (25-50 mg), Cyclobenzaprine (2.0 to 2.5 mg), and Gabapentin (100-300 mg). Zolpidem (Ambien) may also be helpful, at low doses of 5-10 mg. I keep doses low\u2014just enough to get the desired effect. Tiny doses of several things, instead of high doses of one, will create an additive effect without the 'hangover' the next day. It's akin to the traditional Chinese medicine approach of using small amounts of different herbs. This is how it should be with prescription drugs too, especially in this population, because they often have trouble detoxing drugs. Because they're not sleeping well, many of these patients lack energy during the day. Rather than caffeine or pharmaceutical stimulants, I recommend a form of Red Ginseng known as HRG80. It is hydroponically grown, so it is much less expensive than wild Ginseng, and it is very high in active constituents. I take it myself, and I'm very impressed. I studied it in 188 post-viral fatigue patients, 60% of whom improved. There was quite a dramatic increase in energy and stamina. Mitigating Viral Reactivation There are some viruses that the body kills off totally, and others like herpes, chicken pox, and EBV that the body never fully eliminates. The reasons for that are not clear. But when immunity goes down, you see a jailbreak, and these other viruses reactivate. For example, shingles is a jailbreak of the chicken pox virus. It shows up in the skin, and it is very obvious, so mainstream medicine can't ignore it. A similar process happens in other bodily systems, but instead of a big rash, it manifests as fatigue, muscle pain, etc. This is the \"I\" in SHINE\u2014the other residual infections. Reactivation is very real. We need to treat latent infections like candida and other fungi, and latent viruses. If someone has chronic nasal congestion, sinusitis, post-nasal drip, or irritable bowel syndrome, or intense sugar cravings, assume there's chronic candida and treat with Diflucan. If someone has chronic flu-like symptoms, I give Famciclovir (500-750 mg, 3x/d) and plus an NSAID. Celecoxib (Celebrex), it turns out, has antiviral effects. I'm targeting EBV, HSV1, any of the other herpes viruses. Give the combination for 4-6 months. It takes 2-4 months to see effects. By applying therapies that have proven effective in the aftermath of other viral infections, we can go a long way in helping our post-Covid patients recover quickly. -END- Jacob Teitelbaum, MD, is one of the most frequently quoted integrative medical authorities in the world.

Daily supplementation with zinc picolinate markedly reduced the prevalence of severe symptomatic COVID-19 among a cohort of high-risk patients in the state of Florida, according to data from a new case-control study. \"Individuals in the control group were 5.93 times more likely to develop symptomatic COVID-19 infection as compared with individuals in the treatment group,\" reported lead author Antonio M. Gordon, of the Department of Internal Medicine, University Health Care, Hialeah, FL. \"Controlling for co-morbidities, individuals in the control group were 7.38 times more likely to develop symptomatic COVID-19 infection as compared with individuals in the treatment group.\" \"The findings from our study suggest that zinc supplementation in all three doses (10, 25, and 50 mg) may be an effective prophylaxis of symptomatic COVID-19 and may mitigate the severity of COVID-19 infection.\" Antonio M. Gordon, MD, University Health Care, Hialeah, FL The study involved 104 patients seen at ambulatory primary care clinics, who were randomized to take 10, 25, or 50 mg of zinc daily, and another 96 patients of similar demographic background who did not take zinc. A High-Risk Cohort All patients were from communities with COVID infection prevalence of 100 cases per 100,000 or greater. Just over 60% of the subjects were female, and 90% were of Hispanic ethnicity, in keeping with the general demographics of the neighborhoods served by the clinics, which are located in Miami-Dade and Broward counties. The age range was between 58 to 84 years, with a median of 74 years. The overwhelming majority had preexisting conditions: 88% of zinc group, and 97% of disease; 37% and 45% had diabetes; 53% and 38% had COPD. Two patients in the zinc group had prior bouts of symptomatic COVID. The investigators looked at new symptomatic COVID episodes after a five-month study period from August 2020 until January 2021. In the zinc group, there were 2 COVID cases (1.92%) versus 10 (10.42%) among the control group (p = 0.015). \"The findings from our study suggest that zinc supplementation in all three doses (10, 25, and 50 mg) may be an effective prophylaxis of symptomatic COVID-19 and may mitigate the severity of COVID-19 infection,\" the authors write (Gordon AM, Hardigan PC. Front Med. 2021). There were no meaningful differences in terms of COVID prevalence or severity between the three zinc dosages. Safe and Effective In general, zinc picolinate appeared to be very safe, though during the first 4 weeks of monitoring, five participants experienced intolerable adverse effects: two had headaches potentially attributable to zinc (one on 25 mg, the other on 50 mg); three had GI symptoms including nausea and constipation. In addition to bolstering support for prophylactic use of zinc, this study also sheds light on the degree to which pre-existing conditions raise COVID risk. Statistically, for every-one unit increase in the number of co-morbidities a subject had, the likelihood of developing symptomatic COVID-19 infection increased by a factor of 1.57. This means that someone with 3 chronic conditions is nearly five times more likely to develop a serious COVID case as someone with no prior diagnoses. This study makes a good case for prophylactic use of zinc picolinate, but the authors stress that their data cannot be extrapolated to support use of oral zinc as a treatment. Though the study was not intended to elucidate mechanisms of action, the authors surmised that zinc is, \"a modulator of immune functions, a modifier of the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with a host factor such as an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptor, or the integrity of the epidermal tight junctions, or even an agent capable of acting in the microbiome.\" Metanalysis: Zinc Effective Against URIs The Gordon paper, published last December, followed closely on the heels of a new metanalysis of 28 clinical trials showing that oral or intranasal zinc supplementation can mitigate the incidence and severity of viral upper respiratory infections. Compared with placebo, oral or intranasal zinc prevented five non-COVID respiratory infections per 100 person-months. The number needed to treat (NNT) to obtain this statistically significant benefit was 20, reported Jennifer Hunter and colleagues in the November 2021 edition of the online journal, BMJ Open. They rated the quality and certainty of evidence supporting this conclusion as \"moderate.\" Dr. Hunter, a faculty member at the NICM Health Research Institute, Western Sydney University, led an international team that sifted and weighed data from 28 English and Chinese studies of zinc published between April and August 2020. NICM is one of Australia's leading centers for research in integrative medicine. Papers included in the metanalysis looked at the impact of oral, sublingual, or intranasal zinc versus placebo in people with lab-confirmed viral RTIs, or non-specific illnesses such as the common non-seasonal rhinosinusitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, influenza-like illness, or acute bronchitis. In aggregate, the trials represented 5,446 adults unlikely to be zinc-deficient. Dr. Hunter's team followed Cochrane protocols for data analysis. They included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials, but excluded prior systematic reviews, non-randomized studies, and trials lacking concurrent control groups. They also excluded 95 studies of children, and studies of adults with bacterial and other non-viral infections. This metanalysis did not include any COVID-specific data. There are currently seven randomized clinical trials underway looking at zinc in the context of COVID. Meaningful Benefits The interventions under review included a variety zinc conjugates, at varying doses, treatment durations, and administration routes, but excluded co-interventions involving other nutraceuticals, herbs or pharmaceuticals. Overall, patients who took zinc supplements had a 32% lower relative risk of developing mild to moderate RTI symptoms compared to those taking placebo controls. Lozenges were the most common form of zinc tested, followed by nasal sprays, and gels containing either zinc acetate or gluconate salts. Daily doses ranged from 15 mg to 45 mg for treatment periods of between 7 and 12 months. Doses for sublingual lozenges aimed specifically at preventing or treating rhinovirus infections were higher, ranging from between 45 mg and 300 mg daily. Doses for topical nasal zinc to prevent or treat community-acquired infections were substantially lower (0.9-2.6 mg/day) In aggregate the studies do suggest a modest but meaningful benefit from taking zinc. Overall, patients who took zinc supplements had a 32% lower relative risk of developing mild to moderate RTI symptoms compared to those taking placebo controls. \"In adult populations unlikely to be zinc deficient, there was some evidence suggesting zinc might prevent RTI symptoms and shorten duration,\" the authors note, though they add that \"the comparative efficacy/effectiveness of different zinc formulations and doses were unclear.\" Reduced Severity The largest risk reductions were for moderately severe symptoms such as fever, consistent with an influenza-like illnesses. There was an 87% lower risk of developing moderately severe symptoms compared with a 28% lower risk of developing milder symptoms. Hunter and colleagues found no significant differences based on patient age, route of zinc administration, or dose levels. The data suggest that people who take zinc have faster symptom resolution. With sublingual or intranasal zinc, symptoms resolved 2 days earlier compared with placebo. During the first week of illness, participants using sublingual or topical nasal zinc were 1.8 times more likely to recover before those on placebo, Hunter and colleagues report. However, they include the caveat that the data on symptom resolution were spotty and of \"low certainty/quality.\" There were significant reductions in Day 3 symptom severity scores among people taking zinc, though there were no differences in average daily severity scores. One interesting finding was the observation that duration of illness could be reduced in people who began taking zinc up to 3 days following onset of symptoms. This contradicts the widely held\u2014though largely unsubstantiated\u2014idea that zinc will only work if taken within 24 hours of symptom onset. Worldwide Popularity Though it did not include any COVID-specific data, Hunter and colleagues point out that they undertook this metanalysis following a World Health Organization call for rapid reviews of evidence for various popular self-care modalities for COVID-19. Across the world, zinc is among the most widely consumed supplements for colds and flu, and for immune system support. A 2019 paper by Katharine DeGeorge and colleagues in the journal, American Family Physician, cites zinc among \"treatments with proven effectiveness for cold symptoms in adults.\" It should be no surprise that zinc has gained considerable attention since the outbreak of COVID. In high-income as well as low-income countries, sales have soared since the pandemic began. Though zinc is not recognized officially in any COVID prevention or treatment guidelines, Hunter and co-authors point out that clinicians and hospitals worldwide are using it in the COVID context. Duration of illness could be reduced in people who began taking zinc up to 3 days following onset of symptoms. This contradicts the widely held\u2014though largely unsubstantiated\u2014idea that zinc will only work if taken within 24 hours of symptom onset. Over the years, several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the apparent efficacy, including direct broad-spectrum antiviral activity against many common respiratory viruses\u2014including coronaviruses. Zinc also plays a role in multiple immunological and inflammatory pathways, and assists in tissue responses to hypoxia. Generally, zinc supplements are quite safe. There were no serious adverse events associated with the mineral in the 25 trials under review. That said, some people do find oral consumption of zinc to be irritating to the mouth and nose, or even nausea-inducing. This can limit its utility in some cases. Growing Base of Evidence This new metanalysis follows two other fairly recent reviews of zinc in the context of respiratory infections. Wang and colleagues published an analysis of 20 micronutrient studies\u201410 specifically on zinc\u2014showing a 2.25-day reduction in duration of cold symptoms (Wang MX, et al. Am J Tropical Med Hygeine. 2020). A review by Aboiye and colleagues in BMJ Global Health early in 2021 concluded that zinc reduced duration of ARI symptoms by nearly 50%, though it did not reduce the actual risk of ARI (Abioye AI, et al. BMJ Global Health. 2021). The Hunter paper included significantly more studies than its predecessors, thanks to the fact that the researchers combed non-English databases for relevant trials. Though their findings are generally positive, Hunter and colleagues are careful not to overstate their conclusions. They acknowledge the limited quality of evidence in some of the included studies, as well as a fairly high risk of bias. There was also inconsistency among the included trials, in terms of forms of zinc studied, doses and treatment durations, effect sizes, and methods for measuring outcomes. On the other hand, zinc products are safe, inexpensive, and readily available. Given the ongoing threat of COVID, and the dangers of inappropriately prescribed antibiotics for URIs, zinc supplements are an option worth considering. Minimum therapeutic doses and minimum treatment time frames for zinc have yet to be scientifically established in the context of ARI. All of this leaves clinicians to face a lot of unanswered questions around the practical aspects of using zinc to treat patients. On the other hand, zinc products are generally safe, inexpensive, and readily available. Given the ongoing threat of COVID, and the dangers of inappropriately prescribed antibiotics for URIs, zinc supplements are an option worth considering. We are nearly two years into the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, more than ever, it's worth looking into what goes on in the body and how the immune system works in critical situations like COVID-19. The pandemic has certainly put the functioning of the immune system to test, but it has also brought to light the intricate pathways involved in protecting ourselves from viral pathogens. Various organs and cell types\u2014the spleen, lymph nodes, immune cells\u2014play a role in protecting the body against pathogens and toxins, an in repairing damaged tissue. In the context of a viral infection like COVID, the key players are the white blood cells. They travel throughout the body, searching for microbes and foreign particles. The T Cell Response T and B lymphocytes are the major cellular components of the adaptive immune response. T cellsare made predominantly in the thymus gland (hence the \"T\") and are involved in cell-mediated immunity. T cells, including the CD4 helper and CD8 helper cells, are responsible for memory-based natural immunity. A healthy T cell response in response to a pathogen like SARS COV2 (a positive T cell test can confirm this) should lead to a natural, protective, and relatively long-lasting immunity. Over 160 million people worldwide have now recovered from COVID-19. Many of them have a strong protective immunity, which can shield them from repeat infection, disease, hospitalization, and even death. Back in May, the World Health Organization released a report stating that within four weeks of infection, 90% to 99% of people who recover from COVID-19 develop detectable neutralizing antibodies, and that this protective response remains strong for at least 8 months after infection. The problem, of course, is that many people do not survive the initial infection. The current estimate is that 4.8 million people worldwide, and nearly 725,000 in the US, have died from COVID-19. But that does not mean we should ignore the role of natural immunity. As healthcare professionals, we should do all that we can to support our patients' innate and adaptive immune systems, so they can respond maximally when faced with the virus. Delta Variant: Outpacing Immune Cells Many people are concerned about the risk posed by the new variants, especially the Delta variant. The big problem with Delta is that it can replicate 2-3 days faster than B and T cells can. In essence, it can outpace the key immune cells, making it much harder for these cells to stop the virus and prevent symptoms or interpersonal transmission. The Delta variant also puts a greater burden on the neutralizing antibodies. The cautious good news is that while this new variant appears to spread faster, it may not necessarily be more aggressive. Viruses are promiscuous by nature; they constantly mutate and evolve. It will not be surprising if we see additional variants emerge in the future. This is all the more reason to focus on bolstering immune system capacity. Natural vs Induced Immunity The protection conferred by natural immunity is equivalent to, or perhaps better than, that of vaccine-induced immunity. But the two are not mutually exclusive. Both vaccine-induced immunity and naturally-occurring post-COVID immunity will play a role in stemming the spread of COVID and reducing its morbidity and mortality. Some people assume that documentation of a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection is synonymous with natural immunity, but really, immune status is best determined by an accurate and reliable antibody test. While antibody titers can decrease over time, T cell protective immunity-as detected by a T cell test\u2014potentially confers lifelong protection, a phenomenon acknowledged by NIH Director, Francis Collins back in July 2020. The COVID-19 vaccines induce neutralizing antibodies that circulate in the body, recognize, and bind to the virus, preventing it from entering cells and replicating. This is important, because once the virus enters cells, it is no longer accessible to the antibodies circulating outside the cells, and it's free to replicate and cause damage. An individual's response to the vaccine can be robust or weak, or anywhere in between. Though the scientific consensus and the public health community are almost unanimously supportive of vaccination, the reality is that many people remain resistant to getting the shots. Chastisement is unlikely to change their positions on the issue. Bolstering Protective Mechanisms It isvital that we do all we can to help patients nurture their intrinsic protection mechanisms, regardless of whether or not they are vaccinated. Healthy people have a well-integrated array of robust protective mechanisms, from strong and intact skin and mucosal surfaces, to balanced Th1 and Th2 immune responses. But too many people are in survival mode. They're not thriving, and they're not able to effectively protect themselves. They have co-morbidities affecting their lungs, heart, nervous system, blood vessels and other organs. They lack the essential nutrients needed for the body to function well. Co-morbidities often indicate overexposure to \"anti-nutrients\"\u2014chemical compounds that reduce the body's ability to absorb and assimilate essential nutrients\u2014and other stressors that deplete the body's nutrient stores and its metabolic capacities. Let's face it: the immune system protects those who are able to protect themselves. People can minimize their risk of serious illness from SARS-CoV-2 or any virus by ensuring they're getting enough essential nutrients, healthy activity, and sleep. We recommend that people following the Alkaline Way program to fully support and nourish the immune system. This includes: Taking vitamin D3 regularly- especially liquid drops that are assimilated and absorbed easily. This essential neurohormone helps regulate cell division and is important in many systems, especially when combined with vitamin K2. Maintaining a Vitamin D3 level of 50-80 ng/ml is a good goal. Though there are not yet any large intervention trials proving that vitamin D3 is protective against SARS-CoV-2, deficiency is a well-documented epidemiologic risk factor for infection, severe illness, and death. Zinc and Magnesium: From taste and smell to immune and neurohormone balance, zinc and magnesium are essential, yet often deficient nutrients. People at high risk show signs of metabolic acidosis. Urine pH after rest is a good indicator of whether or not someone has enough buffering minerals present to neutralize the day's excess acids from metabolism. Flavonoids like quercetin dihydrate, which function as zinc ionophores. Flavonoids are nature's way to facilitate necessary cellular uptake of zinc and other helpful minerals. Lack of essential nutrients to rebuild damaged tissue, increased exposure to anti-nutrients, lack of deep abdominal breathing, inadequate stretching/walking, and poor sleep are also predisposing factors for myriad illnesses. At its core, sustained health is determined by what people EAT, DRINK, THINK and DO. Let's all consider COVID-19 a wake-up call to invest in personal and social health. Now is the time for people to invest in self-care, personal care and cultivation of healthier habits. Small steps often bring big rewards. Multiple small steps multiply the benefits. Many Americans had their first \"taste\" of teff\u2014Ethiopia's ancient cereal staple- through the writing of Abraham Verghese, MD, the beloved Stanford surgeon who authored the 2009 novel, Cutting for Stone. The story begins in Verghese's childhood homeland of Ethiopia, and in it, the author describes his love of injera, the traditional sourdough flatbread made from teff. \"The delectable red chicken curry, doro-wat, came poured onto the soft crepelike injera used to scoop up the meat...her mouth watered just thinking of the dish\". If you've ever eaten in an Ethiopian restaurant, you've already experienced the distinct flavor and texture of bread made with this unique, gluten-free grain. Injera is created from stone-ground teff flour, which is naturally fermented over the course of several days, then poured like pancake batter onto a large, heated stone and cooked until bubbles appear. It has a porous, spongy, pancake-like texture, and it serves as both plate and utensil for eating the rich, spiced stews that are the mainstays of Ethiopian cuisine. If you haven't had the pleasure, you owe it to yourself to make a field trip to the best Ethiopian restaurant you can find. As an intact seed, it is naturally high in fiber with a low glycemic index, making it an excellent grain for stabilizing blood sugar and helping to prevent and control diabetes and heart disease. Heirloom Gluten-Free Grain Injera may be the best-known incarnation of teff, but there's far more to this heirloom grain. It makes a wonderfully satisfying breakfast porridge, and it can be used in a variety of breads, muffins, and pastries. Among the peoples of the Horn of Africa, it is sometimes mixed with chickpeas or soybeans. It can be brewed into a variety of alcoholic drinks, and it is also an important source of animal fodder. Teff (Eragrostis tef) is indigenous to Ethiopia and Eritrea, where it has served as the daily staple for roughly 90 million people for thousands of years. It is a stress-tolerant, fast-growing cereal grain that is still cultivated using ancient farming methods. But those methods are inefficient in that a significant percentage of the tiny grains\u2014roughly the size of poppy seeds\u2014are lost. In fact, the Amharic word tef, actually means \"lost\". Teff has been growing in international popularity in recent decades, as health-conscious consumers seek out ever more gluten-free options. Consequently, its price has soared. The situation was further compounded in 2006, when the Ethiopian government banned international exports for almost a decade, fearing the surging worldwide demand would cause food insecurity within Ethiopia, as was experienced in South American countries when quinoa, their local staple, became an international culinary superstar. In response to the global shortage, farmers in India, China, Australia, and the US have begun to cultivate teff. It is now grown commercially in California, Oregon, Oklahoma, Kansas and Idaho and is available as a certified gluten-free product by dedicated US farmers. Business has been booming since the COVID pandemic, says T. J. Anderson, of the Boise, ID-based Teff Company, in a video interview. With international supply chains disrupted, Ethiopian communities in the US suddenly found themselves reliant on domestic producers. And with many more people at home, experimenting in the kitchen, a new wave of Americans have discovered the grain in their quest to try new things. According to the Whole Grains Council, the number of products using teff has doubled in recent years. A Nutritional Powerhouse Though teff is the smallest of all the cereal grains, measuring less than 1 mm in diameter, it boasts an impressive nutritional profile. As an intact seed, it is naturally high in fiber with a low glycemic index, making it an excellent grain for stabilizing blood sugar and helping to prevent and control diabetes and heart disease. But it is the protein content of teff that makes it an essential part of the Ethiopian diet: teff contains all 9 essential amino acids due to its relative higher lysine content. While the exact complete protein content is under debate, one quarter cup (4 oz) of the cooked grain provides approximately 4-6 grams of complete protein (Gebru et al. Foods 2019). Teff is also rich in iron, calcium, zinc, copper and manganese. Just \u00bc cup provides 100% of the daily value of manganese. Three varieties of teff exist: one with light linen color, another with a red hue, and a darker-brown variety. The latter appears to be richer in phytonutrients than the lighter colored varieties. Because teff is closely related to millet, another gluten-free cereal grain, it is sometimes referred to as \"teff millet\". According to researchers in India who studied the nutrients in teff, \"Phytochemical analysis indicated the presence of flavonoids, saponins, tannin, glycosides, and steroids. The study showed that teff millet has high antioxidant activity...Therefore, it can be beneficial for celiac disease, hypertension, anemia, diabetes, and cancer condition. The development of food products incorporated by teff millet as a nutraceutical food can improve health and prevent different disease and disorders.\" (Chauhan A, IJPSR, 2020). Fermentation of teff, as is done in the preparation of injera, increases the bioavailability of the phenolic compounds and antioxidants. It also creates a pleasing, slightly tart taste, like sourdough breads in the west. According to researchers at the University of Ghent, fermentation of teff for 72 hours, increased the majority of soluble phenolic compounds by anywhere from 42-1805%, while decreasing insoluble phenols by 2-100% (Shumoy H, Raes K. Cereal Chem. 2016). They also note that the brown varieties of teff (Zagurey and Zezew) showed superior total phenolic and antioxidant contents compared to the white varieties (Quncho and Tsedey). Culinary Considerations Teff has a mild, nutty flavor with hazelnut, cocoa, and buckwheat undertones. It is satisfying when cooked as a porridge and served with a sprinkle of cinnamon, cloves, maple syrup, or dates and toasted nuts. Because the seeds are so tiny, they cling together, forming a creamy porridge that can be cooled to form into a cake, like polenta. Teff can also be turned into a savory \"pilaf\" by dry toasting for 2-3 minutes until the grains start to pop, then simmering it in broth and tossing with chopped fresh herbs, roasted veggies, toasted nuts and olive oil. Mixing teff with quinoa or millet will create a lighter, fluffier texture and color. If you're feeling really adventurous in the kitchen, you can try your hand at making injera. Kalkidan Tesfu's Injera for Beginners video will take you through the process, in both English and Amharic, giving non-Ethiopian viewers an opportunity to hear the tones and textures of this ancient language. Chef Sebla offers a quicker version that uses beer for fermentation, though if you make this version, the injera will no longer be gluten-free. And, in the healthier snacks department, a California-based, woman-owned company called Blue Nile Living recently introduced teff chips into the market. However you use it, you'll find that teff is a versatile, flavorful and nutritious addition to your culinary repertoire.

The immune system is an elegant and complex set of cells, proteins, and tissues designed to protect our bodies from infections, both minor and life-threatening. Both the innate and acquired immune systems are dependent upon healthy nutrition, a healthy gut microbiome, adequate rest, and management of stress. The transfer of maternal microbiota is very closely linked to a child's immune system development. Therefore, maintenance of a healthy maternal microbiome is essential for the health of both the mother and child. The use of strain-specific probiotics during pregnancy and infancy can reduce the risk of atopic sensitization, eczema and wheeze. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the incidence and/or severity of colds, flu-like symptoms, acute infectious diarrhea, as well as antibiotic use in children. A plant-rich, high fiber diet is beneficial to gut microbiota, and has been shown to reduce mortality from infectious and respiratory disease. Yet, many children fall short of the recommended intake for fiber. Micronutrients are essential for maintaining barrier function, for the growth and differentiation of B-cells and T-cells, limiting overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, having direct antiviral and antibacterial activity, and much more. In this engaging and practical webinar, Dr. Tieraona Low Dog will share her need-to- know recommendations for the use of select micronutrients and strain-specific probiotics to support the immune health of children. At the conclusion of this webinar, participants will gain a better understanding of: The role of the gut microbiome in immune health The role of strain-specific probiotics in pediatric respiratory and gastrointestinal health Indicators that identify children at risk for specific micronutrient deficiencies Appropriate micronutrient supplementation in children In this engaging and practical webinar, Dr. Tieraona Low Dog will share her need-to- know recommendations for the use of select micronutrients and strain-specific probiotics to support the immune health of children.
