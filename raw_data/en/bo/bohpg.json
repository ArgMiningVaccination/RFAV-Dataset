All rights reserved.Visit Dana-Farber online. www.dana-farber.orgPrEsIDENT's LETTEr Edward J. Benz Jr., MD President and CEO, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Dear Readers, By almost every measure, Dana-Farber is a larger, more diverse, more comprehensive, and more effective cancer center than it was two decades ago. Patient visits, research grants, and clinical trials have more than tripled since the late 1990s. Our faculty and staff have taken our research into new areas like genomics, immunotherapy, and chemical biology, and created world-class programs in palliative care, population science, safety and quality science, and other areas. We've grown geographically as well, moving into new lab space in the Longwood Medical Area and the Boston waterfront, opening the Y awkey Center for Cancer Care, and building satellite clinics and forming partnerships with community hospitals and care centers across the region. One of my priorities as Dana-Farber' s president for the past 17 years has been to maintain a sense of interconnectedness and intimacy, even as we grew larger and more complex. We want to be sure that no matter how large we become, we continue to take care of patients as we would care for our own families, and keep the sense of optimism that we can improve the outlook of future patients through research. When we developed a set of core values for the Institute, we were clear that two values in particu-lar - compassion and respect - apply both to our relationship with patients and their families and also to our relationships with one another as coworkers and colleagues. When I step down as president at the end of the year, I know the Institute will be in excellent hands. The leadership team we've assembled and new President and CEO Laurie H. Glim-cher, MD, a distinguished immunologist and successful leader, are excited to be moving forward. Scientific advances over the past two decades have generated tremendous excitement. The public is, justifiably, anxious to see this progress come to fruition in the form of better cancer thera-pies, diagnostic tests, and prevention strategies. We have to take advantage of every opportunity science gives us, whether it' s in precision medicine, immunotherapy, or other promising approaches. I know of no institition better positioned to do so than Dana-Farber. \"We have to take advantage of every opportunity science gives us, whether it's in precision medicine, immunotherapy, or other promising approaches.\" - Edward J. Benz Jr., MD 2 Paths of Progress 2016 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute In February 2016, Dana-Farber' s board of trustees announced that Laurie H. Glimcher, MD, an internationally recognized immunolo- gist, will become the Institute' s next president and CEO. Glimcher is currently the Stephen and Suzanne Weiss Dean of the Medical College at Weill Cornell Medi- cine in New Y ork City, where she is also profes- sor of medicine and pro- vost for medical affairs at Cornell University. \"Dr. Glimcher is in many ways an ideal choice for Dana-Farber,\" said Josh Bekenstein, chairman, Dana-Farber Board of Trustees. \"She is a distinguished Dana-Farber Names New President and CEOArouND ThE INsTITuTE Laurie H. Glimcher, MDimmunologist, widely renowned for her work in one of the most promising areas of cancer research. She has had extraordinary success as the leader of a major academic medical institution. Most impor - tantly, she has a deep understanding of the latest developments in cancer research and care, and a clear vision of how Dana-Farber can most powerfully affect the fight against cancer.\" Glimcher will begin at Dana-Farber in January 2017. She will also be a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Current Dana-Farber President and CEO Edward J. Benz Jr., MD, will remain in that role until her arrival. \"It is an enormous honor and privilege to be chosen as the next leader of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,\" Glimcher said. \"The opportunity to advance Dana-Farber' s groundbreaking research and to improve the care available to patients with cancer is truly special to me, and I am thrilled to be returning home to Boston. Cancer research and care have reached a transformative moment in science, and I look forward to working with all of Dana-Farber' s cli- nicians and scientists to find innovative therapies in the coming years.\" Glimcher has strong ties to the Harvard medi- cal community. Prior to joining Weill Cornell Medicine, Glimcher was the Irene Heinz Given Professor of Immunolo- gy at the Harvard School of Public Health, and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, where she headed one of the top immunology programs in the world. She is widely considered to be one of the world leaders in understanding cellular differentiation pathways in lymphocytes and has made seminal dis- coveries of key transcrip- tion factors that drive lineage commitment and activation in the immune system. Glimcher received her postdoctoral training at Harvard and in the Laboratory of Immu- nology at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md. She earned her bachelor' s degree from Radcliffe College and her medi- cal degree from Harvard Medical School. 3 www.dana-farber.org ArouND ThE INsTITuTE Kornelia Polyak, MD, PhD Dana-Farber scientists this year identified a promising new drug for a form of breast cancer and discovered one way the disease can outma- neuver the drug.Potential New Drug for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer The findings, re- ported in the journal Nature, may lead to a more farsighted treat- ment strategy for breast cancers classified as \"triple-negative\" - one that uses drug combina- tions to both arrest the disease and prevent it from resisting front-line therapies. The dual ap- proach could significant- ly extend patient survival times, the authors say. \"We found that a class of agents known as BET bromodomain inhibitors significantly impeded the growth of triple-negative breast cancer cells in laboratory as well as animal-model tests,\" says Dana-Farber' s Kornelia Polyak, MD, PhD, the study' s co-senior author. \"On the basis of these results, such inhibitors will be tested in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in a phase 2 study, and they're also included in ongoing phase 1 trials. \"Even if these drugs prove successful, we know that cancer often manages to circumvent therapies and resume its growth,\" Polyak says. \"By understanding the series of steps that allows TNBC cells to become resistant to BET inhibitors, we can devise approaches that use combinations of therapies to slow or prevent resistance.\" Connecting with Dana-Farber has never been easier.

In a joint statement, the institutions collectively recognized insufficient vaccination as a public health threat and called upon the nation' s physicians, parents, and young adults to take advantage of this rare opportu- nity to prevent many types of cancer.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, HPV infections are responsible for ap- proximately 27,000 new cancer diagnoses each year in the U.S. Several vaccines are available that can prevent the majority of cervical, anal, oropharyngeal (middle throat), and certain genital cancers. The vaccine is recommended for girls and boys when they reach age 11 or 12. Vaccination is also recom- mended for females age 13-26 and males age 13-21 who were not vaccinated when they were younger. 4 Paths of Progress 2016 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ArouND ThE INsTITuTE Dana-Farber' s Patricia Reid Ponte, DNSc, RN, NEA-BC, is now president of the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC). In her two- year term as ANCC president, which started Jan. 1, 2016, Reid Ponte will serve as chief spokesperson for the organization and lead the ANCC board in set- ting goals, policy, and long-range plans. The American Society for Clinical Oncology has chosen Bruce E. Johnson, MD, to lead the large and influen- tial cancer organiza-tion as its president in 2017. Johnson, a noted lung cancer physician- scientist and Dana- Farber' s chief clinical research officer, starts as president-elect in June 2016. His one-year term begins in June 2017. E. Antonio Chiocca, MD, PhD, has been elected president of IN ThE NEWsThe vast majority of young women with breast cancer are being tested for mutations in the cancer-suscep- tibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, suggests a study led by Dana- Farber investigators, and many of those women are using the test results to guide treatment. The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical BRCA Testing in Young Women Reaches New High Association Oncology, provides encouraging evidence that patients are following National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines that women diagnosed with breast cancer at age 50 or younger get genetic testing. At the same time, researchers found that many patients who don't carry BRCA1 or 2 mutations are choos- ing to have both breasts removed, even though their risk of cancer in the unaffected breast is no higher than average. \"Inheriting a muta- tion in BRCA1 or 2 significantly increases a woman' s risk of devel- oping breast or ovarian cancer, as well as certain other cancers,\" says the paper' s first author, Shoshana Rosenberg, ScD, MPH, of the Susan F . Smith Center for Women' s Cancers at Dana-Farber. Rosenberg and her colleagues analyzed data from nearly 900 women diagnosed with breast cancer at age 40 or younger. All were participants in a Dana- Farber-led study track- ing the treatment, tumor biology, and psychoso- cial concerns of 1,300 young women diagnosed with breast cancer. The researchers found Shoshana Rosenberg, ScD, MPHa notable increase in test-ing for BRCA mutations. Among young patients diagnosed in 2006, 77 percent had a BRCA test. By 2013, the figure had risen to 95 percent. Nearly 30 percent of these patients said that knowing or being con-cerned about genetic risk influenced their treat- ment decisions. Among these, 86 percent of those who carried BRCA mutations, and 51 per - cent of those who don't, chose to have a bilateral mastectomy, the surgical removal of both breasts. Researchers say the high percentage of those who opt for BRCA test- ing may be a result of increased attention on the subject, particularly the decision by actress Angelina Jolie to have a double mastectomy after learning she carried a BRCA mutation. the Society for Neuro- Oncology, an organiza- tion representing North American neuro-oncolo- gists and scientists. The surgical director of the Center for Neuro- Oncology at Dana- Farber/Brigham and Women' s Cancer Center will serve as president of the society for two years. 5 www.dana-farber.org ArouND ThE INsTITuTE Clinical genomic sequencing in pediatric oncology can be used to recommend therapy or pinpoint diagnosis in children with solid tumors, according to a multicenter study led by investigators from Dana-Farber/Boston Children' s Cancer and Blood Disorders Center. The study, published in JAMA Oncology, is one of the first of its kind to be conducted in pediatric oncology. Its findings bolster the case for matching children to treatment based on a tumor' s genetic charac- teristics, representing a significant step in mak- ing molecularly targeted, personalized therapy available to young cancer patients. While many adult cancer patients benefit greatly from a precision- medicine approach founded in clinical genomic sequencing and targeted therapies, these gains are only begin- ning to reach pediat- ric patients. Because childhood cancers are rare, there is relatively little data available on the mutations that drive pediatric tumors. In addition, relatively few targeted drugs are currently available for children. Even when a potentially useful tar - geted drug exists, it may lack dosing guidelines for children or may not be formulated in ways appropriate for young children. Researchers say the multicenter trial shows that, given current genomic technologies and genetic knowledge, it is feasible to sequence pediatric tumors in a clinical context and return recommendations based on those results. \"Our study and others show that if we do this kind of sequencing, we might find treatment opportunities for chil- dren,\" said Katherine Janeway, MD, lead investigator and clinical director, Solid Tumor Center at Dana-Farber/ Boston Children' s. \"And they provide open- ings for expanding our knowledge of the child- hood cancer genome and helping clinicians and scientists understand which treatments work for a given tumor.\" New Kidney Cancer Drug Shows Strong PromiseGenetic Sequencing Can Guide Treatment of Childhood Cancers Katherine Janeway, MD A powerful new drug has improved progression- free survival and increased the response rate in patients with advanced kidney cancer, compared with standard treatment in a clinical trial. There are also hints that it may help patients live longer, according to the latest results from the METEOR phase 3 clinical trial, which is comparing the drug cabozantinib with everolimus (Afinitor), currently the standard treatment. Dana-Farber oncologist Toni Choueiri, MD, is senior author on the latest report of findings from the clinical trial, which shows that cabozantinib shrank tumors in more patients (75 percent) than everolimus (48 percent). The findings were presented in January at the 2016 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium in San Francisco. The improvements were seen in previously treated patients, including those who received immunother - apy with checkpoint inhibitor drugs. In the first 375 patients treated in METEOR, cabozantinib lengthened the median period of time before the cancer worsened - 7.4 months versus 3.8 months with everolimus. In addition, early analysis has detected a trend toward improved survival in cabozantinib-treated kidney cancer patients. A total of 658 patients with advanced clear cell kidney cancer were enrolled in the trial. 6 Paths of Progress 2016 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute A closer look at a few of the thousands of words associated with cancer medicine and research. chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL): A slow-growing blood cancer and the most common adult leukemia in which too many immature white blood cells (called lymphocytes) are found in the blood and bone marrow. endoscopy: A proce- dure in which a doctor uses a thin optical instrument called an endoscope to look inside the body - often the esophagus, stom-ach, or portions of the intestine. precision medicine: A form of treatment in which drug therapy is geared to the specific genetic abnormalities within a patient' s tumor. trastuzumab: Also known as Herceptin, this drug is often used to treat HER2- positive breast cancer.

CANCER DICTIONARYcANcEr DICTIONAR y ArouND ThE INsTITuTE Dana-Farber scien- tists have gained a key insight into how prostate tumors start - not by rewriting DNA code in cells, but by repro- gramming the master regulator of key genes involved in cell growth. The findings are a step toward understanding how prostate cancer originates and could open opportunities for prevention and treat- ment, per a study in Nature Genetics. The researchers, led by Dana-Farber' s Mat- thew Freedman, MD, and Mark Pomerantz, MD, say they have identified the \"first mechanistic insights into a key set of events\" that prods prostate cells down the road to cancer. It' s been a longstanding question, because few gene mutations have been found in prostate tumors. \"This led us to wonder, is there another process going on?\" says Freedman, of the Center for Cancer Genome Discovery and Center for Functional Cancer Epigenetics. The investigators spotted evidence of the cellular reprogramming when they compared normal and cancerous prostate cells from sev- eral patients. The pro- Matthew Freedman, MD (right), and Sandor Spisak, PhDNew Clues to Origins of Prostate Cancer cess is termed \"epigen-etic,\" because it controls how genes operate, but doesn't make permanent changes in their DNA. The androgen receptor is a protein activated by male hormones that turns on or off genes that con- trol prostate cell growth and other functions. The study demonstrated that this epigenetic program is altered during prostate cancer formation. Because epigenetic reprogramming can po- tentially be reversed, the authors say it might be possible in the future to use drugs aimed at epi- genetic targets to prevent or treat prostate cancer. 7 www.dana-farber.org Why does Dana-Farber need other locations? Our Boston campus is limited in size, and our buildings are filling up. Having a network of locations allows us to continue to grow and provide high-quality patient care to more people. It' s also a core part of Dana-Farber' s mission, to reach as many cancer patients as we can, providing them with the high level of expertise and care for which we're known. Our growth is genuinely based on that mission of serving patients. Does this really help patients? Absolutely. We know from sur - veys that many patients strongly prefer to be treated near home. And we have patients for whom simply driving into Boston and parking is stressful. Treating them in the community helps them avoid those challenges. At the same time, if needed, they can still access the really sophisti - cated resources that may only be available on our main campus. How do you find places that are a good fit for Dana-Farber? Our goal is to work with the highest quality potential partners in the areas where we want to be. That philosophy was clearly the underpinning if you look at the specific hospitals and physician practices that we work with today in New England. We've chosen to partner with really high-quality community hospitals and the best oncology practices in the region. What does the future hold? Our strategy is one of continued growth. The rationale behind that is not just mission or finances, but also because it fits with the chang- ing reality of cancer care. Cancers are increasingly stratified by their molecular features. It' s the era of precision medicine. The eligibil- ity criteria for our clinical trials are narrowing and in order to find patients for those trials, we need to be reaching more cancer patients. What are the challenges of expanding to new locations? We have a very special way of caring for cancer patients that requires a tightly knit system and a certain culture that really puts the patient and their family first. It' s hard to bottle the culture that makes Dana-Farber so special and export it to other sites. That' s why we choose very carefully when we enter a new affiliation.euro-oncologist Andrew Norden, MD, MPH, sees patients in the Center for Neuro-Oncology at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women' s Cancer Center, but his larger role is that of chief medical officer of Dana-Farber Community Cancer Care and associate chief medical officer of the Dana-Farber network.

Jann, who lives in Dighton, Mass., is a self-described gym rat and a highly competitive fitness buff who enjoys adventure vacations. But biking up a mountain in Colorado in August with his wife and friends, he was short of breath and fell behind the others. Moreover, he had noticed a swelling the size of a peanut under the skin of his neck - but he dis- missed it as a harmless fatty growth. Still, his group biked 50 miles a day dur - ing the trip, and Jann did OK. In Septem- ber, his doctor examined the neck lump and was concerned. A scan revealed other lumps inside his body. Next were the biopsies and, when he and his wife met with a physician, Jann was told he had chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a blood cancer and the most common adult leukemia, a type that typically grows slowly. \"He said I might not need treatment for seven or eight years,\" Jann says. So, reassured, he went into watch-and-wait mode, and continued his daily workouts. However, watching and waiting ended suddenly just four months later, when things went downhill - fast. Antibiotics failed to quell a stubborn cough and a stomach bug, then vomiting and weight loss put Jann in the hospital. His CLL was behaving aggres- sively and, in May 2014, when he was referred to oncologist Matthew Davids, MD, in the CLL center at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women' s Cancer Center (DF/BWCC), he got even worse news. Tests showed his CLL cells contained an ominous type of DNA damage - the deletion of a chromosome segment known as 17p - that makes chemotherapy much less effective and creates a very poor prognosis - historically two to three-year survival. \"I was shocked,\" Jann admits. \"It was very scary. But Dr. Davids has a way about him. He just said, 'We're going to address this.'\" Davids had a reason for his confidence. He was leading a clinical trial of a new cancer drug that was showing exciting promise in CLL patients. Called ABT -199 (now known as venetoclax), it belongs to a class of drugs called Bcl-2 inhibitors that are just emerging from three decades of research. They disable the Bcl-2 \"pro- survival\" proteins that enable cancer cells to escape the \"pro-death\" signals that com- mand abnormal cells to self-destruct through apoptosis, a natural quality-control process in the body. One member of Jann' s treatment team referred to venetoclax as \"the rock-star drug.\" By the time Jann started on a venetoclax clinical trial in December 2014, two other drug therapies had failed and he had large lumps in his neck and inside his body. Venetoclax is an oral drug; Jann took four pills every morning. \"Within the first month, I could feel the lumps going down, and then they were all gone,\" recalls Jann. \"I felt normal.\" The drug can have side effects, but Jann experienced only some mild nausea and bloating. By May 2015, the raging leukemia had been driven into retreat, leaving only a barely detectable trace 11 www.dana-farber.org \"Venetoclax has curative potential, particularly if used in combination with other drugs.\" - Matthew Davids, MD of cancer in his bone marrow. To be on the safe side, Davids recommended that Jann undergo a reduced-intensity donor stem cell transplant to wipe out any hidden cancer. Again, fortune shone on Jann. Stem cell transplants, even reduced-intensity ones, are risky procedures that require stem cell donors who are immunologically matched to the recipients. Jann' s sister, Lisa Murphy, was a perfect match and he had a successful procedure in June 2015, under the care of Edwin Alyea, MD, at DF/BWCC. \"Many CLL patients on vene- toclax achieve a minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative complete response, which means that even with highly sensitive techniques we cannot detect any leukemia in their body,\" explains Davids. \"Although this is not necessarily equivalent to cure, it does sug- gest that venetoclax has curative potential, particularly if used in combination with other drugs.\"Striking Response Rate The promising outcomes with venetoclax in the DF/BWCC-led phase 1 clinical trial for CLL were presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) meeting in December 2015 and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Venetoclax was administered to patients with relapsed or treatment-resistant CLL. Almost 90 percent of the patients had high-risk genetic features - like Jann' s 17p deletion - predicting a poor outcome. Of the 106 patients, 79 percent re- sponded, meaning the amount of cancer was reduced significantly. In an impressive 20 percent, the leukemia went into complete re- mission. And, in several patients, the cancer became totally unde- tectable, even by very sensitive testing. The results were particu- larly remarkable considering how sick these patients were at first. Bcl-2 inhibitors like venetoclax \"are going to change practice across many cancers,\" says An- thony Letai, MD, PhD. Research in Letai' s Dana-Farber laboratory has produced a series of discov- eries and tools for the develop- ment of Bcl-2 inhibitors and for predicting which types of cancer might respond best. \"Dana-Farber Matthew Davids, MD, examines a scan of a cancer patient. 12 Paths of Progress 2016 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute \"This could perhaps form the backbone for a combination therapy that is free of chemotherapy.\" - Jennifer Brown, MD, PhD has been an academic leader at every part of this program, from understanding the basic biochem- istry all the way to the clinic,\" he says. Investigators predict that even though venetoclax worked well by itself, it will be more potent when combined with other drugs. In a phase 1B study presented at the ASH annual meeting in December 2015, venetoclax combined with a standard antibody drug, rituximab, achieved an overall response rate of 86 percent in CLL patients: An astonishing 41 percent went into complete remission, with similar results in various high-risk subgroups, including those with a 17p deletion. Interestingly, notes Davids, eight patients who achieved MRD-negative complete response elected to stop taking venetoclax, and none of these patients has had clinical relapse. Some of them were still in complete remis- sion approaching two years after their last dose. Davids says this suggests that combining vene- toclax with other active drugs in CLL has the potential to achieve deep and durable responses without the need for continuous venetoclax dosing. \"I am very excited about venetoclax as a novel class of inhibitors that affects Bcl-2, particularly because some of its mode of action suggests that it may work well in combination with ibrutinib [another new CLL treatment],\" says Jennifer Brown, MD, PhD, director of the CLL treatment center at DF/BWCC. \"This could perhaps form the backbone for a potential com- bination therapy that is free of chemotherapy.\" Fulfilling a Vision The Food and Drug Administra- tion (FDA) has designated veneto-clax a \"breakthrough therapy,\" for CLL and acute myeloid leukemia. If approved, as many expect in 2016, it will be, among other things, the fulfillment of a vision that Dana-Farber' s Stanley Kors- meyer, MD, conceived but did not live to see realized. Korsmeyer, who headed Dana- Farber' s Program in Molecular Oncology from 1998 until his death from cancer in 2005, discovered the role of Bcl-2 in cancer nearly 30 years ago. In At left, Emily Su, Shruti Bhatt, PhD, and Jing Deng, PhD, work in the laboratory of Anthony Letai, MD, PhD. At right, patient Roy Jann enjoys the great outdoors with his wife, Karen Boch. 13 www.dana-farber.org \"It's amazing how far they've come in being able to treat my disease.\" - Roy Jannthe 1980s, he and his colleagues at Washington University in St. Louis identified Bcl-2 (for B-cell lymphoma-2) as a gene and protein present at abnormally high levels in lymphoma cells that allowed them to defy the body' s efforts to eliminate them through apoptosis, or programmed cell death. The late Korsmeyer showed that Bcl-2 acted as a survival pro-tein for cancer cells, which would normally self-destruct like other damaged, unwanted, or dangerous cells when ordered to do so by signals from within and outside the cells. Lympho-ma cells harnessed Bcl-2 proteins, he demonstrated, to intercept and block apoptotic death signals. He went on to show that Bcl-2 was the ringleader of about 20 genes and proteins that regulate apoptosis, and that Bcl-2 is over - expressed in multiple cancers. In doing so, he was one of the founders of an entire field of research directed at understand- ing the program of cell death in normal and cancer cells. If cancer was dependent on these survival proteins, reasoned Korsmeyer and others, it might allow a new approach - designing drugs that blocked the survival signals so that apoptosis could destroy the cancer. While at Dana-Farber, he and Letai, who was then a postdoctoral fellow in Korsmeyer' s laboratory, showed that CLL was dependent on - in fact, \"addicted\" to - Bcl-2. They found that CLL cells were very efficiently killed in the laboratory by Bcl-2 inhibitor compounds that were the forerunners of ABT - 199. Letai would later discover Bcl-2 addiction in other cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leu- kemia (ALL), and some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. These findings prompted expansion of clinical trials of ABT -199 to these diseases as well. Discovering the importance of Bcl-2 in cancer was one thing: figuring out how to block it potently and selectively, to avoid serious side effects, was another. Korsmeyer helped found a company, and he and Letai also worked with Abbott Laboratories to devise potential Stanley Korsmeyer, MD (left), shown with Anthony Letai, MD, PhD, was a pioneer in Bcl-2 inhibitor research.Bcl-2 inhibitors. Abbott - the predecessor to AbbVie - working with Genen- tech developed a series of com- pounds that bind to a particular site that Bcl-2 molecules use to prevent cancer cell death. The first compound to be given to patients in trials was ABT -263 (navitoclax) in 2009. While it was modestly effective, it also destroyed blood- clotting platelets, which limited the doses that could be given. As a next step, AbbVie re-engineered the compound to eliminate that problem, and the new drug, ABT -199, entered clinical trials in 2011. \"It' s amazing how far they've come in being able to treat my disease,\" Jann says. \"If I had got- ten this cancer three or four years ago, I wouldn't be alive now.\" But he is very much alive. He' s begun working out with a per - sonal trainer amid precautions to prevent infections because of his still-recovering immune system. He' s also back to work part-time, dealing with clients remotely from home. If all continues to go well, this June, nearly two years after he was first diagnosed, he plans to resume full-time work. The Dana-Farber investiga- tors are also working full-time to improve and expand the promis- ing role of Bcl-2 inhibitors in this new attack on stubborn and life-threatening cancers.

Hope was scant, too; there was almost no research going on to understand the disease. Things have changed. Research at Dana-Farber is uncovering the genetic changes that cause the cancer to form and grow. This work is beginning to pay off, with collaboration from Fuchs and other clinical specialists at the Center for Esophageal and Gastric Cancer at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women' s Cancer Center (DF/BWCC). Not only is this research leading to the testing of new Paths of Progress 2016 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute 14 W treatments for esophageal cancer, but also it is add- ing an investigative dimension to the center' s already unique multispecialty care, provided by oncologists, radiologists, and a surgical team with expertise in minimally invasive techniques. This all-hands-on-deck approach to finding new ways to treat esophageal cancer could not be more timely. Survival rates for this rare disease remain low, while the number of cases diagnosed each year is on the rise. Some forms, such as esophageal adenocarcinoma, have risen 600 percent over the last 30 years. \"For a while, it was the most rapidly increasing cancer in the U.S.,\" says oncologist Peter Enzinger, MD, director of the Center for Esophageal and Gastric Cancer. Esophageal cancer typically affects men over age 50, so numbers may be increasing as the popula- tion ages. Alcohol and smoking are also risk factors. Obesity, on the rise in the U.S., also increases the risk of the disease. The connection between obesity and esophageal cancer is clear statistically, but the mechanism isn't fully understood. Doctors speculate that added weight in the body increases pressure inside the abdomen, which could lead to more acid reflux, causing damage that raises the risk of cancer. Esophageal cancer can be found early through an endoscopy, in which a doctor uses a scope to look inside the esophagus and stomach. But doctors don't routinely screen for the disease and patients often ignore warning signs, such as frequent heartburn, weight loss, or abdominal discom - fort. As a result, the disease is diagnosed in many patients www.dana-farber.org 15 Above: Charles Fuchs, MD, MPH (left), shown here with Kimmie Ng, MD, MPH, and Brian Wolpin, MD, MPH, is helping form new national guidelines for treating esophageal and stomach cancer.By ELIZABETh DouGhErTyUnderstanding Esophageal Cancer Collaborative efforts are bringing new therapies to this rapidly rising disease . at an advanced stage, lowering their chances of survival. \"People with persistent heartburn should get endoscopies, especially if they are age 50 or older,\" says Enzinger. A Home Base for Patients Because there are so few cases of esophageal cancer each year, oncologists in community hospitals rarely see enough patients to develop the depth of ex- perience needed to treat them. With case numbers on the rise, the field needed a place where patients could find expert care. So, in 2014, DF/BWCC formed the Center for Esophageal and Gastric Cancer to bring together a core group of experts to develop the best practices for caring for these patients. At a first visit to the center, a patient typically sees a surgeon, radiation oncologist, and medical oncologist, who review the case together and 16 Paths of Progress 2016 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute In his work with patients, surgeon Scott Swanson, MD, aims for a minimally invasive approach, including robotically guided surgery.recommend a course of action. \"This is a disease where it' s really important to involve all the specialties, because com- bining all three modes of treat- ment \u2014 surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy \u2014 leads to the best outcomes,\" says Enzinger. A typical patient will begin with chemotherapy to treat any cancer that may have spread into the liver or lungs. During chemo-therapy, radiation is applied to control the main tumor. Surgery follows to remove the cancer. For patients diagnosed early, the team also offers localized treatment that removes only the lining of the esophagus, so patients don't need more extensive surgery. The center' s team of thoracic surgeons have a spectrum of minimally invasive approaches, including robotically guided surgery. \"There' s never a gap in coverage; it' s a comprehensive team effort,\" says thoracic sur - geon Scott Swanson, MD, chief surgical officer of DF/BWCC and disease center leader of the Thoracic Oncology Program. In the past, some patients were deemed too sick for esophageal surgery, which is often a criti- cal part of treatment. But with minimally invasive techniques, surgery is now a safe option for a wider range of patients. Swanson and other surgeons in the center now routinely perform the proce- dure on elderly patients, and also operate with success on obese patients and those with advanced heart disease. The procedure may involve removing all or part of the pipe that connects the throat to the stomach, yet patients typically spend less than a week in the hos- pital and leave with small inci- sions on the chest and abdomen. \"Most patients go home surprised at how well they feel,\" Swanson says. \"Doing this sur - gery is a lot more rewarding now, because patients do so well.\" The surgical team' s expertise is one reason why the center' s mor - tality rate for esophageal cancer was up to 10 times better than the national average, says Swanson. Research Drives Advances in Care Treatment advances in other cancers helped fuel the first steps toward better esophageal cancer drugs. For example, when newer chemotherapy drugs worked for other cancers, researchers tried them in esophageal to see if they' d work there, too. \"That did move the needle in terms of improving patient outcomes,\" says Fuchs. More recently, however, the field has become poised for more significant improvements. In cases of breast cancer that are HER2-positive, meaning the HER2 gene is overactive driving the tumor' s growth, trastuzumab (Herceptin) is used to block that growth mechanism. For these patients, survival rates have im- proved substantially. It turns out that some forms of esophageal cancers are also HER2-positive, and trastuzumab also improves outcomes for this group of patients. Dana-Farber' s Adam Bass, MD, co-director of the 17 www.dana-farber.org Oncologist Peter Enzinger, MD, is one of a core group of experts working to develop the best practices for caring for patients with esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and related conditions.

They recently found that a gene called PD-L2 is expressed in some esophageal tumors. PD-L2 is part of a cloaking mechanism many tumors use to hide from the immune system, which would otherwise attack the cancer cells. In recent years, pharmaceuti- cal companies have developed a \"checkpoint inhibitor\" drug called pembrolizumab (Keytruda) that deactivates the cloaking mechanism so that the immune system can find and attack the tumor. The development of pem-brolizumab was based in no small part on the early investigations of Dana-Farber scientist Gordon Freeman, PhD, into the basic workings of the immune system and checkpoint proteins. While these immunotherapy drugs were developed for more commonly studied cancers, such as melanoma, Enzinger and Fuchs are working with pharmaceutical partners to test pembrolizumab in esophageal cancer. Enzinger is leading a clinical trial at DF/BWCC for esopha- geal cancer that was slated to begin recruiting patients in early 2016. Fuchs is also leading a trial involving pembrolizumab for patients with gastric cancer. The center is applying its all- hands-on-deck approach to these trials, as well, by involving sur - geons in the investigative process. Patients will be biopsied before and after treatment with the drug so that Bass, Fuchs, and Enzinger can evaluate the drug' s effects and learn more about the tumors in which it works best. As promising as immunotherapy may be, Bass has also uncovered other possible options. In his laboratory, Bass grows tumor samples from patient biopsies in plastic dishes or animal models, turning them into models of the cancer. His team is working to make many copies of each model and then test an array of drugs and drug combinations against them to see which drugs work best in different circumstances. \"Patients want us to figure this out in the laboratory so that we can then bring the best ideas forward into clinical trials,\" Bass says. For a long time, oncologists had little to offer patients with esophageal cancer. But now, through collaborative efforts at the center to both advance clinical care and move research forward, options are expanding rapidly. \"There' s an opportunity to make radical improvements in this field,\" Enzinger says. \"We're working hard to make that happen.\" 18 Paths of Progress 2016 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute By roBErT LEVy ArT By TINGhu ZhANG, PhD, AND JohN DIGIANNI The chain of red hexagons twisting through the hollow of a polished blue cavern in the image at right is a chemist' s view of one of the most promis- ing anti-cancer compounds now under study. Known as THZ1, it was originally fabricated by Dana-Farber scientists to inhibit a protein called JNK, which is often overactive in cancer cells. Later tests showed it to be the first compound capable of irreversibly blocking CDK7 (the lumpy blue struc-ture in the illustration), a protein that is a prime target for cancer therapies. It accomplishes this feat by virtue of its shape: it fits snugly inside a pocket on CDK7 and contains a crystal \"warhead\" called acrylamide that carries it directly to the protein. The result is an exceptionally tight and long-lasting bond between THZ1 and CDK7, suggesting THZ1 could be effective against certain cancers. CDK7 is part of the cell' s machinery for switching genes on. The diagram at far right shows how THZ1 can interfere with this machinery. When a gene is activated, a section of DNA loops around to bring two sections next to each other. A group of proteins, including CDK7, converge at the point of overlap to transfer genetic information from DNA to RNA. In many cancers, this transfer process, known as DNA transcription, runs nonstop. This can ramp up the production of certain cancer-related proteins. To bring this runaway transcription under con- trol, scientists have long sought to block some of the proteins that drive it. Unfortunately, one of the major groups of these proteins, known as transcrip- tion factors, have been notoriously difficult to block with drug molecules. Hence the appeal of CDK7 as a drug target. \"The ability of THZ1 to target CDK7 suggests it may be a potent inhibitor for cancers and other diseases,\" says Dana-Farber medicinal chemist Tinghu Zhang, PhD, who first synthesized THZ1 (and the scientist for whom it is named). \"In animal studies, it has shown to be very effective against small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma, and some blood cancers.\" Work is now underway to develop THZ1 into a drug that can be tested in patients in clinical trials.

Our medicine cabinet may already hold keys to fighting some cancers. By roBErT LEVy To view the latest drugs being tested to prevent cancer, you could visit any of hundreds of academic and pharmaceuti- cal laboratories around the world. There, you' d see scientists poring over images of chemical structure and computer data, attempting to identify the most promising drug candidates. Or, you could visit your medicine cabinet.The notion that existing drugs - not just compounds created at a cost of millions of dollars and consuming decades of research work - could help prevent cancer might sound like a disreputable Internet rumor. But research findings stretching over more than a decade argue in favor of it. 22 Paths of Progress 2016 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Paired with healthy habits like exercise, common medicine cabinet items such as aspirin, vitamin D, and metformin show potential in preventing some cancers. The names of these potentially cancer-preventing drugs and compounds read like the inven- tory of any self-respecting local pharmacy: aspirin, vitamin D, and metformin (widely used for diabetes). And, if one of the healthiest activities known to humankind counts as preven- tive medicine, exercise should be included as well. \"There' s a great deal of interest- ing science being done to under - stand the fundamental biologic pathways involved in cancer. We're discovering that a number of compounds used routinely to treat other conditions or maintain health may actually target some of these pathways,\" says Charles Fuchs, MD, MPH, chief of the Division of Gastrointestinal Oncology at Dana-Farber/ Brigham and Women' s Cancer Center (DF/BWCC). Fuchs has led numerous stud- ies of aspirin and other common medicines' ability to prevent colorectal cancer, or prevent it from recurring in people who have had the disease. The advan-tage of such known compounds is not only economic but logistical: As they're already known to be safe, they can pass through clini- cal testing more speedily. Early Clues The first sign that aspirin might have a future in colorectal cancer prevention came in the 1980s, in laboratory studies that suggested Study, which began tracking the health of 122,000 nurses in 1976, had been collecting data on participants' aspirin use since its inception. Study leaders were hoping to determine if regular use reduced the risk of heart disease. Fuchs put the data through a dif- ferent kind of filter: \"We asked whether women who took aspirin had a lower risk of colon cancer,\" he says. The result, published in 2005, that aspirin-like compounds can reduce the proliferation of colon cancer cells. It was postulated that aspirin interfered with a growth- related enzyme called COX-2 in the tumor cells. To pursue the matter fur - ther, Fuchs and his colleagues analyzed data from a long-term epidemiological study in which a connection between aspirin and cancer prevention wasn't even on the radar. The Nurses' Health 23 www.dana-farber.org Level I evidence, the strongest type, that aspirin can be a form of chemo-prevention for colon cancer,\" Fuchs remarks. Fuchs and his team next set out to determine whether aspi- rin could help people already diagnosed with colorectal cancer. As before, they hopped aboard a study that was already underway. \"The National Institutes of Health had launched a clinical trial of a potential new therapy for patients with stage III colon cancer,\" \"There's a great deal of interesting science being done to under - stand the fundamental biologic pathways involved in cancer.\" - Charles Fuchs, MD, MPH was unequivocal: Regular aspirin- takers had a significantly lower risk of developing colorectal cancer, and the benefit was di- rectly related to how much aspirin they took. Those who took higher amounts received, on average, more of a gain than those who took lower amounts. This kind of accordance, known as a \"dose-response\" relationship, is power - ful information in science. \"When we see that kind of relationship, it gives us a better sense that as- sociations are real,\" Fuchs says. Investigators now had two types of evidence that aspirin and re- lated compounds could lessen the risk of colorectal cancer occur - rence or recurrence - results from laboratory experiments and from a large \"observational\" study that followed people' s health over a period of many years. The stron- gest evidence would need to come from an interventional clinical trial, a carefully controlled study in which the effect of aspirin would be compared to that of a placebo, or inactive pill, in people at risk for colorectal cancer. The results of that trial showed that participants who took aspirin or celecoxib, a pain-reliever that hits the same molecular target as aspirin, had a smaller chance of developing adenamatous colon polyps - noncancerous growths in the lining of the colon that can be a forerunner of cancer - than those who took a placebo. \"The findings of this study provided he relates. \"We 'nested' a study inside it, distributing question- naires about aspirin use to the study participants.\" The compli- ance rate - the proportion of participants who completed and turned in the questionnaire - was an astounding 98 percent. Aspirin and related medications again came out as winners: Patients who took aspirin or celecoxib along with chemotherapy follow- ing surgery survived longer than those who took a placebo. On the basis of these findings, DF/BWCC' s Jeffrey Meyerhardt, MD, MPH, and Fuchs launched a nationwide clinical trial in which patients newly diagnosed with colon cancer were randomly as- signed to receive either celecoxib or a placebo to determine if add- ing celecoxib to standard therapy could improve patient results. Researchers then circled back to the place where hints of an anti-cancer role for aspirin first surfaced - the laboratory. By studying the molecular machinery within colorectal tumors, they're hoping to identify which patients have the most to gain from aspirin therapy. One study, led by Fuchs, found that patients with colorec- tal tumors high in COX-2 had a sharply lower chance of dying of colorectal cancer if they took aspirin following treatment. An- other study, led by Dana-Farber' s Shuji Ogino, MD, PhD, found a similar survival boost for patients whose colorectal tumor cells 24 Paths of Progress 2016 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute carried a mutation in the gene PIK3CA. (Both sets of findings will need further confirmation be- fore they affect patient treatment.) With the case for aspirin as a colorectal cancer preventer seemingly sealed, one might expect public health authorities to recommend it for people at risk for the disease. In 2007, however, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force announced that while there' s sufficient evidence of as- pirin' s effectiveness, the potential risks of regular aspirin consump- tion (mainly gastrointestinal bleeding) outweigh its benefits. Some in the research community have argued vigorously against this ruling, and in late 2015 the task force announced it' s recon- sidering its decision. Familiar Names Meanwhile, evidence is mount- ing that vitamin D can also help protect against colorectal cancer. A study presented last year by Dana-Farber' s Kimmie Ng, MD, MPH, found that patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had high levels of the vitamin in their bloodstream prior to chemo- therapy treatment survived longer, on average, than patients with lower levels. The study didn't ex- amine whether there is a biologi- cal cause-and-effect relationship between higher vitamin D levels and extended survival, so it' s premature to recommend the vitamin as a treatment for colorectal cancer, researchers say. Another agent gaining attention in colorectal cancer prevention is metformin, a standard drug for type 2 diabetes. Able to reduce glucose (sugar) production by the liver, metformin also has a way of easing cancer cells' frenzied use of energy - possibly mimicking the benefits of healthy diet and exercise. Meyerhardt is leading a clinical trial of metformin for patients with colorectal cancer. The most readily available, least expensive of all health interven- tions - exercise - is also getting a look as a potential colorectal cancer deterrent. \"We've led three observational studies on exercise, and they consistently show that patients who are more physi- cally active have a lower risk of recurrence and of dying from the disease,\" Meyerhardt says. The optimal amount of exercise neces- sary to attain maximum benefit seems to be about 150 minutes a week of moderate activity such as brisk walking, although lower levels of exercise probably are beneficial as well. Meyerhardt is now leading a study involving survivors of colorectal or breast cancer to see whether exercise af- fects participants' blood levels of insulin and inflammation-causing compounds, high amounts of which can spur cancer growth. Because so much evidence points to, but doesn't conclusively show, an anti-colorectal cancer role for aspirin, vitamin D, Kimmie Ng, MD, MPH, and her colleagues study whether vitamin D has a protective effect against colon cancer. \"[studies] show patients who are more physically active have a lower risk of recurrence.\" - Jeffrey Meyerhardt, MD, MPH 25 www.dana-farber.org Learn more about exercise and cancer. Visit our page at www.dana-farber.org/exercise.metformin, and exercise, Mey- erhardt walks a fine line when discussing them with patients. \"I tell them we have observational studies of the benefits of these approaches, but no definitive data from randomized clinical trials yet,\" he remarks. \"I say that the data for the benefits of exercise are strong and consistent. For ex-ercise and vitamin D, in particu- lar, I talk about the general health benefits they can provide.\" Up Next: Breast Cancer The encouraging news about aspirin and colorectal cancer has sparked interest in studying it in other forms of cancer as well. Ironically, however, the very ordinariness of aspirin has mili- tated against such research. \"Clinical trials on drugs are typically funded by the compa- nies that develop and produce them. In the case of aspirin - a generic drug that costs less than $6 for a year' s supply - there' s no financial incentive for manufac- turers to understand how it might be helpful in cancer,\" says Wendy Chen, MD, MPH, a breast cancer physician-researcher in the Susan F . Smith Center for Women' s Cancers at Dana-Farber. The obstacles don't end there; some exist within academic re-search centers themselves. Inter - nal review panels - which examine proposed studies to ensure they protect patients and are scientifi- cally sound - are often more interested in research into cutting-edge, targeted thera- pies than in old standby drugs, however compel- ling the science in their favor may be, Chen remarks. Such imped- iments didn't dissuade Chen. In 2010 she and Michelle Holmes, MD, PhD, of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health published an observational study that showed that women with breast cancer who took aspirin at least once a week were 50 percent less likely to die of breast cancer. A British study two years later produced similar findings. Chen, Holmes, and Eric Winer, MD, director of Breast Oncology at the Susan F . Smith Center, pro- cured a $10 million Breakthrough Grant from a U.S. Department of Defense Office research program to organize a clinical trial that will test whether aspirin helps women (and men) with breast cancer avoid a recurrence of the disease and live longer. The trial will enroll 3,000 patients in the first clinical test in the U.S. of aspirin in the disease. While such studies may lack the cachet of trials involving the latest laboratory creations, they deserve to be carried out with equal scientific rigor and care, Fuchs says. \"Our goal is to test these familiar drugs with the same scrupulousness as we would use in a test of chemotherapy agents. If we're going to recom- mend them for use in patients, we want to be sure the science supports us.\" Wendy Chen, MD, MPH, helped lead a study that found aspirin can be beneficial for women with breast cancer. 26 Paths of Progress 2016 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute By sAuL WIsNIAHANDS-ONLeadership In nearly 25 years of heading major institutions of academic medicine, Edward J. Benz Jr., MD, has earned nearly as much praise for his people skills as for his clinical and research expertise. Now, as he prepares to vacate his Dana-Farber leadership roles after 16 years as president and CEO, Benz admits this was not always the case. While attending Catholic high school in his native Allentown, Pa., Benz once offended the nun teach- ing his sophomore biology class by correctly stating that there were 46 chromosomes in human cells - not 48, as she insisted. The irate instructor sent Benz to confession after forcing him to write \"Man has 48 chromosomes\" 500 times on a classroom chalkboard. \"What did you tell the priest?\" she later asked Benz.\"I told him I lied, 500 times,\" the headstrong 15-year-old quipped. Benz jokes that his people skills have improved a little through the decades. Along with his passion and vision, they have served him well since late 2000, when he succeeded David G. Nathan, MD, as Dana-Farber president. The esteem and affection that Dana-Farber staff members have for Benz, who will step down from his position at the end of 2016, is genuine. During a period of dramatic change in the world of health care funding and delivery, a focus on Dana-Farber' s multiple missions of research, care, and training the next generation of leaders - along with the employ- ees devoted to delivering them - has remained his top priority. \"Ed embodies our mission, and provides its heart and soul,\" says Craig Bunnell, MD, MPH, chief medical officer, Dana-Farber. \"His commitment is evident to everyone, shining through when you see him speak or even when you read his emails. He has a passion about the organization and what we do here that sets the tone for all of us.\"Dana-Farber President and CEO Edward J. Benz Jr., MD, steps down after an era of innovation and expansion 27 www.dana-farber.org 28 Paths of Progress 2016 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute A Return to His Roots Taking the reins at Dana- Farber marked a homecoming for Benz, who in the 1970s had been President Emeritus Nathan' s student - and later his colleague - at Harvard Medical School. Like his mentor, Benz emerged as a world-renowned hematologist, and led medical programs at Y ale, the University of Pittsburgh, and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. When Benz returned to Bos- ton' s Longwood Medical Area in 2000, he arrived at a Dana-Farber poised for dramatic growth. After a half-century during which its facilities remained within shout- ing distance of founder Sidney Farber' s original basement labora- tory at Boston Children' s Hospi- tal, Dana-Farber expanded during Benz' s tenure to include several campuses across the city, as well as satellite facilities and hospital partnerships throughout New England, and abroad. \"As cancer care has evolved, Community outreach has been important to Benz, including inspiring the next generation of Dana-Farber physicians, researchers, and support staff. cons and works to develop win- win solutions. He fosters col- laboration. He possesses all of the skills that are required to be a highly effective leader in our complex industry.\" Dana-Farber' s rising stature during Benz' s tenure supports this view. Its regional reputation long since established, the organiza- tion is now annually recognized as among the top cancer centers in the United States. In 2015, U.S. News and World Report ranked Dana-Farber/Boston Children' s as the nation' s leading pediatric cancer program for the second straight year, while the adult program at DF/BWCC was the highest-ranked in New England for the 15th consecutive time - as well as fourth nationwide. \"He has not only expanded the resources - both physical and intellectual - but has also left us in as solid a position as possible,\" says his predecessor, Nathan. \"It' s hard to find someone equal parts clinician and scientist, but Ed is that while also possessing a keen understanding of management. It' s been a superb combination for us.\" Bridge Builder The bridges to Dana-Farber' s inpatient partners now extend from gleaming new facilities built during Benz' s administration, the Y awkey Center for Cancer Care and a completely refurbished Jimmy Fund Clinic. Their design and construction included input not only from caregivers and administrative staff, but also from adult and pediatric Patient and Ed has adapted our organization to thrive in new settings while maintaining the core of what we do so uniquely well,\" says Elizabeth Liebow, the Institute' s senior vice president of Business Development, Clinical Planning, and Community Site Operations. \"Under his leadership, we have evolved our delivery of services to be more convenient and acces- sible for patients and their fami-lies - including treatment options closer to their homes.\" Back on its main campus, while Dana-Farber has remained an outpatient facility, its joint ven- tures with neighboring Longwood hospitals - Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women' s Cancer Center (DF/ BWCC) and Dana-Farber/Bos- ton Children' s Cancer and Blood Disorders Center - have grown and flourished. \"Ed is a clear, careful, logi- cal thinker who listens,\" says Elizabeth Nabel, MD, president, Brigham and Women' s Health Care. \"He weighs the pros and 29 www.dana-farber.org Leadership skills, warmth, and foresight make Benz a valued mentor, committed to building a staff that is diverse in background and skills. Family Advisory Councils, which have had a strong voice at Dana- Farber throughout Benz' s tenure. Indeed, many organizations look to Dana-Farber as a leader in patient-centered care. \"He' s always talked about that inclusiveness of patients and families in thinking, planning, organizational strategy, managing risk and safety, and quality,\" says Patricia Reid Ponte, RN, DNSc, FAAN, senior vice president for Patient Care Services and chief nursing officer at Dana- Farber. \"As a physician or a leader of a team, you need that inclusive approach to planning and decision-making.\" Throughout his time as presi- dent, Benz has championed basic science research at the Institute. Early on, he recognized that genomics - the study of the complete set of DNA within cells - would become a cornerstone of cancer research. He supported Dana-Farber' s alliance with the Broad Institute of MIT and Har - vard, giving Dana-Farber scien-tists access to some of the most advanced technology for tracking the links between genetic muta- tions and cancer. Benz also spearheaded Dana- Farber' s investment in cancer chemical biology, making the Institute, for the first time, a center for the development of compounds that can become new targeted therapies for cancer, in- cluding a class of drugs designed to destroy, rather than merely block, cancer-related proteins in cells. Benz' s influence also ex- tended to the establishment of In- tegrated Research Centers, which provide collaboration technology platforms to researchers across the Institute, from laboratory scientists to those who translate basic science advances into new therapies for patients. Among these centers is the Lurie Fam- ily Imaging Center, which uses advanced technology to detect cancer and evaluate how well it responds to potential treatments. A key component of Benz' s vision of Dana-Farber' s role in the early development of new cancer drugs is the Robert and Ren\u00e9e Belfer Center for Applied Cancer Science, opened in 2006. The Belfer Center serves as a magnet for collaborations between Dana-Farber scientists and phar - maceutical companies, speeding the process by which promising scientific leads are converted into new and better therapies. A physician-scientist by train- ing, Benz also has a strong grasp of melding research with clinical care. Dana-Farber is a leader in the development of clinical tri- als, the ultimate embodiment of the \"bench-to-bedside\" concept embraced by Institute founder Sidney Farber, MD. The number of clinical trials per year has steadily increased. And, with the leadership of Chief Scientific Officer Barrett Rollins, MD, PhD, and in close collaboration with Brigham and Women' s Hospital \"he has not only expanded the resources ... but has left us in as solid a position as possible.\" - David G. Nathan, MD, president emeritus 30 Paths of Progress 2016 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Boston Children' s Hospital, Benz helped launch Profile, one of the nation' s most comprehen- sive precision cancer medicine research initiatives. Benz has also been a strong advocate for growing both areas of the Institute. In an era of de- creased federal funding for cancer research, he moved quickly on the opportunity to make Dana-Farber the lead tenant in the brand-new Longwood Center, with portions of five floors dedicated to the Linde Family Program in Clini- cal Chemical Biology, the Blais Proteomics Center, and programs in computational biology and biostatistics. Located just across the street from Dana-Farber' s main campus, the space - which opened in 2015 - also houses the Belfer Center, a fully integrated, collaborative cancer research cen-ter focused on translating today' s innovative oncology research into tomorrow' s treatments. Assuring that people from all backgrounds have the ability to benefit from such developments as employees or patients, Benz focused on establishing initiatives to increase the number of women and minority faculty and managers at Dana-Farber. Further programs focused on eliminating racial, eth- nic, and socioeconomic disparities in cancer prevention, outcomes, and care. In 2013, Dana-Farber partnered with Whittier Street Health Center to establish a cancer clinic in Boston' s Roxbury neighborhood. Thought to be the first dedicated cancer clinic in a community health center, it was named for Benz to honor his com-mitment to making it a reality. \"In reaching out to communi- ties that have not previously had access to our resources, he had the ability to be proactive rather than reactive,\" says Karen Burns White, MS, deputy associate director of the Initiative to Elimi- nate Cancer Disparities. Adds Christopher Lathan, MD, MS, MPH, faculty director for Can- cer Care Equity, \"Our disparities program would not exist, on many levels, without his involvement. Ed' s compassion and intelligence allow him to understand patients from all socioeconomic and racial backgrounds.\" This commitment has extended into some of the world' s poorest locales. The Center for Global Cancer Medicine at Dana-Farber provides care, education, new facilities, and research expertise to the people of Rwanda and Haiti - in many cases the first cancer treatment these individuals have ever received. Always on the Move All these developments have meant many more people coming to Dana-Farber for work or care. Staff size tripled during Benz' s tenure to more than 4,000 full- time staff, as did patient volume, and fundraising became another hallmark of the Benz presidency. A $1 billion capital campaign during his tenure, the first ever at a New England hospital, helped to build the Y awkey Center, and giving remained strong even dur - ing a global economic downturn.

The already-palpable power of Dana-Farber' s Jimmy Fund expanded through the grow- ing appeal of iconic events like the WEEI/NESN Jimmy Fund Radio-Telethon and Jimmy Fund Scooper Bowl \u00ae, and through the dedication of fundraising part- ners like the Pan-Mass Chal- lenge bike-a-thon. Benz not only touted these staples on the New England fundraising calendar, he also participated in them himself - even when doing so took some multitasking. \"I can remember him complet- ing the Boston Marathon\u00ae Jimmy Fund Walk one warm September afternoon, and then going into the Fairmount Copley Plaza right near the finish line,\" recalls Robert J. Mayer, MD, faculty vice president for Academic Affairs. \"He took a quick shower, grabbed a sports coat he had left there, strode into the last part of the postgraduate course we were presenting to a ballroom full of oncologists and hematologists, and gave a terrific lecture.\" This speaks to another of Benz' s strengths - the ability to help others gain skills and stature by his example. \"Ed has been a tremendous mentor for me,\" says Rollins. \"He has helped me learn how to guide people so that they work together to go in a certain direction.\" Adds Deborah Hicks, senior vice president for Human Resources, \"He cares as deeply about every individual as he does about the whole institution.\" Now, Benz will prepare to let others take the lead. In addition to his Dana-Farber title, he has simultaneously held positions as CEO of Dana-Farber/Partners Cancer Care; director and prin- cipal investigator of the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center, trustee of Dana-Farber/Children' s Hospital Cancer Care, and the Richard and Susan Smith Profes- sor of Medicine at Harvard Medi- cal School. He will vacate all of these roles and return full-time to his clinical and research work, as well as his teaching position as a professor of medicine, pediat- rics, and genetics on the Harvard Medical School faculty. \"I'm looking forward to having a little more time to be a hema-tologist, which is what I set out to be when I was doing my training in medical school and fell in love with the field,\" Benz says. Having served in a consult- ing role during the search for his successor, he is looking forward to \"someone else being the boss.\" A more flexible schedule will mean more time for non-work- related travel with his wife, Peggy Vettesse, PhD, RN, a nurse leader at Dana-Farber throughout her husband' s tenure. Their four children and eight grandchildren will also keep him busy, as will playing whatever sport is in season and rooting for his beloved Pittsburgh Steelers. \"Of all the fabulous jobs that I have been lucky to have, this one has definitely been the best,\" adds Benz. \"I remain energized about the great work that we do, and remain as optimistic as ever about our future.\"Bonds formed with colleagues like Barrett Rollins, MD, PhD (left photo), and supporters like Victoria Reggie Kennedy and Trustee Richard A. Smith (right photo) have been vital to Benz's success. 32 Paths of Progress 2016 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute \"[HAVING] p AllIA tIVe cAre, psycHosocIAl oNcoloGy, ANd socIAl work All uNder oNe roof exIsts NowHere else.\" WHY I WORK HERE James Tulsky, MD, is comfortable where most doctors aren't. While some may, understand- ably, shy away from talking about the challenges of serious illness, the new chair of Dana-Farber' s Psy- chosocial Oncology and Palliative Care department recognizes that these conversations are some of the most important a doctor and patient will ever have. He also knows that Dana-Farber is uniquely posi-tioned to address patient values throughout treatment and at the end of life. \"The fact that we have palliative care, psychosocial oncology, and social work all under one roof exists nowhere else,\" says Tulsky of his department' s struc- ture. \"It allows us to think very carefully about what each of these disciplines has to contribute to the care of people with cancer.\" Tulsky, who joined Dana-Farber in September 2015, is dedicated to helping providers throughout the Institute feel as comfortable as he is with con- versations about patients' values and goals. This specific interest in communication between doctors and patients stems from an incident he witnessed as a resident, when an emergency room physician asked the wife of a man with widespread metastatic lung cancer, \"Do you want us to do everything for your husband?\" The wife answered in the way any good spouse would, Tulsky remembers, with, \"Y es, of course.\" The man, who had been actively dying at home, was then intubated, rather than made comfort-able, and died overnight. \"An incredible spark went off for me about the power of words, and that how we craft our language makes all the difference in the world,\" Tulsky says. That interest in the intersection of medicine and the humanities stayed with him. In 1995, Tulsky joined the Project on Death in America Faculty Scholars Program, led by Susan Block, MD, his predecessor at Dana-Farber. \"The people in that pro-gram ended up creating what has become academic palliative care,\" he recalls. Later, to help oncologists better communicate with patients and their loved ones, Tulsky co-founded the nonprofit VitalTalk. \"Most doctors have not received formal training in this,\" Tulsky explains. \"These conversations bring up a lot of emotions, not only for patients, but also for oncologists, who fear taking away the patient' s hope or harming their relationship with the patient; it some- times appears easier to avoid it.\" In 2016, Tulsky will introduce his VitalTalk curricu- lum, which includes practicing communication skills with simulated patients, to Dana-Farber oncology fel- lows for the first time. He also hopes to train several faculty members to become VitalTalk facilitators, to further develop training opportunities across the Insti- tute and its affiliates. \"We talk about personalized medicine often here, which is scientifically amazing and incredibly benefi- cial to patients. But let' s provide personalized medi- cine that matches not only people' s genomes, but also their personalities, values, and goals.\"James Tulsky, MD By shANNoN WATTErsoN James Tulsky, MD, helps patients better communicate with their loved ones. 33 www.dana-farber.org WHAT I KNOW Laura Greco We all know what to expect after a car accident: insurance claims, whiplash, maybe a broken bone. A cancer diagnosis, though? Not so common. For 40-year-old Laura Greco, this is what happened after a collision on a snowy day in 2015. If I hadn't been in the car accident, I wouldn't have found the cancer as early. I was hit by an SUV while driving home. My 6-year-old complained of injury to his arm, so we went via ambulance to the hospital. As the adrenaline wore off, I started to feel whiplash pains, so I had a trauma scan. They found nothing significant relating to my pain, but told me, casually, that I might want to check out the mass in my lung. \"We see stuff in lungs all the time,\" the physician' s assistant informed me. \"Y ou've never smoked, right?\" \"Right, and I'm only 40!\" I replied. A few days later, the doctor called to tell me that I needed to get the mass in my lung biopsied right away. Lung cancer isn't just for smokers. The biopsy results showed it was non-small cell cancer, adenocarcinoma. I had stage 3A cancer. I was in complete disbelief. Doesn't someone with cancer feel sick? I felt great! Like so many others, I believed the anti-smoking campaigns. I thought that if you never smoked, you could cross lung cancer off your worry list. Turns out, all you need is lungs. The risk to nonsmokers should be clearer.At the same time I was being diagnosed, I was in New Y ork, where I was bombarded with a big public service campaign about a young man who died of lung cancer with the tagline \"if only I didn't pick up that first cigarette.\" I screamed and cried, because I never picked up that first cigarette. I called the As told to sTAcEy cuNNINGToNdepartment behind the campaign, and explained that not picking up a cigarette will prevent many instances of lung cancer, but it won't prevent all cases. In fact, the ad campaign reinforces the false notion that \"no smoking means no cancer.\" The face of lung cancer is changing. According to recent studies, the face of lung cancer is getting younger, and involving more never-smokers. Y et, many in the medical community don't acknowledge this new reality. Lung cancer in never- smokers is the sixth-leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. That' s hardly rare. It' s time for lung cancer to be recognized as the indiscriminate killer that it is. Laura Greco was diagnosed with lung cancer after a car accident brought her to the emergency room.\"'If oNly I dIdN 't pIck up tHA t fIrst cIGArette.'

Consistently ranked one of the top cancer centers in the country by U.S. News & World Report, Dana-Farber is a founding member of the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center, which is one of 45 nationally designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers. As a teaching affiliate of Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber is also one of 20 federal Centers for AIDS Research in the United States. It has earned \"Magnet\" status for excellence in nursing and is a QOPI \u00ae Certified Practice. Dana-Farber partners with Brigham and Women' s Hospital to deliver care for adults with cancer through Dana-Farber/ Brigham and Women' s Cancer Center. It also has a long- standing alliance with Boston Children' s Hospital to care for pediatric cancer patients through Dana-Farber/Boston Children' s Cancer and Blood Disorders Center. Bringing together the strengths of three world-class institutions, these partnerships provide an exceptional level of care for cancer patients and their families. The Jimmy Fund (www.JimmyFund.org) solely supports Dana-Farber, raising funds for adult and pediatric cancer care and research to improve the chances of survival for can- cer patients around the world. It is the official charity of the Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association, the Pan-Massa- chusetts Challenge, and the Variety Children' s Charity of New England. Since 1948, the generosity of millions of people has helped the Jimmy Fund save countless lives and reduce the burden of cancer for patients and families worldwide.

The positive results came during a year when the Institute converted its clinical and revenue-cycle software platform to Epic Systems. This new set of applications will enhance safety features, allow critical access to data, and bring efficiencies to our workflows. In anticipation of the expected challenges and costs related to the conversion, we budgeted for a lower-than-typical operating margin of approxi- mately $12 million, or 1 percent. We achieved an operating margin of $22 million, or roughly 1.8 percent. Non-operating revenue was negatively affected by overall conditions in the investment markets, which returned (2.0) percent for the fiscal year. The result was a deficit of revenues over expenses of $2.5 million. Patient care revenue increased by 13.8 percent across the Institute, includ- ing the main Boston campus, our regional satellite centers, and our physician practice offices, continuing the trend of the last several years. Thanks to the ongoing support of our donors, it was an outstanding year for fundraising, which saw a 13.4 percent increase in unrestricted giving. Research revenues increased by 11 percent during fiscal year 2015, reflecting strong growth from all funding sources. This growth was seen at the federal level following several years of reductions in funding from the National Institutes of Health, as well as from our non-government and commercial sponsors, and in the increased use of gifts. Our investments in research during 2015 continue to position us well for the future. The Longwood Center opened and investigators and their staff began moving into this state-of-the-art laboratory facility in January 2015. We recently committed to leasing additional space within the Longwood Cen-ter for purposes of housing our animal facility, which will move from its cur - rent home in the Smith Building during late calendar year 2016. Our increased footprint in the Longwood Center reflects our commitment to best-in-class scientific advancements. On the clinical side, fiscal year 2015 marked the first full year of operations at our newest regional satellite, at St. Elizabeth' s Medical Center in Boston, as well as our physician medical oncology practice (Dana-Farber Community Cancer Care), which allows us to provide community oncology in a physician practice setting. Management, faculty, and staff throughout Dana-Farber - guided by the oversight of several committees of our Board of Trustees - worked diligently to achieve these results. We are grateful to them and also to the many donors and friends of Dana-Farber, who continue to demonstrate their commitment to the organization with their valuable knowledge and generous contributions. We are proud of all of these efforts and thankful for this strong and ongoing support.A Message from Chief Financial Officer Michael Reney 36 Annual Report 2015 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute dAnA-FA Rb eR cAn c e R In s t It u t e In c.
