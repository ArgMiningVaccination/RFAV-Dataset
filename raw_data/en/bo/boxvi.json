While it is one of many services available at your local spa or salon, deep tissue massage offers many benefits that support and maintain good health on many levels. When combined with other types of treatment, it can enhance and support the healing process, strengthening the body and relaxing the mind. In essence, it ties the treatment options together and provides a healing response that is long-lasting and very effective. Massage Therapy Offers More than Just Relaxation There are several types of massage. Swedish is gentle and relaxing. Deep tissue massage goes further beneath the surface. The therapist manipulates the soft tissues on a deeper level. This breaks up any deposits and stretches the muscle fibers, improving flexibility and allowing toxins and contaminants to be flushed from the body. This improves circulation to the area and increases both flexibility and range of motion. Supports Chiropractic Adjustments Deep tissue massage strengthens the soft tissues of the body. Chiropractic adjustments restore balance to both the muscular and skeletal structures of the body. When combined, chiropractic adjustments and deep tissue massage work together, realigning the skeletal structure and then strengthening the soft tissues to hold the adjusted areas of the body in place. This enhances the healing process and supports the body's ability to repair itself naturally. The results are long-term pain relief and reduced inflammation and stiffness. Maintenance Care Maintenance care normally involves regular chiropractic care and deep tissue massage. Establishing a maintenance care routine is the best way to keep the body strong and resilient after recovering from an injury or illness.
