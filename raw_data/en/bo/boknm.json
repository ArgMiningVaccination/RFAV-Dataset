Homologous--similar in appearance, structure, or function; usually applied to the same species. Host--an organism harboring an infection (e.g. bacteria or virus). Immunity--natural or acquired resistance to infectious disease by virtue of previous exposure to the causative organism. Immunity may be partial or complete, long-lasting or temporary.

Immunogenic--capable of provoking an immune response. Immunosuppression--suppression of immune response. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria--the medical or social characteristics on the basis of which individuals or groups may be included or excluded from participating in clinical trials. Informed Consent--the process by which prospective subjects agree voluntarily, and based on information about risks and benefits, as well as alternatives, to participate in a clinical research experiment. Inoculate--to introduce the agent of a disease or other antigenic material into the blood for preventive, cura#ve, or experimental purposes. IRB--institutional review board, an independent ethical review panel designated to review trial protocols prior to their commencement, to ensure that the rights of human subjects are being adequately protected.

NIAID--National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, headquartered in Bethesda, Md., and an agency of the National Institutes of Health. The institute supports research on AIDS, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases as well as allergies and immunology. NIH--National Institutes of Health, headquartered in Bethesda, Md., an agency of the U.S. Public Health Service, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Opportunistic Infection--in an immunocompromised person, an infectious disease caused by an organism that generally would be nonpathogenic in an immune-competent host. Parenteral--involving introduction into the bloodstream. Pathogen--any virus, microorganism, or other substance causing disease. Peptide--chain of two or more amino acids. Proteins are large peptides. Phase I--the first clinical studies of a drug or vaccine in humans. Designed to evaluate shortterm toxicity (adverse reactions) at different dose levels. Involves a small number of healthy (or, in the study of vaccines, low-risk) volunteers, for a relatively short period of time. Phase H--larger clinical trials involving greater numbers of volunteers, some of whom may be ill (or, in the study of vaccines, at higher risk for infection). Phase H trials follow the demonstration of preliminary safety through Phase I studies, and gather longer-term safety and dosage data. Phase II studies may suggest efficacy but do not have the statistical power to be conclusive. Phase llI--large, well-controlled clinical trials designed to demonstrate the efficacy of a drug or vaccine in a.atistically meaningful manner. Phase III trials also confirm preliminary Phase I and II safety data and, if successful, are used to justify licensure. Placebo--an inactive substance administered to a group of study participants (an \"arm\" of the trial) who serve as a control group, to provide a basis of comparison with those being administered the experimental drug or vaccine.
