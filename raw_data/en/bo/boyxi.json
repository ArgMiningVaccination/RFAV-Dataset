Naturology has a multidimensional view of the human being and as such considers physical, emotional, mental and spiritual aspects. It is based across a range of 4 different therapeutic systems: Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ayurvedic Medicine, Shamanism and Anthroposophy. The natural therapeutic practices used are: Aromatherapy, Colourlight Therapy, Herbalism, Bach Flowers, Massage, Reflexology, Art Therapy, Meditation, Nutritional Advice and Physical and Breathing practices. The therapeutic relationship is built on mutual trust and respect. Within the sessions, the client has space to safely explore their experiences without fear of judgment. The focus of each session is to build self-awareness and self-responsibility. The sessions will help clients to have a better understanding of themselves and the effect their choices have on their health and relationships. From the interaction in the present moment between therapist and client plus the awareness of the client's psychological and physical needs, a therapeutic approach is created to address the problem or dis-ease. During the session, different natural techniques can be combined in order to enhance their benefits and make the experience unique to the person's specific needs. A session provides a pathway woven with natural therapies where transformation can happen. A space of nurturing and nourishing support. The aim of the practice is to stimulate a natural ability to heal yourself by using natural resources, so one can experience more balance, flow, growth and fulfilment.
