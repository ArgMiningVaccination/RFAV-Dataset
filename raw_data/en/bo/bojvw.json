However, few ever see their dream come to fruition. If you've ever wanted to write a book but don't know how or where to start or maybe you've started in the past but never got past the blank screen in front of you, I'll teach you how to get over your fear, doubts, and procrastination habits and get that first book done. Taking on a big project like this can be intimidating so I'll teach you a framework to break this down into small, reasonable, and realistic steps that you can use to make writing and publishing a book an achievable goal. You'll learn the \"anatomy\" of a book, how to get your ideas organized into a succinct roadmap, and how to overcome writer's block. Finally, I will show you how to approach the editing process, how to format your manuscript, how to design a cover, and how to self-publish on Amazon KDP; one of the biggest publishing platforms in the world. Note: This course focuses primarily on non-fiction books rather than fiction; however, I will share some tips on writing a novel. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Johns Hopkins Tuition Remission Policies Johns Hopkins alumni, staff, faculty and their spouse or domestic partners are eligible for tuition remission for Odyssey lifelong learning courses.

This course explores the origin and development of the Russian short story through works of four masters: Nikolai Gogol, Anton Chekhov, Isaac Babel, and Mikhail Zoshchenko. Each author occupies a stage in the development of Russian fiction. Gogol bridges the gap between Pushkin's romantic spirit and Dostoevsky's great novels. Chekhov draws from realism, popular culture, and the serialized novel to deliver the modern short story. Babel provides understated vignettes of the savagery of Russia's Civil War (1917-1922) and Zoshchenko subjects Stalin's tyranny to satire and humor. Students will read selected stories by each author in recent editions by the best translators. Assignments will include suggested films and visual material linked with the stories and their authors. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Johns Hopkins Tuition Remission Policies Johns Hopkins alumni, staff, faculty and their spouse or domestic partners are eligible for tuition remission for Odyssey lifelong learning courses.

Halifax is willing to stand on the edge of our experience and bear witness to all that transpires even in the most difficult of times. Her Buddhist ecumenical approach provides great benefit to people of all traditions. She has led the Upaya (Skillful Means) Zen Center in Santa Fe since 1990, a center involved with close Buddhist study and transformative social action. In order to explore Halifax's teachings more deeply within the context from which these teachings arose for her, we will use meditative practices and exercises in class that she describes in Being with Dying. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ Johns Hopkins Tuition Remission Policies Johns Hopkins alumni, staff, faculty and their spouse or domestic partners are eligible for tuition remission for Odyssey lifelong learning courses.

The ferries have been operating on a regular schedule for the most part, but there are days when one ferry is down due to maintenance, or the waits are longer than normal. We recommend checking the website schedule (the 'alerts' section will tell you if there is an alternate schedule or long wait time) or the WSDOT App, the morning of our wine tasting to plan your travel. Whidbey Island is a lovely place to visit! If you would rather not worry about ferry wait times and want to take full advantage of being on Whidbey Island, we recommend planning to arrive at least a couple of hours early to Whidbey Island and visiting the seaside town of Langley. There are plenty of restaurants and shops to explore by foot, and it is just a 15-minute drive from Dancing Fish Vineyards.

They all influenced Giacomo Puccini's Tosca (1900). We set the scene with an overview of Puccini's operas in the 1890s and the aesthetics of Italian verismo opera. We then explore the libretto's inspiration in an 1887 French play, La Tosca, that toured Italy with Bernhardt in the title role and Puccini in the audience\u2014ultimately shaping his operatic heroine. As a celebrated public figure making impossible choices in the blood-soaked world of Puccini's opera, Floria Tosca challenged conceptions of women, power, and public life in turn-of-the-century Italy. We trace these gendered contours in her music, with Maria Callas as our guide, and interpret her harrowing acts of violence through this lens. We also examine the opera's Napoleonic historical references in light of the social and political instability that surrounded Tosca's premiere, including bomb threats against the Teatro Costanzi in Rome. We conclude with in-depth discussion of music, libretto, and staging in several iconic scenes\u2014from Baron Scarpia's dastardly aria Vissi d'arte. ________________________________________________________________________________ Johns Hopkins Tuition Remission Policies Johns Hopkins alumni, staff, faculty and their spouse or domestic partners are eligible for tuition remission for Odyssey lifelong learning courses.

In the context of the Emancipation of the Russian serfs, he expands the realist novel to question the very meaning of historical inquiry. Although the work is 150 years old, it remains live to readers globally and especially in Russian-speaking countries. Soldiers of the Russian and Ukrainian armies, and even the convicts of Prigozhin's forces, carry Pierre, Andrei, Natasha, and the full caste into the trenches thanks to their high school lessons in literature. In this course we will read Richard Pevear's and Larissa Volokhonsky's superb translation and watch the British TV award-winning 2016 adaption directed by Tom Harper. The six scheduled lectures will treat the context in which Tolstoy wrote the novel and expected it to be understood. There are no written assignments and there will be time to discuss the text and the films. __________________________________________________________________________________ Johns Hopkins Tuition Remission Policies Johns Hopkins alumni, staff, faculty and their spouse or domestic partners are eligible for tuition remission for Odyssey lifelong learning courses.

This decision opened the door for \"dark money\" to support candidates through \"super PACS\" that can now spend whatever they want to influence the political process without the public knowing the source or the amount of the funding. Although the impact of Citizens United remains unabated, with more money being spent by Super PACs in each succeeding election, there are recent efforts among states and in Congress to amend the Constitution in order to overturn this verdict. This session will examine the Citizens United decision and discuss subsequent cases interpreting it, and then explore the continuing and intensifying impact the case has had on efforts to pass campaign finance reform. Robert Rubinson, J.D., New York University, is the Gilbert A. Holmes Professor of Clinical Theory and Practice at the University of Baltimore School of Law. He has served as Associate Dean for Experiential Education and is currently the Director of the Mediation Clinic for Families.

He is the recipient of the President's Faculty Award and the Award for Outstanding Teaching.

The Katz decision set a precedent for treating cybercrimes according to the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits \"unreasonable searches and seizures\" by the government and protects legitimate expectations of privacy. In 1967\u2014long before the Internet\u2014the Supreme Court established a general test to determine if the government's online activity is a \"search\"; the government's conduct must offend the person's subjective expectation of privacy, an expectation that must \"be one that society is prepared to recognize as 'reasonable'.\" Eventually, courts had to apply that definition to cybercrimes cases. Two major decisions, both in 2014, reflect that application; the Supreme Court ruled that warrantless searches of cell phones\u2014likened to minicomputers with large storage capacities that contain private details like photographs, emails, and other content\u2014are illegal, and a lower court held that a defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy regarding emails and online chat sessions, even though his Internet provider's usage policies expressed warnings about monitoring online activity. We'll examine police procedures that must be followed before, during, and after a search and seizure and what impact such law enforcement limitations have on using cyber technologies for surveillance and wiretapping. Mark Duke, an Associate Professor of Cyber Security at the National Defense University who holds many professional certifications, is currently pursuing his Ph.D. in Engineering Management and Systems Engineering at the George Washington University, where he also teaches in the School of Engineering and Applied Science. He served over 28 years in the U.S. Army's Signal Corps Communication and Electronics division and was a Joint Duty Officer with the National Security Agency as an Information Systems Security Engineer while supporting the Defense Information Systems Agency, National Security Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, Central Intelligence Agency, Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Staff, and many other organizations within both the U.S. Intelligence Community and non-DoD agencies. -- 500 -- Katz v United States -- 0 -- 0 Session 2: Katz v United States (1967) 2023-10-28 -- 1 -- 00 -- PM -- 2023-10-28 -- 2 -- 30 -- PM -- Virtual -- -- Zoom -- NA -- -- USA -- 0 -- Decided 55 years ago, Terry v. Ohio and the cases based upon and interpreting the Supreme Court's opinion in Terry remain the seminal judicial approach to the investigation of street crime based on the stop and frisk model of policing. The controversy that has raged about the various forms of stop and frisk policing existed before Terry and is brought home to us frequently today in the interactions between police officers investigating criminal activity and the public they serve. This class will examine what the police must know before they engage in a Terry type seizure and what they are permitted to do once that seizure takes place. It will also explore the overall impact of stop and frisk policing on crime. Steven P. Grossman, J.D. Brooklyn Law School, LL.M. New York University, is the Dean Julius Isaacson Professor Emeritus at the University of Baltimore School of Law. He has also been a prosecutor in New York City and a criminal defense lawyer.

Its efforts include making it more difficult for the Court to overturn Knesset (the Israeli Parliament) rulings and increasing the power of the ruling coalition to determine who gets appointed to the Court. These initiatives have produced huge demonstrations, the refusal of thousands to continue their reserve duty in the Israeli military, and the threatened flight of the best and brightest members of Israeli society. At the root of the opposition is the belief that these moves threaten to undermine Israeli democracy by undermining the Court, arguably the most important guardian of individual rights in a country without a constitution or many of the other checks and balances seen in Western states. In response, the Netanyahu coalition asserts it is only trying to express the will of the majority in attempting to reign in a Court that has exceeded its mandate. This session will consider why these efforts to reform the Court are being carried out, whether they will succeed, and the subsequent implications for Israel and, by extension, the United States if these decisions are permanent. Steven R. David, Ph.D., Harvard University, is a Professor of Political Science and International Relations at the Johns Hopkins University. He has written several books and numerous articles focusing on international security issues, including politics in the Middle East. At JHU, he teaches a course, \"Does Israel Have A Future?\" which examines threats to Israel's existence from Biblical times to the present. He is the author of Catastrophic Consequences (the Johns Hopkins University Press) and is currently working on a book examining existential threats to modern Israel using the history of ancient Israel specifically and the record of state death in general to provide insights into the dangers that modern Israel faces today. -- 500 -- Israeli Efforts at Judicial Overhaul -- 0 -- 0 Session 4: Israel's Efforts at Judicial Overhaul\u2014Why All the Fuss?

Is it when a business owner or entrepreneur cuts corners, hoping to make billions and not get caught? Or when a football player refuses to retire, knowing that he might suffer traumatic brain injuries that will turn him into a vegetable in middle age, after his knees have already given out for good? What about the politician who hooks his wagon to a dubious president, only to be indicted for something he wishes he hadn't done? Of course, it's all these instances and more, but the classic treatment of the \"bargain\" is Goethe's Faust, one of the great and lasting works of literature that far too few people know and read today. This course sets out to remedy that deficit by guiding you through Part One of Goethe's weird, funny, fabulous, and still timely play. _______________________________________________________________________________ Johns Hopkins Tuition Remission Policies Johns Hopkins alumni, staff, faculty and their spouse or domestic partners are eligible for tuition remission for Odyssey lifelong learning courses.

In this projector-driven course, we will review and discuss the work of such B&W masters as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Ralph Gibson, Ray K. Metzker, W. Eugene Smith, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Alfred Eisenstaedt, Arnold Newman, Alan Schaller, Richard Avedon, Walker Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz, Aaron Siskind, Garry Winogrand, and Diane Arbus as we wrestle with the question: what makes a great B&W photograph? Focusing on tone, texture, form, point of view, visual metaphor, narrative and the like, we'll identify the elements that comprise a fine-art B&W image, all toward one end: to help you refine both your eye and craft as you shape your own special vision. (Our emphasis on composition also will help those interested in refining their color photography.) In the latter part of the course students will be encouraged but not required to show their own work. Please take note: portions of this course overlap with the professor's classic street photography course, albeit often (though not always) with a different emphasis. skill level: all levels, from beginner to advanced. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Johns Hopkins Tuition Remission Policies Johns Hopkins alumni, staff, faculty and their spouse or domestic partners are eligible for tuition remission for Odyssey lifelong learning courses.

In particular the years between 1914 and the 1950s brought one world-historical catastrophe after another, including the First World War, the Russian Revolution, the Great Depression, the rise of fascism in Italy and Germany, the Soviet Stalinist dictatorship, the Spanish Civil War, the Second World War, and the advent of the global Cold War. This Odyssey course explores the interaction of these momentous events with the cultural arts. We will discuss how the work of the greatest writers, artists, musicians, architects, filmmakers, and philosophers during this extraordinary forty-year period reflected their times. We will pay particular attention to the historical relation between art and politics in the totalitarian regimes of Germany under Hitler, the Soviet Union under Stalin, Italy under Mussolini, and Spain under Franco. We will look at both the art that opposed and supported these political regimes. In addition to learning about some of the greatest works of art and thought in the twentieth-century, the course will be a case study in an intriguing human phenomenon: how times of intense human tumult and trauma can also be periods of great cultural creatively and and intellectual accomplishment. ____________________________________________________________________________________________ Johns Hopkins Tuition Remission Policies Johns Hopkins alumni, staff, faculty and their spouse or domestic partners are eligible for tuition remission for Odyssey lifelong learning courses.

However, few ever see their dream come to fruition. If you've ever wanted to write a book but don't know how or where to start or maybe you've started in the past but never got past the blank screen in front of you, I'll teach you how to get over your fear, doubts, and procrastination habits and get that first book done. Taking on a big project like this can be intimidating so I'll teach you a framework to break this down into small, reasonable, and realistic steps that you can use to make writing and publishing a book an achievable goal. You'll learn the \"anatomy\" of a book, how to get your ideas organized into a succinct roadmap, and how to overcome writer's block. Finally, I will show you how to approach the editing process, how to format your manuscript, how to design a cover, and how to self-publish on Amazon KDP; one of the biggest publishing platforms in the world. Note: This course focuses primarily on non-fiction books rather than fiction; however, I will share some tips on writing a novel. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Johns Hopkins Tuition Remission Policies Johns Hopkins alumni, staff, faculty and their spouse or domestic partners are eligible for tuition remission for Odyssey lifelong learning courses.

From the early science fiction film Metropolis to the blockbuster Ex Machina, movies have long grappled with the potential dangers and benefits of AI. This course will examine a variety of films that explore different aspects of AI ethics, including the following: The potential for AI to lead to job displacement and economic inequality The ethical implications of creating artificial beings that are capable of feeling pain and suffering The dangers of AI becoming so intelligent that it surpasses human control, etc. The course will conclude with a discussion of the new wave of generative AI models, such as ChatGPT, and the ethical issues they raise. These models are capable of generating text, images, and code that is indistinguishable from human-created content. This raises the question of whether we should treat these models as creative beings with their own rights, or simply as tools that can be used for good or evil. This course is designed to be both informative and thought-provoking. It will provide students with a deeper understanding of the ethical challenges posed by AI, and it will encourage them to think critically about the future of this technology. __________________________________________________________________________________________ Johns Hopkins Tuition Remission Policies Johns Hopkins alumni, staff, faculty and their spouse or domestic partners are eligible for tuition remission for Odyssey lifelong learning courses.
