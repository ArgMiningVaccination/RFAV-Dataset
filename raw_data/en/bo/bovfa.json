What happens? Better yet, open the bottle of perfume your mother always wore. Memories flood in. Why? Our sense of smell has been vital to our survival. We, in 2018, may not rely on that sense as we once did, but think about it: sniffing food to see if it is still edible, smelling the smoke of an enemy's fire, detecting the healing properties of herbs through smell. Our minds are a creation of the inputs coming from our five senses, and our sense of smell has the power to both heal as well as awaken memories. No matter whether it is a plug-in air freshener spraying out a vanilla scent or bath bombs from [Scentsy Scent Circle](https://www.grainandgram.com/scentsy-scent-circle/) that smells like mangos, it can take us back in time and flood our brain with memories, both good and bad. Our Sense of Smell Triggers Memories So, what is happening? In a nutshell, the aroma is traveling directly to the hypothalamus, the part of our brains responsible for emotional responses. The aroma 'message' flows through the bodies limbic system into the hippocampus, the part of our brain responsible for memory. - You inhale tiny particles of essential oils from [aromatic plants](https://www.thegrowers-exchange.com/Aromatic_Herb_Plants_s/122.htm)or aromatherapy. - The olfactory receptors become stimulated in a process known as 'olfaction.' - The impulse is transmitted to the limbic system, the emotional center of our brain. - The limbic system is connected to areas of the brain linked to memory, circulation, endocrine glands that regulate hormone levels. A bit more of the Limbic System: considered to be the 'interface' between emotional states and memories. It is also the most primitive part of our brains and controls basic instincts, drives, needs, and avoidances. It also selects and transmits information between our short and long-term memory; hence the recollection of a distinct memory when smelling a particular fragrance. The Limbic System controls both. Endocrine System: the primary regulatory system in the body made up of glands that secrete hormones into the bloodstream. These hormones regulate many bodily functions including mood, as well as metabolism and growth. Autonomic Nervous System: also a primary system, it works on a level far below our 'awareness' and connects our brains to essential bodily functions including digestion, heart rate, respiration, and sexual responses. Aromatherapy & Healing So, for Aromatherapy proponents, the mind is a creation of all the inputs coming in from the five senses, and those nourishing smells awaken the innate healing powers in your mind. Whether inhaled through cotton balls, [reed diffusers](https://www.barbieinablender.org/best-reed-diffusers/), or applied directly to the skin, aromatherapy works to bring changes to our emotional and physical well-being.

Though many choose diffusers which can be bought from sites like [https://newgreenair.com/](https://newgreenair.com) and filled with essential oils in order to carry a far-reaching aroma with apparently great health benefits.
