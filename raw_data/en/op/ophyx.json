This means DHW staff who have been unable to attend work because of the vaccination requirements will no longer be prohibited from the workplace. Workforce Services will provide advice to managers about contacting staff to make plans for their return to the workplace. COVID-19 vaccination requirements for 'phase 1 healthcare settings' remain in place for public and private hospitals and ambulance services, meaning any DHW staff member who attends those sites for their work must comply with the mandatory vaccinations.
