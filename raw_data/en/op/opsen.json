This one-on-one service uses therapeutic singing bowls placed on the body to create a combination of tones and vibrations that produce a state of tranquility and act as a massage for the nervous system. How it works When relaxing through soothing sound and vibration, your body is affected on a cellular level, opening energy flow to move you back toward healthy alignment. Stress creates an unhealthy flow of energy, first appearing as low energy in your aura, and, later, as ill health, mentally and physically. Placing the therapeutic singing bowls directly on the body and creating a therapeutic sound wave vibration allows a practitioner to engage with the client physically and energetically. The practitioner generates a vibration on the singing bowls, which creates physical vibration throughout your body. As the bowls focus on the physical connection, the practitioner focuses on spiritual and energetic connections. How it helps The benefits of vibrational sound therapy are numerous. Vibrational sound therapy can: - Reduce stress - Reduce pain - Ease blockages and tension - Reduce depression - Improve sleep - Boost creativity - Improve concentration - Balance energy fields (aura) and chakras - Lower blood pressure "}
