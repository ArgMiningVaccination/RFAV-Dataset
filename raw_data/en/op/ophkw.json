As such, the AMA will distribute the modules to the following parties: (1) State medical associations (2) State medical boards (3) National medical specialty societies (4) National medical organizations In line with the express purpose of the modules being governmentally directed advocacy, it will not be the policy of the AMA to provide the modules to individual physicians. Organizations supplied with the module shall mirror the intent, purpose and standards of the AMA distribution guidelines. 4 Scope of Practice Data Series: Naturopaths I. OverviewThe American Medical Association (AMA) Advocacy Resource Center has created this information module on naturopaths to serve as a resource for state medical associations, national medical specialty societies and policymakers. This guide is one of 10 separate modules collectively comprising the AMA Scope of Practice Data Series, each covering a specific nonphysician health care profession. Without a doubt, limited licensure providers play an integral role in the delivery of health care in this coun-try. Efficient delivery of care requires a team-based approach that cannot exist without inter-professional collaboration between physicians, nurses and other lim-ited licensure health care providers. With the appropri-ate education, training and licensing, such providers can and do provide safe and essential health care to patients. The health and safety of patients are threatened, how-ever, when limited licensure providers are permitted to perform services that are not commensurate with their education or training. Each year in nearly every state and at times on the federal level, limited licensure health care providers lobby legislatures and regulatory boards to expand their scope(s) of practice. While some scope expansions may be appropriate, others definitely are not. It is important, therefore, to be able to explain to legislators and regula-tors the limitations in the education and/or training of limited licensure health care providers that can result in substandard or potentially harmful care of patients. Those limitations are brought clearly into focus when compared with the comprehensiveness and depth of the medical education and training of physicians. Issues of access to qualified physicians in rural or under - served areas give limited licensure providers what, at first glance, seems to be a legitimate rationale for lobby-ing for expanded scope of practice. However, solutions to actual or perceived work force shortages simply can-not justify practice expansions that expose patients to unnecessary health risks. In November 2005 the AMA House of Delegates approved Resolution 814, which called for the study of the qualifications, education, academic requirements, licensure, certification, independent governance, ethi-cal standards, disciplinary processes and peer review of limited licensure health care providers. By surveying the type and frequency of bills introduced in state legis-latures, and in consultation with state medical associa-tions and national medical specialty societies, the AMA identified 10 distinct limited licensure professions that are currently seeking scope of practice expansions that may be potentially harmful to the public. Each module in the AMA Scope of Practice Data Series is intended to assist in educating policymakers on the qualifications of a particular limited licensure health care profession, as well as on the qualifications physi-cians possess that prepare them to accept the responsi-bility for full, unrestricted licensure to practice medicine in all its branches. It is within the framework of educa-tion and training that health care professionals are best prepared to deliver safe, quality care under legislatively authorized state scopes of practice. It is the AMA's intention that these Scope of Practice Data Series modules provide background information for state- and federal-based advocacy campaigns where the health and safety of patients may be threatened as a result of unwarranted scope-of-practice expansions sought by limited licensure providers.

Overview Disclaimer This module is intended for informational purposes only, may not be used in credentialing decisions of individual practitioners, and does not constitute a limitation or expansion of the lawful scope of practice applicable to practitioners in any state. The only content that the AMA endorses within this mo dule is its policies. All information gathered from outside sources does not reflect the official policy of the AMA. The American Medical Association (AMA) is pleased to offer this informative module to assist physicians in countering the advocacy efforts of naturopaths seek-ing licensure and/or expansion of their current scope of practice to include privileges or procedures unwarranted by their education and training. This module examines the background, education and training of those practitioners who have earned a doctor of naturopathy or doctor of medical naturopathy degree, and who refer to themselves as \"naturopathic physi-cians\" or \"naturopathic doctors.\" Through their state chapters and their national professional organization, the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians, these practitioners seek to establish licensure in the 50 states, as well as liberal prescribing authority, \"primary care physician\" status and, in many cases, mandated insurance coverage for services. This stands in contrast to the beliefs of \"traditional\" naturopaths\u2014providers of natural health care who do not seek state recognition or regulation through licensure. Naturopaths frequently argue that licensure allows patients the freedom to choose them as primary health care providers. At the same time they are looking to dis-tinguish themselves from and assert privileges over their colleagues, the traditional naturopaths. A wide schism separates these two factions, which have a long, docu-mented history of philosophical differences culminating in the divergence of the \"naturopathic physician\" (and the corresponding quest for state licensure) from the non-medical practice of traditional naturopathy. Currently, 14 states and the District of Columbia license naturopaths. However, naturopaths may practice without a license in states where naturopathy is not expressly prohibited. In a few such states, this has pro-voked concern over whether naturopathic practitioners treating patients should be subject to some sort of state regulation (in the form of limited licensure, certification or registration) as a mean to protect the public. Official legislative reports from several states have unearthed specific shortcomings in the education, training and competency testing of naturopaths, and several of these recommend against licensure for naturopaths.Naturopathy involves the application of natural (non-pharmaceutical and non-surgical) treatment modalities to encourage and facilitate the body's healing of itself. The practice of naturopathy involves the application of a number of healing systems or physical, nutritional or natural agent regimens. Common naturopathic care includes treatments of botanical medicine/herbology, conventional nutritional counseling, homeopathy, acu-puncture and/or traditional Chinese medicine, massage and manipulative bodywork, mind/body treatments, hydrotherapy, as well as physical treatments such as ozone therapy, air and light therapy, and ultraviolet, ultrasound and electro-stimulation therapies. Such treatment modalities are collectively known as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), and their usage has significantly increased in popularity within the last decade. In 1998 the federal govern-ment created the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), an arm of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to study the effi-cacy of CAM in the treatment of chronic and acute diseases. Its mission is to apply accepted scientific princi-ples to CAM by providing funding and grants to support CAM clinical trials and research, in order to objectively assess the efficacy of CAM treatments as compared to conventional medical treatments and placebo. Consumers use CAM as either a complete treatment or as an adjunct to conventional medical care. Typically categorized as therapies not widely taught in U.S. medical schools, proponents of CAM broadly extend its definition to include common patient self-help strategies such as low-fat, low-sodium diets, stretching and exercise, daily vitamins and minerals, and prayer. In 2004 the NCCAM reported the results of a survey indicating that 36 percent of U.S. adults use some form of CAM. According to this survey, when megavitamin therapy and prayer specifically for health reasons are included in the definition of CAM, that number rose to 62 percent. 1 With such a broad defi- nition, it is little wonder CAM usage statistics are so high. For medical professionals and policymakers alike, the naturopathic profession's reluctance and/or inability to apply evidence-based principles and scientific study its II.

The use of CAM in the United States. http://nccam.nih.gov/news/camsurvey_fs1.htm#use. Retrieved December 5, 2007.treatment modalities is of great concern. For example, naturopaths' longstanding opposition to childhood vaccination has been demonstrated as recently as 1999, well after the remarkable decreases in childhood disease as a result of widespread vaccination had been docu-mented (see page 17 for more information). The mechanism of action and the efficacy of many naturopathic treatment modalities are not scientifically supported; yet practitioners of naturopathy continue to offer patients such treatments. Such behavior would not be tolerated in the practice of medicine. Care that is not premised on scientific evidence, and for which the patient is not informed of its experimental nature, would be considered unethical by the standards of the medical profession. Specifically, AMA Ethical Opinion E-3.01 states: It is unethical to engage in or to aid and abet in treatment which has no scientific basis and is dan-gerous, is calculated to deceive the patient by giving false hope, or which may cause the patient to delay in seeking proper care ... . 2 Some naturopathic treatments are blatantly unsafe and place the health of the patient at great risk for addi-tional health complications. The Textbook of Natural Medicine, 3 the foremost textbook used in schools of naturopathy, discusses naturopathic treatments that defy medical knowledge or, incredulously, omit discourse on the therapeutic benefits of pharmaceutical or surgi-cal interventions. For example, the second edition of the book called for St. John's wort in the treatment of HIV-positive individuals. Results of an NIH-funded study published in February 2000\u2014just months after the September 1999 release of the textbook\u2014found that St. John's wort interacts with protease inhibitors commonly used in treating patients with HIV and significantly decreases their concentration in the blood. Compared to medical school and residency training, a naturopathic education consists of relatively few con-tact hours of study on pharmacological treatment of disease, and provides virtually no clinical reinforcement of pharmaceutical intervention on patients during clini-cal rotations or optional post-graduate training. Most drugs are considered toxic by naturopaths, so alternative treatments are instead prescribed. One important com-ponent to consider in the debate over naturopath licen-sure is whether a practitioner with such limited expo-sure to pharmaceuticals can appropriately treat patients who take prescription medicines regularly or who would likely benefit from pharmacological intervention. When faced with the claims of naturopaths that the rig-ors of their education and licensing exams parallel those of physicians, legislators should recognize that graduates of campus-based, four-year naturopathic programs who have passed a standardized examination may demon-strate consistency from one naturopathic practitioner to the next. But that says nothing about the validity of their practice, which can be determined only by refer - ence to the laws of science or nature, and by rigorous testing of biologically plausible claims. 4 By failing to rigorously study all the treatments they provide, natur - opaths may place patients' safety at risk. According to a 2003 article in MedScape General Medi- cine, \"without licensing standards, individuals with little or no formal education may proclaim themselves naturopathic physicians without medical school educa-tion or board testing. ... [T]he clear message is that such licensing implies competence. There is, however, no evidence that 'educated' naturopaths\u2014i.e., the NDs or naturopathic 'physicians'\u2014are more competent than others. If anything, 'traditional naturopaths' (i.e., those who did not attend the 'approved' schools) may be less of a threat to public health because they do not pretend to be primary care physicians.\" 5 We hope the information contained in this module provides the tools necessary to help physicians pres-ent relevant facts in response to naturopaths' efforts to enact state licensure laws or expand their current scopes of practice. The AMA stands ready to assist state and specialty societies in their efforts to protect and preserve the health and safety of patients.

Naturopathy as a profession Definition(s) of naturopathy Webster's dictionary defines naturopathy as a system of treatment of disease that avoids drugs and surgery, and emphasizes the use of natural agents (such as air, water and herbs) and physical means (such as tissue manipulation and electrotherapy). 6 The National Cen- ter for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, a bureau of the National Institutes of Health, notes that naturopathy is a system of healing originating from Europe that views disease as a manifestation of altera-tions in the processes by which the body naturally heals itself. It emphasizes health restoration as well as disease treatment. The term naturopathy literally translates as \"nature disease.\" 7 Although the most visible professional organizations of naturopaths do not provide a formal definition of a naturopath, the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP) notes: [A] licensed naturopathic physician [ND] attends a four-year graduate level naturopathic medical school and is educated in all of the same basic sci-ences as an [MD] but also studies holistic and non-toxic approaches to therapy with a strong emphasis on disease prevention and optimizing wellness. In addition to a standard medical curriculum, the naturopathic physician is required to complete four years of training in clinical nutrition, acupuncture, homeopathic medicine, botanical medicine, psy-chology, and counseling (to encourage people to make lifestyle changes in support of their personal health). A naturopathic physician takes rigorous professional board exams so that he or she may be licensed by a state or jurisdiction as a primary care general practice physician. 8 This module will focus mostly upon the education, training and qualifications of naturopathic \"physicians,\" practitioners who attend four-year graduate schools of naturopathy and earn advanced degrees, as opposed to traditional naturopaths, who receive either apprentice-ship-style training or attend unaccredited naturopathy schools. Principles of naturopathy Classical naturopathy training is guided by the following six principles. Students in naturopathy schools world-wide are taught to abide by these principles. First do no harm (Primum no nocere) Illness is a purposeful process of the organism. The process of healing includes the generation of symp-toms that are, in fact, an expression of the life force attempting to heal itself. Therapeutic actions should be complementary to and synergistic with this healing process. The naturopathic physician's actions can support or antagonize the actions of the vis mediatrix naturae, the healing power of nature. Therefore, methods designed to suppress symptoms without removing the underlying causes are considered harmful and are to be avoided or minimized. The healing power of nature (Vis mediatrix naturae) The body has an inherent ability to establish, main- tain and restore health. The healing process is ordered and intelligent; nature heals through the response of the life force. The naturopathic physician's role is to facilitate this process, to identify and remove obsta-cles to health and recovery, and to establish or restore a healthy internal and external environment. Identify and treat the cause (Tolle causam) Illness does not occur without cause. Underlying causes of disease must be discovered and removed or treated before a person can recover completely from illness. Symptoms express the body's attempt to heal, but are not the cause of disease and, therefore, should not be suppressed by treatment. Causes may occur on many levels including the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. The naturopathic physician must evaluate fundamental underlying causes on all levels, directing treatment at root causes rather than at symptomatic expression. Heal the whole person (Tolle totum) Health and disease are conditions of the whole organ-ism, a whole involving the complex interaction of many factors. The naturopathic physician must treat 7 Scope of Practice Data Series: Naturopaths III. Naturopathy as a profession6. Web. Merriam-Webster online dictionary. www.merriam-webster.com.

The harmonious functioning of physical, mental, emotional and spiritual aspects is essential to the recovery from and the prevention of disease. This requires a comprehensive approach to diagnosis and treatment. The physician as teacher (Docere) A cooperative doctor-patient relationship has inher - ent therapeutic value. The naturopathic physician's major role is to educate and encourage the patient to take responsibility for their own health. The natur - opathic physician is a catalyst for healthful change, empowering and motivating the patient to assume responsibility. It is the patient, not the doctor, who ultimately creates/accomplishes healing. Teaching with hope, knowledge and understanding, the physi-cian acts to enable patients to heal. Prevention (Praevenire) The ultimate goal of any health care system should be prevention of disease. This is accomplished through education and the promotion of life habits that create good health. Naturopathic physicians learn to assess risk factors and to sharpen their deductive reasoning, and to understand the patient's circumstances. Appro-priate interventions are then sought to avoid further harm or risk to the patient. Building health works bet-ter and more surely than fighting disease. 9 General duties Naturopaths assess and diagnose patient conditions, devise treatment plans using natural, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), or conventional rem-edies, and provide counseling to patients. They typically focus on prevention and promoting the understanding that healing comes from within. 10,11,12Naturopathic practice may include the following diag-nostic and treatment modalities: clinical and laboratory diagnostic testing, including diagnostic radiology and other imaging techniques; hair, skin and nail analysis; iridology; nutritional counseling, dietetics and thera-peutic fasting; medicines of mineral, animal and botanical/herbal origin; hormones and biosynthetic agents; hygiene acupuncture; traditional Chinese medicine; psycho-therapy and counseling; minor surgery and naturopathic obstetrics (natural childbirth); naturopathic physical medicine including manipulation and massage; the use of hydrotherapies, heat, cold, ultrasound, ultraviolet light, magnetic and electrical fields; energy-based treat-ments, including reiki, biofeedback and therapeutic touch; and therapeutic exercise. 13,14 Brief history of the profession The modern form of naturopathy can be traced to 18th- and 19th-century healing systems in Germany and Austria. While naturopathy was being used in Europe during those time periods, it was not until the turn of the 20th century that the term surfaced in America. In 1902 Benedict Lust, a German immigrant, introduced naturopathy to the United States when he founded the American School of Naturopathy, which was later reorganized as the American Naturopathic Association in 1919. 15 Once naturopathy was introduced in the United States, naturopathic schools were established and large numbers of naturopaths were trained for practice. However, the advent of scientific medicine in the 20th century greatly decreased the demand for naturopathic treatment. In the 1970s, when a \"natural\" counterculture movement espousing health foods and natural remedies began, many consumers sought out alternative treatments and CAM modalities enjoyed a surge in popularity. 8 Scope of Practice Data Series: Naturopaths III.

During this time, the number of complemen-tary and alternative practitioners, including naturopaths, acupuncturists, homeopaths, energy healers, herbalists and bodywork technicians, grew and licensure efforts for these non-traditional practitioners expanded. As discussed earlier, a naturopath (or naturopathic \"physician\") has graduated from a four-year graduate school of naturopathy with a doctor of naturopathy (ND) or doctor of medical naturopathy (NMD) degree, and is educated in both the basic sciences and comple-mentary and alternative treatment modalities. In some of the 14 states where naturopaths maintain licensure, statutory language may allow them to be called natur - opathic physicians. Notably, doctoral-level graduate naturopathic education is not the norm in the rest of the world. In England and Germany, for example, four-year degrees are adequate to train naturopathic practitioners. 16 Nor are there two competing factions of naturopathic practitioners in most of the world. The norm is to practice traditional natur - opathy. Moreover, in no other country are naturopathic practitioners referred to as naturopathic physicians. The AANP , the organization that represents \"natur - opathic physicians,\" declares their members to be (emphasis added) \"... educated in all of the same basic sciences as an M.D. but also [studied in] holistic and nontoxic approaches to therapy with a strong emphasis on disease prevention and optimizing wellness. In addi-tion to a standard medical curriculum, the naturopathic physician is required to complete four years of training in clinical nutrition, acupuncture, homeopathic medi-cine, botanical medicine, psychology, and counseling (to encourage people to make lifestyle changes in sup-port of their personal health). A naturopathic physician takes rigorous professional board exams so that he or she may be licensed by a state or jurisdiction as a primary care general practice physician.\" 17 A traditional naturopath is a practitioner who has obtained his or her education through some combina-tion of a mentorship program with another practitioner or an alternative clinic, or a distance learning program, and/or classroom schooling on natural health or other - wise holistic studies. These practitioners do not have naturopathy degrees from schools recognized as accred-ited by the U.S. Department of Education, but they may earn degrees from other schools or obtain certification from professional naturopathic organizations. 18 Tradi- tional naturopaths' education and training is neither standardized nor accredited, and therefore their skill set and training varies widely. 19 No state currently permits the licensure of traditional naturopaths, therefore no minimum requirements for practice are mandated. 20 The philosophical divide that separates traditional naturopaths from naturopathic \"physicians\" could not be wider. T raditional naturopaths, collectively represented by the American Naturopathic Medical Association (ANMA), actively oppose the licensure of naturopathy in any form, preferring to practice natural health care unlicensed. 21 Traditional naturopaths believe that licen- sure takes away their right to practice natural health care. 22 In fact, testimony from the ANMA or individual traditional naturopaths opposing the licensure of natur - opaths can often be found in the legislative dockets of many states. Accordingly, the ANMA offers this sample letter for their members to write their elected representatives on the licensing issue 23: 9 Scope of Practice Data Series: Naturopaths III.

My practice involves education of my clients, using natural therapies, including but not limited to fresh air, clean water, good diet, and exercise to attain a healthier body. I do not diagnose or treat disease and I represent the majority of practicing naturopaths. Naturopaths, Naturopathic Doctors, or Naturopathic Physicians have no business diag-nosing, dispensing drugs, or performing surgeries as set out in the legislation in question. Naturopaths, Naturopathic Doctors, or Naturopathic Physicians simply don't have the experience or education required. When diagnosing, dispensing drugs, or performing surgeries is needed, clients should see those licensed and trained to do so. You owe it to the public to protect them from the group seeking this scope of practice for naturopaths. You should require those people to attend traditional medical school. I took an oath to \"First do no harm\" and I intend to do just that. Please do not take my right to practice away because of a few untrained who want to be \"doctors\" and have the right to practice as equals to DO's and MD's. Thank you for considering a \"NO\" vote on (Bill #). In a recent proposal by naturopaths for expansion of scope of practice in Washington state, the ANMA notes: \"The naturopaths are asking for drugs, surgery and IV therapy which would cover chelation. These naturopaths are not just asking for any drug, they want narcotics under the Controlled Substances III & IV categories. It is obvious that these naturopaths want to be MDs without earning the education and doing an internship in hospitals. We urge you [ANMA members] to read this carefully, understand it, then write, call or e-mail a Washington State legislator whose name, address and phone number will appear on this page. We do not oppose properly trained doctors doing these practices. However, a naturopath pretending to have the knowledge to practice in this manner is definitely a 'danger to the public.'\" 24Primer on complementary and alternative medicine Greatly concerned with growing consumer use of CAM, in 1998 Congress established a new bureau of the National Institutes of Health, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM). Not a formal recognition of CAM, but rather a federal agency funded to apply rigorous scien-tific inquiry to the outcomes and safety of various CAM modalities, the stated mission of the NCCAM is to: Explore complementary and alternative healing practices in the context of rigorous science Train complementary and alternative medicine researchers Disseminate authoritative information to the public and professionals25 The NCCAM defines CAM as \"a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of conven-tional medicine. Conventional medicine is medicine as practiced by holders of M.D. (medical doctor) or D.O. (doctor of osteopathy) degrees and by their allied health professionals, such as physical therapists, psychologists, and registered nurses.\" The National Cancer Institute defines CAM as \"forms of treatment that are used in addition to (complementary) or instead of (alterna-tive) standard treatments. These practices generally are not considered standard medical approaches. Stan-dard treatments go through a long and careful research process to prove they are safe and effective, but less is known about most types of CAM. CAM may include dietary supplements, megadose vitamins, herbal prepa-rations, special teas, acupuncture, massage therapy, magnet therapy, spiritual healing, and meditation.\" However, the common popular characterization of CAM is any treatment that does not involve pharma-ceuticals or surgery. To that end, many conventional treatments are considered CAM by certain CAM practitioners and advocates. For example, nutritional counseling, vitamins, physical activity, the application of ice packs or heat compresses\u2014all conventional treat-ments\u2014have been adopted as CAM, and are typically counted in surveys and/or polls to indicate the surge of CAM in America.

Below is a brief primer on the modal- ities in each NCCAM grouping,26 many of which are commonly used by naturopaths. Whole medical systems Whole medical systems are built upon complete sys- tems of theory and practice. Often, these systems have evolved earlier than and apart from the conventional medical approach used in the United States. Homeopathy\u2014a whole medical system that origi - nated in Europe. Homeopathy seeks to stimulate the body's ability to heal itself by giving very small doses of highly diluted substances that in larger doses would produce illness or symptoms (an approach called \"like cures like\"). Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)\u2014a whole med - ical system that originated in China. TCM is based on the concept that disease results from disruption in the flow of qi and imbalance in the forces of yin and yang. Practices such as herbal therapy, meditation, massage and acupuncture seek to aid healing by restoring the yin-yang balance and the flow of qi. Ayurveda\u2014a whole medical system that originated in India. Ayurveda aims to integrate the body, mind and spirit to prevent and treat disease. Therapies used include herbs, massage and yoga. Naturopathy\u2014a whole medical system that originated in Europe. Naturopathy aims to support the body's ability to heal itself through the use of dietary and lifestyle changes together with CAM therapies such as herbs, massage and joint manipulation. Mind-body medicine Mind-body medicine uses a variety of techniques designed to enhance the mind's capacity to affect bodily function and symptoms. Some techniques that were considered CAM in the past have become mainstream, for example patient support groups and cognitive-behav-ioral therapy. Meditation\u2014a conscious mental process using certain techniques, such as focusing attention or maintaining a specific posture, to suspend the stream of thoughts and relax the body and mind. Other\u2014prayer, mental healing and therapies that use creative outlets such as art, music or dance. Biologically based practices Biologically based practices in CAM use substances found in nature, such as herbs, foods and vitamins. Some examples include dietary supplements, herbal products and the use of other so-called natural, but as yet scientifically unproven therapies (for example, using shark cartilage to treat cancer). The CAM domain of biologically based practices includes, but is not limited to, botanicals, animal-derived extracts, vitamins, min-erals, fatty acids, amino acids, proteins, prebiotics and probiotics (which are live bacteria and sometimes yeasts found in foods such as yogurt or in dietary supplements), whole diets and functional foods. Manipulative and body-based practices Manipulative and body-based practices in CAM are based on manipulation, the application of controlled force to a joint, moving it beyond the normal range of motion in an effort to aid in restoring health. Manipu-lation may be performed as a part of other therapies or whole medical systems. Under the umbrella of manipu-lative and body-based practices is a heterogeneous group of CAM interventions and therapies including Tui Na, rolfing, Bowen technique, Trager bodywork, Alexander technique, Feldenkrais method and a host of others. Chiropractic\u2014a form of spinal manipulation whereby subluxations, or misalignments of the spine, inter - rupt or interfere with \"nerve flow.\" The manipulation serves to \"adjust\" the vertebrae with the goal of cor - recting subluxations. 27 Massage\u2014pressing, rubbing and moving muscles and other soft tissues of the body, primarily by using the hands and fingers. The aim is to increase the flow of blood and oxygen to the massaged area. 26. Web.

Naturopathy as a profession Reflexology\u2014a practice in which pressure is applied to points on the foot and sometimes the hand with the intent to promote relaxation or healing in other parts of the body. Energy medicine Energy therapies involve the use of energy fields. They are of two types. 1. Biofield therapies are intended to affect energy fields that purportedly surround and penetrate the human body. The existence of such fields has not yet been scientifically proven. Some forms of energy therapy manipulate biofields by applying pressure and/or manip-ulating the body by placing the hands in or through these fields. Biofields have defied measurement to date by reproducible methods. Therapies involving these putative energy fields are based on the concept that human beings are infused with a subtle form of energy. This vital energy or life force is known by different names in different cultures, such as qi (pronounced \"chi\"). In traditional Chinese medicine, the vital energy or life force is supposed to regulate a person's spiritual, emotional, mental and physical health, and to be influenced by the oppos-ing forces of yin and yang. Vital energy is believed to flow throughout the human body, but it has not been measured by means of conventional instrumentation. Nonetheless, therapists claim that they can work with this subtle energy, see it with their own eyes, and use it to effect changes in the physical body and influence health. Examples of biofield therapy include: Qi gong\u2014a component of traditional Chinese medicine that combines movement, meditation and controlled breathing. The intent is to improve blood flow and the flow of qi. Reiki\u2014a therapy in which practitioners seek to transmit a universal energy to a person, either from a distance or by placing their hands on or near that per - son. The intent is to heal the spirit and thus the body. Therapeutic touch\u2014a therapy in which practitioners pass their hands over another person's body with the intent to use their own perceived healing energy to identify energy imbalances and promote health. 2. Bioelectromagnetic-based therapies involve the unconventional use of electromagnetic fields, such as pulsed fields, magnetic fields, or alternating-current or direct-current fields. The veritable energies employ mechanical vibrations (such as sound) and electro-magnetic forces, including visible light, magnetism, monochromatic radiation (such as laser beams) and rays from other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. They involve the use of specific, measurable wavelengths and frequencies to treat patients. Assessing the evidentiary basis for naturopathy Naturopaths claim that their natural treatments have been in use for hundreds of years. In many cases, neither the mechanism of action nor the efficacy of the natur - opathic treatment as prescribed have been documented or established. The lack of randomized controlled trials and other forms of rigorous scientific inquiry into natur - opathic treatments has not gone unnoticed by the medical and scientific communities. 28,29 Reinforcing the self-image of naturopathy as a distinct type of health care, according to one article, the AANP states that \"naturopathic medicine has its own unique body of knowledge, evolved and refined for centuries\" and is \"effective in treating all health problems, whether acute or chronic.\" 30 This collective professional isola- tionist identity of naturopaths lays the groundwork for substandard patient care. Not only does naturopaths' insistence on practicing on the fringe of modern medicine produce providers of questionable medical competence through an educational system fraught with scientific inaccuracies and omissions of even the most basic established medical principles, it also propagates the unfortunate result of patient care that is devoid of cur - rent, evidence-based medically accepted concepts. 28.

Naturopathy as a professionA lack of scientific proof for many of their treatment modalities does not deter naturopaths, however. One article in the April 2006 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine proposes that naturopaths disdain the application of evidence-based medicine (EBM) to their practice: This paper presents the voices of tradition-sensitive naturopathic practitioners in response to what they perceive as an ideologic assault by EBM advocates on the validity and integrity of natural medicine practice. Those natural medicine practices, which have tradition-based paradigms articulating vitalistic and holistic principles, may have significant prob-lems in relating to the idea of EBM as developed in biomedical contexts. The paper questions the appropriateness of imposing a methodology that appears to minimize or bypass the philosophic and methodological foundations of natural medicine, and that itself seems primarily driven by political considerations. 31 Is this \"unique body of knowledge\" not then subject to the same scientific, peer-reviewed scrutiny as are medi-cal concepts? At least one mainstream medical journal article has acknowledged the inherent difficulty in using traditional, randomized, controlled clinical trials for CAM modalities. At the same time, it called for medi-cine to demand CAM \"develop and defend a rational and coherent method for assessing causality and efficacy, though not necessarily one based on the results of con-trolled clinical trials.\" 32 To date, proponents of CAM and/or naturopathy have not proposed any alternative epistemology calculated to assess the efficacy of CAM treatments. Nonetheless, naturopaths and other CAM providers have begun conducting limited research and contribut-ing their results to the scientific body of literature. In many instances, such as the NCCAM-funded clini-cal trials discussed below, the efficacy of naturopathic treatments is not supported by clinical evidence. The NCCAM \"Research Results\" Web page lists the follow-ing examples 33: \"Pilot Study Provides New Insight on Effect of Ginkgo Extract on Dementia in the Elderly.\" Overall, in this study of the elderly, researchers did not find a reduction in progression to dementia in those using ginkgo versus those using placebo. (February 2008) \"Drinking Black Tea Shows No Impact on Cardio - vascular Risk Factors.\" It is commonly believed that polyphenol antioxidants, found in tea, have a variety of health benefits, including cardiovascular benefits. However, randomized trials to date have yielded mixed results on the effects of tea on cardiovascular risk factors. (October 2007) Some naturopathic treatments have been subjected to the gold standard research design: the randomized con-trolled trial. However, many of the studies considered by the profession to be \"naturopathic\" in nature involve treatments that are not unique to naturopathy. For exam-ple, Bastyr University, Seattle, considered by many to be the top naturopathic school in the United States, lists current and past research projects on its Web site. T wo of its current research projects include the nutritional stud-ies, \"Will a naturopathic diet improve glycemic manage-ment?\" and \"Effectiveness of two levels of pulse [beans/legumes] consumption on caloric restriction adherence and chronic disease risk.\" 34 Dietary modifications are hardly the sole province of naturopaths. However, results from these studies will add to the general scientific body of knowledge and should be encouraged. Bastyr also posts that 40 research projects have been completed or are underway. 35 A cursory review of its \"Current Research Studies\" Web page reveals 11 current research projects. 36 Four are non-clinical research proj- ects, seven are clinical research projects. Of these, one is an animal research project and six are human research projects, only one of which is identified as a randomized controlled trial. 37 Furthermore, of the 11 research proj- ects listed, only two investigators listed are also named as faculty on Bastyr's Web site. In just one study is the primary investigator also a faculty member. 38 31. Jagtenberg T et al. J Altern Complement Med. Evidence based medicine and naturopathy. 2006 Apr;12(3):323-8.

Congress appro-priated $121.4 million to the NCCAM for the fiscal year 2007. 39 However, 2007 press releases on the results of NCCAM-funded botanical/herbal clinical trials note a lack of efficacy for many CAM modalities studied (naturopaths commonly employ herbal/botanical and nutritional counseling in their treatments): Shark cartilage supplement does not extend the lives of lung cancer patients 40 Researchers announced the results of an NCCAM and National Cancer Institute co-funded clinical trial showing that a shark cartilage supplement did not improve the overall survival of patients with lung cancer. Colleagues at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center conducted this phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-con-trolled clinical trial at cancer centers throughout the U.S. and Canada. All 379 patients in the study received radiation and chemotherapy in addition to a shark cartilage supplement or a placebo pill. The study team found that those who took the supple-ment did not live any longer than those who took the placebo. A previous NCCAM-funded study also found shark cartilage did not benefit patients with advanced breast or colon cancer. Echinacea for the prevention and treatment of colds in adults 41 The research team tested three preparations of the roots of a species of echinacea called Echinacea angustifolia, which prior smaller studies had found to benefit adults with the common cold. The three preparations were made by extracting the root of E. angustifolia using procedures that represent some of the different ways that echinacea is available and used to treat the common cold. In this study, researchers found that none of the three prepara-tions of E. angustifolia at the 900 mg daily dose had significant effects on whether volunteers became infected with the cold virus or on the severity or duration of symptoms among those who developed colds. However, critics of this study believe the dose of E. angustifolia used was too low. St. John's wort and depression 42 An extract of the herb St. John's wort was no more effective for treating major depression of moderate severity than placebo, according to research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The randomized, double-blind trial compared the use of a standardized extract of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) to a placebo for treating major depression of moderate severity. The multisite trial, involving 340 participants, also compared the FDA-approved antidepressant drug sertraline (Zoloft \u00ae) to placebo as a way to measure how sensitive the trial was to detecting antidepressant effects. Questions remain as to whether naturopaths are inte-grating such clinical evidence into their treatment pro-tocols and, moreover, to what extent they are attempt-ing to elucidate\u2014for the benefit of their patients, as well as the scientific community\u2014the mechanisms of their traditional treatments such as homeopathy, traditional Chinese medicine, and botanical or herbal preparations. In a 2006 editorial in the Journal of Alter - native and Complementary Medicine, researchers from the National College of Naturopathic Medicine, Portland, Ore., and the Oregon College of Oriental Medicine, also in Portland, note that aside from the difficulty in applying the randomized controlled trial design to CAM treatments, \"an equally important impediment is the paucity of our understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying most CAM therapies. Stated most directly, in the absence of knowing how a treatment 'works,' an appropriate sham control cannot be designed rationally. And, without an appropriate sham control, the efficacy of a treatment cannot be assessed adequately. It has even been suggested that sham controls are more appro-priate for studying why CAM treatments are effective than whether they are effective.\" 43 This module does not purport to be an exhaustive lit-erature search on the natural remedies most commonly 39.

Naturopathy as a professionused by naturopaths, and should not be held as evidence of the efficacy or lack thereof of the particular natur - opathic CAM modalities discussed. However, it should be noted that, without consideration of research design or methodology, through the most basic of PubMed literature searches on the efficacy of CAM modalities, several sources (NCCAM press releases and studies in peer-reviewed medical journals) demonstrated positive outcomes for directed uses of acupuncture. As discussed elsewhere in this module, naturopathic graduate educa-tion does not typically prepare naturopaths to practice acupuncture. Most states that license naturopaths require additional training beyond the ND or NMD degree for naturopaths to use acupuncture in practice. Official state reports on naturopathy Many states have commissioned investigative reports or special committees to study the issues related to licensure or, in states where naturopaths currently enjoy licen-sure, issues related to the expansion of scope-of-practice privileges. Most of these state legislative or agency reports exhibit significant research into the history of the naturopathic profession, both nationally and within the state, as well as other states' experiences with naturopath licensure and/or professional regulation. These reports are excellent resources for those states anticipating licensure or scope of practice expansion proposals by naturopaths. Arizona (2000) In 2000 the Arizona Office of the Auditor General conducted an audit and sunset review 44 of the Arizona Naturopathic Physicians Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to a June 16, 1999, resolution of the Joint Leg-islative Audit Committee. This audit noted significant concerns with the operative processes of the Arizona board, potentially attributable to lack of oversight. (Note: The Arizona Naturopathic Physicians Board of Medical Examiners was established in 1935 to regulate naturopathic physicians through licensure. Naturopaths were once restricted to using natural, drugless and nonsurgical methods, however, in 1992 the law was changed to allow naturopaths to perform many of the same activities performed by allopathic and osteopathic physicians.)The audit report also concluded that the Arizona board needed to improve complaint processing to ensure that complaints were resolved in a timely and appropriate manner. At the time of the review, it had developed a backlog of cases. Of 13 unresolved complaints, five had been open for more than 1,000 days. 45 The audit report also noted that Arizona naturopaths enjoyed the most liberal scope of practice and prescrib-ing formulary in the nation, and suggested the Legis-lature review the board's statutes in order to ascertain whether \"the Legislature intended such an extension of naturopaths' activities.\" With regard to the Arizona board's proposal to recognize 16 specialties within natur - opathic medicine, including family medicine and minor surgery, internal medicine, neurology and psychiatry, and ophthalmology, the report authors concluded, \"No other state that regulates naturopaths recognizes such a broad range of specialties.\" 46 The audit report authors also suggested the Legislature review the Arizona Naturopathic Physicians Board of Medical Examiners statutes to determine if increased oversight should be provided on what prescriptions naturopaths can write. \"The Board's statutes require it to develop a list of 'natural substances' that naturopaths can prescribe, but the statutes do not define what 'natural substances' are. The Board has developed an extensive list, or formulary, that includes not only vitamins and minerals, but also vaccines, antibiotics, oral contracep-tives, anabolic steroids, and controlled substances such as morphine and cocaine. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has recently approved Arizona natur - opaths to prescribe controlled substances from the for - mulary because this appears to be in accordance with state law. Although some other states allow naturopaths to prescribe and dispense drugs, none has a list as exten-sive as what the Board has developed. Most of these states also have separate oversight bodies to develop or review the list, while Arizona does not.\" 47 Most importantly, however, the Arizona Auditor Gen-eral's Office found a disturbing lack of valid competency assessment of candidates for naturopathic licensure in the state (emphasis added): 44.

Naturopathy as a professionThe Board needs to correct numerous problems with its three-part licensing examination, or adopt a national examination, to ensure that the natur - opaths it licenses are competent. Since 1997, the Board has been administering a licensing examina-tion it developed specifically for Arizona. Problems with this examination call into question its validity as a tool for measuring an applicant's competence to practice naturopathy. For example, the Board has not ensured that the examination tests what a naturopath would need to know to practice safely and has not shown that examination writers possess the neces-sary expertise and training to develop test questions. Further, the Board has made extensive adjustments to examination scores. For example, one licensure appli-cant received credit for 90 questions that she had answered incorrectly on one part of the February 1999 exam. As a result of such scoring adjustments, no one has failed the Board's exam since September 1998. The shortcomings noted in the Auditor General's report indicate a serious and disconcerting lack of regard for public safety. The failure of the naturopathic profession in the state of Arizona to address professional com-plaints in a timely manner, to ensure the administration of licensing examinations of sufficient quality so as to protect the public from dangerous practitioners, and to maintain their professional scope of practice within the areas for which naturopaths are educated and trained, should instill a lack of public confidence in the natur - opathic profession in Arizona. Colorado (2005) The state of Colorado performed a sunrise review of naturopaths in 2005. 48 The Colorado report found that naturopaths in the state presented evidence supporting their proposal request for state licensure and regulation. This report contains a valuable compilation of other states' licensure and scope of practice regulations for naturopaths as of 2005. For instance, the Colorado report illustrates the lack of recognized safeguards prevalent in the licensed practice of naturopathy in the United States: Four out of 15 states do not require licensed natur - opaths to partake in any continuing medical educa-tion whatsoever. Only three out of 15 states mandate that licensed naturopaths carry professional liability insurance. Additionally, the Colorado report provides an excel- lent psychometric analysis of the Naturopath Physicians Licensing Examination (NPLEX). The Colorado Office of Examination Services performed an analysis of the NPLEX test construction and scoring methods, and made several key observations: 49 To date, there is little generalizable evidence that NPLEX Part II clinical licensing examinations actu-ally measure clinical competence. The thirteen years of NPLEX examination statistics presented ... indicate that the band within which we can be reasonably sure an examinee's true score lies can be variable and somewhat concerning if we are drawing conclusions about technical knowledge of a candidate based on his/her particular test score. Unlike the NPLEX, the United States Medical Licensing Examination and the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination are three-part licensing examinations, each containing a separate Step/Level 3 that specifically assesses whether the examinee can apply medical knowledge and understanding of biomed-ical and clinical science essential for the unsupervised practice of medicine, with emphasis on patient man-agement in ambulatory settings. Step/Level 3 provides a final assessment of physicians assuming independent responsibility for delivering general medical care. 50 Florida (2004) The \"2004 Sunrise Report on Proposed Licensure of Naturopathic Physicians\" concluded that there is \"potential risk from licensing naturopathic physicians to allow them to provide a broad range of primary care services.\" The state of Florida abolished its licensing provisions for naturopathy in 1959, grandfathering in several practicing naturopaths who had been licensed at that time. The 2004 report was conducted as proponents for naturopathy again sought licensure in the state. 48. Web.

Naturopathy as a professionThe authors of the report concluded that: The proponents of regulation did not provide evi - dence that there is substantial harm or that the public is endangered from the unregulated practice of the profession. The department and other sources indicate there is a risk of harm to the public from licensing naturopathic physicians with an expanded scope of practice. 51 Massachusetts (2002) A legislative commission to study naturopathy and the prospect of licensure was established at the request of naturopaths in Massachusetts. In 2002 the Majority and Minority of the Massachusetts Special Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medical Practitioners presented their reports. 52 Although the majority report recommended licensure for naturopaths be granted, the minority of the special commission was compelled to submit its own report, highlighting significant deficiencies in the majority's fact-finding process and in the information presented within the majority report. The minority report provides extensive examples of the unscientific basis for natur - opathic treatment and calls into question the failure of the majority to report on the validity of treatments used by naturopaths in the care of patients. \"Those [members of the commission] favoring licensure of naturopaths did not show an interest in investigating the validity of naturopathic practices. We ask the legislature to ques-tion why the proponents of naturopathy did not discuss the validity of specific naturopathic practices.\" In addition, the minority report contains detailed sig- nificant findings related to the education and practice of naturopaths. 53 \"Evidence shows that the course content of naturopathy schools is filled with unscientific asser - tions that strain credulity. ... Evidence was presented showing that both graduates and practicing naturopaths lack experience in recognition of disease and effects of treatment.\" 51. Web.

Homeopathy and naturopathy: practice characteristics and pediatric care. Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 2000 Jan;154(1):75-80.The authors of the minority report assert a logical approach in opposing licensure to naturopaths. \"Standard naturopathic practice is substandard medical practice. Thus, an independent naturopathic board would legiti-mize unacceptable practices. ... [T]hus, the establish-ment of a self-regulating naturopathic board would, paradoxically, endorse practices that would be grounds for discipline if performed by a physician.\" Though professional collaboration should be the norm among health professionals, the authors of the minor - ity report state that serious problems would arise with regard to professional collaboration should naturopaths be granted licensure in Massachusetts. First, they argue, naturopaths by their very training are disinclined to refer patients for conventional medical care. Natur - opaths consider naturopathy to be a \"distinct system of complementary health care,\" not complementary to conventional medical care. In fact, the authors note that every naturopathic treatise or professional litera-ture denigrates modern medicine as \"treating only the symptoms, not the cause\" of disease, and warns the reader about pharmaceuticals, which are consistently referred to as \"toxins.\" 54 Therefore, it is highly unlikely, the authors conclude, that a naturopath would refer a patient to a physician for medical care. These statements are corroborated by a 1999 study pub- lished in the Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine. Using professional naturopathic associations to iden-tify possible subjects, the author surveyed practicing naturopaths and homeopaths in Massachusetts. Results showed that nearly all respondents reported treating children, but fewer than half of the responding practitio-ners reported any formal pediatric training. Most prac-titioners reported that they did not actively recommend immunizations and fewer than half of the nonphysician practitioners reported that they would refer a two- week-old neonate with a fever to a medical doctor or emergency medical facility. The author concluded that many of the patients using homeopathy and naturopa-thy are children. \"Failure on the part of these providers to recommend immunizations or recognize potentially serious illnesses is cause for concern.\" 5518 Scope of Practice Data Series: Naturopaths III. Naturopathy as a professionThe Massachusetts minority report also notes that the medical code of ethics precludes physicians from col-laborating with unscientific practitioners, such as natur - opaths. In particular, AMA Ethical Opinion E-3.01 is referenced, which reads: It is unethical to engage in or to aid and abet in treatment which has no scientific basis and is dan-gerous, is calculated to deceive the patient, by giving false hope, or which may cause the patient delay in seeking proper care. The report of the majority, as mentioned above, does not include any information on the safety, efficacy or scientific validity of naturopathic treatments. Instead, it provides recommendations for an administrative framework to support the implementation of naturopath licensure, as well as training standards for licensure that mirror the requirements of the accrediting body for naturopathic schools. Although presented with text-books used in naturopathy schools, the majority \"was not able to determine the quality or reliability of these books or the standards used in developing them.\" 56 There is at least one statement in the majority report that is untrue. Under the section entitled \"Criteria that suggest the need for licensure,\" the majority truthfully states that the accreditor of naturopathy schools, the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME), is a private accrediting agency not recognized by the fed-eral government. The report then incorrectly states that the accrediting body for conventional medical schools is similarly not recognized by the federal government. 57 Nothing is further from the truth. The Liaison Com-mittee on Medical Education, the accreditor of U.S. medical schools, has been continuously recognized by the U.S. Department of Education since 1952. 58 Instead, it was the CNME that had its recognition from the U.S. Department of Education revoked in 2001 (just prior to the release of the majority and minority Massachusetts reports) for failure to apply its own standards to a natur -opathy school in candidate status for accreditation. At the time of the Massachusetts Commission's reports, the CNME was not recognized by the Department of Educa-tion, while the Liaison Committee on Medical Education previously had been and continues to be recognized by the Department of Education as the sole accreditor of U.S. medical schools awarding the MD degree. Likewise, the American Osteopathic Association's Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation is recognized by the Department of Education as the sole accreditor of U.S. osteopathic medical colleges awarding the DO degree, and has continuously maintained its recognition since 1952. 59 Missouri (2006) A 2006 Report of the Senate Interim Committee on Naturopathic Medicine in Missouri60 noted significant concerns with the education and standardized testing of naturopaths: Questions have been raised as to the extent to which the NPLEX (the Naturopathic Licensing Examina-tion) effectively measures competency. ... Unlike the NPLEX, the USMLE (U.S. Medical Licensing Exam) has a third part (USMLE Part III) designed to test clinical competence and \"assess whether medical graduates can apply medical knowledge and under - standing of biomedical and clinical science essential for the unsupervised practice of medicine.\" The Committee views the absence of such an evaluation as a significant flaw in the NPLEX. The main accrediting organization for naturopathic colleges has been in and out of favor with the U.S. Department of Education. ... As a result, the Com-mittee does not have full faith in the diligence of the CNME as an accrediting body.\" Finally, emphasizing the inadequacy of the evidence presented them by proponents for naturopathic licen-sure, and also echoing public confusion regarding the 56.

Naturopathy as a professionqualifications of naturopaths, the committee concluded, \"it remains unclear to the committee ... who is a natur - opath or what makes one a naturopath. This is a funda- mental and necessary question that the committee was unable to determine.\" 61 Nevada (An administrative history of the Board of Naturopathic Healing) The Nevada Board of Naturopathic Healing was created in 1981. Nevada statutes required that the board consist of the following members appointed by the Governor: three licensed naturopaths engaged in the practice of naturopathic healing for more than two years in the state, one licensed physician who is a valid Nevada resi-dent and one public member who is neither a licensed health practitioner nor a health administrator. The stat-ute allowed the initial naturopaths on the board to be licensed and engaged in practice in another state, and authorized their appointment to the board to constitute their licensure in Nevada. The first chairman of the Nevada Board of Naturopathic Healing submitted his resignation in 1982 and the three other members resigned in 1983, leaving the one non-health practitioner, who was unable to take any action for lack of a quorum. Until the governor appointed qualified members, the board remained inactive. Mean-while, the legislative subcommittee received testimony and correspondence alleging that certain licensed natur - opaths in the state were practicing with questionable, if not fraudulent credentials. The subcommittee recom-mended a modification of the board's membership, and that the skills and knowledge of all Nevada licensed naturopaths be thoroughly examined and verified. There appeared to be little board activity after 1983, and in 1987 the state assembly enacted a bill that rendered the board defunct. Any license issued by the Nevada Board of Naturopathic Healing expired on July 1, 1987. 62Demographics of the profession Number of licensed naturopaths in the U.S. work force In 2004 it was estimated there were 1,500 naturopaths practicing in the United States.63 As of late 2005, the AANP reported approximately 4,000 naturopathic doc-tors were practicing in the United States, but a 2006 tally of naturopaths in the 15 states that permit licensure of naturopaths revealed approximately 3,300 licensed naturopaths. There is no practical estimate of the num-ber of naturopaths practicing in states where licensure is not permitted, nor is there an estimate of the number of traditional naturopaths currently practicing in any or all states. (See Figure 1, page 46, for more information.) Employment types/locales Most naturopaths establish private naturopathic practices or teach at schools of naturopathy. Naturopathic practi-tioners may work with physicians or chiropractors, or in hospitals, nursing homes, clinics, health clubs or resorts. 64 Salary data A Seattle newspaper stated in December 2003 that most naturopaths established private practices and earned $35,000 to $100,000 annually. 65 A 2004 survey conducted by the National College of Naturopathic Medicine found that the median take-home pay for individuals working 32 hours or more per week was $45,000, while the average was $54,000. The high annual take-home pay was $250,000. 66 The Princeton Review online, in its graduate school and careers section, notes that \"according to a survey by the AANP , naturopathic doctors generally earn in the low to mid range of family practice doctors. A beginning ND, just starting up his or her practice, working part time or building a staff, may earn between $20,000 to $30,000 per year. However, an ND who runs or partners in a large, busy practice makes an average estimated income of $80,000 to $90,000 per year\u2014and may make upwards of $200,000.\" 67 61. Id. 62. Web.

Billing for servicesMedicare Medicare does not provide for the reimbursement of naturopathy.68 In 1968 the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (now the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services) reported to Congress, recommending that naturopathic services not be added to Medicare coverage. 69 Naturopaths had requested coverage for the services of naturopathic physicians under Part B of the Supplementary Medical Insurance Program as independent practitioners serving as \"points of entry,\" similar to doctors of medicine and osteopathy, but subject to restrictions in treatment as specified in state licensure laws. 70 The report contained an enormous amount of research, and Congress ultimately declined the naturopaths' request for coverage, concluding that \"naturopathic theory and practice are not based on the body of basic knowledge related to health, disease, and health care which has been widely accepted by the scientific com-munity. Moreover, irrespective of its theory, the scope and quality of naturopathic education do not prepare the practitioner to make an adequate diagnosis and pro-vide appropriate treatment.\" 71Medicaid Medicaid will cover acupuncture and/or naturopathic services if the practitioner is licensed in the state where the service is provided and the service is considered a medical necessity. 72 The Medicaid Act does not define \"medically necessary\"; each state is allowed to develop its own definition for operation of the Medicaid pro-gram in the state. 73 Private payers More than 90 insurance carriers currently cover natur - opathic medicine in the United States and Canada.74 Increasingly, NDs are covered as specialists and primary care providers under corporate reimbursement plans. 75 Connecticut, Washington, Montana and Alaska have mandated insurance reimbursement for \"medically nec-essary and appropriate naturopathic medical services.\" 76 Non-physician Monograph series: licensure of natur - opathic physicians (Jan. 2004). www.naturowatch.org/licensure/flasunrise2004.html.

Education and training of naturopaths Doctoral programs/degrees As mentioned earlier, naturopathy has been in existence in the United States for more than 100 years, but modern graduate naturopathic education is relatively new. The oldest of the accredited U.S. schools of naturopathy was established in 1956, with the remaining three accredited schools first admitting students in the years 1978, 1992 and 1996, respectively. 77 The ND and NMD programs lead to a doctoral degree in naturopathy and typically require four years of graduate study. Some schools offer ND degrees as cor - respondence courses with little or no requirement for supervised clinical practice. Programs accredited by the CNME that offer an ND or NMD degree require clinical internship during the third and fourth years of study. 78 Accrediting bodies Founded in 1978, the CNME is presently accepted as the programmatic accrediting agency for naturopathic education by the four-year naturopathic colleges and programs in the United States and Canada, by the American and Canadian national naturopathic profes-sional associations, and by the North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners. The CNME received initial recognition from the U.S. Department of Education in 1987, lost recognition status in 2001 due to its failure to apply its own accreditation standards to a candidate school for accreditation, and ultimately regained recogni - tion status in 2003. (See next section for more information.) The American Naturopathic Medical Accreditation Board (ANMAB) also accredits U.S. schools of natur - opathy leading to the ND degree, as well as schools that offer certificates, diplomas or coursework in the natur - opathic arts and sciences. U.S. Department of Education recognition of accrediting bodies The U.S. Department of Education recognizes the CNME as the national programmatic accrediting agency for programs leading to the NMD or ND degree. 79 Accrediting agencies with the Department of Educa-tion's recognition have been found in compliance with the federal regulations that apply to educational accred-iting agencies, and are determined to be reliable author - ities as to the quality of education or training provided by the institutions of higher education and the higher education programs they accredit. 80 The Department of Education's recognition means the schools or specialized educational programs the accrediting agency accredits are eligible to seek participation in programs sponsored by federal agencies. Students and graduates of U.S. naturopathic medicine programs with CNME accredita-tion are eligible to apply for such federal programs as the Academic Research Enhancement Awards and the Loan Repayment Program, and receive federal student aid. 81 Originally recognized by the Department of Educa-tion as an accrediting agency in 1987, the CNME was stripped of its recognized status Jan. 16, 2001, as a result of its failure to apply its own standards to a candidate school for accreditation, the Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine and Health Sciences. 82 Before 1987, U.S. schools of naturopathy were not accredited by any body recognized by the U.S. Department of Edu-cation, thus providing no assurance as to the quality of the education received by naturopathic graduates prior to this time. 21 Scope of Practice Data Series: Naturopaths V.

One of these situ-ations included the \"inadequate financial support and control of the institution.\" 85 The U.S. Department of Education found that dur - ing the period of 1996-1999, while Southwest College was a candidate for accreditation, \"the entire financial structure [of the college] had become unstable.\" Because of financial constraints, the school had no president, senior vice president/chief operating officer or dean of students. Moreover, the college had \"a large accumu-lated debt,\" and the school's tuition could not cover its operating expenses, much less its debt. The November 1997 CNME evaluation team believed the school was operating \"under crisis management.\" 86 A prior 1996 CNME evaluation visit to Southwest College, as well as the November 1997 visit, produced merely recommendations and scheduled future visits by the CNME. Situations had not improved in April 1998 or in March 1999. Regulations of the Department of Education require that candidate status for accreditation can last no longer than five years. In 1999, as the col-lege's period for candidacy neared its end, its leadership announced a decision to close the school and classes were ultimately cancelled for two weeks.The Department of Education denied the CNME rec-ognition as an accreditor of naturopathic schools due to its failure to issue a show-cause letter to Southwest College, despite overwhelming evidence of the school's inadequate financial support and control. More suc-cinctly, the \"[c]onditions at [Southwest College] contin-ued to deteriorate significantly,\" yet the CNME did not act (deliver a show-cause letter) until officials attempted to close the school. According to the Department of Education's memorandum, the CNME did not \"take prompt adverse action\" or \"require [Southwest College] to bring itself into compliance\" with CNME standards for accreditation. The CNME was re-recognized by the U.S. Department of Education in 2003. 87 To regain its recognition, the CNME had to \"consistently apply and enforce stan-dards that ensure that the course or programs ... are of sufficient quality to achieve ... the stated objective for which the courses or the programs are offered\" in the future. The CNME is scheduled for a renewal of recog-nition review by the Department of Education again in the spring of 2008. 88 The ANMAB is not currently recognized by the U.S. Department of Education as a programmatic accreditor of post-secondary programs in naturopathy. However, four U.S. schools awarding ND degrees publicize their ANMAB accreditation on their Web sites. 89 U.S. and Canadian schools granting ND or NMD degrees Research has identified eight U.S. schools of natur - opathy that grant doctoral degrees and two additional schools in Canada. There are four CNME-accredited doctoral programs in the United States, one in Canada, and one school in Canada that is a candidate for accreditation. 90 As of August 2006, among the four U.S. 22 Scope of Practice Data Series: Naturopaths V.

The CNME has granted candidate status to The Boucher Institute of Naturopathic Medicine located in British Columbia. 95 All U.S. and Canadian accredited schools operate their degree programs on campus (as opposed to distance or online learning). The financial instability of the Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine has been previously mentioned. The UB similarly faced significant fiscal and administra-tive problems when, as a result of declining enrollment in the 1980s and reduced state and federal funding for higher education during this period, the school's admin-istration attempted to fire nearly 50 tenured faculty and demand a 30 percent decrease in salary from the rest of the faculty. What resulted was the longest strike of faculty in the history of U.S. higher education. 96 Interestingly, a group called the Professors World Peace Academy (PWPA) offered financial assistance to the UB with a program of forgivable loans in 1992. The PWPA is a satellite group of the Unification Church of Sun Myung Moon 97 (a group commonly known as the \"Moonies\"). The amount loaned to the UB over the years nears $110 million. According to one 1997 article on the Unification Church bailout of the UB: Instantly, there was a mass exodus of faculty from the university. Many professors did not want to be associated with a cult. The strikers settled with UB, but had to sign documents to the effect that they would never seek employment at the school again. The Law School, the university's only profitable program, dissolved its association and fled to Quin-nipiac College in Hamden. The PWPA was given the right to name 60% of the UB board.UB has become a center for alternative and unproven pseudo-medical propaganda. It was the first U.S. university to officially create a College of Chiropractic. In the fall of 1996, the new school of Naturopathy was opened ... .

Minimum standard requirements for NCCAOM certi-fication include graduation from an accredited program leading to a Master of Acupuncture certificate. This course must be at least three academic years in length and consist of at least 105 credits of specified coursework, with at least 1,905 contact hours, 660 of which must be spent in supervised clinical experiences. 111 Naturopathy students at Bastyr University receive a three-credit (33 hour) didactic course on \"the fundamental principles\" of traditional Chinese medicine and unknown hours of supervised clinical experience with acupuncture tech-nique. 112 Most schools of naturopathy do, however, offer optional extended study for their students to meet most state licensing requirements for acupuncture.

These clinical rotations may include specialization in organ system studies, physical medicine and naturopathic manipulative therapy. 117 It also appears that didactic education continues throughout the third and fourth years of study (i.e., these years are not wholly spent in clinical rotations), although with fewer lecture hours than in the first two years, further decreasing the time spent in clinical settings. All CNME-accredited naturopathic doctoral programs require candidates for graduation to participate in clini-cal rotations. 118 The clinical education program begins in the third year of naturopathic education and must be at least 1,200 clock hours, with at least 60 percent of the program's required hours in direct patient care. 119 Therefore, the minimum requirement for direct patient care in a CNME-accredited naturopathic doctoral pro-gram is only 720 hours over two years. The Textbook of Natural Medicine Popularly hailed as the foremost reference book in naturopathy, the Textbook of Natural Medicine was writ-ten by Joseph E. Pizzorno, ND, and Michael T. Murray, ND. Pizzorno is the founding president, now emeritus, of Bastyr University, and Murray is a former faculty member at Bastyr. Originally published in 1985, the textbook, now in its third edition, is widely studied in schools of naturopathy. In 2001 Arnold S. Relman, MD, professor emeritus, Medicine and Social Medicine, Harvard Medical School, and editor-in-chief emeritus of The New Eng-land Journal of Medicine, reviewed the second edition of the Textbook of Natural Medicine (1999) as part of a legislative inquiry into naturopathic medicine in Massachusetts. 120 Dr. Relman's thoughts appear below. [T]he licensing of naturopathic medical practitio-ners as independent providers of primary health care would endanger the health and safety of the public and would not result in health benefits com-mensurate with its risks. There is abundant evidence in the Textbook to support this conclusion, but I summarize below only a few of the most problematic examples of the deficiencies and dangers in natur - opathic practices 121: The Textbook describes the diagnosis and treatment of only 70 \"specific health problems,\" and they are simply listed in alphabetical order, without regard to the nature of the condition or the organ(s) involved. In comparison, standard textbooks of conventional medicine provide a much more rational and system-atic presentation that includes hundreds of disease conditions and describes them in much greater depth and detail. The Textbook includes in its 70 chapters on specific diseases nothing about cancer, diseases of the blood (including leukemias and anemias), noth-ing about heart attacks or serious abnormal rhythms 114. The Purdue University program in dietetics was ranked fourth in the nation out of 240 undergraduate dietetics/nutrition programs in 1998, as reported by the Gourman Report. 115. Web.

Education and training of naturopathsof the heart (such as atrial fibrillation), and virtually nothing about kidney diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cirrhosis of the liver, or about many common and serious infections such as pul-monary tuberculosis, malaria, syphilis, meningitis, encephalitis or bacterial endocarditis. Lacking ade-quate education about these diseases, naturopathic practitioners might fail to diagnose them in a timely fashion or delay in referring patients for appropriate medical treatment. 122 Dr. Relman cited several examples of common, serious diseases that are dangerously mistreated in the textbook 123: The chapter on the treatment of anginal (coronary artery) heart disease does not even mention the use of nitrates, beta-blockers or calcium-channel blockers\u2014all of which are standard, effective, FDA-approved treatment for this condition. Failure to use one or more of these agents in the treatment of severe angina would probably be considered medical malpractice. There is no mention of \"statin\" drugs to lower cholesterol and prevent further progression of coronary heart disease. The use of angioplasty or bypass surgery for patients unresponsive to pharma-cologic therapy is dismissed. The chapter on high blood pressure says nothing about the diagnostic workup that is often needed to rule out certain curable causes (such as certain diseases of the adrenal gland, or obstruction in the aorta or the renal arteries). It recommends diet lifestyle changes and the use of herbs, but admits that severe cases unresponsive to these \"natural\" measures may require treatment with pharmaceu-ticals (presumably under the management of a conventional medical doctor). However, it ends with the dangerous advice that once control of high blood pressure has been achieved with drugs, the naturopathic physician should have the patient \"taper off\" the medications. For some such patients, a reduction in medication risks sudden resurgence of severe hypertension and the possibility of a stroke or heart attack. Most patients with severe hyperten-sion need to remain on medication indefinitely, or for many years. The chapter on diabetes says very little about the use of insulin, nothing about oral hypoglycemic drugs, and nothing about the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of diabetic acidosis\u2014except to warn that it is a medical emergency that will require hos-pitalization. The chapter on HIV infection and AIDS advocates various types of herbal and \"natural\" remedies, but gives no information about conventional drug therapy. Although it is admitted that no clinical studies have yet demonstrated the effectiveness of naturopathic medical care in HIV infection when used alone, or even as a supplement to conventional medical treatment, the chapter nevertheless ends with this advice: 'We urge physicians to apply the principles of naturopathic medicine in the care of their HIV positive patients.' As if this neglect of the proven life-prolonging value of anti-viral pharma-cotherapy were not shocking enough, the chapter also fails to recommend drug treatment of pregnant women with HIV infections, which is standard practice for the prevention of HIV transmission to the newborn. Neglect of such treatment would surely be considered malpractice in the medical profession. As already noted, naturopathic teaching (as exem- plified in the Textbook) claims that \"natural\" herbal remedies are generally superior to pharmaceuticals in the treatment of most diseases\u2014despite the fact that the FDA forbids the manufacturers of herbal preparations and dietary supplements from mak-ing therapeutic claims. The Textbook nevertheless devotes a large section to herbs and dietary supple-ments in which many such claims are made, often with little or no credible supporting evidence in the peer-reviewed scientific literature. 124 Dr. Relman concludes his review by stating: Primary care practitioners whose education does not include the use of prescription drugs simply cannot be expected to provide effective and safe care for many serious conditions they are likely to encounter. While it is true that unnecessary or inappropriate use of drugs is harmful, and that even proper usage of drugs can sometimes cause serious reactions, there can be no doubt that on balance prescription drugs have been enormously benefi-cial, and that drugs will be even more important in 122.

The anti-pharmaceutical bias of natur - opathic education (as illustrated in the Textbook) therefore poses real risks for patients who rely on naturopaths for the management of their illnesses. Without prompt and appropriate drug therapy many patients with serious diseases will die. 125 Specific examples of other dangerous scientific inaccuracies in the second edition of the textbook include the fol-lowing naturopathic treatment claims (with correspond-ing scientific commentary refuting the treatment claim): St. John's wort for the treatment of HIV-positive patients In 2000 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) posted the following public health advisory* on its Web site: \"[R]esults from a study conducted by The National Institutes of Health (NIH) that showed a significant drug interaction between St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), an herbal prod-uct sold as a dietary supplement, and indinavir, a protease inhibitor used to treat HIV infection. In this study, concomitant administration of St. John's wort and indinavir substantially decreased indinavir plasma concentrations, potentially due to induc-tion of the cytochrome P450 metabolic pathway. ... [B]ased on these results, it is expected that St John's wort may significantly decrease blood con-centrations of all of the currently marketed HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) and possibly other drugs (to varying degrees) that are similarly metabolized, including the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Consequently, concomitant use of St John's wort with PIs or NNRTIs is not recommended because this may result in suboptimal antiretroviral drug concentrations, leading to loss of virologic response and development of resistance or class cross-resistance.\" 126 *This FDA public health advisory was released in February 2000. The second edition of the Textbook of Natural Medicine was published in Sep - tember 1999.127 Information on NIH-funded trials is public information.Electrochemical silver solutions exhibit antimicrobial effectiveness In 1999 the FDA stated it was \"issuing a final rule [21 CFR Part 310] establishing that all over-the-counter (OTC) drug products containing colloidal silver ingredients or silver salts are not generally recognized as safe and effective, and are misbranded. FDA is issuing this final rule because many OTC drug products containing colloidal silver ingredients or silver salts are being marketed for numerous seri-ous disease conditions and FDA is not aware of any substantial scientific evidence that supports the use of OTC colloidal silver ingredients or silver salts for these disease conditions.\" 128 Publisher Churchill Livingstone released a third edition of the Textbook of Natural Medicine in November 2005. Critiques or analyses of this current edition are either not known to exist or are unavailable. 129 Requirements for graduation An ND or NMD degree generally requires four years of graduate study. Several ND programs allow students to extend study by one or two years. All students are required to complete both the didactic and clinical portions of the education program. 130 Post-graduate training Post-graduate training is not required of graduates of naturopathic schools except in the state of Utah, which currently requires one year of post-graduate natur - opathic training. Each of the four CNME-accredited naturopathic schools offers a one-year post-doctoral training program. These \"residencies\" may include placement in naturopathic clinics or private practices, where naturopathic philosophy and treatment are applied to patients in primary care, pediatrics, emergency care, pharmacy compounding, geriatrics, nutritional counseling and obstetrics. 131 125.

Education and training of naturopathsIn 2005 the CNME implemented an approval process for naturopathic post-graduate training programs. How-ever, there are no standard requirements for naturopa-thy curriculum, rotations or experiences. In terms of program content, all that is required by the CNME is that the participant receive 35 hours a year of didactic instruction and participate in \"scholarly activities that promote a spirit of inquiry, scholarship and critical thinking, such as discussions, rounds, study clubs, pre-sentations, conferences, and local, regional or national professional associations and scientific societies.\" 132 As an example of the limited exposure to patients experienced by naturopathic post-graduates, below is a description of the training offered by the UB. 133 Note in particular the administrative nature of the majority of the duties assigned to the \"residents,\" the low number of hours spent in direct patient care and the absence of descriptions of patient pathology or patient populations expected to be seen by the residents. The [University of Bridgeport (UB)] residency pro-gram is part of the CNME approved residency pro-gram at National College of Naturopathic Medicine (NCNM). The UB residency offers a wide range of clinical experiences at three different settings. The resident will have an opportunity to supervise UB student clinicians at the UB Health Center and its satellite clinics. At the Integrative Medicine Center (IMC), which is affiliated with Yale Preventative Research Center (PRC) at Griffin Hospital, the resident will be working closely with conventional practitioners (MDs or a nurse practitioner) and a supervising Naturopathic physician to come up with appropriate diagnoses and treatment plans for patients. To increase patient exposures and to familiarize with conventional assessments and treat-ments, the resident will also have clinical rotations in different departments at Griffin Hospital and its affiliated clinics. UB Health Center: Supervise UB student clinicians at the UB Health Center and its satellite clinics for five 4-hour shifts or 20 hours per week. Perform administrative duties such as posting daily patient schedules and opening/closing the clinics. Keep track of patient contacts to report to the NCNM residency program. Integrative Medicine Center (IMC) at Griffin Hospital: Work at the IMC for three 4-hour shifts per week or 12 hours per week. Discuss diagnoses and treatment plans with con - ventional practitioners and a supervising ND and present to patients. Perform IVMT (Intravenous Micronutrients Therapy) or Myer's cocktail through IV push for fibromyalgia patients or Glutathione IV push for Parkinson's disease. Conduct dictations for new patients. Make follow-up phone calls to returning patients. Present Fire Chat talks on topics of your choice on a monthly basis to local community at the IMC. Keep track of patient contacts to report to the NCNM residency program. The resident may be required to help with the research at the PRC. Clinical Rotations at Griffin Hospital: Initiate and maintain clinical rotations in the departments of choice at Griffin hospital and its affiliated clinics for approximately two 5-hour shifts per week or 10 hours per week. Select an interesting case from the rotations and present a grand round to medical students and residents at Griffin hospital. Take a medical history, perform a physical exam, and present the case to attending physicians (MDs) before initiating diagnostic assessments and treatment plans. 132. Web.

This defi-ciency in the assurance of providing competent health care providers to the public is not at issue in examining physicians for licensure. As noted earlier, the USMLE and COMLEX-USA both contain a separate third com-ponent to specifically assess whether the examinee can apply medical knowledge and understanding of biomed-ical and clinical science essential for the unsupervised practice of medicine, with emphasis on patient manage-ment in ambulatory settings. Step 3 of the UMSLE and Level 3 of the COMLEX-USA provide a final assess-ment of physicians assuming independent responsibility for delivering general medical care. 141 Additionally, states may require candidates for naturo-pathic licensure pass a state-written and -administered examination for licensure. As mentioned previously, in 2000 the Arizona Office of the Auditor General reported a concerning lack of diligence by the Arizona Naturo- pathic Physicians Board of Medical Examiners in their examination of candidates for naturopathic licensure: The Board needs to correct numerous problems with its three-part licensing examination, or adopt a national examination, to ensure that the natur - opaths it licenses are competent. Since 1997, the Board has been administering a licensing examina-tion it developed specifically for Arizona. Problems with this examination call into question its validity as a tool for measuring an applicant's competence VI. Naturopath licensure and board certification Standardized national licensure examination The North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners (NABNE) developed and administers the Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Exam (NPLEX). 134 The exam consists of two parts, unlike the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) or the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination (COMLEX-USA), which each contain three steps/levels. NPLEX Part I, the \"basic science\" exam, is generally taken by students upon completion of their second year of naturopathy school. Eligibility requirements for Part I include enrollment in an accredited naturopathy school or an approved in-residence program, and completion of courses in the following subject areas to be tested: anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, microbiology and immunology, and pathology. 135 Each section contains 50 multiple choice questions and students are allotted 60 minutes to complete each section. 136 Individuals are eligible for NPLEX Part II, the \"core clinical science\" exam, upon graduation from an approved naturopathic medical education program and after fulfilling the NABNE basic science requirement by either passing NPLEX Part I or by having been granted a waiver by the NABNE. 137 NPLEX Part II consists of eight sections that test the core clinical sciences: physical and clinical diagnosis, lab diagnosis and diag-nostic imaging, emergency medicine and public health, pharmacology, botanical medicine, nutrition, physical medicine and counseling, behavioral medicine and health psychology. Each section contains 50 multiple choice questions and students are allotted 60 minutes per section. Additional time is given for the physical and clinical diagnosis (150 items, three hours) and lab diagnosis and diagnostic imaging (75 items, 90 minutes) sections. 138 Part II is offered over a course of three days. 31 Scope of Practice Data Series: Naturopaths VI.

For example, the Board has not ensured that the examination tests what a naturopath would need to know to practice safely and has not shown that examination writers possess the necessary expertise and training to develop test questions. Further, the Board has made extensive adjustments to examination scores. For example, one licensure applicant received credit for 90 ques-tions that she had answered incorrectly on one part of the February 1999 exam. As a result of such scor - ing adjustments, no one has failed the Board's exam since September 1998. 142 National board certification There is no generalist board certification available for the practice of naturopathy. However, a naturopath may achieve specialty certification by any of several organiza-tions. Several states require licensed naturopaths to obtain specialty certification in order to provide certain health care services. For example, it is most common for states to require naturopaths to achieve certification in natur - opathic childbirth or acupuncture if they want to provide those services. Naturopathic childbirth The American College of Naturopathic Obstetrics (ACNO) is the credentialing arm of the American Association of Naturopathic Midwives. Eligibility to sit for the three-hour ACNO examination requires that (1) the candidate is a student of a CNME-accredited naturopathic school or hold a degree from such a school; (2) the candidate has sat through 100 contact hours of didactic instruction on midwifery at a CNME-accredited school; and (3) the candidate has attended 15 births. A naturopathic midwife must hold a ND or NMD degree, but in essence receives the same certification as a certified professional midwife, more commonly known as a lay midwife. Many naturopathic colleges offer optional training programs that allow students or graduates to qualify for both the ACNO exam and the certified professional midwife exam offered by the North American Registry of Midwives.The American Association of Naturopathic Midwives describes naturopathic midwives as: [T]he most extensively trained natural childbirth providers available to you and your family. Natur - opathic midwives are trained to provide you with safe and effective midwifery care and their back-ground as licensed naturopathic doctors broadens the scope of care you will experience from preg-nancy and birth to full family natural health care. From preconception and infertility counseling through newborn and pediatric care, ongoing well woman and menopause concerns, naturopathic midwives are healthcare providers for all seasons of your family's health care needs. 143 Again, it is significant to note that naturopaths who attend births and deliver newborns are licensed only to the extent of a certified professional midwife (also known as a lay midwife). The doctoral degree does not confer upon the naturopath any birthing privileges greater than those of a lay midwife. Naturopathic acupuncture States that permit naturopaths to perform acupuncture typically require specialty certification. Candidates must submit documentation of didactic instruction and super - vised clinical experience. In addition, candidates must typically pass an examination, either the NPLEX Part II elective examination in acupuncture or a test offered by the National Certification Commission for Acupunc-ture and Oriental Medicine. In most cases, students of naturopathy who also want to practice acupuncture will need to extend their doctoral study by at least one year in order to fulfill state and/or examination requirements. 32 Scope of Practice Data Series: Naturopaths VI.

State licensure and regulation States that license naturopaths Naturopaths must meet licensing requirements in all states that recognize naturopathy through licensure. Presently, 14 states and the District of Columbia regu-late naturopaths through licensure: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, Oregon, Utah, Vermont and Washington. Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands similarly license naturopaths. The rest of the country does not recognize the profession through licensure, with South Carolina and Tennessee both expressly prohibiting the practice of naturopa-thy. 144 Wyoming states the following in its case law: Our statute is clear, that the practice of naturopathy cannot be regarded as a separate and distinct pro-fession like that of dentistry for instance, nor can any good reason be given why the legislature may not for the benefit of society require that those who practice the healing art should know and keep up with the improvements and advanced learning in that art. 145 Florida abolished its naturopath licensing laws in 1959, and in 2004 a legislative committee concluded that an expanded scope might be harmful, and that natur - opathic licensing is not cost-effective. 146 Several other states, including Texas and Virginia, have abolished previous naturopathy licensure provisions. 147 It is critical to note that in most states and provinces where naturopathic medicine is not regulated, individu-als may practice similar therapeutic approaches and/or call themselves naturopaths (whether or not they have been trained at a school for naturopathic medicine), because the terms \"naturopath\" and \"naturopathic medicine\" are not restricted terms. 148 Traditional natur - opathy is not a medical practice and, therefore, is not regulated through statutes or regulations in the states. One of the major initiatives of the AANP is to obtain licensure for naturopaths in all 50 states. 149 (See Figure 1 for more information on requirements for state licensure.) State scope of practice regulations for naturopaths Naturopaths' scope of practice varies by state. Natur - opaths seek privileges to prescribe drugs, not only those considered \"natural\" (hormones, purified botanicals, etc.), but also legend drugs, up to and including schedule III and IV controlled substances. Specific information on naturopath scope of practice can be found in Figure 2.

The AAFP recognizes the availability in the market place of complementary and alternative practice and its approaches to healthcare. The AAFP advocates the evaluation of these alternative treatments and complementary practice through various means including evidenced-based outcomes research as to their efficacy and effectiveness. To this end, the AAFP believes that physicians can best serve their patients by recognizing and acknowledging the availability of such alternatives and by educating themselves concerning these non-traditional methods of healing in order to facilitate appropriate education, treatment and counseling of patients and consumers. All clinical information regarding complementary or alternative practice presented or sponsored by the AAFP should include a discussion of the evidence on which it is based. (1997) (2003). American Osteopathic Association Non-Physician Clinicians Whereas, non-physician clinicians can be categorized into one of the three following groups: midlevel profes-sionals who are meant to work under the supervision of or in collaboration with physicians, non-physician inde-pendent traditional professionals who practice indepen-dently within specialty areas, and alternative medicine providers who follow and independently practice alter - native therapies; and Whereas, non-physician clinicians are gaining increased licensure and practice privileges in areas that were once only held by physicians including, but not limited to, prescribing drugs and medical or surgical treatments, practicing autonomously, performing surgery, and being reimbursed by all types of third-party payors; andWhereas , non-physician clinicians are gaining even more expansive privileges that they already possess; and Whereas, patient safety is the foremost concern when addressing issues of expanding scopes of practice for any healthcare profession; and Whereas, patient safety and state laws mandate that physicians meet a minimum threshold of education, post-graduate training, examination, and regulation for an unlimited license to practice medicine; and Whereas, many of these non-physician clinician profes- sions are undertaking tasks that overlap with physician practice without being required to meet the equivalent threshold of education, post-graduate training, examina-tion, and regulation established for physicians by state licensing boards; now, therefore, be it RESOLVED, that the American Osteopathic Associa- tion adopt the attached policy paper as its position on non-physician clinicians including appropriate onsite supervision (2000, revised 2005). www.osteopathic.org/pdf/aoa_postiong-n.pdf (pages 98-104). American Academy of Pediatrics Scope of Practice Issues in the Delivery of Pediatric Health Care (select sections provided) In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of nonphysician pediatric clinicians and an expansion in their respective scopes of practice. This raises critical public policy and child health advocacy concerns. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) believes that optimal pediatric health care depends on a team-based approach with coordination by a physi-cian leader, preferably a pediatrician. The pediatrician is uniquely suited to manage, coordinate, and supervise the entire spectrum of pediatric care, from diagnosis through all stages of treatment, in all practice settings. The AAP recognizes the valuable contributions of nonphysician clinicians, including nurse practitioners and physician assistants, in delivering optimal pediatric care. The AAP also believes that nonphysician clinicians who provide health care services in underserved areas should be sup-ported by consulting pediatricians and other physicians using technologies including telemedicine. Pediatricians 38 Scope of Practice Data Series: Naturopaths Appendixshould serve as advocates for optimal pediatric care in state legislatures, public policy forums, and the media and should pursue opportunities to resolve scope of practice conflicts outside state legislatures. The AAP affirms that as nonphysician clinicians seek to expand their scopes of practice as providers of pediatric care, standards of education, training, examination, regula-tion, and patient care are needed to ensure patient safety and quality health care for all infants, children, adolescents, and young adults. *** In recent years, the role of [complementary and alterna-tive medicine] CAM has also received increased atten-tion. Controversy exists about the efficacy of many of the modalities incorporated under the heading of CAM. Although many definitions exist, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine defines CAM as \"those treatments and health care practices not taught widely in medical schools, not generally used in hospitals, and not usually reimbursed by medical insur - ance companies.\" According to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, \"some approaches are consistent with physiologic principles of Western medicine, while others constitute healing systems with a different origin. Although some therapies are far outside the realm of accepted Western medical theory and practice, others are becoming established in mainstream medicine.\" Although this policy statement will not address the treatments but rather the training of individuals who provide such treatments to children, it is important to note that little scientific evidence exists regarding the safety and efficacy of CAM therapies in children. Indeed, there have been few randomized, controlled, double-blinded clinical trials on the use of CAM thera-pies in the pediatric population. Table 2 summarizes information on 5 of the most common practitioners of CAM. [Only the portion of Table 2 relevant to natur - opaths is included below.] Children may receive care from CAM practitioners without it being revealed to their pediatrician. A 1997 study reported that the percentage of American adults using CAM increased from 34% in 1990 to 42% in 1997. The estimate for CAM use by the general pedi-atric population is lower, ranging from approximately 11% in 1994 to 20% in 1999.The rate for children with chronic or serious illness, however, is much higher, vary-ing according to age, background, and access to services from 30% to more than 70%, according to 1998 data. These figures raise serious concerns. The pediatrician 39 Scope of Practice Data Series: Naturopaths AppendixTABLE 2.

As advocates for their patients, pediatricians need to advise patients and their parents that the interactions between some CAM therapies and conventional medi-cal treatments can cause complications and even death. Many people are unaware of this danger and view CAM therapies as natural and, therefore, safe, and so often do not report their use of CAM to their physicians. The AAP has recognized the importance of this issue and has published a series of recommendations on how to counsel families about CAM use for children with chronic illness or disability. The pediatric community has questioned the ability of CAM practitioners to identify serious or complex medical conditions that require referral to a physician for medical treatment. In addition, the opposition of some CAM practitioners to immunizations negatively affects the health and safety of children in their care. No uniform standards exist across the country for scope of pediatric practice of chiropractors, naturopaths, and other CAM practitioners. As summarized in Table 2, pediatric training and experience are not specifically outlined or regulated. Studies documenting improved outcomes and efficacy of treatments in pediatric prac-tice for CAM practitioners do not exist. In view of this lack of national standards for pediatric care by CAM practitioners, the absence of studies documenting that the quality of health care for children provided by these practitioners is comparable with that provided by con-ventional clinicians, and the more extensive training and education of pediatricians, the AAP has concerns about the provision of health care services to pediatric patients by CAM practitioners. American Medical Association E-3.01 Nonscientific Practitioners It is unethical to engage in or to aid and abet in treat- ment which has no scientific basis and is dangerous, is calculated to deceive the patient by giving false hope, or which may cause the patient to delay in seeking proper care. Physicians should also be mindful of state laws which prohibit a physician from aiding and abetting an unlicensed person in the practice of medicine, aiding or abetting a person with a limited license in providing services beyond the scope of his or her license, or under -taking the joint medical treatment of patients under the foregoing circumstances. Physicians are otherwise free to accept or decline to serve anyone who seeks their services, regardless of who has recommended that the individual see the physician.

D-35.991 Licensure of Naturopaths Our AMA will work through the Scope of Practice Partnership and interested Federation partners to oppose the licensure of naturopaths and report back to the House of Delegates at the 2006 Interim Meeting. (Res. 209, A-06) H-480.964 Alternative Medicine Policy of the AMA on alternative medicine is: (1) There is little evidence to confirm the safety or efficacy of most alternative therapies. Much of the information currently known about these therapies makes it clear that many have not been shown to be efficacious. Well-designed, stringently controlled research should be done to evaluate the efficacy of alternative therapies. (2) Physicians should routinely inquire about the use of alternative or unconventional therapy by their patients, and educate themselves and their patients about the state of scientific knowledge with regard to alternative therapy that may be used or contemplated. (3) Patients who choose alternative therapies should be educated as to the hazards that might result from postponing or stopping conventional medical treatment. (CSA Rep. 12, A-97; Reaffirmed: BOT Rep. 36, A-02) H-480.973 Unconventional Medical Care in the United States Our AMA: (1) encourages the Office of Alternative Medicine of the National Institutes of Health to deter - mine by objective scientific evaluation the efficacy and safety of practices and procedures of unconventional medicine; and encourages its members to become bet-ter informed regarding the practices and techniques of alternative or unconventional medicine; and (2) utilizes the National Institutes of Health's National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine's classifica-tion system of alternative medicine, \"Major Domains of Complementary and Alternative Medicine,\" in order to promote future discussion and research about the effi-cacy, safety, and use of alternative medicine.

(Sub. Res. 306, A-06) H-35.990 Non-Physician Measurement Of Body Func- tions In the public interest, the AMA recommends that non- physicians who perform tests such as blood pressure or blood sugar measurements advise the examinee to com-municate these findings to a licensed physician. (Sub. Res. 59, I-80; CLRPD Rep. B, I-90; Reaffirmed: Sunset Report, I-00) H-200.969 Definition of Primary Care (1) The AMA rejects the definition of primary care as stated in the March 1996 report of the Institute of Med-icine as \"the provision of integrated accessible health care services by clinicians.\" The AMA believes that primary care consists of the provision of a broad range of personal medical care (preventive, diagnostic, palliative, therapeutic, curative, counseling and rehabilitative) in a manner that is accessible, comprehensive and coordi-nated by a licensed MD/DO physician over time. Care may be provided to an age-specific or gender-specific group of patients, as long as the care of the individual patient meets the above criteria. (2) The AMA encour - ages the efforts to define what constitutes primary care services. Data should be collected on which specialties currently provide these services, and how these services are integrated into the practice of physicians. Such data are essential to determine future physician workforce needs in primary care. (3) The AMA encourages that training programs for physicians who will practice pri-mary care include appropriate educational experiences to introduce physicians to the required knowledge and skills, as well as to the types of services and the modes of practice that characterize primary care. (4) Where case management or coordination might limit access to appropriate medical care, patients should have the freedom to see a physician appropriate for the services they need, regardless of specialty. Above all, the best interests of the patient must be paramount.

(Res. 702, A-98; Reaf-firmed: BOT Rep. 36, A-02) H-295.902 Alternative Medicine (1) AMA policy states that courses offered by medi-cal schools on alternative medicine should present the scientific view of unconventional theories, treatments, and practice as well as the potential therapeutic utility, safety, and efficacy of these modalities. (2) Our AMA will work with members of the Federation to convey physicians' and patients' concerns and questions about alternative care to the NIH Office of Alternative Medi-cine and work with them and other appropriate bodies to address those concerns and questions. (CSA Rep. 12, A-97; Appended by Res. 525, A-98) H-480.957 Health Plan Liability for Complementary and Alternative Therapy Requests Our AMA recommends that physicians include indem- nification clauses for CAT referrals in all health plan contracts when such plans require referral for CAT. (BOT Rep. 36, A-02) H-405.969 Definition of a Physician The AMA affirms that a physician is an individual who has received a \"Doctor of Medicine\" or a \"Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine\" degree or an equivalent degree following successful completion of a prescribed course of study from a school of medicine or osteopathic medi-cine.

BMC Complement Altern Med. 2004 Oct 20;4:14.Leslie Dan, faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. heather.boon@utoronto.ca BACKGROUND: Despite the growing use of comple- mentary and alternative medicine (CAM) by consumers in the U.S., little is known about the practice of CAM providers. The objective of this study was to describe and compare the practice patterns of naturopathic phy-sicians in Washington State and Connecticut. METH-ODS: Telephone interviews were conducted with state-wide random samples of licensed naturopathic physicians and data were collected on consecutive patient visits in 1998 and 1999. The main outcome measures were: Sociodemographic, training and practice characteristics of naturopathic physicians; and demo-graphics, reasons for visit, types of treatments, payment source and visit duration for patients. RESULT: One hundred and seventy practitioners were interviewed and 99 recorded data on a total of 1817 patient visits. Natur - opathic physicians in Washington and Connecticut had similar demographic and practice characteristics. Both the practitioners and their patients were primarily White and female. Almost 75% of all naturopathic visits were for chronic complaints, most frequently fatigue, headache, and back symptoms. Complete blood counts, serum chemistries, lipids panels and stool analyses were ordered for 4% to 10% of visits. All other diagnostic tests were ordered less frequently. The most commonly prescribed naturopathic therapeutics were: botanical medicines (51% of visits in Connecticut, 43% Wash-ington), vitamins (41% 43%), minerals and allergy treat-ments (11% and 13%). The mean visit length was about 40 minutes. Approximately half the visits were paid directly by the patient. CONCLUSION: This study provides information that will help other health care providers, patients and policy makers better understand the nature of naturopathic care.PMID: 15496231 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]Characteristics of visits to licensed acupuncturists, chiropractors, massage therapists, and naturopathic physicians Cherkin DC, Deyo RA, Sherman KJ, Hart LG, Street JH, Hrbek A, Davis RB, Cramer E, Milliman B, Booker J, Mootz R, Barassi J, Kahn JR, Kaptchuk TJ, Eisenberg DM. J Am Board Fam Pract. 2002 Nov-Dec;15(6):463-72. Center for Health Studies, Group Health Cooperative, Seattle 98101, USA. BACKGROUND: Despite growing popularity of complementary and alternative medical (CAM) thera-pies, little is known about the patients seen by CAM practitioners. Our objective was to describe the patients and problems seen by CAM practitioners. METHODS: We collected data on 20 consecutive visits to randomly sampled licensed acupuncturists, chiropractors, massage therapists, and naturopathic physicians practicing in Arizona, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Washington. Data were collected on patient demographics, smok-ing status, referral source, reasons for visit, concurrent medical care, payment source, and visit duration. Com-parative data for conventional physicians were drawn from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. RESULTS: In each profession, at least 99 practitioners collected data on more than 1,800 visits. More than 80% of visits to CAM providers were by young and middle-aged adults, and roughly two thirds were by women. Children comprised 10% of visits to natur - opathic physicians but only 1% to 4% of all visits to other CAM providers. At least two thirds of visits resulted from self-referrals, and only 4% to 12% of visits were from conventional physician referrals. Chiro-practors and massage therapists primarily saw musculosk - eletal problems, while acupuncturists and naturopathic physicians saw a broader range of conditions. Visits to acupuncturists and massage therapists lasted about 60 minutes compared with 40 minutes for naturopathic physicians and less than 20 minutes for chiropractors. Most visits to chiropractors and naturopathic physicians, but less than one third of visits to acupuncturists and massage therapists, were covered by insurance. CONCLUSIONS: This information will help inform discussions of the roles CAM practitioners will play in the health care system of the future.PMID: 12463292 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE] 42 Scope of Series: Naturopaths AppendixNaturopathic medicine: what can patients expect?

Center for Holistic Pediatric Education and Research, Chil-dren's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mass. 02115, USA. OBJECTIVE: To describe the practice characteristics and pediatric care of homeopathic practitioners (HPs) and naturopathic doctors (NDs). DESIGN: Cross-sectional, descriptive survey. SETTING: Homeopathic and naturopathic practices in Massachusetts. PARTICI-PANTS: Homeopathic practitioners (N = 42) and NDs (N = 23) identified from the yellow pages, regional and national society membership lists, schools, magazine advertisements, and by word-of-mouth. The response rate was 55% (23/42) for HPs and 65% (15/23) for NDs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographics, prac-tice characteristics, fee structure, and amount of pedi-atric care. Practitioners were asked for their approach to childhood immunizations and to treating a febrile neonate. Data were analyzed using simple descrip-tive statistics. RESULTS: Almost all respondents were white. Among the HPs, 13 (57%) were licensed medical doctors. Naturopathic doctors and HPs reported hav-ing an average of only 25 to 40 patient visits per week, but children and adolescents accounted for up to one third of these visits. Nearly all reported treating chil-dren, but fewer than half of the practitioners reported any formal pediatric training. Initial patient visits typi-cally lasted more than 1 hour and cost $140 to $150. Follow-up visits were scheduled every 4 to 6 weeks and lasted more than 30 minutes on average. Insurance covered less than one third of the patient visits, and sliding scale payments were offered by less than half of the respondents. Most practitioners reported that they did not actively recommend immunizations and fewer than half of the nonphysician practitioners reported that they would refer a 2-week-old neonate with a fever to a medical doctor or emergency medical facility. CONCLUSIONS: Many patients using homeopathy and naturopathy are children. Visits to these providers are frequent and fees are primarily paid out-of-pocket. Failure on the part of these providers to recommend immunizations or recognize potentially serious illnesses is cause for concern.PMID: 10632255 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE] A pilot and feasibility study on the effects of natur - opathic botanical and dietary interventions on sex steroid hormone metabolism in premenopausal womenGreenlee H, Atkinson Biomarkers Prev. 2007 School of Public Health, Columbia University, 7th Floor, 722 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10028, USA. hg2120@columbia.edu Naturopathic physicians commonly make dietary and/ or dietary supplement recommendations for breast cancer prevention. This placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, pilot study tested the effects of two naturopathic interventions over five menstrual cycles on sex steroid hormones and metabolic markers in 40 healthy pre-menopausal women. The intervention arms were as follows: dietary changes (3 servings/d crucifers or dark leafy greens, 30 g/d fiber, 1-2 liters/d water, and limiting caffeine and alcohol consumption to 1 serving each/wk; n = 10), and placebo (n = 15). Early-and late-follicular phase serum samples from cycles 1 and 5 were analyzed for estrogens (estrone, metabolic markers (insulin, insulin-like insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3, and leptin). Serum samples collected during the mid-luteal phase of cycles 1 and 5 were analyzed for total estradiol, free estradiol, and sex hormone-binding globulin. Urine samples collected during the late follicular phase of cycles 1 and 5 were analyzed for 2-hydroxyestrone and 16alpha-hydroxyestrone. During the early follicular phase, compared with placebo, the 43 Scope of Practice Data Series: Naturopaths Appendixbotanical supplement decreased dehydroepiandrosterone (-13.2%; (-14.6%; P = 0.07), androstenedione (-8.6%; P = 0.05), and estrone-sulfate (-12.0%; P = 0.08). No other trends or statistically significant changes were observed. When comparing dietary changes with placebo, no statistically significant differences were observed. Overall, in this pilot study, the naturopathic interventions had no sub-stantial effects on estrogen measures. Early-follicular phase androgens decreased with the botanical supplement.PMID: 17684134 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE] Deaths resulting after administration of edetate disodium: 2003-2005 Brown MJ, Willis T, Omalu B, Leiker R.

T wo were children, both of whom were treated with edetate disodium. At the time of this writing, the adult case was still under investigation. No previous cases of death resulting from hypocalcemia dur - ing chelation have been reported. From our experience and review of the literature, we suggest that health care providers who are unfamiliar with chelation consult an expert before undertaking treatment and that hospital formularies evaluate whether stocking edetate disodium is necessary, given the risk for hypocalcemia and the availability of less toxic alternatives.PMID: 16882789 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE] Why evidence-based Tonelli MR, Callahan TC. Acad Med. 2001 Dec;76(12):1213-20.Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington, USA. tonelli@u.washington.edu The concept of evidence-based medicine (EBM) has been widely adopted by orthodox Western medicine. Proponents of EBM have argued that complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) modalities ought to be subjected to rigorous, controlled clinical trials in order to assess their efficacy. However, this does not represent a scientific necessity, but rather is a philo-sophical demand: promoters of EBM seek to establish their particular epistemology as the primary arbiter of all medical knowledge. This claim is problematic. The methods for obtaining knowledge in a healing art must be coherent with that art's underlying understanding and theory of illness. Thus, the method of EBM and the knowledge gained from population-based studies may not be the best way to assess certain CAM practices, which view illness and healing within the context of a particular individual only. In addition, many alternative approaches center on the notion of non-measurable but perceptible aspects of illness and health (e.g., Qi) that preclude study within the current framework of con-trolled clinical trials. Still, the methods of developing knowledge within CAM currently have limitations and are subject to bias and varied interpretation. CAM must develop and defend a rational and coherent method for assessing causality and efficacy, though not neces-sarily one based on the results of controlled clinical trials. Orthodox medicine should consider abandoning demands that CAM become evidence-based, at least as \"evidence\" is currently narrowly defined, but insist instead upon a more complete and coherent description and defense of the alternative epistemic methods and tools of these disciplines.PMID: 11739043 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE] Complementary and alternative medical treatment of breast cancer: A survey of licensed North American naturopathic physicians Standish LJ, Greene K, Greenlee H, Kim JG, Grosshans C. Altern Ther Health Med. 2002 Jul-Aug;8(4):74-6, 78-81.Bastyr University Research Institute, Kenmore, Wash, USA. CONTEXT: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is on the rise in the United States, espe-cially for breast cancer patients. Many CAM thera-pies are delivered by licensed naturopathic physicians using individualized treatment plans. OBJECTIVE: To describe naturopathic treatment for women with breast cancer. DESIGN: Cross-sectional mail survey in 2 parts: screening form and 13-page survey. SETTING: Bastyr University Cancer Research Center, Kenmore, Wash. PARTICIPANTS: All licensed naturopathic physicians in the United States and Canada (N=1,356) received screening forms; 642 (47%) completed the form. Of the respondents, 333 (52%) were eligible, and 161 completed the survey (48%). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographics of naturopathic physi-cians, development of treatment plans, CAM therapies used, perceived efficacy of therapeutic interventions. 44 Scope of Practice Data Series: Naturopaths AppendixRESULTS: Of those respondents screened, 497 (77%) had provided naturopathic care to women with breast cancer, and 402 (63%) had treated women with breast cancer in the previous 12 months. Naturopaths who were women were more likely than men to treat breast cancer (P < or = .004). Of the survey respondents, 104 (65%) practiced in the United States, and 57 (35%) practiced in Canada; 107 (66.5%) were women, and 54 (33.5%) were men. To develop naturopathic treatment plans, naturopathic physicians most often considered the stage of cancer, the patient's emotional constitu-tion, and the conventional therapies used. To monitor patients clinically, 64% of the naturopathic physicians used diagnostic imaging, 57% considered the patient's quality of life, and 51% used physical examinations. The most common general CAM therapies used were dietary counseling (94%), botanical medicines (88%), antioxidants (84%), and supplemental nutrition (84%). The most common specific treatments were vitamin C Q-10 (34%), MEDLINE] Evidence-based medicine and naturopathy Jagtenberg T, Evans S, Grant A, Howden I, Lewis M, Singer J. J Altern Complement Med. 2006 Apr;12(3):323-8.School of Natural and Complementary Medicine, Southern Cross University, Lismore, Australia. Evidence-based medicine (EBM) has been advocated as a new paradigm in orthodox medicine and as a method-ology for natural medicines, which are often accused of lacking an adequate scientific basis. This paper presents the voices of tradition-sensitive naturopathic practitio-ners in response to what they perceive as an ideologic assault by EBM advocates on the validity and integrity of natural medicine practice. Those natural medicine practices, which have tradition-based paradigms articu-lating vitalistic and holistic principles, may have signifi-cant problems in relating to the idea of EBM as devel-oped in biomedical contexts. The paper questions the appropriateness of imposing a methodology that appears to minimize or bypass the philosophic and methodologi-cal foundations of natural medicine, and that itself seems primarily driven by political considerations.PMID: 16646733 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]Other information on naturopathy \"Findings and Recommendations Regarding the Pre- scribing and Furnishing Authority of a Naturopathic Doctor.\" Bureau of Naturopathic Medicine, California Department of Consumer Affairs. www.naturopathic.ca.gov/formspubs/formulary_report.pdf Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic Practice.

Based out of Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine in Tempe, AZ, this organization is dedicated to furthering and supporting current and future public awareness efforts for naturopathic medi-cine in the United States and Canada. Our members are students of accredited four-year, graduate-level, in-resi-dence naturopathic medical programs. In coordination with the AANP and the accredited naturopathic medi-cal schools, NPAC seeks to further provide resources on the national level to support both federal and states' needs to educate the public and legislators about the importance of naturopathic medicine. We strive to expand public awareness of naturopathic medicine as a viable, affordable option for quality healthcare. As a strong naturopathic student organization, NPAC is an extremely effective vehicle for public health education and community outreach. 2003 testimony before the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics.
