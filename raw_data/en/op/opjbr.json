People often come to me as a last resort when they haven't been able to resolve an [illness](https://askdrgil.com/conditions-treated/) or disease. They tried either on their own or with the help of other physicians without success. I am effective in addressing these \"untreatable\" illnesses because I see the body, mind and spirit as one continuum. I consider a health challenge to be symptomatic of an entire system that has become out of balance. I strive to return the entire system to balance again. As a Portland Naturopathic Physician, I have many tools available to affect healing. While most MDs use only surgery or drugs to treat, I have a wide array of tools. These tools are non-invasive, have few if any side effects, and help people improve their lives. And I keep up with the latest research on [nutrient therapies](https://askdrgil.com/walsh-protocol/), [LENS](https://askdrgil.com/neurofeedback-treatment/), drainage using UNDA numbered compounds and phytogens is among the most celebrated and powerful treatments available. Effective with most patients, even those taking pharmaceuticals, drainage retrains the body to better eliminate toxins and allow the organ systems to work as they were designed. I use this approach when the patient's condition suggests that their body needs help with elimination and/or one or more organ system isn't behaving optimally. Listen to my [podcast](https://askdrgil.com/podcast/480-2/) about elimination to learn more about why it is so important. Counseling With a graduate degree in Counseling Psychology, I make sure every patient is treated in a truly holistic manner. I put great emphasis on the role of emotional and mental wellbeing in the healing of the physical body. General balancing of organ systems Imbalances in one part of the body can create problems in other parts of the body. Knowing where the problem originates is crucial to treating effectively. High blood pressure, for example, is an organ imbalance. Most people think this issue arises from the heart; and sometimes it does. But more often a problem in the kidneys causes a rise in blood pressure. I have the tools to identify and treat the organ system that is out of balance to help stabilize my patient's wellbeing\u2014without using drugs. A form of EEG biofeedback, neurofeedback enables optimization and healing of brain function. Neurofeedback can be a helpful part of treatment for many conditions of mind and body. I use LENS Neurofeedback, because it provides safe, fast, and effective treatment. You can read more about it by clicking the link above or listen to a [podcast](https://askdrgil.com/podcast/need-know-concussion-recovery/) about it. [Heart Rate Variability Training](https://askdrgil.com/need-know-heart-rate-variability-training/) Heart rate variability (HRV) training is a method to improve total health. Moment to moment changes in heart rate reflect our overall health. Using this information, we can increase stress tolerance. HRV biofeedback training allows you to see real-time changes. You can learn how your thoughts affect your nervous system and breathing. You can learn how to improve your response in stressful situations. This results in improved physiological health as hormones, blood pressure, heart rate, and mood come into balance. Nutritional supplements I use various forms of testing to determine what supplements are best for your unique situation. This informs custom treatment plans. I suggest using physician-quality vitamins and minerals to resolve deficiencies and restore health. To help make treatment more affordable, I offer a 15% discount on all supplements. Nutritional therapy Patients facing almost any problem can benefit from individualized dietary recommendations designed to nourish and heal. The [Walsh Protocol](https://askdrgil.com/walsh-protocol/) is an important aspect of my treatment plan. Guided by testing, I can use targeted supplementation to help many mental health conditions including, anxiety, depression, OCD, ADHD, and behavior problems. Self-care treatments In-home treatments designed to increase elimination of toxins and metabolic waste products while restoring optimal organ function can help patients overcome most any problem. Testing When medically necessary, I offer a range of testing to determine the best course of action for treatment, including: Hair Testing Hair testing can help determine the state of the body, such as identifying any problems with heavy metals or elimination of toxins in the body, plus evaluating adrenal and thyroid function. Histamine Testing Histamine testing confirms if the body is using DNA properly and helps identify any mental and physical symptoms related to high or low histamine. Metal Testing By testing levels of copper and zinc in the body, I can better understand the underlying cause of most mental/emotional issues. High copper levels are associated with explosive anger issues, depression, chronic fatigue, fibromylagia, difficult periods and bad PMS. Low zinc levels are associated with many health problems from brittle fingernails and premature graying of hair to depression and immune imbalances. Pyroluria Pyroluria is a term to describe having kryptopyrroles in the urine, which can be an indication of manic-depression, conduct disorder, and poor performance in school. A simple urine test can determine if pyrolurias is the cause of ADD and other issues. Treatment is very simple through the use of appropriate supplements. "}
