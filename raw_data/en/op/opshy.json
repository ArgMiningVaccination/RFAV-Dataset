Article published online: 2021-01-04Introduction Since the end of 2019, the whole world has become affected by an epidemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. By the end of May 2020,more than six million con rmed cases had been reported and about 370,000 deaths. 1At that time, no vaccination was available and no effective therapy had been reported. COVID-19 patients display a wide range of symptoms, but the most frequent are: fever or chills; cough; shortness of body aches; headache; recent loss of taste or smell; sore throat; congestion or runny nose; nausea or vomiting and diar- rhoea.2This range of symptoms makes it dif cult to gain a clear perspective on how homeopathy can be applied in this epidemic. Former epidemics have shown that a limited number of homeopathic medicines can be used in thetreatment of the disease because the symptoms produced by the microorganism predominate over constitutional symptoms. However, with the range of symptoms causedby the infection in different patients we may expect a variety of eligible homeopathic medicines, because the totality of those symptoms does not clearly indicate onesingle homeopathic medicine. An initial selection of homeopathic medicines could be based on the symptomatology of the epidemic by repertor-isation (the repertory is an index to the symptoms of all medicines in the homeopathic materia medica). This, how- ever, results in a large of possible medicines becausesymptoms such as ','loss of smell 'and 'dyspnoea 'are very common, and this results in large repertory rubrics. Alternatively, the choice of possiblemedicines could be based on previous epidemics. 3Other possible criteria could derive from fundamental research, such as the nding that Bryonia alba contains flavonoids which have an inhibitory effect on peroxidase-catalysed oxidation,4relating this to the possible role of the angioten- sin-converting enzyme 2 receptor and protease inhibitors in this disease.5 The most important question, however, is this: What works in daily practice? All over the world, patients have been treated with homeopathy, and case descriptions can be a valuable source of information, particularly if theyshow us which medicines have been used successfully and which symptoms indicate speci c medicines. In this article, we report how a working group of the Liga MedicorumHomeopathica Internationalis (LMHI) collected and ana- lysed cases of COVID-19-like illness. This was not only a process of learning from homeopathic experience but alsoof learning how to collect data and evaluate a new disease. There was no completely worked-out protocol at the outset; this was adapted as data came in. The protocolwas, therefore, also partly a product of learning from experience. We applied modern statistical techniques to assess the data, which were translated into a Bayesianmini-repertory, presented in an app containing a Bayesian algorithm for combining symptoms to differentiate be- tween medicines.Methods The primary objective of our evaluation was to discover the relationship between speci c symptoms and speci c med- icines, especially of symptoms occurring frequently in thisdisease. Such relationships enable a more precise differenti- ation between medicines by applying Bayes 'theorem. We collected, and are still collecting, data from cases with con rmed COVID-19 (by PCR, etc.) and where COVID- 19 is suspected because of a combination of symptomatol- ogy and COVID-19 contact. Clinicians were invited to sub-mit data in any available format (such as text, spreadsheet or database) through every network we could nd. Such networks were: LMHI, European Council for (\u00c4KH), as well as published 6and unpublished case series. Most cases were submitted by the AIH, which use a web-based questionnaire with pre-formatted questions such as 'dry or productive cough ','fever ', as well as free text elds for full case descriptions. Such symptoms were standardised for quanti- tative analysis. Werst undertook a qualitative analysis of each case: Was the illness and reaction to therapy well described? Were homeopathic symptoms well described? Were other (ho- meopathic) therapies prescribed that could have in fluenced outcome? If it appeared likely that a speci c homeopathic medicine was related to the improvement of the patient, the case was entered into an Excel spreadsheet. The qualitativeanalysis was done by author LR; in unclear cases consensus was sought with author PG. The spreadsheet and discussion points were shared with all authors after standardisationof symptoms. Contributors of cases were instructed to anonymise cases and follow ethical guidelines of their coun- tries. Anonymity was also guaranteed by the standardisation of symptoms. In some countries, such as India, ethical clearance was obtained. Generally, ethical clearance andinformed consent were waived because the data analysis was based on registration of normal daily practice. The use of anonymised data is in agreement with the European DataProtection Law (EU) (2016/679, article 89). 7The spreadsheet contained some pre-de ned variables to categorise each anonymised case (patient code, gender, age, country, practi-tioner), the prescribed medicine, the severity of the case, laboratory con rmation, prescribed medicine, time to onset of improvement and presence or absence of fever and resultof the medicine. Symptoms not corresponding to any of those pre-formatted were initially entered in cells as free text. Many of the unformatted symptoms were complex. A symptom such as 'Headache, worse during the night 'had to be split into the symptom 'Headache 'and the sub-symptom 'Headache, worse during the night ', to allow all cases with headache to be counted separately. The next step was to standardise symptoms with synonymous descriptors: for ex- ample, of the symptom 'fatigue '.T h e 'fatigue 'in COVID-19 cases is more than straightforward tiredness, and several different expressions such as 'prostration ','heaviness 'and 'weakness ' were used by different practitioners.

'fatigue 'because it was the most frequently used, for example, by the World Health Organization. The project began in March 2020, at which time there were few data and the contributors generally had no experience of data collection. A newsletter was sentfrequently to the contributors, giving instructions, showing results and providing feedback. The basic principles of a Bayesian repertory, applying likelihood ratio (LR), wereexplained step-by-step using data from the case collection. The collected data were also used to demonstrate sources of bias. A growing list of symptoms that appeared in manycases was added to the pre-de ned variables of the spread- sheet and contributors were asked to check these symptoms in every patient. The outcome of qualitative and quantita-tive analysis of the spreadsheet was disseminated among LMHI members. Cases were collected and analysed on a weekly basis and new synonyms were merged. These data suf ced to calculate the constituents of the LR; LR \u00bc(a/(a\u00fec))/(b/(b \u00fed)): a\u00bcThe number of patients in the population responding well to the medicine with the symptom. b\u00bcThe number of patients in the remainder of the population with the symptom. c\u00bcThe number of patients in the population responding well to the medicine without the symptom.d\u00bcThe number of patients in the remainder of the population without the symptom. The 95% con dence interval (CI) of some LRs was calcu- lated with Con dence Interval Analyser (BMJ). To facilitate the necessary calculations for a combination of symptoms, an app was developed, calculating the com-bined LRs. The app was built using Web flow, which allows the programmer to build the app visually using its editor. The part of the app that combines LRs to recommend medicines uses JavaScript, as this allows the calculations to take place immediately on the user 's device rather than the distant server. This also allows us to use Netlify, a cloud computing company which distributes the website globally, providing the fastest response wherever the user is in the world.Additionally, hosting on Netlify is free of charge. The combi- nation of Web flow\u00feJavaScript \u00feNetlify allowed us to pro- duce the website quickly and ensure that it operates with the greatest global speed. The app was also designed to be easy to update with further symptoms, medicines and data. The app was tested with a published case series of 18 cases. 6Out of these 18 cases, 17 had been prescribed medicines that were included in the database underlyingthe app, whilst one had received another medicine. The question was: Does the use of only the most frequently occurring symptoms in an initial screening give results thatare consistent with the outcome of the standard homeo- pathic method using all available symptoms, common and particular? We also calculated a correlation matrix betweeneach of the symptoms of the app using Pearson 'sc o n t i n - gency coef cient. Patients By the end of May 2020, 161 patients (91 females, 58 males and 12 unknown gender) were included from Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Iran, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey and the United States. Agerange: 0 to 84 years. Results By the end of May, 161 cases had been collected, for whom 31homeopathic medicines were prescribed. The most pre-scribed total), Phos and Camph another 14.9%. Six medicines had 3 to 6 cases, four medicines had two cases and 16 medicines one single case each. The total number of symptoms recorded was 1404. Symptoms from various sources were rst entered in free text cells, as shown in Fig. 1 . If necessary, symptoms with modalities were split into symptom and sub-symptom.

The semantic clean-up was the most laborious task, reducing over a thousand different symptoms to a fewhundred. There was a risk of missing nuances in this process, but our main goal was to locate common symptoms. After the clean-up process, a pivot table indicated the frequency ofeach symptom and the number of medicines related to the symptom. From this, the LRs of each symptom for the respective medicines could be calculated, resulting in a'mini-repertory 'for three homeopathic medicines, see Table 1 . The 95% CI of some LRs is shown in Table 2 .S t a t i s t i c a l signicance at a 95% level, however, is only partly related to clinical relevance.8In the present context, the fact that some LRs are statistically signi cant indicates that a sample con- taining at least 20 subjects who respond to a particular medicine gives reasonably accurate estimates. There are signi cant differences between this mini-rep- ertory and the well-known rubrics of the existing homeo- pathic repertory. Firstly, the entries are not based on absolute occurrence. This would have resulted in boldfacetypeface for most entries because of the repeated clinicalconrmation. Secondly, the data for the three medicines are compared with each other and are only valid for COVID-19-like disease; the LRs are 'condition dependent '. 9This can result in LRs of less than 1, indicating a relative contraindi- cation. For example, the LRs below 1 linking A rsand Brywith 'fatigue 'do not indicate that these medicines are notindicat- ed for COVID-19 by this symptom, but rather that fatigue indicates Gels (LR\u00bc1.62) more than average, whilst Ars (LR\u00bc0.96) and Bry(LR\u00bc0.77) are indicated less than aver- age when the three prescribed medicines are compared. This mutual comparison of those medicines indicated by a diseaseis the third departure from the existing repertory. The result is that rather than simply giving boldface entries for all three medicines, this repertory is able to show a distinctiveordering of the three. This ordering of individual symptoms can result in even larger differences between medicines when symptoms arecombined by multiplying the respective LRs. Table 3 shows composite LRs for three combinations of three symptoms. The composite LRs demonstrate that repertory entries basedon LR values can differentiate medicines much better than Table 1 Mini repertory for Arsenicum ,Bryonia and Gelsemium regarding COVID-19-like illness.

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. the same based on absolute occurrence, thus making com- mon symptoms more useful. Let us assume that the (unknown) prior chance that any of the three medicines would work is 10%. A combination ofthree common symptoms could then raise this chance for a speci c medicine to between 40 and 60%, further highlight- ing the contrast with the other medicines (see Table 4 ). The systematic collection of treatment data and applica- tion of Bayes 'theorem to calculate LRs allows relatively common symptoms to differentiate better between medi- cines, and this is enhanced by the combination of these symptoms. However, combining LRs requires a calculator,and it will be some time before computer-based repertories are able to perform the necessary calculations. To overcome this problem, authors TS, GI and LR have created an app thatperforms these calculations based on actual clinical data. The app presents 20 symptoms for which LRs have been measured in COVID-19 cases, giving suggestions for eligiblemedicines from those symptoms chosen; with the currently available data, the medicines are currently con ned to Arsenicum ,Bryonia and Gelsemium . Symptoms were selected to be included in the app, which differentiated between these three medicines even if the LRs were not statisticallysignicant. If data were not available, the LR was set at 1, giving neither an indication nor a contraindication. The app can be found with the following link: https://hpra. co.uk/. A print of the screen for symptom selection is shown in Fig. 2 . The app appears as a 'black box 'with simply input and output, but that is only because it would be too complicated to show the full underlying algorithm and repertory rubrics. The app is based on the data shown in Table 1 , published in the LMHI newsletter, and it shows a positive indication if the combined LR /C213. As a rule of thumb, LR \u00bc3 corresponds to a rise of posterior chance of about 20%. If the combined LR liesbetween 3 and 6, the medicine will appear in plain type; if combined LR is between 6 and 10, the medicine appears in italics; if combined LR /C2110 the medicine appears in boldface type. Testing the App with Real Cases A collection of case studies from Hong Kong (see reference 6) involving COVID-19 was published with 18 cases; these responded well to Ars(one case), Bry(four cases), Gels (12 cases) and Eupatorium perfoliatum (Eup-p) (one case).6The cases were presented with clear descriptions of background, symptomatology and outcome. This, as well as the fact that allcases except one responded to the medicines present in the app, offered an opportunity to test the app with the symptoms seen in these cases. The comparison of the standard case taking and the app can be demonstrated by case HK1.1. The observed symptoms in the case taking were: 1. Slow onset and progression of symptoms. 2. Feeling irritable from the cough; does not want to talk to anyone. Prefers to be alone. 3. Obvious increase in thirst with desire to drink warm water in large quantity. 4. Generally ameliorated after perspiration. 5. Mainly dry cough, with very occasional greenish sputum. 6. Extremely bad pulsating headache in the temple, and middle chest pain aggravated from coughing. 7. Cough aggravated by talking and lying down, and after waking up in the morning. 8. Cough associated with tickling feeling in the throat, ameliorated by warm drinks. Out of these eight complex symptom descriptions, con- sisting of 13 different single repertory symptoms, ve single symptoms could be found in the app: 1. Thirst 2. Dry cough 3. Headache4.

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. The output of the app was 'Strong indication for Bryonia ' and this was indeed the medicine that was prescribed by the clinician. An experienced homeopathic practitioner wouldprobably recognise the medicine at rst sight because of symptoms such as 'irritable from cough ','aversion to com- pany ','thirst for large quantities 'and 'headache from cough ', which are not included in the app. However, with the combination of three symptoms, 'thirst ','dry cough 'and 'headache ', the app would already have returned a 'Moderate indication for Bryonia '. This results from the following LRs for Bry:L for thirst; LR \u00bc1.43 and LR\u00bc1.41 for headache. The combined LR for these three symptoms is 3.31 /C21.43/C21.41\u00bc6.67, high enough for a 'moderate a combined LR\u00bc35.4, representing a strong indication. The outcome of testing all cases is shown in Table 5 .I f the combined LR of the selected symptoms was between 3 and 6, the indication was 'slight '; if the combined LR was between 6 and 10, the indication was 'moderate ';a n di f combined LR >10, the indication was 'strong '. This set of cases contained only one case (HK5.5) that could not be handled by the app, because it contained no datafor that particular medicine ( Eup-p ). In this case, the app gave only slight indications, but did not contradict the choice based on a full homeopathic evaluation by offering a moder-ate or strong indication for one of its own medicines. In the remaining 17 cases, for 11 (65%) the recommenda- tion of the app was entirely consistent with the full homeo-pathic evaluation, giving a moderate or strong indication for the prescribed medicine. In one case (HK5.2), a second medicine came up to the same degree; in this case, a speci c symptom, 'coldness up and down the back '(not available in the app), clari ed the choice of Gels. In three cases (HK2.1, HK4.2, HK4.3), the recommendation was consistent but withonly a slight indication; it did not, though, contradict the denitive choice. In these cases, the full evaluation clari ed the choice because of speci c symptoms. In one case (HK5.4),the recommendation of the app slightly contraindicated the choice after standard case taking which was made on the basis of speci c symptoms, such as 'Heaviness of the eyelids ', which clearly indicated the prescribed medicine. In one other case (HK5.3) both the app and the repertorisation placed Bry rst, but Gels was chosen on the whole picture. To summa- rise: in 16 out of 17 cases, the app made the same recom- mendation as the repertorisation, but using fewer symptoms and only common ones. Discussion The LMHI coordinated case collection from various sources in different formats, partly formatted as repertorisations, part- ly as pre-de ned symptoms, and partly in free text format. In the course of this process, more information became avail- able about common symptoms of the disease and contrib-utors were guided by more pre-de ned symptoms. Such a database can be an invaluable source of both qualitative and quantitative information. For this article, we focused onquantitative aspects, but the selection of suitable cases also required a qualitative analysis to identify those cases where a curative effect appeared likely. Amongst otherfactors, cases could not be used in this analysis where more than one homeopathic medicine had worked, as we sought to establish relationships between speci c medicines and speci c symptoms. Nevertheless, such cases can be useful in a more qualitative context. Cases where a causal relationship between improvement and the medicine wasunclear were also excluded, but again these can be useful for other analyses, as can cases where there is no improvement. Limitations of the Study This data collection should be regarded as a learning project; it began with little knowledge about the disease-speci cs y m p - toms and with largely inexperienced contributors. There was no worked-out protocol and most symptoms were collected retrospectively. As the number of cases increased, directions Fig. 2 Screenshot of the COVID-19 mini-repertory app. Explanation of symptoms could be obtained by clicking on the question mark to the right of the symptom.

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. for data collectionwere adjusted and communicated, and more symptoms were identi ed prospectively. This analysis of observational data cannot be used as proof for the effectiveness of homeopathy. Whilst we made some effort to discard cases where a causal relationship between the medicine and improvement was unlikely, context effects andspontaneous recovery cannot be ruled out. False positive cases, where the improvement is caused by spontaneous recovery or context effects, result in an under-estimation of the LR. 10On the other hand, the retrospective assessment of most symp- toms could involve con rmation bias: some symptoms are well-known indicators for speci c medicines, such as 'heavi- ness of eyelids 'forGels. Heaviness of eyelids was recorded in seven out of 25 Gels cases and not in the remainder of the population; it is possible that the symptom was present butremained unnoticed if Gelshad not been considered. The riskof conrmation bias is greater in the case of keynote symptoms and this could cause over-estimation of LRs. 11 A further potential bias arises from the fact that the multiplication of LRs assumes that these are independent, when in actuality some symptoms are correlated, and thiscould potentially give rise to arti cially in flated LR products. An examination of the correlation matrix of the 20 symptomsusing Pearson 's contingency coef cient, C, revealed that of the 190 possible pair-wise correlations, most (158, 83.2%) were statistically non-signi cant, and of those that were signi cant, all were relatively small (C /C200.26) except one. This latter was between thesymptoms 'Chest pain 'and 'Chest pain aggravated by cough '(C\u00bc0.51); as a result, 'Chest pain 'was subsequently removed from the app, leaving 19 symptoms. Implementing a multivariate procedure in the app to eliminate this potential bias was beyond the scope of the current project, but it isintended to include this in future versions. It is worth noting that this correlation between symptoms is also a problem in the existing repertory 12and homeo- pathic practitioners have to handle this intuitively: e.g. they will be careful in combining symptoms where correlation can be expected, such as 'dry mouth 'and 'thirst '. (In our data, these two symptoms showed a signi cant but relatively small correlation, C \u00bc0.20.) The urgency of this project prevented proper preparation and probably introduced some bias. Nevertheless, counting the prevalence of symptoms and estimating LR resulted in better differentiation between medicines with commonsymptoms, a differentiation that would be absent with the existing typology in repertory rubrics. The data collection showed that a very limited number of medicines appearedrepeatedly in improved cases \u2014Ars,Bryand Gelsin 57.5% of all cases. These three medicines have a considerably higher prior chance of being curative than other medicines. Adding two orthreefurther medicines might suf cefor about 70% ofall cases. The reliability of the Bayesian mini-repertory with 20 common symptoms and three medicines, based on our data,has been tested with 18 real cases and showed results similar to conventional case-taking that relied on considerably more symptoms, both common and speci c. We expect therefore that a Bayesian repertorisation using a limited number of common COVID-19 symptoms could improve the effective-ness of homeopathic COVID-19 treatment, especially if there are no speci c symptoms to indicate particular medicines. This effectiveness could be further improved by adding twoor three more medicines to the existing app after acquiring additional data. The database underlying the app is derived from mostly mild cases. It is uncertain whether severe cases, for instance those with pneumonia, would respond to the same medi- cines. If it transpires that more severe cases are successfullytreated with other homeopathic medicines the app must be adapted, or a separate app for severe (pneumonia) cases must be developed. Conclusion The pandemic outbreak of a new infectious disease offered the opportunity to develop new repertory rubrics of homeopathic symptoms de novo , using up-to-date statistical methods and worldwide data collection. Despite certain biases arising from the urgency of the project and the dynamic nature of adjust- ments to the protocol, important differences between LRs forTable 5 Recommendations of the app after entering the symptoms available in 18 cases6 Case Prescribed medicineNo. repertorysymptomsNo. app number of symptoms described for each case.

For a reference set of cases, a computer algorithm based on LRsof 20 common symptoms and three medicines gave the same results as a full homeopathic evaluation, despite being based upon considerably fewer, and common, symptoms. This tooloffers valuable support and more precise selection of medi- cines to the homeopathic practitioner. Conflict of Interest T.
