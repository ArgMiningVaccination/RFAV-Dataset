That is, Ayurvedic medicines make use of natural herbs, extracts, and plants. One of the advantages of Ayurveda over allopathy is that the herbs and plants that it uses do not have side effects that mimic allopathic medicine. Allopathic medicine is made in labs and every allopathic medicine comes with side effects that may range from mild to severe. In Ayurvedic medicine, this is not the case because all the remedies are naturally made with natural ingredients that don't cause devastating effects on your health. Ayurveda's focus is not limited to providing solutions when a problem has risen. Ayurveda is about providing remedies for optimal health so you don't have those problems, to begin with. Ayurveda is based on the principle that prevention is better than cure. This contrasts with allopathic medicine which focuses on reducing the symptoms and treating them. This is where Ayurveda is a clear winner, because Ayurveda focuses on the root cause that has led to the health problem and then provides remedies accordingly. Ayurveda provides a holistic healing approach that ensures the problem is removed from the root rather than just targeting symptoms as is the case with allopathy. One of the advantages of Ayurveda over allopathy is how accurate the diagnosis is in comparison to allopathic medicine. In allopathic medicine, your doctor will order a wide variety of tests and if he is unable to find the cause then he will order more. This can quickly add up costs before you know it. Ayurveda takes a completely different approach and looks at your doshas to check for any imbalances. When your body is out of balance, ailments will occur. Depending on the imbalance, the health condition can be minor or major. In Ayurveda, diagnosis is accurate and is cheaper when compared to allopathic medicine. It is possible for drug resistance to occur with the overuse of allopathic medicines and this cannot be ignored when talking about Ayurveda vs allopathy. When allopathic medicines are continuously used because of their 'quick fix' nature, their efficacy can eventually diminish. The medicines that were used a decade ago aren't as useful and effective today because of how the bacterial strains have evolved to resist the drug made to destroy them. Ayurveda, because of its nature-based solutions, is more successful as it utilizes herbs that can remedy the root issue. Using Ayurvedic treatment, you don't have to worry about resistance. Focus of Treatment In allopathic treatment, the doctors concentrate on the disease's symptoms and not on the root cause. In other words, Allopathy offers only a partial cure. Ayurveda follows the \"Five Great Elements\" theory. As per the methodology, elements like Prithvi, Jal, Agni, Vayu, and Vyom should be in harmony with the 'fault,' 'tissue' and the 'impurity.' Moreover, Ayurveda focuses on the balance between the three doshas (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha) and holistic wellness. Individual line of treatment If two people are suffering from the same disease in Allopathy, both will be treated with the same medicines whereas, in Ayurveda, medication is based on the individual Completely Natural There are side effects of Allopathy, and some of them are long-lasting. However, Ayurvedic medicines are made from natural ingredients and are generally harmless. It is entirely pure made from the extract of certain fruits, vegetables, and spices and will improve your natural immunity. Permanent cure Ayurveda aims to cure the disease permanently. It supports a better lifestyle through which you can improve your overall health. Allopathy destroys the germs but doesn't ensure that the disease will be cured permanently. Less expensive Ayurvedic medicines are safe and less expensive than allopathic medicines. It provides long-lasting relief and cures the symptoms. On the other hand, Allopathic medicines are costly. They are made from the chemicals which may have adverse effects on our body. Works for chronic diseases Despite its advanced system of medical treatment, Allopathy still is unable to cure diseases like Piles, Rheumatoid arthritis, Jaundice and many more. But, Ayurveda has successfully been able to heal and manage these diseases. Philosophy of Ayurveda The Ayurvedic way of life believes in providing holistic wellness by preventing the disease. On the other hand, Allopathy follows Hypothesis, Experimentation, Observation and Conclusion, which is more symptomatic.
