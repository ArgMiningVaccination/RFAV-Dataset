Introduction The purpose of this document is to define standards for the collection of provider data elements. A Provider is defined as a person or organization that performs services or provides goods of interest to the health sector. A provider can be an individual and/or a team of providers, an organization or a group of organizations. In the context of the Alberta Provider Directory (ABPD), it mea ns Provider in a role. As a participating member of the Western Health Information Collaborative (WHIC), Alberta has agreed to implement the Alberta Provider Directory using the same standards, designs, documentation, and where feasible, computer applicat ion programs resulting from this project. The adoption of the WHIC Data Standard will facilitate and enhance data sharing, analysis, and comparability across functional, jurisdictional, or geographical boundaries. Currently, analysis that goes beyond tradi tional program area boundaries can be time consuming, cumbersome and a significant manual effort. This is due to the multiple definitions and identifiers currently in use. The WHIC partners are committed to using existing standards wherever possible in the development of PRS. WHIC considers data and messaging standards as fundamental to interoperability and the EHR. The WHIC Provider Registry and ABPD Implementation Team will: 1. Use existing, relevant national and provincial standards as a starting point w hen developing provider data standards. 2. Draft provider data standards including business, technical, coding, and privacy requirements. 3. Compare the Provider Directory data model against the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) conceptual health data model and the Health Level 7 (HL7) Reference Information Model. 4. Compare the Provider Directory data model against the HISCA accepted data standards. 5. Create common data definitions and a database design that can be implemented within the four participating WHIC provinces. HEALTH INFORMATION STANDARDS COMMITTEE FOR ALBERTA STAKEHOLDER - PROVIDER DATA SET AUGUST 9, 2018 \u00a9 20 18 Govern ment of Alberta 7 of 178 II. Background There is wide spread interest and an identified need by the health community in all the provinces and territories for a comprehensive data standard and a central registry of providers. The standard and registry would provi de the information and infrastructure to meet the needs of the evolving regionalized health services systems, and each jurisdictional ministry's role within their respective health systems. The accurate and unique identification of providers through a centralized Provider Directory system is one of the fundamental building blocks of the Electronic Health Record. Today, numerous provider registries take many forms, each supporting proprietary identification schemes and several interfaces to obtain and shar e the data. Typically numerous provider registries exist within government and within a single health authority. In many instances providers are not identified uniquely and do not retain identifiers over their \"service life\". Identifiers are different across departments, facilities, health authorities, programs and agencies. A registry of providers like Alberta Provider Directory is one of the foundational components needed to support the healthcare system. In the health system, there is a notion of a Cli ent or patient who is the recipient of a service, a Provider who is the party in the role performing the service, and an intervention which describes/details the service. The Place describes where services or goods are delivered or received. A Facility is a combination of physical, financial, and/or human resources that are used to provide or receive health related services. Some examples of Provider include: Health Care Services Physicians (M.D. and D.O.) Behavioural Health and Social Service Providers Chiropractors Dental Service Providers Dietary and Nutritional Service Providers Emergency Medical Service Providers Eye and Vision Services Providers Nursing Service Providers Pharmacy Service Providers Physician Assistants Podiatric Medicine and Surgery S ervice Providers Respiratory, Rehabilitative and Restorative Service Providers Speech, Language and Hearing Service Providers Technologists, Technicians and Other Technical Service Providers Suppliers of Goods Pharmaceutical Companies Medical Supply Companies Computer Companies Administrative Service Providers HEALTH INFORMATION STANDARDS COMMITTEE FOR ALBERTA STAKEHOLDER - PROVIDER DATA SET AUGUST 9, 2018 \u00a9 20 18 Govern ment of Alberta 8 of 178 Organizational Providers Organizations such as Health Authorities managing facilities such as Hospitals, Laboratories, Nursing Homes The Ministry of Health as an organization providing services suc h as Human Resources, Finance and Accounting There is a diverse technological and provider records infrastructure among the major stakeholders within Alberta's health environment. Most of the data elements that are currently being collected differ in their formats from organization to organization, and application to application. In addition, these data elements may be maintained in more than one place within a Health Authority using different definitions or collected on systems that cannot be linked. A standardized data set promotes the use of a common vocabulary that will increase comparability, reduce redundant data collection and promote communications across jurisdictions and inter -provincially. Since the objective of defining a data set is to cons istently share information, standards for collecting and exchanging data (message standards) have to be suggested and standards for classification (taxonomies) have to be established. Business Case for the Health System The following section identifies the key business benefits to the health system as the result of a successful implementation of the Alberta Provider Directory. Essential Building Block for an Electronic Health Record An EHR will improve the delivery of patient care and facilitate administ rative efficiencies. It is a high priority for Advisory Committee on Health Infostructure (ACHI), the Conference of Deputy Ministers, and Canada Health Infoway, which received funding from the federal government for health infostructure projects. The Alberta Provider Directory (ABPD) is one of the fundamental building blocks towards the realization of the pan- Canadian EHR. It will provide a trusted source of core provider data to facilitate the transmission of health information between authorized organizations and health service providers. Infrastructure to Support Distribution of Health Information The ABPD will employ a unique identifier for each provider in a role, to help ensure the appropriate exchange of private and sensitive health information and to facilitate access to health information by providers having a legitimate \"need -to-know\". ABPD will be a trusted source for provider data. ABPD will follow an approved and accepted data standard and can only be accessed by an approved method for data exchange. These standards will enhance interoperability and streamline information exchange. Information exchange will assist in resolving today's health care issues. Reduction of Health Care Sector Costs The health care sector uses provider information. Today, organizations utilize resources to obtain, convert and enter provider data to their computer systems. HEALTH INFORMATION STANDARDS COMMITTEE FOR ALBERTA STAKEHOLDER - PROVIDER DATA SET AUGUST 9, 2018 \u00a9 20 18 Govern ment of Alberta 9 of 178 The following cost reduction benefits are anticipated with this project: Maintenance - when ABPD is used by a majority of health service provider s, there will be a significant reduction in the time and effort required to maintain provider information. There are many production systems containing provider datasets. The need for duplication is minimized with a centralized source of truth. Other cost savings include minimizing the efforts required to keep systems current and reducing the risk of incorrect information propagating through the health system. Proprietary systems - private software vendors have indicated their support of the Provider D irectory initiative. The Provider Directory will enable them to develop and maintain a single interface for provider information; and reduce the difficulties and costs of obtaining provider information from multiple sources. This project will ensure the standard is spread across several provinces. The larger the market, the more likely vendors will be agreeable to modifying their software products to conform to the Provider Data Standard. Design and development - If the cost to design and build a central Provider Directory is incurred only once, savings can be achieved in nine other provinces, three territories and nationally should these jurisdictions decide to implement the same solution. New systems development - new health care systems continue to be planned, built and operated. Many of these systems carry the following costs related to provider information that may be avoided or reduced with a central provider directory: Analyzing provider data requirements Addressing privacy issues Determining standards for data storage and transmission Addressing technical issues for interoperability (message standards, authentication, and authorization) Procuring and maintaining data Developing electronic interfaces Reusability - The Alberta Provider Directory has been designed to be flexible and portable, to meet multi -provincial requirements. This positions the directory to be reusable for other registries such as client, location, facility and service. Improved Data Security and Privacy Benefits to security and privacy are anticipated through this project and include the following: Opportunity to include modern security technologies such as encryption and authentication in the design Ability to identify active providers through their registering body (authori zed source) Provide the means to restrict health data transmissions to providers who are active on the Provider Registry and to authorized recipients Enable the use of digital certificates and electronic signatures where appropriate Improve accountability Implement \"need to know\" access rules. Provider Directory data such as 'province', 'role', 'speciality', will be used to determine which components of the EHR an authorized consumer may access. HEALTH INFORMATION STANDARDS COMMITTEE FOR ALBERTA STAKEHOLDER - PROVIDER DATA SET AUGUST 9, 2018 \u00a9 20 18 Govern ment of Alberta 10 of 178 Enhanced Patient Care The following benefits to patient c are are expected as a result of this project: Timely delivery of test results and other health information to the correct provider address, reducing diagnostic intervals from weeks to days and speeding up patient treatment Accurate identification of providers across a patient's continuum of care Timely access to provider and patient data by identified, authorized consumers Enabled inter -provider communications for referral, Telehealth and research Provision of and enhanced confidence in data fundamental to the EHR Enable enhanced co -ordination efforts for delivery of emergency services during disasters. Benefits of Collaboration This project has successfully demonstrated that collaboration across regional and provincial domains can work and yield benefits . Examples include: Reduced development costs by sharing costs of common activities More robust deliverables Multi -provincial input and agreement on standards Paving the way for the cross -jurisdictional communication of health information, addressing the access requirements and privacy concerns of all the jurisdictions involved Establishing a process that will eventually provide practitioners access to the health records of Canadians regardless of jurisdiction of residence Increasing the leverage of jurisdi ctional standards within the software vendor community A more widely accepted end product Increased ability to secure external funding. Impact on Privacy, Confidentiality and Security A Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) has been completed. It is currently undergoing an amendment with the latest release of ABPD. A preliminary assessment of the data to be populated from the Source organizations and utilized by the Consumers organizations has found that the data has the potential to fall under the governance of the following legislation: The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) Health Information Act (HIA) Health Professions Act (HPA) Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIPP) HEALTH INFORMATION STANDARDS COMMITTEE FOR ALBERTA STAKEHOLDER - PROVIDER DATA SET AUGUST 9, 2018 \u00a9 20 18 Govern ment of Alberta 11 of 178 Relationships to existing standards and/or legislation Version 1.0 of the Provider Data Standard was approved by the BC Health Information Standards Council (BCHISC) in October 2001. This data standard describes Provider in a health care context and it further defines one subset of P rovider, namely Licensed Individual Provider. The key component standards and subject area conventions referenced included: Health Level Seven (HL7) - Approved BC Standard TCP/IP - Approved BC Standard Health Registry Data Standard - Approved BC Standard HNSecure - BC convention for transport of data to and from non -Ministry organizations HISCA Stakeholder Basic Demographic Data Standard 1.0 HISCA Stakeholder Demographic Data Standard Version 2.1 HISCA Stakeholder - Provider Data Set Version 1.0 In addition, the following sources were used to develop the details on the records and the attributes for the Licensed Individual Provider data standard. Health Level 7 (HL7) has defined a logical data model based on the HL7 electronic data interchange standard. Th e concept of Provider within HL7 is focused on EDI message exchange. The Canadian Pharmaceutical Association (CPhA) data standard provides a simplified and common format for processing prescription drug claims. The concept of Provider within CPhA is focus ed on EDI message exchange. The Ministry of Health used the CPhA standard in the PharmaNet application used by Pharmacare. A provider table is maintained in the PharmaNet system. Most of its Licensed Individual Provider data is supplied and maintained by t he appropriate regulatory body. The Ministry of Health in Manitoba has a conceptual data model for a future provider registry. It was used to verify this data model. Alberta has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) as a member of WHIC. Under the MOU, it is the intention of Alberta to adopt the PRS application and the resulting data standards (under the name of Alberta Provider Directory) as is and endeavour to mitigate compliance issues as a result of this approach.
