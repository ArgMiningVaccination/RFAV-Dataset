If you've ever brought a child into a clinical setting, you've likely witnessed apprehension associated with the experience. And if you haven't, maybe your own childhood memories conjure up this feeling. No matter how great the hospital, it's not a place a child wants to be \u2014 and many of our young patients are repeat visitors. So anything we can do to improve their experience is very important. They say you never get a second chance to make a first impression, but if you've had the chance to visit our new children's hospital lobby, you know that we don't need a second chance. While still technically a \"hospital-within-a-hospital, \" our children's hospital hardly feels that way anymore. Primary-colored panels on the building's exterior, a dedicated entrance, an interactive video wall, elaborate flooring, children's artwork and its own elevators are just a few new features that make the children's hospital more welcoming. Whether young patients come in through the new entrance or the Pediatric E.R., they will know they are in a place created for them. While the renovations and d\u00e9cor won't eliminate all their fears, the atmosphere will welcome families and ease their anxiety. And we're not yet finished. Plans to incorporate themes \u2014 such as the Pediatric E.R. 's \"under the sea\" or the Pediatric Cardiac ICU's \"sunshine, treetops and sky\" themes \u2014 in other children's care areas are in the works. While U.S. News & World Report's 2014-15 Best Children's Hospital rankings confirmed that our children's hospital's services are among the nation's elite \u2014 ranking seven of our 10 pediatric specialties in their Top 50 \u2014 it's great to see that it's quickly becoming one of the nation's best-looking children's hospitals as well. If you haven't seen the new children's hospital welcome area, we encourage you to stop by, or visit blueprints.UFHealth.org for photos, videos and details.

We make it a priority to gather information from UF Health Shands staff to help assess how well we're doing to create a work environment that supports you. We all want to do our best work and enjoy the process. In addition to our focus on the patient experience, we want you to have your best experience as an employee at UF Health. Each one of us impacts each other's personal and overall experience. It's important for us to improve the workplace together. Results of the spring survey are being shared and people have spoken \u2014 in fact, over 70 percent of our colleagues have spoken. Y ou've told us we're making strides but there's room to do better, to make more progress. Y ou're confident about how we make patient safety and quality care a prior - ity. Y ou let us know that organization-wide communication and teamwork are getting better. Y ou're confident in our leaders, and you've told us we are still a competitive employer when it comes to wages, benefits and career opportunities. But we have more strides to make in physician-staff rela-tions, and we must continue to focus on delivering safe, quality care as well as exemplary hospitality and service. We need to continue our momentum making this a great place not just for patients \u2014 but also for each other. Now it's time to discuss results at the unit level. My sincere hope is that all the nearly 9,000 UF Health Shands staff will participate with managers to look at survey results and offer feedback and ideas \u2014 and then take action. We've all got to be accountable, to be part of the process. We need you on this journey. When you meet as a department to discuss a plan of action, join the conversation. Help us collaborate bet-ter, problem-solve together, remove silos of 'us' and 'them' and take the next steps. Some of our teams have done a fantastic job improving operations and communications in their units, based on last year's results. They have made engagement a focus. In previous editions of this newsletter, we've shared stories of nurse managers leading the way, for example. Staff engage-ment is good for everyone and it brings teams together. We need to celebrate these accomplishments and learn from each other. This fall we're also asking you to enroll in Hospitality and Service training, and to start to prac- tice new Standards of Behavior. This approach will take us a step further and help us think about ways we serve each other and our patients and customers. Please know that your executive leaders and managers have made a commitment to support engagement, hospitality and service. We've promised to \"walk the talk\" and participate with you. When we're all part of the solution, we can continue to make this an even better place.

The dis-tinctive, bold primary color palette on the exterior provides an entrance way to the elaborate new lobby, which evokes a calming and hospitable atmosphere and a pleasant distraction for our pediatric patients and their loved ones. The vibrant Sebastian Ferrero Atrium is the latest milestone in UF Health's plans to expand patient-centric pediatric health and wellness services by capitalizing on existing strengths and committing necessary resources to deliver enhanced pediatric services. Investments have been focused on meeting the specific needs of pediatric patients, their families and the commu-nity; adopting a more patient and family centered integrated care model; and growing the ranks of pediatric specialists and other pediatric health care providers. \"Just over four years ago, we outlined a plan called Forward Together that would further enhance our ability to achieve the highest level of quality care and safety for all our patients, train the next generation of health care professionals and spark important new discoveries to improve health, \" said David S. Guzick, M.D., Ph.D., senior vice president for health affairs at UF and presi-dent, UF Health. \"I'm pleased to see our efforts to create a warm and welcoming environment come together in this dedicated space for our youngest patients. \" UF Health leaders held a ribbon-cutting ceremony Sept. 3 to celebrate the opening of the Sebastian Ferrero Atrium. Speakers included Guzick; Scott Rivkees, M.D., UF College of Medicine department of pediatrics chair and UF Health Shands Children's Hospital physician-in-chief; Ed Jimenez, UF Health Shands interim Quick facts The redesigned a trium features an interactive wall.

Said Mark Amox, UF Health Shands Chil- dren's Hospital administrator, \"We're excited that our patients and families will have, for the first time, a fully pediatric experience from the time they enter the hospital until they leave. Creating a better experience for our patients and families \u2014 clinically and environmentally \u2014 is very impor - tant to sustaining our high-quality programs and outcomes. \" The colorful floors sparkle and fixtures gleam, and the pediatric teams feel energized by the improvements. Amox said the increased focus on the facility and physical environment has created an enhanced sense of pride and vibrancy among faculty and staff. \"The environment of care has an incredible impact on morale and energy that helps us drive toward our goals of being the provider of choice, \" he said. \"The new lobby relates to the full spectrum of pediatric patients, \" said Susan Hahn, UF Health Shands Facilities Development project manager and account executive. \"It is designed to engage all patients through the use of interactive activities and help relieve their stress. \" While our pediatric patients, their families and visitors and our staff will benefit directly from a redesigned children's hospital, our community at large will also benefit.

News&Notes | sePteMBeR 2014 5 NEW&NEXTuf heal th shands children's hospital | Quality Baby-Friendly designation anticipated for children's hospital Improving the experience for mothers and newborns When Holly Danko, A.S.N, R.N., CCRN (C.S.O.), encountered a new mother who was receiving care in the UF Health Shands Hospital Cardiac ICU, she learned the patient had just given birth to a baby 10 weeks prematurely. It would have been easy to overlook some of the steps necessary to provide critical education and emotional support to this new parent given her own immediate health concerns. Instead, Danko proactively addressed the patient's breastfeeding goals \u2014 assisting her with pumping, hand expression and collection, and colostrum storage. With the support of her col-leagues, Danko was able to transport the new mother to the NICU for skin-to-skin therapy and bonding with her newborn. This is a shining example of the approach we need to take to become a designated \"Baby-Friendly\" hospital by Baby-Friendly USA, which recognizes hospitals that offer an optimal level of care for infant feeding and mother/baby bonding. Clinical teams at UF Health Shands Hospital are participating in Best Fed Beginnings, a first-of-its-kind, nationwide quality improvement initiative to help hospitals improve maternity care and obtain Baby-Friendly designation. \"It is important for nurses to be aware of how imperative it is for a mother to bond with her baby, \" Danko said. \" A program like this is needed to provide the necessary education for our moth-ers and families so that breastfeeding will continue after they leave the hospital. \" Upon a mother's request, nurses caring for newborns can now call for expressed breast milk even if the mother is in an ICU, and skin-to-skin practices are encouraged. After delivery, even after a C-section, infants are immediately placed on the mother's chest to encourage bonding, provided both the mother and baby are medically stable. Breastfeeding has shown to be one of the most effective preventive health measures for mothers and newborns. Hospitals participating in Best Fed Beginnings educate mothers on the importance of breastfeeding, provide excellent maternity care and achieve optimal infant feeding outcomes and mother/baby bonding. This initiative encourages mothers and babies to stay together and in the same room for baths, hearing tests and other practices that previously separated them. To reach the goals of this initiative, our clinic and hospital staff need to be informed and ready to educate expectant or new mothers. \"Getting this program initiated was chal- lenging, \" said Sandra Sullivan, M.D., a UF Col-lege of Medicine department of pediatrics clini-cal associate professor. \"Even with the support of executive hospital leadership, transforming culture is a journey. \" We anticipate a hospital site visit from Baby- Friendly USA later this fall. The two-day, com-prehensive assessment will measure how well we have integrated the 10 implementation steps listed in the sidebar (right). \" As a teaching hospital this is so important. It's not just about us, it's about our medical resi-dents and practitioners taking this out into other communities as well, \" said Kati Harlan, M.S.N., R.N., LHRM, UF Health Clinical Quality and Patient Safety senior quality improvement special-ist. \"We are impacting not only this generation, but generations to come. \" Visit babyfriendlyusa.org for more information. n&nQuick f acts The American Academy of Pediatrics-endorsed 10 Steps to Successful Breastfeeding (from Baby-Friendly USA): 1. Have a written breastfeeding policy that is routinely communicated to all health care staff. 2. Train all health care staff in the skills necessary to implement this policy. 3. Inform all pregnant women about the benefits and management of breastfeeding. 4. Help mothers initiate breastfeeding within one hour of birth. 5. Show mothers how to breastfeed and how to maintain lactation, even if they are separated from their infants. 6. Give infants no food or drink other than breast milk, unless medically indicated. 7. Practice rooming in \u2014 allow mothers and infants to remain together 24 hours a day. 8. Encourage breastfeeding on demand. 9. Give no pacifiers or artificial nipples to breastfeeding infants. 10. Foster the establishment of breastfeeding support groups and refer mothers to them on discharge from the hospital or birth center.

Last year, the flu season was unusually severe across the U.S. and internationally. Alachua County was no exception. At UF Health Shands Hospital, we admitted 387 patients with lab-con-firmed flu and 15 patients died from flu-related complications. We faced a public health crisis in which everyone \u2014 including younger people as well as vulnerable patient populations and hos-pital staff \u2014 was at increased risk for illness from the season's H1N1 virus. Health care workers infected with influenza have been the cause of outbreaks of the disease in hospitals, clinics and nursing homes. We have a responsibility to protect our patients, visitors and each other by making sure we are immunized against the flu. We need your participation and compliance. \"Providing outstanding care to patients is our top priority. The last thing we want to do is put them at risk, \" said Irene Alexaitis, D.N.P ., R.N., NEA-BC, UF Health Shands Hospital chief nursing officer and Nursing and Patient Care Services vice president. \" It's important for all of us to take this new policy seriously and get our flu vaccinations in a timely manner. \" Around the country, policies encouraging health care employees to get vaccinated have led to increased compliance. \"Many of our academic health center peers throughout the nation have introduced manda-tory flu vaccination for staff; and more than a dozen U.S. states have legislated mandatory flu vaccination for health care providers, \" said Timo-thy C. Flynn, M.D., UF College of Medicine senior associate dean for clinical affairs and UF Health Shands Hospital chief medical officer. \"Compared to unsuccessful voluntary flu vaccina-tion programs, most institutions with mandatory policies have achieved compliance rates exceeding 90 percent. \" GET VACCINATED BY NOV. 15 UF Health is introducing mandatory flu vaccination or a formal opt-out/mask process in areas of the organization where care is provided to patients. The mandatory flu vaccination or formal opt-out policy applies to the following individu-als who provide service in UF Health Shands, UF College of Medicine and UF Health Physi-cians, and UF College of Dentistry facilities and programs: UF Health Science Center college and institute physicians, residents and clinical pro-viders; UF Health Shands employees; UF Health health staff; students; trainees; and volunteers. These UF Health clinical care providers, individuals who interact with patients and anyone whose work brings them into patient care areas and into proximity to patients are expected to be vaccinated against the flu by Nov. 15. For employ-ees of UF Health Shands and UF Health Physi-cians, and UF College of Medicine physicians and allied health providers on our medical staffs, we encourage vaccination through UF Health Shands Occupational Health at no cost to staff. OPT OUT OF THE VACCINE \u2014 WEAR A MASK Those who choose to opt out of getting the vaccination for medical, religious or personal reasons will be required to follow a formal process by Nov. 15. These UF Health Shands-employed individuals must complete an online opt-out module on Healthstream to complete the declina-tion process. UF-employed providers and other credentialed medical staff and allied health staff providing care at UF Health Shands must com-plete and submit an opt-out form through the UF Health Shands Medical Staff Administration department. Starting Nov. 15 through March 31, indi- viduals above who decline vaccination will be required to wear a surgical mask whenever they are within 6 feet of a patient in any of the fol-lowing areas: admissions and registration areas; examination and procedure rooms; inpatient units; open care areas such as holding/waiting care units; patient wait-ing areas; outpatient practices; and off-site home care settings.

News&Notes | sePteMBeR 2014 9new&neX t uf heal th | service Lab Notes Check out some recent research developments happening at UF Health When it comes to staying healthy, it's a cell-eat-cell world. As cells age, damaged proteins and lipids accumulate within them. Impaired cell parts can send free radicals into the body, and dysfunctional proteins and lipids may break down DNA within cells, causing them to become toxic. Cells usually clean up their own damage through a \"housekeeping\" process called autophagy. But as the body ages and in people with certain diseases, cells' ability to do this housekeeping becomes less efficient. That means it may be harder for people to recover from car - diac events such as heart attack or other illnesses. Led by Debapriya Dutta, Ph.D., postdoctoral research associate and Christiaan Leeuwenburgh, Ph.D., UF College of Medicine division of biol-ogy and aging professor and chief, UF researchers have found that combining calorie restriction with a supplement of resveratrol, an antioxidant found in the skin of red grapes, dark chocolate and blueberries, could kick-start this housekeeping process, helping heart cells recover from damage, according to a study in rats published in the journal Free Radical Biology and Medicine. A daily low dose of aspirin can offer important protection against cardiovas-cular disease, but UF researchers say that the people who could receive the most benefit from the medication may not be taking it. Led by Arch G. Mainous III, Ph.D., UF College of Public Health and Health Professions department of health services research, management and policy chair, a UF study found that only 40 percent of people who were at high risk of cardiovascular disease said they received a doctor recommendation for aspirin therapy, while one-quarter of people at low risk reported their doc-tors told them to take the drug. The results appeared in the Journal of the American Heart Association. The famous slogan is \" A diamond is forever, \" but that phrase might be better suited to herpes. Unlike most viruses, which succumb to the immune system's attack, herpes remains in the body for - ever, lying in wait, sometimes reactivating years later. Researchers have long won-dered what causes herpes viruses \u2014 two strains of which are linked to cancer \u2014 to reactivate after remaining dormant once the initial infection resolves. Now a team of researchers, including two UF scien-tists, has discovered that interactions with other infections later in life can trigger these dormant viruses to resurface and cause disease. Understanding more about how specific pathogens interact with each other could help scientists devise new and better ways to combat these infec-tions and the diseases they cause, accord-ing to findings the researchers published in the journal Science. NEW&NEXT10 News&Notes | sePteMBeR 2014 new&neX t Outstanding patient care and hospitality go hand-in-hand, and nobody knows this bet-ter than Adrian Tyndall, M.D., M.P .H., UF College of Medicine emergency medicine chairman and UF Health Shands chief of emergency services. Before the UF Health Shands Emer - gency Center at Springhill opened in July 2013, Tyndall and his clinical leadership team spearheaded a mandatory full-day pre-opening retreat focused on hospitality. Every faculty member and employee who would staff the center was required to attend. Based on Patient First University, a hospitality initiative developed at UF Health Physicians, the retreat was a success and the center's team has received high praise from the community for customer service. \"I believe this full-day exercise had a dramatic impact on the entire team, \" Tyndall said. \" At the end of the day, we knew what we wanted to achieve, we were motivated and, ultimately, I believe we have been suc-cessful thus far. \" While Tyndall has seen Patient First University's successes first-hand, he believes the global nature of our new UF Health Hospitality and Service initiative and its pre-scribed Standards of Behavior is crucial. \"What we have not been able to effec- tively do so far is to adopt a culture where every fiber of our organization revolves around ensuring that the patient experience at our facilities is second to none, \" he said. \"It is a cultural change that also forces us to examine how we treat each other as employees in the work environment. \" Laura Gruber, M.B.A., M.H.S., UF Health Physicians senior director of admin-istration, strategy and education, helped create Patient First University. She agrees that delivering the new initiative to employ-ees throughout the academic health center is essential. \" An important element of the hospital- ity initiative is that it is being delivered to the entire system \u2014 physicians, non-physician clinical staff and individuals in administra-tive roles, \" Gruber said. \"It is also now rolled into new employee orientation activities. \" Gruber and Tyndall were both thrilled to be chosen as Hospitality and Service training facilitators and believe that the three-hour sessions will have a positive impact on faculty and staff. \"I'm absolutely delighted to participate as a facilitator; this is an area in which I have a great deal of passion, \" Gruber said. \"I think our employees, who have such varied perspectives and experiences, will enjoy the videos and stories we share during these sessions. \" n&nuf heal th | service Hospitality and Service initiative builds on proven principles Faculty and staff respond to training \" At the end of the day, we knew what we wanted to achieve, we were motivated and, ultimately, I believe we have been successful thus far. \" Adrian Tyndall, M.D., M.P .H., UF College of Medicine emergency medicine chairman and UF Health shands chief of emergency services .Adrian tyndall, M .d ., M .P .H ., UF College of Medicine emergency medicine chairman and UF Health shands chief of emergency services .

A certified peer visitor is an amputee who volun-teers to provide information and support for individuals preparing for an amputation or coping following surgery. The event was held at the city of Gainesville Alachua County Senior Recreation Cen-ter, which is operated through ElderCare of Alachua County. People who require an amputation are usually very upset and fearful about the procedure, according to Suzanne Questell, P .T., UF Health Shands Rehab Hospital Rehab Services director. \"What better time for a fellow amputee to come and visit, talk about life with limb loss and offer support and resources for a patient, \" she said. In 2013, Becky Piazza, M.S., OTR/L, UF Health Shands Rehab Hospital clinical coordinator, worked with local orthotic and prosthetic companies in the Gainesville area along with col-leagues at the rehab hospital to launch Gator Amps, a support group for amputees in our community. The group meets from 6 to 8 p.m. on the first Tuesday of every month at UF Health Shands Rehab Hospital. \"Hosting the certified peer visitor training with the Amputee Coalition of America is a big accomplishment for our group, \" Piazza said. \"These are the types of things we hope to achieve with our members and for the local amputee community. Getting amputees in touch with other amputees is a primary goal. \" The Gator Amps amputee support group has been meet- ing for more than a year with active participants from the amputee community. Not only is it an avenue to bring ampu-tees together but it also allows participants to mentor newer amputees and caregivers. \"Having an amputation changes your life but it doesn't mean life as you know it has to end, \" Piazza said. \"Our participants are learning that they can continue to live life to the fullest by exploring new ways to stay active and engaged in the things that are mean-ingful to them. \" For more information about the Gator Amps support group, email Piazza at piazzr@shands.ufl.edu. n&n At a recent support group meeting at our rehab hospital, Gator Amp participants tested adapted cycling options with Gator Cycle of Gainesville . Participants asked questions about adapted sports and leisure, shared their experiences and considered options that might work for their unique situations . Many participants had the opportunity to ride a bike for the very first time since their amputations, and several participants were able to ride the terratrike through the hospital . new&neX t News&Notes | sePteMBeR 2014 11\"Having an amputation changes your life but it doesn't mean life as you know it has to end. \" Becky Piazza, M.S., OTR/L, UF Health shands sePteMBeR 2014 NEW&NEXT uf heal th | service uf heal th-branded vehicles on the move Keep an eye out for UF Health's newly branded shuttle vehicles . there are currently two guest shuttles, two employee shuttles and one patient/ visitor parking van wrapped with the UF Health brand and messaging .

This spring, a new UF Health Shands core policy was introduced that addresses the use of UF Health Shands-issued hospital scrubs \u2014 the misty blue ones with a Shands label. The policy outlines who must wear them and limits where they should be worn. UF Health Shands Core Policy 06.015 explains the appropriate use of scrubs and a cost-effective system of providing them to staff. If you are authorized to wear these scrubs, you must change into them at the workplace. Scrub dispensing machines are located throughout our north and south campus hospitals. Hospital-provided scrubs may not be worn outside the hospital. Hospital scrubs can take a beating during the day-to-day activities of many employees. In the event of an incident involving blood and/or body fluid contamination to scrubs, hospital personnel can sign for and obtain scrubs from UF Health Shands linen personnel. Please read the entire policy to ensure compliance. You can find CP 06.015 on the ShandsConnect Portal under Special SHC Resources \u2014 click on Policies and Procedures.

The ceremony was held at Innovation Square Park, where Shands AGH once stood. \"It's an honor to pay tribute to AGH \u2014 not the building, but the thousands of people who, for decades, provided life-enhancing medical care and compassionate attention to residents of Alachua County and the surrounding communities, \" said Tim Goldfarb, UF Health executive vice president for regional and governmental affairs and former UF Health Shands CEO. The marker was installed on the site where the hospital stood for nearly 82 years, at the cor - ner of Southwest Fourth Avenue and Southwest Seventh Terrace. Generations of Alachua County families were treated at AGH, which gained a rep-utation for providing the area with high-quality, compassionate care. The state issues markers to designate sites that are significant local landmarks and are of his-torical and visual interest to visitors. They recog-nize notable places, persons or events in the areas of architecture, archaeology, history and culture. Among those who spoke at the event were Goldfarb; Ed Braddy, city of Gainesville mayor; Lee Pinkoson, Alachua County Board of County Commissioners chair; Melanie Barr, Alachua County Historical Commission chair; and Flor - ence Van Arnam, a local medical historian and former Shands AGH Auxiliary volunteer.
