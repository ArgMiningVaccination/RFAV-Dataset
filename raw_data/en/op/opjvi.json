Data as of Aug. 15, 2017. Notes: All data are based on approved petitions during the fiscal year. Per USCIS best practices, units of less than 10 are aggregated so as to limit the possibility of the de-anonymization of data. \"D\" represents data withheld to protect privacy. \"Employer Industry\" is based on the employer NAICS code, not job code. Some employer industry information is missing from our data system and thus left blank. Employers without tax identification numbers in our system were excluded. While some company names may appear multiple times, USCIS enters data as listed on the petition and does not combine companies, even where the names are the same, because in all cases the employer tax identification numbers are different on the petition. The L-1A nonimmigrant classification refers to intracompany transfers of corporate managers and executives. The L-1B nonimmigrant classification refers to intracompany transfers of employees who possess \"specialized knowledge.\" The LZ classification refers to \"blanket\" L petitions and may be used by entities involved in commercial trade or services. While the term \"L-1\" is used for visa issuance and admission purposes, USCIS uses the \"A\" and \"B\" distinctions internally for statistical and other purposes.
