This often happens when we are out of alignment with our authentic selves or when we've been disconnected from spiritual energy sources, especially over prolonged periods of time. If you want to revitalize your spiritual side and start living a life you love, try these daily practices to help you. Begin Each Day with Stretching + Meditation There are dozens of studies out there that show just how much your morning habits affect how you feel throughout the rest of the day. By stretching and [meditating](https://lunavoxhealing.com/5-benefits-of-daily-meditations/) soon after you wake up, you essentially open up your body and mind to positive energies in the Universe. When you stretch properly, you spend time breathing into each movement, allowing oxygen and energy to move through your body's muscles. And just as breath boosts your energy physically, this same oxygen also helps to wake up the brain. While you meditate, practicing breathing exercises can provide calmness, clarity, and creativity to the mind and spirit. Read Life-Changing Books Sometimes there's nothing quite like an inspiring book to refuel your spiritual energy in ways you may not even realize were possible. Our list of [books for complete mind-body-spirit transformation](https://lunavoxhealing.com/5-books-for-mind-body-spirit-transformation/) can be a great place to start. Each one is unique, but they are all total game-changers when it comes to shifting your energetic practice and seeing your life in a new light. Reconnect with the Space Around You Whether you realize it or not, the environment we live in and are surrounded by daily significantly affects our perspectives, beliefs, and overall well-being. If you've been in an emotional and spiritual \"rut\", it might be time to look at the physical spaces around you. Do the rooms you spend the most time in provide a space where you can feel uplifted or at peace? Is your home a relaxing, free-of-clutter place to be, or is it time for a deep cleanse of your shelves and closets? And \u2014 quite possibly the toughest question of them all \u2014 is the city or state you live in clashing with your spiritual self? Maybe you need something as simple as a new coat of paint on the walls or a day of organizing messy spaces in your home. Maybe you need a fresh start in a new place. Whatever that looks like for you, adjusting your physical surroundings can bring the internal change you're seeking. Spend Time in Nature Organizing and creating an indoor space that makes you feel relaxed or inspired is important, but so is taking a walk outside. Spending time in the natural environment has plenty of benefits on our health subconsciously, but it can also help us feel more connected with ourselves and others around us. Even [being outside for as little as two hours per week](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/brain-waves/201906/how-much-time-in-nature-is-needed-see-benefits), or about 15-20 minutes per day, can boost your energy levels, lower stress, and strengthen your spiritual connection. Practice Giving to Others You may find that the source to refuel your spiritual energy is in living a compassionate life. Oftentimes we forget that giving to others doesn't only come in the form of traditional gifts, but also in many other simple or unexpected ways. Call a family member who's going through a tough time. Surprise a friend with something you made by hand. Do something nice for a complete stranger. When we give to others wholeheartedly without expecting anything in return, we raise our frequency and discover a never-ending source of energy. Release Energy Blocks There are several main centers of energy (also known as chakras) located within our bodies, each one connected to one another, and bridging our physical selves with our spiritual selves. When we experience things like fear, stress, anxiety, and unhappiness, these energy hot spots can become blocked and potentially lead to a variety of other physical and spiritual challenges. In our chiropractic and reiki healing sessions at LunaVox, we pay close attention to chakras so that we can notice any areas where the energy feels stagnant, \"stuck\" or blocked and better help our patients heal.
