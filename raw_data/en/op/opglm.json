We thank Clare Whittaker, Christopher Moore, John Rathmann, and Giune Padilla for assay setup. The Panel of Human Antiserum and Immune Globulin to Respiratory Syncytial Virus NR-32832 reagent was obtained through BEI Resources, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH). We also thank our colleagues at the US NIH Clinical Center and NIAID for their contributions, including the NIAID Institutional Review Board, the Emmes Corporation, and colleagues at the NIAID Vaccine Research Centre, including the Vaccine Clinical Materials Program and VRC Pilot Plant. This work was supported with intramural funding from the NIAID. Funding Information: VRC 317 was a phase 1, open-label, randomised, domestic single-site clinical trial to evaluate dose, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of an investigational stabilised prefusion RSV F subunit protein vaccine, DS-Cav1, alone or with AlOH adjuvant. Eligible participants were healthy adults aged 18-50 years with body-mass index of 40 or less. Participants were recruited from the Washington, DC, metropolitan area by institutional review board-approved advertisements. Top recruitment sources include word of mouth and distribution of advertisements in person at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and online at ResearchMatch.org . The trial was sponsored by the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at the NIH in Bethesda, MD, USA and done at the NIH Clinical Center. The study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board at NIAID. The protocol was subsequently amended to give participants the option to forgo the second immunisation with DS-Cav1 and complete the scheduled study visits to further assess immunogenicity of a single vaccine dose. The Department of Health and Human Services Guidelines for the protection of human research participants were followed and institutional review board approval was obtained. All participants provided written informed consent before enrolment. VRC investigators developed the vaccine, and the VRC Clinical Trials Program ran the study. Publisher Copyright: \u00a9 Elsevier N2 - Background: Multiple active vaccination approaches have proven ineffective in reducing the substantial morbidity and mortality caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants and older adults (aged 65 years). A vaccine conferring a substantial and sustainable boost in neutralising activity is required to protect against severe RSV disease. To that end, we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of DS-Cav1, a prefusion F subunit vaccine. Methods: In randomised, open-label, phase 1 clinical trial, the stabilised prefusion F vaccine DS-Cav1 was evaluated for dose, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity in healthy adults aged 18-50 years at a single US site. Participants were assigned to receive escalating doses of either 50 g, 150 g, or 500 g DS-Cav1 at weeks 0 and 12, and were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio within each dose group to receive the vaccine with or without aluminium hydroxide (AlOH) adjuvant. After 71 participants had been randomised, the protocol was amended to allow some participants to receive a single vaccination at week 0. The primary objectives evaluated the safety and tolerability at every dose within 28 days following each injection. Neutralising activity and RSV F-binding antibodies were evaluated from week 0 to week 44 as secondary and exploratory objectives. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one vaccine dose; secondary and exploratory immunogenicity analysis included all participants with available data at a given visit. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03049488, and is complete and no longer recruiting. Findings: Between Feb 21, 2017, and Nov 29, 2018, 244 participants were screened for eligibility and 95 were enrolled to receive DS-Cav1 at the 50 g (n=30, of which n=15 with AlOH), 150 g (n=35, of which n=15 with AlOH), or 500 g (n=30, of which n=15 with AlOH) doses. DS-Cav1 was safe and well tolerated and no serious vaccine-associated adverse events deemed related to the vaccine were identified. DS-Cav1 vaccination elicited robust neutralising activity and binding antibodies by 4 weeks after a single vaccination (p<0\u00b70001 for F-binding and neutralising antibodies). In analyses of exploratory endpoints at week 44, pre-F-binding IgG and neutralising activity were significantly increased compared with baseline in all groups. At week 44, RSV A neutralising activity was 3\u00b71 fold above baseline in the 50 g group, 3\u00b78 fold in the 150 g group, and 4\u00b75 fold in the 500 g group (p<0\u00b70001). RSV B neutralising activity was 2\u00b78 fold above baseline in the 50 g group, 3\u00b74 fold in the 150 g group, and 3\u00b77 fold in the 500 g group (p<0\u00b70001). Pre-F-binding IgG remained significantly 3\u00b72 fold above baseline in the 50 g group, 3\u00b74 fold in the 150 g group, and 4\u00b70 fold in the 500 g group (p<0\u00b70001). Pre-F-binding serum IgA remained 4\u00b71 fold above baseline in the 50 g group, 4\u00b73 fold in the 150 g group, and 4\u00b78 fold in the 500 g group (p<0\u00b70001). Although a higher vaccine dose or second immunisation elicited a transient advantage compared with lower doses or a single immunisation, neither significantly impacted long-term neutralisation. There was no long-term effect of dose, number of vaccinations, or adjuvant on neutralising activity. Interpretation: In this phase 1 study, DS-Cav1 vaccination was safe and well tolerated. DS-Cav1 vaccination elicited a robust boost in RSV F-specific antibodies and neutralising activity that was sustained above baseline for at least 44 weeks. A single low-dose of pre-F immunisation of antigen-experienced individuals might confer protection that extends throughout an entire RSV season.
