This would cover additional priority populationsAll participants receive doses to cover 3% of their population. This would be enough to cover all workers involved in health and social care work.All participants receive additional doses beyond the 3% to total 20% of their population (in tranches). This could include the elderly , adults with comorbidities or others depending on locally relevant risk factorsHealth and social care workersHigh -risk adults TIMINGParticipants receive doses proportionally to their total population*Two main flexibilities: 1.Countries can receive doses for next tranche if there is availability which other countries can't absorb 2.Quantity per allocation round can be increased for smaller states to help cost effectivenessBetween country prioritization based on: Threat of COVID (assessed using R 0 and co-circulation of influenza viruses) Vulnerability (assessed using health system capacity and hospital bed occupancy) Exceptional factors (e.g., natural disaster or sudden major outbreaks)Protect public health and minimize societal and economic impact by reducing COVID -19 mortality High risk adultsFurther priority groups If protracted severe supply constraints remain, timing is based on participants ' vulnerability & COVID -19 threatWHO has proposed an allocation framework to manage this phased approach Note: * The fundamental principle applies that all participants receive doses at the same rate to the extent possible, notwithst anding likely practical limitations to be further worked out (e.g., minimum delivery volumes)20 MENA countries have advantage of young population but some of the world 's highest obesity and diabetes prevalence rates All MENA countries except Djibouti and Yemen have obesity rates > 25% MENA is the region most affected by type 2 diabetes (12.2 % prevalence rate in 2019 )Country NameNurses and Physicians (%)Population ages 65 and above (%)Obesity rate (%)Diabetes prevalence rate (%) Algeria 0.33 7 27 6.7 Bahrain 0.34 3 30 15.6 Djibouti 0.10 5 14 5.1 Egypt 0.24 5 32 17.2 Iran 0.42 6 26 9.6 Iraq 0.28 3 30 8.8 Jordan 0.51 4 36 12.7 Kuwait 1.01 3 38 12.2 Lebanon 0.38 7 38 11.2 Libya 0.86 4 33 10.2 Morocco 0.21 7 26 7 Oman 0.62 2 27 10.1 Qatar 0.97 2 35 15.6 Saudi Arabia 0.81 3 35 15.8 Tunisia 0.38 9 27 8.5 UAE 0.83 1 32 16.3 WB & Gaza 0.25 3 NA 9.5 Yemen 0.13 3 17 5.4 World average Egypt * Morocco * WB & GazaIran Libya * Bahrain Tunisia * Lebanon Qatar UAE Djibouti * Oman Saudi ArabiaJordan Iraq YemenAt least 20% of MENA countries have officially already secured enough doses to achieve 70% coverage Note: Supply deals estimate include 20% of population coverag through COVAX , (*) c.15% of population covered by African Union doses (Algeria, Djibouti, Libya, Morocco, Syria and Tunisia), publicly available information on additional bilateral deals with vaccine manufacturers Source: Airfinity; Press reportsProportion of population covered by existing supply deals 20-30% coverage30-70% coverage70% + coverage22Vaccine and delivery costsAMC 92 countries Will receive first 16-20% free from COVAX Should expect doses to cover 20% of their populations in 2021 May cost-share additional doses at $ 7/dose Eligible African Union Countries will be able to access additional Pfizer, AZ and J&J to cover up to 15% more of their population Most countries will have to purchase and manage the implementation of more than one type of vaccine Purchase costs ranging from $2.5 a dose to > $ 20 per dose Variable implementation costs depending on ultra cold chain requirements (mRNA vaccines) or single dose (J&J) versus 2 doses vaccines (all other current frontrunner vaccines) Note: Current assessment of vaccine costs based on averages communicated by COVAX and manufacturers, and global service delivery estimates23 Estimated cost to vaccinate one person in MENA countries / $21.10$19.42 $26.10$17.46 / $24.92Anticipated average cost per doseTwo doses needed for most vaccinesTransportation cost currently included in dose priceService delivery in country $ 2.76 per person; 5% wastageSupply chain in country $1.18 perpersonClimate sensitive cold chain investment $0.56 avg. / person1 Cost estimates for climate friendly cold chain are estimated by WBG and ESMAP , and are on a global basisCost estimates for supply chain and service delivery are based data from routine childhood immunization.

Vaccine VaccineExpanding revenues (including via health taxes), borrowing, external assistance (including and additional to COVAX), etc. Reprioritization, efficiency gains, cutting pro -rich subsidies, debt restructuring, delaying capital expenditures, etc.41 Key Messages COVID -19 is not just a health \"shock\" , it is also adversely impacting economies across the region as well as globally. COVID -19vaccine is not just a health intervention, it is also an \"economic stimulus\" intervention: huge cost -benefit ratios. Given \"externalities \", financing for COVID -19 vaccines should come primarily from government sources to ensure widespread coverage, facilitating attainment of \"herd\" immunity. Given challenges of public financing for health across MNA region -both pre -crisis as well as due to COVID -19's adverse economic impact --financing for COVID -19 vaccines should not come at the expense of allocations for routine health services (or even productive spending in other sectors). Countries could consider menu of options for financing COVID -19 vaccines: external financing, raising new revenues, additional borrowing, debt restructuring, reprioritization, as well as efficiency gains.42Part 4: Country highlight | Vaccine financing approach by Iraq and Egypt 43 43Omar AbdulAmeer Director of Financial Planning, Ministry of Health of Iraq 44Iraq's Experience in financing National COVID -19 vaccination plan 45 Iraq's Experience in financing National COVID -19 vaccination plan Pandemic Situation, Iraq till Jan 27, 2021 5,010,139 Total tested 615,380 Total confirmed cases 584,752 Total cured 13,010 Total deaths 95,0% Cure rate 2.13% Case fatality rate 29,033 Total infected health workers 181 Total deaths among health workers 46 The impact of COVID -19 on the health budget The negative economic impact of the pandemic on Iraq's economy had multiple folds. Drop of oil price reduced the main government fund source by 35 -45% during 2020 in comparison to 2019. The lockdown and its direct and indirect economic effects resulted in further drop of government local fund amounts compared to 2019. Iraqi MOH had to provide health services related to combating the pandemic using less funds than that was spent during 2019 i.e. before the pandemic. Failure to pass national fiscal budget law and/or emergency budget law subjected MOH budget to further strain. MOH had to come up with innovative solutions for securing necessary funds for the national vaccination plan focusing on involving key partners and decision takers from the Iraqi government, including the council of ministers, in the vaccination plan development and its financing options decisions. Similar process is followed with the international partners as well. 47 The required budget for the National COVID -19 vaccination plan was calculated basing on the total cost of the planned activities that ensures the achievement of its main short and medium term objectives. Iraq intends to vaccinate 60% of Iraqi population within 1 -2 years to reach the herd immunity threshold. The National COVID -19 vaccination plan takes in consideration scientific factors related to the virus and its transmission methods, the potential vaccines under development and their transportation, storage and distribution requirements. It also considers local factors such as the total number of infected patients, defining risk groups, training requirements and cost to increase knowledge and skills of MOH staff in handling and distributing the vaccine, existing vaccine cold chain and its compatibility with the requirements of the potential COVID -19 vaccine, number of existing health facilities that can be used as delivery points and the cost to upgrade them to attain to their intended functions within the plan. The National plan takes in account the total cost and fund transfer schedule to fulfill Iraq's commitment with COVAX facility agreement (signed during 20).The process to assess financial needs for vaccination 48 The estimated cost for the national COVID -19 vaccination plan is: 358 million USD to cover 40% of the population ( 1stphase of the plan). There was growth in health expenditure related to covering recurrent costs for combating the pandemic (HRH safety PPE, disinfection requirements and materials, specific medicines, ext). investment costs to expand health services related to detecting the disease (increasing specialized labs from 1 central public health lab and 3 in KRG to 70 labs for COVID -19 diagnosis in all provinces including more than 15 lab for testing the travelers): increasing PCR machines from ( 7) to ( 216). Increasing hospital bed capacity for treating COVID -19 by adding more than ( 12,000 ) (increasing total hospital beds from 45,000 to 57,000 ). That added operational cost for running these new hospitals. The total number of newly opened hospitals is ( 60).The estimated cost for COVID -19 vaccination and the growing spending needs in the health sector beyond vaccination 49 Source of the money for vaccines Iraqi government and MOH are committed to provide the required fund for National vaccination plan by: Reallocating fund within MOH essential medicine procurement budget to cover part of the cost. Restructuring existing loans for other ministries to the vaccine plan ( 100 million USD loan from the WB). Donations from national (banks, businesses, phillantrofers and individuals) and international partners (Governments, UN, International NGOs). Negotiating new national and International loans (example: 500 million USD from IMF to the Iraqi government devoted specifically to procuring COVId -19 vaccine -pending approval by the Iraqi parliament). Attracting more international donors through the establishment of transparent fund management and vaccine procurement mechanism in accordance to the international standards (Joint steering committee, delegating procurement to WHO) 50 Iraq's successes and recommendations for others Successes The biggest success MOH made in securing funds to the National vaccination plan is gaining the support of the council of ministers including skeptical decision takers whom advocated that the pandemic will subside due to extreme Iraqi summer. Recommendations to others on the cost assessment and financing journey Estimated budget MUST be based on clear and well designed planning process that can produce realistic response plan (in this case vaccination plan). Active communication with decision takers within MOH and Iraqi government. Ensure provision of accurate information related to the progress of negotiation to MOH leadership. 51 Justifying the high cost of procuring COVID -19 vaccine despite shortage of long term evidence on its safety and effectiveness. Iraqi laws and regulations related to procurement of the vaccine aren 't compatible with the proposed mechanism of COVAX facility agreement. Iraqi parliament failed to pass (Emergency Budget) to cover the urgent costs of the pandemic (including the 1stbatch of the vaccine) during 2020 .Challenges thus far in this process 52Thank you 53 53Mai Farid Assistant Minister of Finance, Ministry of Finance, Egypt 54Text Text Closing remarks 55Thank you for joining the second workshop in our World Bank MENA COVID -19 Vaccine Strategy Workshop Series The next workshop will take place on Tuesday 2/2 at the same time.
