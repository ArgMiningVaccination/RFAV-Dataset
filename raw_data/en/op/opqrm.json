The idea of mikveh resonated with me - entering the waters helped me release the pain I (sometimes) still feel and it helped me accept and better integrate how cancer is still a part of me and is something I can live with.\" Karen Immersion may be used to mark the changes and challenges inflicted by illness and loss. Immersion is also a way to embrace the future with gratitude. The emotional and spiritual toll that follows many kinds of losses and struggles is not always acknowledged. Many people find that mikveh provides a way to face up to the changes wrought by pain, illness, and loss. While there is no \"cure\" in the waters of the mikveh, many people do find a sense of healing and wholeness there. Some of the reasons for a healing immersion include: - After a diagnosis of cancer, as a way to prepare for treatment or surgery - After cancer treatment is completed and the \"patient\" becomes a \"survivor\" - After divorce - After a period of mourning - After miscarriage, stillbirth, abortion - Upon deciding to end fertility treatments Mayyim Hayyim has a range of [ceremonies](https://www.mayyimhayyim.org/resources/ceremonies/) to help individuals name the fear, despair, faith, gratitude, and hope that are often part of the healing process. Mayyim Hayyim has also published a book called [Blessings for the Journey: A Jewish Healing Guide for Women with Cancer](https://www.mayyimhayyim.org/product/blessings-for-the-journey/). Written by a group of thirteen volunteers \u2014 cancer survivors, caregivers and health care professionals \u2014 who identified the need for a guide to the journey through treatment and its aftermath, they created an invaluable resource based on Jewish teachings and first-hand experience.
