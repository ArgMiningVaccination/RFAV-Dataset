Page xixiiiPrologue At the beginning of the 21st century, our Region's health report card is mixed. On the plus side, the countries of the Americas have made clear gains in\"Health for All\" goals. Infant mortality rates are lower, for example, and this,in turn, has helped to add six years to life expectancy at birth in the last twodecades. On the other hand, these gains have not been evenly attainedthroughout the Region, and some countries, as well as some areas and popu-lation groups within countries, have been deprived of these benefits. The fastpace of aging and urbanization has resulted in an exponential rise in chronicnoncommunicable diseases, adding to the yet unsolved toll in death and dis-ability wrought by communicable diseases, especially among the poor. Already, noncommunicable diseases are the leading cause of disability and pre- mature mortality in the vast majority of countries of the Americas. If projectionshold, chronic degenerative diseases, lifestyle-related diseases, and violence willcontinue to take up an increasingly greater share of death and suffering, im-pairing the quality of life among the peoples of the Americas. They will alsoovertax health services and drive up health care costs. The good news is thatmany of these diseases and conditions can be prevented. At the very least, theirdevelopment can be delayed or slowed, their severity mitigated. Because manyof their determinants and risk factors respond to behavior change, health pro-motion holds the key in this battle. Throughout its 100 years of work in and for health with the countries of the Americas, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has championed theprevention of disease and the enhancement of health. Following the \"OttawaCharter for Health Promotion\" issued by the First International Conference onHealth Promotion in 1986, PAHO's health promotion efforts focused and gath-ered momentum. Since then, the Organization has worked with its MemberStates to fulfill the Charter's health promotion tenets, pursuing efforts that haveincluded the fostering of healthy public policies, creation of supportive environ-ments, strengthening of community actions, and development of personal skills.The book that you hold in your hands is PAHO's latest contribution to its overallhealth promotion effort. The Handbook blends proven disease prevention practices and behavioral sci- ence principles into a one-of-a-kind, hands-on manual. Its pages spell out how PROLOGUE51331_p001_018_r1 4/7/03 1:40 PM Page xiiito think about developing effective health promotion/disease prevention pro- grams and how to carry them out so that they yield the best possible results.The book explores the causes of morbidity, disability, and premature mortalityfor each stage in the life cycle\u2014from infancy to the elder years. The Handbookalso looks at the protective and risk factors for each of the leading forms ofdeath and disability, and recommends easily implemented, practical preventiveinterventions. Health professionals battling to \"add years to life and life to years\" will find Building Better Health: A Handbook of Behavioral Change an invaluable tool in their work. In addition, national, provincial, and local health authorities will findit useful in planning health promotion programs. We hope that it also will be-come a popular textbook for teaching and training new generations of healthworkers. We are grateful to the author, Dr. C. David Jenkins, a well-known professor of psychiatry, epidemiology, and preventive medicine and community health forpartnering with PAHO to issue this important and useful work. Dr. Mirta Roses Periago Director xiv BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p001_018_r1 4/7/03 1:40 Page Dear Reader: Welcome to Building Better Health: A Handbook of Behavioral Change . Today, the nations of the world devote huge sums of money to \"health care.\" Sadly, about 98% of these budgets are actually spent on \"disease care\" andonly about 1% or 2% on genuine care of health. In contrast, this Handbookdevotes itself fully to health care, defined as improving and maintaining goodhealth\u2014which consists of feeling well and functioning well, physically, men-tally and interpersonally; as well as having a high likelihood of continuing tolive healthfully in the future. The highway to \"Health for All\" for the 21st Century will be constructed by ac- tivating within communities already proven methods for advancing health andpreventing disease and disability. The science is known, now its utilization mustspread. Most of the programs we present are low technology, but people-intensive. Hence, they are sustainable even where financial resources are limited. This book has been written by many people: those who have asked \"What if?\" and \"Why not?\"; those whose words and data I have read; and especiallythose in many parts of the world, in high and low places, to whom I have lis-tened carefully over the years. Actually, these thoughtful people are much likeyou who read this Handbook. And I sincerely thank them. My task has beenlike that of a chef\u2014to take these rich ingredients and blend them in a way thatis appealing, nourishing, and energizing. This Handbook was written for many kinds of persons, in many different coun- tries, professions, and community niches. You may be a health worker in thecountryside, a physician in a health clinic, a visiting nurse, a student in thehealth professions, someone updating their knowledge of community prob-lems, a school teacher, a town council member, a dedicated parent, or some-one else beyond my imagination. In any case, if you read this book, you are astudent and a seeker. I am both of those, so we should get along well. The Handbook covers many topics. I'm not an expert in most of them, but I've compared multiple resources and tried to select the better-validated and more xv PREFACE51331_p001_018_r1 4/7/03 1:40 PM Page xvpractical wheat from acres and hectares of chaff. Expert reviewers have checked over each chapter, and I express my appreciation to all of them here.I am responsible for whatever errors may remain. You will find that reading theHandbook is different from reading a medical or public health textbook. I'vetried to keep it fresh, personal, concrete, motivating, and sometimes even prod-ding. Comprehensive indexing makes the Handbook easier to use. So, please\u2014enjoy! Compare your ideas with those presented here, find new directions, see what actions can address the needs of the people around you.Be captured by a sense of urgency and an assurance that you can start thisjourney to a healthier world.

LAYING THE FOUNDATION51331_p019_028_r1 4/7/03 3:10 PM Page 11. General Principles of Health Promotion and DiseasePrevention The scientific engines of the 20th century powered a revolution in biomedical sciences. These advances delivered deeper understanding of the dynamics of bi-ological processes, amazing new pharmaceuticals, and space-age techniques forvisualizing and treating problems deep inside the body. They have remediedmany kinds of diseases and injuries for millions of people\u2014but they have leftthe remaining billions with most of the same scourges their grandparents suf-fered 100 years ago. The 21st century cries out for a new dimension of revolution, one that is not expressed mainly in organic chemistry, or in subcellular messengers, or in ge-nomics. Rather, it will be expressed in the expectations, overriding goals,actions, and commitments of individuals, families, communities, and nations.No group of people, no matter how privileged and protected, can feel smuglysafe and immune from the biopsychosocial epidemics of suffering that roamunchecked through the majority of the neighborhoods in this global village. The new health revolution must carry the most potent advances in our scien- tific framework of knowledge to the people and places where they can make thedifference between life and death. Only then can the possibility of \"health forall\" see its sunrise. HUMAN AND ECONOMIC VALUES OF PREVENTION Health is the first and most important form of wealth. Health\u2014the physical,mental, and social health of an entire population\u2014is a nation's fundamental natural resource. If it is ignored or wasted, farms will wither, mines will close,factory engines will slow their production, families will break up, and children'slaughter will no longer sing throughout the community. If health becomes onlythe province of the wealthy, that nation has an ominous future. The poor willstruggle for equity, and even the wealthy, feeling isolated or disabled or in fear,will stop enjoying their riches. Health is the essential foundation that supports and nurtures growth, learning, personal well being, social fulfillment, enrichment of others, economic produc-tion, and constructive citizenship. Cost-benefit research has become a popular 3 GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF HEALTH PROMOTION AND DISEASE PREVENTION51331_p019_028_r1 4/7/03 3:10 PM Page 3means to evaluate both medical treatment and preventive medicine, with the units of measure- ment usually being drawn from the monetarysystem. We should keep in mind, however, thatsuccessfully promoting good health has intrinsicvalues and enabling powers that reach far be-yond a single year's budget. With the world's national economies in transition from producing natural re- sources to adding value to resources through manufacturing, and now to the riseof the service economy and information management, the allocations for devel-oping national infrastructures will increasingly shift to investing in the humaninfrastructure. Only by improving the health and learning opportunities of thenext generation can the most valuable infrastructure for a nation's future besolidly built. Since the 1950s, health care costs have skyrocketed in most nations. Advances in medical technology have made it possible to treat more and more illnessesand disabilities with increasingly sophisticated equipment, for both diagnosticand therapeutic purposes. Further, the miracles of medicine and surgery cannow keep more patients with severe illnesses and injuries alive longer, often intoolder ages, at much greater cost to the community. As more of these patientssurvive, more and more persons need to be trained to provide rehabilitation andlong-term care for this increasing percentage of the population. Thus, the pro-portion of the gross national product going into tertiary health care services issteadily increasing in most countries. Successful health promotion and protection programs can be made available cost-effectively to the entire population. They have the potential to halt this ex-pansion of preventable costs, or at least to slow its progress. Health-promotingprenatal care, for example, can deliver healthier babies, and preventive medicinein infancy and childhood will produce healthier children who can grow to theirfull potential and learn a full array of cognitive and motor skills. Effective pro-grams to protect children and youth from injury and violence also will generatea healthier work force and lower the frequency of disabled persons needing healthcare. Introducing healthy lifestyle habits early in childhood, and reinforcing themthrough young adulthood, will prevent much of the current morbidity and mor-tality rates due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and cancers, which at-tack adults in their prime middle years. Clearly, keeping adults economically pro-ductive up to their retirement should be a goal both for health promotion andfor economic development. Finally, as the elderly population in every nationgrows, it becomes increasingly important to maximize the health and self-careabilities of retired citizens for as long as possible in their remaining years. 4 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHHealth is the essential foundation that supports and nurtures growth, learning, personal well being, social fulfillment, enrichment of others, economic production, and constructive citizenship.51331_p019_028_r1 4/7/03 3:10 PM Page 4To reach all of these goals, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. This book will present, \"ounce by ounce,\" specific preventive interventions thatare beneficial, practical, inexpensive, and sustainable. They are currently themost visible signposts on the highway toimprove health for all in the twenty-firstcentury. We know that it is always better to prevent a disease or an external trauma than to treatit after it happens\u2014prevention saves indi-viduals, andtheir families, from pain, suf- fering, loss of function, prolonged disabil-ity, or premature death. Some prevention programs also save money, dependingon the program, the population, the disease, and whether one is consideringshort-term or long-term community outcomes. For families and for nations,this is a most welcome message in these times of escalating costs of medical care,especially high technology care. The only time when prevention could be moreexpensive than treatment is when disease or injury is infrequent and movesquickly to death before major expenses are incurred\u2014and this is even morepainful for surviving family and friends. But the argument for prevention cannot\u2014and should not\u2014be made primarily on economic grounds. Even though mortality from ischemic (coronary) heartdisease has declined sharply since about 1970 (a 30% to 50% decline in someWesternized countries), the cost of treating each case has actually gone up be-cause new technology has created new diagnostic tests and new therapeutic pro-cedures. In addition, the fact that there is an ever-growing number of cardiolo-gists, makes the overall economic benefit negligible. And yet, we would not want to roll-back scientific advance or the achievement of a full complement of medical specialists. The justification for prevention isthat it reduces suffering, makes disability and its diminishments less common,and keeps death off the family's doorstep until much later. As the wise professorGeoffrey Rose put it: \"It is better to be healthy than ill or dead. That is the be-ginning and the end of the only real argument for preventive medicine. It is suf-ficient\" (Rose, 1992). Policymakers and the public alike also should consider that some diseases and disabilities, although preventable, are just not curable by any means\u2014in the20th century one immediately thinks of AIDS. Such issues as the damagecaused by a cerebrovascular accident, an automobile crash that cripples a child,or the liver damage caused by excessive use of alcohol also must be weighed. Pol-icymakers dealing in health issues and health professionals must recognize thatprevention is the only \"cure\" available for such destructive maladies. 5 GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF HEALTH PROMOTION AND DISEASE PREVENTIONKeeping adults economically productive up to their retirementshould be a goal both for healthpromotion and for economicdevelopment.51331_p019_028_r1 4/7/03 3:10 PM Page 5DISEASE PREVENTION AND HEALTH PROMOTION Promoting healthy lifestyles involves action on two fronts: disease prevention and health promotion. While there is much overlap between these efforts, dis-ease prevention usually focuses more on specific kinds of illness and trauma andoften relies more on the direct involvement of health professionals. There are afew biologically focused physicians who still claim that disease prevention pro-grams cannot really succeed \"because you cannot change people.\" This is obvi-ously false: tens of millions of people change their health habits and otherlifestyle aspects every year. The clear feasibility and success of prevention effortshave been demonstrated for many health problems in many nations. Considerthe nearly 50% dramatic decline in cardiovascular mortality in North Americaand Western Europe since 1970. In contrast, health promotion involves both individual and family behaviors\u2014 as well as healthy public policies in the community\u2014that protect a personagainst numerous health threats and elicit a general sense of personal responsi-bility for maximizing one's safety, host resistance, vitality, and effective function-ing. Health promotion, while often using guidance and motivation from healthprofessionals, depends more heavily on individuals acting to change health be-haviors in themselves, their families, and their community, as well as advocatingpreventive health priorities among policymakers, business, industry, and govern-ment. This Handbook lays out critical health problems and the social and be-havioral changes needed to resolve them\u2014both by means of health promotionand disease prevention. THREE LEVELS OF PREVENTION Epidemiologists have identified three stages of the disease process at whichpreventive actions can be effective\u2014primary prevention, secondary prevention,and tertiary prevention. PRIMARY PREVENTION Primary prevention aims at keeping a disease from ever beginning or a traumafrom ever occurring. Examples include immunization, reducing household haz-ards, motivating abstinence from illegal drugs, and reducing risk factors forheart disease. Primary prevention programs aim to reach the widest possiblepopulation group who is or might become at risk for a given health problem. Health promotion programs are usually at the primary prevention level. Quite often a single behavioral habit will protect against a host of diseases. For ex-ample, helping children and youth never to start using tobacco (and adults to 6 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p019_028_r1 4/7/03 3:10 PM Page 6stop smoking) yields a 90% reduction in the risk of lung cancer, a 30% to 40% reduction (depending on the population) in the risk of heart attack, a 90% re-duction in the risk of chronic lung disease, reductions in many sites of cancer,a reduction in auto accidents and injuries due to fire, and a reduction in therates of acute respiratory diseases in young children in the home (Last, 1987). Avoiding or limiting use of alcohol is another lifestyle choice that promotes health in many ways. Last (1987) lists 76 different biological, psychiatric, andbehavioral problems caused or worsened by excessive alcohol use. These range all the way from acute intoxication to de-pression; suicide; cancers of the head, anemia; andmany types of complications of pregnancyand birth defects. Increasing regular, moderate physical exer- cise and maintaining proper appropriateeating patterns are other health promotinghabits that also have a wide range of benefits, including preventing atheroscle-rosis, reducing high blood pressure, lowering LDL cholesterol, reducing the riskof adult onset diabetes, and strengthening the cardiorespiratory and musculo-skeletal systems. SECONDARY PREVENTION Secondary prevention involves the early detection and early intervention againstdisease before it develops fully. Screening programs are prime examples of sec-ondary prevention efforts, providing that persons who screen positive for a dis-ease or condition receive prompt and effective intervention. Conducting screen-ing without full follow-up wastes money and creates anxiety and frustration inthe community. Some cancer screening seeks to identify malignancies while they are small. In contrast, cervical cancer screening (pap smears) seeks to identify pre-malignantcell changes. Screening for infectious diseases can identify sub-clinical casesneeding treatment and also prevent spread to the community. This is especiallyimportant to healthy persons who otherwise would be exposed to \"a carrier\" ofdisease. Screening, at least at its first level, may not require expensive equipmentor laboratory processing. Careful questioning and a focused brief observation 7 GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF HEALTH PROMOTION AND DISEASE PREVENTIONThe argument for prevention cannot\u2014 and should not\u2014be made primarily on economic grounds. The justificationfor prevention\u2014even when it does not save money\u2014is that it reducessuffering, makes disability and itsdiminishments less common, anddelays the arrival of death at thefamily's doorstep.51331_p019_028_r1 4/7/03 3:10 PM Page 7can reveal many conditions, from nutritional problems to dyspnea to schizo- phrenia\u2014and many more. This can be done by any trained health professional. Such measures as wearing auto seat belts do not prevent accidents but clearly reduce the severity of human injury. The continuous use of appropriate anti-bacterials to treat Hanson's Disease (leprosy) and tuberculosis reduces the riskthat the disease will spread to others and also halts the progression of pathologyin the patient. Because these measures keep trauma and disease from becomingmore severe after onset, they too are considered by some to constitute second-ary prevention. TERTIARY PREVENTION Tertiary prevention takes place after a disease or injury has occurred. It seeks notonly to prevent deterioration and complications from a disease or injury, butalso to rehabilitate and return the patient to as full physical, mental, and socialfunction as possible. This is primarily the work of health professionals, but thepublic needs to know the potential benefits of tertiary interventions and to ad-vocate giving them an appropriate priority in the light of a community's fullspectrum of health care needs. THE ACTUAL CAUSES OF DEATH When the public\u2014and health professionals\u2014think of the causes of death, they think of such things as heart disease, cancer, liver disease, or motor vehicle ac-cidents. These are just final diagnoses, however. What are the true causes thatlead to these final outcomes? McGinnis and Foege (1993) have identified thenon-genetic factors that increased total mortality in the United States and esti-mated their contributions to the ten leading mortality diagnoses. 8 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHTHE TEN \"TRUE\" LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH tobacco use exposure to poisons and toxins inadequate or excessive nutrition firearms (dietary habits) risky sexual behaviors inadequate aerobic exercise motor vehicle trauma excessive alcohol consumption use of illicit drugs lack of immunization against microbial agents These same ten contributing causes are important risk factors throughout the world, but their relative impact will vary depending on local environments andcultures. Simple epidemiologic study should enable each country to set its ownpreventive priorities.51331_p019_028_r1 4/7/03 3:10 PM Page 8The McGinnis and Foege study was based on a wide literature review and con- sensus estimates of the prevalence of risk factors, proportional attributable risks,and 1990 numbers of deaths by cause in the United States. Of 1,238,000deaths, approximately 400,000 were attributed to tobacco use; 300,000, to di-etary and activity patterns; 100,000, to excess alcohol use; 90,000, to microbialagents; 60,000, to toxic exposures; 35,000, to firearms; 30,000, to sexual be-havior; 25,000, to motor vehicles; and 20,000, to illicit-drug use. These pro-portional mortality rates by cause will differ by culture and geography. The goodnews is that all of these causes can be reduced by behavioral and social changes. Low socioeconomic status and inadequate access to medical care also raise mor- tality, but usually in interaction with the ten social behavioral factors listedabove. It is clear that these factors also contribute to long-term morbidity andimpaired quality of life, and they also help to raise the costs for medical care as-tronomically before death closes each case. THE NEXT STEP NEEDED TO ADVANCE \"HEALTH FOR ALL\" The causes and contributing risk factors for all the leading mortality and mor- bidity diagnoses in all nations are well established. Preventive measures to dealwith them are also well enough known to be able to initiate programs. As the pre-vious section demonstrates, the role of behavioral change in reducing every oneof the above-mentioned major causes of disease and trauma is clear at both theindividual and social levels. For the first time in the history of medical sciences,the first priority is not further discoveries in the basic physical and biological sci-ences, but rather the community-wide application of psychology and other so-cial and behavioral sciences for the purpose of putting well-proven preventivehealth measures into wider daily use. Many of the discoveries in the behavioralsciences are already being successfully applied to clinical medical and publichealth problems. Technology dealing with behavior change must be applied tohealth promotion in many more nations and communities and it must be taughtin every school for health professionals.

Principles of Community Health Intervention Community health programs will be most effective and conserve more resources if they are built upon a foundation of solved puzzles. This chapter will discusseach of these puzzling questions in sequence, with the goal of providing localcommunities with a foundation upon which to build a dependable structure forlocal health interventions. 11 PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNITY HEALTH INTERVENTIONPUZZLES TO SOLVE FOR BUILDING BETTER HEALTH What factors contribute to the excess number of specified diseases, disabilities, or deaths? How can these factors be changed? What additional protective or health giving elements can reduce these health problems? With what subpopulations shall work be done, and in what sequence, to solve the problem? What overall intervention strategies will yield the greatest results? Precisely what needs to be done\u2014and what can be omitted\u2014to reach the goals? STRATEGIES FOR IDENTIFYING CAUSES One of the early paradigms for explaining the spread of disease was the \"epi- demiological triangle\": This section will examine how the concepts of agent, host, and environment have expanded in meaning since they were first used early in the fight against infectiousdiseases. AGENT This term was first used to identify \"the cause\" of a disease, such as an infectious or parasitic agent. Today, agent also applies to excesses of heat, cold, dust, tox-ins, stressful events, instruments of injury, and even excessive amounts of calo-ries or fats in the diet. Shortages or deficiencies of factors also may be consideredAgent Environment Host51331_p029_048_r1 4/7/03 3:11 PM Page 11as agents, as in hunger, thirst, iron or iodine deficiencies, lack of adequate moth- ering, lack of social contacts, lack of employment, poverty, and hopelessness. In situations where no single element is a sufficient cause for disease, combina- tions of circumstances also can become agents. For example, among peoplewithout adequate protein, a serious lack of niacin will, in time, cause pellagra.This, however, occurs only among people who also lack tryptophan, such asthose who eat maize, sorghum, or millet as the primary grain in their diet.Witness the fact that Southeast Asians, whose basic staple is rice, seldom get pel-lagra. Another example involves cancers that develop only after cells have beendamaged in sequence by two separate chemical agents, then called co-carcino-gens. Finally, patients taking certain psychiatric drugs can become severely sun-burned and systemically sickened by only modest exposure to sunlight. What isthe agent of this malady\u2014the drug, the sunlight, both in combination? HOST The host also must be considered from several aspects. It can be the target ofdisease, as originally conceived, and it also can be the disease's contributingcause and perpetuator, as it has come to be viewed later. Public health's goal isto make the host a preventor much more of the time, as well as an active par-ticipant in the healing process. The host should not be viewed merely as a biological \"hunk,\" however. Rather, the host is a complex set of systems, as is clearly seen when conducting a \"reviewof systems\" in making a diagnosis. The challenge of disease prevention and healthpromotion may require an evaluation and a change in the cognitive, emotional,behavioral, and social statuses of individuals, groups, and even communities.These efforts are in addition to such actions as raising host resistance by improv-ing nutrition, providing immunizations, preventing immunodeficiency, and deal-ing with mood disorders, which can have many organic consequences. Consider how the following conditions, all of which are parts of the host, might modify a disease prevention plan: Rural residents who fear or distrust doctors might not bring their children forimmunizations or treatment. Families living in abject poverty will not be able to afford medicines nor fol-low the doctor's prescriptions. Urban subpopulations that live where violence is out of control may feel help-less and hopeless. People may be so depressed that they cannot function socially, staying athome and barely maintaining themselves. 12 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p029_048_r1 4/7/03 3:11 PM Page 12Among sexually promiscuous youth, antibiotics may treat the current infec- tion, but they won't prevent the next one. Some factory managers may feel they will go broke if they have to add an effec-tive chemical treatment system to the toxins they pour into the waterways. There may be proper citizens who see youth only as potential danger, andwould just as soon see the homeless die of disease or violence rather than payfor kinder alternatives. There may be aged persons living alone with no one to help them inemergencies. People may know that cigarette smoking is damaging, but cannot get moti-vated to stop. Chronic alcoholics may be unable to stay in rehabilitation programs. ENVIRONMENT In considering this term, we usually think first about what environmental scien-tists, engineers, and health inspectors have been dealing with for centuries\u2014such physical factors as air and water pol-lution, and solid waste disposal. Then we might consider such issues as highwayconstruction and product design, which alsohave come to concern environmental spe-cialists. The biophysical pathogens againstwhich environmental specialists have madegreat advances include reservoirs of infec-tion, insect and animal disease vectors, food-borne diseases, organic allergens, toxic chemicals, radiation, and person-to-persontransmission of disease in its various forms. All these remain very important, andpublic health programs in many nations have much work to do before all theplagues we know how to conquer have, in fact, been brought under control. At the same time, wise health professionals have for many years incorporated three more environmental levels into their work\u2014the interpersonal, social/economic, and cultural/ideological levels of every person's environment. Unfor-tunately, this knowledge and practice is not yet widespread. Interpersonal Level The elemental unit of the interpersonal environment is the dyad\u2014the inter-rela-tion between two persons. This begins with the bond between mother and child. 13 PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNITY HEALTH INTERVENTIONThe challenge of disease prevention and health promotion may require an evaluation and a change in the cognitive, emotional, behavioral, andsocial statuses of individuals, groups,and even communities. 51331_p029_048_r1 4/7/03 3:11 PM Page 13Even in lower mammals\u2014from mice to dogs, to elephants, and up to primates\u2014 separation of the infant from its mother's feeding, nurturing, and protection usu-ally means disease, deranged behavior, or death. This is even more striking in thehuman offspring, as many pediatric and psychiatric studies have shown. There is powerful preventive therapy in having a \"significant other\" or several caring persons who are close physically, mentally, and emotionally. This protec-tive effect actually begins before birth. A later section on pregnancy will describeseveral interpersonal factors during pregnancy that raise the risk for the baby tohave low birthweight or fetal anomalies. Similarly, loving and guiding family and friends can steer older children through the dangers and threats of adolescence and build a happy, caring personaladjustment and healthy habits that will last a lifetime. The quality of the rela-tionship, the emotional connection, and the mentoring appear more importantthan the amount of contact itself. In later childhood and teen years, the peer group becomes more important in shaping values, habits (including health habits), attitudes toward risk-taking,and whether expectations for the future are rewarding or punishing\u2014or neither!(\"Neither\" here refers to the numbing fatalism of some inner city youth, forexample, who have seen peers die suddenly.) Families, teachers, and health pro-fessionals need to become more active in steering youth to those peer groupswhose thinking and behaviors are constructive and healthy. The powerful therapy of a nurturing interpersonal environment continues throughout the adult years. In almost all nations, at all age strata over 25 years,married persons have lower death rates than persons the same age who aredivorced, widowed, or never married. Longitudinal population studies of lone-liness versus social supports have consistently shown that those with an ade-quate social network have lower death rates, even when controlled for otherelements such as health status and economic status at the beginning of the yearsof follow-up. Studies of the elderly show the same effect, and some organiza-tions and areas in Europe (Sweden, for example) are now providing elders wholive alone with opportunities for socializing, to see if this extends the number oftheir healthy, functional years of life. Social/economic Level Beyond direct, face-to-face interactions with family, neighbors, friends, cowork-ers, and members of one's religious or social group, lie the social structures ofthe community and nation. These include work groups, commercial enterprises,local governments, medical services, unemployment or disability assistance agen-cies, religious groups, civic betterment groups, professional associations, andmany others, as well as the ways they are organized and function. 14 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p029_048_r1 4/7/03 3:11 PM Page 14These social structures comprise far more than the sum of the people in them, and exert more power than separate individuals. They may cooperate and facil-itate, or debate, or remain passive when decisions are made about a variety ofissues. Some of these include water and sewage systems; electric and telephoneutilities; road building; schools; clinics and hospitals; how industry treats itsworkers and the environment; how prisons will be run; who is responsible forpublic health, disease prevention, and health promotion; who will provide med-ical care and at what level of modernity, and who will pay for it; and even whatthe laws of the land will be. It is obvious that these societal forces have a tremen-dous impact on everyone's health\u2014for better or for worse. From time to time,some of these social organizations will need to be targeted in order to enlistthem in improving the health of their communities or region. A population's low economic level is the strongest predictor of poor health and high mortality everywhere in the world. The next strongest predictor is low edu-cational level. This is true when comparing from country to country and alsowhen comparing districts within a country\u2014even those countries that providehealth care for all. These socioeconomicindicators are associated with a plethora ofdiseases and causes of injury that share lit-tle in their etiologies. They have been saidto predict every malady, but to explainnone. People who live in poverty havepoorer diets, poorer housing, more envi-ronmental pollution, more exposure topathogens, more dangerous occupations, less job security, more damaging lifecrises, less effective police and fire protection, more tobacco and alcohol use,and tend to follow lifestyles that raise risk factors. The poor have fewer physi-cal, psychological, and social protective resources, and they are usually power-less to improve their lot. (Also see Chapter 13) . The obvious solution is to eliminate poverty, but that has proven impossible to achieve and maintain in most eras and locations. The alternative is to identifythe major \"real\" causes of death and disability in disadvantaged neighborhoodsand enlist local government sectors and nongovernmental organizations to assistin reducing those environmental, individual, social, and cultural factors thatperpetuate the real causes of death. (See the section \"The Actual Causes of Death\" in Chapter 1). Cultural/ideological Level Culture consists of a society's framework of knowledge and beliefs, the content of its books and mass media, its technology, the determination of how socialroles are to be fulfilled, which behaviors are normal and which unacceptable, 15 PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNITY HEALTH INTERVENTIONA population's low economic level is the strongest predictor of poor healthand high mortality everywhere in theworld. The next strongest predictor islow educational level.51331_p029_048_r1 4/7/03 3:11 PM Page 15and which are its morals and value systems. It is culture that ranks the impor- tance of families versus individuals, of industriousness versus leisure. It is cul-ture that determines the relative value of competitiveness, equity among people,benevolence, valuation of health, and ultimate goals. A community's infrastruc-ture\u2014its roads, bridges, water, electricity, buildings, and medical technology\u2014might be viewed as part of the physical environment, but it all has been createdor borrowed by the culture. Culture is the way of life of a people. Like health and disease, culture is trans- mitted from group to group, from generation to generation. Witness the powerof television to transmit the culture of high-technology nations\u2014both the use-ful and the destructive aspects\u2014to every corner of the world. Raising the hopesfor a healthier, happier life has been useful, but marketing materialism, con-sumerism, aggression, and violence has been harmful. A community's ideology is part of its overall culture, and is often inferred, rather than seen. Ideology is the world of ideas, beliefs, and values in which the mem-bers of a society live. What people say is important to them is not always re-flected in their behavior, however, and the written plan for many institutions isoften not the \"real\" way they operate. In health planning, it is critical to under-stand this paradox. Culture tells its possessor what is important. It may value fame, sports skills, or conforming to friends. Or, it may tell who is important and who can be leftout\u2014perhaps women, ethnic minorities, the poor, and the powerless, who areoften neglected. The stream of illness generated in these subgroups by lack ofresources, lack of knowledge and skills, and lack of \"a way out,\" is forced underthe surface in many communities. But illness filters upwards to and through theroots of the upper and powerful classes, and the garden at the top soon ceasesto flourish. Culture also tells us what is possible and what is not. For example, villagers in Suriname's interior had known malaria as far back as their spoken history couldtrace. And, they used the statistically powerful \"persistency forecast\"\u2014the bestpredictor of the future is what has always happened in the past\u2014to accept thatmalaria would always be a part of their lives. By developing trust in healthworkers, however, who themselves had seen malaria eradicated in their owncommunities, Surinamese villagers were able to change their perception of what\"is possible,\" and so release hope and energy to eradicate the malaria scourge intheir own communities (Barnes and Jenkins, 1972). Millions of people scattered in smaller groups throughout cities and countryside do not believe it is possible\u2014or, perhaps, not sufficiently rewarding\u2014to alwaysdrive vehicles legally, to get along without street drugs, to get almost all of their 16 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p029_048_r1 4/7/03 3:11 PM Page 16children immunized, to prevent food poisoning, to stop family violence, to reduce heart attacks and strokes, and on and on and on. If they are to reachthese people, health workers must enlist the help of behavioral scientists andcommunicators to use available channels to change culture and ideology; tohelp fill the environment with ideas, interactions, and communication aboutnew beliefs about what is important; and to spread the idea that everyone isimportant and that far more is possible than current beliefs hold. USING THE EPIDEMIOLOGIC TRIANGLE IN PREVENTION PROGRAMS High rates of disease could be reduced sharply by appropriate changes in one or more of the three components\u2014host, agent, environment\u2014or in selected inter-actions among them. The triangle was first used to deal with infectious and parasitic diseases. Its application could go something like this: The infectious agent can be neutralized by disinfectants, heat, or radiation. The host's resistance can be raised passively or actively by immunization,exposure to a related but milder infectious agent, protective use of gammaglobulin, and improved nutrition. The environment can be \"treated,\" such as by eliminating reservoirs of theagent, proper disposal of toxic waste, chlorinating and fluoridating water sup-plies, and enforcing sanitary standards for food processors and restaurants. A toxic, infectious agent can be separated from the susceptible host by usingbarriers, protective devices on machines, protective clothing, the quarantineof infectious persons, or even the use of condoms. The spread of transmission of the agent can be halted. Some of the examplesabove also serve to block transmission, but to these must be added early casefinding and treatment (such as for tuberculosis, typhoid, or head lice);chemoprophylaxis (such as for malaria); vector control (for insects, snails,infected animals); sanitary disposal of human wastes; providing pure watersupplies; and putting in place aseptic techniques in medical facilities, day-carecenters, and nursing homes for the elderly. The five strategies shown in Table 2.1 also can be applied to different sorts of health problems. The table illustrates how strategies can be used to reduce suchwide ranging conditions and injuries as trauma from automobile accidents,ischemic heart disease, or cigarette smoking. 17 PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNITY HEALTH INTERVENTION51331_p029_048_r1 4/7/03 3:11 PM Page 17MULTIPLE CONTRIBUTING CAUSES Scientists in the 20th century have demonstrated that the causal matrix of dis- ease and injury was much more complex than Koch's postulates could explain.Ischemic (coronary) heart disease, for example, has many possible contributingcauses that can work cumulatively, interactively, or individually. And a singlenoxious agent (say, cigarettes) can cause or contribute to very different disorders(for example, emphysema, ischemic heart disease, or bladder cancer, to namejust a few). So, the simple linear thinking of early germ theorists\u2014the epi-demiological triangle and, even, the five prevention strategies\u2014must give way(for an increasing number of problems) to a conceptualization that includesboth causation and remediation as a probabilistic, multidimensional matrix of 18 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHTABLE 2.1.

Public Health and Human Ecology . East Hall; 18interactions: of etiology and a web of interventions , if you will. This discussion is included here in the hope of stimulating the reader to study boththe web of causation and the web of prevention imaginatively, and to find themost cost-effective ways to break the cycle of illness and injury in different cul-tures and communities. The struggle to control diseases that have multiple contributing causes, such as ischemic heart disease and most cancers, gave birth to the concept of risk fac-tors\u2014those elements in host, agent, or environment that increase the incidenceof specific health problems. The concept of protective factors soon followed,based on findings that physical exercise reduces atherosclerosis; that dietary folicacid reduces fetal anomalies; and that having a close, supportive, and encourag-ing family enhances child development. Preventive programs for many diseases and sources of injury follow the risk fac- tor strategy\u2014reducing risks and increasing protective factors. This approach has dramatically reduced many endemic diseases, ranging from heart diseaseand stroke to automobile fatalities and oralcancer. The field of mental illness preven-tion has now also adopted the \"risk factor-protective factor\" strategy to interveneagainst the complex neurological, psychi-atric, and social behavioral disorders in thatfield (Mrazek and Haggerty, 1994). (Also see Chapter 7.) A review of the prevention strategies reveals that each involves changing behav- iors. Some changes must come from community and government leaders, oth-ers must involve health professionals; many involve intersectoral cooperationand all require changing community priorities and personal and collectivebehavior of the public. SELECTING WHICH CONDITIONS TO PREVENT Prevention is a contest that must be won. To mount a program and then to haveit fail not only wastes money, it disillusions both the public and senior officialsregarding the value of future public health proposals. So how can the playingfield be set up so that prevention programs are sure to win? The entire plan should be worked out in advance, starting from how to present the plan's advantages to officials and the public, to what baseline measures willbe needed, what interventions will be done, how and with whom, how the out-come will be evaluated, and what budget and human resources will be needed. 19 PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNITY HEALTH INTERVENTIONPreventive programs for many diseases and sources of injury follow the riskfactor strategy\u2014reducing risks andincreasing protective factors.51331_p029_048_r1 4/7/03 3:11 PM Page 19Early on, it is critical to establish which condition is both of high priority to pre- vent and also has a high feasibility to be changed. The condition must be one thatis costly to the community or nation\u2014costly in terms of human suffering andeconomic impact. Ideally, the condition to be prevented should have a high preva-lence; cause suffering, prolonged disability, or death; lead to loss of time fromwork or normal childhood activities; and be expensive in terms of medical care. Respiratory infections, for example, have a high prevalence, but their severity is too low and they are self-remitting. They would not be an appropriate preven-tion target. And certain rare cancers, although severe and fatal, do not affectenough people to generate community support. A widespread preventive efforttargeting these cancers would not be cost-effective. Back injuries in industrialworkers, on the other hand, are very common in some jobs\u2014such as thoseinvolving twisting the body or doing heavy lifting\u2014are very costly to employ-ers, create chronic pain in affected workers, and often force workers to leavetheir line of work. All of these costs are high. Furthermore, the population to betargeted for intervention is relatively small, which limits costs. Preventive mea-sures targeting industrial back injuries have proven to be successful. Mortality statistics are the most comprehensively gathered health data world- wide. Where ministries of health cannot obtain reliable data from their wholenation, they often focus on a reasonable sample of areas for death registration,so national estimates can be made to guide health policy. Information on non-fatal disease and disability is much more difficult to collect reliably. The WorldHealth Organization (WHO), Harvard University, the World Bank, and othershave set up a cooperative system of data collection, evaluation, and statisticaladjustment of disability data. This project, called the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study, began publishing results in 1994,and has continued to do so at a rapid rate since(e.g., Murray and Lopez, 1996). The concept of an overall statistic that com- bines deaths and disability in a single estimateof burden of disease has been under develop-ment and refinement since about 1980. WHOhas approved the general concepts of DisabilityAdjusted Life Years (DALYs), Years Lived withDisability (YLDs), Years of Life Lost (YLLs), and related indicators. WHO has recommended more work on the equationsand weightings of variables. Future work with changed weights for specific diagnoses and more accurate assessment of numbers of cases, particularly from places where many conditionsare incompletely recorded, may change rank order and final estimates of theleading causes of lost life and health. The GBD estimates, however, are widely 20 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHAn ideal intervention target has three conditions\u2014it is a costly problem, it has moderate to high prevalence in a defined subpopulation, and effective interventions to address it are not unduly expensive.51331_p029_048_r1 4/7/03 3:11 PM Page 20accepted as the best available to date, and are dependable enough to serve as pol- icy guidelines (Murray and Lopez, 1996). These indicators, especially DALYs,will be incorporated into this handbook to help identify priorities. Another element that often enters into institutional or governmental decisions regarding which health problems receive high priority. For example, a medicaluniversity in a developing country gave its first priority to preventing ischemicheart disease. Although the condition was relatively rare in the area served bytheir medical facilities, two senior faculty members had had myocardial infarc-tions. And in the United States, the occurrence of an illness in the country's pres-ident is a good predictor of future appropriations for research on that topic. Incontrast, diseases and injuries common in people living in poverty, among thehomeless, or in groups who are criticized on moral grounds (such as illegal drugusers or homosexuals) often are given a much lower priority than their preva-lence, severity, and cost would warrant. Health professionals should be alert tothese biases and work to correct them, but, for the sake of effectiveness, shouldalways work in cooperation with formal and informal community leaders. SELECTING THE TARGET SUBPOPULATIONS TO RECEIVE HELP Many readers probably already are saying, \"Of course you help those who are sick.\" Or, \"No, we're talking prevention here. You intervene with those who areat risk of becoming sick or injured.\" Well, the answers are getting closer, but noprizes need be awarded yet. A community's health, as well as its continuing streams of ill health, is spread and sustained by a delicate, complex web of interactions among elements of thephysical, biological, interpersonal, socioeconomic, and cultural environments.The persons whose health is of concern rest in the center where all the strandscome together. Those persons are in constant interactive exchanges with differ-ent levels of their own functioning (biological, psychological, social, values, andlifestyle), as well as with the changing environments of their private worlds.Sometimes the easiest way to repair tears in the web, tears that bring illness andinjury, is to deal with other persons or circumstances, rather than with the high-risk person or group. The mechanisms of illness and injury are also interwoven, involving agents of disease, environmental circumstances, culture, socioeconomics, people and theirbehaviors. The task to be accomplished is simple to state, but difficult to achieve.Vaccination coverage rates need only be between 70% and 90% (depending onthe pathogen) for \"herd immunity\" to be adequate to prevent epidemics, butthat will not eliminate scattered individual cases. And cigarette smoking needsonly to continue declining steadily. Once a society starts to perceive smoking as 21 PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNITY HEALTH INTERVENTION51331_p029_048_r1 4/7/03 3:11 PM Page 21\"out of style,\" dirty, and harmful to the smoker andto others, then the momen- tum of social change will make the ashtray as obsolete as the cuspidor. The task, then, is to study the strong and weak spots in the web of health and in the web ofpathology to identify the very few linkages thatmust be broken\u2014or those that must be strength-ened\u2014to reduce morbidity and promote healthmost efficiently, with the fewest side effects, andat the lowest possible cost. Typically, such programs rely heavily on human interaction, and very little on advanced technology. In many cases, only limited groups need be targeted forinterventions to help many people. The following are successful examples thatmay spark the imagination of those considering starting programs. To deal with an endemic level of neonatal tetanus in Haiti, Drs. W. and G.Berggen first studied the local mode of tetanus transmission. They thendecided to work with traditional birth attendants to improve hygiene duringdelivery and to keep the newborn's navel free of infection after severing theumbilical cord. Neonatal tetanus dropped nearly to zero. To reduce the high level of infant and small child deaths in automobiles,many states in the United States have: (1) passed laws requiring that safetyseats be used by all children riding in cars and trucks; (2) solved the distri-bution problem by enlisting hospitals and well-baby clinics to loan safetyseats free of charge for several years, until the child is large enough to use reg-ular safety belts; (3) solved the financial problem by having civic organiza-tions, commercial enterprises, and others buy the seats and donate them foruse; and (4) solved the compliance problem by requiring police to keep aneye out for violations in automobiles they observe, and to fine those in vio-lation. The rates of child deaths in vehicles, as well as the extraordinarilylarger rates of trauma, have declined dramatically. Yes, the public was edu-cated about the problem and its solution, but the most critical interventionswere with legislators, health professionals, government agencies, and non-governmental and commercial resources. To reduce the rate of malaria transmission, anti-malarial medications are oftendistributed to populations. This is difficult where the population at risk is dif-ficult to reach and compliance is poor. In PAHO's campaign against malariain Suriname in the 1960s, the targets for intervention were storekeepers. Theywere given pink medicated salt to distribute free, in place of regular white salt,which was always sold. The pink color told the public that the product was\"the real thing\" and for free. Everyone needs salt, and free salt is, clearly, best.Acceptance was rapid and enthusiastic (Barnes and Jenkins, 1972). 22 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHOnce a society starts to perceive smoking as \"out of style,\" dirty, and harmful to the smoker and to others, then the momentum of social change will make the ashtray as obsolete as the cuspidor.51331_p029_048_r1 4/7/03 3:11 PM Page 22To cut the carnage wrought by motor vehicles, highway safety experts have successfully changed behaviors in four target groups: (1) highway engineersto get them to design safer roadways with better visibility, barriers whereneeded, and adequate signs; (2) vehicle designers and automobile companyexecutives to construct safer cars equipped with seat belts, better cushioning,collapsible steering columns, anti-lock brakes, and many other safety provi-sions; (3) individual drivers (especially youth) to drive more safely throughcourses, driver licensing, and systems that take away driving privileges for re-peated offenses; and (4) law enforcement personnel to enforce driving safetylaws by providing clear legislation with non-trivial penalties and by enlargingthe force to permit full enforcement of the laws. To improve dental health, an effective caries prevention involves providing ahealthy level of fluoride in public water supplies (about 0.7 parts per million).The persons that receive the most intervention in this effort have been com-munity leaders overseeing the water supply. In many communities in the past,this narrow approach created problems among some of the public, who feltthey had lost control of their city and its services. To overcome those prob-lems it may have been better to start with a public education program led byrespected professionals such as dentists, physicians, teachers, and the clergy,thereby laying to rest fears and issues about loss of control. Currently, mostorganized public opposition to fluoridation has ended, based on the splendidresults in so many communities. So, perhaps at this point a narrow interven-tion would be enough. It depends on the local culture. Working with both formal and informal community leaders can help health workers decide which community group should receive the most information,motivation, and help for the plan of action. For a pleasantly and effectivelyimplemented intervention for changing health, always work within and with as much of the community as possible. Never work onthe community, tothe community, or forthe community. Although most health promotion programs are directed at the general public, sometimes health promotion specialists enlist a target group to help them workwith other target groups. The three following examples show some of thesecases. When trained to identify the signs, schoolteachers can be the best case-find-ers for depressed, troubled, or neglected children. Health professionals may have the most influence in getting new mothers tobreastfeed. However, they also may need to change the father's attitude toenlist his support, and they may need the young mother's mother to giveencouragement. 23 PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNITY HEALTH INTERVENTION51331_p029_048_r1 4/7/03 3:11 PM Page 23Health professionals may need to educate community and regional officials about the importance of establishing a district public health clinic, but thevoting public and business leaders also may need to \"motivate\" officials to getthe job done. In Chapter 12 you will find a discussion about which commu-nity segments are likely to accept new programs first and which last. WORKING WITH THE WHOLE COMMUNITY OR ONLY WITH THE HIGH-RISK GROUP There are several convincing arguments for targeting a community risk-reduc- tion intervention only at high-risk individuals. For example: It keeps the programs smaller. The target group is likely to be highly motivated. Its members have learnedthat doctors can fix what is, or may come to be, wrong with them. Persons in the high-risk group have, as individuals, the most to gain by reduc-ing their higher probability of disease. Health professionals see this as what they have been trained to do, and so arewell motivated. The general public remains unbothered. There is, however, a convincing argument to the contrary for most widespread maladies. By targeting the intervention program at the whole community andgetting the most community members to lower their risk factor by a small per-centage, a much greater reduction in new cases and mortality will be achieved.This is the \"population strategy\" put forth by the late Professor Geoffrey Rose,Emeritus, from the London School of Hygiene (Rose, 1992) and others. In his book, Professor Rose used epidemiologic data to put forward the follow- ing points: Most biologic, psychological, and social parameters associated with rates ofdisease are distributed in a roughly normal, or bell shaped, curve in the pop-ulation. Blood pressure, IQ, and social participation are examples of such adistribution. It then follows that there are many more people that have mod-erate elevations of risk, compared to a few with extremely high risk. For many risk parameters, the chance of disease emergence is directly related(in some linear or nonlinear function) to the amount of deviancy (in eitherdirection) from the levels of the healthiest subgroup. For example, the higher 24 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p029_048_r1 4/7/03 3:11 PM Page 24the blood pressure, the greater the risk of pathology; or, the lower the intake of protein in infants, the greater the risk of growth stunting. The percentage of people over any \"high-risk cutoff point\" (e.g., 160 mmHg/ 95 mmHg for blood pressure) is highly correlated with the population meanfor that variable. The largest number of \"cases\" do not occur at the extreme \"tail\" of the riskfactor distribution curve, but rather in the much larger group above themedian, roughly from the 55th to the 90th percentile. By moving the entire population toward lower risk will lower the populationmean modestly and lower the number of high-risk persons considerably. Table 2.2 is taken from the screening phase of the United States Multiple Risk Factor Intervention T rial (MRFIT). The data are tabulated from ProfessorRose's discussion of the original publication in Lancet . 1 Row No. 1 in Table 2.2 shows the distribution of total serum cholesterol values observed in 361,000 United States men aged 35-57 years old who volunteeredto participate in a study of men at higher risk of ischemic heart disease. This wasnot a representative sample. Based on earlier population studies (including theone conducted in Framingham, U.S.A., and others), the risk of ischemic heartdisease attributable to total cholesterol was apportioned among the nine levelsin percentages, as shown in row No. 2. The power of the total cholesterol riskfactor (row No. 3) is shown by dividing the percentage of deaths attributable to total cholesterol by the percentage of the group that generated them. Thepotency keeps rising with level of total cholesterol, as past research has taughtus to expect. The message to take home from Table 2.2 is that intervening with the entire population enough to shift the whole population's distribution of total choles-terol lower by only 0.5 mmol\u2014one category\u2014would reduce ischemic heart dis-ease mortality attributable to total cholesterol by about 34%. In contrast, amuch larger reduction\u2014three categories, or 1.5 mmol\u2014applied to every high-risk person ( 6.0 mmol total cholesterol), but to no lower risk person, would achieve only an 18% reduction in ischemic heart disease mortality. Table 2.2 illustrates more of Rose's arguments. When the common conditions are met\u2014the risk factor has a bell-shaped dis- tribution and the rates of disease keep increasing for each increment in the 25 PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNITY HEALTH INTERVENTION1Lancet ii; 1986, pp. 933-936.51331_p029_048_r1 4/7/03 3:11 PM Page 25risk factor\u2014then the population approach saves more lives and prevents more illness than the high-risk approach. This does not necessarily mean it ismore cost-effective. The costs of each approach and the size of the targetedgroups also must be considered. The population approach is more likely to be preferable in the following sce- narios: (1) when the risk factors are widely diffused throughout the commu-nity; (2) when the gradient of disease risk continuously rises as the risk factorbecomes more extreme; (3) when it is impossible or too expensive to separate 26 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHTABLE 2.2.

This results in the community experiencing only 65.7% of its earlier mortality\u2014over a 34% decline.51331_p029_048_r1 4/7/03 3:11 Page 26the susceptible from the non-susceptible groups or persons; and (4) when the intervention is better achieved at a group or population level rather than atan individual level (for example, changing eating patterns of families orschool groups; fluoridating the water supply, rather than hiring hundreds ofdental aids to find and treat every child and adolescent). The high-risk approach will be more effective: (1) when the risk conditionsare highly restricted (for example, exposure to fumes and solvents amongfurniture workers); (2) when susceptibility is limited and obvious (for exam-ple, persons with white, rather than tan or brown, skin for strict teachingabout sun exposure and skin cancers); (3) when there is a \"risk threshold\"below which a risk factor confers no added danger andthe low risk subpop- ulation can be easily identified; or (4) when the intervention causes enoughinconvenience so that only high-risk, motivated persons will adhere to the hy-gienic program (for example, diabetics and pre-diabetics following neededstrict dietary programs). The population approach also reduces the size of the high-risk portion of the population. Rose (1992) estimates the reductions as follows: If high risk for systolic blood pressure begins at 140 mmHg, reducing a pop-ulation's mean systolic blood pressure by 3% will decrease the number in thehigh-risk group by 25%. If excess body weight is judged to be more than 92 kg, reducing the popula-tion's mean weight by 1 kg (about 1%) will cut the number of excess weightpersons by 25%. If heavy drinkers of alcohol are defined as persons drinking 300 ml of ethanolor more each week, reducing the drinking population's average ethanol intakeby 10% will cut the number of heavy drinkers by 25%. Comparisons of distributions of values of risk factors, such as those above in numerous populations, reveal that populations differ in means but not in theshape of the distribution. The above calculations are based on that assumption. THE PREVENTION PARADOX The paradox goes something like this: preventive interventions often mustinvolve many, many people in order to help just a few. This is an issue that datesback at least to the first immunization campaigns in the 1890s. And even in theearly part of the 20th century, when diphtheria was epidemic, preventive pro-grams had to immunize about 600 children to prevent one death. Of course,numerous non-fatal cases also were prevented. Similarly, today thousands of 27 PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNITY HEALTH INTERVENTION51331_p029_048_r1 4/7/03 3:11 PM Page 27persons are wearing their automobile seatbelts for thousands of days each, for just one life to be saved. These are examples of preventive measures\u2014risk factor reductions\u2014that bring large benefits to the population as a whole, but little or no benefit to most par-ticipating persons. Such high ratios of participants to persons benefiting mustalways be the case in situations where we know there will be many destructiveevents in a population but do not know who might become the victim. The message for health promotion is to make preventive actions automatic and habitual, emphasizing their ease and simplicity, and also stressing that failure todo the preventive act may generate only a tiny risk but represents a huge pen-alty to anyone who becomes a victim. As Table 2.2 demonstrates, having manypersons exposed to a modest risk of disease or injury costs a community farmore damage than having a small number of persons exposed to a high risk. Whether to choose the high-risk approach or the population approach hinges on several additional factors, including the inconvenience or possible side effectsof the intervention program on persons at minimal risk and the shape of thegradient of potency of the risk factor. For example, a U-shaped effect\u2014whenboth being too high and being too low are harmful\u2014calls for the kind of pro-gram that encourages both extremes toward safe moderation. These decisionsneed to be worked out with the input of expert consultants. The purpose of thisdiscussion is to alert all health workers to the issues and the options. SPECIFYING THE CHANGES IN BEHAVIORS AND ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRED TO REACHTHE HEALTH GOALS Once the type of health problem against which to intervene has been selected, as well as the population subsets whose changes in behavior will reduce theproblem, those planning the program are ready to specify precisely whatchanges need to be made. A vague goal will doom public health leaders andworkers to an enterprise akin to trying to catch a cloud in a butterfly net. A pre-cise, operationally defined goal, on the other hand, will provide focus (thuseliminating unnecessary activities) and enable quantitative evaluation (both be-fore the program begins and after it ends), both for the behavioral and envi-ronmental changes that the program aims to achieve and for the improvedhealth outcomes the program is intended to produce. Goals should be stated in terms of specific, measurable results. They should not be stated in terms of resources spent or activities conducted. For example, it isnot recommended that a goal be set such as, \"Use 25 nurses to do home visitsto educate people about risk factors for cancer.\" Rather, state an outcome ori- 28 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p029_048_r1 4/7/03 3:11 PM Page 28ented goal, such as, \"Raise public awareness of cancer risk factors so that 80% of adults know risk factors for cancer of the lung, head, neck, liver, and bowel.\"The following three examples of a third approach are more behaviorally ori-ented: \"Decrease the proportion of adults (X%) who smoke cigarettes by 20%\";or \"Decrease the X% who drink more than 7 alcoholic drinks per week by20%\"; or \"Increase the X% who consume both three fruits or vegetables andtwo fiber-rich foods each day by 20%.\" Evaluation should be made in terms ofmeasured changes. Since the cancers above may take 20 to 30 years to develop,early evaluation must be conducted in terms of risk factor changes. Don't lookfor changes in health statistics until the \"incubation period\" of the disease inquestion has elapsed. Simply to make people \"more health conscious and knowl-edgeable\" is not helpful, unless it spills over into measurable actions that reallyprevent disease. Goals set for health interventions also should be attainable. Reducing the inci- dence of diarrhea in day care centers by 90% is not an attainable goal for thefirst intervention in most places. If a 20% reduction seems easy, set your goal at30%, not at 50%. With some extra effort, you have a good chance of reaching30% the first year, and then set another 30% reduction as the second year's goal.The prevention specialist should weigh the attitude of both health workers andthe target population: Will they work harder the second year if they achievetheir goal, if they fall somewhat short of it, or if they fail badly? Most behaviorchange specialists believe that a sequence of small or moderate successes is thebest way to build morale, self-efficacy, and commitment for future goals\u2014bothamong health workers and among the participating public. Careful analysis of the etiology of a disease or class of trauma will usually reveal severalrisk factors in the people who later becomevictims. Certain places and times also con-fer greater risk. There are usually potentialinterventions to change the environment,to separate the agent from the host, or toactivate any other of the five strategies forprevention (see Table 2.1). In general, combating a problem by launching two or more interventions simul- taneously is often more effective than carrying out a single intervention, but italso can be more costly. The goal is to select cost-effective ways of intervening,and to combine them if indicated. For example, some malaria control programs follow a probability model both to attack the vector (mosquitoes) and to raise human resistance with antimalarialmedications. If the number of mosquitoes can be cut by half and the number of 29 PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNITY HEALTH INTERVENTIONMost behavior change specialists believe that a sequence of small ormoderate successes is the best way to build morale, self-efficacy, andcommitment for future goals\u2014bothamong health workers and among the participating public.51331_p029_048_r1 4/7/03 3:11 PM Page 29susceptible hosts can be cut by half (assuming equal and independent effects from each intervention and no changes in other factors), one would expectmalaria transmission to fall to one-quarter of its previous rate. A similar multi-pronged approach also works well for highway safety and many other conditions. In general, a program designed to change behavior and attitude will always be needed to gain public acceptance of environmental and health service programs.A highly successful polio immunization program conducted in the 1960s, whenlive-virus polio vaccine was new, was organized to include health professionals;elementary schools; churches; supermarkets; county offices; factories; billboards in two languages; com-munity volunteers; and civic clubs. This enthusiastic, multi-faceted and many-channeled approach set records for community participation. The facilities, workhours, and media coverage were mostly free gifts to the health campaign. This\"community saturation approach\" is still being used with encouraging success. The channels to be used to reach people, the nature of the message, and the times and places for providing services will differ greatly depending on thenature of the target disease and that of the target population. As an exercise,think how you would plan a program targeting measles in children, breast can-cer in middle-aged women, AIDS among intravenous drug users, sexually trans-mitted diseases in teenagers, or reactive depression in recently widowed persons. Before continuing, think about and write the nature and content of the pro- gram to be designed for each of these diseases and population subgroups, as wellas where, how, and by what sorts of workers the services are to be rendered. Savethe notes. You may want to review them after reading Chapter 12. Chapter 12, on changing behavior, will provide further guidelines to use in planning for such programs. Before that, however, Chapters 3 through 6 in PartII will review the major health problems at each stage of life and will examinehow they can be reduced. 30 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p029_048_r1 4/7/03 3:11 PM Page 30PART II. IMPROVING HEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFE CYCLE51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 313. Infants and Children up to 14 Years Old IN PREGNANCY A healthy pregnancy and safe delivery are the essential foundation to a joyful and productive life. A damaged pregnancy, however, can result in mortality,malformation, and impaired functional status\u2014both physically and men-tally\u2014that can last a lifetime. Infant mortality (babies who die before their first birthday) is a traditional in- dicator of a population's overall health. As such, WHO has included it as amajor indicator in its Global Strategy of Health for All (Rutter and Quine,1990). Specific diagnoses for death during infancy may be assigned unreliablybecause often several contributing causes are present simultaneously and the as-signment to primary cause is arbitrary or follows local custom. Mortality data for 1993 in the United States suggests, however, that among live births who die before age 1, about 50% die from conditions that started dur-ing prenatal life. Their deaths are coded as being due to such conditions as con-genital anomalies, disorders related to prematurity, low birthweight, respiratorydistress of newborn, and maternal and perinatal complications (CDC, 1996).The risk factors for death, malformation, and disability, however, are moreclearly defined and often preventable. Poor nutrition, infections, and toxins are the three most frequent, yet prevent- able, causes of infant disability and mortality. Complications of pregnancy,often rooted in the first three causes, add their toll as well. The foundations forhealthy babies come from educating and motivating youth well before their fer-tile years. Potential problems can be monitored and often prevented by alertprenatal care begun in the first trimester and continued throughout pregnancy.Poor nutrition is more often due to a lackof protein, minerals (especially iodine andiron), and vitamins (especially folic acid),than to simple caloric deficits. However,women who are seriously deprived of foodusually show all the deficiencies listed. Infectious diseases can either interfere with the mother's body's ability to trans- mit adequate nutrients through the placenta, or the infectious agents themselves 33 INFANTS AND CHILDREN UP TO 14 YEARS OLDPoor nutrition, infections, and toxins are the three most frequent\u2014andpreventable\u2014causes of infantdisability and mortality.51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 33(or their toxins) can pass directly into the fetus. Rubella, dengue, HIV, hepatitis B, and other sexually transmitted diseases (e.g., gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis,herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus) are among those cancross the placenta (Cates and Holmes, 1986:257-281; and Hutchinson and San-dall, 1995). Pregnant women at high risk for the above conditions should bescreened for them at the first opportunity to protect the baby. All pregnantwomen should be screened as shown in the \"Screening Checklist for PregnantWomen\" later in this chapter. Diarrheal diseases and intestinal parasites reducethe nutrient stores in the mother, and, if severe enough, can malnourish the fetus(Perez-Escamilla and Pollitt, 1992; Last, 1986, pp. 1515-1531). Research in recent decades has highlighted the damaging effects of \"everyday tox- ins\" such as those contained in cigarette smoke and alcohol. It has been wellestablished that these are risk factors for low birthweight\u2014which is a commonintermediary for immature development\u2014congenital anomalies, and infant mor-tality. Alcohol consumption can cause fetal alcohol syndrome, with its characteris-tic stigmata and disabilities. Even lesser amounts of maternal drinking are believedto cause non-specific damage, based on animal research. Many illegal drugs, andeven some legitimate medications used inappropriately, can damage the fetus orcreate a state of acute narcotic withdrawal immediately after the baby is born. Co-caine is particularly damaging (Frank, Bresnahan, and Zuckerman, 1996). Poor family functioning was found to be a predictor both of intrapartum com- plications and low birthweight in a study group of U.S. women of lower eco-nomic levels (Reeb et al., 1987). The study used three scales of family function-ing. All of them asked about the woman's perception of her family's helpfulnessand emotional support, her satisfaction with these circumstances, and her satis-faction with her family's performance in terms of taking care of the family'sneeds and getting along together without conflict. Discriminant function analy-sis showed poor family function, age over 35 years, and full-time employmentoutside the home to be the three strongest predictors of complications of preg-nancy and delivery. Poor family functioning and more stressful life events werethe strongest predictors of low birthweight. (See also Rutter and Quine (1990)for further documentation that life stresses and low socioeconomic status in-crease rates of low birthweight.) Ten biomedical variables were also evaluated,but they each had smaller predictive values. The relative strengths of risk factorsvary by the stage of economic development and frequency of damaging diseases. The main reason life stress may affect pregnancy outcome appears to be because it creates continuing anxiety and feelings of distress, which, in turn, change thelevels of glucocorticoids, corticotrophin-releasing hormone, beta endorphins,and the interaction of the hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal system. A compre-hensive review of the effects of stress and anxiety on pregnancy outcomes, theendocrinology involved, and possible treatment strategies has been presented byLederman (1995, a and b). 34 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 34Low birthweight, often caused by the factors above, has other less defined causes as well. Low birthweight, in turn, is a contributing cause to many phys-ical and psychoneurological problems that emerge later in childhood. (See Chapter 7 for details.) Excellent reviews of social inequalities in pregnancy outcome (Rutter and Quine, 1990), causes and consequences of intrauterine growth retardation (Perez- Escamilla and Pollitt, 1992), preventive perinatology for developing countries(Torres-Pereyra, 1988), and prevention of infant mortality by nurse-midwives(Willis and Fullerton, 1991) provide data and recommended actions for makingpregnancy and infancy healthier. WHO estimates that about 17% of the 122.3 million babies born worldwide each year have a low birthweight\u2014under 2,500 g. The low birthweight rate was18% in developing countries, but only 7% in industrialized countries (WorldHealth Organization, 1980). Low birthweight babies have twice to four timesthe risk of dying in their first 3 days of life compared to normal weight babies,and the survivors are more likely to suffer impaired intelligence. Complicationsof pregnancy and delivery that involve fetal anoxia have been implicated as riskfactors for schizophrenia emerging in the third decade of life (Mrazek and Hag-gerty, 1994). For babies whose pregnancies and deliveries leave residual physio-logic dysfunctions involving the autonomic nervous system, the risks of conductdisorders later in childhood are raised fivefold (Mrazek and Haggerty, 1994).Low birthweight babies also have higher risks for many other abnormalities. (Also see Chapter 7.) The material deprivation experienced by the poor, both in industrialized anddeveloping countries, exacts a toll in the form of damaged pregnancies, fetalgrowth retardation, sick babies, and higher infant death. Clearly, impoverishedareas are the places of greater need for preventive programs\u2014but much of thefetal and infant damage is mediated by psychosocial, behavioral, and culturalcorrelates of poverty which can be modified by the determined efforts of healthprofessionals and community resources (Rutter and Quine, 1990). The two main strategies for improving in- fant health and development are: (1) reduc-ing the frequency of low birthweight, and(2) increasing the delivery of prenatal care,both by starting care earlier in the pregnancyand by improving the rate of keeping subse-quent appointments at the prenatal clinic. Much research has shown that early and comprehensive prenatal care can improve pregnancy outcomes. Such care pro-vides early detection of correctable risk factors in the pregnant woman and 35 INFANTS AND CHILDREN UP TO 14 YEARS OLDThe material deprivation experienced by the poor, whether in industrializedor developing countries, exacts a toll in the form of damaged pregnancies,fetal growth retardation, sick babies,and higher rates of infant death.51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 35provides her support to make the necessary arrangements for the latter portion of pregnancy, delivery, and early infant care. Comprehensive descriptions of the recommended services and scheduling for prenatal care are published by national health authorities and can be found intextbooks of obstetrics. The list of prenatal risk factors, which follows in thissection, should be used as a supplementary source. The first task of regional orcommunity health authorities is to make prenatal services available, convenient,and culturally acceptable. The social groups at highest risk for prenatal andperinatal complications, low birthweight, and fetal anomalies, are people in lowsocioeconomic status and cultural minorities. Low family income, unemployment, low education, poor housing, and lack of transportation each makes its independent\u2014and interactive\u2014impact to lower theutilization of prenatal care. If health care workers speak the same language the pa-tients speak at home, the rate of women coming for initial care and keeping ap-pointments is increased. Effective social networks in the community can be en-listed to encourage pregnant women to come for care (Willis and Fullerton,1991). Health agencies must become proactive to enlist community participation. The literature reviews have good agreement on the risk factors for low birth- weight and fetal anomalies. The most detailed list appears in Willis and Fuller-ton (1991). RISK FACTORS FOR LOW BIRTHWEIGHT, FETAL ANOMALIES, AND INFANT DEATHS Social Risk Factors poverty and its correlates; low education of the mother (illiterate mothers experience three times the infant mortality rate in some areas compared to mothers who have finishedhigh school (PAHO 1994, 1998, 2002); unmarried status (even after age and education are accounted for); poor family functioning, low emotional and practical helpfulness. Personal Biological Factors mother is too young (early teens); mother is too old (mid-40s or older); 36 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 36there are fewer than two years between pregnancies\u2014a factor that can dou- ble infant mortality (PAHO, 1994, 1998, and 2002); the mother is obese; the mother is markedly underweight before pregnancy; the mother does not gain enough weight during pregnancy; the mother is undergoing her first pregnancy. Personal Behavioral Factors the mother smokes cigarettes; the mother consumes any alcohol; the mother uses illegal drugs; the mother misuses legal medications not approved as safe for use duringpregnancy; the mother is exposed to workplace or farm toxins (chemicals, solvents, pes-ticides, some liquid fuels); the mother is exposed to infections (including sexually transmitted infectionsand poverty-related infections); the mother undergoes adverse life events without social support; the mother has inadequate nutrition before and during pregnancy (popula- tion malnutrition is discussed in Chapter 13); the mother receives insufficient professional prenatal care or it comes too late. Psychological Risk Factors1 the mother experiences chronic elevated levels of anxiety or depression (Rut- ter and Quine, 1990); the mother undergoes a high frequency of stressful life events, especially inthe absence of social supports (Lederman, 1995). 37 INFANTS AND CHILDREN UP TO 14 YEARS OLD1This list is derived from Willis and Fullerton, 1991.51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 37Note how these risk factors are heavily weighted with social conditions and be- havioral habits. The steps to achieving the goal of reduced infant mortality anddisability must follow the route of changing cultural norms and social expecta-tions for women of childbearing age by educating and motivating each com-munity and by supporting behavior change in individual women before theirpregnancies begin. (The general strategies of community intervention were presented in Chapter 2, and the technology for changing risk fac-tors will be explained in Chapter 11.) SCREENING PREGNANT WOMEN Some localities may have many screening procedures, while others may have con- siderably fewer. The following checklist2includes those procedures best demon- 38 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH2Various sources were used to compile the list, primarily the United States Preventive Services Task Force, 1996.SCREENING CHECKLIST FOR PREGNANT WOMEN 1. For iron deficiency anemia; 2. For pre-eclampsia via blood pressure measurement at each prenatal visit;3. For weight: is mother clearly underweight or clearly obese; does she gain weight ap- propriately during pregnancy? 4. For tobacco use: urge and motivate stopping totally, at least during pregnancy and lactation; 5. For alcohol use: ask whether mother drinks and how much in a non-judgmental manner, then urge and motivate total cessation for the duration of pregnancy andlactation; 6. For mood altering drugs: ask about use in a non-threatening way, then urge cessation for duration of pregnancy, preferably permanently\u2014drugs will damage fetus but notabort it; 7. For medications being taken, including over-the-counter compounds\u2014urge discontin- uance of all substances not known to be safe for the fetus; 8. For eating of non-food substances such as clay, starch, special folk-cure earths (ingesting such substances is sometimes called \"pica of pregnancy\")\u2014some of thesemay contain traces of heavy metals (e.g., lead), other toxins, salts, or merely \"emptycalories.\" Urge stopping practice by substituting something safe to chew on or eat; 9. For asymptomatic bacteruria via urine test; 10. For rubella: ask about prior vaccination; if none, follow patient closely for infectious episodes during pregnancy, but do not immunize until after delivery; 11. For hepatitis B virus: based on community prevalence, do blood test to detect active (acute or chronic) infection; 12. For syphilis and for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in all pregnant women;13. For gonorrhea and chlamydia: via sexual history and physical exam in all women; in higher risk women, by lab culture; 14. For Rh-incompatibility (now called D-blood typing and antibody screening).51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 38strated to be beneficial and efficient. As always, the availability and cost of cer- tain technologies in the local setting will influence which procedure is selected. Priorities for including or excluding items from all the screening checklists in- cluded in this Handbook should be based upon the local prevalence and seri-ousness of conditions and the local practicality and effectiveness of the proposedaddition to program protocols. For example, investing in extending oral rehy-dration therapy may save more suffering than screening newborns for phenylke-tonuria abnormality. The best \"screening device\" is a health professional who examines methodically, observes acutely, asks wisely, and listens intently to the mother and child. Thehealth worker can then prioritize the more technical procedures based on theprevalence of conditions in the community and individual patient risk factors.Some of the screening items may not be feasible in underserved or under-equipped areas. Other items can be estimated clinically, such as iron-deficiencyanemia by observing nail beds or eyelid mucosa, when laboratory tests are notcheaply available. FROM BIRTH THROUGH AGE 4 YEARS This section deals with the major causes of death and disability in childrenthrough age 4. 3The patterns of mortality differ, depending on whether a nation has an all-cause, age-specific mortality rate for ages 1-4 that is greater thanabout 150 deaths per 100,000 children of those ages or whether a nation's ratesfall under about 120 per 100,000. Nations with rates between 120 and 150 canfollow either pattern. For nations with higher rates of early childhood deaths, the leading cause (using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9)) is infectious and parasiticdiseases, followed by intestinal diseases and respiratory diseases. External causesusually rank fourth, but sometimes are higher. For nations with lower early childhood mortality, external causes (including ac- cidents, neglectful or intentional trauma) usually are the leading cause of death,with drowning common especially for boys. Congenital anomalies or infectiousand parasitic diseases usually run second in frequency. 39 INFANTS AND CHILDREN UP TO 14 YEARS OLD3Mortality figures are drawn from selected nations that have reported their age- and sex-specific mortality to the World Health Statistics Annual in recent years and from the Global Burden of Disease Study (Murray and Lopez (eds.), 1996). The impact of disability from non-fatal condi-tions and their responsible risk factors is drawn from estimates by the Global Burden of DiseaseStudy (Murray and Lopez, 1997, a-d) and from Jos\u00e9 L. Bobadilla and colleagues (1994).51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 39In nations that have warm climates year round, the many \"tropical diseases\" exact a heavy toll, especially among young children, resulting in impaired de-velopment, risk of recurrent disease, or, all too often, death. The world's mostprevalent communicable diseases include malaria, tick-borne diseases, oral-fecal transmit-ted parasitic worms, and diseases associated with poor sanitation. These diseasesoften arrive as epidemics in communities and remain endemic thereafter. As re-cently as 1990, malaria alone caused an estimated 31 million healthy life yearslost (QALYs) in the world's children. This figure includes both deaths and thedisability among survivors. Control of these diseases may involve separating flying insects from people by screening, insecticide spraying, chemoprophylaxis, using \"clean\" water and food,improving sanitation, separation from or pharmacologic treatment of humancarriers, and changing various environmental aspects. Malaria, schistosomiasis,and other diseases involving living vectors can be prevented successfully only bylarge-scale community and regional programs. Much useful guidance in this re-gard can be obtained from recent editions of Control of Communicable Diseases in Man (Chin, 2000). The role of local health professionals and the public is to advocate specific community preventive interventions as needed and to assist intheir successful completion. An underlying determinant of the severity\u2014the risk of permanent disability or death\u2014of all these children's diseases is the children's nutritional state. Protein-en-ergy malnutrition and iron-deficiency anemias are estimated to be responsible fora total loss of more than 45 million life years of healthy function\u2014Disability Ad-justed Life Years (DALYs) (Murray and Lopez, 1997, a-d). Vitamin A deficiencyadds to these losses by causing eye lesions, which can lead to blindness. This de-ficiency also affects the skin and reduces resistance to infections. Malnutrition isseldom coded as the primary cause of death, but it aggravates respiratory disor-ders, diarrheas, and the immunizable diseases, and they, in turn, drain out whatlimited nutritional reserves remain in the body. Nutritional diseases are commonin developing countries and among poor families everywhere, especially in urbansettings. Even in wealthier nations, malnutrition can be found in children, adults,and the elderly in impoverished areas. (Malnutrition as a community and re- gional problem is discussed in the section on malnutrition in Chapter 13.) Breastfeeding provides the best nutritional start in a baby's life. A well-nourished mother provides better nourishment for her baby, as well as essential immuno-logic protection. Breast milk can be fed exclusively until such time as the baby'srate of growth falters (slows down from local averages). This usually occurs be-tween 4 to 6 months of age (Hijazi et al., 1989). In some places, a child's par-tial breastfeeding may continue for as long as 24 months of age. 4 40 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH4See Jakobsen et al. (1993) for methods of promoting breastfeeding.51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 40Extended breastfeeding delays the return of regular menses in most women. It also reduces the frequency and severity of diarrheas and respiratory infections ininfants and tends to protect against obesity developing when the babies reachchildhood and adolescence. In a study in New Zealand that followed more than1,000 children for 18 years, longer duration of breastfeeding was associated withmeasurable advantages in cognitive ability at ages 8 to 13 years and higher scoreson school-leaving examinations (Horwood and Fergusson, 1998). The United States Government initiative \"Healthy People 2010\" urges that breastfeeding be continued until at least age 6 months. Studies show that givingnew mothers promotional material from manufacturers of infant formula en-courages many of them to give up breastfeeding as early as two weeks after thebaby's birth. For most this is an unhealthy choice. The solution to these nutritional problems is adequate food\u2014enough calories; protein sources; green, yellow, and other vegetables and fruits. Iodine deficiencycan be remedied by area-wide distribution of iodized salt. Vitamin A deficiencycan be dealt with by fortifying a staple food or by large oral doses twice yearly.Both Vitamin A supplementation (included in WHO's \"EPI-plus\" program)and iodine supplementation (where required) are extremely cost effective interms of healthy life years gained for the money spent (Bobadilla, 1994). Text-books on public health nutrition also will be useful in this regard. The probability that a child born live will live to his fifth birthday depends largely onwhere that child lives. The World Bank hasutilized mortality statistics for the latter 1980s from 169 nations and reportingareas to project the estimated percentages of live-born children who will die be-fore turning 5 years old. The estimates are available from the original source foreach reporting nation (Feacham et al. (eds.), 1992). Table 3.1 summarizes thesedata by six geographic/economic regions and shows both median percentagesand ranges of percent mortality in the 1980s and 1990s. Mortality medians differ substantially across regions: 12-fold differences for males, and nearly 17-fold differences for females. The ranking for regional mor-tality before age 5 follows that for economic development. In all nations, boyshave higher rates than girls. Even more important for health policy-makers arethe wide ranges of child mortality within each region. Within Latin Americaand the Caribbean, for example, the range is 10-fold for males and 12-fold forfemales. Other transitional and developing regions show similar disparities. Thistable can be read as a score card on child health for regions and nations, but itcan far more productively be used as a searchlight of opportunity, to guide na-tions and districts to the subpopulations in greatest need and to the nature ofthose health needs. The remainder of this chapter will review major ways to savechildren's lives and health. 41 INFANTS AND CHILDREN UP TO 14 YEARS OLDBreastfeeding provides the best nutritional start in a baby's life.51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 41PREVENTION AND EARLY DETECTION OF DEVELOPMENTAL PROBLEMS The path of choice is primary prevention\u2014keeping the risk factors from ever arriving. The section on pregnancy reviews the steps to take. (Protection for the central nervous system is further discussed in Chapter 7.) As for secondary prevention, some developmental problems can be prevented by early detection of risk; others can be reversed, or at least have their damage min-imized, if treated early. Detection without treatment not only is useless, it actu-ally may cause harm by creating anxiety and guilt in parents who feel helpless infacing their child's problem without any solution. T reatment may be curative orit may help the children learn ways to keep their disabilities from impairing theirfunctioning too seriously. Human beings possess a great force for life and growth,and this force is strongest in children. Caring health professionals and a lovingfamily can help remove some barriers to children's growth and development. Screening Checklist for Newborns 1. For congenital hypothyroidism; 2.

PREVENTING POSTNATAL DISABILITIES A healthy pregnancy can prevent many congenital defects, but a considerablenumber of permanent limitations and disabilities develop after birth. Amongthese (depending on the nation) are malnutrition and growth stunting evolvingfrom inadequate calories and proteins in the baby's diet. These are aggravatedby diarrhea, sequelae of childhood infections, parasitic diseases, and trauma(both accidental and inflicted). All these causes can be diminished by social andbehavioral changes. In a review of the epidemiology of developmental disabilities (including both those of prenatal and postnatal origin), Lipkin (1991) concludes that develop-mental disabilities overall appear about as frequently as the most common of se-rious pediatric diseases. Hence, their prevention is vitally important to improvechild health. In the United States, a 1987 survey estimated that almost 1% of children under age 18 years had some kind of physical impairment. Psychological and neuro-logical impairments were counted separately. The most frequent impairmentswere orthopedic (0.35%), two-thirds of which affected the lower limbs. Speechand hearing impairments were next in frequency (0.18% and 0.16%, respec-tively). Scandinavian surveys cited by Lipkin (1991) combine childhood dis-abilities with chronic diseases, and generally from 6% to 12% of children areaffected (according to the definitions used). Gortmaker and Sappenfield (1984)included psychological and neurological as well as physical disabilities in theirsurvey. Much higher estimated prevalences were found. Their listing is led by at-tention deficit disorders (15%), followed by learning disabilities (7.5%), speechand language disabilities (7%), mental retardation (2%), and moderate to severeasthma (1%). Determining the causes of these disorders is a major concern. Current thinking estimates that genetic factors contribute to many disabilities, but that the fol-lowing external factors are primary causes for many other cases and contributeto multifactor etiology in still others: intra-uterine toxins, such as alcohol, to- 43 INFANTS AND CHILDREN UP TO 14 YEARS OLD51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 43bacco, and cocaine; intra-uterine infection, such as rubella, hepatitis, and sexu- ally transmitted diseases; and asphyxia during birth. Low birthweight is associ-ated with increased risk of all the prenatal and perinatal disabilities. Postnatalcauses include toxins (such as lead poisoning), head trauma, severe infections(especially meningitis), severe malnutrition, and physical abuse. Lipkin (1991) estimates that from 3% to 15% of all developmental disabilities are acquired postnatally and that many of these are preventable. A registry of alldevelopmental disabilities in the Atlanta area (USA) for 1991 revealed thatmeningitis and child battering were the two leading causes of postnatally ac-quired disabilities in children ages 3-10 years. Injuries caused by motor vehiclesranked third. Otitis media was the primary cause of hearing impairment (CDC,1991). The Atlanta data, of course, may not apply in rural or developing re-gions, but these data can raise the index of awareness and concern about thesecauses for health professionals everywhere. Preventive efforts should focus on treating meningitis early, before brain dam- age becomes irreversible. Both bacterial infections and hemophilus influenzatype B are frequent agents. Prevention of child battering, including \"shakenbaby syndrome,\" will be covered in the section on child abuse, and vehicle in-juries will be covered in the section on unintentional injuries, both presentedlater on in this chapter. REDUCING SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME (SIDS) SIDS is of major concern in nations that have very low infant mortality rates.Where other causes for postneonatal deaths are understood and well-controlled,this residual set of sudden, unexpected and unexplained deaths baffles medicalexperts and shocks parents. This accounts, in part, for the large research expen-ditures for SIDS, despite its modest incidence by worldwide standards of infantmortality. The definition of a SIDS case has four required findings: the death is (1) sud- den, (2) unexpected, (3) occurs before the first birthday, and (4) a specific causeof death cannot be assigned despite thorough investigation, including autopsy(Smedby et al., 1993). The fourth requirement prevents present development of an international epi- demiology for SIDS. Most nations do not perform detailed autopsies on mostsudden infant deaths. Nevertheless, population studies coming from a few highlydeveloped countries with cold winter climates have identified major risk factors,as well as prevention methods that could cut SIDS deaths by more than half. 44 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 44Several different pathologic processes appear able to cause SIDS, singly or in dif- fering combinations. A breakdown in respiratory function or in temperaturecontrol, the presence of infection, and immaturity of physiologic control sys-tems have been most often implicated (Fleming, 1994). Most SIDS deathsoccur in the first 4 months of life, when the baby's self-regulating mechanismsare not adequately developed. SIDS rates have been declining in parallel with the total of other postneonatal deaths since the 1980s in countries like the United Kingdom. There are, how-ever, huge seasonal variations in cold climates. The United States, for example,incurs twice the SIDS death rates in winters compared to summers (AmericanAcademy of Pediatrics, 1996), and the same is true in Sweden. SIDS rates arerising in regions where increasing numbers of physicians are recognizing and re-porting it. Rates have also risen when traditional cultural infant care practicesare replaced with a \"Western way of living\" (Norvenius et al., 1993). Predisposing and Precipitating Risk Factors for SIDS 1. Low birthweight; 2. Maternal smoking, either during pregnancy or after birth; smoking both times triples a baby's risk. (See the section \"Preventing Postnatal Dis- abilities\" earlier in this chapter.) 3. Baby sleeps on its stomach (prone); putting babies to sleep on their back is best. 4. Sleeping on soft bedding (thick quilts, pillows, waterbeds, animal skins), anything that might reduce air intake or increase rebreathing of expired car-bon monoxide. 5. Covering the baby's head with bedding, or placing it such that bedding may fall over the baby's face later in the night. 6. Use of heavy blanketing or excess external heating; thermal physiology un- dergoes several maturational steps in the first 4 months of life, and babies canneither cool themselves enough if overheated, nor warm themselves enoughif chilled for an hour or more (Fleming, 1994; Norvenius et al., 1993). 7. Allowing the baby to become chilled for an extended period. Even a warmly covered infant breathing freezing air for an extended period can experiencerespiratory stress and SIDS. 45 INFANTS AND CHILDREN UP TO 14 YEARS OLD51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 458. Respiratory infections, either bacterial or viral, can interact with other of the above risk factors to raise risk dramatically. A low-birthweight infant in ahome with ambient smoke is more likely to die from influenza than an in-fant with influenza who is breathing clean air. Preventing SIDS Even though the pathophysiology of SIDS is poorly understood, actions to pre-vent it have proven effective. Preventive steps are much like those for respiratoryillnesses. For example, breastfeeding reduces risks here, too. Reversing the eightrisk factors just listed is clear enough to do. The issue of sleeping position warrants more discussion. Until infants are ma- ture enough to roll over\u2014from stomach to back and again to stomach\u2014theyrun the risk of having fresh airflow reduced by getting the nose and mouthblocked by pillows or soft bedding and suffocating. Older babies respond tooxygen deficit by moving enough to open airflow. Second-hand tobacco smoke,carbon monoxide, or re-breathing the baby's exhaled carbon dioxide creates hy-poxia. In addition, nicotine exposure is believed to impair a young baby's de-fense against hypoxia (Milerad and Sundall, 1993). Programs that teach parents, nurses, and childcare workers always to place the baby on its back to sleep have been followed by declines in rates of SIDS in stepwith declines in the percentage of parents putting baby to sleep on its stomach.Placing the baby on either side is almost as safe. When placing the baby on itsside, position the arm on the bed or cot in front of the baby to make it morelikely to roll toward the back than toward the stomach when it moves. (Oncethe baby can roll over both ways with ease, parents need not keep repositioningthe baby on its back, but should continue first laying it down on back or side.)Early concerns about the supine position possibly causing other problems havebeen dispelled by subsequent research, except for babies with unusual clinicalproblems. Programs like the \"Back to Sleep\" educational campaign in England, and now being conducted in the United States and elsewhere, have a catchy title and area constant reminder of the correct way to position the child. Such programshave had community success, resulting in 50% to 70% reductions in SIDS inseveral nations, including England, New Zealand, and the Netherlands. Unfor-tunately, most clinics and doctors offices do not give parents regular, organizededucation regarding how to prevent SIDS (Gibson et al., 1996), even thoughthey may be aware that the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) had adopteda preventive policy. AAP has since reaffirmed that infants should sleep on theirbacks and has endorsed other of the recommendations included here (American 46 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 46Academy of Pediatrics, 1996). Similar recommendations have come from expert consensus groups in Sweden (Smedby et al., 1993).5 INCREASING IMMUNIZATION COVERAGE PAHO/WHO's Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) targets six diseases:diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles, poliomyelitis, and tuberculosis. Somevaccines address the first two or three of these with a single injection. In 1994,the International Commission certified the eradication of poliomyelitis in theAmericas (CDC, 1994). In countries with aggressive immunization programs, diphtheria, tetanus, per- tussis, and mumps have been declining steadily from year to year, but measlesstill has its epidemic years. In countries with lower coverage, more comprehen-sive immunization programs are the most powerful way to improve children'shealth. The international goal (such as established by UNICEF) is to achieveimmunization of 80% of each community's children for all of the diseases in-cluded in EPI. Acute respiratory infections are estimated to cause one-third of all deaths in children under age 5 years in developing countries. These 4.3 million acute res-piratory deaths each year are estimated to include 480,000 due to measles,260,000 due to pertussis, and 800,000 due to neonatal pneumonia (T ullochand Richards, 1993). In addition to the deaths, millions of surviving childrenare damaged by stunted growth and diminished brain function. The vital need to expand immunization coverage against measles and pertussis is obvious from the above data. Immunization to prevent pneumonias is not af-fordable in many countries, and vaccines to prevent the most commonly occur-ring types are not yet approved. However, hepatitis B has become epidemicworldwide in children and adults. It disables by causing liver diseases, includ-ing cirrhosis and cancer\u2014and it spreads easily. Vaccines to prevent hepatitis Bare now included in the EPI-plus program, and are also being given on acommunity-wide basis in many countries. T ulloch and Richards (1993) argue that high coverage with measles vaccine is the most critical immunization to reduce both acute respiratory and diarrhealmortality in young children. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study esti-mates that measles causes the deaths of over one million children in the devel-oping world each year (1990 data) and that tetanus kills over 475,000, most of 47 INFANTS AND CHILDREN UP TO 14 YEARS OLD5An annotated bibliography on the overall topic of SIDS was presented by Fleming (1994) and more recently by Henderson-Smart and colleagues (1998).51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 47them under 5 years of age. Measles and tetanus vaccines are part of the immu- nization package used with young children. They must be promoted more ag-gressively in all areas where these infections are endemic. Rubella, a major cause of congenital anomalies, can be greatly reduced by im- munizing girls before they reach childbearing age. This can be achieved by usingthe MMR vaccine, which combines protection against measles, mumps, andrubella. Using the same vaccine with young men will provide needed coveragefor measles, prevent mumps, which can have severe effects in adults, and reducethe rubella-susceptible population to levels below the percentage needed topropagate an epidemic. The cost-benefit ratio of giving vaccines rather than allowing even a few cases of the disease to occur is well-illustrated by the cost of pertussis (whooping cough)vaccines versus the cost of caring for cases. The widespread use of pertussis vac-cine in the United States has reduced incidence of this clinical disease by 99%. Ina 1996 cost study conducted by the Texas Department of Public Health (U.S.A.),more than half of all pertussis cases and 67% of infant cases in 1994, requiredhospitalization. The median hospital charge was US$ 4,000 per case. This is 444times the cost of a $9 dose of DPT vaccine. The cost of outpatient care for thelarge number of cases not hospitalized also must go into the equation (Texas De-partment of Health, 1996). The WHO study by Bobadilla et al. (1994) estimatedthat 10% of all lost Disability Adjusted Life Years in the world's children are at-tributable to lack of immunizations. (Also see Chapters 2 and 13.) REDUCING RESPIRATORY DISEASES The incidence of acute respiratory infections in young children is rather similarin both developing and industrialized nations, with an average of four to eightepisodes per child per year (T ulloch and Richards, 1993). There are no proveneffective barriers to reduce the transmission of respiratory viruses, but there areknown measures for reducing the rate at which they precipitate serious disease. The main reason for the huge excess of child mortality due to infectious respira- tory diseases in developing versus industrialized nations is the rate at which simplecoughs and colds progress into pneumonia. While about 4% of children in indus-trialized areas develop pneumonia each year, the rate in less developed and ruralareas may run between 10% and 20% (T ulloch and Richards, 1993). In the Amer-icas the average infant mortality due to pneumonia and influenza is about 6 per1,000, with a range from 1.5 per 1,000 in Canada to more than 20 in Haiti, Bo-livia, and Peru (PAHO, 1994). Worldwide, respiratory infections account for about20% of all deaths from birth up to age 5. In the developing world respiratory in-fections are the leading cause of loss of healthy life years (DALYs) among children,accounting for about 15% of the total burden experienced. 48 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 48The death rates for pneumonia and influenza are much lower and continue to decline steadily for children ages 1-4 years old. Again, rates correlate closely withindicators of poverty, housing conditions, and food accessibility, from 1 per100,000 in Canada and the United States to 224 per 100,000 in Guatemala. The key to cutting the death rate is to prevent or promptly treat childhood pneumonias. Risk factors include low birthweight, malnutrition, indoor air pol-lution, and allowing infants to become chilled. There is suggestive evidence thatvitamin A reduces the severity of some respiratory infections in places wherediets are only marginally adequate. Pneumonias are most often viral in indus-trialized areas, but most often bacterial in developing areas, thus making selec-tive use of antibiotics the treatment of choice. PAHO warns, however, thatexcessive use of antibiotics, as practiced in some places, actually aggravates theclinical condition of many children. WHO has developed standardized case man-agement for childhood respiratory infections. Universal extended breastfeeding of babies increases immunity to many respira- tory diseases, as well as providing more calories and proteins than early-weanedchildren typically receive. Particularly important is that breast milk stimulatesimmunity to most of the pathogens endemic in the mother's and child's envi-ronment. A case-control study in Brazil showed that babies who had not beenbreast-fed had 3.6 times the risk of dying from respiratory infection than babieswho had been exclusively breast-fed (Victoria et al., 1987). The mortality ben-efit of breastfeeding in environments where infant mortality is already low is rel-atively less. Adequate nutrition and protection against other diseases (e.g., dis-eases preventable by immunization and diarrheas) raises the host resistance ofchildren of all ages against the worsening of acute respiratory infections. Indoor air pollution caused either by burning smoky fuels or cigarette smoking without adequate ventilation is another correctable risk factor for respiratorydisease in young children. The presence of a smoker in the household raises riskof respiratory infections in young children. In the United States alone between150,000 to 300,000 cases of bronchitis andpneumonia in children are attributed tosecond-hand tobacco smoke in the homeeach year (United States Environmental Pro-tection Agency, 1993). Tobacco smoke has more lethal effects in infants, where maternal smoking doublesthe rate of sudden infant death syndrome(SIDS). The combination of maternal cigarette smoking both during pregnancyand during infancy tripled the rate of SIDS in a large representative United Statessample of infants (Schoendorf and Kiely, 1992). 49 INFANTS AND CHILDREN UP TO 14 YEARS OLDUniversal extended breastfeeding of babies increases immunity to many respiratory diseases, as well asproviding more calories and proteinsthan early-weaned children typicallyreceive.51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 49CONTROLLING DIARRHEAL DISEASES Worldwide, it is estimated that at least 12,600 children die each day with diar- rheal diseases (Guerrant, 1992). Of this total 4.6 to 6 million deaths per year,about 3.2 million occur in developing nations. Globally, on an average, childrenexperience 2 to 11 diarrheal episodes per year. Children in the United Statesexperience about two episodes per year, the same as children in affluent homes in tropical countries (Guerrant, 1992). However, among children attending day care centers the attack rate is higher. In contrast, in some impoverished areas the diarrhea attack rate averages 15-19 diarrheal episodes per child per year. In northeast Brazil, one of several examples, more infants and children diefrom diarrhea than all other causes combined (Guerrant and McAuliffe, 1986, pp. 287-307). In addition to high worldwide mortality, prolonged diarrheal dis-ease can lead to serious malnutrition and stunting of growth, both of which, inturn, raise the frequency and duration of future diarrhea episodes and lower re-sistance to other kinds of disease. Between 1965 and 1990 mortality rates havebeen reduced dramatically (PAHO, 1994). This is probably the joint result of im-proved sanitation and increased usage of oral rehydration therapy, but there is stilla long way to go in many places even in the twenty-first century. In addition to mortality, diarrheal diseases account for about 14% of the bur- den of disease (a combination of early death and living with impairment)among children of the developing world (Bobadilla et al., 1994). The WHO classification system for field use identifies three presentations of di- arrheal disease: (a) acute watery diarrhea (lasting less than 14 days), (b) dysen-tery (with blood in the stool), and (c) persistent diarrhea (lasting more than 14days without blood). The key to reducing mortality or extended damage from diarrhea is to prevent acute episodes from becoming persistent, involving blood loss, or causing de-hydration. Feeding oral rehydrating salt solutions continuously in repeatedsmall doses is the main defense against dehydration. The development in 1978of this ingenious \"low tech\" therapy saves about one million lives each year(Hirschhorn and Greenough, 1991). Wider usage would save even more lives. Persistent diarrhea cases have a case fatality ratio 5.6 times that of acute cases, and dysentery cases have a fatality ratio 2.4 times the acute cases (T ulloch andRichard, 1993). The keys to reducing incidence of all forms of diarrheal diseaseare: (1) personal hygiene, especially with regard to fecal contamination; (2) pro-vision of pure food and water; and (3) extended breastfeeding to build immu-nity. In a case-control study in Brazil, infants not receiving breast milk had 14.2times the risk of dying from diarrhea, compared to infants fed breast milk ex-clusively (Victoria et al., 1987). 50 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 50Preventive tasks are twofold\u2014primary, to reduce the incidence of diarrheal episodes and secondary, to keep acute cases from becoming more serious. Bothefforts depend almost entirely on changing human behavior\u2014in the short-term, directed to parents, child-care workers, and health professionals; in thelong-term, to policy makers and administrators to install pure water, food hy-giene, and sewage systems. Political apathy by decision-makers, whose familiesare not affected by these epidemics, helps block the infrastructure investmentsneeded to resolve these worldwide problems (Thielman and Guerrant, 1996). The preventive interventions listed below all involve changing knowledge, priorities,and behaviors. Some may not be feasible incertain areas, depending on the climate, culture, infrastructure, and economy;other interventions may become feasible after appropriate training of healthpersonnel. A useful guide to achieving the needed behavior changes in povertyconditions was presented by C.M. Monte and colleagues (1997). Primary Prevention 1. Teach personal hygiene, especially hand washing always before handling food, always after defecation, and always after cleaning one child's defecationand before touching the next child. Use sufficient toilet paper to reduce con-tamination of hands. Wash children's hands often, too. 2. Provide for sanitary disposal of feces, through plumbing and sewage, through disposal of diapers in fly-proof containers, and through latrines or buryingunderground when in the field. 3. Encourage breastfeeding throughout infancy. Breast milk is nutritious, safe, uncontaminated and provides antibody protection. It may be necessary tomodify existing employment policies in order to encourage working moth-ers of young infants to breast feed at work or to store breast milk in sanitarybottles so that babies can be fed while mother is away. 4. Purify drinking water, either at the community or household level. This de- pends upon changing the knowledge, priorities, and behaviors of politicaldecision-makers and economic resource-providers. 5. Pasteurize or boil all dairy products. 6. Practice careful comprehensive cleanliness in food preparation at home, at day-care centers, and at commercial food preparation facilities. Keep coldfoods cold and hot foods hot, if at all possible. 51 INFANTS AND CHILDREN UP TO 14 YEARS OLDAt least 12,600 children die each day from diarrheal diseases.51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 517. If foods must be prepared several hours (or days) before serving a large group, they should be rapidly chilled to below 4\u00b0C. Reheating foods that area good medium for bacterial growth to 75\u00b0C or more will destroy somepathogens (e.g., Salmonella spp., Clostridium perfringens , Staphylococcus au- reus) but not some of their toxins (Werner, 1986). Not all of these precau- tions can be followed in family homes, but institutions serving large num-bers of people should follow them. Secondary Prevention 1. Maintain good nutrition to minimize the impact of diarrheal episodes. 2. Prevent dehydration and malnutrition by continuing to feed fluids and ap- propriate bland foods. 3. Use oral rehydration salts with plenty of fluid to maintain electrolyte balance.4. Refer for medical care if diarrhea persists more than 14 days or stools con- tain blood. Oral Rehydration\u2014How to Do It The members of every social group in the world, whether they be residents of arural island or an enclave of migrants in a major metropolis, have their own tra-ditional definitions of each common disease and symptom complex, its possiblecauses, and how it should be treated. Western medicine enters the scene and over-laps its own diagnostic and treatment principles upon the folkways of local citi-zens. The first concern of health workers should be to transplant the new healthmeasure\u2014in this instance oral rehydration therapy (ORT) as the first response todiarrhea\u2014so that it will not be rejected by the rest of the body of local beliefs andfears, so that people will \"stick to it.\" Just as you cannot make an adhesive band-age stick to wet skin, you must prepare the \"surface\" before introducing a newhealth measure. So also with any medical innovation. (See also Coreil and Mull(eds.), 1998) for an anthropological review of diarrheal control strategies. (Also see the discussion of strategies for behavior change in Chapter 7.) Teaching points to convey to mothers in the target population: Using local terminology, explain that ORT should be used for every form of diarrhea, whatever its cause. ORT may not stop the diarrhea quickly, but it will prevent dehydration\u2014translatable as drying out, wasting away, losing strength. ORT will put lifefluids, energy, resistance, and \"refreshment\" into the body. 52 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 52ORT involves work: feeding teaspoonfuls of ORT solution, minute by min- ute, for hours (feeding too rapidly may encourage vomiting). Yet it is the bestthing anybody can do for the child. There are fewer errors in mixing ORT solution if pre-mixed packets of thedry ingredients are available for distribution. The most common error is fail-ure to add enough water. Much of the pre-packaged ORT includes: sodiumchloride, 3.5 chloride, 1.5 g; glucose,20 g. This is to be dissolved in 1 liter of drinking water. The UNICEF pack-age for 1 liter of ORT contains: sodium sodium bicarbonate,2.5 g; potassium chloride, g; and anhydrous glucose, 20 g. These are ro-bust formulas and modest deviations do not reduce efficacy, but these may bemore expensive than homemade, unless packets can be given free. It is not necessary to boil water before making the \"drink,\" but if the motherwishes to boil it, this should be done before the salts and sugar are added.Serve at \"room temperature\"\u2014neither hot nor chilled. PAHO (1994) reviewed data for 33 countries and found that while 70% of the people in these populations had access to ORT, only 55% of children in needreceived ORT properly. A comprehensive review of this topic has been preparedby Huttly, Morris, and Pisani (1997; 111 references). REDUCING RATES OF UNINTENTIONAL INJURIES Unintentional injury is the term now used by public health workers to encompasswhat were formerly called \"accidents.\" This is because the epidemiologic study ofsuch events shows that injuries are not random events (as are \"true accidents\"), buthave the same kind of predictability and identifiable personal and environmentalrisk factors as do diseases. They are also subject to reduction by appropriate inter-ventions. According to the World Bank, injuries and violence accounted for 15%of years of productive life lost (before age 65) in the world. For the Americas thedata are similar (PAHO, 1994, 1998, 2002). Rates are more than twice as greatin males compared to females. There is a peak in mortality from this cause dur-ing the first year of life, followed by a decline until age 14. From age 15 to aboutage 30, a true pandemic of deaths and injuries develops. Many volumes have been published about this area of public health, and the section that follows is merely an introduction, a source of references, and a rec-ommendation for several high-priority interventions. Injury is caused by the impact upon a living organism (in this section, upon young children) by a source of energy\u2014such as blunt or sharp physical impact,moving objects (vehicles, one's own body in falls, bullets), heat, radiation, ortoxins (damaging substances or chemicals inhaled, swallowed, or touched). A 53 INFANTS AND CHILDREN UP TO 14 YEARS OLD51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 53harmful transfer of energy is always the cause of an acute injury. The most ef- fective preventive interventions for unintentional injuries are environmentalchanges, rather than trying to change human behaviors. This is especially truefor children. Of course, changing the environment (whether micro or macro)for children means changing the behaviors, expectations, and vigilance of par-ents, health professionals, and everyone in the community. Injuries and adverse effects (including poisoning, burns, etc.) rate as high as the seventh leading cause of infant death in the United States and similar industri-alized countries. Both the death rates and burden of injury disabilities are evenhigher in less developed countries. In the latter countries, injuries are typicallythe leading cause of deaths in males from ages 5 to 44 years and in females fromages 5-24 years, after which circulatory and neoplastic diseases become theleading causes. In these countries, the leading causes of death for children ages1 to 4 years are infectious and parasitic damage to the respiratory and intestinalsystems. In more industrialized nations, such as Argentina, Uruguay, Spain, Austria, Poland, and the United States of America, injuries are the leading cause of deathall the way from ages 1 to 34 years in males and from ages 1 to 24 years in females. When indexes suchas years of productive life lost(YPLL) or burden of disabilityare calculated, injuries becomethe leading cause for the entirepopulation in most countries.Reducing injuries, be they in- tentional or nonintentional (as discussed in the following section), must be-come a top priority both for child health care professionals and for public healthprofessionals. Clearly, prevention is preferable to cure, because in many cases ofinjury full recovery is not possible. In addition to the toll they take in mortality and disability, injuries have major economic and social consequences for the families and communities in whichthey occur, including costs of outpatient and hospital treatment, absence fromwork (in adults), disability, lost productivity, costs of home care, and lost daysfrom school (in children). A Swedish study of road accidents (Hartunian et al.,1980) showed that 30% of the total calculated cost for injuries was for medicalcare, whereas 70% was attributed to lost productivity. This ratio can probablybe generalized to other types of injuries and other nations. It should be kept inmind that these costs are only short-term estimates. A severely injured child mayexperience a full lifetime of increased dependency and reduced work skills.Damage to the brain and nervous system can raise risks both for conduct dis-orders during youth and Alzheimer's disease in old age (Mrazek and Haggerty,1994). (Also see Chapter 11.) 54 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHBeyond the toll they take in death and disability, injuries exact major economic and social consequences for families and communities.51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 54These are the three major determinants of whether injuries occur to children and what kind they may be: (1) the developmental age and skills of the child,(2) the dangers and protections in the child's immediate environment, and (3) the adequacy of adult supervision. Children ages 1 to 4 years suffer more injuries than infants under 1 year old be- cause they are more mobile\u2014they can run and climb. Their curiosity is high;self-restraint, low; and they have inadequate experience and ability to link theiractions with sometimes painful results. At ages 1 to 4, children also have moreinjuries than those 5 years old and older, because the latter group, although evenmore mobile, has learned much about household dangers, has learned to linkcause and effects, and usually shows more self-restraint. The most common dan-gers for children aged 1-4 are burns, scalds, falls, poisons, lack of parental pro-vision of car safety seats and restraints, and lack of smoke detectors in homes.By age 5, a higher proportion of injuries involve motor vehicles, both as pas-sengers and while crossing streets or running from play areas into streets. Par-ents often expect or allow children to attempt to do unsupervised things that arebeyond their developmental stage, with injuries too frequent a result. Boys experience 150% to 250% the rate of injuries compared to girls at every age. Overactivity and aggressiveness are behavioral contributors to risk. Livingin poverty is another major risk factor around the world. In Western countries,the following risk factors have also been repeatedly documented: children infamilies with three or more young children, single parent families, mother suf-fering from depression, mother is a teenager, and child has a history of injuries.Despite the validity of these predictors, intervention programs targeted at chil-dren having multiple risk factors have not, in general, been proven effective inactually reducing trauma rates (Kendrick, 1994). Injury research across the full lifespan indicates that passive preventive measures (those not calling for continuing vigilance or repeated behaviors) are much moreeffective than those attempting to change repertoires of behavior. Supplyingmedicines or household chemicals with \"child-proof\" closures is an example ofa passive prevention that has proven remarkably effective. Automatic seat beltsfor adults in automobiles, \"speed-bumps\" on side streets, and placing windowlatches that prevent a home window from opening far enough to allow a smallchild to crawl through are further examples of passive prevention measures. Legislation and regulations are other effective means of prevention, providing they are enforced. Laws that mandate the use of automobile seat belts and mo-torcycle helmet laws and that impose heavy penalties for noncompliance\u2014irre-spective of whether an \"accident\" or other infraction occurs\u2014have been oftenshown to save lives far beyond their cost. Laws mandating the use of approvedchild safety seats for all children under a specified age, coupled with systems forloaning seats to families who cannot afford them and education of parents and 55 INFANTS AND CHILDREN UP TO 14 YEARS OLD51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 55health professionals, have been shown to cut drastically the number and sever- ity of injuries of young children in motor vehicles. The third most effective approach\u2014and one that is essential to support envi- ronmental change and legal requirements\u2014is to pursue the sort of educationthat changes behavior, be it of parents, more mature children, health profes-sionals, or community leaders (in government, school, industries, churches, andcivic organizations). (A more complete discussion of how this can be ac- complished is found in Chapter 11.) Many careful studies have shown that health professionals working in primary care can be effective agents for change in reducing children's injury ratesthrough counseling, facilitating small scale environmental changes in andaround homes, and lobbying for \"child-safe communities\" with local and pro-vincial authorities (see Bass et al., 1993; Kendrick, 1994; and Grossman andRivara, 1992, for documentation). Several authors cited offer lists of interven-tions which can reduce rates of childhood injuries. The collective summary pre-sented below is organized by the external force causing the injury. Preventing Impact Injuries to Children Inside Motor Vehicles Provide child safety seats correctly anchored by seat belts where this is eco- nomically feasible. In those states or provinces where there are laws requiringthis, they should be obeyed. After children outgrow safety seats, keep them properly safety-belted any timethe car is moving, preferably in the back seat. Do not allow children to ride in the back of open trucks (e.g., pickup orflatbed), unless slow speeds and great caution are used. In those states orprovinces that have laws forbidding such riding, these should be obeyed andenforced. (Also see Chapter 11 for further steps to reduce motor vehi- cle injuries at all ages.) Preventing Impact Injuries to Children Outside of Motor Vehicles Children playing near streets or crossing streets should be supervised accord- ing to their age and the nature of traffic. Preschoolers might be allowed toplay in unpaved streets that are free of all \"through-traffic\" and used only bya few responsible neighbors. Even older children will need supervision cross-ing highways with fast traffic, however. Parents and anyone caring for chil-dren should always use those extra ounces of caution and prevention. 56 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 56Yards where children play near home or school should be fenced if they are near streets and roads. This keeps balls and toys from rolling into the street,tempting children to run after them. Many young children like to play or hide around or behind cars and manyhave been killed by a family member backing up a vehicle over them. Alldrivers should always check both under and behind their vehicle (while walk-ing outside it) before putting it in motion. Preventing Impact Injuries to Children on Playground Equipment or Climbing Many impact injuries involve falls out of trees, off porches, or from swings and slides. Adults and adolescents caring for young children should not letthem experiment with doing things for which they are not ready develop-mentally. Often, letting a child try something new (such as a playgroundslide), while keeping a protective hand nearby, will allow an appropriate fear of that activity to develop until such time as the child grows further.There are also injuries associated with organized games and sports, which can be reduced by proper equipment, coaching, and a playing surface that isuser-friendly. Preventing Injuries on Household Stairs and Windows Put \"stops\" on windows that are more than about 1.5 m (5 feet) above theground, so that they will not open wide enough to allow a child's head or hipsto fall through. Install folding gates or barricade the tops of stairwells with furniture to pre-vent young children from falling down. Even after they have learned to crawlup and down stairs, a running child can slip or misjudge the distance andtumble off the top steps. There will be many more impacts before that fallstops. Preventing Burn Injuries Young children are particularly at risk to burns, scalds, and electrical shocks.Adults are so conditioned to avoiding these hazards that they forget safety hasto be learned, it is not instinctive. Aside from the very old, young children areat highest risk of death due to fire, flames, and smoke. In climates and communities where homes catch fire, smoke detectors shouldbe installed and regularly checked in dwellings with bedrooms without an 57 INFANTS AND CHILDREN UP TO 14 YEARS OLD51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 57easy exit to the outside. Even where such access is available, smoke detectors will awaken heavy sleepers so they and their families can escape in time. Atleast as many people die from silent smoke as from crackling flames\u2014andsmoke spreads more quickly. Properly working smoke detectors cut the rateof children dying in fires by half. Children should be kept well away from indoor heaters and stoves with hotsurfaces. Acquire models that have protective screens or improvise barriersfrom materials that won't scorch or burn. other clothing should have snug sleevesand should be belted around the waist so they have less chance of coming incontact with heaters and igniting. Some countries require that young chil-dren's clothing be made from flame-resistant fabrics. In other nations thissource of burn injury is too rare to justify a legal program, but might be in-cluded as part of parent education. Matches and lighters should be in places that children cannot reach. Don'tallow children to play with anything that can cause a fire. Keep hot cooking pots and their handles out of reach of children. Many chil-dren receive second- and third-degree burns each year because they grab a pothandle atop the stove and spill boiling liquids on themselves. Homes with automatic hot water heaters should have the thermostat set tono more than 130\u00b0 F (54\u00b0 C). Most manufacturers set thermostats at 140\u00b0 Fto 150\u00b0 F (60\u00b0 to 65\u00b0 C), hot enough to cause severe second-degree burns onadult skin in two seconds. Lower settings will prevent people of all ages fromaccidentally scalding themselves seriously. Hot tap water accounted for 24%of the scald burns requiring hospitalization in children under age 4 in aUnited States study. Some states have laws requiring that all new waterheaters be set no higher than 130\u00b0 F (54\u00b0 C) (Grossman and Rivara, 1992).This paragraph would not apply to those perennially warm climates wherewater heaters are uncommon. The same cautions, however, must be heededwhen using stove- or fire-heated water near children. Parents heating water for baths or washing should test the water temperaturesby submerging tender skin (a wrist or cheek) in the water for five seconds be-fore placing the baby or child in the water. Accidental scald injuries have ir-regular, splash-like borders, and tend to be less serious than intentionally in-flicted scalds (Botash et al., 1996). Fireworks are another common source of burns. Children should never set offexplosive firecrackers. Many children have lost fingers and eyes or have beenleft with permanently disfigured faces from malfunctioning fireworks. Chil- 58 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 58dren may also run over and touch firework fragments or wires on \"sparklers\" while they are still hot enough to burn. Chemical burns from hot sulphur orphosphorus cause extended pain. Old electrical appliances and electric cords that are frayed or have cracked in-sulation can cause serious shocks and burns, including house fires. In somecircumstances, these may be fatal. Overloading electrical circuits by havingtoo many appliances connected to the same outlet can also cause shocks,sparks, and fires. The visiting nurse or health assistant can look for these haz-ards as well as many others listed in this chapter when they make home visits. Children go through a stage of exploring their surroundings. Some will stickpins, keys, or other metal objects into electrical outlets, resulting in hazardouselectrical shocks. Unfilled electrical outlets in children's rooms should be cov-ered with adhesive tape or plastic covers until the child grows out of this stage. Preventing Poisoning In their first year of life, children automatically and unconsciously put everythingin their mouths; this, coupled with children's ability to walk and handle thingsin their second year, and the curiosity to open containers, adds up to a higherrisk of poisoning in the ages from 1 to 5 years, than at any other time of life. The most effective measure to reduce childhood poisonings has been legislation requiring childproof packaging of the most common, potentially dangerous sub-stances (prescription medications, as well as over-the-counter pain killers includ-ing aspirin and vitamins, especially if pleasantly flavored ). Other compounds arenot protectively packaged, however, and cause thousands of poisonings. Theseinclude detergents, polishes, drain cleaners, kerosene, solvents used by painters,and farm chemicals such as pesticides, fertilizers, and chemically-treated seeds.Children should be kept away from these poisons by changing the microen-vironment: poisons should be stored on high shelves or in cabinets or closets that have a complex latch that younger chil-dren cannot manipulate, and all medica-tions should be kept in containers that chil-dren cannot open. Parents cannot watchchildren closely all the time, and warnings or scolding is usually forgotten bychildren or lost in the excitement of finding new things to do. Clearly, a passiveprevention approach will work best. Children from ages 2 to 5 years are at highest risk of lead poisoning. This heavy metal, once ingested, is stored in the body, causing varying degrees of damageto the brain, nervous system, heart, kidneys, and other internal organs; de-pending on the dose, damage may be permanent. While there are various envi- 59 INFANTS AND CHILDREN UP TO 14 YEARS OLDChildren from ages 2 to 5 years are at highest risk of lead poisoning.51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 59ronmental sources of lead, the one that causes the most serious and acute dam- age is paint containing lead. Leaded paint was more frequently used before the1950s. It was primarily used to paint the outside of houses and often also wasused on inside wood surfaces. Any factories nearby which process lead, as wellas the use of lead-glazed dishes, are other sources of this toxin. Some young chil-dren develop a habit of habitually eating non-food substances such as dry peel-ing paint, plaster, dirt, cloth, paper, or special kinds of clay. (This habit has beencalled \"pica,\" after magpie birds who reputedly eat all kinds of junk.) Some chil-dren also dip their fingers in stove oil, leaded gasoline, or kerosene and then lickthem. One can see how many kinds of poisoning might occur this way. Leadcompounds apparently taste sweet to most children, so their habit is not ran-dom or due to boredom, but motivated, focused, and self-reinforced. Therefore, parents should be taught to look for the habit of pica, to separate their children from their favorite substances, and report the situation promptlyto a health professional. A child with pica will usually limit himself to two orthree favorite substances. If these include lead-containing paints, painted plas-ter, or dirt near the house on which paint was spilled or dropped in flakes by apaint removal process, the child may, after repeated small ingestions, developlead poisoning. Early signs of lead poisoning in children include behavioral changes, such as be- coming more irritable, crying easily, becoming more easily frightened, movingmore sluggishly, having neurologic symptoms, experiencing stomach pains, andfighting with and sometimes biting playmates. In latitudes with climate change,symptoms usually worsen in hot summer. Health professionals, when confronted with symptoms like these, should always obtain a blood lead determination. Some urban areas with old housing performblood lead screening on all children ages 1 to 5 years, and find enough subclin-ical cases to initiate early treatment and to justify primary prevention for otherchildren in those areas. Preventing Cuts and Lacerations Although very frequent, these injuries are usually relatively mild; that is, unlessthey are intentionally inflicted. The usual causes include knives, tools, brokenglass or metal pieces, and farm implements. The parent's task is to keep the childseparated from such objects, until his or her developmental level (irrespective ofactual age) is adequate in knowledge, self-control, and appreciation of risk toallow safe handling. Health visitors' checklists should keep them alert for suchitems in children's reach. Windows and glass doors should be shielded from ac-cidental breakage and children should be prevented from cutting themselves byrunning into these surfaces or throwing objects that might shatter them. 60 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 60Preventing Drownings Drowning is a surprisingly frequent cause of death among boys ages 1 to 4 years, accounting for about 20% to 30% of \"external cause\" fatalities in some coun-tries, and more where the population is dense around rivers, lakes, and beaches.(Drowning again becomes a major proportional cause of death for young men15-24 years old.) To protect young children from drowning, they should be kept away from even shallow bodies of water unless closely supervised by a skilled swimmer. Yardsshould be fenced to keep children within and away from streams and ponds.Yards with swimming pools should be fenced to keep children out unless su-pervised. Few adults realize that small children can drown in very shallow water:infants can drown in bathtubs and toddlers, in shallow streams, if they fall downthe banks and are unable to move out of a face down position. Environmentalbarriers and unbroken parental alertness are key factors in preventing drowning. When children become developmentally ready, teaching them to swim and to float\u2014to manage in deeper water without fear, but with healthy respect\u2014isanother well-proven preventive from drowning. Dealing with Insect and Animal Bites In tropical climates insect bites can transmit such damaging diseases as malaria, yel-low fever, river blindness, and Chagas' disease. In addition, many people, includingchildren, have allergies to insect bites, which can precipitate shock or even death ifnot treated. Ideally, doors, windows, and other openings should be screened. If thisis not affordable, it is essential to use insect netting on beds and hammocks. Care-ful use of insecticide sprays in homes also is effective, but this can only be donesafely by a trained person. For especially susceptible children, insect repellents maybe used during waking hours when mosquitoes and other vectors are most evident. Animal bites are less frequent but more serious in areas where cats and dogs are not immunized against rabies. Children should be cautioned repeatedly never tochase or touch strange animals and not to threaten or hurt household pets. Again,a fence around play areas will keep pets and children in and other animals out. Everyone should avoid animals that are acting strangely, that appear in a rage, or those that have lost muscle coordination\u2014they may have caught rabies fromanother animal. Natural reservoirs for rabies include wild foxes, wolves, coyotes,raccoons, bats, and skunks. In developing countries, dogs are the principalreservoir. Although rabies is mainly a disease of animals, it can be spread to hu-mans by bites or animal saliva. When rabies is not treated promptly with thecorrect injections, it is usually fatal to humans. 61 INFANTS AND CHILDREN UP TO 14 YEARS OLD51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 61Other less severe diseases can also be caused by animal bites or saliva. Preventive measures are the same as described above, primarily separating children fromunfamiliar animals. First aid involves washing the wounds immediately withsoap and water, enclosing the animal (or killing it, if wild) for laboratory exam-ination, and taking the bitten person to a health professional for examinationand treatment (Chin (ed.), 2000). Preventing Strangulation/Choking Choking in young children usually occurs in one of three ways: by children putting small hard objects, such as balls and toy parts, in theirmouths and letting them fall back into their throats; by ingesting pieces of food that are too large to swallow unless the food isthoroughly chewed\u2014remember that young children tend to gulp; by putting very young children into cribs, playpens, or other enclosures orporches where the bars or posts that form the sides are far enough apart forthe child to wedge his head through. The child may then turn or twistenough to be unable to retract the head through the openings, and in the en-suing panic cut off air flow through the neck. The extent of choking/strangulation as a cause of death is great; in recent years it accounted for 16% of all injury mortality under age 5 years in a large U.S. state. Such injuries can be largely prevented by educating parents to modify the child's microenvironment in selection of cribs, playpens, and toys, and to cut solidfoods very small before feeding. Some states or countries require labeling oftoys, telling of any danger to any age groups. Preventing Suffocation Like strangulation and choking, suffocation causes death by anoxia, but it doesnot involve compression of the neck or blockage of the trachea. Suffocation oc-curs when properly oxygenated air is no longer available to a person. This canoccur when a closed room or automobile accumulates an excess of carbon diox-ide or monoxide from heaters or engines which burn up the oxygen. It alsooften occurs when young children play with plastic bags, plastic sheeting, orrubber balloons in such a way as to block their nose or mouth. In infants, re-duction of air intake, such as may be caused by resting face down on thick blan-kets or comforters, may precipitate sudden infant death syndrome. 62 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 62Large airtight containers, such as discarded refrigerators, freezers, or storage trunks, are attractive playthings for children. Every year some get caught insideand suffocate before they can escape. Many communities have laws requiringthat the doors (or lids) of all such containers be removed before they are dis-carded or left unattended. This should become a universal safety practice. Preventing Firearm Injuries The epidemic of gun-related injuries and deaths really begins at about age 15 inmales; there is no such epidemic in females. Review of cause-specific mortalityrates across 10 countries (8 in the Americas) shows male-to-female homiciderate ratios for ages 15 to 54 ranging from 3 to 1 to 15 to 1. In the United Statesit is estimated that there are at least five nonfatal shootings for each fatal one.Hospital and police costs also are tremendous. A report to the United StatesCongress in 1989 estimated that the average total cost for each firearm fatality(homicides, suicides, and unintentional injuries) was $373,000. Nonfatal in-juries cost much less, as does the financial impact per case in other nations. You may wonder why we have included this in a section on pediatrics. Unfor- tunately, guns are increasingly reaching down to younger ages to reap their vic-tims. In 1990, in a large United States state, 16% of total injury mortality inchildren under age 5 years was attributed to homicide and an additional num-ber to unintentional firearms injuries. For children ages 5 to 9 years, the totaltrauma mortality included 5% due to \"accidental\" firearm injuries and 7% ofdeaths due to homicides, most of which were caused by firearms. Still, in the pediatric age range\u2014ages 10-14\u2014this large state with a good mix of urban, suburban, small town, rural agriculture, and industrial areas, attrib-uted 9% of injury mortality to unintentional firearm discharge, 13% to suicide,and 16% to homicide due to guns. That totals 38% of all traumatic fatalities,equal to the total caused by motor vehicles in this age group and location. The rates of violent death vary greatly from country to country, and the pro- portion due to firearms differs by the number of handguns available to the gen-eral public. Nations with more restrictive policies and laws concerning hand-guns have fewer gunshot injuries and deaths due to suicides, homicides, andunintentional \"accidents.\" Preventive measures include keeping guns out of the home and teaching chil- dren not to play with others who have personal access to guns. If guns are keptin the household, they should be kept in locked cabinets\u2014cabinets that even14-year-olds cannot open\u2014and they should be kept unloaded with ammuni-tion stored in a separate locked place. It should be noted that long-barreled guns 63 INFANTS AND CHILDREN UP TO 14 YEARS OLD51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 63(rifles or shotguns) are involved in proportionally fewer unintentional injuries, suicides, and homicides than are smaller handguns. Teaching the dangers ofguns, how to handle them safely, and why never to get near them when emo-tionally upset, may be valuable, if the lessons are internalized. Here again, envi-ronmental change is more powerful than teaching safe behaviors, because strongimpulses can melt away past learning at least for short intervals. The extra fewminutes it takes to unlock both guns and ammunition may allow enough cool-ing off to prevent disaster. CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT Child abuse and neglect are part of the larger problem of violence in modernsociety. At least 150,000 children aged 0-4 years are intentionally killed eachyear worldwide (Murray and Lopez, 1996, p. 468). (Because persons of any agecan be the victims of violence, this topic will be addressed at each stage of thelife cycle. At all stages the victims suffer physical and/or psychological and/or so-cial trauma and require the services of health agencies and possibly other sectorsof community services as well.) Abuse and neglect can create physical and emo-tional damage that will express itself again in future years. Preventing abuse andneglect not only saves lives and prevents disabilities, it also is a vital part of pro-moting future mental health and social adaptation. Child abuse and neglect are either becoming more severe and more prevalent in most nations or they are becoming more often recognized and classified as \"non-accidental.\" Creighton (1988) estimates that the incidence of physical abuse ofchildren increased by 70% in the United Kingdom between 1970 and 1986.Whatever the reason, the rates of intentional injury and related mortality inchildren have risen to the point where national and international health au-thorities have ranked abuse and neglect as major public health problems. Thisis because psychosocial pathology causes abuse, violence is transmitted like anepidemic, and the resulting damage endures for years and places great demandson health professionals, emergency care facilities, rehabilitation services, andmental health treatment. Abuse\u2014whether of children, adolescents, partners, or the elderly\u2014can take place in a wide variety of forms: physical trauma, psychosocial damage (such asthreats of injury or death, a constant barrage of insulting or belittling accusa-tions, loss of trust in everyone, exposure to unpredictable uncontrolled rage,being isolated or abandoned), and sexual abuse (both actions and threats). Neglect also can take several forms: failure to provide the necessities for life and normal development, such as food, clothing, shelter, communication, self-acceptance, and encouragement of learning, and failure to protect from envi- 64 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 64ronmental and household hazards, excessive cold or heat, and social or sexual exploitation. Child abuse and/or neglect includes any act of omission or com-mission that endangers or impairs a child's physical or emotional health and de-velopment (Kerfoot, 1992). Prevalence and Severity of the Problem Relatively few nations systematically collect child abuse data, and for those thatdo, reports often underestimate the true incidence of this problem. The Amer-ican Association for Protecting Children reported an abuse rate of 34 per 1,000children in the United States for 1987 (cited in MacMillan et al., 1993). An-other national household survey reported about 10% of parents admitted atleast one \"severe violent act\" against a child in the previous year (Straus andGelles, 1986). The severity and long-term impact of child abuse is also generally underesti- mated. Homicide is the leading cause of injury-related deaths in infants in somenations. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) physical abuseis the leading single cause of head injury in infants (under age 1 year) (AmericanAcademy of Pediatrics, 1993). Many in-tracranial injuries in infants and youngchildren show no fractures or surface bruises,but rather subdural, subarachnoid, or reti-nal hemorrhages and a cluster clinicalneurological signs and symptoms. Thisclinical presentation includes \"shaken babysyndrome.\" The cited report reviews theradiology, pathological findings, and long-term disability from such injuries. Ina United States case series, 80% of deaths from head trauma in children under2 years of age were intentionally inflicted. Often the only visible signs of lesssevere shaking of the baby are intraocular hemorrhages and clinical indicators ofpossible cerebral edema, neurologic signs, or light coma. In a series of infants who were comatose when initially examined, 60% either died or suffered continuing profound disabilities. Most cases present with lesssevere findings, mimicking more common disorders; as a result, they are notcorrectly diagnosed at first (American Academy of Pediatrics, 1993). As seen in the section \"Preventing Postnatal Disabilities,\" earlier in this chapter, in a major metropolitan area, the second leading cause of child disabilities orig-inating after birth is beating of children. 65 INFANTS AND CHILDREN UP TO 14 YEARS OLDAbuse and neglect can create physical and emotional damage that willexpress itself again in future years.Preventing abuse and neglect not onlysaves lives and prevents disabilities, italso is a vital part of promoting futuremental health and social adaptation.51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 65Cross-cultural Considerations Rates of child abuse in less industrialized nations than the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States are mostly unknown. In many traditional agrariancultures, children are perceived somewhat more as their family's property, andraising and disciplining them is considered a private family matter. Actions con-sidered abusive in some nations are considered acceptable in others. This is chang-ing in many places, as Western industrialized cultural norms and values spread. An important consideration to be weighed into each community's position on injuries from abuse, is the extent to which the entire community recognizesboth the short- and long-term costs of current child abuse and neglect. Costsfor the community include the death of some children and the permanent dis-ability of many others that may emerge as crippling brain damage, psychiatricdisorders, the spread of violence around the neighborhood when the abused orneglected children reach adolescence, and the transmission of violence to thenext generation when the children become parents. Being a victim of repeated childhood maltreatment or experiencing physical or sexual assault, confers a heavy risk for psychiatric disorders later in life, includ-ing depression (Mrazek and Haggerty, 1994, p. 165). A review of prevention ofmental disorders commissioned by the United States government, also reports adoubled rate of juvenile delinquency in youth who in their younger years wereabused or neglected, compared to a control group in the same communities(25% vs. 13%) (Widom, 1989; Mrazek and Haggerty, 1994). Some cultures, particularly in Africa, believe that it takes a whole village to raise a child. This communal involvement takes pressure off parents and allows asharing of concern and responsibility. It also serves a preventive function by al-lowing parents a chance for respite and help on those days when stress bringstheir emotions near the boiling point. Clinical Signs of Child Abuse It is very difficult to predict the onset of abuse to a given child, because the riskfactors, while known, are too non-specific. In fact, they label far more parents\"at risk\" of abusing than ever go on to traumatize their children, and this mis-labeling can be hurtful to families. Once child abuse is discovered in a family,however, both that child and its siblings can be considered at high enough riskof further abuse to warrant secondary preventive efforts. Hence, identificationof existing cases is of critical importance. The following general clinical signs in an injured child raise the suspicion that intentional injury may have occurred, once other more probable causes havebeen shown to have been unlikely (taken from Kerfoot, 1992). 66 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 66Damage to surface tissue. Suspect abuse when the child has multiple bruises and the bruises are in places unlikely to be inflicted by an accidental event. Chil-dren too young to walk are unlikely to incur multiple bruising. Moreover, abuseoften damages the head, face, and middle of the back on both sides of the spine.Look for sets of small bruises which might result from a tight grip with thumband fingers, enough pressure to cause a small internal bleed. Black eyes in a young child are rarely accidental. If two black eyes are pres- ent and there is no injury of corresponding severity to the middle of the fore-head or bridge of the nose, the black eyes may have been inflicted separately andintentionally. Look for patterns in the bruises, such as the outline of a hand,small pairs of bruises from pinching, or linear welts or C or U shapes from a beltor its buckle. Lacerations and abrasions. These also warrant the health professional's exam- ination and careful thought. Lacerations of the lip or inside the mouth are sus-picious, but could be the unintentional result of a child falling with an objectin his or her mouth. Lacerations on the back of the hands are more likely to beintentional than those on the front of the hands, but once again, the explana-tion given by the adult must make sense. Burns and scalds. These are common injuries, and only about 2% of heat in- juries in young children are intentional. Kerfoot points out that the typicalinstance of a child pulling a pot of hot liquid off the stove results in the childsustaining burns under the chin and around the armpits and torso. When anadult uses this scenario to explain scalds in a different part of the body, more in-quiry is needed. Children who instinctively and quickly pull away from pain. This gives truly accidental burns irregular edges. Burns without evidence of withdrawal are sus-pect. The shape of a burn gives a clue as to the object involved. Cigarette burns, 67 INFANTS AND CHILDREN UP TO 14 YEARS OLDTHE EXPLANATION An adult who brings in a child for care will always have an explanation for the child's condition. The health professional should determine whether the story makes sense inlight of the nature, number, and distribution of the observed injuries. A medical examina-tion provides an opportunity to observe the child's entire body for scars, old bruises, andother signs of past damage. This might best be done with parents or other accompanyingpersons out of the room. If the child can talk, this provides an opportunity to obtain thechild's version about the incident and other findings. It is advisable to check also the child'sbuttocks and genitalia, without drawing attention to them, in the course of the examina-tion. Those are common sites for inflicted injuries. If more than one adult accompanies thechild, have them interviewed separately about circumstances of the injury. A hastily con-cocted false explanation may not be told consistently unless it was planned and rehearsedbetween the adults.51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 67especially if multiple, generally signal abuse. Carelessness or abuse involving hot water, such as in the bath, often presents as scalds having a glove or stockingconfiguration with straight edges on hands, feet, or buttocks. More criteria forthe diagnosis of intentional intracranial injuries and fractures are found in re-cent textbooks. Child Neglect In impoverished communities, many children may appear to be neglected to anoutside observer, as the family may be unable to provide desirable levels of ma-terial needs. In these situations, responsibility for upgrading the support of chil-dren lies with the community, state, and nation. There is no better investmentin a nation's future than removing barriers to the physical and mental develop-ment of its children. Each family should be able to supply its children with the most fundamental of needs: love, concern, nurture, self-acceptance, social support, and protectionfrom the adverse aspects of the physical, biological, and social environment. The absence of psychosocial caring often manifests itself in deficiencies in shel- ter, food, and clothing for a given child that are worse than those of the adultsor other children in the home, and worse than demanded by the level of re-sources available to that family as compared to others nearby. Sometimes a fam-ily unconsciously selects one child as a scapegoat for its troubles, and only thatchild shows signs of abuse and neglect. 68 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHHEALTH PROFESSIONALS' CHECKLIST FOR QUESTIONABLE INJURIES Health professionals who work in emergency clinics, physician's offices, or community health clinics can ask the following questions of the explanations given them about achild's (or other victim's) injury to help estimate the risk of it being intentionally inflicted: Does the injury have \"tell-tale\" characteristics of abuse, such as those mentioned above? Does the explanation of the event adequately account for the physical findings in terms of location and severity? If the child is claimed to have contributed to the accident by his or her own behaviors, has this child developed to the point that such motor activities are within his easyperformance? Are the explanations of the circumstances given by one or more responsible witnesses to one or more professionals all consistent? Was there delay in seeking medical care? If so, why? Based on the physical exam or on medical records, is there evidence of prior injuries in addition to the current problem? If so, can these also be explained with high probabil-ity? Might the child's supervision be deficient, or the home environment unsafe?51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 68Educating parents about how better to manage available resources and of the specific needs of very young children may improve circumstances. Sometimes itis useful to review the family's priorities and move the child's basic needs to ahigher level. The forces of consumerism encourage families to buy a televisionset rather than repair a leaky roof or provide children with shoes and sweatersfor cold weather. Health professionals may need to counter such messages andbring health priorities to the forefront in meetings with schools, local groups,churches, and individual families. Providing the media with news stories of pos-itive things parents can do will extend outreach even further. 69 INFANTS AND CHILDREN UP TO 14 YEARS OLDCHECKLIST OF SIGNS OF POSSIBLE NEGLECT FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS The following conditions, if severe or noted repeatedly over time, should initiate further inquiry or possibly a home visit, not for the purpose of inspection but rather a friendly visitto become acquainted with how things are going at home. Dwelling Place Does the home have adequate sanitation, including proper disposal of excrement, refuse, spoiled food, and trash? Is the home protected against rodents, insects, and other animals, as well as cold or rainy weather? Are sleeping areas clean, comfortable, and not too crowded? Is the home free of fire hazards and risks for falls, poisoning, scalding, etc. ? Nutrition Is food quality adequate and the diet balanced? Are food and eating utensils kept clean and free of spoilage and vermin? Are meals prepared for children and served at reasonably consistent times? Do the children always seem hungry or sleepy? Personal Hygiene and Care Are the children usually dirty and lacking in hygiene? Are their clothes usually dirty and not cared for (e.g., mended)? Are their clothes appropriate for the weather conditions? Do the children lack needed medical and dental care? (If these are not accessible, affordable, or acceptable, perhaps changes are needed at the community level.) Are underage children left unsupervised for long periods of time or supervised only by other underage children? Tertiary Prevention If further investigation shows that young children are being chronically abused or neglected, health or welfare agencies may need to intervene on their behalf,such as by removing either the abuser or the victim from the dwelling. The sys-tems for dealing with such problems differ across communities and cultures.The primary concern must be for the child's safety, health, and well being. Ifthe child's own family can be helped to do better, that might be the best choice.51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 6970 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHHowever, case reports and newspapers all too frequently tell the story of a child dying of further abuse after being sent back to his or her own family after oneor two previous visits for emergency medical care. Secondary Prevention of Abuse and Neglect Demographic risk factors: children born to single parents or to teenagers; children who were unwanted pregnancies that continue to be resented; children born to parents who are chronically in conflict; adults living in the home who use alcohol and drugs to the point of losing control; children living in homes of lowest socioeconomic status or whose parentshave attained only low education levels; the family's daily life is seriously disorganized and unpredictable (often a re-sult of earlier items mentioned); the child is between 3 months and 3 years (time of greatest vulnerability); children who appear different from the average, children who cry a lot, andthose with handicaps are most likely to be targeted for harsh treatment. Psychosocial risk factors: parents who were raised in abusive or neglectful homes and reenact these be- haviors with their children; male partner's jealousy and fear of losing \"first place\" in the woman's atten-tion and love for the child inadequate knowledge of child development, both for normal children anddevelopmentally handicapped children. Failure to recognize the wide vari-ability in reaching developmental milestones and the inability of the veryyoung \"to control themselves\" may lead to unreasonable parental demands,outrage that they are \"not being obeyed,\" and, finally, child abuse. Primary Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect The fundamental strategies for primary prevention of this worldwide epidemic are all psychosocial in nature.51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 70Adults and teenagers (the next generation of parents) should be educated in infant and child development and its wide variability from child to child. Thiswill replace ignorance or wrong ideas and expectations about child develop-ment and children's mental and emotional capacities at early ages. What a par-ent or prospective parent expects of children will influence how they react.Much child abuse originates from adults placing demands on children thatthey control behaviors (e.g., crying, toilet training, grabbing and droppingfragile items) that they are too immature to manage well all the time. This iswhy children who are developing more slowly than the average child straintheir caretakers' patience and endure an undue share of punishment. Parents should be educated about how children may best be rewarded andpunished at each age, thus making behavior change more efficient and lessfrustrating both for parents and children. Some parents or political or religious groups argue that programs to prevent child abuse take away parental rights to punish their children, leaving themwith unruly children. This is a false argument. Discipline is intended to teachthe child, not as a way for the adult to discharge his or her anger. Modernbehavioral science has found many ways to correct those behaviors that thechild is developmentally able to control,based on timely scolding, non-damagingphysical contact, brief periods (minutes)of isolation, and the rewarding of \"good\"behaviors so the child can substitutethem for \"wrong\" behaviors. Reinforce-ment\u2014positive or negative\u2014is most effective in very young children whendone within seconds of the event calling for it. Only when children havegrown to have an adequate cognitive recognition of past time and the behav-iors they performed can they respond properly to punishment or rewards foracts done at other times and places. Babies and young children are biologically programmed to fret and cry when in pain or sick in some way. They often cannot turn off crying, any morethan they can turn off vomiting or bleeding. The first task of the parent con-fronted with crying is to find out what is causing it. Often guidance can beobtained from an older, more experienced parent. If excessive crying persists,diagnosis and care by a health professional may be required. After reachingthe age of 1 or 2 years some children use crying, not only to signal illness,discomfort, or grief, but also to change parental behavior in the absence of a real problem. Such crying is better stopped by ignoring the child until the crying stops, rather than by physical punishment. If such crying spellsbecome unduly extended or repetitive, assistance from a health professionalis warranted. 71 INFANTS AND CHILDREN UP TO 14 YEARS OLDThere is no better investment in a nation's future than removing barriersto the physical and mentaldevelopment of its children.51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 71Most first-time parents do not realize how much average infants cry every day. Botash and colleagues (1996) cite four studies of infants' crying. St.James-Roberts (1991) reported that 29% of infants cried more than threehours daily during their first three months. Brazelton found that 50% of nor-mal, full-term infants cried or fussed more than 2.75 hours daily. Baildam et al. (1995) found that crying reached its peak at around six weeks of age.Removing fussing and crying spells lasting less than 5 minutes resulted in arange of 0 to 26 crying episodes 15 minutes or longer, with an average of 4.4spells per child per day. Parents and prospective parents need to expect those ranges of crying dura- tions, and should not punish the baby for its normal organic responses. Cry-ing time decreases in most infants as they get beyond 2 or 3 months of age.This is both because the infants' physiological controls and back-up systemsgain greater capacity, and because parents learn what various cries mean atdifferent times (e.g., when hungry or after defecating), and thus can correctthe cause of the crying more promptly. A clinical study showed that when experienced mothers, given brief training in behavioral management, were assigned to give telephone guidance to newmothers with babies younger than 6 months of age, the behavioral manage-ment counseling over a term of three to four months reduced daily crying andfussing by about 51%\u2014from a baseline average of 346 minutes to a post-counseling average of 169 minutes (cited in Botash et al., 1996). Such counseling programs could be incorporated into community health ac- tivities directed against all manner of childhood illnesses and injuries. Becausethese efforts are carried out by volunteers, they are inexpensive to conduct.The only costs are for a professional to train the volunteers, to encourage par-ticipants, and to receive referrals of difficult cases. It is critical to educate the community, including women's groups, men'sgroups, health professionals, school teachers, and schoolchildren, about thedifferences between legitimate discipline and physical, psychosocial, and sex-ual abuse. This will help define and raise consciousness about communitynorms for child-rearing. Children should learn about these matters in an age-appropriate way, because people outside their nuclear family, such as baby-sit-ters or more distant relatives, may abuse them. Sexual abuse is often inflictedon children ages 5-12 years and often has long-term negative effects. Hence,it is important that young schoolchildren learn what kinds of \"games\" and in-timate touching are unacceptable. Children who are aware may also be ableto protect younger siblings from physical abuse and neglect. As stated bymany, it takes a whole village to raise a child safely. 72 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 72Parents and other adults who are in contact with children should receive as- sistance in impulse control. The previous three interventions deal with thecognitive aspects of prevention; this step addresses the emotional-behavioralcomponents. Many parents and child-care workers may have all the essentialknowledge regarding child development and teaching behaviors, but their en-vironmental frustrations and unruly tempers allow them to strike out at chil-dren in dangerous ways. Both men and women are at risk. One approachreported to be successful (but documentation is not available at this time) in strengthening impulse control is organizing anger management groups ofparents who feel themselves at risk of hurting children, plus those with arecord of being abusive, along with a group counselor trained in impulse man-agement and group therapy. Members of the group share their problems/situations (including triggers to rage) and also their coping methods underthe guidance of the counselor. More evaluative studies need to be done to testalternative approaches. Parents must learn to take \"time-off.\" Social service programs that reduce theload\u2014or overload\u2014of parenting also are useful, at least during crisis periods.Such programs may provide volunteer baby-sitters (including \"volunteergrandparents,\" day care, or after school activities on one or more half-days perweek) to allow an overloaded parent to get rest, respite, recreation, or recu-peration. This strengthens the parent to cope more effectively the rest of theweek. Prevention or early treatment of child abuse and neglect has lifetime benefits for the mental health and social adjustment of the children being helped.Child abuse and neglect can be reduced dramatically and the future of eachcommunity and nation uplifted. SCREENING SUMMARY FROM BIRTH TO AGE 4 YEARS The last several sections have covered issues common both to infancy and ages1-4 years. We previously have given screening suggestions for pregnant womenand newborns. Now we present suggestions for screening children ages 1-4years, as a summary of the sections dealing with specific disease groups, injuries,abuse, and neglect. Items 10-13 are important foundations for a child's future mental health. If these issues are amiss in a group of children, they may become less able to con-tribute to the community's future productivity, even if they have good \"physicalhealth.\" Their bodies can be viewed as well maintained vehicles in the hands ofimpaired, reckless, or purposeless drivers. 73 INFANTS AND CHILDREN UP TO 14 YEARS OLD51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 73As babies and children mature through youth and adulthood, they carry the patterns of interactions and expectations learned first in the family into later in-teractions with playmates, school peers, teachers, and adults in the community.Hence, to be most effective, efforts to promote mental and social health, as wellas physical health, must be started early in childhood. 74 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHSCREENING CHECKLIST FROM BIRTH TO AGE 4 YEARS 1. Ask how often the child has respiratory infections (using local terms), and find out how severe they get and how are they treated. 2. Ask about diarrhea. How often has the child experienced episodes and how long did they last; was there any blood in the stool; was the child treated with ORT? 3. Check height, weight, and head circumference to measure development and identify stunting or obesity. 4. Check for iron deficiency anemia.5. Make sure immunizations are up to date for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio (if outside of eradicated areas), measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, and other diseasesof local importance. 6. Do tuberculosis test if family is at high risk.7. Ask about the habit of \"pica\" (the chewing and swallowing of non-food substances). It is a major risk factor for childhood poisoning, including often fatal toxicity fromlead, which damages the heart, liver, kidneys, and especially the brain, resulting inlowered mental function and behavior disturbances among survivors. 8. Ask about smoky air in the home, either from tobacco or cooking or home heating.9. Review injury risk to toddlers: hot water temperatures; access to stove (and hot uten- sils), heating sources, matches, firecrackers, soaps and cleansers, kerosene, heatingoil, chemicals, pesticides, un-gated stairways, unscreened high windows. All medicinesshould be kept in childproof containers. Firearms, if any, should be kept unloaded,stored, and locked where children cannot reach them. 10. Ask about how children are punished when naughty. Is it age-appropriate? Is it too severe for the wrong that was done? 11. Be alert for signs of child neglect and abuse, including poor hygiene, continual hunger, chronic unusual fatigue, inadequate clothing in cold weather, bruises, cuts orburns on face, neck, back of hands, back, buttocks, or genital area. 12. Is there continuity of care by the same few adults, all of whom uphold consistent standards of care and provide the child a predictable and loving environment? 13. Is the child's human and physical environment stimulating to sensory and cognitive development? 14. If the child rides in motor vehicles, are child safety seats used during the child's first few years of life and are seat belts used later? Children should ride in the back seat. 15. Provide fluoride supplements to children in areas where water has less than 0.7 ppm of fluoride. 16. As soon as the child can respond appropriately (preferably before age 3 or 4 years) check hearing and eyesight, if sensory limitations have not previously been reported.This may be done simply and clinically if testing equipment is not available. 17. In climates where injury by fire or smoke is a concern, encourage or assist in obtaining smoke detectors if dwelling is at risk of fire, or if escape may be delayed. 18. Check blood pressure (using child cuff and norm data).51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 74FROM AGES 5 THROUGH 14 YEARS MAJOR HEALTH PROBLEMS The world over, death rates for children aged 5 to 14 years are 50% to 80% lower than for children 1 to 4 years old in the same country. Larger declinesoccur in those countries that have the highest mortality in the early years. Thesemid-to-late childhood years are the healthiest of the entire life-span, both interms of mortality and permanent disability. Those children who survive past age 4 years have built up biological immunity, physiological reserves, improved homeostatic controls, and the mental skills (in-cluding experience and communication) to avoid most danger. This benignhealth situation changes for the worse with the coming of puberty, however. In the Region of the Americas, mortality rates for this age level range from about 23 per 100,000 in Canada to somewhere around 150 per 100,000 in some areasin Central America\u2014more than a six-fold difference. Six nations in the Ameri-cas had rates higher than 100 per 100,000 in 1985-1989 (PAHO, 1994), as domany other countries elsewhere in the world. In nations with low overall deathrates, \"external causes\" (injuries, both intentional and unintentional) are theleading single cause of death. In nations with less developed health infrastruc-ture (lack of pure water, sanitation, vector control, immunization, primaryhealth care coverage) infections and parasitic diseases are the prime causes ofdeath, with external causes second. T ropical diseases still are major disablers andkillers (PAHO, 1994, 1998, 2002; Murray and Lopez, 1996). Gender differences become more pronounced in these ages, with boys having 30% to 90% greater death rates than girls. The excess in death rates amongmales comes primarily from injuries. This is the age at which interventionsshould begin at the social and cultural levels\u2014particularly with boys\u2014to deglam-orize risk-taking, assaultive, and destructive behaviors. This is important to ad-dress now because over the next 20 years of the life cycle the male-to-femaledeath ratio becomes even more skewed, with many countries experiencing a 3 to1 male excess at ages 15 to 24 and/or ages 25 to 34 years. The difference is largelydue to trauma and violence. Health professionals must become more active inhelping educators, parents, and the media to instill the important distinction be-tween constructive manliness and ignorant, destructive machismo. In most areas where motor vehicles are widely available, they are the major con- tributors to traumatic death in middle and late childhood. This includes chil-dren walking or playing near roadways, as well as those riding in cars or trucksor on motorbikes. (Also see sections on preventing impact injuries inside and outside motor vehicles earlier in this chapter.) For many nations, 75 INFANTS AND CHILDREN UP TO 14 YEARS OLD51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 75drowning is the second most common traumatic form of death, especially in boys. (Find more detail in section \"Preventing Drownings,\" earlier in this chapter and in Chapter 11.) HEALTH PROMOTION OPPORTUNITIES Children and youth between the ages of 5 and 14 years are at an ideal stage to be taught the values and practices that will promote good health throughout the rest of their lives and to have those tenets reinforced. Children in this agerange are learning rapidly and developing firm beliefs and standards. Schools,recreational and social groups, and families can fill this fertile time of develop-ment with positive and healthy role models, knowledge, and lifestyles. Toooften, unfortunately, the news media in the 21st century reinforce the opposite. Earlier in this book we emphasized the importance of providing very young children with human relationships that are loving, supportive, trustworthy, andconsistent. These teach the child self-acceptance, a sense of self-worth, and ex-pectations that other people are nurturing and helpful. This learning takes placeat the level of feelings and expectations. After age 5, a child is better able toprocess cognitive learning about specific health-promoting and damaging fac-tors influencing physical and mental health and social relationships. Ages 5 to 14 years are the ideal ages to reinforce one of life's most important skills: how to get along\u2014to interact constructively\u2014with other people. This be-gins in infancy with immersion in dependable, loving care\u2014learning that peo-ple bring good things, including comfort and pleasure; that dependence shiftswith development to independence and interdependence. Controlling anger and respecting others also must be learned for fu-ture social, psychological, and physical health. Intheir important work, Anger Kills , Williams and Williams have comprehensively dealt with thisissue (1993). The ideal social setting provides so-cial interactions that are fair and that benefit allconcerned; in other words, \"win-win situations.\" Healthy social learning in childhood will prevent many problems at each laterstage of life. (See also the sections \"Conduct Disorders/Delinquency\" and \"Positive Mental Health\" in Chapter 7 for a comprehensive discussion.) A program for anger control among schoolchildren has been developed and tested by Olweus (1991). A major review was prepared by Feindler (1990). These are the ages in which to teach\u2014and personally demonstrate\u2014healthy eating habits; personal hygiene; avoidance of unsafe food, water, and sources of parasites; how to reduce risks for injuries; the value of learning; how to dealwith troubling feelings and troublesome people; social amenities; and problem- 76 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHStudies have repeatedly shown that groups that consume many whole grains, vegetables, and fruits develop fewer cancers and heart diseases.51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 76solving in an equitable manner. The child should be praised and taught how to reward himself or herself for these positive attitudes and behaviors. In theseyears children learn most deeply the values esteemed by the family, their reli-gious faith, and the benevolent, responsible segments of society. This is also the time to teach avoidance behaviors and to attach negative judg- ments to the objects of avoidance\u2014including rejecting health-damaging sub-stances such as tobacco, alcohol and other drugs, and inhalants; high-risk be-haviors; peers who urge aggressive or self-destructive problem-solving; prematureor unsafe sexual activity; feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or violence; self-debasement to the point of impairing one's achievement; and distrust of othersto the extent of isolation, paranoia, or alienation. These strong internalized per-sonal foundations will promote physical, mental, and social health for a long andvaluable lifetime. These childhood years are the prime time for children to develop tastes in food. When older adults talk about vegetable stew or chocolate cookies \"the wayMother used to make them,\" they are remembering the experiences of thesechildhood years. The message to us is that this is the time to create a taste formany kinds of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. If meal times are happy times,all the foods of childhood will be enjoyed more and will continue to be experi-enced throughout adulthood with pleasant memories. Similarly, this is the agein which to discourage the eating of fatty foods, candies, and junk food, whichappears attractive but contains too much fat, sugars, or salts, and lacks fiber andessential nutrients. Parents can better reinforce such eating habits in their chil-dren\u2014as well improve their own health\u2014by eating the same healthy foods. Clinical and community studies have repeatedly shown that groups consuming many whole grains, vegetables, and fruits develop fewer cancers and heart dis-eases than groups eating more empty calories: refined grains, fatty meats andcheeses, and other saturated fats. Excess alcohol consumption appears to raisethe risk of cancer at six different physical sites, an added reason to teach alcoholavoidance at these ages (T richopoulos and Willett (eds.), 1996). (Also see Chap- ters 9 and 13.) The period between ages 8 and 12 years has been recognized by schools as the most effective time to teach about the dangers of smoking cigarettes and chew-ing tobacco. Many, perhaps most, adult smokers begin this habit before age 15years. Teaching the facts alone has proved ineffective in delaying or eliminatingtobacco use. Facts must be supplemented by \"inoculating\" attitudes: presentingpro-tobacco arguments of peers and immediately countering these with argu-ments favoring abstinence. These counterarguments and refusal skills appear tobe best taught by role-playing among classmates, guided by teachers or olderpeers who themselves are non-users. With regard to motivations, having a 77 INFANTS AND CHILDREN UP TO 14 YEARS OLD51331_p049_096_r1 4/7/03 3:13 PM Page 77stained smile, bad breath, and immediate negative effects on sports performance provide much stronger avoidance motives than the risk of cancer or heart dis-ease 40 years hence. Preventive teaching curricula are available in major lan-guages. (See also section \"Tobacco Use\" in Chapter 13.) Health professionals should take the initiative to work with local educators and parent groups to reach the public with the many small but important steps theycan take to save children from trauma and disability. This unit on child healthand safety might well be included in health and home economics courses in sec-ondary schools and in parenting classes. 78 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHSCREENING CHECKLIST FOR AGES 5 TO 14 1. Make sure immunizations are up-to-date, especially upon entering school. Give booster shots for diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus, as well as polio in areas wherethe disease has not yet been eradicated. 2. Check height and weight and developmental milestones; make sure you look for obesity or stunting. 3. Check blood pressure. Compare to norms for each age.4. Encourage the child to learn to swim to reduce risk of drowning.5. Inquire about usual foods and drinks; ask about between-meals snacks as well as regular meals. Does the child eat regular meals? With family members? 6. Check for iron deficiency anemia. If blood tests are not practical, visual comparison of nail beds or oral mucosa with a blood color chart can serve as a rough screen. 7. Screen vision and hearing in terms of schooling needs (e.g., Can the child recognize printed letters and numbers? Can the child hear and understand usual speech fromacross a room?). 8. Ask about play areas in terms of the hazards for injury.9. Administer a tuberculosis test if family (or neighborhood) is at high risk. 10. Is the child's human and physical environment stimulating to sensory, cognitive, and emotional development? 11. Is there continuity of care by the same few adults, all of whom uphold consistent standards of care and provide the child with a predictable and loving environment? 12. Does the child have a safe (adult-supervised) place to go after school or when her/his family is not at home. 13.

Adolescents and Young Adults 15-24 Years Old NURTURING THE SEEDS FOR A HEALTHY FUTURE Planting the seeds for a healthy future was first discussed in the preceding chap- ter. Those early seeds include teaching children (by adult example) the highvalue of good health and how to build it through continuing health promotionand self-care. We included cleanliness to avoid infection, healthy eating, ade-quate exercise and sleep, keeping dangers out of household and play areas,avoiding careless and risky behaviors, and respecting and esteeming others aswell as oneself. Adolescence is the time to revisit these principles. Health concerns in this age group have changed, and young persons are beginning to take over the respon-sibilities formerly borne by their parents, including that of promoting their ownhealth and self-care for minor health problems. This, then, is the time to con-sider the following: Have healthy principles taken root? If so, they need encouragement so theycan flourish and meet the needs of the coming decades. On the other hand, if harmful behaviors and attitudes threaten to encroach,then pruning or clearing out may be called for at this time. Youth have entered a new season in their lives, and the tasks of those advocat- ing for health within the family and in schools, the workplace, and the com-munity must change with them. The over-all purpose is to establish inner controlsand outer goals that maintain a lifestylewhich prevents disability and postponesthe chronic diseases that are so commonand damaging in adults of middle andolder age. It has become the fashion foryouth's mentors to face this stage of lifewith apprehension, and for good reason. The physical, psychological, and social transitions that youth go through revo- lutionize both their ways of living and their health problems. In agriculturalareas and in areas where industrialization is first beginning, childhood ends 79 ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS 15-24 YEARS OLDIf birth is the \"launching pad\" of life, adolescence, with its acceleratingpower and rapid changes, representsthe \"booster-rocket stage\" that willdetermine how high the future Adolescence holds thepotential for great lives.51331_p097_126_r1 4/7/03 3:14 PM Page 79when boys and girls become large enough physically to be put into full-time work. A shift in health problems occurs quickly, as the number of work injuriesand exposures to illnesses increase markedly. Heavy demands are placed uponincompletely grown bodies; farm or factory machinery is placed in inexperi-enced hands and operated by workers whose prudence, judgment, and contin-uous self-control have not yet matured. The result is injuries on the job andwhile traveling on the roads by bicycle or motor vehicles to and from the work-site. In addition, psychologically immature youth may be abused by others. To the extent that youth working long hours are drained of energy and physio- logic renewal beyond what their available nutrition and sleep can restore,youth's growth, maturation, and sexual development may be impaired. This was endemic during the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, and still may often be seen today, if looked for in communities where child labor ratherthan schooling is the norm. According to data from UNICEF (1992) close to 20% of all the world's chil- dren aged 10-14 years are working full-time and not attending school regularly.These figures run higher in developing and economically troubled areas. Fur-thermore, most of youth 15-18 years old are not going to school or receiv- ing training in most regions. Worldwide data re-veal strong links between low education and poorhealth in adulthood. Therefore, this loss of school-ing is breeding a new generation in which a highproportion of adults will experience health vul- nerabilities both in themselves and in their families. Education is the \"admissionticket\" to the changing new world and to the best chance for good health. Na-tions cannot leave their next generations facing the world with only the last gen-eration's skills. Epidemiologic studies show that youth (up to age 18) incur more physical dam- age to their bodies than do adults when exposed to the same levels of environ-mental toxins, especially silica, benzene, pesticides, and solvents. Youth also sus-tain more neurological damage from exposure to heavy metals than do adults.Some studies have found that workers under age 18 absorb more pesticides thando the adults working beside them in agricultural jobs. Why this is so has notbeen explained, but the message is that better training, better tools, and/or bet-ter protection are urgently needed (PAHO, 1994, p. 124). Many urban children ages 10-14 years work, and sometimes live, on the streets. They eke out a living by selling small items, washing cars, watching cars, andrunning errands. In rural areas, more of these children work on farms. In bothurban and rural areas many young children work in the construction trades\u2014and construction and mining are the industries responsible for the highest ratesof injury, disability, and mortality. The International Labor Organization is pro- 80 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHEducation is the \"admission ticket\" to a changing world and to the best chance for good health.51331_p097_126_r1 4/7/03 3:14 PM Page 80moting many legislative and regulatory efforts, but many nations resist enacting and enforcing these protective steps, largely influenced by economic pressures. All over the world, young people strive for independence from their families from puberty onward. They look to their peers for how to appear and behave,handle their sexual drive, try out their increasing physical and mental potency,and engage in risk-taking to impress oth-ers and challenge their own limits. Each ofthese developmental thrusts helps prepareyouth for their roles as adults and also de-termines the forms of morbidity, disability,and mortality they experience. More and more, the exposure of children andyouth to television, cinema, and now to the Internet, from distant parts of theworld, teaches personal behaviors, values (or antivalues), and lifestyles that may conflict with the local family culture, sometimes with destructive consequences.This chapter will review the major forms of mortality and morbidity for ages15-24 years, as well as the psychosocial causes of the most common diagnosesand essential rational-emotional learnings, as a way to lay the foundation forgood health both currently and later in life. MAJOR HEALTH PROBLEMS AT AGES 15-24 MORTALITY By age 15 mortality rates are starting their sharp rise that will continue for theremainder of the life cycle. From lifetime's age of lowest mortality\u20145 to 14years\u2014death rates rise by 50% to 100% for ages 15-24 years. Nevertheless,mortality remains below 100 deaths per 100,000 young women and between100 to 200 per 100,000 young men in most parts of the world. The leading cause of death both for males and females in these ages is trauma and injury. Motor vehicles are the leading cause for non-intentional deaths, es-pecially in those countries where vehicles are widely used. For young men homi-cide and suicide are major killers. Homicide is a severe epidemic in the Regionof the Americas. In a 1994 survey of 34 nations around the world (nine in theAmericas) that reported such data in the World Health Statistics Annual , only eight nations had male homicide rates greater than 10 per 100,000 for ages of15-24. The top seven of these were in the Americas, and their rates ranged from17 to 75. In contrast, Spain's rate was only 1.5. Middle Eastern Crescent nationsalso have elevated homicide rates among males. Rates of fatal biological disease creep up slightly from ages 15-24 years, with cancers and heart and blood vessel pathology being the two most common.However, a review of 16 nations in the Americas that report cause-specific mor- 81 ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS 15-24 YEARS OLDNations cannot leave their next generations facing the world with onlythe last generation's skills.51331_p097_126_r1 4/7/03 3:14 PM Page 81tality shows that for ages 15-24, the median percentage of all male deaths due to external causes is 72% (range 57% to 81%). For women ages 15-24, exter-nal causes account for a median of 34% of all deaths (range 22%-68%). Suicide first appears as a major cause of death starting at age 15. In most coun- tries, more males kill themselves than do females. The predisposing cause ofmost suicides is depression. Experiences of loss, defeat, frustration, humiliation,or hopelessness often trigger this destructive act. And, for each completed sui-cide there are many unsuccessful suicide attempts, with ratios varying widely bygender and nation. Hispanic countries have particularly low rates both for at-tempted and completed suicides. China has especially high suicide rates amongyoung women, as well as very high rates for very old adults of both genders. (Also see Chapter 11 for further discussion of suicide, homicide, and violence.) Since a suicide attempt is the strongest predictor of a future completed death, all attempts should be treated seriously. The young person who attempts suicideshould receive counseling, and the circumstances of the attempt should be stud-ied and the environment should be changed, if possible, to reduce risk of recur-rence. A major determinant of whether a suicide attempt is fatal is the weaponused. Guns have the highest fatality ratio. In addition, having a gun in the homeraises the risk of suicide for all family members. It also raises risk of homicidefor all. In homes with guns\u2014usually intended to protect the family\u2014familymembers or friends have a 30 times greater chance of being shot by those gunsthan does an intruder or robber. With disease mortality rates so low during age 15 to 24 years, the focus of health-promoting efforts shifts to reducing current morbidity and disability, aswell as working to reduce the risks of the major chronic diseases, which strikepeople mostly after age 40 years. MORBIDITY AND DISABILITY For every youth killed in vehicle accidents and for every homicide there aremany young persons temporarily or permanently injured. Thus, because of theirlarger contribution to both morbidity and disability, external causes deserve in-tensive prevention and control efforts. Injured survivors cost the communitymore resources in terms of medical care, and those killed cost the communityall they would have produced during the years of productive life they lost. Inmost WHO regions, death rates for the total of accidents and violence are twoto seven times higher in males than in females. Chronic diseases are infrequent,but some, such as AIDS and other STIs, tuberculosis, asthma, and diabetes, cancause serious disability in young adults they affect. 82 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p097_126_r1 4/7/03 3:14 PM Page 82Most of the other underlying causes of illness and disability in youth also are of social-behavioral origins\u2014use of tobacco, misuse of alcohol and narcotics,sexually transmitted diseases, and unwanted pregnancies, many of which areaborted. Habits developed during youth set the direction toward either a longerhealthier life or strong risks for chronic disease, disability, or earlier death fromcardiovascular, respiratory, or cancerous diseases. Risk Behaviors Tobacco Use. The greatest single life-long health gift families and communities can present to their youth is freedom from tobacco addiction. Tobacco is na-ture's vehicle to deliver nicotine, a sly drug that briefly calms the nervous, reac-tivates the tired, and has become a symbol (in some places) for social sophisti-cation. Nicotine then leaves the body with a craving for more. The chemicalcraving for nicotine among heavy smokers creates a rapid relapse rate for thosewho quit smoking that is quite similar in its speed to the relapse rate of addictswho have just quit heroin. Most tobacco by far is consumed through cigarette smoking. Pipe and cigar smoking are less common, and apparently less lethal. Tobacco also can be con-sumed as \"snuff\" or by chewing it, sometimes mixed with other substances andin other ways, depending on the local culture. Consuming smokeless tobaccogives rise to cancers of the oral cavity, head, neck, esophagus, pharynx, and lar-ynx, and it raises the risk for stomach cancer. (Also see section \"Cancers of the Oral Cavity, Esophagus, Larynx, and Pharynx\" in Chapter 9 and texton primary and secondary prevention in section \"Tobacco Use\" in Chap-ter 13.) Smoking turns tobacco's carcinogens form. The smoke\u2014which con- tains carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, hot gases, and tiny ash particles\u2014movesthrough the breathing apparatus and deposits itself in the lungs. From there, thesoluble portions, including nicotine and its metabolites, and carbon monoxide,pass into the bloodstream, which then carries them to the entire body. Scientists studying tobacco smoke have found in it 43 different carcinogens among an estimated 4,000 compounds. Most of these compounds have notbeen adequately tested for their possible cancer effects. The distant bodily effects of tobacco smoke are demonstrated by increased rates of cancer of the bladder and uterine cervix, plus all the respiratory organs andsome digestive organs. The recovery of a nicotine metabolite (cotinine) fromvaginal secretions, the damage to peripheral arteries in hands and feet, and thenumerous effects on the fetuses of pregnant women who smoke tobacco add tothe evidence of the far reach of tobacco pathology. 83 ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS 15-24 YEARS OLD51331_p097_126_r1 4/7/03 3:14 PM Page 83The effects of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), or exhaled smoke, have been proven repeatedly. Exhaled smoke in the home harms everyone livingthere. Similar dangers, ranging from respiratory infections to asthma, cancers,and heart attack, are present in smoky workplaces. The litany of tobacco-related diseases is long, but this information seldom per- suades teenagers, because the truly serious health maladies do not occur imme-diately, or even in five to ten years. The incubation, or latent period, is long, 20to 40 years, and most teens live for today and next month rather than for thefar future. The best leverage for primary prevention of tobacco is to base the argument on signs that occur immediately: bad breath, stained teeth, stained fingers, dimin-ished ability to taste pleasant foods, loss of endurance in sports and other activ-ities, shortness of breath, and the feeling of being under the control of a relent-less habit. In many cultural groups young people have decided that smoking or chewing tobacco is \"not smart,\" \"not cool,\" not a habit that the more successful youthshare. Building such a social norm, or reminding youth that such negative eval-uations are around them, are ways to advance primary prevention. Chapter 3 stated that the ideal time to start teaching anti-tobacco information and values is between ages 8-12 years. The teen years are when most smokingaddicts begin their habits. The earlier the age of starting, the earlier the likeli-hood of debilitating disease. The United States Surgeon General has estimated that one-third of youth that start smokingtobacco in their early teens will eventuallydie of a tobacco-related disease. The cigarette smoking epidemic began in the industrialized nations. The prevalence of smokers increased rapidly between 1914 and 1918 and again between 1939 and 1946. These were the years of the twoworld wars, during which tobacco companies provided free cigarettes to mili-tary personnel from European nations and the United States. The growing surgeof women's independence, coupled with clever and targeted advertising, re-cruited many women into the ranks of smokers. Meanwhile, the rates of pipeand cigar smoking and use of smokeless tobacco increased modestly. As cash in-come increased in developing nations, their younger people sought to mimicWestern lifestyles and rapidly experimented with tobacco\u2014and then got hooked.Without question, tobacco is an addictive drug. A smoking pandemic has swept areas that are in the early stages of industrial- ization. At the turn of the twenty-first century, nearly 70% of Chinese men 84 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHThe greatest single life-long health gift families and communities can present to their youth is freedom from tobacco addiction.51331_p097_126_r1 4/7/03 3:14 PM Page 84smoke, and the rates are similarly high elsewhere in Southeast Asia. Rates in Eu- rope and Latin America range around 50% for men. In the United States, theUnited Kingdom, Switzerland, and other similar countries, smoking rates havedecreased. In most places women have a lower prevalence of smoking, especiallyin traditional cultures. The rates for teenage girls are higher than for boys insome urban areas, especially where advertising glamorizes the habit. This war-rants special programming. The tobacco epidemic's decline is tracking the same course as the epidemic's emergence: smoking is declining in highly industrialized nations, with the great-est quitting rate among the more educated professional workers and the lowestquitting rates among less-educated laborers and women. As new knowledge and attitudes about smoking damage spread through areas and nations, the prevalence of tobacco use declines. Using this information intobacco prevention programs gives teachers added leverage in promoting healthyfuture-oriented lifestyles in youth. Information and knowledge, however, are notenough to change most behaviors. (The additional required forces are pre- sented in Chapter 12.) Misuse of Alcohol. This chemical abuse or dependency is a diagnosable disor- der by itself, but far more often it serves as a gateway to other serious problems.Chapter 7 presents further information about the health consequences and theprevention and treatment of alcoholism. Studies searching the histories of nar-cotics addicts typically report that tobacco was the substance first used for itschemical effect, then beer, followed by drinks with higher concentrations of al-cohol. Most youth stop at that point, but some go on to marijuana (cannabis)and fewer of these move to opiates, cocaine derivatives, or other designer drugs,depending on the addicts' local environment and available money. Low self-esteem; fearfulness; feelings of sadness, boredom, and social conflict or rejection; and the desire to feel and even to be different than one is\u2014especiallyin the presence of peer pressure\u2014provide the fertile ground from which eachyear's crop of new substance abusers springs up. This is a one-sentence oversim-plification of a complex set of problems that have been studiously researchedand voluminously reported from many parts of the world. Alcohol lowers self-control, dissolves good judgment, distorts perception, and impairs physical skills. Drinking alcohol, even at amounts below clinical intox-ication, raises the risk of all of the following: Unsafe sexual behavior. This can lead to unwanted pregnancy, uncared for pregnancy, the risks of abortion, and sexually transmitted diseases, includingHIV infection. None of these outcomes can be known\u2014or ruled out\u2014in thedays or first weeks after the exposure. This may provoke fears, remorse, self- 85 ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS 15-24 YEARS OLD51331_p097_126_r1 4/7/03 3:14 PM Page 85condemnation, or related psychological problems for months to come, even if the worse fears do not come true. Motor vehicle and pedestrian injuries. Even partial intoxication impairs per- ceptual and motor skills enough for fatal results. Autopsy and blood andbreath analyses for alcohol show it to be involved in about 50% of fatal road-way crashes, as well as 50% of fatal small boat crashes in many countries. Drownings. Many drownings among persons over age 15 (mostly males) are due to alcohol-induced poor judgment or show-off behavior. Keep in mindthat warm weather raises the frequency of drinking and swimming. Occupational \"accidents.\" These occur mostly (by count) in the absence of psychoactive chemicals, but the chances of their occurring are very highamong the few people who either have alcohol or drugs in their bodies or arehung over or trying to recover from a recent exposure to alcohol. Power-driven tools are most dangerous to chemically influenced persons both in fac-tories and on farms. Assaults and homicides. Both occur at highest rates when the attacker or the victim, or both, are under the influence of alcohol. This is more prevalentwhere the assaults and homicides are not primarily due to gang wars, nar-cotics dealing, or paramilitary violence. Suicides. These account for a higher percentage of mortality between ages 15-24 than at any other time in the life cycle\u2014and alcohol is involved inmany of these deaths. Persons suffering from depression and having suicidalideas often do not take the fatal step until after alcohol has made them feeleven more mental anguish, washed out their psychological defenses and bet-ter judgment, and reduced their fear about performing the killing act. Development of life-long chemical dependencies. Use of alcohol as self-medica- tion or escape from problems first creates a psychological dependency, usuallyfollowed by a chemical dependency. Most persons in all cultures can use al-cohol occasionally and moderately in social settings, either to celebrate orrelax. However, an important minority (estimated at about 10%) start fromthe periodic \"social drink\" and move to alcohol craving, frequent drinking,binge-drinking, the acute traumatic crises described above, anti-social behav-ior, trouble with the police, loss of job, separation from family, and loss ofmental and physical health. The important issue is that many chronic adultabusers of alcohol and drugs began their habits while adolescents. Use of Illegal Drugs. Narcotics and illegal drugs are used to change emotional states, fears, thoughts, urges, self-perceptions, and social interaction or to reducepain. Unfortunately, not all of the changes that occur are pleasant or anesthetiz- 86 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p097_126_r1 4/7/03 3:14 PM Page 86ing, even though that is what the user seeks and expects. Especially after re- peated or high-dose usage, drugs start to lose their effect, what is known ashabituation. Then emotions may become more painful, thinking more frag-mented, and withdrawal symptoms severe. Urges and goals focus only on get-ting more drugs, and fears center on not getting drugs. Social relations becomestrained or break, as the user, now an addict, has love only for his chemical andlove-hate for the persons that supply it. Drugs used differ by culture and geography, but they infiltrate all socioeco- nomic levels. Some drugs are smoked, some are taken as pills, some are injectedinto veins, and some are inhaled (glue, acetone, solvents that vaporize). Allrecreational drugs are used because they change brain function; unfortunately,they can often leave permanent brain damage after the thrill is gone. Somedrugs, such as cocaine, can create addiction after only one or two uses. Sinceaddiction treatment often fails, prevention is clearly the path of choice. Although marijuana (cannabis) is a milder drug, it can serve as a gateway for more damaging drugs. Public health and education professionals should be con-cerned about cocaine in its several forms; heroin; amphetamines and other up-pers; inhalants such as glue fumes, acetone, and aerosols; drugs injected by nee-dles; and steroids used without a doctor's prescription. Each of these damagingchemicals has many slang names; use those common in your area when inquir-ing about drug use in the street. Most drug use leads to drug tolerance: in other words, the usual dose does not give the usual effect, and increasing amounts are needed at ever increasing costs.Among men, this primarily leads to such crimes as assault and theft to get moremoney; secondarily, men may turn to prostitution, usually servicing men. Womenoften turn to prostitution for money, although they also may turn to theft. Because drug use confuses mental function, it also raises the risk of such trauma as from motor vehicles, falls, and burns. It can cause permanent damage to thebrain, heart, and other systems; overdoses may cause death. Drug users finan-cially support illegal drug suppliers, their crimes, and corruption. They damagefamilies and communities. Health officials must realize that these chemicalstravel a long distance, not only to damage individual bodies and minds, but alsofamilies, communities, public safety, and the body politic itself. Unsafe Sexual Behavior. In adolescence, sexual interests and impulses first be- come prominent drivers of behavior, and sexual drives remain strong through-out young adulthood. To quote a biologist-poet, adolescence is \"the efflores-cence of gonadal dominance.\" At every age risky sexual activities can cause anyone or more of over 20 sexually transmitted diseases (STIs), but the most vul-nerable period for acquiring STIs is between ages 15 and 44 years. Some STIscan be treated successfully if discovered and treated early. Others can never be 87 ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS 15-24 YEARS OLD51331_p097_126_r1 4/7/03 3:14 PM Page 87cured: they either permanent damage, as do herpes, papilloma, and hepa- titis virus, or they lead to premature death, as does HIV. Chlamydia causes almost nine times as much disability in women as in men, and the prevalences of gonorrhea and trichomoniasis also are somewhat higheramong women. HIV, however, remains more common in men. Most of the dis-ability from HIV and other STIs is sustained in the 25-44 year age range, butages 15 to 24 years are when promiscuous habits are formed and most of the in-fections are first contracted. Strength of sexual urges, their control, and their circumstances of expression are determined by a multiplicity of biological, psychological, and social forces, pastlearning, social values, and peer behaviors. All of these factors can be modified to help channel behavior towards safer andhealthier ways. Development of sociallydesirable beliefs, attitudes, and behavioralstandards is most successful when begun inchildhood, well before puberty. This is nota call for early sex education in terms of anatomic and fertility information, which should be initiated when locally ap-propriate. Rather, it affirms that beliefs and attitudes toward sexuality, respect forself and others, and restriction of sexual behavior to a permanent monogamousrelationship can begin well before the biological urges and social pressures com-plicate this learning process. The section on \"Unsafe Sex\" in Chapter 13 dis-cusses the worldwide epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases and presents ap-proaches to primary and secondary prevention and treatment for all age levels. Lack of Regular Exercise. Children naturally enjoy active play, whether it be running, jumping, lifting, carrying, pushing, and digging. It's enough to wearout adults watching them. This energy level usually continues through adoles-cence, then tapers off, as young adults become more mature and sedate. If, how-ever, regular aerobic exercise\u2014serious enough to raise the heart rate and requireheavier breathing\u2014can become a life-long habit, much weakness, tiredness,overweight, and vulnerability to illness can be prevented. Regular aerobic exercise (at least 30 minutes, four or more times per week) burns fat, converts dangerous cholesterol to a safer form, helps control bloodpressure, strengthens muscle and bone, and improves respiratory function andintestinal activity. It also helps remedy mild depression. Improving the fitness ofa population by increased exercise is the second most powerful way to reducefuture disease. Moderate exercise, such as walking, has almost the same benefi-cial effect as running or strenuous exercise. Walking also has less risk of strainsor injuries to muscles and joints. Thirty to forty minutes of walking four ormore times a week\u2014if done at a speed to raise heart rate and increase the pace 88 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHImproving the fitness of a population by increased exercise is the second most powerful way to reduce future disease.51331_p097_126_r1 4/7/03 3:14 PM Page 88of breathing\u2014will have great benefits, including reducing the future risk of adult-onset (Type II) diabetes. Youth is the time to develop skills and interests in activities that can last a life- time\u2014hiking, bicycling, tennis, swimming, and weight training. Doing workthat exercises muscles, lungs, heart, and maintains strength and flexibility addsto fitness. The sports of children and youth (e.g., games that involve running,such as soccer and basketball) are a great way to start. A favorite \"active\" activ-ity should be maintained throughout the life span. Later, in adulthood, sportsmay be less competitive and less strenuous, but with age-grouped sports, thereare \"senior competitions\" such as swimming meets and tennis tournaments forpeople in their seventies and eighties. Too many people become sedentary toosoon. In the US in the 1980s and 1990s the one risk factor producing the mostexcess cases of coronary heart disease was lack of physical exercise. (See the section on \"Major Health Problems\" in Chapter 6 and the section on\"Physical Inactivity/Sedentary Lifestyle\" in Chapter 13.) Unhealthy Eating Habits. Some areas experience seasonal or year-round food shortages. In these areas, the goal for adults in times of plenty is to consumeenough calories to prevent major weight loss and enough protein to maintainorgan and muscle functioning, even through seasonal shortages. In more areasof the post-industrial world, however, seasonal shortages are a thing of the past.It is \"overnutrition\" that has become the problem. In these areas, restriction ofcaloric intake is the goal, while maintaining adequate protein, mineral, vitamin,and fiber consumption. In many cultures, recreational foods\u2014sometimes aptlydubbed junk food\u2014have become popular with both young and middle-agedadults. They are full of calories but relatively empty of essential nutrients, suchas amino acids, vitamins, minerals, and anti-oxidants. Candy, carbonated sodas,beer, fried chips, pastries, and cakes are examples of junk food. Health is pro-moted by restricting\u2014or altogether avoiding\u2014foods heavy in fat (especially sat-urated fat), sodium, or \"empty calories.\" Regular consumption of whole grains,vegetables, salads, fruits, and protein sources low in saturated fats (lean meats,fish, poultry, milk products, and many kinds of beans) represents a health-giving dietary pattern appropriate from early childhood to old age, unless amedical problem leads a physician to recommend a temporary change. Psychologically-driven Eating Disorders. Particularly in economically well- developed nations where food is plentiful, several psychologically-driven eatingdisorders have developed, especially among girls and young women. Womenaged 15-34 years old have the highest prevalence of eating disorders, manifestedeither as abnormally high or abnormally low caloric intake. Anorexia nervosa,bulimia nervosa, binge-eating, and chronic excessive eating leading to obesityare the most commonly seen eating disorders. 89 ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS 15-24 YEARS OLD51331_p097_126_r1 4/7/03 3:14 PM Page 89Weight-losing Disorders. Women have a tenfold higher frequency of weight- losing disorders compared to men. In earlier generations, eating disorders werelimited to a few post-industrialized countries, but with the spread of modernurban culture by movies and television, anorexia nervosa, in particular, mayoccur almost anywhere. Anorexia nervosa at onset is a mental health problem ofseveral origins. The primary risk factor both for anorexia and bulimia is \"dieting,\" the inten- tional major restriction of caloric intake in order to lose or maintain weight(Hsu, 1996). The prevalence of dieting is about 50% in American women and40% in Swedish women (Hsu, 1996); the prevalence of dieting is low in devel-oping countries, but increases with Westernization. Whatever the psychodynamics and tactics for \"self starvation,\" most patients with anorexia compulsively pursue physical activity, thus burning up more calo-ries. Their dieting approaches a food phobia. At some point in the weight lossprocess, metabolic changes progress, leading to amenorrhea and other moreserious biological changes. These can even result in death, if the patient is nothospitalized to receive metabolic as well as psychiatric care. A related disorder is bulimia nervosa, characterized by binges of overeating, often followed by self-induced vomiting (purging). This behavior also has a com-plex psychogenic origin, and is now suspected to have some neurobiologicalroots. Bulimia has profound biopsychosocial effects on patients, overlappingwith those of anorexia. Affective disorders, such as anxiety and depression, arecommon co-morbidities both for bulimia and anorexia. Both these weight-losing disorders cause malnourishment symptoms similar to those found ingroups suffering from famine. L.K.G. Hsu's review (1996) estimates the preva-lence of eating disorder cases in local populations sampled from the UnitedStates, the British Commonwealth, and Scandinavia to range from 0.1% to0.8% for anorexia, and from about 1% to 3% for classic bulimia, ranging up to7% for full and partial bulimia combined (this last figure from Virginia, USA). The frequency of dieting nearly doubles between ages 14 and 18 years in West- ernized girls. Although dieting and weight loss are benign for more than 95% of 90 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHTWO COMMON DYNAMICS OF WEIGHT-LOSING EATING DISORDERS The adoption of an ideal body image that is unhealthily slim, like female movie stars and models.

The patient appears to believe, at some level, that starving will postpone sexual development which is perceivedas frightening.51331_p097_126_r1 4/7/03 3:14 PM Page 90girls and young women, communities or health clinics seeing enough cases of full or partial anorexia or bulimia can screen for these problems inexpensively by iden-tifying persons who are following severe caloric restriction. Only about half ofthose on diets are overweight by weight-height tables, and those who are markedlyunderweight for their height are at highest risk for an eating disorder. Femalegymnasts or dancers also tend to be at higher risk. Girls on diets see themselves as\"too fat,\" whereas boys on diets are usually trying to increase muscle mass. One can help prevent eating disorders by targeting group-based educational programs to young women, to try and get them to adopt more healthful andnatural \"ideal body images,\" adopt nutritionally sound eating patterns, andlearn the present and future nutritional dangers inherent in most of the constantand rapid fire parade of \"crash diet\" fads streaking through the culture. Weight-Gaining Disorders\u2014Obesity. Chronic overeating rests somewhere be- tween an eating disorder and a noxious lifestyle; when coupled with a lack ofadequate physical activity, the result is obesity. The prevalence of obesity con-tinues to rise mostly in industrialized nations, and transitional nations are nowstarting this pattern. (In much of the developing world, undernutrition andstarvation remain the overriding problems). In industrialized areas, obesity isincreasing more rapidly among families with low education, less income, andamong people of color. This appears to be tied to the fact that starchy and fattyfoods are cheaper than vegetables, fruits, and protein-rich foods; long-standingcultural food preferences; and\u2014in a potentially healthy body image favored by rich, urbane Caucasians. Overeating may sometimes be encouraged by parents who have experienced food shortages. They continually urge their children to eat more at meals and to eatsnacks, perhaps driven by a fear that food shortages may occur again, or perhapsin the belief that fat children are healthier. Often when families immigrate fromareas of food shortages to areas where food is plentiful, there are substantialweight gains for everyone in the family. These gains are healthful until the nor-mal range of weight (for height and age) is reached. Beyond that, adding moreweight does not increase health nor enhance the appearance of success. Williamson (1995) estimates that about 34% of adults in the United States are overweight. Prevalence is slightly higher in women than in men and increaseswith age. Prevalence of overweight also is high in Western Europe. Overweight,as measured by Body Mass Index (BMI=weight in kg divided by height in m 2), is not as specific a health threat as obesity. Some persons with higher BMIs, usu-ally men, carry much of their weight in muscle mass\u2014witness physical laborersand athletes. Obesity can be inferred from weight and height, but the determi-nation is more validly based on estimation of percentage of weight that is fat.This can be most simply calculated from measures of skin fold thickness (sur-face fat). 91 ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS 15-24 YEARS OLD51331_p097_126_r1 4/7/03 3:14 PM Page 91Childhood obesity has been increasing in the United States at least since 1960. Populationsurveys taking skin fold measures estimatethat about 20% of the country's children are obese. The health implications are wor-risome: for example, obesity appears to bethe leading cause of childhood hypertension(Dietz, 1995), and obesity is associated withunhealthy serum lipid profiles both in chil-dren and adults. Although survey data is quite scanty, obesity appears to be less common in developing countries. The greateramount of physical exertion and reduced access to high calorie, low nutrient\"junk food\" in developing countries may help account for this. The most common medical complications caused by obesity in adults are hy- pertension, adult-onset diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, ischemic impairment, arthritis, gout, and perhaps somecancers. Fat distribution affects the complications of obesity, with heavy fat de-posits in the central abdominal area being most harmful physiologically. It alsopromotes a negative self-image and psychological discomfort in many youngeradults. Adolescence may be the best time to mount primary and secondary prevention programs against obesity, because this is the age at which individuals becomemore independent in their food choices and also when many cases of chronicovereating begin. Further, many youth \"develop a taste\" in childhood for foodsthat are rich in fats, sugars, and calories. Their new independence should be ac-companied by social experiences in sharing more healthful food choices. Psychologic/Psychiatric Concerns. While the foundations for psychological and behavioral health are established in childhood, enduring psychological dis-orders are usually not recognized clinically until adolescence. Mental deficiencyand some rarer disorders, such as autism, are usually discovered in early child-hood, but the more common emotional and behavior problems of childhoodare generally \"outgrown\" far before the teen years. Most schizophrenic syndromes first manifest themselves between the ages of 15 and 34 years. Their incidence varies widely across nations and social classes,with the most disadvantaged generating the most cases. Severe psychoses remainrelatively infrequent in most places, with prevalence under 2%. The most common emotional-behavioral problems in youth, as well as in adults, are depression and anxiety. Eating disorders, which particularly besetyoung women in some populations, are usually accompanied by conflicts in-volving anxiety and depression. Anxiety, specific fears, depression, and feelings 92 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHAdolescence may be the best time to mount primary and secondary prevention programs against obesity, because this is the age at which individuals become more independent in their food choices and also when many cases of chronic overeating begin.51331_p097_126_r1 4/7/03 3:14 PM Page 92of low self-worth all make interpersonal relationships uncomfortable. This often impairs the social skills required for successful adjustment to work, school, andfamily. Anxiety, depression, and hostility, when long-lasting, also interact withneurophysiologic, endocrine, and immune system functioning in ways that maycause or worsen \"physical\" illnesses, such as gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, en-docrine, and dermatologic disorders. Young people are more likely to act out their frustrations and unhappiness than to repress or discuss them. This \"acting out\" often leads older adults to complainabout the younger generation\u2014a dynamic that has been occurring at least sinceearly Egyptian times. Many risk factors have their source in impulsive behaviors. Unfiltered by knowledge or experience and unmediated by \"common sense,\" these rash ac-tions are sparked by feelings, attitudes, impulses, or peer pressure, without fore-thought about potential harm. Examples of these impulsive and risky behaviorsinclude taking chances in roadways as a walker, cyclist, or driver; taking one toomany alcoholic drinks; experimenting with drugs; being chronically angry; pro-voking fights; spending leisure time among persons who carry weapons; engag-ing in rash sexual behavior; neglecting to fasten seat belts in an automobile; fail-ing to use safety and protective work gear; \"playing with fire\" in any of its forms.All these risks involve misjudging oneself to be more invulnerable and the lawsof nature more forgiving than is the case in either. (Public health approaches aimed at generating mental and social resources for impulse control andpositive mental health are discussed in the sections \"Conduct Disor-ders/Delinquency\" and \"Positive Behavioral and Mental Health\" in thesection \"Malnutrition\" in Chapter 13.) PSYCHOSOCIAL FOUNDATIONS OF MOST HEALTH PROBLEMS AT THESE AGES Changes in \"the whole person\" that is trying to emerge out of each youth dur- ing adolescence include exposure to a different road map for life from the onelearned at home during childhood. Helpers in this \"map making\" venture in-clude other youth, teachers, the mass media, media-made \"heroes,\" and othergroups at school, at work, in religious groups, and on the streets. In an effort toshed the restraining values and habits imparted by their families, youth mayturn to any of these sources of influence\u2014for better or for worse. Other striv-ings also mold youth\u2014to be accepted, liked, popular; to prove one's indepen-dence, maturity, and talents. For young males, the surge of endocrines and the pressure from male peer group competitiveness derail rationality and give rise to \"machismo\"\u2014a brash displayof dominance, toughness, competitiveness, reckless showing off, and possessive 93 ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS 15-24 YEARS OLD51331_p097_126_r1 4/7/03 3:14 PM Page 93sexuality. Machismo finds expression in every culture, and every culture has a name for it. It leads to aggressiveness and intentional violence, which is an in-creasing threat worldwide and locally. Intentional violence causes more than 1.4million years of life with disability (YLD) worldwide each year, and men sustainmore than five times as much of this damage as do women (Murray and Lopez,1996, p. 540). (See further discussion in Chapter 11.) Young females rebel, too, and fall prey to the urge to be their \"own persons,\"usually accompanied by a yearning to be accepted, popular, and to receiverecognition\u2014or seize it, if necessary\u2014but now from sources outside the family.This usually involves exchanging the family's standards and goals for those ofthe peer group and the media's heroines. Often young women also take in-creased risks, often sexually, and may become \"oppositional\" to authority. Young men and women also share these other complicating traits: A sense of invulnerability .Young people feel they can \"beat the odds\" and not be hurt by being reckless on the road or taking risks with alcohol, drugs,boasting, fighting, and careless sex. Some may also assume they can learnwithout studying or achieve without adequate commitment. Living only in the present. Youth focus on immediate possibilities and grat- ifications, paying far less attention to the years ahead. It is important to notethat young adults with more education have a greater future perspective thanless educated ones, who live more in the now. Impulsiveness in making choices. Adolescents and young adults tend to make quick decisions and act upon them promptly. Both their sense of invul-nerability and their living in the present contribute to this, as well as the ten-dency of many to think primarily about themselves. In addition, many ofyouth's choices that affect their health are not made with health in mind. In fact, the reasons may be far different\u2014to displayindependence, to express rebellion, to win atten-tion, to impress peers, to get a thrill, to test theirlimits. This is important to understand, becauseit means that giving more health informationwill not change behavior until health motives be-come a part of the decision-making equation. All these are limitations in young people's ap- proach to living that youth themselves\u2014andthose who care about their healthy develop- ment\u2014must seek to overcome. But the behavioral vulnerabilities and healthcrises in millions of young people cannot be solved by every adult becoming agood role model or teacher to an adolescent at a time\u2014or even to whole class- 94 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHHaving a fully developed time perspective enables persons to better plan for the development of their family, career, middle age, and older years. It also equips them to respond to public health programs that have future payoffs for individuals, families, and communities.51331_p097_126_r1 4/7/03 3:14 PM Page 94rooms at a time. Actually, young people not attending school experience far higher rates of health and social problems. To succeed, prevention must have awider reach. It must also work through the social and cultural environments. Inalmost every populated place in the world, persons ages 15-24 years are suffi-ciently protected from the physical environment and have developed resistanceto harmful aspects of the biological environment. Cause-specific morbidity andmortality data support this conclusion. The environmental levels most responsible for the maladies of this age group are the interpersonal , the social/economic , and the cultural/ideological . Youth culture, fueled now as never before by the mass media, contains new ideas; new kinds of\"heroes\"; and novel ways of dressing, talking, and rebelling, around which sub-groups can rally and identify themselves with. Much of the \"cargo list\" in thecultural environment is beneficial, much is harmless passing fad, and the re-mainder\u2014to borrow infectious disease terminology\u2014acts as an agent-infectingbehavior, so as to raise risks to the health problems of this age group. To continue the infectious disease analogy, these ideologically toxic agents of unhealthy behavior are transmitted in the interpersonal environment by person- to-person contact. For example, youth learn to use illegal drugs mostly by per-sonal contact with other users. The mass media may serve as a vector to dispersethe agents far and wide. Often, however, the media simply lower host resistanceto the behaviors until an \"infected\" carrier makes personal contact. Finally, thesocial/economic level of the environment may unwittingly reinforce and institu- tionalize destructive values and damaging behavior. For example, schools mayallow some children to bully or attack others. In factories, managers may makesexual advances on subordinates, unless the organization or the community en-forces policies with punishments to forbid this. Or, a community police forcemay enforce alcohol, illegal drug, or reckless driving laws only some of the time,or only against poorer youth. Further, consumerism and materialism lure peo-ple of all ages into believing that well-being and happiness are just one morepurchase away. People who go that route to boost their low self-esteem may wellbankrupt their families' economic future, or even steal to get the money, to buyunrealistic and momentary \"satisfaction.\" Even as the environment's psychosocial and cultural/ideological strata can spread and encourage problem behaviors, so must the work be done within, to changethese environments and promote good health for the total person, family, andcommunity. The following section deals with that work. CONVEYING LEARNING AND VALUES TO OVERCOME HEALTH VULNERABILITIES How, then, can rational, emotional, valuing, and conduct skills, which are so necessary to healthy adults, be absorbed by youth? This has been a key question 95 ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS 15-24 YEARS OLD51331_p097_126_r1 4/7/03 3:14 PM Page 95that has preoccupied parents in early tribes and prehistoric civilizations, as well as parents of today and parents of tomorrow. Perhaps ancient cultures camecloser than we have to the answer; at least they were more sure of the answersthey taught. Today, in our pluralistic, multicultural world there are so many setsof values, ways of doing things, and standards of behavior that no matter whichis chosen, the parental generation is less certain which one is correct, and theyounger generation is less sure the other is wrong. Furthermore, cultures andtheir ways of living and thinking now change much faster than ever before. The epidemiological triangle explored in the section \"Strategies for Identifying Causes\" in Chapter 2 gives clues about approaches that might be used to en-courage young people to build healthier, less troubled, more productive lives forthemselves. Young people, then, would be regarded as the \"host\"; the environ-ment, as before, would be multi-layered; and the \"agents\" could be of two types,either damaging or protective forces. 96 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHHOW TO DEVELOP SYSTEMATIC HEALTH PROGRAMS FOR YOUTH Protective agents and behaviors. Their advantages and rewards should be emphasized, as should the idea that these healthy behaviors are coming into style, that everyone will soon be thinking and acting in these ways. These are the adult things to do. Damaging agents and behaviors. Emphasize that although they may be momentarily exciting, in the long term they are, in a word, dumb. The best way for a young person toshow independence and personal power is by not going along with dumb, self-defeatingactions. The program should teach and publicize true information about the harmful out-comes of damaging agents. It is essential to not exaggerate, or the critical public\u2014theyouth\u2014will dismiss your whole message as biased. The \"hosts.\" The target audiences for attitude and behavior change are, in fact, many different subgroups. Prepare separate messages for each subgroup, considering varyingpsychosocial characteristics such as culture; education; place of residence; and attitude dif-ferences such as group-oriented, solitary, rebellious, apathetic, or cooperative tendencies. The environment. Send energizing, constructive messages through institutions and groups in the social environment that reach to and are accepted by the target groups.(Look at the list of twelve channels of communication in Chapter 12. Consider which ones can become \"vectors\" or transmitters of positive messages.) At the family and neighborhood level use the media to show and disseminate health-promoting, non-violent\u2014 nontoxic \u2014resources and activities. Promote those social events, spare-time recreation, and small informal groups of friendsthat share a family's positive ways of thinking and behaving. Parent groups alsocan work together toward such goals. Youth groups with a civic-betterment orreligious orientation usually provide an uplifting, health-enhancing environ-ment. Parents must keep in touch with what their children are doing, and withwhom, whether the children are at home or away, where oversight may be lax. (Also see Chapter 12.)51331_p097_126_r1 4/7/03 3:14 PM Page 96At a more individual level, schoolteachers, group leaders, and parents not only should talk about healthful living, but their lives should demonstrate it. Theycan be role models, encourage youth to join in, and praise and reward success-ful behavior patterns. Notice that teachingby telling people what to do, or what not todo, without living it oneself, often fails. Itmay even spark rebellious urges to behavein the opposite way. Many excellent books have been published recently on adolescent development, health mar keting, and self-directed behavior change. I nterested persons are urged to consult these sources during program planning. PROTECTIVE FACTOR: PROMOTE THE UNIVERSAL VACCINE Is education the universal vaccine? The amount of schooling youth receive has a powerful effect on their present and future health and life expectancy. We canonly guess at how and why this happens, but there is no guessing about the 97 ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS 15-24 YEARS OLDUSEFUL PRINCIPLES TAKEN FROM STUDIES OF YOUTH AND ADULT LEARNING WHICH HAVE CROSS-CULTURAL VALUE People learn more things, and learn more deeply, when they participate in the task, rather than simply being told about it. For example, a young woman will learn moreabout parenting by helping in a nursery school than by reading a book or seeing avideo about child development. People learn better in group settings where leaders and other group members \"model\" the desirable behaviors. Role-playing in realistic scenarios of interpersonal or value conflicts reaches deeper into the participant than hearing or reading stories having the same content. This helps boththe \"actors\" from the group and the observers. In Westernized schools and communities there is much competition, but rather little practice in cooperation. Having the group solve problems or complete tasks coopera-tively can help correct this imbalance. If youth and adult learners are allowed some flexibility in choosing the content of an assigned task, their motivation will be sustained, as they learn problem-solvingprocesses and acquire interpersonal skills. Learning principles, methods, and facts that are presented in the context of a realistic practical problem\u2014i.e., problem-based learning\u2014elicit a more integrated understand-ing and more skills than teaching from a theoretical or abstract perspective, or bymemorization. When teaching about any issue that may have multiple viewpoints, encourage both pro and con arguments to be aired. This not only teaches the position of the healthpromoter, but also allows participants to hear, discuss, and be \"inoculated\" againstcounterarguments from opponents of the health action. Rumors, doubts, and anxietiesneed to be dealt with openly and frankly. Cultural and subcultural differences are critical in leading people towardhealthy, productive, and lovingpersonal lives.51331_p097_126_r1 4/7/03 3:14 PM Page 97worldwide power of this effect on nearly all kinds of health outcomes. Without a doubt, increased lifetime income and increased social participation in main-stream community activities play a part. Therefore, encourage young people tocontinue their full-time school for as long as is customary for the middle-class intheir community. For economic reasons, this may entail fewer years in develop-ing countries or poor areas than in economically better off areas. There is some-thing about formal schooling, even in job-skill curricula, that improves healththroughout the life cycle. Compared to adults who had had more years of schooling, adults in the United States who had completed 12 or fewer years of schooling: 1 had higher total age-adjusted death rates; had twice the age-adjusted chronic disease death rate; had two to three times the death rates due to injuries; had higher death rates due to infectious diseases; were twice as likely to die of HIV-AIDS; had 1.8 to 3.7 times the rate of suicide; were more likely to report \"heavy alcohol use\"; were more likely to smoke cigarettes; were more likely to be overweight by a ratio of about 2 to 1, although theseratios are changing in light of the current unhealthy weight-gain epidemic inthe country; were more likely to have sedentary lifestyles; and experienced more avoidable hospitalizations. In a Middle East nation, babies of women with some primary education sustain more than double the infant mortality rates as women who completed second-ary school or more. This mortality gradient by mother's education remainsequally strong for children through age 5 years. Many nations in the Americasshow equivalent trends. 98 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH1Data derived from United States Public Health Service reports on social inequalities in adult health. Similar data have been reported for many of these indicators from the United Kingdom.51331_p097_126_r1 4/7/03 3:14 PM Page 98Why does added schooling confer such strong and widely different health ben- efits? It does not appear to be the result of the few hours of health education in-cluded in some curricula for teenagers. The adage, \"Every year of learning addsto later years more earning\" can, in part, be traced to the following: More experience in thinking through problems completely; Exposure to a wider range of possible solutions to problems and more help-ful resources\u2014in other words, more choices; The ability to include a future dimension when considering outcomes oftoday's actions; Development of a sense of responsibility and \"self-efficacy\"\u2014a sense that \"I can change things, or save things in my life, that I am not a passive pawn offate\"; Supervised practice in interpersonal skills such as cooperative work, angercontrol, negotiating skills, winning and losing; All day interaction with a peer group in an adult-led environment wherethere is reasonably adequate (or better than that) control of the transmissionof values, content, objectives, and reinforcement of these. Higher incomes also are associated with better health, but the income effect on health seems to follow the education effect. Education occurs first. Of course,education and economic levels are two sides of the same coin. Economicallyadvantaged families see that their childrenget more formal education. And, youngpeople with more education obtain thekind of work that pays more money. An-other partial explanation is that more edu-cation raises self-esteem, a sense of personalworth, the feeling that one can overcomefate or chance, that one has the knowledgeabout how to stay healthy and the skillsand judgment to avoid injuries and vio-lence, as well as the cognitive tools to keeplearning more. Longer schooling also in-creases the strength of friendships and the range of one's social network\u2014con-tacts that can be helpful during adult life. Emphasizing the schooling of girlsand young women brings these fruits of education not only to them, but also tothe infants and children they will bear and care for. 99 ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS 15-24 YEARS OLDThe health sector and the education sector need to work together more ofthe time and with more enthusiasm.What is exciting is that better healthmakes better learning possible, andmore education brings with it betterhealth.

In certain cultural settings some problems may not be relevant, or it may not be economically possible to correct them. Dietary Practice Are meals eaten regularly according to local custom and are meals shared with otherpeople (for biological as well as psychological and social benefits.) Daily Food Intake Does daily food intake include adequate amounts of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, andprotein sources? Daily Unhealthful Food Intake Does daily intake restrict the amount of saturated fats, salt, refined sugars, and \"junkfood\" (i.e., recreational foods lacking in essential nutrients)? \"Dieting\" Behavior Does the person or group engage in exaggerated dieting so as to cause unhealthy weightloss or malnourishment? Are there any signs of eating disorders? Does the person everfast for more than 24 hours? Does the person vomit to help lose weight? Caloric Intake and Exercise Is there an imbalance between caloric intake and exercise utilization of calories such thatobesity is developing? Obesity in children and young people is now an epidemic in indus-trialized nations. Exercise Does the person or group engage in sufficient daily physical exertion at work, school, orelsewhere so as to increase aerobic fitness for cardiovascular, respiratory, and muscu-loskeletal systems? Adequate aerobic exercise involves sufficient activity to make onebreathe harder and increase heart rate for 25-35 minutes, repeated regularly 3 or 4 timesper week. Is this maintained even during seasons of inclement weather? Tobacco Use Family and peer group usage is the strongest predictor for individual use. Is the person ex-posed to groups where smoking or use of smokeless tobacco is the norm? If so, can thefamily habits be changed, or can the person spend more time with nonsmoking peers?Does the individual use tobacco? What forms? How frequently? much per day? Askboth for smoking and smokeless tobaccos (a major cause of oral cancer). Alcohol Use Ask about alcohol use, including binge drinking, in the peer group. In some groups, week-ends are the time to drink until passing out or losing control. Involvement with suchgroups is one major individual risk factor. Persons are more likely to answer accuratelyabout their groups than about themselves. For the latter use a tested set of questions likethe CAGE questionnaire listed below (Ewing, 1984, plus recent reviews). Have you ever felt the need to Cut down on your alcohol drinking? Have you ever felt Annoyed by criticism of your drinking? Do you ever feel Guilty about drinking? Did you ever take a drink first thing in the morning\u2014an \" Eye opener\"? These questions are usually asked orally, later in an interview. Straight \"Yes\" answers are less frequent than \"partial positives,\" such as \"partly, occasionally, a little.\" The format\"have you ever\" will also elicit positive responses from past drinkers and recovering alco-holics who no longer have the problem.51331_p097_126_r1 4/7/03 3:14 PM Page 100101 ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS 15-24 YEARS OLDAdditional useful screening questions include: About how many days in the past 30 days did you have an alcoholic drink? How often do you have five or more drinks within a fewhours? (See also the pertinent item in the \"Screening Checklist\" in Chapter 5.) Use of Other Mood-altering Substances This, too, is a sensitive matter. Usually, good rapport or a sense of trust with the subject isnecessary to obtain a \"straight answer.\" One approach is to ask: Do any of the peopleyou spend time with ever take pills, or drinks, or smoke or inject things to make them feelbetter, more excited, more calmed, or just to get away from boredom? Positive responsesor requests for clarification or examples can be pursued. Sharing hypodermic needles is amark of advanced drug abuse as well as risk of HIV. Then the questions can be shifted tothe respondent. For example, \"And which of these do you do too?\" \"How often?\" Again,peer group usage is the main risk factor, and perhaps even a subclinical indicator, of per-sonal use or of high chances of starting use. Sexual History An individual may engage in sexual relations with persons of either sex or with both sexes. Taboos on sex and its discussion lead young people especially to use local slang forparticular anatomy and actions. Be sure the interviewer fully knows and understands thelocal glossary. It may differ by age groups. \"Having sex\" means different things to differ-ent folks. Again, rapport and trust are critical to obtaining better information. A nonjudg-mental approach using open-ended questions, such as at first asking \"what else?\" maywork best initially. This can then be followed by specific, direct questions to \"pick up looseends.\" Always, consider both denials and acknowledgements only as approximations tothe truth. Find out whether the person has ever had a \"sexual experience.\" What did thatinvolve? What activities did the person engage in during the last six months? About howmany partners has the person had so far?\u2014many partners could be a strong clue to riskof sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Was STI protection used? All the time? (Also see section \"Unsafe Sex\" in Chapter 13.) Pregnancy Prevention Unwanted pregnancies are all too common in youth, especially as cultural and family re-strictions on sexual behavior become looser or are ignored. This process has been speededby young persons migrating away from their families for jobs. Unwanted pregnanciesoccur throughout the fertile years, including among married couples who already have asmany children as they desire or can support economically. Family planning (control overpregnancy) is valuable for all these people, including its use to space pregnancies at leasttwo years apart for the health of all concerned. Extended breastfeeding delays the return of fertility and menstrual periods, but it is not a reliable way to prevent pregnancy. Contraceptives prevent the start of a pregnancy withgreater certainty, but only avoiding sexual intercourse entirely is 100% effective. Oral contraceptives (either containing progestin alone or combined with estrogen) can be injected, implanted under the skin, or taken orally (one every day). The injected and sub-dermal implants are about 99% effective. The effectiveness of the oral pill also reaches99% when used correctly and consistently. The failure rate rises when usage is less thanoptimal. Each of the hormonal contraceptive methods brings a small risk of side-effectswhich need to be monitored, with consideration for changing the prescription (UnitedStates Preventive Services Task Force, 1996). (Box continues on next page)51331_p097_126_r1 4/7/03 3:14 PM Page 101102 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHCondoms have a failure rate of 3% when used correctly every time, but in fact, they have about a 15% failure rate among average users. Other barrier protection methods,such as diaphragms, have a failure rate of 6% under the best circumstances, but about20% in average population circumstances. Cervical caps have similar protective effective-ness. Keep in mind that many contraceptive methods provide no protection against sexu-ally transmitted diseases, and that some barrier methods which prevent infection have toohigh a failure rate for dependable pregnancy prevention. The United States Preventive Services Task Force's Guide to Clinical Preventive Services (1996) recommends periodic counseling both about contraceptive methods and preven-tion of sexually transmitted infections for all sexually active women and men. Nations with family planning priorities have programs and materials in place to move toward suchgoals. Matters of contraception are influenced by culture, belief, family circumstances, andpersonal factors. Consequently, they need to be worked out individually between awoman or a couple and the clinician. Sexual Risk Behaviors Seven major risk factors for sexual infections are: Activities allowing exchange of genital or anal fluids or contact with blood without bar- rier protection (e.g., a condom). Fluids such as tears and perspiration are safe. Activities exposing skin or oral, anal, or genital mucosa (especially if abraded or broken) to body fluids, sores, rashes, warts, or possible parasites. Anal penetration is very dangerous both to the passive and the active partner. The rectal area is an incubator for many pathogens. Having multiple partners over time multiplies risk of infection. Having partners who themselves have multiple partners (including sex workers). Having unprotected sex with a stranger (or even a friend!) exposes one to the diseases that person's partners have. Using alcohol or drugs to the extent of impaired judgment in settings where the person might become vulnerable to the sexual risks above. Persons engaging in unsafe sexual practices or those with a history of sexually transmitted diseases may benefit from testing for gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, and HIV, as well asbehavioral modification to reduce future risks. (See also the section on \"Unsafe Sex\" in Chapter 13.) Risks of Motor Vehicle Trauma or Injury The following questions will help determine the level of risk of motor vehicle trauma or in-jury. (For a more comprehensive review, see Chapter 11.) Does the person ever ride with drivers who have just drunk alcohol? Does the person ever drive after consuming alcohol? Has the person or any friends recently been charged with traffic violations (a predictor of a future injurious crash)? Has the person or a friend had a vehicle \"accident\" (depending on circumstances it might predict future mishaps)? Does the person ride motorcycles or motor scooters without a helmet? Falls are in- evitable, and risks of permanent disability, especially neurological, are great. Does the person ride in autos or trucks without using seat belts?SCREENING CHECKLIST FOR AGES 15 TO 24 YEARS: BY INTERVIEW AND OBSERVATION (continued)51331_p097_126_r1 4/7/03 3:14 PM Page 102103 ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS 15-24 YEARS OLDRisks of Occupational Injury Ask the following questions: Does the person work with machinery similar to that on which other workers have been injured from time to time? Can the problem be reduced by protective changes inmachinery? Can protective gear or garments be distributed to workers? Can workers beretrained or trained differently? (The work group's recent experience is a good predictorfor future individual risk.) Is the worker exposed to dust, chemicals, or biological agents that can accumulate acutely or chronically to impair health? Does the worker do heavy lifting or engage in labor that involves twisting or maintain- ing a poor posture for hours? These are all common causes of musculoskeletal injuryand disability, which may be largely prevented by worker training or re-engineering ofwork tasks. Risks of Home and Leisure Trauma Find out about the following issues. Ask about hobby and recreation activities. Home workshops or farm plots may involve the risky use of power machinery, paint, solvents, or pesticides. Check for safety habits,including eye, hand, and inhalation protection. Does the person like to \"take risks\" in daily activities or competitions? Does the person race motorcycles or cars? Try to get as specific an answer as possible. Risks of Injury from Violence Get answers for the following questions. Does the person (especially if male) spend time with groups or in places where argu- ments, fights, or violence occur? Where street drugs are sold or used? Does the person belong to a gang or a group to help protect himself/herself from other people or gangs? Does the person or friends carry knives, clubs, guns, or other weapons to protect themselves? How often in the past year has the person been involved in a physical fight? How often has the person been threatened or attacked while at school or at work, or while traveling to or from such places? Has the person been hit or hurt by a boyfriend or girlfriend? (Young women are at particularly high risk from men they date, as well as from family members.) Has the person been forced into any kind of sexual behavior against his or her will, including sexual assault, rape, and related trauma? Was this an isolated incident or arepeated occurrence? (See also the section on \"Special Issues for Women\" in Chapter 5 and see Chapter 11). Social Supports Find out if the person lives in a stable household. Are household members, or other familyor friends, able and willing to help the person if injury, illness, loss of job, or other life cri-sis occurs? Are both practical assistance and emotional acceptance readily available? Sleep Habits Does the person usually get an adequate amount of quality sleep? Young adults typicallyshort-change themselves on sleep, and this can lead to reduced immune function, mentaljudgment, and motor coordination, as well as long-term effects on the cardiovascular system.

Young women must be im-munized against rubella before entering childbearing years. Both genders should receivebooster shots for diphtheria and tetanus every ten years. Signs of Physical Abuse Young women are at particular risk of physical or sexual abuse. Ask about it sensitively butdirectly. Look for signs of new or old injury to the face, hands, and arms. If a physicalexamination is done, look for bruises, cuts, or burns on the back, buttocks, breast, abdo-men, and genitalia. (For specific guidance on how to do this, see Aciero, Resnick, andKilpatrick, 1997.) Sunburn Urge fair-skinned persons to avoid skin exposure to mid-day sun and to use creams thatblock ultraviolet light. Three instances of severe sunburn, especially if blistering results,constitute a risk factor for malignant melanoma\u2014a usually fatal skin cancer. For personswith much exposure to sunlight, look for malignant skin lesions. (See also pertinent sec- tion in Chapter 9.) Mood Disorders Adolescents and young adults are at higher risk for depression, suicide, and anxiety disor-ders. Groups can be screened by standardized questionnaires. With individuals, such prob-lems can also be estimated by direct observation and interview. These mood reactions mayeither be generated by fluctuations in brain chemistry or by life crises, particularly the lossof a loved one, defeats, or perceived damage to one's self-worth. (See also Chapters 7 and 11.) Reassure the interviewee that many people have \"ups\" and \"downs\" (using local idioms for pleasures and troubles), then proceed with questions such as \"How has it been for you?\"\"Have you had big changes to deal with?\" \"Have re-cently) felt so sad or troubled that you stopped doing some of the things you ordinarily liketo do?\" \"How long did this last?\" \"As you look ahead a year or so from now, do you thinkthings will be better? Worse? The same?\" (\"Worse\" may be a clue to hopelessness.) There are also standard brief questionnaires that can be used as screening instruments to assess general mental health, anxiety, or depression in groups. A \"general well-beingscale\" also can be used, and then followed up with interviews with low scorers. 2None of these scales is diagnostic of any condition and they can be answered falsely. They are use-ful as a quick screen, however. Family Issues Find out if the person is responsible for the health or well-being of children or other de-pendents. If so, review with them the screening checklists for those age groups that areincluded in this handbook's pertinent chapters.SCREENING CHECKLIST FOR AGES 15 TO 24 YEARS: BY INTERVIEW AND OBSERVATION (continued) 2See Ware, Johnston, and Davies-Avery, 1979, and in Bradburn, 1969, for several examples of scales, one of which is still widely used.51331_p097_126_r1 4/7/03 3:14 PM Page 104105 ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS 15-24 YEARS OLDIs education the \"universal vaccine\" for the 21st century? Not totally, of course, but its widespread health advances have been sufficiently documented aroundthe world. Indeed, we can achieve sizeable health benefits in the intermediate tolong-term by believing\u2014at least part of the time\u2014that education is the univer-sal vaccine. A SCREENING QUESTIONNAIRE The \"Youth Risk Behavior Survey,\" which is available from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,3is a well established system for asking about behaviors that greatly influence health in adolescents and young people. Theself-administered survey form includes questions targeted mainly to middle-classchildren and youth in the United States, most of whom attend school and arefamiliar with such questionnaires. The questions will need to be adapted for usein other cultures or languages. The section below summarizes the survey according to major topics of inquiry. A few widely applicable types of questions will be listed under each topic whereappropriate. In clinical situations, an interview with a health professional or a trusted neu- tral person who develops rapport with a youth will generate more reliable datathan a self-administered questionnaire. Another approach is to lead a smallgroup of ten or fewer persons in answering the questions, perhaps reading someof the more difficult items. When questionnaires such as this\u2014which ask forpersonal and sensitive information\u2014are administered to large groups, youngpeople often react by inciting one another to give false or frivolous answers. INQUIRY TOPICS FROM THE \"YOUTH RISK BEHAVIOR SURVEY\" 1. Individual Personal Information. This includes age, gender, year in school, height, weight information. 2. Vehicle Safety. Use of helmets on motorbikes and bicycles, seat belts in autos and trucks. Use of alcohol by drivers. (See the section on risks of motor vehicle trauma or injury in Chapters 4 and 5; the sectionon alcohol abuse and dependence in Chapter 7; and the section onmotor vehicle injuries in Chapter 11.) 3. Risk of Violence. Missing school or work from fear of assault. Carrying weapons such as knives, clubs, or guns. How often does the person feel 3http://www.cdc.gov/needphp/dash/survey99.html51331_p097_126_r1 4/7/03 3:14 PM Page 105106 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHthreatened? How often is the person involved in a physical fight? Has the person been slapped, hit, or attacked by a boyfriend or girlfriend? Has theperson been forced into sexual activity against his or her will? (See rele- vant items in the \"Screening Checklist\" in 4; the sections on\"Special Issues for Women\" and \"Special Issues for Men\" in Chapter5; and the section on \"Suicide and Violence\" in Chapter 11.) 4. Depression and Suicide. During the past year, has the person felt sad or hopeless for two weeks or more? Has the person recently felt that life is notworth living? If the answer is \"yes,\" then ask, Has the person consideredsuicide or planned to kill him- or herself? (See the section on \"Major Health Problems\" and relevant items in the \"Screening Checklist\" inChapter 4; the sections on \"Recognizing and Dealing with Depres-sion\" and \"Suicide and Violence\" in Chapter 7.) 5. Tobacco Use. (This topic covers both smoking and chewing tobacco or snuff.) How many days has the person smoked in the past 30 days? Onaverage, how many cigarettes has the person smoked or how many timeshas the person used other forms of tobacco per day? (See the subsection on tobacco use in the section on \"Risk Behaviors\" and pertinentitem in the \"Screening Checklist\" in pertinent portions insection on \"Head Neck Cancers\" in Chapter 9; and section on\"Tobacco Use\" in Chapter 13.) 6. Alcohol Abuse. How many days in the last 30 days has the person had a drink containing alcohol? Use local names for such drinks, and cover beer,wine, and distilled liquor. How often has the person had more than fivealcoholic drinks within a few hours? (See the section on \"Pregnancy\" in Chapter 3; pertinent text in section on \"Risk Behaviors\" and perti-nent items in \"Screening Checklist\" items in\"Screening Checklist\" in Chapter 5; section on \"Alcohol Abuse and De-pendence\" in Chapter 7; and section on \"Alcohol Use\" in Chapter 13.) 7. Use of Marijuana. After developing trust with the person being inter- viewed, ask how frequently the person has used marijuana in the last 30days and how much. When did the person last use marijuana? (See perti- nent text in the section on \"Risk and pertinent items inthe \"Screening Checklist\" in Chapter 4; and pertinent item in the\"Screening Checklist\" in Chapter 5.) 8. Use of Other Mind-altering Drugs. Drugs in this entry include heroin, amphetamines and other \"uppers,\" cocaine and its derivatives, inhalants,steroids without prescription, strong pain medication such as morphine andother \"downers,\" hallucinogens, and new designer drugs such as Ecstasy.Ask such questions as \"Have you ever used ______ (identify the drug by its51331_p097_126_r1 4/7/03 3:14 PM Page 106107 ADOLESCENTS AND YEARS OLDlocal name)? How recently? How often? How did it affect your mind? Your body? How often have you injected something into your body by a needle?(never, one to five times, more than 5 times).\" (See pertinent text in sec- tion on \"Risk Behaviors\" in Chapter 4; pertinent item in the \"Screen-ing Checklist\" in Chapter 5; pertinent text in the section on \"ElevenCrossroads where Risk and Protective Factors Meet\" in Chapter 7;and Table 13.1 in Chapter 13.) 9. Sexual Risks. Because sexual issues are considered shameful or secret in most cultures, each group develops its own slang or group language to talk about sexual organs and actions. Be sure to use local wording when asking for information. Ask especially about possible exchange of body fluids (especially genital secretions orblood); skin contact with sores, pim-ples, or aboutthe approximate number of partnersthe person has had in the last year. Ask for history of sexually transmitted in-fections (STIs) and pregnancies. Askabout methods used to prevent STIsand pregnancies. How consistently werethese used? (See pertinent text in section on \"Risk Behaviors\" per- tinent items pertinent 5; and section on \"Unsafe Sex\" inChapter 13.) 10. Body Weight. This topic deals with preventing obesity, the risk of excessive weight loss by dieting and purging, and the risk of anorexia nervosa and bu-limia. (See pertinent text in section on \"Risk Behaviors\" in Chapter 4.) 11. Nutrition. Promote the consumption of vegetables, salads, fruits and fruit juices, whole grains, and milk products, so that they comprise much of the person's regular diet. Find out how frequently junk foods and junkdrinks\u2014whose calories come mostly from fats, sugars, or alcohol\u2014are con-sumed. Discourage their consumption. (See pertinent text in section on \"Children 5 through 14 Years\" in Chapter 3; pertinent items in\"Screening Checklist\" in Chapter 4; pertinent item in the \"ScreeningChecklist\" in Chapter 5; and section on \"Malnutrition and Hunger\"in Chapter 13.) 12. Physical Activity. This topic gathers information about frequency of vig- orous exercise (causing sweat and hard breathing), milder exercise (such aswalking or housework), strength building exercise, participation in sportsteams, and hours spent sitting during an average weekday (a summary in-The World Bank lists illicit drug use as the eighth leading cause of death in industrial countries and the tenth in developing regions. It also ranks as the eighth leading cause ofdisability in industrial countries andninth in developing regions.51331_p097_126_r1 4/7/03 3:14 PM Page 107dicator of sedentary lifestyle). (See relevant text in section on \"Risk Be- haviors\" and relevant items in the \"Screening Checklist\" in Chapter4 and in the \"Screening Checklist\" in Chapter 5.) 13. AIDS. The survey asks only one question on this topic: \"Have you ever been taught about AIDS or HIV infection in school?\" There are manyother ways to learn about AIDS. The key issue, however, is consistent useof safer sexual practices. Young people 15-24 years old are poised at the early middle of their life cycle. They carry with them health assets and deficiencies acquired during gestationand childhood. And in their teens and twenties they will also accumulate furtherrisks and benefits, strengths and damages that will persist into the rest of theirlives. Their risk behaviors either accumulate and are remodeled or stopped overyears of experience. A human life, much as the life of a tree, shows growth ringsthat reveal sequences of good and bad years. There can be damaging years ofdrought and there can be boon years of nurtured growth. Each season of life isimportant and presents the opportunity to build better health. Make the best ofeach one. 108 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p097_126_r1 4/7/03 3:14 PM Page 1085. The Prime of Life: Ages 25-64 Years In this wide window in a human's lifespan, some have argued that there really are two stages involved\u2014a younger and an older stage. The two stages sharesuch vital common features, however, that this book will deal with them in asingle chapter. People between ages 25 and 64 years are the community's \"machinery.\" They propel and steer the economy and provide direction for the community'slifestyle and future. They are the community's decision-makers and key moversin developing and attaining social and health improvements in their localities.Many persons in their prime of life are parenting children, doing the family'swork, earning the money and acquiring the goods needed to care for depen-dents, participating in organizations, and being neighbors. By age 50, many alsobegin to care for aging parents, becoming responsible for their shelter, personalcare, or economic help. Indeed, these prime years are the most productive ones for most people, and so, this generation needs vital good health to carry out its social and economic tasksin the community, especially where the median age is very young. In those cir-cumstances this relatively small fraction of the population must support a largeraggregate of young dependents and, increasingly, of older dependents as well. Preventive medicine goals for this age span include preventing injury and dis- ability and postponing or preventing chronic degenerative diseases. Successfulpromotion of health at these ages is the foundation for the economic develop-ment of communities and nations. THE GROWING IMPORTANCE OF ADULT HEALTH Throughout the last century, public health efforts have been remarkably suc-cessful in reducing disease, disability, and death among infants and children.This success has meant that in developing countries, 85% of children live totheir fifth birthday, and in fully industrialized countries, nearly 99% of them do(Feachem et al. (eds.), 1992). As a consequence of these gains in infant andchild mortality, the population of adults older than 15 years old is growing rap-idly, especially in developing regions\u2014developing nations were home to 2.05billion adults in 1985, with increases each subsequent year. 109 THE PRIME OF LIFE: AGES 25-64 YEARS51331_p127_147_r1 4/7/03 2:22 PM Page 109The World Bank has compiled data on survival rates for nearly 200 nations and geographicunits (Feachem et al. (eds.), 1992), and that in-stitution's statisticians have developed and cross-validated models to estimate the probabilities oflive-born babies to die before age 5 and of youth15 years old to die before age 65 years. Table 5.1shows the probability of death between the agesof 15 and 64 years, by gender, for six aggrega-tions of nations and reporting areas at all stagesof economic development. 1(Only data from the 169 national units with mortality data from1980 and later were used in the table.) The differences in probability of survival at each of these life stages are surprisingly large between sexes and across aggregationsof nations. Differences appear to be due largely to environment, which wouldsuggest that a large portion of the inequalities\u2014and of the inequities\u2014couldpotentially be remedied. 110 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH1For data on individual nations the reader is referred to the World Bank's 1992 report: The Health of Adults in the Developing World, or to subsequent updates of that publication.TABLE 5.1.

Improving adult health is more essential now than ever before because: there are now more adults in the world than ever before; adults are responsible for raising children and teaching them to becomehealthy and responsible citizens; and adults are society's \"economic engine,\" producing the resources to liftcommunities out of sickness and povertyinto health and greater overall life-satisfaction.51331_p127_147_r1 4/7/03 2:22 PM Page 110A striking observation about the large differences in the median chance of dying (between one's 15th and 65th birthdays) across the world's regions is that therank order of these differences closely mirrors the degree of economic develop-ment within each region. The second remarkable feature is the great range of values seen within each re- gion. For example, in the Asian-Pacific region there is a fourfold difference inthe percentages of men dying and a near eightfold range in chance of death forwomen, depending upon the area of residence: Hong Kong, for example, has by far the lowest rate in all the Asia-Pacific region. The industrialized\u2014read\"richer\"\u2014countries have the lowest mortality, followed by Latin America andEastern Europe. If we take a closer look at the Region of the Americas countries and reporting areas (Pan American Health Organization, 1994, pp. 8-19), the rank orderingof death rates at most age strata has a nearly perfectly linear negative correlationwith gross national product (GNP). In other words, each step of increase in eco-nomic production is accompanied by a step of decrease in age-specific mortal-ity rates throughout the life cycle. In the Americas, the major exception to thisrule is Cuba\u2014despite its relatively low GNP in terms of external currencies, thecountry has low mortality rates comparable to much richer nations. This maywell be the result of the high priority Cuba has given to universal health careand education. The gender differences in death rates across regions and reporting areas show a nearly universal excess of male deaths, and this is true not only for ages 15-64,but for other ages as well. Males have higher death rates than females at everyage from the prenatal period to the end of life. After infancy, the excess in malemortality is largely attributable to behavioral causes: risk-taking; fighting; vio-lence; greater alcohol, cigarette, and illegal drug use; occupational injuries anddiseases; less use of health care when needed; and inadequate self care. In the-ory, the male flight toward death could be subdued substantially by psycho-social, subcultural, and behavioral change. Could this ever happen? MAJOR CAUSES OF DEATH As younger adults enter the 25 to 64 year age range, they bring along the fullarray of risk factors and health problems they were exposed to while younger.For men, the rates of unintentional and intentional trauma, injury and disabil-ity, continue to hold sway until after age 35. Actually, external causes\u2014traumainflicted from outside the body\u2014remain the leading causes of both mortalityand disability for men until at least age 35 in most of the world's nations. Be-tween ages 35 and 65 years, cardiovascular disorders, cancers, and respiratorydiseases become the major causes of death and disability for men. For women 111 THE PRIME OF LIFE: AGES 25-64 YEARS51331_p127_147_r1 4/7/03 2:22 PM Page external causes, malignant neoplasms, and cardiovascular dis- orders are the leading causes of death, all with quite low and very similar rates.As one reviews statistics in the World Health Statistics Annual in the 1990s, these three causes almost always rank as the top three causes of death for women inindustrialized nations, although in no consistent order. In industrialized nations chronic diseases are responsible for about three-quarters of all deaths in both sexes. Cardiovascular diseases and cancers are the majorkillers of both men and women in the prime of life. Among those who smokecigarettes, tobacco-related diseases rise to prominence, and the cardiorespiratorydisability they cause also makes prognosis poorer for all other major diseases.Clinicians treating smokers should urge their patients to stop smoking. (Also see Chapters 12 and 13). They should also screen for risk factors and early signs of ischemic of the head, neck, bronchus, andlung (see Chapter 13 for a full list of tobacco-related diseases). Other common risk factors\u2014and each one of them contributes to various dis-orders\u2014are worth checking and correcting in adults. These include sedentarylifestyle, obesity, alcohol misuse or overuse, high blood lipid levels, and highblood pressure. In this age group, digestive cancers become more frequent clin-ically. In developed countries the most common cancer sites are lung for menand breast for women. CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES In developing countries, cardiovascular diseases also is the leading cause of deathfor both men and women in the prime of life. Cancers and infectious and para-sitic diseases rank second and third for women, and third and second for men.In 1990, tuberculosis accounted for the majority of infectious deaths, estimatedat 586,000 in men and 320,000 in women 30 to 59 years old annually in de-veloping countries. Among cancer deaths, cancers of the cervix and breast weremost common in women, and cancers of the liver and lung in men. Uninten-tional and intentional injuries were major killers in men, together accounting forabout 775,000 deaths in 1990 in the defined groups (Murray and Lopez, 1996). Cardiovascular diseases in the prime of life differ in industrialized and in devel- oping countries. In the former\u2014in post-industrialized and sedentary coun-tries\u2014they tend to be mostly ischemia caused by atherosclerosis; but in most de-veloping nations, diseases of pulmonary circulation, cardiomyopathy, sequellaeof rheumatic heart disease (including heart valve damage), inflammations, and\"other cardiovascular\" disorders predominate. As people in developing countriesincrease their cigarette smoking and add more saturated fats to their diet, ather-osclerotic diseases will increase. By the same token, as developing countries re- 112 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p127_147_r1 4/7/03 2:22 PM Page 112duce the incidence of those infectious and parasitic diseases that affect the heart and reduce the contributors to pulmonary hypertension, the burden of non-atherosclerotic cardiac diseases will decrease. (Also see Chapter 8.) TUBERCULOSIS T uberculosis (TB) is becoming epidemic again, especially in developing coun-tries. The highest TB death rates occur between the ages of 30 and 59 years, ac-counting for nearly half (46%) of the nearly two million TB deaths each year(Murray and Lopez, 1996). The tubercle bacillus, while required for diagnosingthis disease, is by no means a sufficient cause. In some economically advantagedareas only 1% or 2% of infected people (diagnosed by PPD skin test) becomeclinically ill in the next decade. Yet, in some disadvantaged areas more than 50%of infected persons may become clinically ill. Clearly, tuberculosis as a cause ofdisability and death unleashes its full force in those localities that have inadequatesanitation and public health programs\u2014places where people live in crowded,substandard housing, work under unhealthy conditions, and have poor nutrition.Professor George Comstock (in Last, 1986) calls tuberculosis \"to some degree abarometer of social welfare.\" In industrial nations, TB also is on the rise again, es-pecially among the poor, homeless, and poorly nourished, as well as among thosewith impaired immune function. For example, about one-third of HIV cases inthe world are expected to have tuberculosis listed as their final cause of death. The main reasons for the worldwide resurgence in TB appear to be: reduced lev- els of public health attack on the disease by screening (by skin test, chest X-rays,or sputum culture, depending on circumstances); failure to treat active casespromptly with antibiotics (thus permittingthe infection to spread); and failure to dealwith the great increases in susceptibilitycaused by poverty and malnutrition. TB takes a greater toll on men. Moreover, because it strikes early in life, with elevateddeath rates from age 15 onward, TB can in-flict greater damage on developing commu-nities than can chronic diseases whose im-pact becomes serious only after about age50. TB is ranked as the sixth leading causeof loss of healthy life-years (DALYs) in the developing world for 1990\u201418.5million per year for ages 15-59 years only and nearly 40 million for the entireage span. No improvement is projected through the year 2010. T reatment with antibiotics stops the advancement of TB in the patient and also greatly reduces the chance of the disease spreading to others. It is one of the 113 THE PRIME OF LIFE: AGES 25-64 YEARSThe main reasons for the worldwide resurgence in TB appear to be: reducedlevels of public health attack on thedisease by screening; failure to treatactive cases promptly with antibiotics;and failure to deal with the greatincreases in susceptibility caused bypoverty and malnutrition.51331_p127_147_r1 4/7/03 2:22 PM Page 113most cost-effective public health interventions, costing only $3 to $7 per year of disability or lost life prevented. Given the cost of TB, starting with two mil-lion lives per year plus uncounted disability, lost production, broken families,etc., a much higher priority should be given to its prevention. MAJOR CAUSES OF DISABILITY Women and men experience quite similar durations of disability as a proportionof their average life spans. Worldwide, however, differences are substantial, andthey are linked to economic development. People in established market econo-mies live about 8% of their lives disabled; in Latin America and the Caribbean,the figure rises to about 12%; and in Sub Saharan Africa, it is about 15%, eventhough they die much earlier on average (Murray and Lopez, 1997). The causes of disability differ substantially from the causes of death in the \"mid- dle years.\" Table 5.2 lists the rate of DALYs per 1,000 population for ages 15 to59 years, for men and women, in two geo-economic regions: highly industrial-ized market economies and Latin America and the Caribbean, with its mix ofdeveloping and market economies and tropical and temperate climates.

Established market economies includes nations in Northern and Western Europe and Canada, the UnitedStates of America, Australia, and New Zealand; former socialist republics are not included. Latin America and theCaribbean includes all of the Region of the Americas south of Canada and the United States of America. Someof the Latin American and Caribbean nations are advanced in development, but included here.51331_p127_147_r1 4/7/03 2:22 PM Page 114Latin American and Caribbean region was not chosen as an \"opposite\" to the established market economies. Rather, it was chosen because it is a region intransition, shifting economically, socially, and epidemiologically toward what isnow considered full development. The table presents data for ages 15-59 ratherthan for the age group 25-64 years old, as is done everywhere else in this chap-ter, because data for the latter age group was not readily available. The top reasons for loss of healthy life years for men and women in established market economies and in Latin America and the Caribbean are neuropsychiatricconditions. This broad category includes unipolar major depression, bipolar dis-order (formerly manic depressive psychosis), schizophrenia, alcohol abuse oraddiction, drug abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorders, as well as the more neurological disorders of dementia (atall ages), Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. Neuropsychiatric conditions account for more health loss among both men and women 15-59 years old than any other diagnostic category. According to theGBD Study, this holds both for worldwide data and for six of the eight separateregions covered (established market economies, India, China, Southeast Asiaand Pacific Islands, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Middle Eastern Cres-cent). In the former socialist economies, neuropsychiatric causes account formost DALYs in women, but rank second to unintentional injuries in men inthese ages. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the leading causes of lost health in adults areinfectious and parasitic diseases, intentional and unintentional injuries (in thatorder in men); and infections, parasites, and problems of pregnancy and deliv-ery in women. The most common and damaging specific psychiatric condition worldwide is unipolar major depression. Women are particularly hard hit. In some placesalcohol abuse ranks first for men, but unipolar depression is always a majorproblem. Overall, combining genders and all ages, the ranking of neuropsychi-atric conditions by years of health lost is as follows: unipolar depression, alco-hol abuse, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and dementia. Each of these (insequence) subtracts between 50.8 million to 8.5 million healthy life years (esti-mated DALYs) from the total world experience each year. The magnitude ofthese figures gives added priority for research and prevention of depression. (Also see Chapter 7.) The second and subsequent causes of lost health differ in men and women aged15-59. For women in developed nations, malignant neoplasms rank second.The reasons for this are twofold\u2014on the one hand, other major health riskshave been brought under better control; on the other, clinic facilities that candiagnose malignancies are widely available. In transitioning and developing na-tions, as exemplified by Latin American and Caribbean nations, cardiovascular 115 THE PRIME OF LIFE: AGES 25-64 YEARS51331_p127_147_r1 4/7/03 2:22 PM Page 115and maternal problems, malignancies, and unintended injuries all account for at least 10 DALYs per year per 1,000 population aged 15-59 years old. Clearly,the major causes of death and disability overlap in some categories, but differ inothers. Both outcomes must be taken into account when planning preventivehealth programs. SPECIAL ISSUES FOR WOMEN Family violence is a major preventable cause of nonfatal injury in women inthese decades of life. This burden of disease is greater in developing countrieswhere male dominance holds sway. Physical and sexual abuse do damage wellbeyond what emergency clinics can treat. In addition to the bruises, internalbleeding, and musculoskeletal harm the victim sustains immediately, interna-tional research has now demonstrated that episodes of abuse give birth to long-lasting physical illness complexes, often in the gastrointestinal or genitourinarysystems (Acierno, et al., 1997 and Resnick, et al., 1997). Experiencing violence,even the threat of violence, can plant the seeds for post-traumatic stress syn-drome, chronic fears, and depression. Men who are violent with their wives orpartners often also bully and attack their children. (Also see the section on \"Child Abuse and Neglect\" in Chapter 3.) Sadly, women appear to be at an especially high-risk for assault injuries when they are pregnant. The American Psychologist devoted its 1999 January issue to a review of the prevalences of domestic violence and the shelter and treatment programs world-wide. The issue, which includes information from Argentina, Chile, Greece,Israel, Japan, Nicaragua, Mexico (a demonstration project), Russia, and theUnited States of America, is a rich resource for agencies planning to establishpreventive programs. Reproductive health is a major issue for women throughout their childbearing years. Bearing too many children (some experts see four as the healthy maxi- mum), or bearing them with fewer than twoyears between pregnancies, has been proven tocreate serious health risks for the mother andher babies in many countries. (See pertinent text in section on \"Risk Behaviors\" in Chap-ter 4.) This means that a variety of effective family planning techniques should be madeavailable and accessible as part of primaryhealth care. The same program that teaches the woman about contraceptive use also should work with her partner, appealing tohim to opt for a few strong and healthy children rather than many unplannedchildren, at least some of which are likely to be sick or impaired. (Also see the section on \"In Pregnancy\" in Chapter 3.) 116 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHHealth promotion and care for women can have a multiplier effect when women are taught in a practical, experiential way how to preserve their health and that of their children, spouses, and older adults.51331_p127_147_r1 4/7/03 2:22 PM Page 116Women's disability caused by complications of pregnancy and delivery is pandemic in more slowly developing regions (as shown in Table 5.2). In Sub-Saharan Africa, India, and the Middle East Crescent, these maternal problemsaccount for 24%,19% and 28%, respectively, of all years of lost life or impairedhealth in women 15-44 years old. As more and more women enter the work-force each decade, occupational injuries and toxic exposures are becoming moresignificant the world over. Health promotion and care for women can have a multiplier effect when women are taught in a practical, experiential way about how to preserve their health andthat of their children, spouses, and older adults. This should be an ongoingprocess, which, if done in an interactive group setting, keeps teaching relevant,allows immediate clarification of uncertainties, and multiplies community dif-fusion of knowledge. SPECIAL ISSUES FOR MEN The onslaught of intentional and unintentional trauma expands to an everlarger proportion of total deaths as traditional infections get reduced. In devel-oped nations, injuries account for 22% of all deaths in men between 30 and 59years old and for 12% in women in those ages. In developing regions totalinjuries in 1990 accounted for 19% of men's deaths (775,000) and 9% ofwomen's. The largest proportion of all deaths attributable to injury (all ages,both sexes) occurs in China (11.5% of total deaths there). The cost to men in DALYs also is astounding. Worldwide, the GBD Study es- timates that about 28% of all healthy years lost by men aged 15-59 are causedby injuries. The injury burden suffered by men ages 15-44 is much higher pro-portionally than that suffered by older men. The greatest proportions of dis-abilities due to intentional and unintentional injuries occur in Sub-SaharanAfrica (41%), the former socialist republics (32%), and the Middle EasternCrescent (30%). In Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle Eastern Crescent, morethan half of injury disability is intentionally inflicted. War is the largest singlecomponent in the Middle Eastern Crescent, and organized violence outrankswar for the male burden in Sub-Saharan Africa. Even in fully industrializedcountries intentional injuries make up 30% of total injury disability.Without adoubt, this is a golden opportunity for socially meaningful prevention. Is the carnage from external causes a public health problem? Or, are the high percentages of disabilities inflicted intentionally? Certainly, the lost years of lifeand health are major public health problems. But economic disasters are not farbehind, when young adults, in whom 15 to 20 years of child rearing and edu-cating have been invested, lose part or all of their economically productive yearsto trauma. 117 THE PRIME OF LIFE: AGES 25-64 YEARS51331_p127_147_r1 4/7/03 2:22 PM Page 117What about the etiology? Who is working to identify the agents, the vectors, the environmental contributors to this pandemic? Table 5.2 shows that all injuries(combining unintentional trauma and violence/self-hurt) rank first and sec-ond\u2014right alongside neuropsychiatric disorders\u2014as a contributor to lost healthin the men who are the economic backbone of most communities in the world.In addition, the disabled who survive require professional and family care andresources, at considerable expense. Obviously, no conceivable vaccine can treat this public health pandemic of violence that onlythreatens to worsen. The GBD Study predictsthat by 2010, the total damage caused both byunintentional and by intentional injuries willincrease among men and women. Only serious,intense, resource-utilizing cooperation among major governmental sectors might begin to reverse this tide. Raising the level ofeducation already has a proven track record in reducing many kinds of healthand social problems; it may do the same for injuries. Improved motor vehiclesafety, too, can save lives and disability through enforcing traffic safety laws andmandatory use of seat belts, preventing persons who have drunk alcohol fromdriving, and removing structural hazards on roadways and at intersections(Evans, 1991, Chapter 13). Better worker training and the mandatory installa-tion and use of protective and safety gear is another approach for the workplace.Finally, studies can be undertaken about local trauma risks, to be followed byactions to reduce them. (Also see Chapter 11.) Steps can also be taken to curb intentional injuries, including self-inflictedwounds and suicide, violence against others. Heightened awareness of depres-sion and hopelessness by lay persons and professionals alike could help relievethe disability of depression. Referring a depressed person for medical help andaccompanying him or her to and from the treatment site can also help preventsuicide attempts. (Also see Chapters 7 and 11.) Hostility and aggression are the cultural diseases that lead to violence. Failure tovalue the lives and rights of others is a moral deficiency disease that multipliesthe destructive effect. Families, schools, religious and ethical organizations, busi-nesses, civic organizations, the media, and the government need to work to-gether and motivate each other to uproot and disown the culture of violence.Teaching non-aggressive problem-solving using mediation and negotiation,searching for solutions where both parties win, and teaching the sanctity ofhuman life can all reduce violence. Reducing despair may reduce emotionalpressure and give cognitive approaches a better chance. Violence often followsfrustration and desperation, but violent behavior is learned through interper-sonal and social experiences. Under the right circumstances, problem-solvingcan be learned instead. But for all these approaches to work, they must be taught 118 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHHostility and aggression are the cultural diseases that lead to violence. Failure to value the lives and rights of others is a moral deficiency disease that multiplies the destructive effect. 51331_p127_147_r1 4/7/03 2:22 PM Page 118in early childhood and modeled throughout the lifespan. The National Academy of Sciences in the United States prepared an integration of violence preventionliterature and recommendations (Reiss and Roth, 1993, Chapter 3). And, if we can learn to do this as individuals, as families, and as communities, perhaps\u2014just perhaps\u2014national and regional leaders can learn these skills too.That would cut down the third great cause of intentional injuries: war. Warscaused an estimated 502,000 deaths and countless suffering and permanent dis-ability in 1990, with similar losses seen in each subsequent year (Murray andLopez, 1996). AVENUES FOR REACHING ADULTS WITH PREVENTIVE PROGRAMS T raditionally, public health programs have focused on children and their moth- ers. The statistics in this handbook demonstrate that these programs have beensuccessful to the point that in most nations the major disablers and killers arenow found in the adult population. The causes and risk factors for these healthproblems are known, programs of prevention have demonstrated success, andthe same general approaches so successful with children are waiting to be put inmotion for people of all ages. But children might be seen as a captive population. The vast majority can be reached through parents, child-clinics, health professionals, child day care cen-ters, and schools. Places in which to reach and treat adults in the prime of lifeare not that well defined. Many working people think that making a special trip to a clinic or physician for a health reason, when they feel just fine, is just too much trouble, so it mightbe best to \"catch\" people where they go on a regular basis. In that light, theworkplace is a prime site for screening and prevention activities. This requiresthe support of an employer, who might be persuaded by arguments that betterhealth means better productivity and less absenteeism. For day laborers, theplace may be where they congregate prior to being hired. And many women andmen go to a market each week to barter, sell, or buy. A community market is aconvenient place to reach people of all ages with health services. In the Americas, the Middle East, the Far East, and much of Europe, religious observance is common. Most faiths set aside a day of worship and this day, orother times when people gather at places of worship, may be well suited to reachpeople for whom the workplace is not convenient. In urban areas, other regulargathering places such as sports stadiums, theaters, and other public buildings oropen areas, may be considered for promotion and health prevention activities. 119 THE PRIME OF LIFE: AGES 25-64 YEARS51331_p127_147_r1 4/7/03 2:22 PM Page connectedness can be employed to \"fish for\" those adults not caught by the above networks. Convincing leaders of extended families and kinship groups of the importance of a newhealth action and of how it can strengthenthe whole family in the future, is a first step.Getting those leaders to accept responsibil-ity for teaching and bringing in their entiregroup to participate in the health programsis the second. Involving friendships and occupational and interest groups helps health program participation greatly, especially in more urban settings where kinship ties areweakened. Worker groups, women's organizations, sports clubs (both for activeparticipants and their older family and friends), church groups, civic clubs, po-litical organizations, neighborhood improvement groups, farmers' cooperatives\u2014all these are already existing social networks that can be \"borrowed\" to serve ahealth purpose. (Also review the twelve channels of communication pre- sented in the section \"Presenting Programs Successfully\" in Chapter 12.These can help put health improvement on the agenda of even morepeople.) SCREENING BY INTERVIEW TOBACCO USE Cigarette smoking damages nearly every body system. The problem with smok- ing onlya few cigarettes is the extremely powerful chemical urge to smoke more and more; abstinence is actually easier to maintain. There is less evidence forhealth damage from minimal occasional cigar or pipe usage. Chewing tobacco or betel nut and the like, leaves carcinogens in contact with the mouth's mucosa for many hours, damaging the mouth and nearby tis-sues. Cessation of tobacco use is the biggest single contribution one can maketo the health of the individual, the family, and the community. (Also see Chap- ter 13.) EATING HABITS Ascertain what the person and his or her family usually eat at home and away, such as in school and at work. Optimally, people should be eating several serv-ings of vegetables, salad foods, and fruits each day (for cancer prevention), aswell as whole grains and protein sources having minimal saturated fat. Eating 120 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHInvolving friendships and occupational and interest groups helps health program participation greatly, especially in more urban settings where kinship ties are weakened .51331_p127_147_r1 4/7/03 2:22 PM Page 120habits should minimize consumption of fatty meats, butter, salt, and lard for cardiovascular health. Dairy products are healthful, especially if their fat contentis reduced below \"natural\" levels. People should keep calorie intake balanced byphysical exertion so that a healthy weight is maintained. REGULAR EXERCISE What is the person's usual amount of physical exertion\u2014on the job; at home;in other activities? From ages 10 to 75 more strenuous exercise is better, exercisethat involves large muscle groups, such as bicycling, swimming, working on thefarm or in a garden, or engaging in active sports. In the older years, exerciseshould continue: daily 30-to-40 minute walks yield benefits for the whole body,including the brain (Paluska and Schwenk, 2000). ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION Evaluate both the usual amount consumed in a week and the maximum amounttaken at any one occasion. The CAGE questionnaire will screen for drinkingproblems in cooperative persons (Schofield, 1988). Drinking five or more alco-holic drinks on any one occasion, or drinking to the point of losing control orcoordination, are signs of binge drinking and loss of control. Regular con-sumption of more than two alcoholic drinks per day (equivalent to 2 oz ofethanol) can raise resting blood pressure over time. Continuing this modestlevel of daily drinking for 10 years or more raises the risk of alcoholic liver dam-age. (Also see the \"Screening Checklist\" in Chapter 4.) Continued alcohol use for many years also raises the risk of peptic ulcers; con-gestive heart failure; cancers of the head, neck, liver, and pancreas; and damageto the nervous system resulting in psychiatric and neurologic disorders. Alcoholalso releases impulsive aggressive behaviors; causes family breakups; and raisesrisk of injuries, legal problems, assault, and suicide. Ask especially about driving vehicles after drinking. In most industrialized na- tions, if a person's blood alcohol concentration (by weight) is 0.10% or higher,he or she is considered legally intoxicated. Tests in driving simulators show in-dividual differences in the blood alcohol concentration at which people startlosing coordination and skill, ranging from 0.05% to higher than 0.20%. Inmany places, legal codes are based on blood chemistry, not behavioral condi-tion. Death and disability due to trauma are not fully curable, but are largelypreventable. Alcohol abuse exacts a heavy price from the family and communityin physical and mental health, social welfare, and economics. (Also see the section on \"Alcohol Use\" in Chapter 13.) 121 THE PRIME OF LIFE: AGES 25-64 YEARS51331_p127_147_r1 4/7/03 2:22 PM Page 121USE OF OTHER MOOD ALTERING SUBSTANCES Prevalence of drug abuse declines after age 35, but more people begin misusing over-the-counter and prescription drugs after that age, especially for pain relief.It is worth asking: \"What kinds of drugs, medications, or other remedies do youtake to help you feel better?\" Then evaluate the substance, and its frequency andquantity of use. Be aware that respondents often underestimate or deny usage. (Also see pertinent item in the \"Screening Checklist\" in Chapter 4.) SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING The dark side of this coin is the wide prevalence of neuropsychiatric disorders,and the even wider spread of life crises, losses, sorrows, and nervousness that arethe common colds and mild fevers of the psyche. Some useful exploratory questions might include: \"How are things at home?\" \"How do you like your job?\" \"When was the last time you felt so sad that youcried?\" \"Can you tell me more about that?\" \"Does nervousness run in your fam-ily?\" \"How often do you feel nervous?\" For women especially, probe further onthe issue of depression with questions such as: \"Are there times when you can-not get going?\" \"Times when you just don't care anymore; when everything isgoing badly?\" For men, probe alcohol, depression, and aggressiveness: \"Do youspend time in places or with groups where people get drunk, or start arguing orfighting, or perhaps carry weapons?\" Ask the interviewees where they expect to be and what they would want to be doing five years from now. If respondents don't know, ask them to guess. Thisprobe also can be done with groups of adults responding in writing on a printed form. Answers may reveal any of the following:depression, hopelessness, unrealistic goals, fatal-ism, a sense of dead end in the person's life, an in-ability to go beyond living only for the moment,a desire to flee the present situation, or destruc- tive wishes. On the other hand, answers may show persons to be satisfied withtheir present lot and having positive expectations and plans for the future. These suggestions are not intended to replace the need for mental health work- ers in screening in the health services. In fact, when such interviewing, or ques-tionnaire screening, is done routinely, the need for trained counselors and pre-ventive programs may become much more apparent. SEXUAL PRACTICES This issue, as is alcohol consumption, is where the people in greatest danger are more likely to understate their behaviors. Sometimes, more truthful answers 122 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHSexually transmitted infections inflict a heavier toll of disability on women.51331_p127_147_r1 4/7/03 2:22 PM Page 122may be obtained by prefacing the questions with a permissive statement such as: \"These days people are engaging in many kinds of sexual activities. Can you tellme about the people you know or associate with? What kinds of sex do theyhave?\" (Record replies.) Follow up with questions such as: \"Which ones of thesehave you engaged in?\" 2(Also review the suggestions made for this topic in the \"Screening Checklist\" in Chapter 4.) Be aware that sexually transmitted infections inflict a heavier toll of disability on women. Pelvic inflammatory disease, sterility, and other tissue damage arecommon sequellae. Men often bring sexually transmitted infections home\u2014toleave them with their wives or partners. This line of questioning is intended to identify those risks that put future health in jeopardy, such as having multiple partners; having sex without protective bar-riers (such as latex condoms) to prevent infection by exchanging body fluids ortissue friction; having sex with persons whose sexual history is not well known;having anal contact; and having oral or genital contact with sores, pimples, orwarts that may contain herpes and viral or bacterial agents. The goal is to makeall sexual behaviors safe. Just one unguarded occasion could deliver a lethal sex-ually transmitted infection. (For an in-depth discussion, see the section on \"Unsafe Sex\" in Chapter 4.) Women and couples should be questioned regarding family planning and contra- ceptive use and counseled about the several options available. This is particularlyimportant for women who already experience health problems relating to the re-productive system or whose families already exceed their emotional and physicalresources. (Further information about family planning can be found in the item on pregnancy prevention in the \"Screening Checklist\" in Chapter 13.) RISKS OF MOTOR VEHICLE TRAUMA OR INJURY Does the person ever ride with drivers who have been drinking alcohol? Does the person himself ever drive after alcohol use? Has the person or any friends recently been charged with traffic violations? (A predictor of a future injurious crash) 123 THE PRIME OF LIFE: AGES 25-64 YEARS2There is controversy about how best to ask questions about alcohol, illicit drugs, sexual activ- ity, and other possibly illegal or embarrassing behaviors. For ideas on this issue, see Sudman andBradburn (1982 and later editions). Chapter 3 in this source deals with asking potentially threat-ening questions about behavior.51331_p127_147_r1 4/7/03 2:22 PM Page 123Has the person or any friends had vehicle accidents? (Depending on circum- stances, it might predict future mishaps.) Does the person ride in autos or trucks without using seat belts? Seat belts donot prevent collisions, but do protect the human body from fatal concussionimpact and ejection out of the vehicle. Does the person ride motorcycles or motor scooters without a protective hel-met? Bicycles and motorbikes contribute to many injuries. These may resultfrom being struck by a car or truck, hitting a stationary object (post, curb,wall), striking a hole in the road, or sliding and falling on sandy or wet sur-faces. Helmets prevent facial and brain injuries\u2014the latter, of course, beingincurable. RISKS OF OCCUPATIONAL INJURY Does the person work with tools or machines similar to that on which otherworkers are injured from time to time? Can this problem be reduced by pro-tective changes in the machinery? Should workers be given protective gear orgarments? Should workers be trained differently? (The recent experience ofthe work group is the best predictor of near-future individual risk.) Is the worker exposed to dust, chemicals, or biological agents that can accu-mulate either acutely or chronically in the body and impair health? Does the worker lift or carry heavy loads, or perform work that involves twist-ing or holding poor posture for long periods? These are all common causes ofmusculoskeletal injury and disability, which may be prevented by workertraining or minor re-engineering of work tasks. Back injuries are increasinglycommon and can be disabling. In fact, many industries sponsor brief \"backschools\" to train workers how to prevent such injuries. SOCIAL SUPPORT NETWORK Persons should be asked how many adults and children live in their household.How many people are able to offer help if problems occur in the family (prob-lems such as no one to care for children if the mother gets sick, the roof leaks,the family temporarily runs out of enough money to cover its needs, needinghelp to send a message or do an errand)? Ask also if there are one or more persons with whom the interviewee can discuss worries or share feelings. From how many individuals does the person feel com-fortable enough to seek information or advice? If the answer in any category is 124 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p127_147_r1 4/7/03 2:22 PM Page 124\"none or one,\" discuss with the person how to increase the social support net- work. To assess the quality of the social context, the interviewer might ask:\"How are things at home?\" or, \"Overall, are the people you are with every day asource of encouragement and help or a source of trouble and worry?\" (Often thehonest answer is both, in which case the relative balance should be assessed.) HEALTH PROBLEMS IN OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS Make appropriate referrals to health clinics or social agencies. Studies have shownthat untreated health problems in any one family member are associated withincreased vulnerability for the rest of the family to other kinds of illnesses andlife difficulties. HOME SAFETY Do stairs or porch railings need repair? Are smoke detectors and alarms installedif appropriate; have they been recently tested? (If there are young children in the home, see the \"Screening Checklist\" in Chapters 3 and 4.) SCREENING BY OBSERVATION APPEARANCE AND BEHAVIOR During the time spent with the individual or group, the clinician should remain alert for: signs of emotional depression (also see the section on \"Recognizing and Dealing with Depression\" in Chapter 7); signs of fearfulness, anxiety, or hyperactivity; signs of schizoid thinking or bizarre appearance; signs of physical abuse or neglect (also see the section on \"Suicide and Vi- olence\" in Chapter 11); signs of respiratory difficulty (also see Chapter 10) ; and other physical signs or behaviors of health relevance. Information for the items listed above may be gathered from groups by using questionnaires, or by a group-administered interview, wherein the questions are 125 THE PRIME OF LIFE: AGES 25-64 YEARS51331_p127_147_r1 4/7/03 2:22 PM Page 125read to the group. The answers are given on individual answer sheets with num- bered questions and boxes for checking the multiple possible replies. Questionsalso may be read to the respondents, asking them to mark in box 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.,to indicate their answer. These latter options allow rapid collection of informa-tion from large groups having limited literacy. CLINICAL AND LABORATORY SCREENS AND PROPHYLAXES This is an ideal list. What is routine in any given place will depend on the major health problems of local men and women, clinic facilities, cost-effectiveness,and available resources. HEIGHT AND WEIGHT MEASUREMENT This is a preliminary indicator for either obesity or undernutrition. Either con-dition could aggravate other diseases. BLOOD PRESSURE MEASUREMENT Measure blood pressure three times during the visit. If the average falls in thehypertensive range for adults (systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure >90 for borderline hypertension; systolic blood pressure >160 or diastolic blood pressure >95 for definite hypertension), have the client come back in a week or so for another set of measurements. A single measure (or asingle occasion) is too unreliable for clinical decision-making. (Also see the section \"Hypertension and Hypertensive Heart Disease\" in Chapter 8.) MAMMOGRAM In the United States this diagnostic test is recommended every year in women ages 50-59 (United States Preventive Services Task Force, 1996, Chapter 7).This will not be possible in some communities and nations, and may not becost-effective in areas where breast cancer rates are very low. Where mammog-raphy is not available, clinical breast examinations should be done for womenaged 50-70. In many cultures this is most acceptable if performed by a femaleclinician. (Also see the section \"Breast Cancer\" in Chapter 9.) PAP SMEARS In sexually active women perform a Papanicolaou smear every one to threeyears, if economically feasible. Every adult woman should be tested until two 126 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p127_147_r1 4/7/03 2:22 PM Page 126consecutive tests are fully negative (United States Preventive Services Task Force, 1996). If there is an increase in the number of her sexual partners, Pap smearswould be resumed. SKIN LESIONS Look unobtrusively at arms for needle marks from use of injected drugs. Lookalso for the beginnings of skin cancers in persons heavily exposed to sunshine. (Also see the section on \"Skin Cancers\" in Chapter 9.) TUBERCULOSIS Do an appropriate test for tuberculosis if the person is in a social group whererates are elevated or for whom a family member, close friend, or coworker hasbeen recently diagnosed with TB. Be alert for reactivation of old TB lesions inpeople experiencing malnutrition, extended hardship, social upheaval, or chronicinfections. ORAL HEALTH Check the mouth for tooth decay, gum disease, oral hygiene, and mucosal le-sions suggestive of oral cancers or immunosuppression. (Also see section on \"Head and Neck Cancers\" in Chapter 9.) SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS Persons whose behaviors put them at higher risk for sexually transmitted infec- tions should be examined, given laboratory tests as appropriate, and counseledregarding dangers of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. (Also see the section on \"Unsafe Sex\" in Chapter 13.) ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE Where there is high prevalence of ischemic heart disease, do a non-fasting test for total serum cholesterol, starting at age 35 in men and at age 45 in women,and continuing until age 65. Repeat the test about every five years, more oftenif cholesterol is high, less often if low. Persons with total serum cholesterolhigher than 200 mg/dl should be counseled to reduce dietary intake of fats, es-pecially saturated fats. Persons with total serum cholesterol higher than 240 mg/dl should be referred for medical review in addition to dietary guidance (United 127 THE PRIME OF LIFE: AGES 25-64 YEARS51331_p127_147_r1 4/7/03 2:22 PM Page 127States Preventive Services Task Force, 1996). (Also see the section on \"Is- chemic Heart Disease\" in Chapter 8.) TETANUS-DIPHTHERIA A tetanus-diphtheria booster shot should be given early in adulthood and every 10 years thereafter. Puncture wounds or deep cuts may require an immediate in-jection of tetanus antitoxin, followed later by a tetanus booster. HEPATITIS B Hepatitis B vaccine is strongly recommendedfor high risk persons, such as those with fre-quent exposure to blood or blood products orrecipients of blood transfusions. In areas wherehepatitis B is epidemic and a major cause of cir-rhosis and cancers of the liver, health officialsare promoting mass immunizations at youngerages. DIGESTIVE CANCERS Be alert for signs or symptoms of digestive cancers. Ask about tarry stools. After age 50 do tests of fecal occult blood, both for colon and stomach cancers(United States Preventive Services Task Force, 1996). (Also see the section on \"Stomach Cancers\" in Chapter 9.) These screening checklists are not intended to advise physicians on how to care for their patients. Rather, they are intended to alert public health and preven-tive medicine professionals and planners to a broad list of health issues at eachstage of life, toward which locally appropriate programs may be directed. 128 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHThese screening checklists are not intended to advise physicians on how to care for their patients.

The Older Years: 65 to 100 HEALTH GOALS FOR THE LATER YEARS The most rapidly growing segment of the world's population is the oldest. Centenarians are the fastest growing group proportionally, followed by personsaged 80-99 years old. Throughout human history, people living to these ageshave been few, indeed. Over time, with the conquest of the major infectiousepidemics, the number of older persons edged upward. And now, given med-ical science's breakneck advances, especially in pharmacology, \"senior citizens\"are coming into their own. It has been forecast that in the 21st century, thegrowing population of persons older than age 85\u2014the \"old-old\"\u2014with theirtremendous consumption of medical services, will spark major economic,medical resource, and ethical crises for developed and developing nationsalike. The field of gerontology has been running fast to keep pace with this demo- graphic transition. In field studies gerontologists and geriatricians have shownthat many of our long-held \"common sense\" beliefs about the old and aging aresimply wrong. The older a group of people gets, the more variety they show. Infact, the elderly show much greater variation in physical, mental, and socialfunctioning than any other age group. Functional declines with age can be postponed by maintaining an active phys- ical, mental, and social life. And so, the goal of health promotion programs forolder people is not to prolong life indefinitely, but rather to put as much life aspossible into the years that remain for each person. One way to help reduce the heavy consumption of health care resources by the older population is to compress the period of terminal morbidity. The objectivehere is to keep people active and caring for themselves independently until asclose as possible to their death. This would minimize the duration, althoughnot necessarily the intensity, of the medical care they require. But it clearly re-duces suffering and limits the feelings of decline for the elders and their care-takers and family. The economics of intensive medical care for the elderly are increasingly under debate. When medical resources are inadequate for the entire population, whoshould get the priority? The elderly? Young adults? Developmentally damaged 129 THE OLDER YEARS: 65 TO 10051331_p148_160_r1 4/7/03 3:16 PM Page 129babies? Pregnant women? Or, should the best care be given only to those who have enough money to pay for it, regardless of age or prognosis? Medical economists report that in post-industrialized nations, about 18% of an average person's lifetime medical expenses are spent in the last year of life. Howmuch of these resources, spent when life expectancy is only perhaps one year,should be instead spent upstream in the river of life, to provide preventive ser-vices to younger productive people earlier in their voyage? The economic arguments about the degree of emphasis on geriatric care involve a debate as to whose benefit is most important, the individual or the commu-nity as a whole. Does the money spent keeping a 70-year-old alive deliver asmuch benefit as the same amount spent to provide intensive care in a coronaryunit for a 50-year-old with myocardial infarction? Or, say, to provide hospicecare for a 30-year-old with AIDS? Or, orthopedic surgery and rehabilitation for an 18-year-old with multiple fractures from an automobile crash? Quickly, moral as well aseconomic judgments enter the discussion. On the benefit side of the equation, extending the life span into later decades has been ac-companied by well-maintained mental capac-ity, physical strength, and community produc- tivity in most older people. In nations where retirement benefits are available atage 65, many people stop working when they reach that age. Yet, a surprisingnumber draw their pensions but go out and get jobs, often pursuing occupa-tions that demand less physical strength or carry less stress. In more agrarian set-tings, men and women continue to work at farming as long as their strengthholds out. The bottom line of this discussion is that there are many opportunities\u2014often overlooked by society as well as by individual\u2014for older folks to contribute eco-nomically, socially, or interpersonally to their families and their communities.For example, in communities where young mothers commonly enter the work-force, adequate parenting may be in short supply. Enter the grandparents: theexperience and patience of the \"grandparent generation\" suits them well for pro-viding supplementary parenting. Given the many problems of today's childrenand youth, grandparenting\u2014even as unpaid work\u2014may well be one of thegreatest economic and social gifts anyone can give his or her community. AndI'm sure we all can come up with additional examples. The important psycho-logical, social, and cultural benefits provided by older community residents arejust beginning to be discovered. What can health workers do to help older persons realize their full potential\u2014 and to reduce their need for high-tech medical care? 130 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHThe goal of health promotion programs for older people is not to prolong life indefinitely, but rather to put as much life as possible into the years that remain for each person.51331_p148_160_r1 4/7/03 3:16 PM Page 130MAJOR HEALTH PROBLEMS AT THESE AGES MORTALITY Life expectancy is the age to which the middle person (in terms of age) in a population cohort survives. Since most economically developed countries havelife expectancies at birth of more than 65 years, more than half of all deaths willoccur in the 65-years-and-older age stratum. Thus, the causes of death in thisage stratum will dominate the total for the nation as a whole. This means thatit is essential to study the causes of death and disability separately for each stageof life\u2014as earlier chapters in this Handbook have done\u2014to guide focused pre-ventive efforts earlier in the life cycle. It is not surprising, then, that crude death rates for nations, based heavily on deaths of old people, show that cardiovascular disorders, cerebrovascular dis-eases, malignancies, obstructive lung diseases, and pneumonias are the leadingcauses of death in most regions of the world. This holds true for nations bothearly and late in their economic evolution. The acceleration of mortality speeds up as the decades of life pass. From ages 25 to 34 years, the rates of mortality from all causes double for each successivedecade, for both men and women in most nations. In every decade, men's deathrates (per 100,000) are clearly higher than those for women. For some causes, the multiplier is even greater per decade. For total cardiovas- cular diseases in most countries, mortality is two to three times as high at age65 years as it is at age 55, and again multiplies four to five times from age 75and older. Cerebrovascular accidents (strokes) show a similar acceleration ofrates after age 55. Total cancers double between ages 55 to 65, and again afterage 65. All this means that death rates are speeded up 10 to 15 times over thelast three or four decades of the life cycle. This information on the acceleration of death rates at older ages reveals three important facts: the rapid acceleration of vulnerability among older people. the potential societal gains from effective earlier prevention programs. Theseprograms could delay this surge of disease and death until later in the life cycle. the huge increase in costs for medical care and nursing-home care in the largenumber of older people who remain disabled and dependent, often for yearsbefore dying from their disease conditions. 131 THE OLDER YEARS: 65 TO 10051331_p148_160_r1 4/7/03 3:16 PM Page 131GENERAL SYSTEMIC DISEASES AND DISABILITIES Many older people suffer through years of disability\u2014feeling and functioning poorly\u2014before they die. Now we know that much can be done to reduce risksand severity of disabling conditions, maybe not for all but certainly for many.The major causes for suffering and frailty include the leading reasons for death,and also other kinds of health problems. Up to 1990, the world's population over age 60 years was still smaller than that of other age groups. Women outnumbered men by a ratio of 123 to 100, andgender differences in the relative weight of different causes of disability weremuch less than among middle-aged people. For all of the world's regions, 80%to 95% of disabled years are attributed to noncommunicable diseases. Overall,the impact on disability from communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutri-tional conditions falls from 46% for ages 0-4 years to 6% in persons 60 yearsold and older. Similarly, the impact of all injuries on disability falls from 18%for ages 0-4 to 2.5% in ages 60 years old and older (worldwide YLD data takenfrom Murray and Lopez, 1996, Annex Table 8). 132 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHLEADING NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASE CAUSES OF DISABILITY WORLDWIDE In Older Men respiratory disorders (mostly chronic obstructive lung disease), cardiovascular diseases (mostly ischemic heart disease and stroke), and neuropsychiatric conditions (mostly dementia). In Older Women neuropsychiatric conditions (mostly dementia, with major depression also), respiratory disorders (mostly chronic obstructive lung disease), cardiovascular diseases (stroke and ischemic heart disease), and visual loss from cataracts and glaucoma. Malignancies are a prominent cause of death in both older men and women, but contribute smaller numbers of disabled life years than the above conditions.(The factors which lead to and protect from neuropsychiatric, respiratory, andcardiovascular diseases will be examined in depth in Chapters 7, 8, and 10.) RISK FACTORS FOR MAJOR CAUSES OF DEATH AND DISABILITY Cigarette smoking is a strong contributor to the development of ischemic heart disease (heart attack), cerebrovascular disease (stroke), chronic obstruc-tive lung disease, bronchitis and/or pneumonias, and many cancers. Smok-ing ups the ante for the potential amount of sickness and suffering and de-termines the type of death. There is only one solution\u2014stop smoking. 51331_p148_160_r1 4/7/03 3:16 PM Page 132High fat diets raise the risk of colon and prostate cancers, and possibly other cancers. They also powerfully increase atherosclerosis, which expresses itselfin heart attack and stroke. High blood pressure is the strongest contributor to stroke (both hemorrhagicand thrombotic), helps cause heart attack, and when severe will also damagethe kidneys. The solution is to lower blood pressure, by using medications orimproving one's lifestyle. (Also see the section on \"Hypertension and Hy- pertensive Disease\" in Chapter 8.) Obesity burdens the heart and lungs. It raises blood pressure and is associated with increased low-density lipoproteins (bad cholesterol); it promotes adultonset diabetes mellitus. Obesity also raises the risk of colon, kidney, and en-dometrial cancers. And, by putting excessive weight on the lower limbs, it ag-gravates arthritis in the joints. The solution\u2014lose weight and maintain a lowhealthy weight; exercise and reduced caloric intake will help. PROTECTIVE FACTORS FOR MAJOR CAUSES OF DEATH AND DISABILITY Yes, even the oldest age groups can enhance protective factors. Recent research repeatedly has shown that regular physical exercise continues to provide muchgreater benefits at a much later age than common sense would have predicted.For example, a research study randomized 70 to 79 year old persons into a walk-ing group and a control group. After 26 weeks, the walking group had increasedtheir maximum oxygen uptake by 22%. This is a striking rejuvenation in viewof the fact that from about age 30 onwardmaximum oxygen uptake for most peopledeclines by an average of 1% per year. Infact, walking may be one of the best formsof exercise for older people. Older persons can derive important im- provements from exercise programs, espe-cially endurance training and resistancetraining. Just keeping physically active alonehelps control diabetes and reduces the riskof stroke. In a large cohort of older women,those who spent fewer than four hours a dayon their feet had double the rate of hip fractures, compared to those who wereup and about four or more hours. These benefits not only postpone death, butthey also reduce risk of falls, prevent disability, and increase stamina. And the 133 THE OLDER YEARS: 65 TO 100The longer in a lifespan that risk factors for these diseases can bekept low and protective factors can bekept high, the fewer adults that willdie prematurely; the better healthadults will carry with them into thisperiod, thus postponing terminaldecline; and the less medical servicesthey will consume.51331_p148_160_r1 4/7/03 3:16 PM Page 133good news is that moderate exercise is almost as beneficial as hard exercise, and carries much less risk of injury (Carlson et al., 1999). There are many different published exercise prescriptions, but most share the following points: exercise regularly, preferably four or more times per week, do it with enough zest to make you breathe faster and your heart beat faster, continue to exercise for 20 to 30 minutes, slow down if you are breathing too fast to carry on a conversation, if you gaspfor breath, or if you feel any pressure, heaviness, or pain in your chest, shoul-der, neck, or left arm. Another important protective factor is to consume a healthy diet. Eating a vari- ety of foods will give a person the full range of nutrients. Vegetables, fruits, cleansalad foods, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products should be eaten every day,if possible. Lean meats should be eaten in moderation and fats that are solid at room temperature should be avoided. Weight should be kept at a healthynormal level. During food shortages, an elderly person should try to consumeenough calories to maintain a normal body weight. If possible, vegetable sourcesof protein should be included in the diet, as well as the foods listed above. MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS Musculoskeletal conditions\u2014arthritis and osteoporosis\u2014are associated withhip and spinal fractures. Taken together, they are major causes of disability andlimitations of mobility, especially in elderly women living in highly developednations. Arthritis, an inflammation in joints and adjacent tissues, will, overtime, destroy cartilage and change the shape of the bone. It can affect hands andarms, feet and the legs, and the back or neck. Both ostheoarthritis and rheuma-toid arthritis become more prevalent and more severe with advancing age. Theseconditions are two to three times more common in women than men. Thearthritides are reported to be the major cause of limitations of mobility in theelderly in some industrialized nations. Arthritis T rue rheumatoid arthritis appears to result from a wayward immunologic process in which antibodies, whose job is to fight off outside infection, falselyidentify some of a person's own cells as outside invaders. The fight that followscauses inflammation and, after months or years, ends up as a chronic disease. 134 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p148_160_r1 4/7/03 3:16 PM Page 134The full etiology of rheumatoid arthritis is not known, nor have primary pre- ventive measures been established. The disease has a genetic component, andoral contraceptives seem to reduce symptoms in some women. One step to re-duce the progression of rheumatoid arthritis (secondary prevention) is for thepatient to take nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce inflammation,pain, and fever, because they are thought to increase damage to tissues in thejoints. Care must be taken to avoid overdosing these medications because theycan damage other organs. Osteoarthritis is the more prevalent type, and its frequency increases rapidly with age. Redness of adjacent skin, joint swelling, morning stiffness, and painat night are its core symptoms. T rauma to joints or repetitive stress and strainon joints are thought to set off many cases. Obesity makes matters worse, byoverloading joints. Secondary prevention involves reversing these two risk fac-tors. Proper exercise can be a protective factor that can reduce the amount ofdisability and pain. Exercise should be gentle and daily to improve flexibility of joints without overloading them. An \"Arthritis Self-Management Course\" has been developed which has been shown to significantly reduce pain, doctorvisits, and hospitalizations (Lorig et al., 1999). The economic and personal costs of arthritis and other musculoskeletal impair- ments are rapidly rising worldwide. Occupational health specialists can help toprevent or delay many of these cases (especially disabling back injuries) by er-gonomically readjusting work activities, thus reducing the frequency and inten-sity of work movements that repetitively strain joints, especially in the spine. Osteoporosis This condition mostly affects people over age 65, and it is more prevalent inwomen than men\u2014almost all women over age 75 have X-ray evidence of os-teoporosis in their lower spine. Pathologically, it consists of a loss of calciumfrom bones, which weakens them to the point of easy fracture. Osteoporosisspells the difference between a fall that is uneventful and a fall that ends in frac-ture and permanent disability. Most such fractures occur in the arms, legs, hips,and spinal column. Risk Factors for Osteoporosis. (1) A sedentary lifestyle, (2) a diet low in calcium, (3) smoking tobacco, and (4) decreased estrogen in postmenopausal women. Protective Factors for Osteoporosis. All of these are especially effective when practiced continually from an early age. (1) Exercise regularly\u2014weight bearingexercise, such as walking or running, is particularly beneficial. Putting thebody's weight on the bones presses calcium into the bone matrix, and strength-ening the leg muscles helps prevent falls; even standing is more beneficial than 135 THE OLDER YEARS: 65 TO 10051331_p148_160_r1 4/7/03 3:16 PM Page 135sitting. Swimming greatly benefits the heart and lungs, but does little for osteo- porosis). (2) Have an adequate dietary calcium intake. (3) Consider estrogen re-placement, if a physician advises it. Environmental Protections. Since falls and other injuries become more com- mon again in later years, elders\u2014and others\u2014should be protected by providingthe following (Haber, 1994): provide plenty of light where there are steps or slopes, install handrails on stairs if there are none, apply adhesive strips or a rough surface in bathtubs and showers, install strong bars to hold onto in the bathroom, use floor coatings that do not get slippery when wet, lay down rugs that do not slide, exercise regularly to improve leg strength and balance. Where heating or cooking involves fire, take fire safety precautions\u2014have ex- tinguishing materials such as water, sand, and/or fire extinguishers always athand. Make it easy to escape quickly from any room to the outside. Rememberthat those at highest risk of death from smoke and fire are infants, the disabled,and the very old. PRESERVING PHYSICAL AND MENTAL FUNCTIONING For centuries, people believed that the calendar beat the drum in the later years,and that our lives inevitably unraveled into functional decline. Recent social-behavioral studies that follow large groups of older persons over time have clearly changed that belief, however. Now we knowthat it is we, ourselves, not the calendar, whocontrol the drumbeat and change the rate of our biopsychosocial aging. Any group ofpeople celebrating their 80th birthdays willreveal a range of capacities and functions matching averages for people all the way from ages 65 to 95 years old. Again, theolder the group, the greater their range of differences (Rowe and Kahn, 1998). All the studies, both of rapid deterioration of health and of successful active aging, can be summarized in a single \"prescription\": \"Use it, or lose it.\" 136 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHAll the studies, both of rapid deteriora- tion of health and of successful active aging, can be summarized in a single \"prescription\": \"Use it, or lose it.\"51331_p148_160_r1 4/7/03 3:16 PM Page 136Physical capacity is maintained by regular physical exercise. Hand dexterity and coordination is helped by continually using those skills. Capacity for long walksis retained\u2014as are tennis-playing skills\u2014by doing it. Verbal fluency is helpedby reading, doing word puzzles, and discussing new topics. Numeric skills aremaintained by doing arithmetic. Very often, but by no means always, older years bring a slowing of physical and mental performance. With practice, however, people can compensate for theslowing by working longer and with more concentration. Short-term memoryalso declines (e.g., for names, what one needs from the store, what one did lastweek), but less rapidly in busy brains than in those left passive. Rowe and Kahn (1998) cover a list of conditions that strengthen and extend mental capacities in the later years, which are listed below. PROTECTIVE FACTORS FOR MENTAL ABILITIES Having had longer education as a youth. The effects of longer education per-sist for more than 50 years in an increased level of mental processing skills,logical thinking, and fund of knowledge as one enters older age; and in aslower decline in mental performance skills during later years. Continuing to engage in \"cognitive exercise\" by tackling complex tasks at thehigh end of one's capabilities. Maintaining a sense of self-efficacy: the belief, faith, and action that \"I can dowhat is necessary or expected\"\u2014never giving up without a good try. Engaging in regular physical activity that makes one breathe harder and one'sheart beat faster. Maintaining good lung function through physical exercise. Healthy breath-ing capacity helps fill blood hemoglobin with oxygen, thus keeping brain cellsfunctioning well. Maintaining regular interaction with others. The daily exchange of informa-tion and feelings keeps one's sense of reality accurately tuned, exercises socialand language skills, modulates the excitatory and inhibitory functions, andprobably does much more. TREATING PAIN AND SUFFERING Health promotion and disease prevention aim to increase health and quality of life, as well as to avoid unnecessary suffering, be it mental or physical. Thera-peutic medicine aims to relieve pain and restore function\u2014that is, to heal. But 137 THE OLDER YEARS: 65 TO 10051331_p148_160_r1 4/7/03 3:16 PM Page 137inevitably, science-based efforts of human professionals will no longer suffice; pain and suffering take over. But even at that point, many medications are avail-able to effectively relieve almost all kinds of suffering in critical, terminal injuryor disease. Modern hospice care has found new levels and timing of dosage ofmedications that relieve pain, nausea, and other suffering more effectively thanmost hospital care has achieved in the past. Physicians must learn the newerpain relieving methods and be more willing to use them. Even dying peopleshould not be required to suffer when relief is available. Relieving suffering isthe last great gift health professionals can give to those for whom they care. The major tasks of health professionals who care for persons in the final years of life are to relieve physical and emotional pain, prevent or ameliorate loss offunction, and reconnect persons to some kind of \"family,\" so that this part oflife's journey need not be traveled alone. To some professionals reconnecting older persons to other people may seem frivolous, or a luxury for rich nations. Actually, it is both humane and cost- 138 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHACTION CHECKLIST FOR GENERAL PREVENTIVE MEASURES FOR AGES 65 YEARS OLD AND OLDER Health professionals should review their patients' medications, whether prescriptions or over-the-counter, for drug interactions. Consider replacing any medications that raise therisk for falls. As people age, their medicine cabinets get more crowded. Are all thesemedications still essential? If the physician can eliminate medicines no longer needed, riskof adverse interactions will be reduced and adherence to the remainder will be improved. Ask about signs of transient ischemic attacks, a common prodrome to strokes. (Also see the section on strokes in Chapter 8.) Listen for abnormal sounds in the arteries of the neck (carotid bruits), a risk factor for stroke. Observe face and movement; ask questions or use a brief screening questionnaire to de- tect depressive reactions. Depression exacerbates chronic physical diseases as well asbeing a psychobiologic condition that undermines quality of life. For women, conduct Pap smears and clinical breast exams, as well as mammograms, if indicated. The highest incidence of breast cancer occurs after age 65 years, as well asnearly half of uterine cancer deaths. Check for fecal occult blood (sign of possible digestive cancer or ulcerative disease). Blackened or tar-like bowel movements are an advanced sign of pathology. Earlier de-tection by an inexpensive laboratory test is much preferred. Encourage regular exercise. These three words, if put into action, are the secret of fu- ture good health. Administer influenza and pneumococcal vaccine, if indicated. Elders are much more vul- nerable to serious complications if unprotected. Check eyes for glaucoma. This treatable condition, if ignored, can lead to blindness. Check skin for incipient malignancies. (Also see section on \"Skin Cancers\" in Chapter 9.) Be alert for signs of neglect or abuse, which increase among dependent elderly. Check for social isolation, which by itself becomes a risk factor for disability and death. Involve lonely persons in social elationships, including \"back-ups\" if the primary sup-ports are lost. Encourage people to visit each other, have meals together, share theirstories and feelings.51331_p148_160_r1 4/7/03 3:16 PM Page 138effective no matter what the economic circumstances. People living alone at every age have higher death rates than those who live and interact with others.Research into the health effects of social support is unanimous in showing thatpositive interpersonal interactions lower older persons' risk of death and post-pone their descent into disability, thus generating more healthy life-years. Manyolder people, especially women, have lost their spouses through death, and theiradult children may be geographically scattered or otherwise unable to help them.Communities designed for older people and assisted-living facilities serve torecreate interacting, mutually supportive groups. Many cultures hold on to the tradition in which adult children's families care for elderly family members. This may well be the most health-promoting system ofall for the elderly. There may be some strains on the younger family, but multipleadult children may split the responsibility and the time, and thus lighten the load. Belonging to groups also enhances health. Religious congregations, shared in- terest groups, informal gatherings of neighbors\u2014all have been shown to in-crease healthy years lived. People in such groups tend to look after one another.Feeling needed by others in the group can give an older person, with all his/herformer goals now in the past, new reasons to be active, to take better care of one-self, and still to contribute to the well-being of others. In fact, even taking careof infants in the family can have a salutary effect for all three generations. COMMUNITY ACTION FOR OLDER CITIZENS Most of the preventive measures and health screenings recommended above are worded from a clinical perspective. Fortunately, many of the elderly's needs canbe partially served by community level activities. Group health education pro-grams, simple screening tests, and referrals can be organized by communityagencies, hospital outreach programs, churches, senior citizen groups, retire-ment homes, and neighborhoods. The group approach to lifestyle changes has a powerful advantage\u2014a friendly group of people who share similar needs can more effectively teach and moti-vate each other, better sharpen their skills by imitation and repetition, and re-ward each other for keeping up a healthier lifestyle. A friendly group achievesthis much more subtly, comprehensively, and powerfully than any doctor, nurse,teacher, or expert can, because people often perceive those outsiders from theirgroup as different from them. These sorts of self-help groups often are started by a health professional and gradually are turned over to group leaders. WHO now recognizes the self-helpmovement in all its forms as an important vehicle for advancing \"health for all.\"Groups may focus on regular exercise; for example a weight loss club could meet 139 THE OLDER YEARS: 65 TO 10051331_p148_160_r1 4/7/03 3:16 PM Page 139every day to walk a kilometer together. Older persons who have suffered be- reavement could meet with others passing through the same \"rough seas\" to dis-cuss practical and emotional issues involved in adjusting to the death of a lovedone. The group would help mourning elders to shift focus from the past, and toplan how to \"live forward\" and manage a new life on their own. Sharing theseexperiences can help alleviate depression; it does not make it worse. By walkingand talking together or pursuing physically active pastimes, group membershelp counter depression physiologically. Social losses and depressive episodes occur with increasing frequency in the older years. The natural antidote is participating in groups that share commoninterests or hobbies, do active things together, share meals or refreshments, pro-vide a \"change of scenery\" for people who live alone, and supply a network ofsocial support. The giving and receiving of support is reciprocal; givers and re-ceivers change roles as circumstances fluctuate. Very often the giver is helpedeven more than the receiver. (Further documentation and \"how to\" guidance forcreating supportive groups is presented in Haber, 1994.) According to a United States Institute of Medicine report (Rowe and Kahn, 1998), the keys to successful aging are: keeping the body active keeping the brain active maintaining and extending social relationships The community also can promote health in the elder years by: providing, or encouraging others to provide, places where older people can meet and share activities, periodically providing simple health promotion and screening where seniorscongregate, encouraging managers of business and public buildings to make them acces-sible to disabled or frail persons, adopting and enforcing health, safety, and quality-of-care standards for grouphomes, and enlisting the cooperation of organizations, schools, media, churches, and othertransmitters of values to make the community's way of life more \"elderly-friendly.\" 140 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p148_160_r1 4/7/03 3:16 PM Page 140PART III. BETTER UNDERSTANDING THE LEADING FORMS OF DEATH AND DISABILITY51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 1417. Brain and Behavioral Disorders Why should the discussion of these disorders precede that of such major killers as cardiovascular disorders and malignant neoplasms? There are several power-ful reasons. First, because changing thinking, motivations, and behaviors\u2014all of thembrain functions\u2014is a gateway to preventing most diseases and disabilities inall organ systems. Genetic makeup and various aspects of the environmentalso play roles, as later described. Second, because these difficult, though low technology, health behaviorchanges must be sustained over decades and through generations. Societiesurgently need to continue updating health beliefs and behaviors to keep instep with a rapidly changing world. Locally and globally, we must continueto adapt or become extinct. Third, because a \"healthy body\" living in the shadows of depression, sur-rounded by invisible fears, struggling to overcome deep neuroses, captured byaddictions to alcohol or drugs, or imprisoned by a brain gone psychotic ordemented is condemned to live a diminished, disabled life full of deep per-sonal pain, a life that soaks up more social capital than the afflicted personcan ever produce. And, fourth, because all the ideals for human life, all prescriptions for a \"lifewell-lived\" given by spiritual leaders and philosophers since ancient times,call for the foundation of a healthy mind, and an untroubled spirit housed ina healthy body. DISABILITIES OF BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study (Murray and Lopez, 1994, 1996)has developed an index\u2014Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)\u2014that com-bines years of life lost due to death (as integers) and years of life disabled (as frac-tions, with larger fractions given to greater degrees of damaged function). Thus,long-lasting disabilities such as blindness, psychiatric disorders, and crippling,can be included in reckoning the burden that nonfatal and fatal conditionsplace upon individuals, communities, and the world. The GBD Study reports that neuropsychiatric disorders are responsible for the greatest proportion (22%) of all lost DALYs in the industrially developed world. 143 BRAIN AND BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 143These disorders rank fourth in the developing world (9%). The following psy- chiatric categories, followed by their ranking in parentheses, are among the 30leading specific diagnoses (considering all causes) for lost DALYs worldwide:unipolar major depression (ranked 4); self-inflicted injuries, including suicide(17); violence or intentional harm to others (19); alcohol abuse (20); bipolardisorder, manic, depressed (22); and schizophrenia and similar psychoses (26). Mental deficiency should be added to the list. Although the epidemiologic study of mental deficiency is far from complete, according to many studies the re-ported prevalence of severe mental retardation\u2014an IQ or equivalent below 50\u2014 ranges between 3 and 5 per 1,000 populationin industrialized countries, and is consider-ably higher (5-17 per 1,000) in developingcountries. Case finding of mild mental retar-dation (defined as an IQ or local equivalentmeasure between 50 to 70) is unreliable, un-less population-wide testing is performed.Under the conservative assumption that milddeviations from normal occur far more often than extreme deviations, the prevalence of mild retardation is expected to behigher than that of severe retardation. Roeleveld and colleagues (1997) estimatedthat about 3% (30 per 1,000) of school age children are mentally retarded, andthat a \"considerable proportion\" of these cases is preventable. 1 In parallel work using a different indicator\u2014Years of Life with Disability (YLD)\u2014GBD researchers also place neuropsychiatric disorders as the major health prob-lem in developed nations, accounting for 27% of all YLD (although only for1.4% of deaths), for cardiovascular disorders (17%) and ma-lignant neoplasms (11%) in both sexes and all ages combined. Disability fromneuropsychiatric disorders reaches its peak in the age-span 15-44 years and de-clines in the older ages. In developing nations neuropsychiatric disorders cause a surprisingly high per- centage of a much larger total of YLD. Infections and parasitic diseases, for ex-ample, cause 18% of disability, and neuropsychiatric disorders rank second with15%. Thus, neuropsychiatric disorders are crushing causes of impaired livingworldwide, far outdistancing not only cardiovascular disorders and cancers, butalso unintentional injuries and musculoskeletal disorders. Even more worri-some, GBD projections for 2020 estimate that unipolar major depression, as aspecific diagnosis, will be the greatest cause of lost DALYs in the developingworld, and the third greatest in developed regions. Other causes of disability aredecreasing, but these clearly are not (Murray and Lopez, 1994, 1997). 144 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH1A review of field studies, contributing causes, and preventive goals for developing regions has been prepared by Hosking G and Murphy G (eds.), Prevention of Mental Handicap: A World View. Royal Society of Medicine Services, International Congress and Symposium Series No. 112, 1987.All prescriptions for a \"life well-lived\" given by spiritual leaders and philosophers since ancient times call for the foundation of a healthy mind, and an untroubled spirit housed in a healthy body.51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 144WHO IS VULNERABLE? People of all ages and all cultures can fall prey to disorders of brain and behav- ior. Nor are these solely the problems of humans. Even higher animals show re-sponses curiously similar to depression (after defeat by another animal), anxiety(when in an unfamiliar place), and even some delinquency and anti-social be-havior. In behavioral laboratories, experimental neuroses have been conditionedinto many species, and then relieved, which shows that neuropsychiatric disor-ders are not the fault of the sufferer, nor should parents and family be blamed. Neuropsychiatric difficulties are liabilities that come most easily to the human brain\u2014the most complicated, most subdivided, and most creative system onearth. The human brain's billions of parts work nobly, most of the time, for about5.5 to 5.8 billion of the estimated 6.2 billion people in the world. Among adultsin the 1990s, however, 6% to 10% had serious, severe, or persistent psychiatricdisorders. 2And estimates are similar for persons aged 9-17 years, with 5% to 9% of this age group affected. According to several references, rates of severe mentaldisorders are similar in developing and developed countries. When moderate,only partially disabling, psychiatric disorders are included in the prevalence fig-ures, rates about double. 3The figures from the US Federal Register show preva- lence rates of severe and moderate disorders combined to be 20% to 24%. All these estimates are, of course, greatly influenced by which diagnostic defini- tions or settings of severity threshold are used, by the design of the samplingmethods, and by socioeconomic, national, or cultural considerations. But re-gardless of which estimates are accepted, the impact of neuropsychiatric disordersis far greater than generally realized, with somewhere between 370 million and660 million persons seriously disabled worldwide. The vast majority of them arenever diagnosed professionally and never treated. Can this performance record beimproved? The scenario of healthy development detailed below suggests it can. A HEALTHY SCENARIO Like every organ system, the brain and its functions are shaped by genetics, bythe biological milieu, and by exposures to protective and damaging forces. In an ideal world, every new life would begin with two physically and psycho- logically healthy parents, whose genetically close family is free of mental illness,mental retardation, and social pathology. In the real world, of course, genetically 145 BRAIN AND BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS2Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Estimation methodology for adults with serious mental illness.

In order to flourish, the fetus requires a well-nourished intrauterine life that is free of toxins, infections, and metabolic abnormalities. The pregnancy shouldthen culminate in a delivery free of infection, oxygen deficiency, and any formsof permanent damage. The human fetus is very sensitive to toxic and infectiousexposures, as well as to oxygen and nutritional deficiencies in utero. All tri-mesters of pregnancy can be vulnerable, but the first trimester is especially so,because the basic development of the central nervous system is most rapid then.Fetal insults during the second trimester have recently been associated withsomewhat higher risk of schizophrenia. (See the section on improving health in pregnancy in Chapter 3.) A mother's use of alcohol and illicit drugs during pregnancy, even in small amounts, can cause irreversible neurologic damage inthe fetus. Tobacco use leads to low birthweight babies who are at higher risk for brain damage, which, in turn, can lead to behavioral problems, includingattention-deficit hyperactivity disorders. Maternal infections or malnutritioncan have similar damaging effects. Before birth the only communication to the baby is through biochemical chan- nels, except for rare instances of physical bruising. Even psychosocial \"events\" canonly reach the baby in the uterus through biochemical, endocrine, and cytokinechannels. After birth, all other environmental expressions\u2014sights, sounds, smells,feeding, touching, comforting, people's expressed emotions, recognition of ges-tures and language\u2014communicate to the infant and influence the brain's synap-tic connections, neurotransmitter responses, and endocrine ebb and flow. Theproducts of these processes receive the more familiar names of knowing, feeling,thinking, and expecting. Nurturing takes several forms: providing milk and food to meet nutritional needs; passing on the mother's antibodies and other immune substances throughbreast milk to \"program\" the infant's immunological system; and providingcomforting, security, love, relief of discomfort and pain, and stimulation to pro-gram the neural and psychological systems. Interestingly, social nurturing canlessen the effects of biological limitations, and learning to cope can protect fromsocial stress. The system is integrated. New research into the molecular biology of brain function demonstrates that early deprivation of mothering changes the brain chemical levels in both ani-mals and humans. Elevations in cortisol and deficits in serotonin can continuefor years in human children. In baby rats, those with environments that havestimulation by peers and objects to manipulate develop 30% more nerve cellconnections in their brains than those caged alone. It even appears that a verynurturing mother (at least in rhesus monkeys) can modify the action\u2014and the 146 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 146size\u2014of genes in the infant brain. This finding runs against the long-held as- sumption that a person's genetic template remains immutable, except for raredamaging mutations (Suomi, 1999). Positive interpersonal, social, cultural, and ideological environments can teach an infant to trust, love, care for others, and have hope for the future; the con-verse can instill fear, hurt, despair, suspicion, anger, and the expectation thatother people are threatening. A child's immediate family is critical\u2014it shouldscreen and protect the child from damaging stimuli and experiences early in life, guarding the child until basic trust, values, and attitudes have been well-established, before gradually, and in dosages that the child can handle, exposinghim or her to more destructive aspects of reality. Parents can extend their nurturing of mental and physical health by selecting safe, dependable, gentle, and child-centered child care, whether inside or out-side the home. A child\u2014in fact, everyone\u2014learns more quickly and enduringlywhen rewarded for desirable responses, rather than when punished for undesir-able ones. And not only are specific behaviors learned, but also attitudes towardothers, objects, and themselves that can make individuals and groups eager andable to continue positive learning throughout life. For older children and adolescents, the family and community can encouragetheir building peer groups with con-structive values and behaviors and dis-courage their association with harmfulgroups. Schools and communities, too,can work to limit the intrusion of displays of violence, destructive health habits,and antisocial values and behavior into young people's lives, influences thatoften come through mass media. To their own detriment, people of all ages tendto copy those behaviors that appear to be glamorous or immediately gratifyingrather than those that are most beneficial in the long run. Just as good parent-ing prevents children from eating poisoned food, so it should prevent themfrom consuming poisoned ideas. TEASING OUT THE CAUSES OF BRAIN AND BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS In the mid-1990s, the United States Institute of Medicine published Reducing Risks for Mental Disorders: Frontiers for Preventive Intervention Research . Based on extensive scientific review, the authors recommended preventive programs formental disorders that relied on the same strategy that has proven so successfulwith other diseases\u2014the reduction of risk factors and the increase of protective 147 BRAIN AND BEHAVIORAL DISORDERSA child's immediate family is critical\u2014 it should screen and protect the childfrom damaging stimuli and experiencesearly in life.51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 147factors on a community-wide scale (Mrazek and Haggerty (eds.), 1994). This publication addresses five illustrative disorders\u2014conduct disorders, depression,alcohol abuse, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. In addition, three moreconditions are responsible for much loss of healthy life years worldwide\u2014self-inflicted injuries, violence, and bipolar disorder (Murray and Lopez, 1996). Be-cause these eight disorders have overlapping risk and protective factors, thischapter will present preventive strategies for their general \"contributing causesand partial protectors,\" rather than trying to deal with each diagnosis separately. The very nature of behavioral and mental disorders makes it difficult to study them, to identify their specific causes and cures over repeated studies, to treatthem successfully, and, certainly, to prevent them. But these research and pre-vention difficulties are informative in and of themselves, because they help iden-tify the processes that underlie the most common neuropsychiatric disorders:(1) the involvement of multiple contributing causes, no one or two of which areessential for the disease to occur; (2) the interaction of damaging and protectivefactors such that some protective factors can cancel out the effects of some riskfactors, and vice versa; and (3) the common sources of influence for behavioraland neuropsychiatric disorders in most populations. These interacting forces aredetailed in the box below. 148 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHSOURCES THAT INFLUENCE THE RISK OF BRAIN AND BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS Genetic strengths and vulnerabilities; Intrauterine environment; Perinatal circumstances; Neuropsychological integrity vs. deficits; Chronic physical illness or injury disability vs. average health; A child's temperament and adaptability (easy vs. difficult); A child's ability to learn (intelligence); Parental care (quality, quantity, consistency); Family environment (including siblings, crowding, housing conditions); Social context (average or disadvantaged, including or lacking infrastructure); Community stability vs. disorganization (e.g., crime, broken families, transience); Quality of schools (e.g., safe, stimulating, responsive to local needs); Peer group relationships: nature of supports and values; Continuing attachment to parents and others in extended family; Social support from caring friends; and Cultural-ideological exposures. Another problem inherent to neuropsychiatric research is that any specific, pre- existing deficit that is coupled with any specific immediate trauma or stressorcan release different symptom profiles and, hence, different diagnoses. For ex-ample, long continuing parent-child conflict is a risk factor for depression, al-cohol abuse, and conduct disorder; and low education is reported to be more51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 148common in persons who develop alcohol dependence, depression, and, much later, Alzheimer's disease. While there remain many loose ends and paradoxes in the current state of re- search knowledge\u2014and all suggestions here deserve more definitive proof\u2014wecan still unequivocally say that: \"Deficits and traumas, when not offset by enough of the right protective influences, raise the risk of mental disorders in general; andsuch disorders can take many forms of expression.\" Although this assertion is scientifically loose and incomplete, it still provides some guidance for interventions. The following analogy perhaps can help toilluminate its utility. As any small-boat sailor knows, a tropical storm can sink his craft, but he also knows that a good pump to bail out water will help keep the boat afloat. Let'ssay strong gusty winds and waves come and sink the boat. The sailor may notknow exactly which wave made the final difference, which wind gust tipped theboat too far, or what, if anything, was wrong with the pump. Nevertheless, thesailor has learned some important lessons in \"sinking prevention and survivalpromotion,\" namely: to avoid extremely strong winds (stay in port, stay down-wind of a high cliff); avoid extremely high waves (stay in shallower water); keepwater out of the boat (install sideboards to keep most water from getting intothe hull, get a stronger pump); or resort to a combination of the above. To date, research into mental disorders is in much the same boat. The details\u2014 was it a wave or a wind that sank the boat?\u2014predict almost nothing specific.Moreover, relatively few mental disorder prevention programs with rigorous de-sign have proven such details beyond doubt. Nevertheless, the principles pre-sented here may serve as lighthouses by offering general directions for futureresearch and pilot programs. Suppose there were a comprehensive prenatal and perinatal program that could reach every population segment in a province\u2014rich and poor, urban and rural,minorities and majorities. If the program reaches 20,000 pregnant women andprevents 1,000 prenatal viral infections, 1,000 toxic exposures to alcohol, tobacco,or drugs, and 500 delivery complications, these 2,500 \"preventions\" might, inturn, prevent two or three schizophrenias, a handful of conduct disorders, 20mental deficiencies, and a dozen each of alcohol dependencies and chronic de-pressive disorders. Such a maternal health program is not the answer to prevent-ing mental disorders or to preventing congenital anomalies, but it is a step in boththese directions, and perhaps more. Preventing more mental disorders will taketime and many other small steps. Social change advances just that way: manysmall steps by many people (physicians, nurses, women, men, community offi- 149 BRAIN AND BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 149cials, teachers, mass media) in many places. Indeed, the whole process of disease prevention and health promotion is one of social and behavioral change. ELEVEN CROSSROADS WHERE RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS MEET4 Just as an inspiring mosaic can be assembled from shovels-full of small, scat- tered, colorful stones, a mosaic of improved mental health can be created bymany people coming together to share their vision, insight, and flexibility. Areview of the research literature identifies eleven circumstances\u2014times orplaces\u2014in which risk of mental disorders can be changed. By counteracting riskand moving toward protection at each crossroad, family and community men-tal health can be improved. GENETIC STRENGTHS AND VULNERABILITIES Couples usually have children who look much like themselves and who alsoshare their temperament and mental skills. When people select mates similar tothemselves, this can either double the benefit or double the trouble, especially if both mates carry genetic deficiencies(for field study data see Reddy, in Hos-king and Murphy (eds.), 1987). The ge-netic transmission of neuropsychiatricvulnerability raises the chances for devel-oping major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, alcohol abuse, or severe mental deficiency. Genetic factors arenot \"simple causes\" of these disorders, however; they merely \"tilt the table\" to-ward or away from these health outcomes. Self-inflicted injury and suicide usu-ally occur in a context of major depression, and they show some familial aggre-gation, often via copying the behavior of some other family member. There alsois some evidence that criminality may be inheritable as well as learned. Manyanatomic and physiologic attributes also are at least partially determined by ge-netic influences\u2014and these, in turn, shape behavior. What can be done in terms of prevention? For those already born, programs can attempt to reduce the harmful genetic influence by increasing protective factorsin the physical and human environments. It must always be kept in mind thatfor many conditions that do not involve dominant genes, half or more of off-spring will not manifest their parents' condition, especially where the conditionis determined by multiple gene locations. Genetic predisposition is neither a 150 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH4Many resources contributed to this section. Of special note were Mrazek and Haggerty (eds.), 1994; Matzen and Lang (eds.), 1993, especially Chapter 10, by Bennetts; and Rutter, 1985.A mosaic of improved mental health can be created by many people coming together to share their vision, insight, and flexibility.51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 150necessary nor sufficient explanation for the majority of mental disorders in any community. Dealing with this source of risk cannot be the cornerstone of acomprehensive preventive program. THE INTRAUTERINE ENVIRONMENT The uterus is one of the safest environments most persons have ever had, withthe mother's body providing an extraordinary degree of protection from physi-cal, chemical, and microbiological insults. The fetus's nutritional needs are, forthe most part, well covered. Minor deficiencies in the mother's diet can be com-pensated for by calling on reserves from the mother's body. Major or protracteddeficiencies will exact a price from both the mother and the fetus, so adequatenutrition is essential for both physical and neuropsychological health. The mother's acquired immunities will be passed on to the fetus, but new infections that the mother's system cannot neutralize will affect the baby. Con-sequently, a prospective mother must be immunized prior to pregnancy to pre-vent permanent damage from rubella, tetanus, and STIs (including syphilis,gonorrhea, chlamydia, HIV, and hepatitis B). Guidelines in obstetrical and in-fectious disease textbooks should be followed for the type and timing of immu-nizations and antitoxins. Toxins can pass through the placenta and damage the fetus. The most common toxins are byproducts of tobacco smoking, such as carbon monoxide, nicotine,and other carcinogens. Another is alcohol, which in small amounts causes minordamage to the fetal brain and in large amounts causes the permanently damag-ing fetal alcohol syndrome. \"Recreational\" or illegal drugs can be particularlytoxic, causing permanent neurological damage to the fetus. And sometimes,therapeutic medications also can be toxic to the fetus. Professionals giving pre-natal care should compile a list appropriate to the local situation. Moreover, folkremedies should be scrutinized carefully as some contain toxic metallic salts.Finally, eating non-food substances (i.e., clay or mud) might be harmful, de-pending on their chemistry. THE PERINATAL EXPERIENCE Carrying pregnancy to its full 40-week duration is important to the health ofmost of a baby's physiologic systems. Babies born prematurely or at low weightfor fetal age are very vulnerable. Low birthweight babies (under 2,500 g) are atrisk for congenital anomalies, respiratory distress, and neurobehavioral compli-cations. Low birthweight babies have twice the risk of later behavior problemsin school and school failure as do normal weight babies. When combined witha high-risk social environment, low birthweight babies' risk soars to fourfold 151 BRAIN AND BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 151that of normal weight babies. Low birthweight also has been associated with mental deficiency, cerebral palsy, and higher infant mortality. Delivery complications include protracted duration of delivery leading to anoxia; toxic or infectious exposures; instrumental deliveries that put excessivepressure on the baby's soft skull; and too early or too heavy use of anesthetics,analgesics, or oxytoxics. An impaired fetus also may complicate delivery. It is easyto see how each of these could damage the brain, a baby's most vulnerable organ. All the circumstances discussed, as well as other, less common ones, can lead to neuropsychological deficits, but fortunately they do not always do so. Whensuch deficit occurs, however, it becomes a general risk factor for later behavioraland mental problems of various forms (Mrazek and Haggerty, 1994). COPING WITH CHRONIC ILLNESS OR INJURY DISABILITY These conditions weaken overall resilience and adaptive capacity, and expose ayoung child to the stress of medical care, restricted activity, and hospitalizationaway from parents and home. This stress has been associated with a double totriple increase in the risk of conduct disorder and with a significant, but perhapsweaker, association with future depression. Childhood is a high-risk time for in-juries due to vehicles, falls, poisonings, and child abuse. These frequently leavepost-traumatic stress disorders in their wake. If such trauma leaves a baby, child,or youth disfigured or disabled, that, too, will leave enduring psychological, in-terpersonal, and perhaps occupational limitations. Repeated blows to the head can be disabling: shaking or banging of the head at any age can cause concussions of varying severity and small hemorrhages in thebrain. Moreover, young men who get involved in street fighting or boxing maysustain repeated blows to the head that could cause brain damage (\"dementia 152 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHHOW TO COPE WITH THE RISKS OF CHRONIC ILLNESS OR DISABILITY Find a child's special skill and encourage it, so the child can build self-esteem based on that talent. Stay as close as possible with the child during medical treatments or hospitalizations to minimize separation anxiety. Involve the child in activities with other children, so that he does not feel isolated or different. Encourage the child fully to use his or her capabilities and skills. Maintain behavioral expectations and rules appropriate to the child's limitations and capacities, so as to build self-control and a sense of responsibility. Seriously retarded or autistic youngsters who may bang their heads repeatedly should wear protective head coverings, or nearby surfaces should be covered with padding.51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 152pugilistica\"), which raises the risk for early Alzheimer's dementia. Obviously, this, too, is preventable. TEMPERAMENT AND ADAPTABILITY The determinants of temperament still live in the caves of the unknown. Neu- rologic damage is one accepted cause of irritability, shortened attention span,easy loss of emotional control in the face of frustration, and unpredictable lossof temper, yet these problems spread far beyond those persons with any suspi-cion of neural damage. Temperament and adaptability are not easily changeable, it seems, but they can help chart the course for successful parenting. Clearly, a difficult child who isless adaptable to change requires more thoughtful, more adaptable, and morepersevering parenting. And, because such children's capacities to adapt can varygreatly in the course of the day, parents\u2014and eventually teachers\u2014must stayalert to the child's emotional and coping status at a given moment. They muststart at that point, and work incrementally to build, over time, the child's ca-pacity to cope with and master more and different situations, praising the childfor calmness, self-control, and problem-solving efforts. ABILITY TO LEARN This capacity refers not only to \"booklearning,\" but also to emotional learning,self-management, and social learning ininteraction with adults and children. Basicintelligence is, of course, of major impor-tance, but even if cognitive capacity is be-low average, it may be other factors thatlimit what is actually learned. Emotionallability, attention deficits, or hyperactivity may be controlled with medicationor conditioning procedures, so as to open the child to full use of his/her cogni-tive capacities. PARENTAL CARE Parenting and family relations include the interactions of mother and father witheach other and with each child; the relations of brothers and sisters with one an-other; and the involvement of relatives, other household members, and the ex-tended family; plus the total environment parents provide for the children\u2014physical, biological, interpersonal, socioeconomic, and cultural-ideological. 153 BRAIN AND BEHAVIORAL DISORDERSLearning means replacing old ideas, feelings, and behaviors with new onesthat bring positive rewards or reducediscomforts. Learning is the key todeveloping into a whole person, tobecoming able to adapt more easily toa changing self in a changing world.51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 153The United States Institute of Medicine Committee on the Prevention of Men- tal Disorders in 1994 implicated deficient or disturbed parenting in raising therisk for major depression, conduct disorders (behavioral disorders), and alcoholabuse. Most studies cannot separate the fraction of risk conferred by geneticsfrom the fraction transmitted by experiencing troubled parenting or conflicts inthe home; nevertheless, the frequency of more serious disorders in young peo-ple who have not had a family history of related problems argues that the psy-chosocial aspects of family relations by themselves can confer serious risk. Instructive research conducted mostly in industrialized countries shows that boys who grow up in single-mother families display more aggressive behaviors andmore school learning problems than boys from the same neighborhoods who livewith both parents. Families headed by a mother, living with a male partner whois neither the child's parent nor the mother's husband, generated even more ag-gressive behavior, on average, in young boys studied in United States communi-ties. Broken families also are detrimental to girls' adjustment and behavior, butless so. The functional pathways leading to these problems have not been proven,but lower income, parenting distress in the mother, and reduced adult supervi-sion of the children seem likely to be contributing causes (Pearson et al., 1994). Usually, the breakdowns in family structure cannot be prevented at the individ- ual level, but social and community policies and practices might be changed toreduce their overall frequency in the community. Where broken families arecommon in a community, the children exposed to this social risk can be sup-ported, in part, by such mentoring programs (usually non-governmental) ascommunity \"big brother/big sister\" programs, after-school skills and sports pro-grams led by caring adults, and fun programs sponsored by civic clubs or reli-gious groups that provide teaching, social skills training, and practice in be-havioral self-control. Such protective factors can often help compensate forunchangeable risk factors. The protective, health-promoting power of parental care cannot be overstated. Too often, when all other risk factors have been shown inapplicable, parents areblamed as the only remaining \"cause\" of an offspring's mental problems. Evenwhen true\u2014and often they are not\u2014such explanations are rarely therapeutic. Itis more useful instead to try to find ways to build healthier, happier, more stress-resistant people. Workers in this field emphasize three aspects of good parent-ing, as detailed below. Quality A parent's (and any adult's, for that matter) interaction with a child should behelpful and loving. Parents should be attuned to a child's developmental stage,personal strengths and weaknesses, and likes and dislikes. Adults' gestures shouldreach out, lift up, and lead along; they should not push forward, put down, dis- 154 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 154parage, or reject. The parent should provide structure and correction, yet be pa- tient. A parent's role is demanding and requires maturity. All the more reasonthat anyone who is still physically, mentally, or emotionally immature should bestrongly discouraged from having children. Quantity Children require a sufficient amount of personal interaction with friendly, giv- ing, noncompetitive others whom they can trust. These ingredients teach chil-dren who they themselves are. An uncertain, malleable mind-body is beingshaped into a person every waking and sleeping hour, and this happens by learn-ing, feeling, storing, and processing biopsychosocial memories. By definition,this requires time every day. Please handle with care! Provide enough interactionto fill the child's hunger for contact, meaning, acceptance, guidance, learning,and relearning. Babies and children differ greatly in their hunger for loving con-tact\u2014give accordingly. Consistency We all function better and save emotional energy if we know what to expect\u2014wecan then be ready for what's next. Uncertainty and fear make us feel at risk, tense,and rather ineffective or incompetent. Kids are no different, although they maynot be able to put it into words. Provide apredictable social environment in which it iseasy for a child to learn what to do. A child can predict\u2014adapt, even\u2014to a parent who is always emotionally cold, orto a parent who is always too busy to payattention. But it becomes much tougherwhen the parent swings unpredictably fromwarm to cold, from overly attentive to rejecting. Adult situations and feelingscan, of course, change day to day, but parents should openly explain this to chil-dren in age appropriate ways. For younger children\u2014indeed, for anybody\u2014itis vital to communicate, especially nonverbally, that whatever happens inside oroutside the family, the constancy of caring and valuing between parent and chil-dren does not change. Fortunately, parents need not \"be cured\" of their own problems and weaknesses. It is enough that they be taught\u2014with their motivation being the main limit-ing factor\u2014to: seek help when they or their children can benefit from it\u2014they shouldn'twait until the situation becomes a crisis; 155 BRAIN AND BEHAVIORAL DISORDERSUsually, the breakdowns in family structure cannot be prevented at the individual level, but social andcommunity policies and practices mightbe changed to reduce their overallfrequency in the community.51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 155set aside as much of their weaknesses and turmoil as possible from their in- teraction with their children; seek social support in their parenting and get information, practical help(baby-sitting, doing an errand), emotional support (sharing feelings), and asense of belonging to a group (of parents or grandparents, of neighbors orfriends) who have faced, or are facing, similar family problems. An advantage of an extended family, or its urban equivalent of close relations among neighboring families, is that if one parent has a problem or weakness, orone child has a special need, other adults can \"fill in\" to meet those needs. Ifboth parents work outside the home, grandparents, biological or adopted, canfill in needed parenting. The Western \"nuclear\" family style, with one or twoparents and one or more children living alone far from other concerned and car-ing people, is a particularly vulnerable arrangement. FAMILY AND SOCIAL CONTEXT Parents also are responsible for ensuring that anything that comes in contactwith the family is safe and friendly to growth. The home should protect againstextreme temperature, rain, or snow and must be filled with clean air; keep outinsects, rodents, and vectors of disease; and be free of wastes, poisons, and causesof injury (also see Chapter 3) . Each child also needs to be nurtured long enough as \"the baby of the family,\" in order to grow and develop physically,emotionally, and cognitively to adapt adequately to the coming of the next baby.T wo or more years is the recommended interval. Siblings need to have parentsshow them by example how to be caring, loving, and supportive of each other. The value of the home's cultural-ideological atmosphere cannot be quantified\u2014 it is priceless. Things that money can buy, such as modern appliances and tele-visions\u2014are not part of the family culture. Rather, family culture is made up ofattitudes, ways of relating, behaviors, and expectations regarding others' re-sponses\u2014values that can overcome poverty and community chaos, and helpbuild healthy children and adults. If young children are cared for outside thehome, these settings, too, should show the same qualities. These outside settingscan sometimes even offset deficiencies in the culture of the home by providinga caring consistent experience. The safe and nurturing home or place of care isa stronghold of protection against many sources of risk. A safe, comfortable neighborhood with a high proportion of friendly inter- actions clearly provides a protective factor (now called social capital), but povertyby itself need not be a risk factor for mental or physical disorder. This has beenshown repeatedly in many poor rural areas or poor ethnic sections in cities,which held onto their community and family integration and promoted health 156 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 156and well being. A community's social capital is composed of a shared sense of re- sponsibility for others, trust in others, willingness to help others, and social par-ticipation. High social capital nurtures healthy psychosocial growth at all ages. SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT The transition from home or day-care setting to school is an important step ingrowing up. Children's distress in making this step can be reduced by caringteachers and by keeping classes relatively small\u2014the pupil-teacher ratio shouldbe lower in the first year than in later years. The teacher\u2014as does the mother\u2014has a labor intensive job, and small classes help ensure every child's successfultransition into community-living. Parents and teachers should recognize that achild has much to learn emotionally and interpersonally at ages 5 to 6 years, andthat children's readiness varies greatly at these ages. The school's responsibility goes far beyond imparting information to children. Perhaps its most important task is to teach children how to interact comfortablyand cooperate constructively with one another. Studies by personnel depart-ments of large businesses have typically shown that about 80% of those firedfrom their jobs have been discharged for interpersonal or behavioral reasons;fewer than 20% are dismissed for lack of skills. Clearly, schools must do a bet-ter job with social learning. Schools also must teach children how to keep onlearning after they finish school. This is more essential than ever if schools areto prepare children for life in a changing world. Good schools have been shownby research to be a positive ingredient for mental health. A body of research already shows that risk factors can be identified, as early as age 6 years, which foretell higher rates of antisocial behavior, delinquency, andillicit drug and tobacco use. Chief among these risk predictors are aggressive,oppositional behavior and poor school performance, particularly if it is associ-ated with attention deficit or lack of self-control (reviewed in Mrazek and Hag-gerty, 1994; see also Kellam and Anthony, 1998, regarding several large longi-tudinal studies on children from major United States cities). This raises thequestion of whether screening for higher risk of adolescent behavior problemsshould be done in the first year or two of primary school, at ages 5-7 years. Ofcourse, screening is useless unless follow-up is provided. A simple teacher-managed intervention\u2014the \"Good Behavior Game\"\u2014is avail- able, and it shows some promise. The game is described in full in the box on thenext page. PEER GROUPS Just before adolescence, a child begins to identify with a group of children about his or her age or slightly older as a preferred reference group\u2014this is the peer 157BRAIN AND BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 GAME\" The \"Good Behavior Game\" was developed in the late 1960s by H. H. Barrish and his colleagues (1969) and further developed by L. J. Dolan and his colleagues (1989). In brief(as described by Kellam and Anthony, 1998), it consists of dividing a classroom's childreninto small groups, say 6 to 8 children aged 5-8 years old. The groups should have roughlythe same number of girls and boys and the same proportion of unruly children, so no oneteam has an advantage. The teacher posts a list of undesirable classroom behaviors, suchas shouting, bullying another child, provoking a fight, damaging property, and talkingwhen silence is requested. Teams are rewarded when no team member lapses into anylisted undesirable behavior for the duration of the game. Simple rewards are given to thewinning team(s), such as stickers or badges, a pencil, a team banner, or a treat to eat.Teams where children exhibit negative behaviors receive one or two penalty points. None,some, or all teams may win the game. First the game is played for only 10 minute periods three times per week. Behaviors are rewarded or penalized only during these periods. Gradually, the game should be playedmore often, and, after more than one team regularly wins the 10-minute game, eachgame can be extended to 15 and then 20 minutes. At about this time rewards to winning teams can be shifted gradually away from individ- ual and material rewards to symbolic group rewards, such as being in temporary posses-sion of a banner or having the privilege of being first in a queue. After experiencingprompt rewards for a while, children become ready for longer intervals between successand reward. Scores of all the games played in a week can be totaled, and a weekly prizegiven, thus teaching the children to work longer and wait longer for a payoff. This makesthe game more like real life. Teachers should encourage the children to get involved in thegame by adding new or lesser misbehaviors to the forbidden list, making the game morechallenging and harder to win. Do not play the game throughout the school day. Good behavior is a conditioning and learning process, and its effects will naturally spread throughout the whole school day andeven outside the school setting.Teachers will observe an important side-benefit of thegame\u2014classroom behavior will improve overall. Kellam and Anthony (1998) followed children in two randomized trials of behavioral in- terventions given in the first grade (ages 5-6). They found that boys who had participated ineither the \"Good Behavior Game\" or a mastery learning program aimed at improving read-ing, were significantly less likely to have started smoking tobacco by age 14, compared toboys receiving only the usual classroom teaching. The interventions also produced differ-ences among girls, but these were not adequately measured. It should be noted that neitherof the interventions tested made a direct mention of tobacco use. Evaluating the impact ofthese interventions on other outcomes, such as school dropout or delinquent behavior inadolescence, must await longer follow-up through the high-risk years for each outcome. This example has been presented in detail here, in order:to allow for cross-cultural testing of the approach; to stimulate the search early in childhood for risk factors for behavioral and psychosocial problems which can be modified through intervention; to test local and cultural adaptations of the game to see if they improve behavior; to determine whether such immediate changes actually reduce problems in subsequent years; and to show possible ways whereby primary schools can screen and provide corrective learn- ing to reduce the risk and severity of future mental and behavioral health problems. This is true primary prevention given to entire classrooms of average children.51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 158group. The group likes to spend idle time together, with its members absorbing mutual likes and dislikes, learning new vocabulary (not always adult-approved),and trying out behaviors different from those at home. Peers become not only a source for social relationships, but a mirror for the culture and for eachchild in the group to see him- or herself. Youths try to reshape themselves to be more acceptable in their peers' mirror,and as they do that, they may start to lookdistorted from an adult's perspective. Peergroup influence can lead to conduct disor-ders, alcohol or drug abuse, and varioustroubled behaviors. Thus, parents, teachers, and any others who care about children\u2014as well as theyouths themselves\u2014must help developpeer groups that share a pro-community,pro-future set of values and a supportive, affirming style of relating. Fortunately,there are many such groups active in most of the world, usually sponsored byschools, organizations that strive for community improvement, and religiousgroups. These groups organize appealing activities and provide adult guidance,scheduling, and other elements of structure, but remain flexible enough to adapt the program to the interests of local girls and boys. Small, informal clusters of young friends are just as important, and perhaps even more so, in developing social and emotional skills, current interests, and futuregoals. Parents can work with other parents to influence the composition and ac-tivities of their children's circle of friends, especially by teaching young peopleskills, sports, games, or by organizing activities such as hiking, swimming, oragricultural projects (like the 4H Clubs in the United States). Parents can par-ticipate jointly in the activities until the young people have acquired enoughskills to carry the activities on their own. These experiences build beliefs in self-efficacy (\"I can do it\") and self-esteem (\"I'm OK\")\u2014both beliefs are protectiveagainst future stressors. ATTACHMENT TO PARENTS AND MENTORS The above suggestion for adults to coach and participate with youth sets thestage for continuing positive relationships between generations\u2014a boon for allinvolved. We all need helpful, supportive, uplifting people around us. Manyepidemiologic studies show that people living in isolation develop more ill-nesses, both mental and physical, and are more likely to die sooner than peoplewho regularly interact with others. Each generation has special strengths it canoffer the others. Each generation has vulnerabilities for which it needs the helpof the others. 159 BRAIN AND BEHAVIORAL DISORDERSThe peer-group mirror\u2014much like a carnival or amusement park lookingglass\u2014often can distort the child's self-image and even can reflect agrotesque version of the surroundingenvironments, the school, and thefamily.51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 159SUMMING UP THE CROSSROADS Each of the eleven critical stages discussed above is a window of opportunity, of- fering the choice for protection or damage. In each one, health workers, com-munity leaders, and, most of all, local citizens, can overcome the pressures to-ward poor health or, conversely, build structures to enhance positive health.There is no one magic pill to promote mental health. It will take many people,working on many fronts year by year to construct the delicate mosaic of betterhealth that our children and grandchildren deserve. RESTRUCTURING TREATMENT SYSTEMS When preventive interventions fail, treatment programs are essential, of course. But where prevention has not been seriously tried, the mildly mentally ill haveno other recourse than to have their conditions deteriorate until they end up incustodial treatment, often in crowded hospitals. This means that in many coun-tries, nearly the entire mental health budget is spent on mental hospitals. Thislimited care for severe cases is costly per patient and has a poor prognosis for re-habilitating patients; it also leaves nearly no funds for launching effective pre-ventive programs for a much larger group of people. With the discovery of more effective psychiatric drugs, more hospitalized pa- tients can live comfortably and safely in halfway houses in the community, usu-ally at a much lower cost. Others can return to live with their families, who makesure the patient takes his/her medications as prescribed. Most relapses of psychi-atric patients living in the community are due to failure to take drugs as pre-scribed. Although many of the newer psychiatric drugs are quite costly, an in- creasing number of them are coming off-patentafter the year 2000. At that time, they can thenbe made generically by any advanced pharma-ceutical laboratory at a lower cost to the con-sumer. Governmental agencies, too, can negoti-ate contracts for system-wide use of such drugsin large quantities and at much lower prices. Neither mental hospitals, nor psychiatric drugs, nor psychotherapy has ever been able to reach even a small fraction of the people who need them, however.And this will worsen as the frequency of behavioral and psychiatric problemsballoons as we move toward the year 2020. Prevention, early local treatment,and cost-containment are the appropriate paths to the future. PAHO has called for a restructuring of mental health services in Latin America and has laid out its technical basis. This reform calls for decentralizing care forincipient and manageable psychiatric disorders by linking these outpatients to 160 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHMany countries spend nearly all of their mental health budget on mental hospitals. Prevention, early local treatment, and cost-containment are more appropriate paths to the future.51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 160local primary health care programs. PAHO recommends a pyramid of mental health services based on self-help groups and social support networks, with re-ferral upwards as needed to health promoters, nurses, primary care facilities,and, finally, to psychologists and psychiatrists if necessary. The goal is to addmore resources (non-hospital) to community care, in order to decrease the fre-quency of hospitalizations. The savings achieved by requiring fewer hospitalbeds can be used to pay for mental health workers in primary health care clin-ics and for teachers and social workers to do primary prevention outreach of thetypes described here. This approach to psychiatric and behavioral care is worth serious consideration in many parts of the world. It may seem revolutionary, but with traditional ter-tiary care having woefully failed, only bold new directions hold the hope forcontaining a rising tide of disorders (Levav, Restrepo, and de Macedo, 1994). RECOGNIZING AND DEALING WITH DEPRESSION In its mild forms depression is the common cold of mental life. In more severeforms, according to the GBD Study, it causes an estimated 50 million life yearsof disability (YLD) worldwide each year. Depression is a continuum: it comes in all shades of gray. And depression is truly a biopsychosocial disorder\u2014its signs and symptoms involve biochemistry, emo-tions, cognitions, and personal interactions. Successful treatment uses all theselevels of input. Business leaders should know that depressive symptoms anddisorders steal billions of dollars, euros, and pesos from every country's grossnational product by forcing workers and managers to take days or weeks off from work, or in milder forms by reducing the quality and quantity of workperformed. Everyone experiences brief episodes of sadness, discouragement, feeling slowed down, or grief after a personal loss. Most people are able to keep on going withtheir usual responsibilities and activities, although perhaps with less energy andmore feeling of burden. Soon, most begin feeling better, more capable, and re-gain their usual enthusiasm. But some do not. RISK FACTORS Professionals agree about the risk factors for depressive episodes. Here are sixmajor ones (Mrazek and Haggerty, 1994, p. 502): having a first-degree biological relative (for example, a parent, grandparent,or sibling) with a depressive mood disorder; 161 BRAIN AND BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 161experiencing a severe stressor, such as the death or loss of a close person, mar- ital trouble, job loss, medical crisis, or family or community disaster; believing oneself to be incapable, helpless (being a victim), hopeless, unac-ceptable to others, and unworthy; being female (much higher risk for unknown reasons); living in poverty or in a powerless social position; and having a severe physical illness of a type that may have an impact on brainchemistry. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Mood: sad, discouraged, irritable, loss of interest in favorite things, giving up, hopeless, crying spells, and troubled appearance. Physiology: loss of energy or appetite, slowed movements. Sleep disturbances: trouble falling asleep, multiple awakenings during the night, waking up far too early, waking up tired and worn out after one's usualamount of sleep. And conversely, regularly sleeping too much (10+ hours),and having trouble staying awake; feeling chronically exhausted. Cognition: trouble concentrating, slowed decision-making, trouble finishing tasks, feeling everything is going wrong, making more mistakes in work. Thinking about death: dwelling on family or friends who have died, seeing death as an escape. Social: person shifts to being more passive, dependent, helpless, sensitive to criticism; feels unloved, lonely, argues and complains more; may increasealcohol use. Co-morbidity: anxiety symptoms accompany depression in perhaps 70% of episodes (estimates differ greatly by culture). This brings on restlessness, fidget-ing, pacing, fearfulness, short attention span, much worrying, inability to relax. PREVALENCE Primary care doctors and clinics can expect that 20% to 40% of patients will carry depression secondary to the physical problem they came to have treated. 162 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 162Commonly, the depressive physiology: lowers the threshold for reporting body symptoms, aggravates pain, and contributes to the physiological changes behindthe presenting problem. In the community, the prevalence of depression is notas high as the percentage among doctors' patients, but many times greater intotal numbers. Most depressive signs go unrecognized by health workers. Infact, were it not that way, there would be no time or resources left to deal withother diseases and injuries. This section intends to: Alert health workers to the many forms depression can take and its overallprevalence and burden in the community, Assess whether the presence of depression in a patient or family is interferingwith successful treatment of other conditions (e.g., is a child failing to takeher medications regularly because her mother is too depressed to supervise?),and Identify more accurately persons with major depression, which can become afatal condition, and be proactive in treating them. THE BRIGHT SIDE: SECONDARY PREVENTION THROUGH EARLY TREATMENT The good news is that depression is treatable, and sometimes it is preventable. The bad news is that only about 25% to 35% of depressed people in industri-alized nations seek help directly for thatproblem, and the numbers are far lower inrural, poor, or developing areas. Yet, withproper treatment about 80% of personssuffering from depression obtain substan-tial improvement. Many classes of antidepressant drugs are available by prescription. If one drug is noteffective, it is likely that another class ofdrug will help, because each class worksthrough different biochemical channels.The newest such drugs are always the mostexpensive and out of the financial reach of many health care systems, but manyolder medications no longer have patent protection and can be made and soldmore cheaply. They too work well, perhaps nearly as effectively for most patients. And there are other ways to prevent or lessen depression that are easily available. They can be done with groups and they are easily exportable. Inexpensive, suc-cessful programs with broad outreach are already going on in some places. 163 BRAIN AND BEHAVIORAL DISORDERSSocially and clinically important depression occurs: when symptoms get so troubling asto interfere with normal work andfamily activities, daily activities, andinteractions with others; when symptoms drag on for weeksor months, either worsening or notimproving; or when a person considers violentaction against himself or others.51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 163Physical Exercise. Physical exercise for an hour or more daily (several ses- sions or several hours work better) changes brain endorphins and other neu-rochemicals\u2014nature's antidepressants. Many psychiatric hospitals now pre-scribe walking and other activities for depressed patients who are adequatelynourished. A brisk physical workout or a longer run can give an adrenalinehigh, but even a more modest kilometer walk daily can lift sadness, as manypeople in their later years will attest. More Daylight. Environments on the polar sides of the temperate zones have longer summer days, but also long winter nights. Extended exposure to dark-ness changes brain chemistry such that many people develop a higher risk ofdepression. This is called \"Seasonal Affective Disorder.\" Centers that treatsuch depressed patients, particularly in Northern Europe and Canada, havethem spend hours in brightly-lighted rooms. Increasingly, these treatmentcenters also employ exercise. Following this example, many factories and of-fices in higher latitudes are increasing the brightness of illumination in win-ter as a preventive measure against depression. (Reports of clinical studies canshed light on intensity, wave-length, duration, and safety issues regarding thisapproach.) Re-thinking One's Situation. Several cognitive therapies have developed principles and methods for treating depression. In randomized clinical trialsevaluating drug therapy and cognitive therapy individually and both together,versus \"wait-list\" controls (i.e., neither treatment), the two therapies haverather similar results: each is better than no treatment; combined therapy isonly a little better than only one modality; and cognitive therapy in somestudies has a longer lasting effect than medications. Special training is neededto conduct these therapies effectively, even for psychiatrists and psychologists. Cognitive therapists argue that most depressive reactions result from the way people think about their problems and themselves. When the therapist can helppatients change the way they think about defeat, loss, helplessness, and theirown capacities, symptoms of depression are relieved and the person has learneda defense against future stressful events and losses. Cognitive therapists find that depressed patients commonly have three distorted ways of perceiving their situation. They overgeneralize or inflate their currentproblems so as to believe: that everything is going wrong in their lives; that they are to blame (guilt, self-criticism, worthlessness); and that things will never get better (no relief ahead, helplessness and hope-lessness). 164 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 164In simple terms, therapy's goal is to reverse all of these presumptions. To extend this therapy to preventive hygiene, children and adults can be taught, throughdiscussion and example: that there are always good things remaining in life and about oneself. that troubles have multiple causes, and the person is not the cause of all badthings. Next time I can do my part better. I am still accepted. \"To err ishuman.\" that right now is not forever. The person can change and others can change,too\u2014\"this (problem), too, will pass\" and others can help. 5 Additional cognitive therapy approaches appear successful in reducing both de-pressive symptoms and the risk of qualifying for the diagnosis of major depres-sive disorder (unipolar depression). G. N. Clark and colleagues (1995) ran-domized 150 high-school teenagers with elevated depression scores to either anuntreated group or to group therapy consisting of 15 sessions of 45 minuteseach. The goals were to help students identify and challenge negative or irra-tional thoughts that foster depression, to promote higher self-esteem and bettercoping skills, and to participate in more pleasurable activities. One-year follow-up showed that only 15% of the treated group incurred episodes of clinical de-pression, whereas 26% of the untreated adolescents became clinically depressed. A meta-analysis of 48 high quality randomized controlled trials (765 patients) showed cognitive therapy for depression to be clearly more effective than notreatment (that is, waiting for time to heal) or drug treatment alone. Eight fur-ther studies showed that after completion of treatment, patients having only an-tidepressant drug therapy relapsed sooner than those patients who had cognitivetherapy with or without medication (Gloaguen et al., 1998). A subsequent summary of four additional controlled clinical trials of patients in primary care clinics in the United Kingdom showed similar results (Rowland etal., 2001). Several varieties of cognitive therapies have been found useful in sec-ondary prevention of depression, including cognitive behavioral therapy, familytherapies, and non-directive supportive approaches (Kolko et al., 2000). 6In the case of depression\u2014as well as for many other medical conditions\u2014different in-dividuals respond best to different treatment methods. It has long been recognized that depressions, as well as more severe disorders such as psychoses, involve important biological changes. Research into brain 165 BRAIN AND BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS5See also Seligman, 1991. 6The following have been some of the leading resources for cognitive therapies: Beck, Rush, Shaw, and Emery, 1979; Seligman, 1991 (more oriented to lay readers). For clinical field trials:Manning and Francis (eds.), 1990.51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 165chemistry and new methods of brain imaging continue to bring forth surprising new information, accompanied by a host of new psychotropic medications foranxiety disorders, schizophrenias, and depressions. Unfortunately, most of thesedrugs remain too expensive for use among the tens of millions of people whoneed them. Where clinically appropriate and economically feasible, pharmaceu-tical treatment should be considered, especially when careful medical supervi-sion is available. Very often the best treatment for individual cases may involvea combination of verbal and drug therapies. Each nation and province mustcarefully consider what kinds of therapies to make available widely, based on epi-demiologic studies of needs and types of resources most feasible to develop. Depression is expected to become the world's leading cause of disability in 2020. Interested readers are referred to psychiatry textbooks that provide much morethorough coverage of this topic. This section closes with a brief description offour well-defined pieces of the puzzle of depression. While medical practiceawaits additional pieces of knowledge, health promoters can perform small,careful field trials based on the suggestions outlined below. Brain Chemistry. Neurotransmitters, endorphins, and amines are among the organic chemicals whose imbalances may cause or aggravate depression. An-tidepressant medications work by various mechanisms to rebalance the sys-tem, and behaviors also can change this chemistry. Both drugs and behaviorscan affect depression triggered either by neurochemical imbalances or by psy-chosocial stress. Interpersonal Interaction. Having someone with whom to share problems, from whom to receive encouragement and acceptance, and who can be thesource of new ideas or practical help, has proven to be good therapy for cen-turies, both to prevent the thinking that encourages depression and to relievemost situationally triggered depressive episodes. For the last 40 years we havecalled this social support; in prior centuries it was called having good familyor having good neighbors. This is an avenue by which families, communitygroups, and religious organizations can help to prevent and relieve depres-sion, anxiety, and other of the less severe emotional problems. Psychosocial Shock or Stress. People who have undergone severe stressors or losses (see \"Risk Factors,\" above) are particularly vulnerable to depressiveepisodes in the 6 to 12 months following the stress. Bereavement often en-genders depression from which most people recover over time. Providing sup-port groups or other contact to these people on a routine basis appears to bean effective preventive measure. Loneliness and Depersonalization in a Changing World. In this age of mi- gration, flow of refugees, shortage of jobs near family homes, family breakup,and troubled, fearful neighborhoods, new ways are needed to provide social 166 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 166support. For example, community vol- unteer groups or religious gatherings canfurther this work. Clearly, high technol-ogy cannot solve the worldwide epi-demic of loneliness. In fact, some formsof technology\u2014television, Internet ac-cess, and even the trend toward high-tech, impersonal medical care\u2014actually worsen the epidemic. More face-to-face, hand-to-hand, and heart-to-heart contact is a good starting prescription.Health professionals might help promote this among lay groups in theircommunities. ALCOHOL ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE The Global Burden of Disease Study ranks disability due to abuse of or de-pendence upon alcohol as second only to major depression as a top psychiatriccause of disability worldwide. There is a 14-fold difference in the rate of dis-ability (DALYs) attributed to alcohol across regions of the world, ranging froma low of 0.6 per 1,000 population in the Middle East Crescent to a high of 8.5per 1,000 in Latin America and the Caribbean. Market economies (at 5.9 per1,000) and former socialist economies (at 5.2) are the next highest for alcohol-induced disability. Worldwide, men bring 7.5 times as much alcohol disability(in DALYs) upon themselves as do women. Of course, these data must betreated with care, especially where reported rates are low. Individuals, clinics, andministries of health all tend to underestimate alcohol consumption and its se-quellae; for example, for many years the former Soviet Union did not even listcirrhosis of the liver as a possible cause of death in its mortality reports to WHO. Alcohol abuse actually accounts for a relatively small proportion of deaths di- rectly. When injuries while under the influence of alcohol, cirrhosis and cancerof the liver, alcoholic cardiomyopathy and hypertension, some stomach cancers,and other alcohol-accentuated diseases are counted, however, the total becomesa matter of public health concern. J.M. Last lists 76 medical diagnoses in 13 sys-temic categories, all of which are associated with excess alcohol consumption(Last, 1987, p. 234). By far the biggest human and economic costs of alcoholcome from physical and psychiatric morbidity, sporadic disability, and the con-flict and breakup of families. Crimes committed while drunk are responsible fora substantial fraction of persons incarcerated in prisons around the world\u2014asocietal pathology often not added to the total bill. The greatest international variability in prevalence of alcohol-caused problems is due to social and cultural forces. In regions that have the strongest religiousand legal restrictions against alcohol (Islamic nations), reported problems arefewest. In places where the culture accepts alcohol and it is readily available, the 167 BRAIN AND BEHAVIORAL DISORDERSBy far the biggest human and economic costs of alcohol come fromphysical and psychiatric morbidity,sporadic disability, and the conflict andbreakup of families.51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 167prevalence of alcohol abuse and its medical and psychosocial sequellae are very high. Even in these places, however, most people who use alcohol are able tolimit their use. There seems to be a roughly equivalent proportion of people(about 10%) in most populations who, if exposed to alcohol, become addictedto it. Community control of alcohol abuse and dependence can, therefore, usetwo strategies: reduce the number of people who can gain access to alcohol (thusputting the 10% over a smaller denominator) and educate and screen the com-munity so they can identify themselves or friends who show signs of early alco-hol misuse and can be enrolled in group treatment or community alcohol ces-sation programs, such as Alcoholics Anonymous. RISK FACTORS7 Having a parent or other close biological relative who has alcohol problems.T ransmission can be both genetic and through environmental exposure. Having biological markers that show an altered metabolism of alcohol anddecreased sensitivity to it. Childhood expression of aggressive behaviors or \"oppositional\" (rebellious)conduct disorders. Having limited coping mechanisms for dealing with emotional or interper-sonal problems, or to adjust to stresses, life changes, or family problems. Being in an environment that encourages unwise alcohol use, whether bydirect example or a lack of teaching the advantages of abstinence or strictlylimited use. Having alcohol easily available\u2014in the home, at low cost, at many stores,bars, etc. Having other neuropsychiatric co-morbidities, such as antisocial personality,difficulty in expressing feelings, or repeated depressive periods. These maylead to self-medication with alcohol. PROTECTIVE FACTORS AND INTERVENTIONS Alcohol abuse is but one way that generalized neuropsychiatric and psychosocialvulnerabilities may express themselves. Preventive efforts covered in the \"Eleven 168 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH7Adapted from Mrazek and Haggerty, 1994.51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 168Crossroads where Risk and Protective Factors Meet\" (earlier in this chapter) help reduce prevalence of alcohol abuse as well as of other community-widemental health problems. Alcohol abuse interventions include: Control of availability of alcohol. Without access, this channel of abuse dries up, although true alcohol addicts will find ways to obtain it, even brewing ordistilling it themselves. Reduced availability has its effect \"upstream,\" whereyoung people are beginning to experiment with alcohol and others are build-ing up the habit. This approach continues to be effective in many places. Positive parental example and casual teaching, such as whenever alcoholproducts are advertised, when drunkenness is observed, and providing infor-mation or direct contact with persons at the end stages of alcoholism. (Insome European countries up to 25% of hospital beds are occupied by personswith alcoholic morbidity or co-morbidity.) Effective anti-alcohol education in the schools. Many studies have shown thatmerely teaching the facts about alcohol or other drugs of abuse does notchange actual behavior of youth. However, those teachings which changenorms, values, attitudes, and beliefs about substances including alcohol, mar-ijuana (cannabis), and cigarette smoking do substantially reduce the rate ofstarting such usage over the next few years. Teaching children how to resistpeer influence to try harmful substances\u2014how, in fact, to say \"No\"\u2014also canhave significant positive effects (Hansen, 1992; Hansen and Graham, 1991). Parental and community support for those youth peer groups, such as sportsteams, that exclude alcohol from their activities and consider it \"a problem\"rather than an accepted part of their culture. Children and adolescents maintaining a continuing close relationship to par-ents and mentors (youth leaders, teachers, athletic coaches), relatives andadult friends who model safe behaviors regarding alcohol, drugs, and otherrisks. Participation in a social milieu, such as ethical and religious organizationsthat embrace a pro-social, pro-health lifestyle. The goal of these interventions not only is to prevent alcoholism, but also to prevent unintentional injuries. Alcohol raises risk of pedestrian and motor ve-hicle injuries and deaths\u2014about half of all fatalities caused by motor vehicles inthe United States involve alcohol. And alcohol is also judged to be involved inthe following estimated percentages of the following traumatic deaths (in the 169 BRAIN AND BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Haggerty, These percentages will vary by nation, depending on eco-nomics and alcohol consumption habits. Intentional injuries and homicide are often inflicted by or upon intoxicated per- sons. Alcohol reduces one's normal self-control and dims foresight as to the con-sequences of violence. A serious proportion of spouse and child abuse is com-mitted when men are intoxicated. Many men are in prison because of actscommitted under the influence of alcohol or other drugs. The alcohol habit costsmoney, reduces productivity, and increases the chances of job loss. These threeeconomic drains on a family's resources usually create conflict and poorer psy-chosocial health for all family members. All these points argue for more activecommunity involvement in the prevention of alcohol abuse and dependence. T reatment of alcohol abuse is difficult, however. For extreme cases it often must involve hospitalization or institutionalization in a restricted place where the pa-tient has no access to alcohol; such places also treat withdrawal symptoms med-ically. Group therapy should begin in the hospital and continue after discharge.The 12 step program developed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) has been themost widely used internationally. There is little controlled research as to its ef-ficacy, but many medical experts in alcoholism are now including it in treat-ment plans. Individual therapy usually fails, group therapy works better, andgroups of the AA style may be less expensive and possibly more effective thanother group approaches. 8 CONDUCT DISORDERS/DELINQUENCY Child mental health clinics treat more conduct disorders than any other diag-nosis. These behaviors start in childhood as behavior problems, often growinginto delinquency and illegal activity by the teen years. At that point they are rec-ognized as legal and police problems. Then, the criminal justice sector takescharge of the problem person. This sector usually lacks a developmental or ther-apeutic perspective and proposes to solve the problem by putting more peoplein prisons\u201490% of them men\u2014for long periods of time. In some parts of theUnited States, for example, privately built, corporately managed prisons havecome to be valued as an economic resource. Such for-profit organizations tendnot to make rehabilitation a priority. These broken lives are much like the fractured victims that emergency rescue squads pick up after an accident, say a fall down a river's steep waterfall. Ratherthan enlarging the rescue squad, it would be far wiser and more effective to ask 170 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH8This non-profit organization may be reached at Alcoholics Anonymous, World Wide Services, P .O. Box 459, Grand Central Station, New York, NY 10163.51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 170what is happening \"upstream\" to make all these people land broken at the base of the fall. What in fact is happening is that the same neuropsychiatric impair-ments that are implanted from conception through childhood\u2014and which raisethe general risk of mental deficiency, schizophrenia, major depression, and therest\u2014also raise the risk of conduct disorders. These, in turn, later promoteschool drop-out, juvenile delinquency, fighting, thieving, alcohol and drug abuse,failed marriages, births outside of marriage, and the recycling of these problemsthrough another generation. This metaphor of \"upstream prevention\" applies toall public health problems. The overall risk and protective factors for the mix of neuropsychiatric vulnera- bilities were discussed earlier, in the section entitled \"Eleven Crossroads whereRisk and Protective Factors Meet.\" What follows is a discussion of some diag-nostic signs and risk factors specific to conduct disorders. EMERGENCE OF SIGNS The onset of uncontrolled behavior may occur as early as ages 4-6 years, withanother wave coming in mid-childhood, and a final wave in adolescence. Boys start problems earlier than girls; their high-risk time is the teen years. All con-duct disorders are judged by the adult cul-ture's criteria for right and wrong. Chil-dren so judged do not share the valuesystems and behavioral controls deemednecessary for their stage of development. In general, children who develop conduct disorders experience less than normal anxiety about the possible outcomes of their aggressive or intrusive deeds, andthey do not feel guilt afterward. The lessons that punishment is supposed toteach them are quickly forgotten. This deficit has been attributed to a bluntingof autonomic nervous system responsiveness and alterations in hormonal andneurotransmitter metabolism. RISK FACTORS A temperament that is chronically irritable, difficult to manage. A child overly troubled by changes in schedule, environment, or caretakers. Presence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or approxima- tions to it. A child who is a target of parental irritation or anger, deserved or not. 171 BRAIN AND BEHAVIORAL DISORDERSThe onset of uncontrolled behavior may occur as early as ages 4-6 years, with another wave coming in mid-childhood, and a final wave inadolescence.51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 171A child that displays oppositional behavior\u2014a tendency to object to most re- quests and often to do the opposite of what others request. Delays in cognitive and language development, and reading disorders, gohand-in-hand with conduct disorder, sometimes preceding it, sometimes fol-lowing it. Parents with behavioral or mental disorders who continually fight with eachother and abuse the children or reject them. According to some longitudinalstudies, about 25% of abused or neglected children later become delinquent(Mrazek and Haggerty, 1994, pp. 171-182). Children with disabling chronic illness, injuries, or limitations. Children who show a combination of aggressiveness with peer rejection. Children living in overcrowded neighborhoods with substandard housing,poverty, broken families, crime\u2014where negative role models abound. Children subjected to harsh, erratic punishment that is inappropriate for theoffense or the child's age, or confusing to the child. PROTECTIVE FACTORS These interventions include all the positive factors, as detailed in this chapterand as implied in the \"Checklist for Ages 5-14 Years\" in Chapter 3 and the\"Checklist for Ages 15-24 Years\" in Chapter 4 of this Handbook. The follow-ing are especially important life-lines to lift children who may be starting toshow signs of conduct disorder: 1. Improving and supplementing parenting skills. This can be accomplished by teaching youth and prospective parents the basics. Another strategy mayinvolve enlisting part-time, volunteer parent surrogates to provide a respitefor children and natural parents experiencing distress (surrogates may begrandparents or community adults who love children, including childlesscouples). (Mrazek and Haggerty, 1994, have reviewed community programsto enhance child development.) 2. Enabling schools to teach healthy human-relating skills. In high-risk neighborhoods, classes may have to become smaller and social workers,school nurses, or counselors may need to be added. (See also the section onthe \"Good Behavior Game,\" presented earlier in this chapter.) 3. Teaching skills and preventing the harmful use of idle hours through after-school programs for children of working parents. These are oppor- 172 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 172tunities to teach non-academic skills, including sports and vocational abili- ties. These skills are another protective resource, because they teach childrenhow to cooperate with others, to increase their self-efficacy and self-esteem,and to prepare for leadership roles. 4. Developing and maintaining positive relationships between children and youths and their parents, uncles, aunts, grandparents, older siblings,neighbors, schoolteachers, athletic coaches, and youth group leaders.Adults will need to have patience, and perhaps firmness, to maintain theserelationships. Scientific evidence now shows that having a special adult closeto the life of a child reduces the risk of delinquency; a position corroboratedby many adult model citizens who attribute their healthy lives to a specialperson who turned them away from a troubled adolescence. Social and behavioral therapies to slow and even to halt the development of delinquent behavior have become sufficiently advanced to be tested in random-ized controlled clinical trials. The group treatments are variously based on sociallearning, cognitive conditioning, and/or family therapy models. Because of theoverwhelming prevalence of conduct disorder, delinquency, and their precur-sors, these therapies are almost always given to groups. S. R. Woolfenden and colleagues (2002) in New Zealand qualitatively reviewed eight high-quality controlled trials involving 749 youths ages 10-14 years, all of whom already showed antisocial conduct disorders. A variety of family andparenting interventions reduced chances of re-arrest by 34% on average, andsignificantly reduced the time spent in correctional institutions, as compared tosimilar untreated youths. The Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group (1999) reports a major con- trolled study in which 378 classrooms of students were randomized to usual teach-ing versus the \"fast track\" conduct disorder prevention curriculum. The lattercomprises 57 lessons focusing on self-control, emotional awareness, peer relations,and problem solving. The \"fast track\" curriculum was associated prospectivelywith reduced hyperactive, disruptive behavior and improved classroom atmos-phere. The research team argues for greater use of school-based programs for re-ducing behavioral problems. This position also is supported by Rones and Hoag-wood (2000) in their extensive review of school-based mental health services. These programs may not apply in the same way in different social and cultural environments. They are reviewed here to alert public health, mental health, andschool health professionals to the great potential social value of such preventionefforts. The extensive reference lists contained in each cited report can provideblueprints and building blocks for local professionals worldwide. 9 173 BRAIN AND BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS9Key references include Kendall (ed.), 1991, chapters by Feindler and Lochman, and Hersen et al.

Health promoters also should seek to help averagefolks become better, to develop more of their positive potentials. Once again,the discussion returns to the \"population approach,\" discussed in Chapter 2,which argues that by raising the capabilities and functions of the entire com-munity, one age cohort at a time, the number and proportion of the populationfunctioning below the threshold of disorder can be decreased\u2014and the numberof high achievers can be increased. Might such a program help create a community where everyone is above aver- age? Statisticians may vehemently shout \"No!\" If we reshape this aspiration,however, and ask whether it is possible to have communities where the vast ma-jority of persons function above the average (of past generations), the resound-ing chorus may well be, \"Yes!\" Positive behavioral and mental health have been variously defined. Sigmund Freud's assertion that good mental health is the ability to love and to work is agood starting place. More specifically, persons or groups with positive behav-ioral and mental health share certain qualities, such as are described in the fol-lowing sections. AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL10 Within the Self Self-acceptance. Self-accepting persons feel comfortable with themselves\u2014not necessarily always satisfied, and certainly not prideful or uncritical, but accept-ing of their value to those around them. Basically, they believe they're OK. Self-esteem. Persons with self-esteem feel that their lives are of value, that they are worthy of being respected and loved by themselves and by others. Realistic perceptions. People with realistic perceptions have a reasonably accu- rate understanding of the world around them and of their own abilities and lim-itations. Psychiatrists refer to this as \"good reality testing.\" 174 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH10The following points have been abridged and modified from materials by the National Men- tal Health Association (U.S.A.).51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 174Self-efficacy. Persons with this quality have the skills to take care of the usual tasks of life and the ability to deal with new problems. They have a realisticamount of faith in their own abilities and planning. Emotional self-management. This quality enables people not only to deal with everyday tasks and problems, but also with the psychological processes insidethem, such as strong emotions, fears, uncertainty, and interpersonal conflicts.These people do not get swept away by their own strong feelings or those of oth-ers. They can rise above disappointments. In Relationships with Others Persons endowed with superior mental and behavioral health are able to main-tain ongoing relationships that are satisfying to all involved. They are able todevelop trust in others and, in turn, to earn others' trust and respect. They do not cheat or hurt others and refuse to accept such behaviors from oth- ers. They also are able to love and care deeply for those close to them, whetherfamily or friends, and put these persons' well-being above their own. Living Productively Life's daily responsibilities differ greatly throughout the life cycle. Extreme de-pendency is the norm for infants and the seriously disabled, while responsibil-ity, fulfillment of roles, and social produc-tivity is expected of those functioning withgreater capability. Sometimes, however, cir-cumstances and demand must be modifiedto fit personal limitations. Conversely, edu-cation, job training, preparation for parent-ing, and improving self-efficacy are all intended to increase personal capabilitiesto cope, overcome negative circumstances if necessary, and fulfill life's demands. Persons with positive health accept and fulfill appropriate responsibilities, often achieving beyond them. They think and plan realistically, unburdened by unduefears or unrealistic expectations. These persons are open to new experiences andchallenges and work to resolve problems for the betterment of those aroundthem and of their communities. These same qualities that go into an individual's positive mental health can eas- ily be extrapolated to the family and to the community at large. In fact, they canbe expanded to apply to more complex units such as health institutions or evennational organizations. The same basic principles remain easily recognizable. 175 BRAIN AND BEHAVIORAL DISORDERSHealth promoters should not just try to rescue persons already sufferingfrom a disorder, they also should helpaverage folks become better.51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 175The following two sections summarize how these principles can be applied to the family and the community. AT THE FAMILY LEVEL Self-acceptance, Self-esteem, Realism, Efficacy Does the family feel accepting about all its members? About itself as a family? Can it work on those issues about which it is dissatisfied? Does it look forwardto its own future as a caring group? Does it generate pleasure and mutual sup-port for all its members most of the time? Continuity of Satisfying, Trusting, and Caring Relationships Does the family and its members feel comfortable relating with others outside the family\u2014with neighbors, people at their schools, shops, workplaces? Arethere close family friends that link it to the rest of the community? Are therecommunity conflicts that make the family dislike or hate other families orgroups, or fear those whom they suspect may hate them? Coping with Life Responsibly and Productively Can the family take care of itself and the needs of its members? Do adults providefood, shelter, support, and care for dependent members? Do adults provide ahealthy social-emotional environment? Do they show and teach children to followhealthy life habits? Do they nurture children's talents? Do they help them mature?Do they help them to respect and help others? Does the family plan ahead? Doesit deal with its problems promptly, taking into consideration everyone's needs? AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL Self-acceptance, Self-esteem, Effectiveness Does the community believe that it and its purposes are valuable? Does it accept its members? Does it acknowledge its members' full diversity, accepting their di-verse needs, qualities, and gifts? Do the community's members work cohesively?Is the community realistic in its perceptions of itself and its environment? Relations with Other Groups Does the community or organization maintain constructive, mutually beneficialrelations with individuals and organizations outside itself? Does it promote pos-itive ethical values and respect for others? 176 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 176Responsible Productivity Is the community responsible, productive, and flexible? Does it plan ahead for the good of all? Can it manage its collective needs? In evaluating a community's health, a sanitary engineer will check drinking water quality, sewage and waste disposal systems, and air pollution controls. Apublic health planner might count the number of health providers and healthfacilities in the community. Now healthpromoters, too, can systematically evaluatefamily and community behavioral health.Starting from the three criteria discussedabove, and selecting specific indicators tomeasure each, they will be able to evaluatefar more than mental health. The next leap forward in improving world health depends on teaching, en- abling, and practicing those behaviors that prevent disease and advance health.These behaviors, the science that supports them, and the motivations that en-ergize them are presented in this Handbook, as well as in many other sources.That is why this chapter on behavioral and mental health is placed first in thispart of the Handbook. Taking care of one's lungs, liver, limbs, and heart mustbegin with behavioral and mental health, and so must taking care of one's fam-ily and community. 177 BRAIN AND BEHAVIORAL DISORDERSWhere behavioral and mental health are high, physical health also is likelyto be good, and social well-being will flourish.51331_p161_198_r1 4/7/03 3:17 PM Page 1778. Diseases of the Heart and Blood Vessels CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS Collectively, cardiovascular disorders are the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for more than 14 million fatalities each year (Murray and Lopez,1996). The most common heart diseases emerge later in life, often disablingpeople for some years before killing them. These disorders are the fourth lead-ing contributor to worldwide loss of healthy life years (DALYs) over the entirelife span, following infections and parasitic diseases, injuries, and neuropsychi-atric disorders. From ages 45 to 59 years in both women and men, however,cardiovascular disorders rank first as the cause of lost DALYs. After age 60,these disorders are responsible for twice to three times the amount of losthealthy years as the next ranking major pathology. Hence, the reduction of car-diovascular disorders yields a three-point advantage: less disease, less disability,less premature death. Cardiovascular disorders are very costly to treat and place a major burden on the health care system. They are far less costly to prevent, however, and fortu-nately some nations have made remarkable strides in reducing some forms ofcardiovascular disorders. While both developing and developed nations experience high mortality and disability due to diseases of the heart and blood vessels, the underlying natureof the diseases differs in each group. Canada, the United States, and Scandina-vian and Western European nations have long suffered primarily from athero-sclerosis, which results in such diseases as ischemic heart disease or coronaryheart disease (heart attack), and cerebrovascular infarction (stroke). Most sud-den cardiac deaths and true angina pectoris cases have the same atheroscleroticorigins. This epidemic peaked in the 1960s and 1970s in Western countries.Since then, both the incidence and mortality from ischemic heart disease (coro-nary heart disease) have been declining by about 2% to 3% per year. The causesof this dramatic, continuous reduction are not fully understood, but intensiverisk reduction programs and the populations' positive responses have played amajor role in substantially reducing the major risk factors. Meanwhile, in Eastern Europe, economically transitional countries in the Mid- dle and Far East, and in Central and South America, the incidence and mor-tality of ischemic heart disease are rising each year. In these regions, populations 179 DISEASES OF THE HEART AND BLOOD VESSELS51331_p199_220_r1 4/7/03 3:18 PM Page 179are increasing their cigarette smoking, eating more fatty foods, getting less phys- ical exercise, and experiencing more competition and stress that increase bloodpressure and serum cholesterol levels. Unfortunately, these nations have manyserious epidemics to confront all at once, including controlling infectious dis-eases and the inflammatory and parasitic diseases remaining from earlier in theireconomic development. All epidemics are created by the culture in which theyappear. With cultures now changing more rapidly than ever, health experts arechallenged both to vanquish old epidemics and forestall or weaken new ones. There is no reason why developing and transitional countries must repeat the painful history that more industrialized countries are now leaving behind. It re-quires only limited resources to begin primary prevention\u2014by informing thepublic about the risk behaviors and risk factors for ischemic heart disease andrelated diseases\u2014to chart a different, healthier route for the future. (Also see the section \"Tobacco Use\" in Chapter 13.) For developing countries, the major cardiovascular killers today are inflamma- tory heart diseases, cardiomyopathies, and pulmonary heart disease (cor pul-monale). Hypertension has a high prevalence in the tropics, and, in the absenceof effective control, develops into hypertensive heart disease, variously leadingto congestive heart failure, stroke, pulmonary heart disease, or kidney failure.Distinguishing between \"developed\" and \"developing\" nations is clear at the ex-tremes of the range, but what about countries in the middle? The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) attributes most of the non- atherosclerotic cardiovascular deaths to ICD entries 415-429\u2014diseases of pul-monary circulation and other forms of heart disease (including pericarditis,endocarditis, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, dysrhythmias, and heart failure dueto edema; this excludes rheumatic heart disease, cardiac valve diseases,sequellae of hypertensive heart disease, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis,cerebrovascular disease, and \"other and unspecified\"). Table 8.1 shows the percentages of all cardiovascular deaths that have been at- tributed to ischemic heart disease and atherosclerosis (combined) in contrast todiseases of pulmonary circulation and other forms of heart diseases for 13 coun-tries in the Americas. Caution must be utilized in interpreting the data, becausevarious countries use different diagnostic criteria and have different levels of re-liability. For countries in other areas of the world, rough comparisons can bemade to tabulated countries of similar climate and economic development,until such time as local data are obtained. The first surprise to North American and Western European health profession- als is the size of the problem of non-atherosclerotic heart diseases. In 8 of the 13countries in the table, deaths due to pulmonary heart disease and inflammatory 180 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p199_220_r1 4/7/03 3:18 PM Page 180heart disease exceed 20% of total cardiovascular deaths; in three countries, the values exceed the ischemic heart disease total. Another notable finding is that thestrength of the negative correlation betweenthe rankings of the percentages goes wellbeyond the mathematical expectation. Thischapter will first examine the forms of car-diovascular disease still awaiting preventionin less developed areas. INFLAMMATORY HEART DISEASES Congestive (or dilated) cardiomyopathy and restrictive cardiomyopathy (alsocalled endomyocardial fibrosis) are rampant Sub-Saharan Africa, where au-topsy series attribute 25% to 40% of all cardiac deaths to these conditions.Congestive cardiomyopathy occurs in many parts of the world, with concentra- 181 DISEASES OF THE HEART AND BLOOD VESSELSTABLE 8.1.

Congestive cardiomyopathy often impairs the pumping ac- tion of both sides of the heart, and leads to heart failure. Some experts classifythis disease as an autoimmune disorder set up by repeated viral infections (forexample, from echo and Cocksackie), rheumatic fever, or toxoplasmosis. It canalso result from thiamin deficiency or alcoholism. When these agents or otherchronic bacterial or parasitic infections set up a chronic inflammation of themyocardium, pericardium, or endocardium, the autoimmune battle is engaged,and cardiomyopathies often emerge. Epidemiologic risk factors include living in tropical or poor countries or in poor conditions in affluent countries, inadequacy of environmental control of theseinfections and their vectors, lack of medical care, and lack of balanced nutrition.The road to prevention lies in environmental and behavioral changes that pre-vent and treat these infections, and in provision of healthy foods that will raisehost resistance. Congestive cardiomyopathy is no stranger in tropical America, but there a major cause is Chagas' disease (American trypanosomiasis). Chagas' disease is heavilyendemic in Venezuela and Brazil, with lesser prevalence from the southernUnited States to the South America's Southern Cone. Other congestive car-diomyopathies operate there, too, through the final common path of myocardi-tis or chronic inflammations of other heart tissues. Chagas' disease, now foundonly in the Western Hemisphere, is spread by a crawling insect, a triatomid (acone-nosed bug), which itself is infected by a parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi . When the triatomid bites a human, seeking a blood meal, the bug's feces containing aform of the trypanosome pass through breaks in the skin, enter the bloodstream,and multiply. T rypanosomes mainly seek out the heart, followed by the gas-trointestinal tract. The cardiac inflammation caused by the parasite can developinto cardiomyopathy and/or other conditions elsewhere in the body. 182 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHPRIMARY PREVENTION OF CHAGAS' DISEASE making homes \"bug tight,\" by filling holes and cracks and by setting up screening; applying residual insecticides in all buildings or shelters where humans or animals live; establishing community programs to help residents cover rough inside walls (especially of thatch, mud, or rough wood) and crevices in walls and floors with smooth inorganicplaster\u2014this seals off the living and hiding places of triatomids; cleaning beds and furniture that may have plant coverings or stuffing (such as mat- tresses) and carefully using residual insecticides on bedding surfaces that do not touchpeople for further protection; and using fine mesh bed nets to prevent triatomid attacks while in bed. T reatment measures are currently based on two types of antibiotic drugs that quickly lead to remission of symptoms, including fever and inflammation. Theantibiotics halt the acute disease episode, but do not lessen the damage alreadydone by the chronic disease (Last, 1986; Cheng, 1986, Chapter 52).51331_p199_220_r1 4/7/03 3:18 PM Page 182RHEUMATIC HEART DISEASE This disease also is of infectious origin: it begins with repeated infections with Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (strep throat, for example), which may befollowed by an autoimmune process in one to five weeks\u2014resulting in acuterheumatic fever. Usually occurring in school-aged children, acute rheumaticfever may affect the heart, central nervous system, kidneys, and/or joints. Oncechildren have had one attack of acute rheumatic fever, they appear to be moresusceptible to recurrent streptococcal infections and acute rheumatic fever reac-tions. Nearly half of acute rheumatic fever cases incur a cardiac inflammation,usually without immediate symptoms. Progression of the rheumatic processoften causes stenosis inflammations also may lead to cardiomyopathy. Rheumatic heart disease is associated with poverty in every climate. Over- crowding, poor housing, and inadequate sanitation encourage the spread ofstreptococcal infections. The lack of medical care associated with poverty re-duces the chances that infections will be treated either acutely or by a long-termregimen of prophylactic penicillin in children with acute rheumatic feverepisodes. Because ethnic and racial minority groups are often much poorer thanthe rest of a community, they also have higher acute rheumatic fever and rheu-matic heart disease rates. Rates of rheumatic heart disease have been declining in Westernized nations since about 1890. In the Region of the Americas, mortality data from 20 na-tions show that the percentage of all deaths due to rheumatic heart diseaseranges from 0.1% to 1.3% in men and 0.3% to 2.4% in women. This is one ofthe few diseases that disables and kills more women than men. In the Americas,the countries with the highest percentages of rheumatic heart disease mortalityare Belize, Chile, and Mexico for men, and Belize, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador,Mexico, and Panama for women (PAHO, 1995, 1989-1990 data). Developingnations in the Eastern Hemisphere (especially if tropical) also experience muchrheumatic heart disease. PULMONARY HEART DISEASE Pulmonary heart disease\u2014often referred to as cor pulmonale\u2014affects the rightside of the heart and the vessels carrying blood to and from the lungs; it can fol-low any of 37 known causes (Cheng, 1986, Chapter 54). This disease oftenstarts with pulmonary hypertension\u2014high blood pressure from the right side ofthe heart, through the pulmonary arteries, the lungs, and then back to the heart.This puts a load on the right ventricle to keep pumping blood through the lungsagainst a greater pressure than the heart is prepared to handle. This results in hy-pertrophy of the heart muscle, thickening of blood vessel walls, and poorer ex- 183 DISEASES OF THE HEART AND BLOOD VESSELS51331_p199_220_r1 4/7/03 3:18 PM Page 183change of carbon dioxide for fresh oxygen. In turn, this demands that the heart pump harder to get adequate oxygen, thus worsening the pathology. Pulmonary heart disease also can originate in the lungs from chronic obstruc- tive pulmonary disease or emphysema. In post-industrial populations, cigarettesmoking is the most frequent cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Industrial exposures also are important instigators and promoters of this disease,including exposure to asbestos, coal dust, dusts from mining, cotton fiber dust,beryllium, toxic gases and vapors, carbon monoxide, smoke, and radiation. Dis-eases causing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease include tuberculosis, lunginfections, lupus erythematosis, sickle cell disease, pulmonary granulomas, throm-boses, emboli, and Chagas' disease. Populations in developing and transitional nations experience excessive pul- monary heart disease mortality, as do populations where hypertension is en-demic. In the 1990s pulmonary heart disease was increasing in the formerSoviet Union, Japan, and, especially, in some parts of China. In warm-climate countries where schistosomiasis is endemic, this parasite is a major cause of pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary heart disease. Thechance of serious cardiopulmonary disease is small among persons having schis-tosomiasis, only about 5%. Nevertheless, the estimated 200 million infectedpersons in the world can be expected to generate up to 10 million cases of pul-monary hypertension and, in time, pulmonary heart disease. Schistosomiasis 184 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHPREVENTION OF RHEUMATIC HEART DISEASE Primary Prevention Improving standards of living is clearly the best approach to primary prevention of acuterheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease\u2014this both reduces the spread of infectionsand builds host resistance to them. The target group is school-aged children, because,although having similar exposures to streptococci, infants and adults rarely go on toexperience acute rheumatic fever. In high prevalence areas, mass screening of schoolchildren with throat cultures for streptococci has been cost effective, when followed by prompt antibiotic treatment ofthose who test positive. In a program in Wyoming (U.S.A.) in the late 1960s, this effortcost about US$ 1 per pupil per year. Not only were individual children helped with treat-ment, but the prevalence of streptococcal carriers also was reduced by 50% to 75%, thusreducing infectious transmission. Such programs have greatest cost-benefit where theprevalence of acute rheumatic fever is highest. Because these areas also are usually thepoorest, financing and program delivery usually come from outside the community. Secondary Prevention This is best accomplished by providing long-term prophylactic penicillin treatment toprevent recurrent strep infection and acute rheumatic fever in children and youths with a history of repeated acute rheumatic fever episodes. Treatment should prevent seriouscardiac valve damage, but it is more expensive.51331_p199_220_r1 4/7/03 3:18 PM Page 184causes other pathologies in the liver, gastrointestinal tract, and bladder, so car- diovascular impairment is just one more reason to eradicate it. Eradication mustbe done on a community-wide basis. In some areas, the prime cause of pulmonary heart disease is chronic pulmonary hypertension; in others, the prime cause is chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-ease. Preventive programs may attack either or both these causes, depending onthe presence of local risk factors and local feasibility of programs. Risk Factors Respiratory. Exposure to primary or second-hand cigarette smoke; exposure to particulate air pollutants (e.g., dusts, quarrying and mining particulates, beryl-lium); exposure to caustic chemical air pollution (e.g., carbon monoxide, organo-phosphates in pesticides, nitrates, smoke, some gases); repeated chest radiation;asthma; fibrosis in lungs; or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Cardiovascular. Pulmonary hypertension; thromboses or emboli in the lungs; sickle cell disease; diseases of blood vessels in the pulmonary circulation. Parasitic Infections. Schistosomiasis; chronic bronchitis; tuberculosis; Chagas' disease; other chronic infections or parasitic damage or lungalveoli. Other Diseases. Lupus erythematosis; cystic disease; granulomas or fibrosis in the lungs. Protective Factors Never starting tobacco smoking and stopping once started; Protecting families and workers from second-hand smoke; The community or government insisting on protecting workers in dusty,smoky workplaces (e.g., by distributing filter breathing masks, controllingdust by electrostatic precipitation or by water sprays); Making clean air a community priority (just like clean water to drink); Promptly controlling infections and parasitic diseases affecting the lungs,especially tuberculosis; Eliminating Chagas' disease from homes; 185 DISEASES OF THE HEART AND BLOOD VESSELS51331_p199_220_r1 4/7/03 3:18 PM Page 185Preventing and/or treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Medically monitoring and treating sickle cell disease, lupus, cystic disease of lungs to postpone development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease andpulmonary heart disease; Screening for and controlling pulmonary hypertension with periodic follow-up. NUTRITIONAL HEART DISEASES Programs to reverse the epidemic of ischemic (coronary) heart disease in NorthAmerica and Western Europe have made a strong case that ischemic heart dis-ease is, in large part, a nutritional disease\u2014specifically, an overconsumption ofsaturated fats, salt, and excess calories, leading to overweight. Excess caloriesmeans that fats are stored, not metabolized. Saturated fats, along with dietary cholesterol, recycle through the digestive sys-tem, blood vessels, liver, intestine and back tothe bloodstream, thus having the opportunityto paint a thin layer of fatty streak (and lateratherosclerotic plaque) on arterial walls severaltimes over. Finally, salt raises blood pressure,as does obesity. Hence, most of the ischemicheart disease risk factors are clearly present inthis dietary pattern. Alcohol consumption also can contribute to heart diseases in several ways. Especially when consumption exceeds one or two alcoholic drinks per day, itadds \"empty calories,\" leading to a bulging abdomen. Furthermore, it hurtsliver function, thus raising low-density (harmful) lipids. Over time it raisesblood pressure. In excess, it causes alcoholic cardiomyopathy. Simply put, over-nutrition and wrong nutrition raise major risk factors for ischemic heartdisease. Meanwhile, on the other side of the globe, health authorities confront those car- diovascular diseases due to undernutrition. They are becoming less prevalent,but warrant public attention until they disappear. There are two major types:protein energy malnutrition and thiamin deficiency. Protein-energy malnutrition sometimes follows crop failures or famine. Far more frequently, however, it follows breakdowns in commerce, the fall of govern-ments, war, or the forced movement of people from their homes and lands. Thefinal common result of all these disruptions is semi- or total starvation of vastgroups of people. The common solution of such problems is the provision ofenough foods to reverse, as much as possible, the diseases of starvation. 186 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHProtein-energy malnutrition sometimes follows crop failures or famine. Far more frequently, however, it follows breakdowns in commerce, the fall of governments, war, or the forced movement of people from their homes and lands.51331_p199_220_r1 4/7/03 3:18 PM Page 186Protein-energy malnutrition continues to be endemic in areas of Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, but it also should be suspected in pockets of deeppoverty anywhere in the world. Health authorities who assume it cannot hap-pen in their countries, usually have not screened susceptible subgroups. Ac-cording to Charithiraphan (Cheng, 1986, Chapter 50), \". . . whenever it isscreened for, its prevalence is higher than expected.\" The longer this deficiencygoes uncorrected, the more severe and chronic cardiac damage becomes. Inmost circumstances, the protein deficiency is worse than calorie deficiency;hence, protein supplementation (including vegetable sources) might requirehigher priority. (Also see the section on \"Malnutrition\" in Chapter 9.) Thiamin deficiency can strike malnourished infants and children acutely with arange of severe symptoms, including beri beri heart disease. The acute stage ofthis disease can be fatal in the very young, but will be quickly reversed by the ad-ministration of thiamin, intravenously if urgent, or by mouth for longer follow-up care. Thiamin deficiency often also manifests in abnormal neurological signs.Where beri beri has become chronic, permanent defects in the heart will remain. In infants, children, and adults, beri beri and its cardiac components can result either from inadequate consumption of thiamin-containing protein foods, orfrom acute physical stresses that deplete body stores of amino acids. Strenuousexertion, fever, parasitic loads, and other illnesses can precipitate this deficiency.Certain raw fermented fish eaten in Southeast Asia can destroy thiamin storedin the body. Thiamin-deficiency heart disease also occurs in Western nations, but not among adequately nourished people. In these countries it is often found as a result ofchronic alcoholism. Again, depletion of the body's storage of amino acids byacute diseases, malabsorption syndromes, or heavy labor can precipitate beriberi with its cardiac sequellae. In adults beri beri progresses more slowly than inchildren and is often accompanied by neuropathies. In industrialized nations another subgroup at risk of nutritional heart diseases are young women who put themselves on starvation diets, by bingeing andpurging or by extreme weight loss. This should be kept in mind by health pro-fessionals working with young women. HYPERTENSION AND HYPERTENSIVE HEART DISEASE Clinicians apply the term \"hypertension\" when they find that a person's bloodpressure remains higher than an arbitrary critical value, even while that personsits quietly. That observation needs to be found consistently on several occasionsweeks apart to confirm the diagnosis. Hypertension\u2014chronic high blood pres-sure\u2014is undesirable because: 187 DISEASES OF THE HEART AND BLOOD VESSELS51331_p199_220_r1 4/7/03 3:18 PM Page 187it raises the risk of heart attack (ischemic heart disease); it raises the risk of stroke (cerebrovascular disease); over time, it causes structural changes in the heart (the muscles of the left ventricle grow bigger, affecting pumping ability), thus causing hypertensiveheart disease; and the observed blood pressure elevation may be the start of a larger increase,which would accelerate the problems in all of the above, as well as create arisk for damage to the kidneys. Everyone's blood pressure changes minute to minute. It is higher when we work hard physically or mentally, and when we are angry or frightened. It is lowerwhen we are resting, and lowest of all when we are deeply asleep. A study ofmore than 400 air traffic controllers measured blood pressure every 20 minutesfor 5 consecutive hours. All readings were made while the air traffic controllerwas seated; no measures were taken during physical exertion. The average man'srange (high minus low) of systolic blood pressure under these controlled con-ditions was 35 mmHg (+/- 12); the average diastolic range was 27 mmHg (+/- 8). Thus, about one-sixth of these healthy men had a fluctuation of 49mmHg in systolic blood pressure, or 35 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure whileseated in the five hour period (Rose, Jenkins, and Hurst, 1978). Such profound rises and falls in blood pressures are the ways healthy people's bodies adjust to daily activities. The problem of hypertension arises when thebody loses the ability to drop pressure to a low healthy baseline. Forces deter-mining blood pressure level at any time include: how much fluid volume is in the system of blood vessels; how much blood the heart pushes out at any one beat; how rapidly the heart beats; how much the peripheral arteries and arterioles have contracted to squeezesmaller the space the blood has available to it; how much elasticity (\"compliance\") the major arteries have that spreads outthe peaks of cardiac output pressure, so that more distal vessels incur lower,spread-out peaks and less deep drops in pressure between heart contractions. The risk factors for hypertension, as well as the methods for treating it, involve these five mechanisms. 188 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p199_220_r1 4/7/03 3:18 PM Page 188Risk Factors Family Aggregation. Hypertension runs in families, primarily due to genetics and secondarily to shared lifestyle. Age. Blood pressure tends to rise with age in industrialized societies. Diastolic blood pressure rises in populations until about age 55 years, then levels off.Average systolic blood pressure rises to the end of the lifespan. The amount ofincrease with age is often very small in simple agrarian cultures, but most peo-ple have a marked increase in blood pres-sure if they move from a rural place to anurban one, with the stress of rapid mod-ernization of daily life that it brings. Ac-cording to cross-sectional studies, bloodpressure rises more steeply in urban set-tings, but longitudinal studies of the samepersons over a decade or more show that a sizeable minority (about 40% in one 14-year study) do not have a rising slope of annually measured blood pres-sure. The remaining people have large enough increases to make the groupaverages rise. Overweight. Being too heavy for one's skeletal size raises blood pressure, and obesity does so even more dramatically. Each pound of fat is filled with miles ofcapillaries that require pressure for blood to move through. The more fat, theharder the heart must work. Of course, many forces affect blood pressure, anddepending on these other forces, some \"skinny\" people may have high bloodpressure and some obese people may have normal blood pressure. But as withmany other generalizations in the risk factor literature, the averages for groupsof people more than overcome the individual exceptions. Preventive medicineprograms are generally addressed to large groups. Sodium in the Diet. Some people's blood pressure level is sensitive to sodium. In general, populations with high salt intake have higher blood pressures. Suchpeople can lower their blood pressures without medications, simply by cuttingout naturally salty foods, and not adding salt or monosodium glutamate tobland foods. Instead, herbal spices can be used to enhance flavor. Sodium holdswater within the blood vessels, increasing their fluid volume\u2014thereby raisingblood pressure. Physicians sometimes prescribe diuretics to treat hypertension.They stimulate the kidneys to excrete water and sodium more quickly, thus re-ducing fluid volume. Alcohol Consumption. Regularly drinking more than two alcoholic drinks each day raises blood pressure chronically in groups, and some individuals maybe adversely influenced by less alcohol than this. This is one of many reasons tominimize alcohol consumption. 189 DISEASES OF THE HEART AND BLOOD VESSELSBeing too heavy for one's skeletal size raises blood pressure, and obesity doesso even more dramatically. The morefat, the harder the heart must work.51331_p199_220_r1 4/7/03 3:18 PM Page 189Other Diseases. Some acute and chronic diseases raise blood pressure to dan- gerous levels. This is called secondary hypertension. Obtain a medical diagnosisand treatment for any such diseases. Some Environmental Stressors. Both animal and human research has shown that some environmental stressors can raise blood pressure not only acutely, butalso chronically. Ostfeld and Shekelle identified five conditions that increase thechances that long-sustained psychosocial stress is most likely to elevate bloodpressure chronically: an uncertain life situation; lack of experience to learn which behavioral response will solve a given problem; the possibility of serious harm; the fact that fight or flight are unlikely to help; and the need for sustained mental vigilance. Air traffic controllers experience four of the five stressors detailed above\u2014all except lack of experience. Air traffic controllers have a very high incidence ofhypertension (Stamler (ed.), 1967). 1 Temperament. Studies from several industrialized areas suggest that people ex- periencing stressful circumstances who complain, feel upset, and show theiremotions are lesslikely to develop sustained high blood pressure. They may, however, have acute rises in blood pressure only while they express their feelings.Those who deny that they face any problems, who show below average anxiety,and don't complain about tough circumstances tend to have higher risk of grad-ually raising the baseline of their resting blood pressure. Social or Economic Disadvantage. People who have low education, low in- come, or who are subject to racism or discrimination run clearly higher bloodpressures as a group. Numerous studies of neighborhoods, patient groups, andfactory workers in several nations have supported this finding. People who are discriminated against or who are poor face an uncertain life sit- uation; lack enough experience to solve their current problems; are threatenedwith the possibility of serious harm; don't have the option of escaping or fight-ing their circumstances; and must be constantly and continually vigilant. Inshort, all five of the Ostfeld and Shekelle criteria are fulfilled. 190 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH1This work has withstood 30 years of subsequent research.51331_p199_220_r1 4/7/03 3:18 PM Page 190Protective Factors Receive treatment. Seek treatment for any disease or condition that may be causing high blood pressure. Maintain a normal weight for height and body frame. If overweight, reduce caloric intake and increase moderate exercise\u2014there is a direct correlation be-tween pounds of body fat lostand reduction of resting blood pressure. Reduce sodium intake. The cheapest way to determine whether people are sodium-sensitive is to make a sharp reduction in sodium intake and see whetherblood pressure goes down. Simply reducing salt from 10 times the body's needsto 7 times may not help much; one may have to decrease perhaps to 3 or 4 timesthe daily requirement. Be careful to replenish the body's need for potassium andcalcium. Also be cautious when sweating profusely in hot weather. Reduce or stop drinking alcohol.Increase the level of daily physical activity. Engaging in walking or sports will lower most people's blood pressure over time. Try to avoid the environmental stressors listed under \"Risk Factors.\" This may be approached either by changing circumstances, changing the way youperceive and think about them, or discharging tension by finding ways to ex-press to friends how you really feel. Practice relaxation exercises daily. It has been established for a century that the cen-tral and autonomic nervous systems are themain regulators of blood pressure, so thelast three risk factors listed above shouldcome as no surprise. Various relaxation ex-ercises and yogic practices have been shownto lower blood pressure both acutely andchronically, modestly on average for groups,but more effectively in some individuals.Studies have shown that relaxation prac-tices in some persons taking anti-hyperten-sive medication, allow the drug dosage tobe reduced without their blood pressure ris-ing. More attention should be paid to natural, psycho-neural means of loweringblood pressure in groups of moderate hypertensives who lack the traditional bi-ologic risk factors. 191 DISEASES OF THE HEART AND BLOOD VESSELSIn places where hypertension (and stroke) are epidemic and thepopulation very large\u2014such asNorthern China, with hundreds ofmillions of people\u2014individual or family treatment with drugs is futilefor solving the public health problem.Population-wide programs to lowerthe modifiable risk factors and increaseprotective factors, however, shouldmake a impact over time.51331_p199_220_r1 4/7/03 3:18 PM Page 191Use physician-prescribed medication to lower blood pressure. Advise the physician if you are also using any of the protective factors above. There are nowmany anti-hypertensive drugs available with different modes of action and atdifferent prices. ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE Ischemic heart disease, also known as coronary artery or coronary heart dis- ease\u2014and by the general public as \"heart attack\"\u2014has been the leading causeof cardiovascular mortality for most of the 20th century in Western and North-ern Europe and in Canada and the United States. In the 21st century it isexpected to become the top cause of cardiac death in the rest of the world.Ischemic heart disease, although not an infectious disease, spreads like an epi-demic, propelled by cultural change. Atherosclerosis is the main underlying pathological process leading to ischemic heart disease, including myocardial infarction (heart attack), sudden hemorrhage), and Atherosclerosis consists of fat deposits along susceptiblesurfaces of arteries; the fat forms plaques that enlarge and harden, narrowing theartery channel. When this occurs in coronary arteries, the now smaller passagescan get blocked by little blood clots (thrombi) or other debris in the bloodstream(emboli), thus shutting off blood flow to parts of the heart (ischemia). Lack of oxygen causes the severe chest pain of a \"heart attack\" (acute myocar- dial infarction), myocardial (heart muscle) cells die, and if the heart can nolonger deliver enough blood, the patient dies, too. About 25% of first attacksare quickly fatal. The remaining stricken patients survive\u2014the time of survivalrelates to the amount and placement of the dead heart muscle, and to the speed,adequacy, and continuity of medical care received. The science of acute care andrehabilitation after myocardial infarction has advanced greatly, and most pa-tients return to normal functioning. The rise (starting about 1930) and fall (starting around 1970) of the ischemic heart disease epidemic in industrialized nations holds forth the possibility thatother nations can abort this epidemic rising within their borders, and start theirdecline even now by reducing the risk factors for atherosclerosis. They shouldbegin this primary prevention now, before the epidemic peaks. Risk Factors Sedentary lifestyle. In industrialized countries lack of physical exercise has con- tributed to more ischemic heart disease deaths than any other single risk factor. 192 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p199_220_r1 4/7/03 3:18 PM Page 192That is because more people are doing more sitting than are engaging in any other risk behavior. As farm and factory work becomes more automated, societyhas benefited from extraordinary gains in productivity. Most people, however,did not replace the physical work they used to do\u2014which exercised their heart,lungs, and limbs all day\u2014with even a daily hour of challenging activity. Toomany of us are taking \"the chair lift\" to the peak of cardiac risk, and the down-fall afterwards is rapid, indeed. Sedentary life is a risk factor at every age. High blood pressure. The pounding of high blood pressure into arterial walls, especially head-on at curves of the arteries, appears to damage their inner lin-ings (intima) and build up atherosclerosis. The high pressure also raises risk ofvessels tearing (hemorrhage) or ballooningoutward (aneurysm). High blood pressureraises the risk for many disorders. This toois a risk factor at every age. Cigarette smoking. In this we have a \"quadruple threat\" aggressor. Cigarette smoking delivers nicotine to the bloodstream, irritating the intima and addingto plaque. It delivers carbon monoxide, which stops red blood cells from deliv-ering oxygen the body needs. Cigarette smoke delivers carcinogens to other or-gans through the lungs and to all the body's organs through the bloodstream. Itdamages small blood vessels in arms and legs, causing or worsening peripheralvascular disease. Ultrasound studies in Finland have shown cigarette smoking causes distinctive small vascular lesions of its own (other than sclerotic plaque), which can be de-tected in carotid arteries. They may also be found in other parts of the bodyonce the techniques can be applied. Low density serum lipids. Research has advanced well beyond its concern about \"cholesterol\" to the point of identifying different kinds of cholesterol, dif-ferent types of lipoproteins that carry them, and numerous interacting bio-chemicals. The \"bottom line\" for preventive medicine remains much the same:limit the consumption of meat, dairy products, or any other foods rich in fatsthat are solid or pasty at room temperature (liquid oils, in moderation, are bet-ter); engage in regular exercise to burn calories and help convert some of thebody's harmful, low density cholesterol into protective, high density cholesterol;avoid weight gain\u2014adding fat to the body pumps fats into the bloodstream andonto the vessel walls. Diabetes mellitus. Diabetes is a very strong risk factor for ischemic heart dis- ease and all atherosclerotic diseases. The degree of its contribution to cardiovas-cular mortality in a population depends on its prevalence in the population andon how well blood sugar levels are controlled in patients. 193 DISEASES OF THE HEART AND BLOOD VESSELSIschemic heart disease, although not an infectious disease, spreads like anepidemic, propelled by cultural change.51331_p199_220_r1 4/7/03 3:18 PM Page 193Obesity. Obesity is a precursor and contributor to many of the mentioned risk factors\u2014it raises blood pressure, it raises low density serum lipids. It sits in thesame lounge chair as sedentary lifestyle. It helps cause adult-onset diabetes.Some overweight smokers even say that they don't want to give up cigarettes lestthey gain more weight! Obesity can be reversed effectively, and smoking can bestopped, too. Psychosocial and behavioral factors. The power of emotions and behaviors, other than the risk behaviors discussed above, to contribute to ischemic heartdisease/coronary heart disease risk continues to be debated. This is a difficultarea for research measurement, and there are many reasons why studies may notagree. Yet over the past 35 years, enough large studies have been reported toallow some general statements. Anxiety and neuroticism seem to be related primarily to angina pectoris, usually not to myocardial infarction. Depression is a powerful risk factor for poor recovery and fatal outcome of is- chemic heart disease and other diseases; it also relates to a progression of ather-osclerosis in living patients and other harmful physiological changes. Anger, hostility, and aggression have been associated with ischemic heart disease endpoints, according to many studies conducted in the 1980s and the 1990s.Hostility shares with the Type A Behavior Pattern (discussed below) the elementof frequent arousal of the autonomic nervous system. Such arousals raise bloodpressure briefly but acutely, and also cause bursts of noradrenaline secretionwhich irritate arterial intima making it more susceptible to atherosclerotic plaque. Chronic sleep disturbance also has been implicated. Whether it involves trouble falling asleep, multiple awakenings in the night, awaking far too early and beingunable to return to sleep, or awakening feeling tired and worn out after one'susual amount of sleep, these signs, when long lasting, raise the risk of ischemicheart disease. Prolonged sleep-deprivation can cause many negative impacts onhealth, including a higher mortality rate. Certain occupational conditions sometimes place high demands on workers but leave them little or no flexibility as to how to meet those demands. Workers onassembly lines that move too rapidly are an example, and here, it is the psycho-logical strain, rather than the physical one, that seems to be responsible for rais-ing risk of disease. A behavioral style of continual intense activation also seems to put people at higher risk of ischemic heart disease. This style of behavior describes people whoare \"always on the go\" and always in a hurry, who are competitive, aggressive, 194 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p199_220_r1 4/7/03 3:18 PM Page 194and have difficulty relaxing\u2014the Type A Behavior Pattern. Research has shown prospective associations between chronic hyperarousal and ischemic heart dis-ease, and also has identified pathophysiological pathways that link them. TheType A risk factor appears to have reduced its predictive strength in some de-veloped nations, but it has become a predictive factor for ischemic heart diseasein transitional nations where people of higher social status still have greater is-chemic heart disease rates than persons with lower education and job prestige. Socioeconomic status. The natural history of the rise and fall of the ischemic heart disease epidemic in a society is that it begins as a disease of the upperclasses, then, over the course of several decades, moves into the working class.This seems to happen as the working classes take on lifestyle habits of more pres-tigious people\u2014smoking cigarettes, eating more fatty foods, becoming moresedentary. Innovation begins in more educated and cosmopolitan groups\u2014bothin the onset of risk factors and in the acquisition of protective factors. Hence, thewidespread adoption of healthier behaviors also begins higher on the social lad-der. This leaves persons at middle and lower socioeconomic levels in Western andNorthern Europe, Australia, Canada, and the United States the victims of thefirst (unhealthy) risk factors and not yet the beneficiaries of a \"health revolu-tion.\" This world phenomenon is not something health professionals can \"treat,\"but the information can be used to identify higher risk groups and prepare pri-mary prevention outreach. (Specific approaches for tobacco, dietary, and screening programs will be dealt with in Chapter 12.) Older age. Rates of ischemic heart disease and most other chronic diseases ad- vance sharply with age. Obviously, this risk factor cannot be changed directly,but it need not be a measure of \"exposure\" to risk, if changeable risk factors arecorrected earlier in life. The calendar does not count one's age as truly as doesone's body and behavior. Healthy living, not the years behind one, predicts thequality and quantity of years ahead. Protective Factors Briefly stated, eliminating the risk factors listed above is a community's and anindividual's best protection against ischemic heart disease and its costs. Peoplecan increase physical activity, stop smoking, eat a healthier diet, lose weight,control blood pressure, and find ways to escape stress. These six tasks are not allseparate, they interact and promote each other. Some epidemiologic data sug-gest that persons who consume about one alcoholic drink per day (usually oneglass of wine or beer) are better protected from heart attack and possibly strokethan those people who never consume alcohol or those who consume two ormore drinks per day. It is not yet fully established whether this effect is due tothe alcohol itself, other components of the beverages, or to other characteristics 195 DISEASES OF THE HEART AND BLOOD VESSELS51331_p199_220_r1 4/7/03 3:18 PM Page 195of lifestyle or temperament of this distinct group. Given the tendency for alco- hol to become abused and lead to many other pathologies, we recommend saferways to reduce heart disease risk. Another protective factor is female gender until the age of menopause. After that, women experience the rising gradient of risk that men went through ten yearsearlier. In industrialized areas, ischemic heart disease becomes the leading specificcause of death in women after about age 55. In developing and transitional na-tions stroke and cancers usually lead women's causes of death until age 65. International studies have shown that reducing consumption of animal protein and increasing proteins from plants (especially soy beans) lowers levels of lowdensity (unhealthy) cholesterol. Other legume plants (from the family of peasand beans) are also protective (Blaufox and Langford, 1987, pp. 246ff). CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES\u2014\"STROKE\" Cerebrovascular diseases are caused by pathology in the blood vessels to thebrain. When these vessels get blocked by atherosclerosis, a thrombus, or an em-bolus, the blood supply to the brain is cut off, and many neurons die. When ananeurysm (bulging of a weak area of the blood vessel) occurs, pressure squeezesthe brain and pathways malfunction. If a vessel tears or bursts, a hemorrhage oc-curs; the blood spilled into the space of the neurons also destroys their normalactivity. The result in each case is neurological damage extending to the parts ofthe body controlled by the damaged or dead nerves. Depending on the locationand size of the brain damage, permanent disability or death may follow. The incidence of stroke is low in younger adults. The GBD Study estimates worldwide death rates to be about 12.6 per 100,000 for persons ages 30-44years old (Murray and Lopez, 1996). By age 70 and older, the rate has multi-plied more than 100 times\u2014to 1,334 per 100,000! Men tend to be at higherrisk than women, up until the late 60s. Cerebrovascular diseases rank secondonly to ischemic heart disease as the leading cause of disability and death com-bined (DALYs) in the world for both women and men from age 45 to the endof the lifespan. The regions with the highest prevalence of hypertension, China and Sub-Saharan Africa, also have the highest rates of cerebrovascular deaths as a percentage oftotal cardiovascular mortality. This is not surprising, since high blood pressureis by far the most potent risk factor for stroke. Incidence of and mortality from cerebrovascular diseases have fluctuated during much of the 20th century, with unmistakable declines apparent in the post- 196 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p199_220_r1 4/7/03 3:18 PM Page 196industrialized countries since about 1970. This has been credited largely to the programs of blood pressure screening and treatment by pharmaceuticals andnow also by lifestyle changes. Randomized clinical trials in several nations have shown that the incidence of strokes can be reduced sharply and cost-effectively by lowering blood pressure.Most such trials have used antihypertensivedrugs, especially diuretics, to achieve thisgoal. The consensus of findings is that forevery 6 mmHg reduction in diastolic bloodpressure maintained over five years, there is about a 40% reduction in the incidence of strokes (Yusuf et al., 1993; MacMahon,1996). This is a remarkably large saving oflives for a small reduction in blood pressure.These findings apply to groups of mild to moderate hypertensives and greater re-ductions might be achieved in severe hypertensives or other maximal risk groups. Risk Factors Hypertension. High blood pressure raises the risk of stroke three to four times that of people with normal blood pressure. Both systolic and diastolic elevationsraise risk in proportion to their elevations at all ages. It is claimed that up to 70%of strokes can be prevented by reduction of blood pressure (Gorelick, 1995). Age. Stroke risk increases with age, rising especially rapidly after age 60. Re- ducing blood pressure reduces stroke risk even in people over 80 years old, how-ever (Cheng (ed.), 1986, Chapter 43). Dietary factors. Too much salt and other sources of sodium; inadequate dietary potassium and calcium. Cardiac diseases. These include atherosclerosis (ischemic heart disease), left ventricular hypertrophy, congestive failure, or mitral stenosiscaused by rheumatic fever. Diabetes mellitus. Diabetes leads to adverse changes in blood vessels through- out the body, and to stroke. Cigarette smoking. This is an independent risk factor for stroke; its impact fol- lows a dose-response curve. Sickle cell disease. By reducing the ease of blood flow, this disease raises the probability of blockage of smaller arteries and, thus, of stroke. 197 DISEASES OF THE HEART AND BLOOD VESSELSCerebrovascular diseases rank second only to ischemic heart disease as theleading cause of disability and deathcombined (DALYs) in the world forboth women and men from age 45 tothe end of the lifespan.51331_p199_220_r1 4/7/03 3:18 PM Page 197Depression. This condition influences both the incidence and severity of strokes. In some studies, hypertensives with serious depression had about 2.5times the rate of strokes as non-depressed hypertensives. As with many otherconditions, depressed persons have an elevated risk of their stroke being fatal orof their recovery being delayed (Simonsick et al., 1995). All other risk factors for hypertension. Obesity, alcohol consumption, lack of exercise. See the section on high blood pressure earlier in this chapter. Some have proposed race as a risk factor, too. In the United States, for example, African Americans have about twice the rates of hypertension, hypertensiveheart disease, and stroke as White Americans. This fact has been seen as a cor-nerstone for the belief that racial genetics is an important determinant of risk,intensity, and sequellae of hypertension. Recent international epidemiologicstudies, however, show that White Americans have more hypertension thanWest Africans, who have similar genetic heritage as African Americans. Further,it was found that Africans living in rural areas have lower blood pressures thanthose living in cities. As people migrate to urban areas their blood pressures andrate of hypertension go up. Studies of Pacific Islanders concur that urbanizationinto Western lifestyles raises blood pressure. These international findings allowgenetics, in the form of family aggregation of hypertension, as a risk factor, butsuggest that the interaction of genetics with environment, particularly a rapidlychanging environment or a stressful or punitive environment, is the more pow- 198 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHWARNING SIGNALS OF TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACKS Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are beyond the state of a risk factor. They are a sign of emerging cerebrovascular disease that often occurs shortly before a serious stroke. A TIAconsists of brief neurological symptoms such as: sudden weakness or numbness on one side of body\u2014face, arm, leg; sudden darkening or loss of vision, usually in one eye; difficulty in talking or understanding others; unexplained dizziness or sudden falling. Most TIAs clear up in five minutes to an hour, and the person feels well again. If such symptoms persist beyond 24 hours, they are diagnosed as a cerebrovascular accident\u2014astroke. The public should recognize the importance of the above signs, especially if morethan one occur together. Since a TIA is a warning announcing the likely arrival of a vascu-lar crisis in the brain, it is to be used as a signal to seek prompt medical attention. Peoplewho experience TIAs have a tenfold increased risk for a stroke coming soon than others.Hence, health professionals at all levels of background should arrange for prompt care.Blood pressure should be measured and, if too high, reduced immediately. Clotting factorsin the blood should be assessed and treated. A period of medical observation or furtherdiagnosis may be indicated. The patient should be cautioned to avoid behaviors or cir-cumstances likely to raise blood pressure acutely. Strokes cannot be \"cured,\" but most\u2014maybe even 70%\u2014can be prevented.51331_p199_220_r1 4/7/03 3:18 PM Page 198erful (and more modifiable) cause of elevated hypertension and stroke rates in population groups. Asian races, such as Chinese and Japanese, also manifest high prevalence of hy- pertension and its pathological outcomes. Dietary factors (high sodium, lowpotassium, low calcium) may play a more important role than race. Witness thegeographic gradient of twice as much hypertension and stroke fatality in north-ern China compared to southern China. In both areas 95% of people are ofHan ancestry, but diet and aspects of the culture are quite different. Protective Factors Since hypertension is a stepping stone on the path to cerebrovascular disease, allthe protective factors for that condition apply here also. Removing the risk fac-tors above confers much protection. Reinforcing the protective factors person-by-person is the usual approach in a clinical setting, but this will make little overall impact in the community. To dothat, the population approach, not the high risk approach, must be pursued.This can be achieved throughout the life cycle, wherever groups eat together orlive together. From childhood to old age, schools, group housing, the military,factory lunch rooms, hospitals, and meal services for the elderly can reducesodium and increase potassium and calcium in foods served. Institutions alsocan discourage cigarette smoking, drinking more than two alcoholic drinks perday, and obesity. They also can encourage regular exercise and stress reductiontechniques when indicated. PROTECTION SUMMARY In summary, the key to reducing diseases of the heart and blood vessels is to re-duce risk factors and promote protective factors in whatever group one serves.Someone might only be able to help his or her family: then that's what shouldbe done. A smaller target group can provide more focus, intensity, and success.For those with influence on factories, offices, or schools, there is much that canbe achieved in these settings. The next step is to influence communities andlarger groups using proven population approaches to enhance health. 199 DISEASES OF THE HEART AND BLOOD VESSELS51331_p199_220_r1 4/7/03 3:18 PM Page 1999. Cancers In all cancers, cell nuclei lose their ability to control cell growth and multipli- cation. As a result, primitive kinds of cells rapidly proliferate. When these \"wildcells\" invade nearby tissues\u2014damaging organs and systems\u2014the process is con-sidered malignant. If these growing cell clusters are not removed or stopped, the\"host\" will die. For cells to become \"cancerous,\" they usually must sustain often-repeated phys- ical or chemical damage. In fact, most persons sustain this sort of damage ratherfrequently, but fortunately most also have a well-functioning immune systemthat finds and destroys such cells continually. However, if the damage proves tobe greater than the body's ability to fight it, a malignant neoplasm\u2014cancer\u2014will develop. Cancers also can occur in blood-forming tissues and in the blood.Some abnormal growths may not invade othertissues and may not be life-threatening; theseare called benign tumors. Cancers rank among the leading causes of death in every nation. Nevertheless, there aregreat differences across cultures and environ-ments in the rates of cancer at specific sites.Neoplasms of the lung, breast, and colon, for example, lead the list in industri-alized nations. In developing countries, on the other hand, cancers of the stom-ach, liver, and cervix uteri are the major cancer killers. Data estimate that be-tween 80% and 85% of all cancers are determined by lifestyle and environmentalfactors (McGinnis and Foege, 1993). In developed countries, industrial exposureaccounts for only about 5% of malignancies (Higginson, 1980). In developingcountries, the percentage is higher, given the fact that in these countries' healthand safety regulations are generally fewer and less consistently enforced. Not sur-prisingly, many industrialists in regulated, developed countries are moving car-cinogenic manufacturing to developing countries. While some cancer risks arepassed on partly by genetic processes, environmental or lifestyle factors still mustrelease, or suppress, their expression. That means that environmental and behav-ioral changes are vital components of all cancer prevention programs. These huge geographic differences prove that specific cancers are not inevitable. And, no nation has to accept high incidence and mortality rates. If only everynation could adopt both the lifestyle that keeps lung, breast, and colon cancersrare in developing countries andthe lifestyle that keeps cancers of the stomach, 201 CANCERSCancers rank among the leading causes of death in every nation, althoughthere are vast differences acrosscultures and environments in the ratesat specific sites.51331_p221_246_r1 4/7/03 2:30 PM Page 201liver, and uterine cervix infrequent in industrialized countries, this planet's over- all population would have much lower mortality from these diseases. The development of a malignant neoplasm is not as simple as that of an infec- tious disease. Research into causes (etiology) and processes (pathogenesis) ofcancers indicates that at least two exposure events are necessary for the malig- nancy to develop\u2014an initiating event and apromoting event. The \"causes\" of any malig-nancy are multiple, and it often takes manyyears for the process to advance far enough tobe clinically apparent. All the while, the body's biochemical and immunological systems are fighting to destroy the mutatedcells that might replicate themselves to become tumors. Much research is un-derway to spell out the full story behind this over-simplified outline. Mean-while, our preliminary information tells us that we can prevent many cases ofcancer with a three-pronged approach: Reduce contact with the \"initiator carcinogens,\" Reduce contact with the \"promoter carcinogens,\" and Strengthen the body's natural defenses. DIGESTIVE SYSTEM CANCERS Based on data from 1992 to 1995 for 19 of the most populous countries of theAmericas, digestive system cancers\u2014cancers of the esophagus, stomach, smallintestine, liver, pancreas, other digestive organs, and perito-neum 1\u2014cause more deaths than cancers of the trachea, bronchus, and lung2 combined (PAHO, 1995). This holds for women in all 19 countries in the Region of the Americas, among whom digestive system cancers are responsible for 21% to 48% of all cancerdeaths. In men in all countries except Canada, Cuba, and the United States,those cancers also inflict the most cancer deaths. 3Digestive cancers in men range from 24% to 50% of total cancer deaths, whereas trachea, bronchus, andlung cancers range from 8% in El Salvador and Nicaragua to 34% in the United 202 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH1ICD-9, 150-159. 2ICD-9, 162. 3This pattern is changing: trachea, bronchus, and lung cancers are rapidly increasing for both women and men. Moreover, the excess in gastrointestinal mortality is greatest in the oldest agegroups. As these cohorts die and middle-aged smokers become the oldest generations, respiratorycancers will become the most common cancers.Both an initiating event and a promoting event are necessary for a malignancy to develop.51331_p221_246_r1 4/7/03 2:30 PM Page 202States (PAHO, 1992, 1995). Clearly, high priority should be given to the pre- vention of digestive cancers in most countries. Digestive system cancers ranked high as a cause of death all over the world in the early 20th century, but have been declining for at least 50 years. This decline par-allels the process of industrialization. And while the sociobiological mechanismsinvolved are still incompletely understood, the decline in stomach cancers tendsto coincide with the implementation of more hygienic food processing and stor-age by preservation in air-tight containers, freezing, or other means that use min-imal salt and halt microbial growth. Esophageal, colorectal, and liver cancers fol-low from other contributing causes, and will be dealt with individually. STOMACH CANCER Industrialized nations experience the lowest rates for stomach cancer, while at the same time having higher rates of colon cancer. Developing and transition-ing nations have high rates of stomach neoplasms (and their deaths), whilst gen-erally having infrequent cancer of the colon. WHO estimates that annuallythere are about 575,000 deaths in the world due to stomach cancer, with300,000 occurring in developing countries (Hansluwka, 1986). Geographicalhigh-risk areas include Japan, Korea, South and Central America, Eastern andNorthern Europe, East and South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. The huge na-tional differences in stomach neoplasm mortality are explained largely by thecurrently known risk factors and protective factors. Men typically generate twoto three times the incidence compared to women. Risk Factors Consuming diets high in salty foods and those to which sodium chloride or monosodium glutamate have been added. These include foods pre- served by salt or brine (Riboli, 1996; T richopoulos and Willett, 1996). Eating foods containing nitrites (often used as a preservative) or nitratesthat stomach bacteria can convert easily into nitrites or nitrosamines. Pre- liminary evidence also points to the fact that N-nitroso compounds may raisethe risk of malignancies in other sites such as the esophagus, colon, or bladder. Smoking cigarettes. Smoking has been associated, on average, with a 50% excess in stomach cancers in eight cohort studies. Chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori .Infection with this bacteria greatly raises the risk for peptic ulcers, which may, in time, lay the foundationfor gastric cancer. Whether uncomplicated peptic ulcer itself is a risk factor is 203 CANCERS51331_p221_246_r1 4/7/03 2:30 PM Page 203still debated. It appears that H. pylori infection might require co-carcinogens or deficiencies in protective factors in order to result in cancer. Because H. py- loribacteria are transmitted primarily via the fecal-oral route, improved sani- tation could reduce both its transmission and the frequency of reinfection. Atrophic gastritis. This condition often is a forerunner to gastric carcinoma. The atrophic state may follow from pernicious anemia, reflux of bile acidsthrough the pyloris, or from ingested irritants such as salt and, especially,alcohol. Protective Factors Eating vegetables, salads, and fruits every day. These have been shown the strongest and most consistent protective factor supported by studies all overthe world. Green and yellow vegetables and those of the broccoli-cabbagefamily seem particularly protective against cancers of several sites. Fruits withvitamin C are also valuable (Riboli, 1996; T richopoulos and Willett, 1996,entire issue). Including animal proteins in the diet . Some studies have shown dairy products to be protective. This may be due both to the presence of calciumand fat-soluble vitamins. Including foods containing antioxidants, such as vitamin C (water solu- ble), vitamins E and A (fat soluble), and vitamin A's close relative, betacarotene, in the diet. Several clinical studies have supplemented participants' diets with these nutrients in the form of pills, but results have generally beendisappointing. Ingesting these nutrients in their natural chemical milieu invegetables, fruits, and other whole foods is not only more protective, but farcheaper. To prevent gastric cancers, it may be more efficient to add protective factors than to try and remove non-dietary risk factors. For example, changing eatinghabits to include more of the protective foods\u2014vegetables, salads, and fruits\u2014need not await national policies or economic development. Formal or informallocal groups can encourage families to plant vegetable and fruit gardens that in-clude protective foods appropriate to local climate and soil conditions. Even inclimates with long, cold winters, warm productive summers can yield producethat can be \"home canned\" without salt or preservatives and used throughoutthe year. Local schools can lead the way with demonstration gardens, with theadded bonus of teaching children and youth how to teach their families. Low levels of salt and sodium consumption seem likely to reduce a group's risk of gastric cancers and hypertension. And there are no adverse side effects. The 204 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p221_246_r1 4/7/03 2:30 PM Page 204human body's need for sodium is only a small fraction of the amount usually consumed. Salt restriction in adults may create a craving or hunger for it, butthis disappears in about a month as the body adapts to a lower intake. Mean-while non-mineral herbs and spices can give traditional foods new appealingflavors. CANCERS OF THE COLON AND RECTUM Colon cancer ranks as the third leading cause of cancer incidence and mortality for both men and women in the United States; it also takes a heavy toll in West-ern Europe. It is much less frequent in developing countries, especially in Africa,India, and China. The incidence of colon cancer is low in most of Central andSouth America, except Uruguay. Economically transitioning areas are seeing anincrease in rates, however. T wenty-fold differences in colon cancer mortality areseen across nations, arguing for strong environmental differences in the risk fac-tors. The gut's microenvironment, of course, is shaped by the ingested foodpassing through, and hence research into dietary practices has been rewarding. Cancers of the colon and rectum are often first discovered clinically when they cause intestinal blockage or after they have spread. Earlier detection can beachieved by regular check-ups for occult blood in the stool (but the test gener-ates many false positive results) and by colonoscopy. These procedures are tooexpensive for widespread community use, and so the population-wide strategyof prevention stands out as the one best hope. Fortunately, several strong riskfactors are known and can be changed. Risk Factors Having close relatives who have had colon cancer. How much of the risk is genetic and how much is due to a common lifestyle has not been apportioned.A person's family history and the presence of ulcerative colitis or adenomatouspolyps point to the need for more frequent follow-up for early detection. Col-orectal adenomatous polyps are considered to be a frequent precursor to can-cerous growth. They are commonly removed during colonoscopy as a pro-phylactic measure. Ulcerative colitis should be actively treated to reduce itschances of initiating neoplastic growth. Excessive consumption of red meat and animal fat. Excessive alcohol consumption. This has a stronger impact on rectal than on colon cancer. Obesity . This is a weaker risk (T richopoulos and Willett, 1996). 205 CANCERS51331_p221_246_r1 4/7/03 2:30 PM Page 205Tobacco smoking. This is a risk factor especially for adenomatous polyps (Schottenfeld and Fraumeni, 1996). Protective Factors Physical exercise. Exercise, especially walking, is the best proven risk reducer. A diet rich in vegetables and fruits, and other sources of fiber. Eating foods rich in calcium and folate. (Limited evidence.) Consuming fish and seafood. (Limited evidence.) Regular use of aspirin. The protective effect of aspirin strengthens with more years of regular use. Reducing risk factors and increasing protective factors for colon cancer fit into a single lifestyle package. The preventive power of regular physical exercise\u2014be it occupational, recreational, and/or leisure-related\u2014may come as a surprise tomany. Consider this, however: walking, walking and running as part of a sport,or doing work that requires total body exertion move the intestines into peri-staltic activity, shortening the time that digested and decomposed food\u2014andvarious naturally toxic, mutagenic, or carcinogenic chemicals\u2014remain in contactwith the lining of the small intestines, colon, and rectum. Hence, the exposureboth to cancer-initiating and promoting chemicals is reduced. However, neitherslowed transit time nor constipation has been linked directly to colorectal cancer.Exercise has a stronger protective effect for colon cancer than for rectal cancer. The risk and protective mechanisms of diet on colon cancer have not been fully proven yet. Many chemical interactions and the physical impact of fiber arebeing examined. Fortunately, the preventive messages are already well defined.The protective power of vegetables has been strongly documented (Potter, 1996,23 of 28 studies reviewed), as has the protective effect of fiber, whether fromvegetables, fruit, or whole grain sources. The risk-raising effects of meat proteinand fat also have been repeatedly confirmed (15 of the 19 studies). The effect of regular use of aspirin as a protector against colon cancers has been replicated in several nations. It may also reduce risk of esophageal and stomachcancers. Aspirin also inhibits the growth of colonic and rectal polyps, perhapsby means of inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. Given the known tendency foraspirin to irritate the stomach and help induce gastric bleeding, aspirin shouldbe taken in a buffered compound to reduce its acidity. Taking aspirin with ameal also protects the stomach lining. There is limited evidence that other non- 206 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p221_246_r1 4/7/03 2:30 PM Page 206steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) also may have a protective effect on parts of the gastrointestinal tract (Thun, 1996). The population strategy of prevention, as outlined in Chapter 2, calls for pro- grams to change culture and lifestyle. These programs should emphasize stom-ach and colon cancer prevention, as well as the prevention of ischemic heart dis-ease and diabetes. Moreover, programs should emphasize how these changes canmake a person feel better immediately, and have more vitality and endurance.The drama of victory over digestive cancers has the same plot as many of thepreventive dramas in this book. More exercise. More vegetables, fruits, andwhole grains. Less red meat and fats. Reduce overweight. Reduce or quit use ofalcohol and tobacco (Potter, 1996; Colditz, 1997). CANCERS OF THE ORAL CAVITY, ESOPHAGUS, LARYNX, AND PHARYNX These cancers are discussed together because they have adjacent locations and share similar risk and protective factors. Moreover, cancers of neighboring sitesare sometimes difficult to distinguish clinically, especially after the growth hasspread. These head and neck cancers generally have a high mortality rate. People living in poverty and poorly nourished persons are at higher risk. Southeast Asia and theMiddle East experience the greatest incidence of these malignancies, althoughthey are of some concern everywhere. N.C.Madan and colleagues (1986) report that ofall diagnosed cancers in India's provinces,30% to 45% are cancers of the mouth andthroat. Elsewhere in the world, the propor-tion can dip as low as 5%. There are about300,000 new cases of esophageal cancer inthe world each year, 80% of which are in developing countries. France has thehighest incidence of cancers of the pharynx and surrounding tissues. Epstein-Barrviral infection appears to be involved in many cancers of the pharynx, and thehuman papilloma virus has been linked to some oral cancers. Risk Factors The major risk factors are heavy tobacco use, including smoking, chewing, orholding tobacco between the gums and cheek, as \"snuff\" users do. In Asia, thehabit of chewing mixtures of betel nut (areca), lime, or tobacco is responsible fortens of thousands of these malignancies each year. Cigar- and pipe-smoking can 207 CANCERSCombining excessive alcohol consumption with tobacco usemultiplies the risk for cancers of theoral cavity, esophagus, and pharynx.51331_p221_246_r1 4/7/03 2:30 PM Page 207trigger lip and tongue cancers. Drinking alcohol also causes head and neck can- cers, and combining excessive alcohol consumption with tobacco use multipliesthe risk. In the Far East, routine consumption of aged, pickled, and moldedfoods is a major risk. Poor oral hygiene and lack of dental care are commonly cited as contributing causes to cancers in the mouth. The chronic irritation from long-term use ofpoorly fitted dentures has been blamed for some cases. Drinking extremely hotbeverages has been implicated in raising the risk of esophageal cancer in China,India, and Latin America. The repeated scorching of oral and esophageal mu-cosa appears to promote such lesions. Protective Factors Once again, protective factors include the generous consumption of vegetables and fruits. Studies of laryngeal and pharyngeal neoplasms add fish and vegetableoils (polyunsaturated) to the list of protective foods. Prevention of this class ofcancers should focus on reducing the use of the most potent carcinogens: to-bacco, alcohol, and, where indicated, betel nut and the like. The effort will re-quire education and a cultural shift to accomplish this in highly endemic areas. CANCER OF THE LIVER Also called hepatocellular carcinoma, cancer of the liver varies widely by region. It is relatively infrequent in Latin America, but it is a major killer in Asia, China,Thailand and Japan, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Overall, liver carcinoma is one ofthe top ten causes of cancer deaths in the world (Parkin et al., 1997). In areas with high rates of liver cancer, most cases are secondary consequences of infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or the presence of aflatoxin in foods.Aflatoxin, produced by certain fungi that spread through grains and other cropsin warm, moist climates, is particularly destructive to liver cells. As the nameimplies, hepatitis viruses can cause disabling or fatal liver damage; types B andC are more likely to precipitate neoplasms. These infections, toxic exposures, and the excessive drinking of alcohol can cause cirrhosis of the liver, and this can be an intermediary to liver cancer. In 1976,Shikata estimated that 60% to 90% of liver cancers, depending on region,emerge from livers that are already cirrhotic (cited by London and McGlynn,1996). In regions relatively free of aflatoxin, excess alcohol use is the major riskfactor, followed by hepatitis B. Hepatitis C virus also is a potent cause of hepaticcancers. As hepatitis C spreads more widely, it will be responsible for an in-creasing proportion of liver cancers. 208 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p221_246_r1 4/7/03 2:30 PM Page 208Prevention Because of the major geographic disparities in the causes of liver cancer, preven- tion efforts must be tailored to local conditions. A sampling of programs follows: Vaccinating infants against hepatitis B. In high prevalence areas, this wouldmean universal vaccination. Improving hygiene to reduce perinatal and person-to-person contact withbody fluids and blood products that may carry the hepatitis B virus. Reducing the number of sexual partners, encouraging sexual hygiene, and disseminating \"safer sex\" guidelines to reduce the spread of hepatitis B andhuman papilloma virus. Reducing intravenous drug use, especially sharing or reusing needles. Testing blood donations for hepatitis B (and for HIV and other infections)and establishing measures to stop transmission in hospitals and clinics. Vaccinating adults at high risk for hepatitis B, such as hospital workers andclose contacts of hepatitis B cases and carriers. Reducing alcohol use, especially among heavy drinkers. Preventing occupational exposure to liver-damaging chemicals. Setting up systems for storing and drying grains and bulk foods that protect against aflatoxin-generating fungi. CANCERS OF THE TRACHEA, BRONCHUS, AND LUNG These cancers are treated together because they share similar risk factors and protective mechanisms. After all, they all depend on the air we breathe. More-over, these cancers are treated as a combined category in international mortalityreporting. The trachea (windpipe), bronchus, and lung are the cancer sites which contribute most tocancer mortality in the majority of industri-alized nations. Countries undergoing a tran-sition into full economic development also are experiencing the developedworld's epidemic of tobacco use. As a result, trachea, bronchus, and lung cancerswill rise in the latter countries, soon to surpass every other cancer. 209 CANCERSCancers of the trachea, bronchus, and lung share similar factors andprotective mechanisms\u2014after all, theyall depend on the air we breathe.51331_p221_246_r1 4/7/03 2:30 PM Page 209Occupations that put workers in contact with airborne dust\u2014such as coal min- ing, ore mining, and quarrying\u2014or industrial emissions of smoke, gases, andchemicals also raise the rates of these cancers among persons exposed. It should be noted, however, that the contribution of thesefactors to these cancers' rates in the total populationis much smaller that that of tobacco. Undergroundminers exposed to the radioactive gas radon havemore trachea, bronchus, and lung cancers, but ef-forts to link household radon levels to these cancershave been mostly unsuccessful. The effect of indus- trial exposure is compounded if workers also smoke tobacco. Conversely, ratesfor these cancers are very low in countries where tobacco is rarely used. As of the 1990s, the world's highest mortality rates from trachea, bronchus, and lung cancers were among African-American men, New Zealand Maori men,and men living in coal mining areas of Poland, the Netherlands, and Scotland(Parkin et al., 1997). Air pollution\u2014from smoke, auto exhaust, improperly vented home heating sys- tems, or industrial emissions\u2014has long been implicated in lung cancer andchronic pulmonary disease. In post-industrialized nations, the direct impact ofair pollution on cancer is usually overestimated, until tobacco-smoking is prop-erly considered. In industrializing areas that have extremely high pollutantloads, especially inside buildings, cancer rates can rise by 20% to 50% (Blot andFraumeni, 1996). In every country the world over, the rates of trachea, bronchus, and lung cancers in men are higher than those in women. In urban areas where tobacco advertis-ing targets women, however, these cancers are rising to become the leadingcause of cancer mortality among women. There is about a 20-year incubation period for lung cancer. In what might be called \"a natural cultural experiment\" in the United States, cigarette smokingbecame common among men early in the 1900s, rising sharply in popularityduring World War I and through the 1920s. Men's lung cancer mortality, whichalready was rising in the 1930s, increased dramatically since about 1945. Forwomen in the United states, smoking became not only acceptable but also chicduring World War II. T rachea, bronchus, and lung cancer mortality in women,which had been the lowest of all cancers in women, began rising rapidly in theearly 1960s, and continued its sharp increase until it became the leading causeof cancer death in women in the United States in the late 1980s\u2014surpassingbreast cancer and cancers in any other sites. Cigarette smoking became hyperendemic among men in China starting in the 1980s, with 60% to 70% of Chinese men smoking in the 1990s. The epidemic 210 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHIn every country the world over, the rates of trachea, bronchus, and lung cancers in men are higher than those in women.51331_p221_246_r1 4/7/03 2:30 PM Page 210of trachea, bronchus, and lung cancers can be expected to reach alarming pro- portions in the first decade of the 21st century, with estimated deaths reaching500,000 per year in that country. These deaths will be in addition to the cur-rent annual burden of approximately three million deaths due to tobacco-related diseases worldwide\u2014about one tobacco-related death every 10 seconds(World Health Organization, 1997). Other nations lured into the \"tobacco epi-demic\" will contribute proportionally to this increase in mortality over the nexthalf-century. Of the world's 1.1 billion smokers around the year 2000, 800 mil-lion live in less developed countries. The sooner these countries act to stop themarketing and use of tobacco, the sooner their now unavoidable epidemics willsubside. Recent studies agree that a person need not be a tobacco user to suffer from to- bacco diseases and death. Several international studies have shown that second-hand smoke or \"environmental tobacco smoke\" damages fetuses, infants, chil-dren, spouses, and co-workers who breathe the same air as smokers. A prospective population study which followed 256,118 Japanese men and women aged 40 years and older for 17 years generated the following findings:the risk of lung cancer for nonsmoking women living with husbands whosmoked more than 20 cigarettes each day was 91% higher than that of non-smoking women who lived with nonsmoking husbands. The former also devel-oped considerably more cases of breast cancer and brain tumor (Hirayama,1986). Since about 1980, 30 additional epidemiologic studies have been re-ported that generally support this finding. Heavily smoking husbands raise theirnonsmoking wives' risks of trachea, bronchus, and lung cancers from tomore than 100% (London and McGlynn, 1996, p. 643). Other sections in this handbook that deal with pregnancy, infancy, childhood, and youth, as well as with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, further docu-ment the damage that tobacco use inflicts on families. (The section \"Tobacco Use\" in Chapter 13 discusses interventions to prevent and help stop to-bacco usage.) Risk Factors Smoking cigarettes and, to a lesser degree, cigars, pipes, and other forms of tobacco. This accounts for at least 80% of cases of lung cancer. Exposure to radon. Radon is a radioactive gas emerging from uranium and soils containing this element. Uranium workers and miners for coal or orewho work underground in the vicinity of uranium deposits are at highest risk.Radon gas attaches to dust and aerosol surfaces, entering the body as onebreathes. Radon is odorless, and colorless. Smoking CANCERS51331_p221_246_r1 and Lang, 1993, pp. 922-923). Radon is of little concern in most parts of the world. Asbestos exposure. This mineral has a long history for causing asbestosis and laryngeal and gastrointestinal cancers, as well as having a major impact onlung cancer. Persons who work with insulation materials, in shipyards, rail-way yards, and brake factories are at highest risk of encountering this min-eral. Concerted efforts are under way in many countries to eliminate asbestosfrom products and from public buildings. Exposure to other industrial dusts and gases. Exposure to such compounds as arsenic, chromium processing compounds, coal tar, diesel exhaust, andsoot causes additional malignancies of the respiratory apparatus. Various min-ing, smelting, and refining processes contribute risk, unless their airborne ef-fluents are safely contained. Protective Factors Breathing the cleanest air possible. Avoid tobacco smoke and steer clear of places that have cigarette smoke or smoke from stoves, heaters, or othersources. Industries that generate smoke, fumes, and dust should protect work-ers by providing adequate venting, filters, precipitators, and the like, or by dis-tributing breathing masks that effectively remove all airborne pathogens. Dietary habits emphasizing vegetables and fruits. Vegetables and fruits containing vitamin A and beta-carotene are particularly protective. It shouldbe noted, however, that some clinical trials with beta-carotene in pill formhave been unsuccessful and others were stopped prematurely because thesupplement either raised the incidence of lung cancer or strokes (Riboli,1996). The protective effect of vegetables and fruits has been supported byecologic, case-control, and other study designs in several countries. Therefore,these foods can safely be incorporated into community programs. Social Influences Although cigarette smoking is a habit of individuals, it invades communitiesunder the umbrella of a social norm. Tobacco advertising targeted towardsyoung people shows rich and attractive people smoking, and portrays smokingas a \"cool\" habit. Once the habit takes hold, nicotine's addictive properties makeit difficult to get rid of the habit. Prevention and control of tobacco use are best achieved by policy actions at the sociopolitical level and by cultural change, reaching children and young people 212 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p221_246_r1 4/7/03 2:30 PM Page 212through schools, youth groups, the mass media, religious groups, health profes- sionals, and families. This is a moment of opportunity for nations to make a pre-emptive strike against smoking before smoking becomes socially acceptable and their societies fall prey to its addiction. Primary schools are the ideal place tostart implanting anti-tobacco attitudes andfeelings as well as disseminating knowl-edge about its ill effects. This is the time toteach refusal skills to children and youth\u2014to teach them how to refuse the offer offree tobacco. Children thus taught will thenbecome teachers to their families and thecommunity at large. Adding import restrictions, imposing higher taxes, barringthe sale of tobacco products to persons under age 17 or 18, and making healthfacilities and public buildings smoke free also will reduce cigarette usage. T raditional cultures and communities also must impress upon their women and girls that they do not have to copy the ignorance and weakness of those menand boys who have allowed themselves to be victimized by tobacco habits. Girlsand women, the great majority of whom are still non-smokers, can remainwiser, stronger, and healthier than male smokers by resisting what is obviouslya self-destructive addiction, one that has dire health and economic conse-quences even for the tobacco-free members of the family. (See further pre- ventive efforts in the section \"Tobacco Use\" in Chapter 13.) CANCER OF THE BLADDER Cancer of the bladder is relatively infrequent in North America and Western Europe, more common in South America and the Caribbean, and a major causeof cancer death in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. Where schistosomiasis isprevalent, cancer of the bladder is endemic. The parasitic flukes and eggs circu-late throughout the body's systems, including blood and lymph vessels, heart,digestive system, and bladder. Relatively few of the thousands of cases of schis-tosomiasis finally initiate a cancer in the bladder, but enough do to make it acommon malignancy in some countries. Elsewhere, the main established risk factor is cigarette smoking. Some of the in- haled carcinogens are stored in the bladder until discharged. Many chemicalsused in the rubber, shoe, and crude oil refining industries also target the bladder. Protective actions include avoiding the above exposures, plus eating vegetables and fruits every day. No other dietary associations have been demonstrated yet.Individuals and families can quit smoking or never start, as well as incorporatehealthy eating habits. However, it requires continued governmental action todeal with the exposures to schistosomiasis and industrial chemicals. 213 CANCERSPrimary schools are the ideal place to start implanting anti-tobacco attitudesand feelings as well as disseminatingknowledge about its ill effects.51331_p221_246_r1 4/7/03 2:30 PM Page 213SKIN CANCERS Skin cancers are the most prevalent form of carcinoma in fair-skinned popula- tions. Fortunately, although they present themselves in several pathologicaltypes, most are easily detected, easily removed, and rarely cause death. The mostcommon types are basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas. About 99% aretreated successfully by local physicians. The main agent is exposure to the sun'sultraviolet rays. The vulnerability factor is fair complexion, or blonde or redhair. Anatomically, about 80% occur on the face, head, and neck. The most lethal type of skin cancer is malignant melanoma. It is increasing at an alarming rate (about 3% to 7% per year) among fair-skinned people, many ofwhom are overly dedicated to getting \"a healthy tan\" every summer or who areexposed to ultraviolet light in winter. It is mostly a cancer that affects youngeradults. The incidence of malignant melanoma in the populations of northernEuropean origins ranges from 3 to 20 per 100,000 population worldwide. Per-sons having Asian, Mediterranean, African, or Indigenous American descendentsare much more protected from skin cancers. Fortunately, most lesions are dis-covered and treated early enough to prevent death. Thanks to earlier detection,the five-year survival rate of diagnosed melanoma has risen from only 40% inthe 1940s to 80% in the late 1980s. Early lesions are flat and thin, less than0.76 mm penetration from the epidermis inward. Prompt surgical removal ofsuch early lesions assures survival. Melanomas usually appear in skin areas withthe most sun exposure, but some forms also occur in unexposed areas. This callsfor personal as well as health worker vigilance. The primary risk factor for skin cancers generally is exposure of unprotected white skin for many years to direct sunlight or repeated severe sunburn over a shorter period. The shorter wavelengths (less than 400 nm) of ultraviolet-Bradiation are most damaging because they penetrate the skin more deeply.Ozone in the atmosphere absorbs ultraviolet rays, but as ozone continues to bedepleted by certain air pollutants, sunburn problems will become more severeand more widespread. Ultraviolet-A rays contribute to retinal damage andcataracts, ultraviolet-B rays contribute to skin cancers, and both contribute topremature aging of the skin and the lens of the eye. Most people are protectedindoors, in that window glass blocks most ultraviolet-B and up to half of ultra-violet-A rays. It should be pointed out that total avoidance of exposure to thesun also is unhealthy. Sunshine helps generate vitamin D, which works with cal-cium to develop strong bones and teeth. Some sunshine is essential to life andhealth. It is the extremes that should be avoided. Occupational exposure can also cause skin cancers. Contact with coal tar, pitch, creosote, arsenic, and radium can be carcinogenic. 214 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p221_246_r1 4/7/03 2:30 PM Page 214Risk Factors The risk and protective factors are quite similar for all cell-types of skin cancer. The list here emphasizes those that have been best documented for malignantmelanoma. History of melanoma in a first-degree relative. Blonde or red hair. Marked freckling on upper back. History of three or more sunburns with blisters before age 20. History of three or more summers working at an outdoor job before age 20. Presence of actinic keratoses (skin lesions). According to R.J. Friedman and colleagues (1991), persons with three or more of the above risk factors have a 20-fold increased risk of developing malignantmelanoma. In addition, the following factors also identify high-risk persons: Eye color not brown. Inability of skin to tan; skin that gets red, then peels. Skin that has many moles. Environmental risks include: Living in tropical latitudes. Exposure to the sun in the middle of the day. Exposure to the sun at high altitudes. Exposure to bright reflections off water or snow. Attention should be paid during cloudy bright days. Clouds do not block ultra- violet-B rays and because the air feels cooler, people can get severely sunburntbefore they realize it. 215 CANCERS51331_p221_246_r1 4/7/03 2:30 PM Page 215Protective Factors Covering the skin with light-blocking clothing. Using umbrellas or wide-brimmed hats to protect the face and neck. Constantly protecting babies and young children, whose skin is ex- tremely vulnerable to sun damage. Using sunscreens. Lotions and creams should have enough sun protective factor\u2014labeled as \"SPF .\" An SPF value higher than 15 blocks about 90% ofultraviolet-B rays. For people with sensitive skin, SPF of 30 or more is rec-ommended. Sunscreen creams work best when applied 45 minutes beforegoing into the sun. Water-resistant sun creams \"hold on\" somewhat betterthrough perspiration and water contact while swimming, but do need re-application to regain their initial strength. After a base tan is established,lower SPF values may be tried. T urning tan is the skin's own effort to blockUV rays from penetrating. Teaching people to work out their own balance between sun exposureand sun protection. Any burn that hurts or stings for more than an hour or two is your body's way of saying: \"You've had too much sun. I'm hurting youto remind you not to do this again.\" Parents and those working with children \"taking control\" of children's sunexposure. Children get so involved in play and fun that they may resist com- ing out of the sun in time to avoid a burn. Prudent adult supervision has im-mediate value, and also can reduce the far future risks of malignant melanoma. Secondary Prevention People of all ages should be taught to check the skin over their entire body pe-riodically, looking for spots of changed color, rashes, raised growths on the skin,and, especially, dark moles. Suspicious changes or lesions should be brought to a health professional familiar with dermatology for more expert evaluation.Changes in congenital birthmarks anywhere on the body are also a reason forreferral. The key word here is changes . Any of the following changes in the spot or surrounding skin warrants a medical evaluation: color, size, shape, elevationfrom skin surface, sensation (tenderness, itching) (Friedman et al., 1991). Teachers, athletic coaches, and lifeguards, as well as health professionals, already are in good positions to be observant for skin lesions. Pre-cancerous changesusually appear on parts of the body frequently exposed to the sun. 216 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p221_246_r1 4/7/03 2:30 PM Page 216Thorisdottir and colleagues (1993) present a simple algorithm for estimating the risk that a mole, a \"skin sore,\" or pigmented skin spots may be, or may be-come, a malignant melanoma. It is as easy as A, B, C, D. Asymmetry\u2014one-half of the sore is not shaped like the other. Border of the lesion is irregular\u2014may have a scalloped or leafy edge or irregular points, perhaps irregular thickness.Color that varies across the lesion, possibly including two or three shades of tan, brown, black, blue, red, or white.Diameter\u2014usually greater than 6 mm (or about 14of an inch)\u2014the di- ameter of an average pencil. If more than one of these features are present, the person should be brought to a physician familiar with dermatology for a definite diagnosis. Such active casefinding and diagnosis is mandatory because of the necessity of early diagnosis toprevent a melanoma from becoming fatal. Professional and public educationand early detection and referral can reverse this steadily rising death rate. CANCERS OF THE UTERINE CERVIX Cervical cancer is reported to be the second most common cancer in women in many parts of the world. Most nations of the world report cervical cancer incidence ranging between 5 to 20 per 100,000 population per year. Again, differences between countries based on economic development are large andtroubling, and they can be overcome. Many Latin American nations have inci-dence rates between 50 and 60 per 100,000population. In Peru, for example, the capi-tal, Lima, has an incidence rate of 27 per100,000, while the city of T rujillo has a rateof 54 per 100,000 (Parkin, 1997, pp. 803-1053). Jamaica and Mexico had the high-est cervical cancer mortality rates in theAmericas in the late 1980s. In the UnitedStates, there are ethnic differences, withHispanic, Korean, and African-Americanwomen having the highest cervical cancer rates in the country. Economic statusseems to be one of the strongest determinants. For example, before reunification,East Germany had about twice the rate of these cancers as West Germany (21and 11 per 100,000 population, respectively). A country's economic development is a potent determinant for the kind of fe- male cancer that is most prevalent and causes most deaths. In developing coun-tries, for instance, women have more cervical cancer, whereas in industrialized 217 CANCERSStudies of cervical cancer repeatedly show that this malignancy behaves likean infectious disease. It appears tobegin as a sexually transmitted viralinfection, and over time develops intoa neoplasm with uncontrolled cellularmultiplication and spread.51331_p221_246_r1 4/7/03 2:30 PM Page 217countries with fully developed infrastructure, breast cancer far outnumbers cer- vical cancers, both in incidence and number of deaths. As economic and healthservice development proceeds, an area's uterine cancer rates fall and breast can-cer rates increase simultaneously\u2014clear evidence that cultural changes affect thepopulation's way of living and its way of dying. Epidemiologic and clinical studies of cervical cancer repeatedly show that this malignancy behaves like an infectious disease. It appears to begin as a sexuallytransmitted viral infection, and over time develops into a neoplasm with un-controlled cellular multiplication and spread. Several viruses have been inten-sively studied in this connection, including herpes simplex 2, but most expertsnow attribute most cases of this cancer to prior infections with the human pa-pilloma virus (HPV). More than 60 types of HPV have been identified thus far:some have been shown to spark neoplasms and additional ones are being iden-tified. Among sexually active, healthy women, 20% to 50% (depending on thesample examined) have evidence of HPV infection, past or present. It is notknown whether they harbor a \"safe\" variant of HPV, or if they will develop cer-vical cancers in the future. The similarity of cervical cancers to late stage sexu-ally transmitted infections (STIs) is demonstrated by the risk factors. Risk Factors As the following list shows, risk factors for cervical cancer include both women'ssexual behavior and other lifestyle factors (Matzen and Lang (eds.), 1993, Chap-ter 30; Peters et al., 1986; Chin, 2000). Starting sexual intercourse soon after menarche. Compared to later starters, girls who start sexual relations before one year after menarche have26 times the risk; girls who become sexually active within one to five yearsafter menarche only have seven times the risk. Women who become sexually active before age 16. These women have 16 times the risk. Women who have had four or more sexual partners. These women have 3.6 times the risk of those who had none or one partner until the time of exam. Women with a history of genital warts caused by HPV. These women have 3.2 times the risk. Being married to a man who was previously married to a woman havingcervical cancer. Being married to a man who has penile or prostate cancer. Smoking cigarettes. This factor may be secondary to the above factors, however. 218 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p221_246_r1 4/7/03 2:30 PM Page 218Protective Factors Actions that reduce risk of STIs also reduce risk of HPV infections and, thus, of cervical cancer. Protection can be had by: Using condoms or other barrier protection. Both partners practicing monogamy. Both partners must have tested neg- ative for STIs, including HPV and HIV. Testing for all STIs and getting prompt treatment as necessary. (Also see the section \"Unsafe Sex\" in Chapter 13.) All the above relate to primary prevention. These should be given a greater pri- ority by health services, many of which rely only on screening for changes incervical tissue. All women testing positive on a Pap smear should be taught theseprimary risk and protective factors, to help them reduce risks of repeated infec-tion leading to more malignant tissue changes. Secondary Prevention The Papanicolaou (Pap) smear has become the primary weapon in the campaign to discover cervical tissue changes early enough to treat surgically and preventdeath. The sharp reductions in cervical cancer in economically advanced nationshave been attributed to effective screening of adult female populations with thistest. It is essential to note, however, that the downward trend in cervical cancermortality in the United States began more than a decade before the Pap smearwas widely available. Given this, one might conclude that something inherentin economic development helps to reduce mortality from this cause, perhaps ed-ucational improvements, fewer sexual partners, greater self-care among women,better hygiene, and better STI control. The effectiveness of cervical screening in reducing uterine cancer mortality is nolonger debated. Canada's well-organizedBritish Columbia Cervical Cancer Screen-ing Program between 1955 and 1990 pro-duced a 78% decrease in the incidence ofinvasive cancer and a 72% decrease in mor-tality (Matzen and Lang, 1993). T wo similar screening programs in the UnitedStates have shown a 40% and a 50% decline in mortality, respectively. The International Agency for Research in Cancer (IARC) recommends that every woman be given a Pap smear every three years. The Agency estimates that 219 CANCERSWomen over 65 years of age account for nearly half of cervical cancerdeaths. The first priority should be toget every woman screened at leastonce, starting with older women andprogressing to younger ones.51331_p221_246_r1 4/7/03 2:30 PM Page 219this would reduce invasive cervical cancers by up to 90%. Other official agen- cies recommend screening shortly after a woman becomes sexually active, witha second test one year later. After two negative smears, move to a schedule ofonce every three years. Women over 65 years of age account for nearly half ofcervical cancer deaths. The first priority should be to get every woman screenedat least once, starting with older women and progressing to younger ones. Women who have never been screened, over time generate four times the rate of cervical cancers than those coming to screening. There seems to be a positive cor-relation between some life habits and adverse social environments that contributeboth to cervical cancer and failure to participate in screening programs. Sponsorsof screening need to persevere, aware of the reward that the higher percentage oflives saved will occur among the last persons screened. (Also see Chapter 11.) Cancers of the body of the uterus (corpus uteri) also are also relatively common in the United States, but are less frequent elsewhere. They are often calledendometrial cancers, because it is the endometrial lining of the uterus in whichthe carcinoma develops. Mortality from cancer at this site has declined dramat-ically since 1950, and it is not a major public health threat. Its risk factors dif-fer from those for cervical carcinoma. Further information on this cancer can befound in gynecologic textbooks. BREAST CANCER With economic development come rising levels of education, increasing atten-tion to personal hygiene, better sanitary facilities in homes, and greater avail-ability of health services. Greater education gives people a sense of responsibil-ity for themselves\u2014greater ability to make decisions and to do what is necessaryto implement them. These changes in social development, including women'sgreater participation in paid work outside the home, tend to delay the age ofmarriage, reduce the average number of pregnancies, and shorten the durationof breast feeding. And all these raise the risk for developing breast cancer. Breastcancer occurs more often in women of middle to upper socioeconomic status. The risk of getting breast cancer does not correlate highly with the risk of dying from it. And again, socioeconomic development plays the critical role. Womenwith access to, and participation in, early detection have a much greater chanceof surviving breast cancer and returning to a fully active life. Advanced tertiaryinterventions, despite their high costs, have contributed relatively little in thepast to reducing a community's mortality from breast cancer, but early detectionand prompt treatment have. The highest incidence of breast cancer occurs in the United States. White, non- Hispanic women in large California cities have rates that exceed 100 cases per 220 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p221_246_r1 4/7/03 2:30 PM Page 220100,000 population per year. Western Europe and Scandinavia have incidence rates that range between 40 and 90 per 100,000. Developing countries in SouthAmerica report rates of 20 to 40 per 100,000, except for Westernized countriessuch as Uruguay, which has a rate of 93 per 100,000. A striking example of thepower of lifestyle and ethnicity over environment comes from Zimbabwe, wherethe incidence of breast cancer is 128 per 100,000 among residents of Europeandescent, compared to only 20 among those of African ethnicity. Clearly, less de-veloped countries and localities have a much lower incidence of new breast can-cer, although they collectively still experience about 125,000 deaths per year.That is about the same total generated by all developed countries\u2014for a worldtotal of about 250,000 deaths annually (Hansluwka, 1986). On the bright side: some of the risk factors for incidence are known, early detection and treatment can greatly reduce the risks of death per 1,000 cases, and breast examinations and mammography have proven to be effective in manystudies. On the dark side: Breast cancer incidence rates in the United States increased by about 3% per year during the 1980s. While many experts believe this was largely due tomore effective screening outreach, how much was due to a true surge in ma-lignancies is not known. This apparent increase leveled off in the 1990s. Onemight therefore expect that as other nations intensify breast examination andmammography outreach, they too will discover many more cases that requireadvanced diagnosis and treatment services. These services will reduce mortal-ity rates, however. Known risk factors account for only 20% to 30% of the diagnosed breastcancer cases. This means that by far most new cases will continue to be foundin women who have no established risk factors. A \"total population\" approachmay need to be used for screening efforts. The risk factors below can be usedto set priorities for the people with whom to start programs, but not for whento consider stopping. Risk Factors Age. Breast cancer mortality rises sharply with age. One source considers that high risk starts at age 40, another at age 65. Women over 65 years old have four 221 CANCERS51331_p221_246_r1 4/7/03 2:30 PM Page 221times the risk of breast cancer compared to those under 40, with intermediate risk applying to ages 40-64. The gradient of risk with increasing age goes upmoderately in developing countries, but rises sharply in industrialized ones. Personal history. A prior breast cancer or biopsy evidence of atypical hyper- plasia raises the risk. Family history. A close relative having premenopausal or bilateral breast can- cer raises the risk. Early menarche and late menopause compared to local population. Being a Caucasian woman born in North America or Northern Europe.There is some genetic effect, especially for cancers emerging before age 50. Higher socioeconomic status. Never having a completed pregnancy, or late age at first pregnancy. History of ionizing radiation or radiation therapy to the chest or mid-back, especially before age 20. And for some risk factors that are easier to change: Obesity, and possibly excess dietary fat, especially after menopause. Diet too low in vegetables and fruits. Alcohol intake of two or more drinks per day. While research has identified many risk factors, public health planners and cli- nicians must remember that most women who develop breast cancer may shownone of the above risk factors. Protective Factors Avoid drinking alcohol regularly. Maintain appropriate weight, keeping the percent of body weight in fatlow. Avoid unnecessary exposure to X-rays, especially under age 20. Eat vegetables and fruits regularly. A low-fat diet. (The benefits of a low-fat diet are still being debated.) 222 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p221_246_r1 4/7/03 2:30 PM Page 222Secondary Prevention The goal of secondary prevention is to discover a disease early and treat it promptly. This allows for simpler, more effective elimination of the problems be-fore suffering, disability, or death occurs. There are three approaches to screen-ing, at three levels of \"technology.\" The first is the cheapest, but requires themost effort to make it function in a community. Breast self-examination. Breast self-examination (BSE) can be taught to groups of women by a woman health professional. In many places nurses havebecome the experts for such teaching. The teaching goal is for women over age40 to know how to do a proper self-examination and to repeat it every month,one week after the end of their menstrual period, and monthly after meno-pause. Instruction manuals are available in many languages. In places wherebreast self-examination is widely practiced, 70% to 80% of breast cancers arediscovered by the patients themselves. Suspicious small lumps or hard spotsshould be brought to a health professional for further diagnosis. Women cando this knowing that 80% of lumps are not cancerous, and the ones that aredangerous can be removed or treated in ways to make them harmless. Despite public health's years of teaching and reinforcing proper and regular breast self-examination, large scale follow-up studies to date have been unableto document its effectiveness at the community level. Recent breast self-examination training programs based on social cognitive learning modelshave demonstrated positive results lasting six months or more (Clark andBecker, 1996). It will take more trainees and more time to determine whetherthere are positive results in terms of stages at which cancers are discovered. Clinical examination by a trained pro-fessional. This second level of screening should be done each year by a healthprofessional who has had focused train-ing in breast examination. This clinicalexam should detect more subtle changesmissed in the self-exam. This is also an opportunity for the health profes-sional (of any discipline) to check on the woman's techniques for breast self-examination, reteach if needed, and remotivate the patient to continue self-examination faithfully until the next clinical examination. Mammography. The most sensitive method for detecting early breast lesions is the mammogram. The United States Preventive Services Task Force rec-ommends that this radiologic exam be done in all women without symptomsevery one to two years, starting at age 50. Of course, it or a biopsy should beused to make definite diagnoses when breast self-examination or clinical ex-amination are questionable. In large field studies, routine mammography has 223 CANCERSLarge-scale mammographic screening programs should receive a higherpriority in localities where risk ofbreast cancer is high.51331_p221_246_r1 4/7/03 2:30 PM Page 223been shown to lower mortality effectively only in women over age 50. The value of routine mammography in young women without signs or symptomshas not been established (Fletcher et al., 1993). In many parts of the worldmammography is not yet available. Fortunately in most such developing areas,breast cancer risk is relatively low. Large-scale mammographic screening programs should receive a higher pri- ority in localities where risk of breast cancer is high. As with all other pre-ventive expenditures, priorities should be determined based on local burdensof disease, using some measure of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) savedper 100,000 units of currency expended. Despite the costs of mammography, it is one of the few screening tests (along with Pap smears for cervical cancer) that has actually been shown to savemany lives, even after adjusting for biases. It catches malignancies earlier thanother methods, when treatment can be less radical and more successful (Buddand Bhatia, 1993; Thomas, 1986; Schottenfeld and Fraumeni, 1996). PROSTATE CANCER As men's life expectancy increases in most parts of the world, the prevalence ofdiagnosed prostate cancer will continue to rise. Differences in incidence arehuge worldwide, ranging from 0.8 per 100,000 in a screening center in Chinato more than 100 per 100,000 among urban men in the United States. In theUnited States, African-American men have higher rates compared to European-Americans, with Asian-Americans having the lowest incidence of all. Around1990, cancer of the prostate became the most prevalent malignancy in men inthe United States, excluding skin cancers. Men in Australia, Iceland, Scandinavia, and Swit- zerland have incidence rates of 40-60 per 100,000.In Central and South America, prostate cancer isless frequent, except in Westernized industrializedareas. Cancer registries and standardized screeningprograms are few in Central and South America, so estimates are based on mortality figures. Reported rates might be underestimatedby a low index of suspicion for this cancer site among persons completing deathcertificates. Prostate cancer can be called \"the iceberg\" of all malignancies, because such a small fraction of it is ever discovered clinically. Studies in the United States showthat in a large series of male deaths between ages 80 and 89 years, 70% of menshowed evidence of undiscovered prostate cancer at autopsy. Most prostate ma-lignancies begin later in life and progress so slowly that far fewer prevalence 224 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHProstate cancer can be called \"the iceberg\" of all malignancies, because such a small fraction of it is ever discovered clinically.51331_p221_246_r1 4/7/03 2:30 PM Page 224cases die because of that diagnosis, and instead die of other unrelated causes. The few men developing this cancer in their 50s or younger often have a morerapidly growing cell type of malignancy, and the benefit-to-cost ratio for screen-ing and treatment is much more advantageous for these younger men than formen older than 70 or 75 years. The risk factors and causes of prostate cancer remain poorly understood, despite its high frequency. A genetic component is involved, with a man's risk risingsharply according to the number of close relatives who have had the disease. Itis still being debated whether enlargement of the prostate gland that comes withage is an independent risk factor. Several findings point to the likelihood thatandrogens and testosterone might be involved, either in terms of their quantityor in their balance with other hormones. There is some evidence that high di-etary intake of animal fat and red meat may be associated with increased risk,and that regular consumption of vegetables and fruits may reduce risk. Regularphysical activity may also have some protective effect. Nevertheless, publichealth has few clues firm enough to aid primary prevention. Secondary Prevention Men over 50 years old who come in for periodic health examinations will ben-efit from having a digital rectal exam (DRE) by the clinician. This will detectbenign prostatic hypertrophy\u2014enlargement of the gland\u2014and will also revealany lesions on the surface of the prostate gland. Many men, usually in theirolder years, will report the symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy: difficultyin starting and stopping urine flow; increased frequency of urination, especiallyat night; and reduced pressure in the urine flow (dribbling). Prostatic cancer alsocan cause such signs and symptoms, yet may not do so until the lesion is far ad-vanced. All such signs warrant a more thorough search for a malignancy. The United States Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend routine prostatic screening for men without signs or symptoms. The prostate specificantigen (PSA) blood test is fairly sensitive in identifying cancers, but since PSAvalues rise with age and in men with enlarged prostates, the test generates ex-cessive \"false positives.\" Other current screening techniques also tend to gener-ate too many \"false positives.\" This means that many men are told that theymight have cancer\u2014a frightening thought\u2014only to have the disease ruled outlater through more invasive and expensive diagnostic tests. Current screens, es-pecially the DRE, also fail to identify many true cases. In addition, current treat-ment options are difficult or painful, and too often unsuccessful. This section is included to describe the current status of this increasingly preva- lent cancer, and to argue for more research into its etiology, prevention, im-proved screening, and treatment. 225 CANCERS51331_p221_246_r1 4/7/03 2:30 PM Page 22510. Chronic Lung Disorders Each day, the average adult inhales between 10,000 and 20,000 liters of air. Given this huge quantity, even minute amounts of airborne toxins can accumu-late to a serious body burden of damaging substances. Even with air pollution asdilute as one part per million, a sedentary adult will take in about 10 cm 3of con- centrated toxic burden, and a person actively working or exercising will take inabout 20 cm 3. (Some of this may be quickly exhaled or coughed out.) Since the bronchial and lung surfaces adsorb much of the airborne pollutants, the bodyburden builds each day of exposure, accumulating over the years. In the case ofa commonly used class of pesticides, the organophosphates, this could becomedeadly. This section deals with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), emphysema,asthma, respiratory allergies, and otherchronic diseases of the lungs, including tu-berculosis. It does not include acute infec-tions of the upper and lower respiratorytracts, influenza, and pneumonia. Whilethese acute respiratory infections reap theirmortality mostly among infants and chil-dren, chronic lung diseases disable and killmostly older persons, with worldwide deathrates doubling every decade from age 50 to80 years. Chronic lung disorders are the third leading cause of lost years of health\u2014dis- ability adjusted life years (DALYs)\u2014for both women and men over age 60(Murray and Lopez (eds.), 1996, pp. 573-576). On average worldwide, menover 60 years old lose 47 healthy years per 1,000 population annually, whereaswomen these ages lose 31 healthy years per 1,000. Death rates for respiratorycancers in these ages are much higher than for chronic lung diseases, but thelonger duration of the latter accumulate more years of disabled living. CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASES The pathology of chronic obstructive lung diseases involves irreversible loss ofelasticity of lung airway tissue and partial obstruction of large and small air-ways. Subsequently, the walls of the lung air sacs (alveoli) become damaged and 227 CHRONIC LUNG DISORDERS. . . respiratory disease, perhaps more than any other type of disease, can beprevented more easily than cured.Emphysema and all the respiratorycancers (nasal, laryngeal, bronchial,alveolar, and pleural) could all be rareif only society applied the knowledgethat it already has to prevent them. \u2014Sir Richard Doll (1993) Pioneer researcher in the epidemiology of cancer 51331_p247_256_r1 4/7/03 2:31 PM Page 227lose their efficiency in transporting oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lungs and bloodstream. Cigarette smoke especially damages the moist surfaceswhere exchange of these gases takes place. This, in turn, reduces a person's ca-pacity for exercise, increases shortness of breath and the frequency of coughing,and renders breathing difficult, rather than \"being automatic.\" Chronic obstructive lung diseases constitute an accelerated aging of the lungs. The same dysfunctional changes occur gradually over time, such that people 80 years old may show the same symptoms as dosmokers 50 years old. Earlier cases are mostlydue to years of \"bad air\"\u2014in most patients, airpolluted by tobacco smoke, and in others, ex-posure to industrial smoke, irritating fumes,dust from mines, quarries, road-building, cot-ton processing, farming dusts and molds, andmetal smelting and processing. Family differ- ences in lung vulnerability have been occasionally documented, but such influ-ence is small and plays no part in prevention. \"Cure\" is not an option for chronic obstructive lung diseases or emphysema, be- cause the tissue damage is irreversible. Moreover, treatment and rehabilitationare costly and often unsuccessful. Clearly, primary prevention is the cheapestand best option for the community. And primary prevention in this instancemeans \"clean air for all.\" The disease agents for chronic obstructive lung diseases include many kinds of chemical vapors and fumes, and suspended particulates of certain sizes and shapes.Preventive efforts can succeed even when based on a more simplistic model. INDOOR AIR POLLUTION By far the most prevalent indoor air pollutant worldwide is tobacco smoke. Asa result, primary prevention falls along two tracks: reducing the smoke burdenin the air and effectively preventing nonsmokers from having contact with suchpolluted air. Over time, open cooking or heating fires in the home can createserious lung damage if they are not adequately vented to remove smoke andfumes out of the home. Other indoor pollutants occur mostly in the workplace. (The best docu- mented harmful chemicals and dusts are listed in the section \"Occupa-tional Health Hazards\" in Chapter 13.) For example, cotton dusts in pro- cessing plants cause byssinosis, a form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.It has been shown that forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV-1)\u2014ameasure of lung function\u2014can decrease from 5% to 10% in the course of one 228 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH\"Cure\" is not an option for chronic obstructive lung diseases or emphysema. Primary prevention\u2014 \"clean air for all\"\u2014is the cheapest and best option for the community.51331_p247_256_r1 4/7/03 2:31 PM Page 228work shift in a cotton processing plant, although most of this function returns after exposure ceases. Further, the longer one works as a spinner or weaver in atypical cotton textile plant, the higher the prevalence of clinical byssinosis andits associated reduced respiratory function. Studies in developing nations haverecorded byssinosis prevalence ranging from 18% to 30%. Prevalence is muchlower where factories have successfully reduced airborne particles (Mur, 1993,pp. 18-19). Similar chronic, but less lethal, problems have been reported forairborne flour dust in flour milling and commercial baking industries. As withmost pollutants, the risk of disease is directly correlated with the amount ofacute and accumulated body burdens. Isocyanate exposure also has been linked to chronic obstructive pulmonary dis- ease. These chemicals are used in paints, varnishes, and polyurethane foam.Painters in factories or working alone are at higher risk; workmen using spray-painters are at particular risk. Again, smoking tobacco multiplies the lung dam-age these chemicals inflict (Mur, 1993). OUTDOOR AIR POLLUTION Farming also can expose persons to risks for serious lung diseases. Working withgrain, hay, and straw can raise great amounts of dust, and both farmers and grainstorage workers are at risk. In addition, grain, hay, and straw may contain moldand other micro-organisms. These particles can cause acute or chronic lungproblems, including allergic reactions. Some of these lung problems include: Toxic syndrome due to organic dust. Symptoms begin a few hours after ex- posure, and may include coughing, trouble breathing, fever, muscle pains,and headaches. Although symptoms typically last only a few days, repeatedbouts with this syndrome can lead to chronic bronchitis. Farmer's lung. This condition occurs only after repeated exposure to grain,hay, and straw dust. It shows the same symptoms as the above syndrome, last-ing from a few days to a few weeks. After exposure stops, farmer's lung im-proves more rapidly than does toxic syndrome. Chronic obstructive bronchopneumopathies. These conditions are markedby the same symptoms as the two conditions above, plus productive cough(i.e., spitting up phlegm), shortness of breath, and wheezing from the chest(not bronchi). This condition does not go away after exposure ceases, and isassociated with reduced lung function, as measured by forced vital capacityand FEV-1. Other outdoor exposures include polluted air in cities and surrounding popu- lated places. Sites downwind from factories or power generation plants that emit 229 CHRONIC LUNG DISORDERS51331_p247_256_r1 4/7/03 2:31 PM Page 229smoke are particularly dangerous. If prevailing winds blow smoke or fumes to an area, the risk for chronic and acute respiratory disorders increases for peopleliving or working there. Fumes and smoke from motor vehicles carry odorless and colorless\u2014and lethal\u2014 carbon monoxide, as well as smelly, smoky byproducts of combustion, such as fuelvapors and suspended smoke particles. T rucks and buses contribute far more pol-lution per vehicle than do automobiles and motorcycles, but the greater numberof smaller vehicles makes them collectively the greatest source of city air pollution.Auto repair shops become dangerous unless doors and windows are left open, andplaces in which gasoline or diesel motors are running also need to have exhaustfans. Particularly damaging substances are carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, ni- trogen oxides, lead fumes, ozone, polycyclichydrocarbons, and suspended particles of car-bon, carbon ash, and mineral dusts. Millions of people live in cities where vehi- cle fumes cause them to cough acutely oreven to choke on the air. This may well bean unscientific measure, but nature clearly is saying that human health is endangered.Local or regional governments can reducesuch health threats by establishing and en- forcing emission standards on fuel burning motor vehicles. It may be more po-litically feasible to begin by regulating trucks and buses, because of their obvi-ous smoke, and later proceed to regulate automobiles and motorcycles. ASTHMA Asthma afflicts people of all ages. In the past, the clinical focus was on child-hood asthma, but in the last few decades, asthma has become much more preva-lent in older persons in market economies. The reasons for this are unclear, andmay include longer histories of smoke exposure, better treatment that preventsdeath but does not cure the disease, and a higher index of suspicion for this di-agnosis causing it to be made more often. The same causes that create chronicobstructive pulmonary disease are responsible for activating full-blown asthmaattacks and making acute episodes more frequent. Asthma is a disease involving reversible episodes of airway obstruction caused by muscular constriction of the trachea and bronchi. Excessive reactivity of the airpassages is involved along with inflammation. Asthma episodes may be causedby inhaling irritants or may be an allergic reaction, such that both external irri- 230 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHMillions of people live in cities where vehicle fumes cause them to cough acutely or even to choke on the air. Local or regional governments can reduce such health threats by establishing and enforcing emission standards on fuel burning motor vehicles.51331_p247_256_r1 4/7/03 2:31 PM Page 230tants and allergic responses to those irritants may combine to cause symptoms. The usual sequence of asthma development involves initial exposures to airborneirritants, a period of bodily sensitization, and then the development of abnormalairway hyper-reactivity. The primary symptoms are shortness of breath, cough-ing, wheezing from bronchi, tightness in the chest, and fatigue due to the in-creased effort to breathe. Severe acute asthma can cause death if not promptlyand properly treated. Lung function tests done with a simple spirometer aregood field screening methods both for seriousness of asthma and for degree ofchronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Asthma is the most common occupational respiratory disorder in the United States, Canada, and other developed nations. It is increasing rapidly in develop-ing nations, as certain industries increase. About 200 different agents are esti-mated to cause occupational asthma in exposed sensitized persons. The list of spe-cific agents is quite similar to that for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, butalso includes exposure to animals, especially cats, and furry laboratory animals. The economic costs of progressive asthma are considerable, because disability after long exposure to irritants and a long history of symptoms will persist afterexposure stops. Many workers are forced to seek other kinds of work, or requiresome social assistance for partial disability. Prevention Primary prevention includes: Stop tobacco smoking. Remove environmental tobacco smoke left by smokers. Use newer technologies to precipitate industrial air pollutants before theyreach human air space. Screen workers for hypersensitivity to lung irritants and counsel them toavoid jobs where they are exposed to irritants that affect them. Secondary prevention includes performing lung function tests, such as spirom- etry, every year or two (depending on level of exposure). For persons with re-duced lung function, total cessation of tobacco smoking is mandatory and jobreassignment to work in cleaner air is strongly recommended. The respiratorysystem cannot repair itself from chronic damage, and as of now there are nomedications that will heal it. Act accordingly. 231 CHRONIC LUNG DISORDERS51331_p247_256_r1 4/7/03 2:31 PM Page 231FIRST STEPS TO CONTROL ENVIRONMENTAL AIR POLLUTION It would be a daunting task, indeed, to set up a program to measure and cleanse community or worksite air from the dozens of chemicals, dusts, and combus-tion end-products identified here. Nations and provinces would be delayed foryears by pursuing the goal of cleaner air via such an \"itemized\" approach. Fortunately, a quicker, cheaper strategy is available. The United Kingdom since 1956 has focused its clean air programs on smoke control. The effort consistedof measuring the darkness and density of smoke using a standardized chartwhich rates the shades of gray from black to white. Black smoke contains morepollutants and suspended particles than light, gray smoke. The object is to workwith factories and vehicle owners to make their smoke as light and transparentas possible. This simple system was evaluated in a U.K. smoke control area usingair sampling techniques. Tests found that both suspended particulates and sul-phur dioxide were greatly reduced (Samet and Spengler, 1993). This is a goodbeginning to pollution reduction. After this is rigorously implemented, envi-ronmental scientists can determine whether further higher technology programsare needed to deal with invisible gases. A similar system might be developed to measure dust levels. A focused light beam (or several) could be projected across a textile factory, flour mill, quarry,or mine, with a light meter at the other side. The loss of lumens between pro-jector and meter should be directly related to the density of pollution. Another approach to evaluate the need for air cleansing is to have workers wear breathing masks with effective filters, then measure the nature and amount ofpollutants caught by the filters. Will it make a health difference if every workerbreathes properly filtered air? Does use of such filters reduce the loss of lungfunction measured over the course of a work day? SECONDARY PREVENTION OF CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE Secondary prevention involves screening of workers and subpopulations. For persons showing partial airway obstruction or decreased airflow, it is necessaryto intervene aggressively to halt their exposure before they become seriouslydisabled. Respiratory screening usually is done with a hand-held spirometer. This simple, inexpensive device (about US$ 10) measures the total volume exhaled in one sec-ond (FEV-1) and the total volume exhaled in one breath (FVC) when the subjectblows into the spirometer's tube. Spirometers are supplied with disposable papermouthpieces\u2014a new clean one for each user. (The task is forced exhaling only. 232 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p247_256_r1 4/7/03 2:31 PM Page 232To prevent infections, caution subjects against inhaling.) According to T.L. Petty (1993) these two simple indicators are adequate for most screening and clinicalpurposes. Spirometers are to respiratory function what blood pressure instru-ments are to cardiovascular function. Petty urges that they be available and usedregularly in all clinics and medical practices. FEV-1 and FVC should be measuredand recorded annually, especially in occupational settings, so that downwardtrends can be detected and stopped. They are also important for mass screening. Chronic pulmonary diseases have been one of the plagues of the 20th century. There is no need for them to continue in the 21st century. We know how tostop this plague. A young \"clean air generation\" should not gasp for breath, losemobility, and die from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as their grand-parents did. TUBERCULOSIS T uberculosis is covered in this chapter because it is a chronic disease of thelungs. Clinical disease usually first emerges long after the initial infection. Ac-tive cases are usually discovered by tuberculin skin tests, which reveal a historyof infection, or by chest X-ray. T uberculosis occasionally attacks organs of thebody other than the lungs. After treatment the disease can remain dormant inpatients for many years, always with the risk of reactivating into advanced dis-ease and spreading infection to other people. T uberculosis is becoming epidemic again, especially in developing countries. Peo- ple of all ages are susceptible to the infections, but the highest death rates occurbetween ages 30 and 59, accounting for nearly half (46%) of the nearly two mil-lion total tuberculosis deaths each year (Murray and Lopez (eds.), 1996). Whilethe tubercle bacillus is necessary for diagnosing the disease, it is by no means a suf-ficient cause. In some economically advan-taged areas, only 1% or 2% of infected peo-ple (by PPD skin test) become clinically illin the next decade. In some disadvantagedareas more than 50% of infected personsmay become clinically ill. T uberculosis as a cause of disability and death comes to full force in localities with-out adequate sanitation and public healthprograms, where people live in crowded, poor housing with substandard work-ing and living conditions and poor nutrition. Professor George Comstock (inJ.M. Last, 1986) calls tuberculosis \"to some degree a barometer of social wel-fare.\" In industrialized nations, tuberculosis also is increasing again, especiallyamong the poor, the homeless, the poorly nourished, and those with impaired 233 CHRONIC LUNG DISORDERSTuberculosis as a cause of disability and death comes to full force inlocalities without adequate sanitationand public health programs, wherepeople live in crowded, poor housingwith substandard working and livingconditions and poor nutrition.51331_p247_256_r1 4/7/03 2:31 PM Page 233immune systems, such as persons with HIV. About one-third of HIV cases in the world are expected to have tuberculosis listed as their final cause of death. T uberculosis takes a greater toll on men. Because it strikes early in life, with ele- vated death rates from age 15 onward, the disease has a greater economic impacton developing communities than do those chronic diseases whose impact becomesserious only after about age 50. T uberculosis ranked as the sixth leading cause of loss of healthy life-years (DALYs) in the developing world in 1990 (18.5 mil-lion per year for ages 15-59 years). Nearly 40 million healthy years of function-ing were lost for the entire age span. No improvement is projected through 2010. The tuberculosis bacillus is transmitted by airborne droplet nuclei put into the air by actively infected persons who cough, sneeze, or otherwise suddenly exhale.Their sputum also is infective. In areas where cattle are not tuberculin tested anddairy products are not pasteurized, tuberculosis can be passed on to humans. In low-incidence groups, such as middle-class populations in developed areas, most clinical cases of tuberculosis are caused by the reactivation of dormant(latent) encasements of bacilli in the patients' lungs. T uberculosis can be keptfrom spreading by continuing treatment with antibiotics, such as isoniazid, ri-fampin, and in instances of drug resistance, newer antibiotics. Proper dosagesand combinations of antibiotics can make the patient non-infectious usually inone to three months. This also stops progression of the disease in the originalpatient. Dormant, encased pockets of the bacillus can reactivate under stressorssuch as malnutrition, exhaustion, extended exposure to silica dusts, or anotherserious infectious disease. T reatment failure in patients is usually due to an incorrect combination or dosage of antibiotic drugs or to inadequate adherence to the prescribed drugs bypatients. Some treatment centers are using a technique called Directly ObservedT reatment Short Course (DOTS), whereby the patient is directly observed tak-ing each medication dose by a health worker or trusted relative or work super-visor. This speeds the transition of sputum and aerosols to non-infectivity andstops the advance of the disease in the patient. Primary prevention of tuberculosis involves several concurrent actions: teaching everyone, especially infected persons, always to cover their mouths and noseswhile coughing or sneezing, use of aerosol blocking masks by caretakers whenin the presence of persons with uncontrolled coughing or sneezing, hand wash-ing and general cleanliness, finding and testing close contacts of the patient todetermine whether they also are infected, and improving social and living con-ditions for families (Chin, 2000). The overwhelming importance of behavior, social conditions, and environment in the rise, fall, and resurgence of the tuberculosis pandemic has been highlighted 234 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p247_256_r1 4/7/03 2:31 PM Page 234by a United Kingdom study. Around 1848, death certification became adequate enough in geographic spread and reliability to assess annual tuberculosis mortal-ity per 100,000 population in England. The death rate from tuberculosis de-clined without antibiotics by 97% between 1848 and 1948, the year that strep-tomycin, the first antibiotic for tuberculosis, became widely available in England.The use of antibiotics between 1948 and 1971 reduced tuberculosis mortality byonly an additional 1.5% from the 1848 rate (McKeown, 1976). McKeown at-tributed the pre-1948 decline to concerted social action against poverty. T reating tuberculosis with antibiotics is one of the most cost-effective of all pub- lic health interventions, costing only US$ 3 to US$ 7 for each year of disabilityprevented. Given the cost of the disease, starting with two million lives per year,plus uncounted disability, lost production, broken families, etc., a much higherpriority should be given to its prevention. 235 CHRONIC LUNG DISORDERS51331_p247_256_r1 4/7/03 2:31 PM Page 23511. Injuries and Violence This chapter deals with acute damaging events\u2014motor vehicle crashes, falls, in- juries from machinery, drownings, poisonings, gun shots, fires, smoke inhala-tion, lacerations, head trauma, suffocation, and other intentional or uninten-tional traumata. Injuries typically involve a transfer of energy to an organism ina quantity or form that the organism is not prepared to receive. The impact isusually sudden, but also may be subliminal and cumulative, as in repetitivemovement injuries or radon exposure. (Also see the section \"Reducing Rates of Unintentional Injuries\" in Chapter 3.) Worldwide, injuries and violence account for 19% of years of lost health (DALYs) in men and 11% in women of all ages. Hardest hit, however, are menand women 5 to 44 years old. Table 11.1 shows \"externally caused\" deaths as apercentage of total mortality by sex and age. Men's death rates from injuries are double to triple those in women for most specific trauma categories. The total estimated numbers of deaths due to in-tentional and unintentional injuries for all ages were 834,000 in developed re-gions, compared to 4,250,000 in developing areas. (These are estimated deathcounts and do not take population sizes into consideration.) These numbers layto rest the long-held belief that injuries are primarily a problem of the indus-trialized world (Murray and Lopez, 1996). (See also Chapters 12 and 13 for further discussion.) T wo ways of thinking help the pandemic of injuries and violence continue at full throt-tle. These false assumptions are: that such events occur randomly, thatthey are \"accidental\"; that this is \"just the way life is aroundhere\"\u2014that it has always been this wayand the community has learned to ac-cept it. Those false assumptions are easily replaced by the following two scientific axioms, which already have saved many thousands of lives in all regions of theworld: 237 INJURIES AND VIOLENCEThere were an estimated 834,000 deaths due to intentional andunintentional injuries for all ages inthe developed world, compared to4,250,000 in developing areas. Thesenumbers lay to rest the long-heldbelief that injuries are primarily aproblem of the industrialized world.51331_p257_272_r1 4/7/03 2:39 PM Page 237T rauma and injuries are not \"accidents.\" They have causes and risk factors. We may not be able to predict the exact time and persons to be involved inany one injury situation, but some useful truths are known about higher risktimes, places, and persons. For example, intoxicated persons sustain more in-juries than sober ones; the chance of a motorcycle injury becoming fatal is di-rectly proportional to the bike's speed and the rider's lack of helmet; medicinebottles with child-proof closures are less likely to be involved in childhoodpoisonings than open medicine bottles\u2014and the list goes on. Furthermore, many injuries are intentionally caused (see Table 11.1), and, clearly, these are not accidents, either. In many instances, intentional injuriescan be prevented by keeping the aggressor, the weapon, and the victim sepa-rated. (Table 2.1 in Chapter 2 illustrates a broadly applicable epidemi- ologic strategy, using auto injuries as an example. Chapter 7 offerssuggestions for reducing the intensity of intent which lies behind in-tentional injuries.) \"People who do not learn the lessons of the past are forced to re-live it.\" But we have learned that the future need not be like the past, as attested by someof the success stories in the battle against diseases. For example, yellow fever and neonatal tetanus have been eradicated from many places, but this only happened after people believed that they did not have toaccept these diseases as part of their geography or culture. People learned thatthey could help eliminate troubles from their lives\u2014and so they did. 238 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHTABLE 11.1.

About 502,000 deaths wereattributed to war in 1990. This total includes 211,000 men, 141,000 women, and 150,000 children under age15 years. Over half\u201458%\u2014were women and children.51331_p257_272_r1 4/7/03 2:39 PM Page 238The same can be done for many forms of child and adult injury. Health pro- moters can start working to reduce risks, increase protections, and lower dis-ability step-by-step. And, like any journey, it will take time. Dramatic reduc-tions in injuries and traumatic deaths can be achieved in the same ways as theconquests of many diseases: after the systematic population study of risk andprotective factors, and field trials of the efficacy of intervention programs. MOTOR VEHICLE INJURIES Road traffic collisions were estimated to have caused almost one million deathsworldwide in 1990. Counting both years lost to premature death and years lostfrom disabilities, the GBD Study estimates a burden of more than 34 millionyears of healthy life lost (DALYs). Worldwide, motor vehicle accidents are thesingle largest cause of death and disability due to external causes. Nearly half(45%) of these lost DALYs and 40% of these deaths occur among males 15-44years old. Motor vehicle deaths are increasing most rapidly in developing nations. THE CULTURAL HISTORY OF VEHICLE INJURIES Nations follow a natural history in the rate and nature of vehicular injuries. Itgoes something like this. First, motorbikes, trucks, and cars begin to enter theenvironment; then they increase in numbers; then roadways are improved,going from pathways, to roads, to superhighways; then average speeds and thedisparity in speeds increase. The increase in numbers of vehicles per 1,000 km(or miles) of roadways is referred to as a nation's motorization. Early in the process of motorization, the number of injuries relates more closely tothe number of vehicles, rather than to thesize of the population. At this stage, politi-cal decisions must be made and updated toprotect the rights and safety of the unmo-torized majority versus the motorized mi-nority. One example is the paving of \"speedbumps\" on streets where many people live or walk and vehicles go too fast forsafety. Speed bumps can be designed to allow different speeds depending on thelocation. Drivers hate speed bumps, but the lives of many pedestrians and bi-cyclers can be saved. Another example involves cutting parallel grooves a fewcentimeters apart across a concrete roadway. This creates a vibration in cars thatwarns drivers of excess speed or other reasons for caution. As the density of mo-torization rises, limitations on the nonmotorized population increase, as pedes-trians are told to cross the street or road only at marked crosswalks, and bicycle 239 INJURIES AND VIOLENCEWorldwide, motor vehicle accidents are the single largest cause of death and disability due to externalcauses. And motor vehicle deaths areincreasing most rapidly in developingnations.51331_p257_272_r1 4/7/03 2:39 PM Page 239and cart traffic is limited to the outside lane of the right-of-way, or even to spe- cial lanes separated by lines or barriers from lanes used for motor vehicles. Roadway traumata are of two types: injuries to persons inside vehicles and in- juries to persons outside vehicles (nonmotorized). The relative proportion ofthese in a given area depends on the number of moving vehicles . . . sometimes.Early in a nation's motorization, most injuries and fatalities occur to people whoare walking or riding bicycles, to children and others who run out into streetsand roadways, and to people in carts pulled by animals. As more motor vehiclestake to the road the frequency of collision between them rises, and the balanceof injury shifts more to vehicle occupants. There are well proven procedureswhich can safeguard each group (T rianca et al., 1988). The traffic injury epidemic in every nation results from three interacting com- ponents: roadways, vehicles, and roadway users (drivers, bikers, walkers). In thepast, traffic safety programs focused mainly on getting \"bad drivers\" off theroads, but actually, the majority of all crashes involve \"average drivers.\" Hence,traffic safety needs to deal with all three factors. To address each of the three interacting components of traffic injuries, commu- nities should apply the three Es of intervention\u2014Education, Engineering, andEnforcement. For the public, these interventions can be active , when a person must do something to be safe (e.g., keep from driving across the median intooncoming traffic or buckle a seat belt); or passive , when the safety measure is \"built in\" (e.g., concrete barriers separating two traffic directions or roll-overbars built into vehicles). Passive interventions usually are far more effective inpreventing injuries. THE EDUCATIONAL CHALLENGE It often takes a full generation of experience with \"motorization\" (widespreaduse of motor vehicles) for a cultural group to learn to live safely with motorvehicles. The route to safety can be analyzed in terms of four broad stages. First, the community must overcome the fallacious thinking that injuries are \"accidents,\" that they must be accepted rather than prevented (see earlier dis-cussion). Second, there must be intense education of everyone from young children through the elderly\u2014but especially of males prior to ages 15-44\u2014about theproper use of roadways and vehicles and their dangers. Such teaching can takeplace within families and at child-care centers and schools (elementary, second-ary, and technical). Maternal and child health clinics, workplaces, agriculturalagents, the police, and the media all can play important roles. 240 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p257_272_r1 4/7/03 2:39 PM Page 240What is to be taught? Respect, even fear, of motor vehicles. How to cross roads safely. How to walk along roadways (at the edge, facing oncoming traffic). Bicy-cle safety. What should be taught to drivers? Safe driving skills and attitudes. Obedience of the rules of the road. Limitations of speed. Hazards in roadways. Sharp at-tention to the road ahead (many crashes occur just after brief lapses in the dri-ver's attention). Proper care of vehicle, especially brakes, steering, lights, tires.When children are passengers, they shouldsit in the rear seats of cars. When small,they should sit in properly attached safetyseats; when larger, they should use seatbelts. Children should not ride in the backof open trucks because of danger of fallinginto the roadway. Forjuoh and Li (1996) rate the efficacy, affordability, feasibility, and sustain- ability of 19 interventions aimed at reducing transport injuries. Educational in-terventions rank highly on the last three criteria, but do not rank well in termsof efficacy in reducing injuries and deaths. Historically, the introduction of newengineering and better enforcement has proven to be more effective. Local media, such as town and district radio stations and newspapers, can ren- der an important educational service by reporting traumatic deaths and severeinjuries (due to motor vehicles, for example), including the place of crash andname of the victim. Studies of infectious diseases have shown that members ofthe public who know a person with a given disease (a \"case\") are more likely to take preventive action (a vaccine). The same principle should operate fortrauma, and should increase safe behaviors. People one knows mean much,much more than statistics. Third, communities must improve the quality of drivers of vehicles, be they mopeds, autos, farm trucks, or 18-wheel tractor trailers. T raining in operatingskills is the simple part, and often the only part formally taught. Riding as a pas-senger with a careful driver provides a model for how to perform these taskssafely. More important is training in judgment of speeds, distance, times andplaces for overtaking other vehicles, and the likelihood of having persons enter-ing the roadway. Perhaps most important is learning and practicing rules of theroad and driving ethics, as well as exercising emotional control when frustratedor angered. Even persons who are otherwise psychiatrically normal can so iden-tify themselves with the power of a motor vehicle as its driver, that they claimfor themselves a driver's \"divine right,\" ignoring the rights of all others. Aggres-sive driving, in men or women, creates the same dangers. Psychologically speak-ing, being in a vehicle permits expression of aggression from within a cloak ofanonymity (Professor B.J. Campbell, personal communication). Drivers must 241 INJURIES AND VIOLENCEMaternal and child health clinics, workplaces, agricultural agents, thepolice, and the media all can playcritical roles in teaching roadway and vehicle safety.51331_p257_272_r1 4/7/03 2:39 PM Page 241accept that their rightful goal is not to subdue or defeat all other vehicles, only to pass through traffic safely. A culture tends to learn driver ethics through 20to 30 years of painful experience. Can proper teaching and role modeling makethis learning happen faster? Fourth, pedestrians also need training, especially in localities where motor ve- hicle traffic has traditionally been light. Everyone needs to keep children fromrunning out into roadways, and to make sure that children keep their wagons,tricycles, and other wheeled toys from carrying them into danger. (Also see text on reducing rates of unintentional injuries in the section \"FromBirth Through Age 4 Years\" and in \"Screening Checklist from Ages 5through 14 years in Chapter 3.) Pedestrian mortality rates in the United States are relatively constant across age decades until age 70, when deaths in-crease greatly. In the United States 40% of adult pedestrians killed have highblood alcohol levels. People who have been drinking should not walk near traf- fic. A sober person should accompany them to asafe place to recover. Always, walk on sidewalks oron the side of the road facing oncoming traffic.When walking at dusk or in darkness, always wearlight colored reflective clothing. When bicycling,wear light-colored clothing and equip the bikewith reflective tape or reflectors. In the rain wearbright yellow (not dark) raincoats. THE ENGINEERING CHALLENGE The greatest responsibility for containing\u2014or \"channeling\u2014the threat of motorvehicles rests with the community. It is the community that builds, repairs(sometimes), and polices the roadways. Proper street and road engineering is thefirst step. This engineering has developed into an advanced science. Some of itsnewer techniques are low tech and inexpensive. It is better to build safely fromthe beginning, rather than to bequeath a blood-hungry infrastructure to futuregenerations. When planning a new road, it is best to set aside a wide right-of-way, perhaps two to three times wider than the initial roadway. Most roads be-tween busy cities need to be widened every 10 years because of increased traffic.This advance planning for space will save much money in the long run. Manyexpert consultative resources are available at little or no cost from ministries oftransportation and international organizations such as WHO, PAHO, and theother Regional Offices. Road features that limit speed are valuable\u2014speed bumps, turns in the road, an unrepaired surface, all do quite well. Deep holes or ridges in the road surface areharmful, however, because they damage steering mechanisms and may causecars to swerve and cycles to overturn. Another warning device called speed strips 242 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHA prescription for anyone walking in or near traffic: Remain alert, no daydreaming, no distractions like headphones. Walk defensively. You are responsible for your own safety and survival.51331_p257_272_r1 4/7/03 2:39 PM Page 242or rumble strips consists of strips or bands of rough or serrated pavement which create noise and vibration when crossed at too rapid a speed. This can be awarning that a stop sign is ahead or that the vehicle is going off the drivinglanes, either to the left or right. Proper installation of warning signs and stopsigns, painting lane lines on pavements, and creating turn lanes where trafficpatterns require them cost little; their savings in human and property damageare comparatively greater. Head-on collisions\u2014the impact of vehicles movingtoward each other\u2014are particularly lethal. Such crashes can be largely preventedby separating opposite traffic directions with barriers, fences, or wide spatialseparation (e.g., dual-lane highways). In cities where speeds are less, similar ben-efits may result from one-way streets. Other proven safety measures in roadway construction include: Make road curves of large radius, rather than small, and bank curves to re- duce frequency of vehicles leaving the road. Make road shoulders hardened or paved. Use surfacing materials that provide good adhesion to vehicle tires to reduceskidding, especially in wet weather. Shield bridge abutments and immovable barriers with collapsible \"bumpers\"that reduce crash impact. A variety of bendable rails and plasticized barrels areproduced for this purpose. Move poles for power and light well off the shoulders, and remove treeswhich might make an impact fatal. A systematic life-saving program for towns and cities is to maintain records of locations of vehicular collisions causing deaths or disability. This includes in-juries to people who are on foot or riding bicycles. Keeping track of minor col-lisions (\"fender benders\") may require much work, but they tend to correlatehighly with places and times where major losses occur. One or two impacts orcollisions might occur anywhere, but when a \"spot map\" shows larger clustersof incidents, helpful interventions can be made, often cheaply. Vehicle engineering plays a major role in transport safety. The typical incident involves two crashes: first, the vehicle either hits an \"outside\" object (such as an-other vehicle, a post, barrier, wall, or a pedestrian) or it runs off the road; andsecond, the initial impact throws persons inside the vehicle against the dash-board, steering column, window glass, inner roof, or doors. Doors may swingopen, and riders may be ejected outside onto unforgiving surfaces, depending onthe speed of the vehicle on impact. 243 INJURIES AND VIOLENCE51331_p257_272_r1 4/7/03 2:39 PM Page 243The exterior of the auto or truck can be designed and built to absorb as much shock as possible, thus reducing the crash acceleration of passengers inside. Sim-ilarly, the interior design can contribute to safety by cushioning the dashboard,steering wheel, and backs of front seats; constructing the steering column so thatit slowly collapses on impact; installing crash-resistant door locks; and, most im-portant of all, installing three-point safety seat belts that restrain both the shoul-der and the waist. Such safety belts protect front-seat riders from crashing theirheads on the windshield, and also prevent ejection out of the car, which too oftenhas fatal consequences. Properly installed air-bags for riders in the front seats alsoadd to safety, but only when the three-point seat belt is also worn at the sametime. Seat belts are much cheaper than air-bags and far more effective as well. In addition, new engineering changes are seeking to make vehicle exteriors less damaging to cyclists and walkers, by reducing protrusions on the front and sidesof the vehicles and shaping the front to deflect the object struck to reducefrontal impact and move the object (or person) away from the wheels (T rinca et al., 1988). THE ENFORCEMENT CHALLENGE Early in a nation's transition to motorization, it is essential for that country todevelop, publicize, and teach its population a comprehensive, clearly definedsystem of laws relating to traffic behaviors of drivers, passengers, bicyclists, andpedestrians. Enforcing such traffic regulations is an essential community function, which will have substantial effects in terms of lives saved. Consistent enforcement withlocally appropriate penalties works on the principle of behavior modification bypenalizing violations. Even though perhaps only a small percentage of suchviolations are initially punished, the effect on the total numbers of such behav-iors will be substantial. Social learning principles will spread the effect to non-penalized persons, tending to change their behavior. Important Infractions from a Safety Viewpoint Excessive speed for the section of roadway involved. Higher speeds reduce the chance to avoid collision. They increase the distance it takes to stop. Theymake accurate steering more difficult. They increase the chance that an impactwill be fatal both to those outside and inside the vehicle. Consider that twovehicles approaching one another, each at a speed of only 80 km/h (50 mph),collide with an impact equal to one car crashing into a concrete wall at 160km/h (100 mph). Head-on collisions at such speed assure the destruction ofboth vehicles\u2014and usually of the persons within. 244 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p257_272_r1 4/7/03 2:39 PM Page 244Carelessness, risk taking, distraction, and attention lapses. Stop and change drivers when the current driver feels inattentive, road weary, or emo-tionally upset. Where possible, it is wise to rotate drivers every few hours be-fore fatigue sets in. Impairment of drivers by alcohol or drugs. This creates the highest risk of impact, crippling injury, and death. Severe penalties such as revocation ofdriving privileges or time spent in jail are appropriate. The legal definition of intoxication (and penalties) is a blood alcohol level of only 0.08% to0.10% in most English-speaking nations. While other countries may havedifferent standards, most places have definitions based on observable behav-ior, such as slurred speech, unsteady gait, odor of breath, slowed reflexes, orimpaired thinking. Intoxicated driving is not that frequent in total popula-tions, but because of its virulence, must be eliminated. Scandinavian nationshave taken the lead in building zero-tolerance of impaired driving into theirlaws and culture (Evans, 1991, especially Chapters 7 and 8). Social pressure and peer group helpfulness are far more effective than the law in keeping people who have been drinking alcohol from driving a vehicle.Media campaigns with the slogan \"Friends don't let friends drive drunk\" ap-pear to be effective. Even persons not obviously intoxicated often have theirsenses, coordination, and judgment impaired just enough for a crash to hap-pen. A group going to a party or event where alcohol will be served often ap-points a \"designated driver,\" who on that occasion will abstain from all alco-hol and drive the group home safely. Usinga taxicab or obtaining a ride from a fullysober person are other ways to avoid \"drink-ing and driving\" a motor vehicle. Even partlyintoxicated persons walking along a road-way are at great danger because of their inat-tention and erratic walking pattern. In places where traffic laws are new, largely ignored, or scoffed at, enforcement has a trauma-strewn road ahead of it. There are three specific antidotes to thisproblem: Establish the laws early in the area's movement into motorization and createa recognition of their practical value in the population. Teach schoolchildren and youth the rules of the road. Phase in enforcement by punishing the more serious infractions first, such asdriving while under the influence of alcohol, reckless driving, speeding morethan 30 km/h (or 20 mph) over the posted speed limit, and failure to stop atdesignated sign posts. 245 INJURIES AND VIOLENCEYoung drivers everywhere are involved in more crashes than olderdrivers. Delaying the eligible age foracquiring a driver's license will frequency.51331_p257_272_r1 4/7/03 2:39 PM Page 245This kind of phase-in of enforcement has not been adequately evaluated in the field, but has the theoretic advantage of \"making real\" the fact of enforcement.First, it requires only a few arrests to spread the news widely. Second, it does notoverwhelm traffic police and magistrates with large numbers of prosecutions.Third, a few arrests for obviously dangerous behaviors are less likely to create acommunity \"backlash\" of anger against authorities than many arrests suddenly. After this level of enforcement becomes accepted as routine, traffic officials can begin enforcing less extreme violations, particularly if they result in a crash.Throughout each stage of the process, consistency of enforcement is essential. Later, officers also can begin issuing warning citations to persons with other in-fractions, such as making illegal turns and driving a vehicle lacking required safetyequipment, such as burned out lights, ineffective brakes, or cracked windshields. In some nations with a long history of motorization, new laws requiring seat belt use by everyone riding in the front seats of cars or trucks were phased infirst by passing the law and providing public education, then by a month or twoof \"warning tickets\" (citations), followed by comprehensive enforcement withmonetary fines. For defective equipment violations, after the \"learning period,\"enforcement consisted of issuing an arrest citation that the car owner couldeliminate by coming to the police station within five days and showing a trafficofficer that the equipment problem had been repaired. CROSS-CUTTING INITIATIVES Other strategies for reducing vehicle injuries involve decreasing the number ofindividual vehicles on the road. Improving public transport systems in cities\u2014bus or rail\u2014and giving residents incentives for using them can be a valuablestrategy. Bus and rail travel is not only safer per million passenger miles, it alsoreduces air pollution and traffic congestion in cities. Singapore, home to farmore vehicles than city streets and boulevards could hold safely, pioneered re-stricting the use of private autos to alternate days, based on the last digit of thelicense number. Other cities provide remote parking and low cost commuter railto the city. France has used a different tactic: taxing vehicles according to enginesize. Since high speeds require large, high-powered engines, faster cars get taxedmore. The result: fewer high-speed cars on the road. Restrictions on drivers also have proven valuable. Young drivers everywhere are involved in more crashes than older drivers. If persons must be licensed beforebeing allowed to drive (and violations are firmly penalized), delaying the eligi-ble age for receiving a driver's license will cut crash frequency. Some states in theU.S.A. now have a stepped licensing program: 16-year-olds are eligible to re-ceive a license after passing tests, but they can only drive an automobile if ac- 246 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p257_272_r1 4/7/03 2:39 PM Page 246companied by an older licensed driver and can only drive during the day. Driv- ing privileges are then incrementally expanded each six to twelve months. Otherstates only permit teenage drivers to carry one other teenager as passenger, be-cause having several teenagers in one car has been found to create an especiallyhigh risk. National, state, and provincial governments can help communities to reduce traffic deaths by introducing the vehicle equipment standards detailed below.After a run-in period sufficient for the early majority to obtain the recom-mended equipment, these standards can be required by law. (Also see the sec- tion \"Diffusion of Innovation\" in Chapter 12.) Motorcycles and their riders incur far more crashes per 100,000 km than do passengers in four-wheeled vehicles. Therefore, governments should encour-age, and later require, drivers and passengers of any two-wheeled motor vehi-cle capable of going more than 50 km/h (30 mph) to wear safety helmetswhile riding. Helmets should be able to withstand impacts at the above speedwithout cracking open. The most frequent cause of death and most costlyform of injury while riding motorcycles is head trauma with permanent braindamage. Helmets reduce the risk of fatality by about 28% in serious crashes.The most effective way to increase helmet use is to require wearing helmets bylaw, and enforcing it (Evans, 1991). Require all locally produced or imported cars or trucks to have safety belts installed,especially in front seats. In the UnitedStates, all but one state requires front-seatoccupants to use seat belts. Three-point,harness type seat belts that restrain bothshoulder and waist protect against the \"sec-ond collision\"\u2014when the body hits the carinterior after the car has hit an outside barrier or moving car. Shoulder beltsprotect the face and head. Restraints also keep the person inside the car. Ejec-tions from the vehicle during severe impacts are very often fatal. Combinedlap/shoulder belts reduce risk of fatalities to front-seat riders by about 40%,with half of this effect (based on United States national statistics) comingfrom preventing driver or passengers from being ejected from the vehicle(Evans, 1991, p. 247). Smaller children require safety seats having their own restraints and being latched to seat belt anchors, preferably in rear seats. In the United States, all50 states require that children be restrained in child safety seats or safety belts,depending on their size, or they must ride in the back seats. In a collision, anunrestrained child becomes a missile launched against vehicle windows, struts, 247 INJURIES AND VIOLENCETraffic safety strategies that have worked in highly motorized nationsmay not be transplanted successfullywithout major modifications. Provenprinciples work, but not necessarily the details.51331_p257_272_r1 4/7/03 2:39 PM Page 247and metal\u2014often fatally. Areas mandating child safety measures quickly learn their value in lives saved. In developing areas many people ride in the backs of open trucks or cling tothe sides of buses. Open trucks require protective railings, so standing pas-sengers do not fall out at bumps or turns. T rucks and buses also should havesturdily mounted grab bars to assist people entering and leaving vehicles. The problems associated with establishing and advancing traffic safety pro- grams in developing nations are complex. Strategies that have worked in highlymotorized nations may not be transplanted successfully without major modifi-cations. It should be kept in mind that proven principles work, but not neces-sarily the details. More recently motorized areas need not reinvent the wheel,however. That would take unnecessary time and unnecessarily lose lives. Theideal is for the developing nation to face its problem early by constituting apanel of advisors combining international and national traffic safety experts,and work out cooperatively a year-by-year plan. The process is thoughtfully and critically described in the 1998 volume edited by the Global T raffic SafetyT rust. CARBON MONOXIDE IN VEHICLES Carbon monoxide (CO), an odorless, colorless gas, is the leading cause of fatalpoisoning in the United States and is similarly serious elsewhere. Carbon mon-oxide occurs wherever fuels burn. CO poisoning of drivers, passengers, and autorepairmen is always a threat wherever motors are running in an enclosed spacewithout sufficient free flow of outside air. Exhaust systems must be regularlychecked for leaks, especially in buses or trucks where people ride in the rear. Ofcourse, children are damaged by lower concentrations of CO than adults. Early symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are drowsiness, dizziness, head- ache, or nausea. Anyone experiencing any of these common symptoms, shouldbe questioned to eliminate CO exposure. Children arriving at school with thesesymptoms should have their buses checked. If repairs cannot be done the sameday, bus windows should be kept open until the problem is fixed. T ruck driverswith these symptoms should keep windows open. LOOKING AHEAD Although the overall numbers of injuries may rise in a province or state as thenumbers of vehicles increase, the future still looks more encouraging over time.The cultural changes of a motorizing society tend to reduce the burden of 248 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p257_272_r1 4/7/03 2:39 PM Page 248motor vehicle trauma in terms of hundreds of millions of vehicle miles driven. That means that nations become safer over time per unit of travel completed.In the United States between the 1920s and the 1990s, the motor vehicle deathrate decreased from about 15 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles to about 2.This suggests that any nation committing itself to highway safety can achievesimilar proportional reductions. This can be accomplished in fewer decades,now that research has identified which are the most successful initiatives. SUICIDE AND VIOLENCE Worldwide, there were 786,000 deaths recorded as due to suicide and 563,000 due to violence (homicide) in 1990. According to the Global Burden of DiseaseStudy, an additional 502,000 deaths were attributed to wars (see Table 11.1 fora breakdown of intentional and unintentional deaths). These worldwide figuresmask the vast differences that exist in these rates across countries. Given suchdifferences, each country must develop programs tailored to its own circum-stances. (The sources consulted for this section were Bennets, 1993; and Mur-ray and Lopez, 1996.) Why anger emerges, how intense it is, and how it is expressed are tied to a per- son's cultural and ideological background. Interestingly, countries that have thehighest suicide rates tend to have low homi-cide rates, and the reverse is true elsewhere.The same distinction between suicide-pre-dominant versus homicide-predominantareas is observed among the 50 states of theUnited States. The social acceptability or de-gree of disdain toward suicide or homicidenot only influences those persons who con-sider perpetrating the act, but also the validity of reporting. In most nations anunknown fraction of suicides and homicides are recorded as accidental deaths. The highest suicide rates among men occur in the former socialist economies, particularly among men aged 30-59 years old. Countries with the highest sui-cide rates in men are Hungary, Finland, China, and Japan. Established marketeconomies, China, India, and other parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands follow.In most regions, the suicide rate increases with age, with China experiencing anannual rate of 104 per 100,000 for men over age 60. The picture is very different for women, with suicide being infrequent, except for China, which has the highest rates, especially among young women 15-29years old (44 per 100,000 in this age group). This compares to 23 per 100,000in India, and 4 in the established market economies for women in the same 249 INJURIES AND VIOLENCEWorldwide there were 786,000 deaths recorded as due to suicide and 563,000due to violence in 1990, but thesefigures mask the vast differences thatexist from country to country.51331_p257_272_r1 4/7/03 2:39 PM Page 249ages. The highest suicide rate for women is 92 per 100,000 for women older than 60 years old in China. Suicide is extremely rare among women in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and the former socialist nations. The cost of suicide goes far beyond years of life lost. While worldwide data are unavailable, many industrialized nations find that only about 5% to 15% of suicide attempts are fatal. The remaining 90% or so attempts incur manymillions of dollars in medical expenses, and about 5% suffer permanent dis-abilities. Suicide rates have risen sharply the world over in the last 30 years, evenaffecting adolescents. However, suicide is still most frequent in the oldest ages.According to the GBD Study, suicide rates will continue to rise until at least2020. The ecology of homicide differs greatly from that of suicide. Highest worldwide risks are among men in Sub-Saharan Africa (176,000 deaths in 1990), wherehomicides outnumber suicides by 13 to 1. Latin American and Caribbean menhave the second highest risk of violent death, at 89,000 such deaths in 1990 anda 5.6 to 1 ratio of homicide to suicide. In Africa, women die of assaultive violence10 times as often as by suicide. These ratios are high because the number of sui-cides is extremely low. Men aged 15-44 years old are at highest risk for violentdeath worldwide, while women of all ages are relatively spared from homicide. The challenge of reducing intentional deaths should consider primary and sec- ondary prevention of aggressive conduct disorders. (Also see discussion in Chapter 7.) At the population level\u2014the foundation on which cultural and health changes are built\u2014the \"culture of violence\" must be systematically dis-mantled and replaced with tolerance. War is a health plague built on violence. In 1990 alone, wars were estimated to have caused502,000 deaths (see footnote in Table 11.1). Al-though there were no world wars or major inter-national conflagrations during that year, therewere local conflicts in Africa and the Middle East.And yet, those 502,000 deaths in 1990 weremore than deaths from site-specific cancers (ex- cept for lung and stomach), all the inflammatory heart diseases, or HIV/AIDS.Moreover, once permanent disabilities were added to the deaths, wars in 1990accounted for 20 million lost years of health. And that continues year afteryear\u2014a horrific epidemic, indeed. War has been defined as, \"Old men seeking power or revenge sending their young men out to kill, and be killed by, other young men.\" The GBD Study'saccounting of war deaths belies this view. The 1990 tally was 211,000 men, 250 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHIt is at the population level\u2014the foundation on which cultural and health changes are built\u2014where the \"culture of violence\" must be systematically dismantled and replaced with tolerance.51331_p257_272_r1 4/7/03 2:39 PM Page 250141,000 women, and 150,000 children under age 15 years. Clearly, women and children together die far more frequently than men by a ratio of 58% to 42%. Risk Factors Data show that suicides outnumber other intentionally inflicted deaths by a 40% margin worldwide. Countries and areas within countries where suicide is ahealth and social problem, will find the discussion of depressive disorder useful,because that is the prime risk factor for self-inflicted injury. (Also see the sec- tion \"Neuropsychiatric Disability\" in Chapter 7.) Other factors that may pre- cipitate suicide are (1) experiencing humiliation or defeat, (2) feeling trapped ina situation the person can neither overcome nor escape, and (3) believing thatno close caring person is available who is able and willing to really help. (Also see relevant text in \"Major Problems at Ages 15-24\" in Chapter 4.) The worldwide annual tally of suicides and homicides is huge\u20141.8 million in 1990. Nevertheless, small average cities of 100,000 residents might experienceonly about 15 suicides and 11 homicides in a given year. When incidents are sorare, it is difficult to predict them without labeling too many false positives\u2014citizens who are categorized as \"high risk,\" but who have no bad outcomes.With this caution held aloft, here are some of the \"signs of risk\" for suicide: 1. The strongest single predictor is a prior suicide attempt. Anyone who at- tempts suicide needs serious help, which should continue until the crisis isresolved. 2. Major depression confers an 18-fold lifetime risk over that of the popula- tion without any mental disorder. 3. Bipolar disorder confers 24-fold risk.4. Chronic dysthymia\u2014feeling sad and troubled for years\u2014confers a 17-fold risk. 5. Persons who are currently depressed (suffering from any of the above three conditions), may have a 30-fold increased risk, according to one study(Guze and Robins, 1970). 6. Having overpowering feelings of being alone in the world, such as may occur after an acute life crisis. 7. A history of impulsive, damaging behavior.8. A family history of suicide (gives patient a role-model). 251 INJURIES AND VIOLENCE51331_p257_272_r1 4/7/03 2:39 PM Page 2519. A terminal illness or a disfigurement. 10. Belonging to a socially-alienated, stigmatized group. 11. Being hospitalized for alcoholism (70-fold risk), AIDS (36-fold risk), or renal dialysis (10- to 50-fold risk). 12. Availability of a lethal means of death: guns, poison, large quantities of a potentially lethal prescribed medication. Each culture has its own methods. Family members, teachers, and health workers dealing with individuals or groups in which suicide risk factors are elevated should take into account the \"naturallife history\" of this cause of death. The stages are as follows: 1. Thinking about death, dying, or reuniting with close persons who are dead.2. Talking with others about hurting him- or herself and feelings of useless- ness, failure, badness, abandonment, hopelessness, helplessness. 3. Making veiled or open threats of suicide.4. Preparing for death: giving away favorite possessions, giving \"final\" advice, finishing up unfinished tasks (in the context of other signs). Using variousindirect means of saying goodbye. 5. Making suicide plans: this is usually discovered only by asking, perhaps using several different approaches. 6. Attempting suicide; this is always a drastic step that needs treatment.7. Completing the effort by another attempt. Knowing the above sequence enables teachers, social workers, or health care providers to observe and inquire\u2014and to help families look for and ask\u2014forthese signs and to intervene as early in the sequence as possible. Positive find-ings are a signal to obtain immediate help to halt and reverse the psycho-behavioral process.

Principles and Methods of Behavior Change ETHICAL AND STRATEGIC PRINCIPLES The main barriers to a community's health\u2014no matter where it is in the world\u2014are neither physical nor biological. Neither an unreliable water supply,living in crowded, substandard housing conditions, the presence of infectiousagents or disease vectors, nor malnourishment are the most powerful hindrancesto better health. Rather, the primary obstacles to improving a community'shealth are cultural, social, and interpersonal expectations and behaviors. Cul-tural expectations determine the priorities that social power structures allot toclean water supplies and raising housing standards. The values placed on aver-age people\u2014especially on children\u2014shape how social groups and individualsinteract with each other and what preventive health and educational services aremade freely available to all. Great scientific breakthroughs do not automatically \"break through\" to benefit the community. Many advances in environmental and health sciences have notyet been adequately put into practice. Witness the choking air pollution in manyof the world's most rapidly growing cities,the famines due to food distribution fail-ures rather than food scarcity, the continu-ing rapid spread of AIDS despite wide-spread knowledge about how to prevent thedisease's transmission. In every one of thesecases, science has at least a partial solution,but the will\u2014or the skill\u2014to change collective and personal behavior is missing.In short, every widespread human disease or health disorder owes it prevalence,at least to some degree, to social and behavioral processes. These processes maybe involved in its causes, its transmission, or its treatment\u2014and, hence, in itsprevention. Because every individual or group behavior is learned, it has the potential to be modified or replaced with other, newly learned behaviors. Learning principlesalso underline cultural changes. Every culture has changed faster in the 20thcentury than ever before. And the 21st century promises to bring even morerapid innovations, as satellites and the Internet instantly transmit ideas, images,and information across class, cultural, and political boundaries. 255 PRINCIPLES AND METHODS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGEBecause every individual or group behavior is learned, it has the potentialto be modified or replaced with other,newly learned behaviors. 51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 255Persons, groups, and entire societies become exposed to alternative ways of doing things. If these new ways are seen as easier, less costly, or if they lead tomore rewarding outcomes, persons and groups are likely to adopt the new ap-proaches at the next opportunity. Each time people believe that a new behavioris less trouble and/or more rewarding than a former one, the new approach isstrengthened\u2014reinforced\u2014until it becomes a habit. Culture is defined as the total network of customs, beliefs, priorities and values, technology, social roles and behaviors, kinship, authority, and habits shared bypeople living together. Culture functions as an integrated system: if one part ischanged, other parts alter themselves to fit that change. Society is the term for the content and structuring of interactions among the people involved. When considering implementing a program designed to change behavior in in- dividuals or groups, certain ethical questions come to the fore. For example, isit ethical and proper for health professionals to enter into an area with peopleof a different culture and try to change ways of living that the local group haspracticed\u2014and survived with\u2014for many generations? Or, is it ethical\u2014andjustified\u2014for local health workers to press individuals to change behaviors thatare harmful to their own health but not harmful to anyone else? Shouldn't peo-ple still be free to do what they want? In fact, it is the highest of ethics to set before groups and individuals the op- portunity to make those choices that will better their health, their resources forhappiness and productivity, and their futures. This might best be done by di-rectly involving the various subcommunities in the area of the proposed inter- vention in the needs assessment, decision-making,program planning and implementation, as well asits evaluation and follow-up. The key to introducing ethical and effective health changes depends on having health professionals,be they local or foreign, work cooperatively withlocal groups and individuals to provide informed choices. There are commercial, political, religious, and other groups locally ac-tive already trying to change residents' values and behaviors\u2014sometimes for self-ish reasons that may not advance the good of the community. In addition, vari-ous social, economic, or environmental trends also may be pushing their waythrough the community's thinking and lifestyle. Improving the entire commu-nity's health by working to change individuals, communities, or societies can beethical and salutary, if the following five principles are kept in the forefront: involve the community, value people and their culture, 256 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHThe key to introducing ethical and effective changes depends on having health professionals work co-operatively with local groups and individuals.51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 256offer choices, develop informed consent, and keep the purpose, actions, and planned outcomes open to everyone that will be affected, including local citizens, their opinion leaders, health officials, andprofessionals. The world seems to have shrunk to become a global village. A cholera outbreak in one community can spread to many nations, and winds can carry nuclearfallout to every corner of the world. The deadly Ebola virus and novel strains ofinfluenza now jet from country to country, rapidly spreading disease across in-ternational boundaries. And, irresponsible, unprotected sex spreads HIV, break-ing up families, leaving orphans, and taking a tremendous toll on communities.T raditional local solutions\u2014or non-solutions\u2014to health crises may prove inad-equate for coping with these global problems. They may need to be replaced bynewer scientific solutions, solutions that depend on changing societal and per-sonal behaviors. MOBILIZING THE COMMUNITY As health research continues to discover more pathways to disease preventionand health promotion, it becomes clearer that health workers alone cannot ac-complish all the work ahead (Rojas Aleta, 1984, p. 3). In addition, worldwidepopulation growth and spreading poverty make the task formidable. The world's population continues to expand, migrations and wars cause in- creasing family dislocation, shantytowns in and around cities multiply and arereservoirs of disease and social pathology, and a million communities need purewater and waste disposal. Hundreds of millions of people have mental healthproblems; three or four billion need to change to healthier lifestyles. In short,throughout the world profound changes in societies, cultures, and ways of liv-ing are imperative if we truly are to achieve \"health for all.\" The World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund jointly organized and sponsored the 1978 landmark International Conferenceon Primary Health Care, held in Alma Ata in the then USSR. Delegations from134 governments and representatives of 67 United Nations organizations, spe-cialized agencies, and nongovernmental organizations gathered there to affirmthe key role of primary health care in reaching the goal of \"health for all.\" Theyurged the health sector to cooperate with other public sectors (agriculture andindustrial development, education, economics, transport, communication, andlabor) to accomplish shared health goals. The vital thrust of the report was that 257 PRINCIPLES AND METHODS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 257generating the community's participation was critical to successfully having the entire community adopt healthier ways and sustain them even after outsideproject workers had gone home. To make this happen, agencies from outside the district or nation must channel their energies on training local persons in community participation and grouporganizing (in addition to health service skills), so that both technical knowl-edge and community momentum can be sustained. This process already hasproven successful in the Caribbean for training national health educators tospread their outreach and generate budget support for program continuity. Community participation was seen in the 1970s as the magic vehicle that would carry the developing world toward the goals of \"health for all.\" Efforts to putthis approach into practice have been carried out in many localities and bymany cultural and political systems. With each effort, the meaning and impli-cations of \"community have broadened, as have theother labels given to this general philosophical approach. The result is a com-plex concept, not usually clearly defined and hence difficult to evaluate in termsof its inputs, processes, and outputs (Morgan, 1993). After 25 years, the concept of achieving health for all through community par- ticipation and intersectoral cooperation remains almost universally acceptedideologically, although its application has been more debated and has generatedmore conflict (Morgan, 1993; Stebbins, 1997). There has even been debateabout whether community participation generates better health outcomes thandoes standard health services delivered by the government. In 1985, ProfessorA. Ugalde wrote that, promotional efforts by international agencies notwith-standing, at that time there were no success stories proving that community par-ticipation had incrementally improved outcomes in Latin American health pro-grams (Ugalde, 1985). Either way, those committed to the concept argue, largely on philosophical and political grounds, that community involvement is valuable in its own right, ir-respective of health outcomes. They add that the process of sharing mutual con-cerns and developing internal leadership will assist in later community develop-ment efforts. A 1998 literature search conducted for this Handbook identified many hun- dreds of publications referring to community or consumer participation. Thelatest reviews of this literature in scientific journals and books dwell on theproblems of conceptualizing and implementing research and evaluation, ratherthan on the health results of controlled studies. Ideological consensus does notprove that community participation delivers measurably better health out-comes, however (see also Morgan, 1993; Ugalde, 1985; Rifkin, 1990). Nor does 258 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 258a lack of rigorous data prove that the community involvement approach has no incremental values beyond the traditional provision of health services. Instead,the fundamental questions\u2014as yet unanswered\u2014are more along the order ofthe following: In what social environments and among what cultural and edu-cational groups do specific community involvement programs result in changesin pre-defined group health conditions? Full discussion of the theory and practice of \"community participation\" is be- yond the scope of this Handbook. The consensus inferred from the 1998 liter-ature review, however, is that the planning of any specific local program musttake, as a minimum, all of the following factors into consideration: the current level of community development, the community's educational levels, cultural practices, openness to new ideas, the economic situation, the past history of political or decision-making involvement by all the com-munity's subpopulations. The array of published materials reviewed about community involvement came from left, center, and right of the political spectrum, and from a variety of aca-demic disciplines and field workers. Nevertheless, there seemed to be broadagreement on some principles and concerns. We list below a series of brief state-ments that reflect recurrent themes in the literature, which are supported bypsychological and sociological research on related issues. It is more effective to do things with people rather than for people. Where at all possible, the public should participate actively at all four stages of a health project: situation diagnosis and problem identification, decisionmaking and program formulation, implementation, and monitoring andevaluation. Community participation is not a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach. Health cannot be imposed on anyone. Health is not only a right, it is a responsibility to be shared by every segmentin the community. 259 PRINCIPLES AND METHODS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 259To be balanced and successful, community projects should integrate three kinds of talent around a common goal\u2014\"Head, Hands, and Heart\"\u2014or asacademics might word it, theory, practice, and commitment. Communities without previous experience of having all social levels working together will be more likely to support activities addressing their needs thanto initiate them. Start with a small program that can show visible results rather quickly. A small success builds a sense of self-efficacy (group competency), cooperativeskills, and leadership experience that equip the group for sustained longer-term projects and larger successes. Visible success helps a group survive. Agricultural extension agents in rural North America started this kind of work in the 1930s. They found their first tasks involved bringing people to-gether to show them how to interact and do projects cooperatively, as well ashow to make step-by-step plans. This was not didactic teaching, but a \"let usdo it together\" approach. The first project may have been to get rural womento share their skills in helping each participant to plant a small vegetable gar-den (see section on cancer prevention). Later they were taught how to pre-serve foods by boiling them in jars. The content of each project was deter-mined by the group's perceived needs. The most valuable products alwayswere the organizational and leadership skills the participants learned. In many localities, women are more ready to participate, work, and learn together than aremen. In such situations, agencies start with thebest motivated people. After a year or so, othersorts of people will want help to get themselvesactive, too. The outside trainer who fits in bestis usually a person of the same culture and gen-der as the participants. Sustaining community participation depends on attitude and behavior changes, building organizational skills, and the patience to keep working for longer-range outcomes. All these take time to happen. Existing social groups, organizations, and agencies should be sought out tohelp promote the health programs before trying to bring together a totallynew action group. Community participation in identifying a need and planning to remedy it takes more time and effort than bringing in a ready-made program from thecentral government. However, community participation at the formative 260 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHIn many places, women are more ready to participate, work, and learn together than are men\u2014in those localities, agencies should start working with the community's women.51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 260states gives the community a sense of ownership of the effort, self-esteem, and power that pays off in better popular response to the program, and muchlonger continuation of the program activity. When encouraged to participate in health programs, especially prevention ef-forts, people will be educated by means of their participation. All behavior\u2014including project participation\u2014requires rewards in order to be sustained. The following list offers some clear rewards for groups and in-dividuals to keep them putting in their efforts: (1) they make new social con-tacts and friends; (2) they build self-esteem and self-efficacy; (3) they enhancetheir personal image in the community; (4) they satisfy the desire to do some-thing new, to be pioneers, leaders; (5) they help solve a common problem orleave a lasting improvement in their community; and (6) they share in the en-ergy generated by group activity (this list of benefits has been adapted fromI. Rojas Aleta (1984). Persons interested in learning more about employing community participation as part of changing infrastructure, lifestyle, health behavior, and overall well-being may consult the numerous monographs and scientific articles publishedeach year. Focus on the ones that include practical guidelines and/or data show-ing efficacy. One of the best practical guides is Anne V. Whyte's \"Guidelines forplanning community participation activities in water supply and sanitation proj-ects\" (Whyte, 1986). Although this 53-page monograph is addressed directly toenvironmental projects, the flow charts, data collection instruments, and twelvestages of activity can be readily modified for other health goals. If a new programcould supply only one pre-1996 resource to its workers, this would be the mosthelpful operationally. Up to now this chapter has reviewed ethical and strategic principles of health pro- grams and some strategies for becoming partners with the community. The fol-lowing sections will flesh out these principles with strategies for conceptualizingand achieving the changes in perception and behavior that build better health. OVERLAPPING THEORIES OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE Over the centuries, teachers have developed ideas about how children learn.Philosophers and psychologists organized these ideas and practices into theoriesand teaching guides. But it was not until the 20th century that a garden oflearning and behavioral theories came into full bloom. As is true for many fields having competing theories, different learning and be- havior theories are more or less applicable depending on what is to be learned,the kinds of people involved, and the circumstances present. Therefore, this 261 PRINCIPLES AND METHODS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 261chapter will treat the host of available models and theories about health-related behavior like a workshop, displaying many tools shown useful in clinical andcommunity settings, without regard to philosophical consistency or compre-hensiveness. These tools can be used in various combinations to construct localprograms. Readers interested in systematic presentation of theories of health be-havior may consult books devoted to this topic, such as Health Behavior and Health Education (Glanz, Lewis, and Rimer, 1997). OVERALL ORIENTATION Enlisting the cooperation of communities, families, and individuals in changing behaviors to improve health is more complex than it seemed 70 years ago. At thattime, providing information about a disease and the necessary actions to preventit appeared to be enough to bring about substantial public acceptance. Thus, thesimpler epidemic diseases came under control. As multicausal diseases and in-juries began to be targeted and public and personal agendas became more com-plex (including conflicts between corporate profits and public health), group andindividual health-related behaviors also became more difficult to change. Figure 12.1 diagrams key areas to address when seeking to change health-related behavior. By filling in specific content the table can be used as a guideline toplanning programs ranging from immunization to smoking cessation. As many field trials have demonstrated in recent decades, merely providing in- formation is not enough to improve health behaviors. There is an essential nextstep to changing any behavior\u2014motivation. The health promoter analyzescommunity and individual priorities and either tries to make pro-health motivesstronger than existing priorities, or harnesses existing priorities and needs topush forward the health promotion program. The existing motivations need notbe health related in order to be used successfully. They can be based on a desireto be a good parent, a good athlete, or a good teacher; or they can be tied tocommunity pride, wanting a healthier work force, or raising productivity. Oncea health promotion activity has been carefully evaluated for its chances of suc-cess, risks of failure, and possibilities of unexpected side effects\u2014and the balanceis found to be clearly positive\u2014then health workers should be open to carefullyselect all those motivations, perceived needs, and priorities that will advance thecommunity toward successful health improvement. The following example il-lustrates these points. In a WHO Region in the 1970s, an international consultant sought to expand staffing for local health promotion efforts. He used the standard approach andconducted workshops and training sessions for staff at the ministries of healthand related government agencies in 19 emerging states and territories. Despitealmost universal enthusiasm for increasing health promotion, only two of the 19 262 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 262jurisdictions started any new program. To pursue the goal at a regional confer- ence of health ministers, an international staff spent months and much moneypreparing an elaborate presentation about all the valuable things health educa-tion/health promotion teams can do to prevent disease. The effort was greetedwith polite approval and thanks. In contrast, at the same meeting, a Minister ofHealth from one of the smallest and poorer states gave a simple \"show and tell,\"praising the contributions made by his few health educators to the outreach ofhis entire health program. His simple report drew standing applause, and he\u2014not the international experts\u2014became the magnet for informal discussion dur-ing the recesses. And yes, several other countries soon had programs running.Ministers of health from nearby countries and territories said, \"If that little placecan have such a program, our proud state must have it, too.\" The moral\u2014the bottom line\u2014of this true sions . . . then consider the following: Group insiders have more motivating power than outsiders. This is becausethey are well known within the community and their enthusiasm is experi-enced within the context of the group's shared experience and culture. 263 PRINCIPLES AND METHODS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGEENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES Social and ideological environments in the home, at work, through the mass media, andthrough health care providers. BELIEFS True or false information MOTIVES Feelings and needsACTIONS Habits and skillsFIGURE 12.1. Basic conceptual model for health-related behavior: Environment influ- ences act upon beliefs, motives, and to determine health-related behaviors.51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 263Logic and facts can be slow motivators. Personal experience, anecdotes, and enthusiasm work more quickly. Workers and administrators expect experts and resource persons to present al-ways new (always additional workload) programs in an elaborate and urgentway. That is what they are paid to do, and they never disappoint. But whenrespected individuals step outside their expected roles and scripts to reportsomething that touches a shared need, that is when ears and minds open. Competition, and maybe a touch of envy, can motivate more strongly thanlogic. First, weigh the ethics and the long-term implications; then utilize eachtrue and fair motivator that advances personal and public well being (and dis-advantages no one) to get movement to resolve health problems. MAKING PROGRAMS HAPPEN AND FLOURISH The final stage for health promotion is to teach the actions, habits, and skills re-quired to keep communities, families, and persons acting permanently in health-ful ways. Many communities and individuals already know what they need to do to reduce health risks, and they clearly want toachieve that goal. They just don't quite know howto make it happen. For individuals, this meanslearning and practicing some of the techniquesfor changing behavior. For communities, it maymean learning how to stimulate and organizecommunity participation which, in turn, gener-ates the structure and plan to carry out the pro-gram of health enhancement. Figure 12.1 reminds us that all goal-directed efforts designed to transmit knowl- edge, motivation, skills, and habits take place in environments that simultane-ously have interpersonal, community, social, cultural-ideological, and physical(infrastructural) properties. Health messages are spread through interactionstaking place in these environments. All training of actions, habits, and skills ultimately occurs at the individual level\u2014one brain at a time. Depending on the roles of the trainees involved,however, the skilled performance of these actions may have an impact on theentire community, on various families, or just on the individual trainees. Thefollowing paragraphs explore each scenario. At the community level, city workers can be taught to repair water pumps and pipes, and safely and regularly treat water with chlorination and, if needed, 264 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHMany communities and individuals already know what they need to do to reduce health risks, and they clearly want to achieve that goal\u2014 they just don't quite know how to make it happen.51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 264fluoridation. Such an effort also might involve teaching clinic managers how to keep vaccines at the proper temperature, prevent loss and waste of clinic sup-plies, or keep clinics staffed and open on schedule. Perhaps most critical for thelong term is providing information, motivation (i.e., a sense of mission), andskills-training to schoolteachers and community leaders to prioritize health,model healthful ways, and finally spread them, especially to children and youth. At the family level, some of the habits and skills that need teaching include how family decision makers can plant gardens and provide the most needed foods forthe family, such as legumes to provide proteins and fruits and vegetables that canprevent many chronic diseases later in life. Mothers also can be trained to pre-pare and use oral rehydration fluids. Skills that preserve health within the fam-ily include ensuring the home's safety by removing hazards that might allow falls,cuts, burns, poisonings, insect bites, and exposure to human wastes. The bene-fits of such trauma prevention are crucial for children, yet also extend to all ages. Finally, individuals must be motivated, informed, and trained on how to take care of their own health. They must be encouraged to ask themselves, \"If I don't takecare of my own life, how can I expect anyone else to do so?\" General health im-provement for the more than six billion voyagers now on our planet demands atremendous increase in effective health self-care. The responsibility of health pro-fessionals goes far beyond delivering health care themselves. Perhaps more impor-tantly, they must enable and stimulate communities and individuals themselves todeliver preventive and primary self-care. Self-directed behavior change has beenproven to work. It should be more widely taught and used throughout the world. COLLECTING INFORMATION FOR PLANNING AN INTERVENTION Based upon the overall orientation presented in Figure 12.1, what needs to be known about the target population to be used to shape an outreach program? Acomprehensive understanding of the group to be reached, the helpful or hin-dering aspects of their environment, the group's beliefs about the threat posedto them by a health problem and its causes, and the attributes of the desiredhealth action in behavioral and social terms, all need to be entered into effectiveoutreach programs. Figure 12.2 shows the three areas of information needed,their interactions, and their impacts on developing outreach programs. Thisbackground information will identify what kinds of messages and persuasionsneed to be delivered to change knowledge and beliefs and to teach motivations,skills, and finally to trigger behavior. The categories, detailed content, and theinteractions suggested in the figure have been assembled from the health-beliefmodel, social learning theory, and the theory of planned behavior and socialmarketing. The following text expands on the figure. 265 PRINCIPLES AND METHODS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 265266 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH Attributes of the group to be reached: Main cultural priorities, Level of education, Openness to new ways, Functioning social structures, Stage of economic development, Physical environment, Infrastructure, Channels of communications.

Participation in health action.Behavioral intention to take actionFIGURE 12.2. Model for encouraging community changes toward healthful behaviors.51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 266ATTRIBUTES OF GROUP TO BE REACHED The stage of the program and the nature of the health action required define the group to be reached. Early in program planning the groups and persons whosesupport and participation will be needed first must be reached. Doing this willhelp later forms of outreach to proceed successfully. Initial groups include thecommunity's formal and informal power structures, health professionals, andopinion leaders. At some point between planning the intervention and deliver-ing it, the essential person or group to be reached convincingly is the one whocontrols the required resources\u2014power, money, or personnel. This person orgroup may be outside the organizational chart of the health and medical systems.It might be a chief executive, a village chief, the wealthiest family in the com-munity, or a political party. The program must offer a win-win-win situation forthose with power, for the public, and perhaps even for the health proponents. The subpopulation at risk of the health problem may be addressed later. Health efforts such as financing maternal and child health clinics, setting up school im-munization services, or building sewage treatment plants, usually must win overcommunity and fiscal decision-makers before an appeal can be made to the gen-eral public. For child health programs, parents and community leaders are in-volved first and the young children, later. The population's educational level and the communication channels that most ef- fectively reach community members influence both the sophistication of the mes-sages and how they should be formatted. For example, some subpopulations maybe better reached by posters than by television, or by radio rather than throughthe print media. Sometimes, the media can best set the agenda for public discus-sion. Word-of-mouth through social networks can spread the desired motivationsand readiness for action. The group's sense of self-efficacy\u2014the power to accom-plish tasks\u2014will shape the messages (and the programs), such that each subgroupwill feel that what it is called upon to do is both feasible and valuable. The existing infrastructure in a location where a program is being launched is an important environmental determinant. Are roads and public transportationsufficient to provide the public easy access to program sites? Should the programbe run from mobile clinics? Can vaccines or drugs be kept under refrigeration?Can local personnel be hired or must all staff be brought in? Are telephonefacilities adequate for program coordination? Each leadership echelon and each segment of the community has its own pri- orities. For elected officials this might mean pleasing the community, their po-litical party, the central government, or a few financial supporters. For healthprofessionals it might mean pleasing local opinion leaders, gaining professionalprestige, or reducing the frequency of a widespread disease. Schoolteachers, fac-tory owners, and community agencies all have good reasons for helping to im- 267 PRINCIPLES AND METHODS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 267prove the health of those with whom they work. Calling upon enlightened self- interest usually makes people more willing to become involved, than does sim-ply asking people to do what is good, right, or charitable. Proposed health interventions should be promoted not only for the health ben- efits to the \"treated\" subpopulation, but also as steps toward meeting the self-defined goals of each assisting, contributing group. Thus, while anti-diarrhealprograms for infants or anti-HIV programs for teenagers each have similar plansof action wherever on earth they are conducted, the promotion of the interven-tions and the reasons given for enlisting different parts of the community willwork best if tailored to the local setting. ATTRIBUTES OF THE DISEASE OR DISORDER Some health interventions, such as immunizations, target specific diseases. Oth-ers, such as smoking cessation campaigns, target many diseases with a singleprogram. Still others, such as nutrition and exercise programs, aim more at im-mediate health improvement, although they are also well proven long-term pre-venters of chronic disease conditions. The \"health belief model\" (Becker and Maiman, 1980) emphasizes the program recipient's perceptions, beliefs, and feelings about diseases\u2014specifically, whatare the chances of getting the disease (susceptibility) and how damaging wouldit be (severity). Diseases to which people are highly susceptible, but whose sever-ity is almost nil\u2014such as the common cold\u2014don't move people to preventiveaction. Neither do severe or fatal diseases that are extremely rare\u2014such as rarecancers. Diseases or conditions that combine moderate susceptibility and mod-erate severity seem to generate a perceived threat that moves people toward act-ing in preventive ways (depending on other simultaneous factors, such as thoselisted in Figure 12.2). Something about the community's beliefs and feelings about the targeted dis- ease or condition can be learned by bringing together focus (discussion) groups,each one representing a sub-community defined by neighborhood or social sta-tus. This is a good way to learn local names for the condition, its presumedcauses, the qualities (often negative) of the people at highest risk, and any \"in-side rumors\" regarding proposed prevention or cure. The most important in-formation for designing program communication and plans is usually internalto the targeted group, is rarely volunteered to health professionals, and often isexpressed in simple slang terms. A human group is never an \"empty pitcher\" waiting for health professionals to pour information about an illness. Every group is already full of beliefs and feel-ings about every health problem their group has experienced. The current folk 268 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 268wisdom may need to be replaced, at least in part, with more effective preventive beliefs and behavior. ATTRIBUTES OF THE HEALTH ACTION Beliefs and feelings about recommended health actions also enter into this model's equation. Ideally, the targeted population must perceive the health ac-tion as effective. The action also must be safe and socially acceptable. For ex-ample, parents won't boil water if they don't believe that doing so will help pre-vent diarrhea in their children. Nor will they get immunizations for theirchildren if they think this might have bad side effects. Some preventive behav-iors may violate local norms unless performed according to culturally requiredrestrictions, such as having female caregivers administer Pap smears. A health program may seek to introduce a new provision or behavior (say, a new vaccine, a new food to be eaten more often, or additional sanitary standards) orto eliminate a current habit or condition (such as tobacco use, withholding foodfrom infants with diarrhea, sedentary lifestyle, or obesity). Another considera-tion is whether what is being introduced or eliminated is a daily behavior or anoccasional one, like a mammogram every two years or checking the safety of aheat stove at the beginning of winter. Tactics and reminder cues need to be dif-ferent for daily than for occasional health behaviors. Adding a health behavior requires positive cues and rewards to remind people to perform them, either on a daily basis or at proper intervals. Removing un-healthy behavior requires different strategies, including withdrawing cues andrewards for the existing habit, replacing the old habit with a healthier one (suchas eating fruit instead of fatty snacks), and providing cues and rewards for thehealthier substitute. Conditioning and behavior change studies have consis-tently shown that rewarding a substitute, healthier behavior brings about aquicker, more enduring change than punishing the old behavior or making itmore difficult or costly. A general principle in a person's decision to perform a given action or change a behav-ior is that person's reckoning whether thebenefits to be derived from the action aregreater than the effort and \"cost\" involvedfor him or her and for those for whom thedecision is made. Thus, a parent will tally(often unconsciously) the total time, effort, and cost of taking a child for a reg-ular health check-up and compare that to the total anticipated benefit to thechild's health and growth and the reduced risk of future burden upon the par-ent of having a sick child. Similarly, when weighing how to spend their budget, 269 PRINCIPLES AND METHODS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGEStudies have consistently shown that rewarding a substitute, healthierbehavior brings about a quicker, moreenduring change than punishing theold behavior or making it moredifficult or costly.51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 269district officials may consider the benefits-to-costs ratio of a spraying program to control mosquito-borne diseases versus building a new road. Health advo-cates need to document benefits and costs of health interventions and the num-ber of citizens who would benefit from them as effectively as other interests dowhen trying to persuade regional, community, corporate, or sectoral decision-makers. Economists at local universities (or the students they supervise) canhelp immensely with this process as part of their public service. People and groups may move toward improving their health or that of the com- munity for health-related reasons or for reasons that don't really have to do withhealth. Teenagers, for example, may brush their teeth more to have an attractivesmile than for dental health. A man may reduce his risk factors for chronic dis-ease, even though he doesn't enjoy it, because he believes his children need himhealthy and working for two more decades. In an early oral polio vaccine pro-gram, many adults felt they might not need the vaccine, but took it \"becausethat's what everybody is doing.\" A politician may support building a new waterpurification plant in part because he wants his name engraved over the entrance. Figure 12.3 illustrates how \"rewards\" and \"costs\" (broadly defined) affect the performance of healthful and harmful behaviors. To increase healthful behaviorsmaximize the rewards and minimize the costs (e.g., time, effort). To reduceharmful behaviors maximize costs and reduce their rewards\u2014for example, taxeson cigarettes and alcohol can be raised and severe penalties against reckless ordrunken driving can be consistently applied. Taken together, the characteristics of the group to be reached, its environment, and the perceived attributes of the disease and the health action required inter-act to generate a disposition to act or not to act (Figure 12.2). The \"Theory of 270 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHREINFORCE HEALTHY ACTIONS Minimize costs and maximize rewardsMinimize rewards and Maximize costs REDUCE HARMFUL ACTIONSFIGURE 12.3. Use of rewards and costs to change the balance between healthy and harmful behaviors.51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 270Reasoned Action\" refers a \"behavioral intention\" (Glanz, Lewis, and Rimer, 1997). All these attributes and perceptions can either be modified ortaken into account as the behavior change program is shaped. The followingsection discusses how to use this information in making a diagnosis of the healthbehavior problem. MAKING A BEHAVIORAL DIAGNOSIS Physicians are most successful in treating disease when they first work to make the correct diagnosis. The same is true for health professionals trying to changeillness- or trauma-promoting behavior. Before laying out an intervention or pro-gram, a health worker must do what is necessary to understand the determi-nants of the current behavior (or lack of behavior) and then work to introduceand consolidate the new healthier actions. Figure 12.1 presents a framework listing possible ingredients of the problem of unhealthful behavior. To make a behavioral diagnosis, program planners iden-tify the barriers to health-promoting changes that are present in terms of beliefs,motives, skills, and physical, social, and cultural environmental influences. Theshortcomings of previous interventions often point out these barriers. The di-agnostic process has the following steps, whether they target individuals orgroups. (The following scheme for diagnosing health-behavior problems andshaping intervention is described more fully in Last, 1986, Chapter 30.) Fully describe the problems of health-related behavior in operationalsteps. This is the equivalent of clarifying the \"presenting complaint\" a patient brings to a doctor. In the control of schistosomiasis, for example, this calls forconducting studies of local habits of urine and feces disposal, as well as un-derstanding individual and community contact with rivers and lakes, whichare the reservoirs for the agent. In control of obesity, operational issues in-clude the amount and quality of calories eaten, their \"vectors\" (foods), andthe circumstances encouraging and discouraging their consumption. Obtain a history of the problem. How long has it gone on? Is it consistent? Is it intermittent? Is the entire community affected? Does it only affect a sub-group? Did some event precede or coincide with the onset of the problem? Determine the behavioral dynamics. What encourages change versus a con- tinuation of the problem? What are the rewards and costs that maintain theold way? What subgroups want change? Which subgroups obstruct change? Arrive at a behavioral diagnosis. What needs to be changed? Who can best make this happen? Where are the barriers? More educated subgroups mayneed only skills learning, while others may lack strong enough motivation. 271 PRINCIPLES AND METHODS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 271Too often health professionals want to change the patients or the target group, when what needs to be changed first is the health worker, aspects ofprogram delivery, or other concurrent community problems. Make a \"treatment plan\"\u2014i.e., design an intervention\u2014in cooperationwith the program's recipients. Involve patients, families, and the commu- nity as active participants, so that everyone owns part of the success of thehealth improvement. The program should consist of specific small steps, thusproviding many occasions for success and rewards, and giving all concerneda sense of moving forward with a greater sense of self-efficacy and empower-ment. (Also see section \"Conveying Learning and Values to Overcome Health Vulnerabilities\" in Chapter 4.) Always pilot test the program on a small group. \"Patch the holes\" in the plan before launching out into the deeper waters of the whole community. Deliver the program and evaluate its effectiveness. Adjust or repeat the ef- fort as needed, then move forward to the next milestone. PRESENTING PROGRAMS SUCCESSFULLY Program planning covers two components\u2014the program's presentation or mar- keting to the group to be reached, and the program's organization and delivery. Prior to actually delivering services, program promoters should make a \"com- munity diagnosis,\" both as discussed in the previous section and as displayed inFigure 12.2. This will not be an umbrella diagnosis covering the entire com-munity, but rather a specific diagnosis targeting different subgroups. At thisstage, one inputs the following information, as collected in the section on \"Col-lecting Information for Planning an Intervention\": the characteristics of the groups to be reached and in what sequence they willbe targeted; the groups' perceptions and feelings about the health problems being ad-dressed; the health cooperation and social and behavior changes being sought; and the groups' feelings of liking or disliking, trusting or doubting, the peopleand the agency bringing the proposed program. People act on the basis of what they believe and feel, even if it is not accurate. The task of the intervention's pre-delivery stage is to motivate and educate theselected subpopulation by getting it: 272 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 272to learn about and relate positively with the health-promoters; to hear, read, and discuss together the agenda of the program; to replace erroneous ideas with accurate beliefs; and to replace apathy and fearful avoidance with positive motivation to do what is needed to prevent disease and promote health. People at all educational levels are full of ideas about their health, their illnesses, and their world. From a health professional's perspective some of their ideas mayseem wrong; that is, less likely than other ideas to lead to behaviors that reducehealth problems. For both the group beinghelped and the group seeking to be helpful,lacking accurate information is less of abarrier than is clinging to misleading ideas. Sharing the need to have a given program and that program's goals with opinion lead-ers from the selected subpopulation andenlisting their approval will open the door to quicker public cooperation. Ask-ing those same local leaders for advice on how to promote and deliver the pro-gram\u2014and using some of that advice\u2014will help avoid cultural and local polit-ical blunders. Another bonus: program planners also will be held in muchhigher esteem by the public. After all, people always respect the wisdom of thosewho ask their advice. The strategy for intervention will differ by the stage of disease\u2014primary, sec- ondary, or tertiary\u2014at which intervention is aimed. It also will differ depend-ing on whether the health behavior change involves doing something new ordifferently, or whether it consists of stopping an established, unhealthy practice.Finally, it will differ depending on whether the targets for change are politicaland community leaders, health professionals, parents of children, or individualsin the at risk group. Three program traps to avoid: Never start a screening program unless there are ready-to-function facilities for following persons who screen positive. Never raise public demand for a health service unless its personnel and facil-ities are ready for the influx of users. Never raise fears of a disease or epidemic unless the services needed to reducesuch fears and risks are readily available. 273 PRINCIPLES AND METHODS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGESharing the need to have a program with opinion leaders from the selectedsubpopulation and enlisting theirsupport will open the door to quickerpublic cooperation.51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 273Errors such as these not only cause an immediate backlash by persons and their families stirred to action and then not helped. They also plant a distrust for fu-ture programs proposed by the agency. COMMUNICATING HEALTH MESSAGES There are at least twelve channels for getting messages to populations or sub-groups (Jenkins and Hewitt, 1992). Some communities may lack some of these,but may have other, locally unique ones to add. Twelve Channels for Communication 1.Regional and national government. 2.Nongovernmental organizations. 3.The mass media. 4.Community leaders. 5.Businesses and labor groups. 6.Schools and teachers. 7.Those who set health care standards (e.g., insurers or managed care and ac- creditation agencies). 8.Health professionals\u2014medically trained, alternative, or traditional healers. 9.Local informal or formal social groups, including clubs and local religious congregations and their leaders. 10.\"Gatekeepers\" to seeking help, such as clergy, counselors, pharmacists, schoolteachers, nurses, athletic coaches, beauticians, barbers, bartenders. 11.Families, friends, coworkers. 12.Individuals. Health program planners should select only those channels that seem appropri- ate at each stage of their specific program. Adding channels usually costs addi-tional resources, but that investment may be warranted if the program receivesonly half-hearted support after using the channels first selected. In a multicul- 274 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 274tural area, make sure that the messages are delivered in all dialects and cultural styles present in the population, using terms that even those groups with thelowest educational levels can understand. TAILORING PROGRAMS TO THE TARGETED GROUP Disease and disability do not rain down randomly across the community. Often, an identifiable subgroup representing some 20% to 30% of the popu-lation will experience 70% to 80% of certain conditions, for example, infantmortality and deaths due to certain infections (e.g., tuberculosis, AIDS), fires,homicides, certain cancers, and industrial toxicities (Jenkins, T uthill, and Tan-nenbaum, 1977). The high-risk subgroup might be identified by geographicarea or demographic characteristics. Special programs, community involvement,effective outreach, and continuing follow-up are required to reach these sub-groups and change their behaviors. Involving the targeted subgroup in the de-sign and operation of its program will speed adoption through the social net-work, as will the sense of ownership conferred by involvement of local opinionleaders. Presenting and delivering health programs requires the same flexibility as tailor- ing a suit of clothes. Different customers prefer different colors and textures offabrics. In marketing health programs, the customers help determine the styleand content of the messages and the channels through which they are delivered.Health interventions also can be tailored for size and shape. When, where, how, and by whom the intervention will be delivered should be \"fitted\" to themedical history, presenting complaints, be-liefs, feelings, motivations, and convenienceof the publics to be reached. This results in greater program effectiveness (Campbell,1994). Those who work in the real estate business often say that the three most importantthings to consider when buying propertyare location, location, and, once again, lo-cation. Health service planners trying toobtain maximum participation likewise have three most important things toachieve\u2014convenience, convenience, and convenience. Consider the following: Convenience in location. Places should be easily accessible by walking, pub-lic transportation, and other means. Convenience in times when the service is provided. Schedule services dur-ing evening hours for daytime workers, weekends so rural residents can get 275 PRINCIPLES AND METHODS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGEPresenting and delivering health programs requires the same flexibilityas tailoring a suit of clothes. Inmarketing health programs, thecustomers help determine the styleand content of the messages and thechannels through which they aredelivered. 51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 275into town, and at schools and during school time for the benefit of school- children. Convenience and comfort in participating in the program. Convenientlysited and scheduled services also should be delivered without bureaucraticcomplexity or long waits, and should be offered in a friendly, locally appro-priate style that makes clients comfortable, pleased with the service, and in-clined to return for this or other programs\u2014these aspects of convenience andcomfort may be described as \"user friendly.\" Educational and motivational efforts at the beginning of programming should establish the public's expectancy that participating will be rewarding, safe, andconvenient. The delivery of the health service should be designed to make thosepromises come true. The design and delivery should minimize effort, incon-venience, and cost, and maximize the perceived rewards and aptness of thehealth action, as well as the helpfulness of the health workers involved. The importance of \"convenience, convenience, convenience\" in promoting the actual behavior desired from the target group by no means should be the lastconsideration among those listed in this section. Leaving convenience to lastwould be easy to do, because most health behavior theories, including the in-trapersonal and interpersonal theories reviewed in the volume edited by Glanz,Lewis, and Rimer (1997), are heavily weighted by cognitions, decisions, and in-tentions. Field workers with broad experience in health programs may concludethat the more complex of these theories apply only to persons who think withthe same complexity as the psychologists who contrived the theories. This beliefhas not as yet been disproved by field studies. People participate in health actionsfor many reasons, including some not related to health. With a well-marketedprogram that is conveniently available, many participants will make their deci-sion on the spur of the moment. Field studies such as that by Montano and Taplin (1991), dealing with use of mammography, have found that \"facilitating conditions\" (convenience) werethe strongest of the many predictors in their relation to actual behavior. In fact,the simple use of reminder postcards nearly doubled the probability of having amammogram in this study. A very successful immunization program in Florida (USA), carried out when oral polio vaccine was first introduced in the 1960s, was based on the principle,\"Make it easier to take the vaccine than to avoid it.\" This was followed by asecond principle, \"Teach the people only what they need to know to make aninformed decision to take the vaccine.\" By focusing on these two principles,health educators could avoid detailing polio's pathogenesis or the biology of vac-cine preparation, and instead focus on the simple message: \"A virus causes polio. 276 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 276This vaccine contains a weakened kind of virus that will safely and effectively prevent polio and its damage. And many people will be taking the oral vaccine.\"This anecdote underlines the fact that the focus of health education/promotionefforts must be on changing behavior, not on teaching medical science. TheFlorida program concentrated on setting up hundreds of distribution sites thatwere open both days and evenings. The effort was supported by mass mediacoverage and the involvement of community groups in every definable socio-cultural niche (Johnson et al., 1962). To extrapolate from this example, if a pro-gram were initiated to convert a village to use a pure water supply, it is impor-tant to place pipes and water taps so that no matter where a family lives, thepure water source is more convenient than the old sources of polluted water. And going back to the polio vaccine example, one of the strongest predictors for adults taking the polio vaccine was their reporting having friends who also weretaking it. In fact, 90% of adults who reported that \"all or almost all\" of theirfriends and acquaintances had taken the vaccine, did so themselves; whereasonly 11% of respondents saying that none of their friends and acquaintanceswere taking the vaccine had taken the vaccine themselves. Participating in in-formal networks and belonging to organizations served to connect people towhat was happening in their community, thus raising the probability that theywould take the vaccine. These observations support the idea of enlisting groupsorganized for other purposes to spread positive, encouraging information aboutthe health program on a temporary basis. Civic clubs, labor groups, local reli-gious congregations\u2014in fact, most of the 12 channels of communication de-tailed in the section \"Communicating Health Messages\" earlier in this chap-ter\u2014are willing to promote health interventions for a limited period of time.This approach also makes individuals feel that people like them will participatein the program (Northcutt et al., 1964). These strategies diffuse new ideas andactions throughout the population (Glanz, Lewis, and Rimer, 1997, Part 4). A SAMPLING OF SELF-DIRECTED BEHAVIOR CHANGE TACTICS Most cigarette smokers in most nations (perhaps 90%) already know that smok- ing harms them in many ways. Most also claim that they want to quit, and manyadd that they have tried, but lack the willpower to stay quit. The teaching ofhabits and skills to remain tobacco-free will be of greatest benefit to these people. There are a host of such simple habits, counterarguments, and counteractions that have been found helpful in many successful, effective smoking cessationprograms. These will be discussed more comprehensively in Chapter 13. Thefollowing section outlines a few examples of simple action steps that could con-tribute to smoking cessation. They can easily be extrapolated for changing other 277 PRINCIPLES AND METHODS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 277unhealthful behaviors, such as careless driving, eating junk food, indulging in unsafe sexual activity, or forgetting to take essential medications. The psycho-logical purposes of each action will be listed first followed by the content eachmight assume in a smoking cessation program. Raise awareness of the extent of the problem\u2014i.e., have trainee record on apaper every time he/she takes a cigarette. Build commitment (motivation) to change to better health\u2014i.e., have traineelist all the benefits of stopping smoking, especially immediate ones such assaving money, having cleaner breath and teeth, recovering a taste for food, set-ting a good example for children, avoiding burns on clothes and furniture,and increasing one's sense of effectiveness and power. These benefits should beraised to a high priority in the trainee's life. Encourage trainee to make a public statement to family and friends of his/hernew healthier behavior. Public commitment intensifies personal compliance.In some communities the graduating class of each smoking cessation courseis congratulated, individually named, and interviewed by the local newspaper.This praises graduates and enlists the support of their friends for the newhealth plan. Dissuade automatic, reflex repetition of habit; rather, teach trainee to make aconscious choice to smoke. For example, have trainee wrap pack of cigarettesin two layers of paper held by elastic bands, to give trainee a few seconds tothink about the decision to smoke. T rainee can smoke anytime he/she wishes,but the pack must be rewrapped after each use. Replace any motor behaviors associated with the habit\u2014e.g., chew gum, sucktoothpicks, keep hands occupied, rather than smoking. Counter physiologic smoking withdrawal cues\u2014e.g., drink water frequentlyto eliminate dry mouth, sip on a flavored sugar-free drink to give a pleasanttaste and take the edge off hunger, and get busy with something as a distrac-tion from boredom. Enlist social support for changing into new behaviors. For example, havetrainee find a family member, coworker, or friend to give emotional and prac-tical support. T wo persons sharing the same problem and wanting to changetogether can really help each other\u2014witness weight-loss clubs or the twelve-step programs to stop alcohol and drug use. Help trainee develop a specific \"quit plan,\" using the steps above, and havehim or her set a schedule on paper, including a final \"quit date\" when all to-bacco use will stop. 278 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 278Modify the immediate environment to support the changed behavior\u2014e.g., encourage trainees to remove ashtrays from home and workplace, give awaylighters, ask other smokers not to smoke near them or give them a cigarette. Set up a series of self-rewards for achieving each milestone in the plan. This couldinclude going to an enjoyable event, or buying a piece of clothing or small gift. SPREADING NEW HEALTH BEHAVIORS THROUGH THE COMMUNITY Many health promotion programs are not brief, nor intensive, nor time-limited efforts, as are immunization campaigns. Rather, they may involve continuingchange, as does smoking cessation; or ongoing community change enlisting suc-cessive waves of individuals, as in obtaining prenatal care or following safer sex-ual practices. For such efforts to change and maintain healthier communitynorms, the studies of diffusion of innovation are instructive. Studies of the adoption and spread of new ways of doing things were first con- ducted in rural areas, as farmers adopted new agricultural practices. The ideasand techniques learned there have been used in health programs for about 40 years. These rural origins make promoting \"innovation and diffusion\" wellfitted for rural as well as urban health interventions. Because the mass media now has almost universal penetration, it is useful to en- list persons well known locally or nationally to appear on TV, radio, the printmedia (including billboards), and public gatherings to explain and display thenew health behavior, to \"model\" participation in health programs, and to live inhealthy ways themselves. Persons selected to present the messages for health pro-grams should be: widely known, respected and trusted, honestly reflecting theirown health behaviors, and willing to spread their messages through at least someof the channels of communication. (See the section on \"Communicating HealthMessages,\" earlier in this chapter.) Studies on how new beliefs and behaviors are spread have shown that there is an established sequence through which groups become \"converted.\" In most diffu-sion studies already published the rate of adopting the \"new way\" over timeforms something like a bell-shaped normal curve, but often with a longer,slower rate of adoption at the beginning. The rate of new adoption slows afterthe peak of the curve, when the majority of the population are already practic-ing the new way. See Figure 12.4 for a schematic timeline of the diffusion of abehavior innovation in a community. Everett Rogers, the pioneer researcher in this field, in his book Diffusion of In- novations (1995), sets out five successive theoretical community groups in terms 279 PRINCIPLES AND METHODS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 279of their sequence of adopting new ways, some of their typical attributes, and approximate size in past studies. The following sections review these categories.This knowledge can help health leaders to design the sequential outreach effortsof health improvement programs. The basic work on the Rogers diffusionmodel was performed mainly in industrialized nations. Some modifications maybe needed for different cultures and stages of development. INNOVATORS These are venturesome people who have more than the average number of con-tacts outside their community. They have access to outside news and discuss itwith friends who are often also seeking to learn more about the outside world,new developments, and a better life. The majority often views them as having\"only one foot inside the local culture.\" Innovators (compared to the rest of their commu- nity) tend to have more education, more access tothe mass media, and larger homes or farms. Theyalso tend to feel and act more independently, feelsecure for reasons other than social conformity,and are willing to live with some uncertainty. In-novators are a very small group, usually less than5% of a community. Along with \"change agents\" (who often are outsiders) and local sponsors of health programs, innovators are those who first demonstrate the new way to thecommunity. They are the persons from whom the next category of persons\u2014theearly adopters\u2014take their cues. 280 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH45 5%Resistant remainder 17%Early majority 30%Late majority 33%40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 TimelineRate of behavior change /H17075 /H17075FIGURE 12.4. Schematic timeline for the diffusion of an innovation through a commu- nity with the five conceptual groups in sequence of adopting the change.

They tend to have higher ed-ucational levels, control more resources, and receive greater respect than mostother citizens. The majority regards early adopters as good sources of informa-tion and guidance, and as more dependable and prudent than innovators. Earlyadopters represent between 10%-15% of the population. Early adopters have a greater sense of self-efficacy\u2014a sense that they have more power to control their circumstances\u2014than do later adopters and the reluctantremnant (the laggards), who may be the last to make the change. Early adoptersare less tied to the past, think abstractly as well as concretely, and place moretrust in science. They travel more and participate in more social activities thanthose who delay acceptance of the new way. Health program change agents sent into the community can speed up accept- ance of a new health intervention or behavior by aiming the early stage of theprogram at innovators and early adopters, who share many characteristics. Incities, this early targeting can be done bymaking presentations to organizationsholding meetings, and asking at each place,\"What other groups or persons should havea chance to discuss this program with us?\"In rural areas, informal inquiries can bedone to determine who were the first per-sons to accept prior new innovations andwhom would people ask about the advantages and disadvantages of a new pro-gram. The persons most frequently mentioned favorably are the early adopters.Program planners should meet with them to learn how the \"new way\" shouldbe positioned and presented so as to best reach the entire community. Moreover,potential early adopters should be involved early on in program development.Typically, early adopters seek out information about innovations, while earlyand late majorities tend to wait for results of early adopters' experience beforetrying new ways themselves. Keep in mind that people may adopt a new health behavior at any stage in this process for reasons that are not health related. For example, they may want tobe seen as leaders, may want to please the change agent, may want to be part ofa stimulating social activity, or may want to do something important for theirchildren. Be prepared to modify program strategies to later reach the skepticallate majority and the resistant remainder. 281 PRINCIPLES AND METHODS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGEBe prepared to modify program strategies to later reach the skeptical late majority and theresistant remainder.51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 281EARLY MAJORITY Rogers (1995) characterizes the early majority as a group more deliberate and hesitant than those described above, but one that does not fear new things andis not blindly committed to old traditions. The early majority comprises aboutone-third of the population. Once won over, half of the target group will haveat least tried out the new way. The early majority are \"average folks.\" They prefer to observe an innovation until they know it works well, rather than accept it because science or localexperts say it will work well. The early majority has fewer connections with the outside world and is less willing to take a leadership role. Nevertheless, theyhave adequate education to accept the logic of the new way, once it has beenshown safe and practical. Social communication networks between early adoptersand the early majority will contribute greatly to the formal program, urgingacceptance of the new approach. LATE MAJORITY This group tends to have lower social standing, less education, and a more localoutlook. The late majority thinks concretely and skeptically, and has a less activesocial communication network. They may have been misled in the past and somay harbor some resentment of higher social groups; hence, they are skeptical.This group comprises roughly one-third of the community. By this stage, the in-novation program should have gathered enough momentum to continue spread-ing through the social channels of the first three change groups. At this point, thetime has come for program managers gradually to change the emphasis of thepublic education and motivation campaigns. Less attention should be given to ab-stract or scientific arguments and more to observable results. Testimonials aboutlocal people experiencing the high rewards, low cost, low complexity, trustwor-thiness, and flexibility of the new approach or behavior should be highlighted. Lo-cally popular figures and average citizens should deliver these messages. Respectedteachers, coaches, skilled athletes, and admired community opinion leaders havemore impact than do political officials or health professionals at this stage. The idea that about half the community is already doing the new thing and lik- ing it, and that more people are starting every day, adds to the effort's social mo-mentum, convincing the followers, the postponers, and the skeptics that it issafe to try the new way. After all, the sense of uncertainty about this new thinghas been dispelled. This is the time for health programming to change its mes-sage, but not to slow down. The late majority may have more health problems(higher prevalence or incidence) and so may be more helped by the innovationthan previous acceptors. The redirected program must help them to try the newway and to stay with it long enough so that they begin to see its benefits andfeel comfortable with it as part of their way of life. 282 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 282THE RESISTANT REMAINDER This 10% to 20% of the program's total target population is usually not actively opposed to the innovation, but they may not have been reached by the program;if reached, they may not yet be convinced. Many in this group are socially iso-lated, uninvolved in the rise and fall of community agendas. Moreover, they maynot even bother with mass media. They may be struggling just to keep their fam-ily going and may not have the money or the time to come to a health center,buy different food, or have plumbing installed in their homes. In the previouslydescribed programs to distribute free polio vaccine in Florida in the 1960s,young adults aged 20-40 years old who did not obtain the vaccine were mostfrequent among persons with few or no friends and who were not members oforganized groups, persons with low education or relatively unreached by localmedia, persons who had a greater degree of skepticism and fear of exploitation,and persons who said that none of their friends or family had participated in theprogram (Johnson et al., 1962; Northcutt et al., 1964). These categories havebeen found predictive of non-response to health programs in most research re-ports in the last 40 years. What can be done about this \"hard-to-reach\" minority? Control of some infec- tious diseases in a community can be achieved with only 70% to 80% coverage.This is due to a phenomenon known as \"herd immunity.\" But for other condi-tions, such as noncommunicable causes of sickness and death concentrated inpoverty-stricken sections of inner cities, it is necessary to redefine the com-munity as those persons living or working in the high-risk area. Among themcommunity-oriented programs can identify innovators and early adopters withwhom to develop culture-specific programs to reach the resistant group. Medical anthropologists are an important resource for any cross-cultural work. They can identify which key elements of beliefs, motives, and skills may needchanging, and by what social processes this can most easily be accomplished.They also can train local health workers. Many large universities have medicalanthropologists on faculty, and they can consult directly or provide the namesof past graduates. In developing countries, health leaders can request such a con-sultation from their ministry of health or request international agencies to helpfind a specialist. In summary, a group's willingness to accept and practice a new way of doing things\u2014for health or other goals\u2014and the speed with which the change spreadsto all parts of the community depends in part on the properties of the innova-tion and the way it is presented or marketed. An innovation's diffusion can beaccelerated if the target group perceives it has the following attributes, whencompared to the existing way of dealing with the problem: The new way is more rewarding. Show that the innovation gives better re- sults than the old way. Make it easy to understand. Help people to see the 283 PRINCIPLES AND METHODS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 283benefits of the new health behavior. If benefits are not perceived at the indi- vidual level, publicize reductions in the community's illness rates as they hap-pen. Use testimonials of local people. The new way should be less trouble and less costly. Does the new health behavior (by agencies or individuals) require less equipment, drugs, and ser-vices, than the old way? Will it require less time and effort; is it easier to do?Show how the new way is less expensive than the old way, and how it can betried with minimal risk, uncertainty, and anxiety. Emphasize whatever pointsof improved convenience are valid. The new way \"fits in\" with current local culture and social structures.Shape the innovation so it \"feels like it's OK\" with the group to be reached.Can the new way be carried out without creating social conflicts locally.Modify the new way if necessary, and present it so as to fit in with local val-ues, beliefs, and ways of doing things, then it will be promoted by the culturerather than resisted by it. The new way is flexible. It is not irreversible. The new behavior or system can be tried out, modified, or even discontinued without damage to thehealth system or community if it is not successful. It also can be updated overtime. The front-end costs of trying out the change in terms of money, insti-tutional commitment, and changed role functions are not overwhelming(these attributes are adapted from Oldenburg, Hardcastle, and Kok, 1997). STAGES IN HEALTH BEHAVIOR CHANGE Just as it is useful to know the stages that a community goes through in adopt-ing more healthful behaviors, programs can benefit from understanding the fivestages that an individual passes through in incorporating new healthful habits.This model, which was developed and tested by Prochaska and DiClemente, 1 applies primarily to long-term lifestyle changes, rather than to sporadic actionssuch as cancer screening. The model's five stages are as follows: Pre-contemplation. This is the stage at which individuals are not even con- sidering the idea of a change. Unfortunately, some persons remain always atthis stage. Contemplation. At this stage, people begin to think actively both about the health risk and the actions required to reduce that risk. The issue is now ontheir agenda, but no action is planned. 284 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH1Their publications can be seen in The American Psychologist, Health Psychology, and other sources from 1992 to the present.51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 284Preparation. At this point, contemplation moves into early action, such as de- veloping a plan, joining a class or group, and getting materials (new foods,nicotine gum, or self-help booklets). Action is planned for the coming month. Action. This stage is marked by observable changes in the health-related be- havior itself. The battle is under way. There may be relapses, but these shouldbe dealt with as part of the change process and not as an excuse to slide backinto contemplation. The action stage may go on for about six months. If suc-cessful, the person, or group, moves on to the less intense maintenance stage. Maintenance. At this stage the new health action needs to be firmly consol- idated as a permanent lifestyle. Prevention of relapse to the less healthy be-havior is essential. A return to smoking, alcohol abuse, or sedentary habits, orfailing to complete a series of immunizations, may erase all the progress fromearlier stages. Confidence and self-efficacy increase. Temptations to relapseare dealt with more routinely. The strategy of the health promotion program or the health counselor is to move groups and individuals forward one step at a time through the stages of change.Success will be unlikely if the health counselor tries to move a person from pre-contemplation to action in a single leap. The health planner or counselor shouldestablish where the individual stands in his thinking about the health changes andthen provide knowledge, motivation, and skills to move on to the next stage. Interms of smoking cessation, for example, repeating the list of all the diseases anddisorders cigarette smoking can cause will not help a smoker who needs help atthe action stage. Nor will maintenance skills help a smoker who is not interestedin stopping. Ask questions of individuals orgroups, or survey a community to determineat which stage of change (see 1 to 5 above)the majority place themselves. Determinethe barriers that keep them from the nextstep. Then work with them to overcomethose barriers. This model of the stages of change fits into the model of diffusion of innova- tion in the community. At any point during a community health promotionprogram, different people find themselves at different stages in the process ofchanging their behavior. At the beginning, most may be in pre-contemplation.As the program continues, however, more and more persons contemplatechange and others are ready for action. Early adopters, for example, may havealready adopted the change, while those in the late majority may not even beconsidering change. A family's position in the diffusion continuum is roughlycorrelated with its advancement along Prochaska's stages of change. This understanding has important implications for health promotion program- ming. The public communication and service delivery activities must move for- 285 PRINCIPLES AND METHODS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGEThe strategy of the health promotion program or the health counselor is tomove groups and individuals forwardone step at a time through the stagesof change.51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 285ward one stage ahead of the growth of the advancing innovation/diffusion cat- egories. As soon as 20%-30% of a population (which may be as small as oneneighborhood or one factory) is thinking about (contemplating) a new healthbehavior, the program should be teaching this group preparation for action andthe steps involved in making the change. At the same time, the program shouldcontinue to stimulate the remaining 70% to start considering action. However,that task should become much easier and less expensive because the natural flowof social interaction will spread the message from people already making thechange to the late majority. The messages communicated by the program should be separately conceived and delivered\u2014some to reach uninterested people; some to move contempla-tors to action; and, later, some to deepen the commitment of people who havealready changed to maintain their new attitudes and behaviors. The fact that inthe early 1990s in the United States, 90% of active smokers knew smoking washarmful, but had not decided to quit, reflects the failure of the country's pro-gram to move from merely informing to motivating and teaching the skills toquit. The models for stages of change and community diffusion of innovationtell us that one kind of message does not fit everybody. People whose thinkingis at a given stage of the change process require a message specifically tailored tomove them to their next stage. Education, after all, is but one leg of a three-legged stool. Without adding the other two legs\u2014motivation and skills train-ing\u2014a program's efforts are precarious, indeed. No matter what the characteristics of intended participants, the issues of per- ceived threat of the disease, perceived benefits and costs of the new health ac-tion, reduction of uncertainty, and increase in perceived self-efficacy and em-powerment must be taken into account (as explained earlier in this chapter).The treatment of each issue must be tailored to the belief and action system ofthe desired participants. In technologically advanced areas, many physicians have adopted the roles of scientist and decision-maker, and moved away from the traditional role of per-sonal healer. When it comes to changing health behaviors of individuals or com-munities, science provides theories and guidelines, but only a sensitive, enthu-siastic, personally involved guide can actually make behavior change happenand ensure that healthy changes are maintained. Since in our present world,changing human behavior is the superhighway to Health for All, perhaps a newdiscipline of interpersonally talented, behaviorally-trained health counselorsshould be created to serve this essential function. Community developmentfield workers, health aids, nurses, psychologists, and physician's assistants mayprovide the major pool from which this new profession can be selected andtrained. The gross anatomy of behavior change presented in this chapter will befleshed-out with specific examples for an array of different health promotion in-terventions in Chapter 13 286 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p273_306_r1 4/7/03 3:21 PM Page 28613. Getting Specific: Actions to Reverse the Most DestructiveRisk Forces This Handbook focused on the stages of the life cycle in Part II and on specific major disease outcomes in Part III. Throughout, it has offered lists of risk fac-tors and recommendations such as how to get people to stop smoking tobaccoor how to improve children's nutrition. Chapter 12 explained the principles andmethods of behavior change. This chapter puts together the easy-to-say, buthard-to-implement, recommendations (such as how to cut down the prevalenceof alcohol use in a community) and the principles of behavior change, and or-ganizes them around mega risk factors\u2014risk factors that operate around theworld and each of which produces multiple disease outcomes. Table 13.1 shows the burden of death and disability attributed to ten major risk factors according to the GBD Study (Murray and Lopez, 1996). The forces thatdamage health are extremely different in the developing world than in the in-dustrialized world. For developing nations, most of them impoverished, under-nutrition and lack of safe drinking water and waste disposal services are theleading killers. Along with sexually transmitted infections, they are the topthree causes of years of healthy life lost (Disability Adjusted Life Years, orDALYs). On the other hand, in industrialized nations\u2014those that the GlobalBurden of Disease Study defines as \"established market economies\" and \"for-mer socialist economies\"\u2014the leading mega causes of death are tobacco use andhypertension. Tobacco use and alcohol use are the leading disablers there. It should be kept in mind, however, that attributing death to various causes is somewhat arbitrary, especially when two or more pathologies are active simul-taneously. For example, there are fewer than 1,000 deaths attributed to under-nutrition in established market economies and former socialist economies. Andyet these deaths do occur, and by the thousands, among the poorest people inthese regions. DALYs estimates also are very loose. And yet, even though thenumbers may be only shadows of the reality, even a glimpse at shadows can re-veal whether a problem exists and something about its profile. MALNUTRITION Of all the destructive deprivations in human experience, starvation for food ranks second only to starvation for love. Food malnutrition can show itself inseveral forms. 287 GETTING SPECIFIC: ACTIONS TO REVERSE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE RISK FORCES51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 2871. Protein-energy Malnutrition. In this condition, there is not enough food of any kind for groups of people to maintain weight for extended periods.Protein-energy malnutrition is an academic label for starvation. 2. Specific Nutrient Deficiencies. This category includes such conditions as pellagra, beri-beri, iron deficiency, or iodine deficiency. In these cases, thereare enough available calories, but specific essential vitamins, minerals, oramino acids (from proteins) are missing. 3. Malabsorption Syndromes. These are associated with diarrheas, parasitic infestations, or other conditions that prevent the absorption of consumedfoods. 4. Overnutrition. This condition is due to an overconsumption of foods (es- pecially calories) far beyond what the body needs for growth and activity. Itis primarily a problem of post-industrialized areas, which are experiencingobesity epidemics, but it also can be found elsewhere in the world. By far the greatest contribution to premature death and continuing disability comes from the first three forms described above, and the three are intertwined.Where there is marginal starvation, there also are specific nutritional diseases. 288 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHTABLE 13.1.

Infections and parasitic diseases, in turn, cause malabsorp-tion syndromes. Even if previously adequate levels of food are made available atthis point, the bodies remain undernourished. Table 13.1 shows the burden of malnutrition on world health. The figures are calculated only from information on children undergoing degrees of starvation.The impact of undernutrition on adoles-cents and adults is admittedly both damag-ing and widespread, but quantifying it isdifficult (Murray and Lopez, 1996, p. 305).Despite this narrowed scope of data, mal-nutrition is rated as the leading cause ofdeath (nearly 6 million per year) and of disability. Poor nutrition in infancycauses retarded physical growth (stunting) and impaired neural development. Itopens the door wider to many childhood diseases, which leave organic andfunctional scars that remain detectable throughout life. Hunger contributes todeaths coded as infectious and parasitic diseases, respiratory infections, perina-tal conditions, and congenital anomalies, in addition to those directly coded asnutritional deficiencies. Hunger is the most active co-conspirator in millions ofchildhood tragedies each year. According to the Hunger Project's data (Hunger Project, 1985): there is enough food produced in the world each year to feed every living human and there is enough potential farmland as yet unused or inadequately used to in-crease production enough to feed all people even if moderate populationgrowth continues. Why, then, is it not getting to people\u2014predominantly children\u2014who are hun- gry? Economics and distribution problems are the main barriers. Corporationsthat produce foodstuffs require payment, as do those who transport and distrib-ute them. Actually, world hunger should not be blamed on famines, because theseare usually localized to part of a nation and limited to a year or two. Importationof stored foods from other regions could save famine victims, were it not for thosetwo barriers\u2014and the decisions not to use money to overcome them. World hunger has been a scourge for millennia, at least going back to Ancient Egypt. In this century, world hunger has been variously blamed\u2014sometimesconflictingly so\u2014on the world's capitalist economic system, or on a lack of acapitalist economic system in a given region, or on excess population growthdue to high birth rates, or on a lack of foreign food aid, or the presence of for- 289 GETTING SPECIFIC: ACTIONS TO REVERSE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE RISK FORCESHunger is the most active co-conspirator in millions of childhood tragedies each year.51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 289eign food aid that has fostered dependency. To try and deal with hunger, we have seen decades of international conferences, expert committees, books,United Nations resolutions, and draft programs. But after all is said and done,much more has been said than done. Although world hunger has pandemic health consequences, it is primarily a po- litical and economic issue. This is true among countries, as well as within coun-tries, inasmuch as most nations have within them a comfortable fraction ofoverly fed people and a larger fraction of chronically hungry persons. And yet,nations have it within their power to solve this global scourge. The technologyfor producing and distributing enough food for everyone on the planet has beenavailable for decades, in fact. The only thing lacking is the popular and politi-cal will of the people who have the power in their hands. DIAGNOSING AND TREATING HUNGER EPIDEMICS The following approach may help identify partial solutions for hunger at theprovincial, state, or metropolitan levels. Of course, the suggestions must be partof a comprehensive plan. 1.T reat hunger epidemiologically, as befits the disease that it is. Identify the host, agent, and the environment. Answer the Who? What? When? Where?Why? and How? of the situation. Identify the risk and protective factors thatseparate the hungry from the well fed\u2014and that separate the hungry poorpeople from the non-hungry poor people elsewhere in the country. 2.T race the flow of food from its place of origin (local or distant) to the target subpopulation that is malnourished. Are there adequate supplies elsewherein the country? In the province? In the city and its surroundings? Locate thedistribution barriers; the cost-barriers. How might each be overcome? Youmay need to consider an entirely different framework of possibilities thanpeople have previously used. Past ways of thinking did not solve the prob-lem then; they are unlikely to solve it now or in the future. 3.Consider how foods are being lost after harvesting through spoilage, expo- sure to insects and rodents, or due to theft and diversion. Encourage thecommunity to consider drying grains by using ventilating equipment or nat-ural means to prevent most spoilage, including aflatoxin which causes fatalliver diseases. Or suggest storing foods in screened areas or off the ground tohelp keep raw foods dry and safe from larger insects and animals. Storingcrops locally in small bins also may reduce both shipping and storage prob-lems. Remember that local farmers will keep closer watch to prevent spoilagethan managers of a centralized facility. Having checks and balances in ac-counting, storing, and shipping of foods should reduce diversions. Providing 290 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 290rewards for reporting instances of theft should reduce its frequency or make bribery too complex and expensive to be economically sensible. 4.Determine what crops can be grown under local conditions and support their production in family gardens. Once the techniques and skills for thosefoods are developed, larger scale production can be encouraged. The impacton local hunger will be substantial, because many people have been trainedhow to raise a food they have already learned to eat at home. Agriculturalextension workers will be needed to teach the new methods. They can beselected and trained from among the more enthusiastic local farmers. (Also see the section \"Spreading of New Health Behaviors through theCommunity\" in Chapter 12.) 5.Look for available fruits, vegetables, and grains that local people are not ac- customed to eating. In rural Puerto Rico a few years ago, farmers had grape-fruit trees, but allowed the cattle to eatthe fruit. They called grapefruit \"animalfood,\" and steered away from eatingthem, thus losing their nutritional ben-efit. Even now, many people in WesternEurope consider corn (maize) as animalfood. They continue to miss out on the joys and values of this delicious food.For centuries, tomatoes were thought to be dangerous to eat. Could there be some partial solutions to local hunger being trodden under- foot? Again, new learning is required. Very successful \"new food\" programshave used cooking classes and tasting parties to introduce foods. The socialcontext gives people the courage to try something new, and peer reaction en-courages a shared positive evaluation. New recipes for use of the new foodoften allow it to be prepared in a style similar to currently favorite foods andwith similar spices and sauces to make it look and taste more familiar andtraditional. 6.Can current practices for growing food be made more productive? Are there fertilizers available, such as animal dung, compost heaps of decaying grassesand leaves, wood ashes, crushed limestone, which could increase yields? Canbetter quality seed be provided? Would crop rotation restore worn-out fields?Would terracing, contour plowing, or erosion control keep cropland fromlosing its fertile surface? Are modern dry farming techniques being used inarid climates? Can limited seasonal rainfall be conserved behind earthendams or in local ponds? T rained agriculturists will be able to answer these questions, as well as ques- tions that are even more relevant for each local setting. There is an opportu- 291 GETTING SPECIFIC: ACTIONS TO REVERSE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE RISK FORCESAlthough world hunger has pandemic health consequences, it is primarily apolitical and economic issue.51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 291nity for intersectoral cooperation among agricultural specialists, community development agencies, and the health system. The above approaches cannot totally solve world hunger, but thinking and act- ing locally is a good start. The number 6,000,000 means little to most of us, evenwhen each one is a death from hunger that occurs each year. If we could see ourown children's faces in each of those 6,000,000 deaths, however, how differentthe impact would be. Communities that can see the faces of their own childrenamong hunger's potential victims may be the first to have the willpower to over-come hunger, working locally. (Also see the section \"Mobilizing the Com- munity\" in Chapter 12.) Perhaps some of the ideas given above will help in that effort\u2014at least until the cold, calculating iceberg of human unconcern melts. INADEQUATE WATER SUPPLY, SANITATION SERVICES, AND PERSONAL AND DOMESTIC HYGIENE Industrialized nations have these environmental and behavioral risk factors well under control, except in their areas of poverty. Frequently, rural areas in indus-trialized countries are not well served with drinking water and waste disposalservices either, but their low population density lowers the risk of disease out-breaks spreading there. In less developed nations and areas, however, these conditions rank as the sec- ond leading causes of death and of disability. The overall estimated burden ofhealthy years lost through death and disability (DALYs)\u201496 million personyears\u2014is particularly disturbing. CLEAN WATER SUPPLY Reasonably clean water is needed for washing, bathing, and cooking. Pure,boiled, or disinfected water is required for drinking. A. V. Whyte's guidelines(1986) are a particularly useful reference in regard to the community's partici-pation to facilitate the installation and operation of public works necessary fora safe water supply. (Also see the section \"Mobilizing the Community\" in Chapter 12.) Providing safe water does not always mean building purification and piped sys- tems. In some places, it may be enough to use currently available clean watersources and shut down those sources that cannot be cleansed. The low technology, highly logical processes used by the giant of epidemiology, Dr. John Snow, in London in the 1850s can be applied to many situations now.Every nation has its cadre of powerful logical thinkers whose help can be en- 292 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 292listed. The formula is to locate people who are getting sick, most of whom will be children (a spot map of the cases in the area helps greatly). Then, determinethe source(s) of the noxious agent. In infec-tions and parasitisms following the fecal-oral route, keeping those agents out of thefresh water supply will help solve the prob-lem. (Also see Table 2.1.) The job is not finished when safe water be-comes available. Many programs declaresuccess, but then the local people don't usethe safe water exclusively. They may con-tinue to use the former source because it is more convenient; because it tastesmore familiar; because they say, \"I drank it all my life and I'm alive and well\"; orfor other reasons. This is where health educators can help diagnose the behavioralresistance and teach and reinforce the healthier ways. (Also see Chapter 12.) 293 GETTING SPECIFIC: ACTIONS TO REVERSE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE RISK FORCESSAFE WATER MEASURES THAT A COMMUNITY MIGHT CONSIDER Provide pit latrines in safe locations convenient to currently used places for defecation. If a community uses a river as its water source, work to get all upstream dwellers to dump human, animal, and industrial waste in places that do not drain into the river. Dig new wells in safer places. Boil water that is to be drunk or used to prepare food. Use chemical additives such as chlorine to purify drinking water. Consult a sanitary expert for additional local solutions.Providing safe water does not always mean building purification and pipedsystems. In some places, it may beenough to use currently available cleanwater sources and shut down thosesources that cannot be cleansed. SANITATION The goal is to keep land, water, and air free of waste harmful to health. Major concerns are human, animal, industrial, and sometimes radioactive wastes. Social and behavioral change are the key to improving human waste disposal.As a rule, the sequence of development is as follows: (1) building privies; (2)using \"night later tobe dumped in the privies; (3) introducing septic tank systems (low-tech, nomoving parts); and, finally, (4) installing community underground sewagecollection and treatment systems. Many cities in developed nations makemoney from their sewage treatment facilities by selling fully dried sewagesludge as farm and garden fertilizer. Animal wastes can pose a problem on family farms if they are allowed to draininto the water supply. Large commercial farms raising livestock must bemonitored to prevent them from dumping large amounts of waste, thus pol-luting small streams and the rivers into which they flow. Relocation of waste51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 293lagoons, provision for longer filtration times, and relocation of water supplies all can help solve pollution problems. Industries and communities that generate waste must be responsible for con-trolling it safely. Many companies opt for maximizing immediate rather thanlonger-term profits, and fail to act in responsible partnership with the com-munities and the people around them. Hence, governmental regulations andtheir enforcement are required, if not for the current corporate residents, thenfor future ones that may not be such good neighbors. Sanitary and environ-mental engineers and public health experts can provide detailed guidance. All these steps to maintain a healthy environment help ensure safe water, thus preventing infectious, parasitic, and toxic disorders. They also assist in provid-ing clean air, thus preventing both pulmonary and cardiopulmonary diseases. PERSONAL AND DOMESTIC HYGIENE Hygiene leaves much room for improvement in every nation, no matter thelevel of development. Even in industrialized nations, some locations may beoverlooked\u2014nurseries and child care centers, which are at risk for the spread offecal-oral diseases; schools, where diseases can spread among non-immunizedchildren; hospitals, where iatrogenic infections are carried by workers' hands,bedding, ventilation systems, improper handling and disposal of medical wastes;nursing homes, especially around incontinent patients; and public eating places.But it is in the home\u2014where most of the people spend most of their time\u2014where most of the exposure to unsanitary conditions usually takes place. Handwashing The call of Ignasz Semmelweiss echoes across two centuries\u2014\"Wash your hands: more often and more thoroughly\"\u2014and still resonates with us today. A quicksoap rub and a flush of water was not enough to prevent childbed fever fromspreading through obstetrics wards, Semmelweiss found. He added chlorinated 294 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHTHE MESSAGE TODAY Wash adequately with anti-bacterial soap. Wash thoroughly. Wash after caring for each child or patient. Wash before handling food, beverages, or objects that must stay clean (such as eating utensils, toothbrushes, cloths for washing irritated, abrased, or wounded skin, any itemschildren might put in their mouths). Health care workers who have sensitive skin may need to wear latex gloves and change them or wash them thoroughly after each use.51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 294lime water to the washing process in the 1850s in Austria-Hungary, and required thorough handwashing more often. His methods stopped outbreaks of childbed(puerperal) fever in his day and still do wherever they are used. Food Handling Store foods in insect-proof, animal-proof, waterproof containers. Maintain food cleanliness when dispensing portions for immediate use. Keep clean surfaces onwhich food is cut up, mixed, or prepared; pots and pans in which it is cooked;and dishes and utensils with which it is eaten. Avoid unclean or spoiled foods. Household Cleanliness Keep the living space of the home cleaned of any materials that would attractinsects, mice, rats, etc. Keep domestic animals outside the house, unless they are trained not to defecate or urinate inside. Be careful that household animalsnot be carriers of fleas, ticks, triatomids, or other insects that can infect humans.If using insecticides, be careful not to spray them where food is to be exposed orchildren might handle sprayed objects. (Also see relevant text in the section \"From Birth through Age 4 Years\" in Chapter 3.) All these measures require changes in think- ing, in appraising (evaluating) circum-stances, and in behaving. To mass audiencesthese changes are best spread by changingsocial expectations and cultural patterns.Local mini-cultures exist in each hospital,school, day-care center, or family. Once in-corporated into a local group's cultural webof behaviors, hygiene practices will become second nature to the people involved.Again, incremental changes are the order of the day\u2014cultures are changed onemini-culture, one outpost, one family at a time. (Also see Chapter 12.) TOBACCO USE Tobacco-related diseases were responsible for about three million deaths world- wide in 1990, half of them occurring in industrialized nations, more than800,000 in China, and many more of the remainder in other parts of Asia. Inthe Americas, almost 15% of men's deaths and 7% of women's were attributedto tobacco (PAHO, 1992). By 1990, worldwide one person died every 10 sec-onds due to tobacco. Using the statistical projections of Peto and Lopez (cited in Murray and Lopez, 1996), tobacco mortality will rise rapidly, reaching about 8,400,000 deaths per 295 GETTING SPECIFIC: ACTIONS TO REVERSE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE RISK FORCESIt is in the home\u2014where most people spend most of their time\u2014where the greatest exposure tounsanitary conditions usually takes place.51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 295year by 2020. This means that the world is steadily moving towards being able to count one tobacco-related death every 3.6 seconds. More alarming, this figuredoes not include the many additional years of disability due to smoking and chew-ing tobacco, estimated at slightly less than 10,000,000 person/years (Years of LifeDisabled, or YLD) in 1990. Thus far, 43 carcinogens have been identified in to-bacco smoke. EFFECTS ON USERS As discussed in chapters 7 through 10, tobacco enters into the causal picture ofmany diseases\u2014ischemic heart disease, stroke, pulmonary heart disease, pe-ripheral vascular disease, cancers of the trachea, bronchus, and lung, head andneck, cancer of the bladder, cancer of the uterine cervix, peptic ulcer disease,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and emphysema. It also increases sus-ceptibility to respiratory infections, aggravates asthma, contributes to low birth-weight and developmental problems in babies whose mothers smoke duringpregnancy, and can lead to higher risk of infant respiratory disorders from second-hand smoke in the home. And the list goes on. Smoking raises the risk of fires in the home. Vehicle drivers who smoke are more likely to have crashes. In areas where birth control pills are commonly used,even stronger arguments can be made for women to stop smoking\u2014the com-bined biochemical effect of birth control medications and tobacco smokingmultiplies the risks of cerebrovascular strokes and myocardial infarctions inyounger women. Additionally, those who chew tobacco or use snuff put them-selves at high risk of cancers of the oral cavity. This practice is responsible forthe very high rate of head and neck cancers in India and other parts of Asia. EFFECTS ON NONUSERS Some smokers claim that their habit harms only themselves and that theyshould be allowed that freedom. This claim deserves rethinking, in light of stud-ies of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) conducted since 1985. These pro-vide further firm and ample proof that second-hand smoke at the relatively di-lute concentrations typically found in cigarette smokers' homes, workplaces,and places of entertainment has measurable toxic effects. Added up worldwide,this unintentionally inhaled toxicity exacts a huge price in damaged health ofchildren and nonsmoking adults. In Utero Maternal smoking during pregnancy has been solidly proven to be a common cause of low birthweight babies and premature births. Low birthweight, in turn, 296 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p307_350_r2 4/9/03 5:50 PM Page 296is a common intermediary for immature development, congenital anomalies, impaired future intelligence, and infant mortality. In industrial and postindus-trial societies, smoking contributes to infant mortality by doubling or triplingthe rate of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), depending on the durationof the mother's smoking. (For further information on intrauterine toxici- ties see the section \"In Pregnancy\" in Chapter 3.) In Infancy The damage from parental smoking continues through childhood. A mother or caretaker (such as a babysitter) spends much time in close contact with youngchildren, usually more than a father. As a result, her chemical impact generallyis greater than his. Infants raised by a mother who smokes regularly have aboutdouble the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). For a child whosemother smoked during pregnancy and during its first six months of breathingon its own, the SIDS risk is tripled. In Childhood In the second and subsequent years of childhood, ETS in the home or day carecenter has been found to be causally associated with an increased risk of lower res-piratory infections, such as bronchitis and pneumonia\u2014in the United Statesalone, between 150,000 and 300,000 addi-tional cases each year in children 1 to 18months of age are attributed to second-handtobacco smoke. This results in 7,500 to15,000 preventable hospitalizations per yearin that country. (The wide range of esti-mated cases is due in part to the changingnumber of smokers and the differences insmoke concentrations in various homes.) Moreover, since about 1985 a new finding has associated ETS with the preva- lence of children having fluid in the middle ear, leading to earache and avoid-able medical expenses. Findings regarding the effect of ETS on children's asthmaalso have been strengthened\u2014among children with asthma, both the severityand frequency of asthma attacks are increased. ETS is estimated to be harmfulto about 20% of the 2 to 5 million children with asthma in the United States.The personal suffering and financial costs of an extra one or two million avoid-able asthma attacks cannot be calculated. Corresponding data from other na-tions are not available, but probably correspond to the prevalence of tobaccosmoking in children's homes. In addition, ETS might bring on new cases ofasthma in children previously free of the disease, but the small number of stud-ies on this point are inconclusive. 297 GETTING SPECIFIC: ACTIONS TO REVERSE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE RISK FORCESInfants raised by a mother who smokes regularly have about doublethe risk of sudden infant deathsyndrome. For a child whose mothersmoked during pregnancy and duringits first six months of breathing on itsown, the risk triples.51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 297Of course, the premature death of a parent from a tobacco disease is socially and emotionally harmful to children and youth. In Adults Consider the following additional facts and estimates regarding ETS effects on nonsmoking adults (EPA, 1993 and WHO, 1997): The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has classifiedETS as a Class A carcinogen. ETS is the onlyagent rated as Class A by the EPA for which typical environ- mental exposures (not high-dose laboratory experiments) deliver measurablyincreased rates of human cancer. Evidence from 30 epidemiologic studies conducted in eight countries clearlydemonstrates a higher lung cancer risk among nonsmokers exposed to ETSthan those living in clean air. There is now such a preponderance of studiesshowing elevated risks of lung cancer due to ETS, that the statistical chanceof them all being wrong is less than 1 in 10 million. EPA estimates that ETS is responsible for about 3,000 lung cancers in adultnonsmokers in the United States each year. This is in addition to those lungcancers in non-smokers caused by occupational or smog exposures. ETS has subtle but clinically measurable effects on lung function, coughing,and phlegm production. T wo factors operate worldwide to spread the tobacco epidemic\u2014the powerful addictive properties of nicotine and the wealthy tobacco industries that buytheir way into developing areas. Tobacco industries market and advertise theirproducts with psychological skill, often targeting young people\u2014even chil-dren\u2014by giving away enough free samples to plant an addiction in many. THREE PREVENTIVE STRATEGIES Community and health leaders have three prevention levels available\u2014primor-dial, primary, and secondary. Tertiary prevention is useless for combating to-bacco addiction, because once tobacco diseases are fully present they are not re-versible. Stopping tobacco use, however, can halt further disease progress and,over time, allow rates of emergence of full clinical disease to decline. 298 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 298Primordial Prevention This level refers to prevention before the disease agent enters the environment. In another context, for example, this would involve the quarantine of all live an-imals seeking to enter a given area until they have been proven to be free of ra-bies. This represents primordial prevention of rabies in those geographic areas.The same principle can be applied to the importation or manufacture of to-bacco products, by banning their entry into a given area. This early preventionrequires strong political will, as well as the population's support to withstand theenticements of multinational tobacco companies and, sometimes, the pressuresof other governments. (Unfortunately, for some decades in the past, the UnitedStates Department of Commerce sought to force smaller countries to accept UStobacco products for local marketing.) If tobacco products cannot be kept out of a country or province, they can be taxed sufficiently to sharply limit their use by children and adults with less money. A second primordial prevention measure would be to make tobacco products more difficult to obtain. Requiring an expensive license for wholesale distribu-tion will drive up the price of tobacco products. In the United States, for exam-ple, there are laws in place that require proof of age (18 years or older) for pur-chasing tobacco products; they have reduced adolescent usage. Of course, youthcan get older friends to purchase cigarettes for them, but it still raises one morebarrier. Eliminating machines that sell cigarettes automatically raises another in-convenience. Each trivial barrier increases the effort (the costs) needed, andmakes the habit less easy. (Also see sections \"Overlapping Theories of Be- havior Change\" and \"A Sampling of Self-Directed Behavior Change Tac-tics in Chapter 12.\") Primary Prevention At this level, children are taught how to stay away from tobacco before they even begin experimenting with it. Just trying out cigarettes can start a slippery slidedown to addiction. These principles and sentiments should be taught from age2 years (when children might pick up cigarettes or butts) in homes and childcare facilities. This teaching is more effective if the adults involved do notsmoke, chew tobacco, or use tobacco products in any way. Schools, especially primary and secondary schools, hold great potential for pri- mary prevention of tobacco use among children and youth 6 to 18 years old.Governmental and nongovernmental health agencies have developed variouscurricula. Keep in mind, however, that curricula that simply give out health in-formation alone almost universally fail. Successful curricula include the teaching 299 GETTING SPECIFIC: ACTIONS TO REVERSE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE RISK FORCES51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 299of attitudes and providing counterarguments to reject invitations to try tobacco. These are reinforced most effectively by discussion and role playing among theparticipants. School curricula for tobacco prevention are available in most majorlanguages (The problem of childhood smoking, 1996). (Also see relevant text on tobacco in the section \"From Ages 5 through 14 Years\" in Chapter 3.) Secondary Prevention At this level, efforts involve getting tobacco users to quit an existing habit of smoking or chewing tobacco. The United States National Institutes of Health has supported this kind of behavior-change re-search for about three decades. It has been foundthat although many intervention programs canget a high percentage of smokers to quit for awhile, the critical test of a good program is howmany quitters abstain from tobacco for 6 or 12months after quitting. Skaar, Tsoh, McClure, etal. (1997) offer a comprehensive review of smok- ing cessation program evaluation and health care policy implications; Fiore, Bai-ley, Cohen, et al. (1996 or later) have a useful summary of clinical interventionguidelines. These sources agree that:1.Smoking cessation programs can be conducted by many kinds of profes- sionals and nonprofessionals, as long as they have had specific training andsupervised experience in the kinds of listening, teaching, group process, andproblem-solving involved. 2.Nicotine-replacement skin patches or chewing gum, where available and af- fordable, can be used for a short time to reduce nicotine withdrawal symp-toms and facilitate cessation. Patches or gum are relatively ineffective, how-ever, if used without concurrent behavior change group sessions. 3.Teaching the following messages is beneficial: (1) cessation programs do work, even if they do not work the first time, and (2) the program partici-pant has the ability to quit. Success is likely to come by following the pro-gram one hour at a time, rather than through vast amounts of willpower. 4.T reatment is more effective when the counselor: Is perceived as being understanding. Persons who quit successfully typ- ically report that their counselors were supportive, caring, and enabledthem to work out their own solutions. Counselors were not authoritarian, 300 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHSchools, especially primary and secondary schools, hold great potential for primary prevention of tobacco use among children and youth 6 to 18 years old.51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 300nor did they judge clients negatively. This encouraged discussion and problem-solving. Encourages expressions of feelings and concerns. Many clients are afraid that stopping smoking will lead to weight gain, for example. Coun-selors can reassure them that many studies show that some people gain noweight at all, and among those that do, the average gain is less than 10 lbs(4.4 kg). That can be lost later by increasing exercise. Counselors can alsorelieve clients' embarrassment over brief setbacks in their progress. Helps heavy smokers (more than 20 to 30 cigarettes per day) start atapering-off program. This involves smoking on a strict time schedule and lengthening the interval between cigarettes so that one-third fewer cig-arettes are smoked each successive week (Cinciripini, Lapitsky, Seay, et al.,1995). Encourages persons smoking fewer than 20 cigarettes per day to set a \"quit date.\" This is the day that will mark the start of their lives without to- bacco. The client will announce to family and friends that he or she will quiton that date, and is getting rid of all tobacco products, cigarette lighters, andashtrays from home or other places where he or she spends time. The coun-selor, family, and friends should all give additional social support and en-couragement from a few days before the quit date until about 10 days af-terward, depending on how well the person is coping with withdrawal. Maintains follow-up to reinforce cessation. Quitting smoking is easier than staying quit. Some die-hard smokers say, \"Quitting smoking is easy!I've done it 10 times.\" The counselor (or the anti-smoking program) isurged to follow every client, first weekly, then monthly, then quarterly fora year. This enables the program to be evaluated and identifies areas forimprovement. The \"stages of change\" behavioral model is well suited to the process of smok- ing cessation (Prochaska, Rossi, et al., 1994). (Also see Chapter 12 for fur- ther discussion and additional resources.) Even before the advent of psychologically-based intervention programs, people had been stopping tobacco use on their own. The United States Office of Smok-ing and Health in 1989 reported that in addition to the 25% of all regular smok-ers whose deaths are attributable to tobacco, enough living smokers quit smok-ing to reduce the prevalence of adult smokers in the country from 40% in 1965to 29% in 1987. At that time, nearly half of all living adults in the United Stateswho had ever smoked had quit. The downward trend appeared to be continu-ing in the 1990s. As a result of decisions never to start smoking or to quit, anestimated 750,000 smoking deaths were prevented. Similar preventive success 301 GETTING SPECIFIC: ACTIONS TO REVERSE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE RISK FORCES51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 301can be achieved in most nations. Mass media presentations of anti-smoking messages\u2014on television, radio, magazines, and billboards\u2014were deemed effec-tive. Some of these campaigns were paid for by taxes from tobacco sales. Countries, especially in the developing world, today have a great opportunity to prove wrong the predictions and projections of 8,400,000 tobacco-relateddeaths in the year 2020. This can be accomplished through aggressive, well-directed primordial and primary prevention targeted to children and youngpeople. If countries can raise a tobacco-free generation until age 25, by thenthose young adults will be at low risk for starting the tobacco habit. Keeping fu-ture generations smoke-free just for their first 25 years would save huge num-bers of lives and billions of currency units of unnecessary medical bills. Fur-thermore, the costs of maintaining such preventive programs would becomeincreasingly cheaper after tobacco advertising is stopped and fewer adults aremodeling self-destructive habits. Teaching materials and intervention program guides may be obtained from WHO in Geneva, Switzerland; PAHO; other WHO Regional Offices; mostnational ministries of health; and organizations working in health and health-related issues. UNSAFE SEX DISEASE BURDEN Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are estimated to be the third leading causeof disability and the seventh most common cause of death worldwide. Their im-pact is by far the greatest in economically less developed and transitional areas. 302 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHRECOMMENDATIONS FOR STRENGTHENING SMOKING CESSATION EFFORTS Based on reports from national and international agencies, a leader in pulmonary medicine has made the following medical and public policy recommendations (Hirsch et al., 1993): All forms of tobacco promotion should be prohibited. Increases in the price of tobacco products should exceed the rate of inflation, to dis- courage sales. Smoking restrictions in public places and workplaces should be extended. Public education and school teaching about the importance of tobacco as a major risk to health should be enhanced. All health professionals should offer smoking cessation advice in any consultation with smokers. More support should be made available to help workers stop smoking. Research should be funded to find more effective ways to prevent and stop smoking. Non-smoking should become the norm on all health care premises.51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 302On average, 685,000 people are infected every day with an STI (WHO, 1999). This adds up to about 250 million new infections per year, nearly as many as formalaria. T richomoniasis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, chancroid, and syphilis are themost prevalent infections. Sampling surveys in gynecology clinics in the UnitedStates of America report trichomoniasisprevalence rates as high as 50%. High preva-lences occur all over the world. In someplaces, the rate of gonorrhea infection is ashigh as 20% in adults coming to generalhealth clinics and up to 50% among com-mercial sex workers (Cates and Holmes,1986). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections and clinically apparent ac- quired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are sweeping through Sub-SaharanAfrica, Southeast Asia, and many other regions. HIV prevalence is difficult toestimate adequately, because many areas lack laboratory facilities to make the di-agnosis. In addition, adults infected with HIV can infect others in about fourmonths, yet may remain unaware of their disease until it starts showing signs orsymptoms, often as long as three to six years later. Furthermore, full national re-porting has political and tourism implications. Without question, AIDS is aworldwide epidemic. One of its more tragic expressions is the tens of thousandsof infants with infections acquired in utero, during the birth process, and/or lesscommonly from breast-feeding. Until now, the AIDS mortality rate has beennearly 100%. Unfortunately, new drugs to delay progression of such retrovirusesremain too expensive for use in many countries. More than 50 different STI syndromes have been recognized; they are traced to more than 20 infectious agents. The field is much more complex than it wasthought to be 40 years ago. Yet, by 1995, the teaching about STIs in medical uni-versities in the United States reportedly had dwindled to an annual average of onlyone hour per student. Health policy leaders may need to correct this deficiency inmany nations. However, new advances are continuing to be made with regard tomore efficient organization of STI services, more user-friendly delivery of services,less invasive diagnostic tests, improved antibiotic drugs, and better treatmentschedules. Finally, in some places modern behavior change methodology is be-ginning to be used. Perhaps the broadest research program evaluating clinical fieldtrials of state-of-the-art psycho-behavioral theory and practice is that conductedby the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.A.) through its Behav-ioral Interventions and Research Branch in the Division of STD Prevention. T raditionally, most STI training courses and published guidelines have focused on biological and administrative issues. Inadequate attention to prevention is-sues and failure to adapt and utilize modern psychological methods has tendedto limit STI efforts mainly to getting patients to recognize signs of disease and 303 GETTING SPECIFIC: ACTIONS TO REVERSE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE RISK FORCESEvery day, an average of 685,000 people are infected with a sexuallytransmitted infection\u2014which adds upto about 250 3:22 PM Page 303to self-refer for treatment. Another major problem is that STI services almost everywhere have been understaffed and underfunded. This Handbook offers the following arguments: STIs are social-behavioral in their etiology (cause and spread). They share many of the same psychosocial risk factors as injuries, violence, and alco-hol and drug abuse. (Also see section \"Major Health Problems at Ages 15-24\" in Chapter 4, and chapters 7 and 11.) STIs express themselves as infectious diseases. Primary prevention is better than secondary or tertiary prevention. For HIV/AIDS there is no secondary or tertiary prevention as yet. For chlamy-dia and gonorrhea that result in pelvic inflammatory disease, recognitionis often too late for any restoration of fertility. POPULATIONS AT RISK STIs are sneaky. Most are invisible. They hide among the poor, the rich, the young and old, and among persons of all races, all levels of education, and alloccupations\u2014even among nice clean-looking folks. You cannot tell by lookingor asking. Therefore, it is important to stress that knowing a prospective part-ner's group identification is far less important than knowing about their behav-ior. By far the most common way of contracting STIs is through sexual activity.Ranking second (for viral STIs such as HIV) is by sharing needles or syringes,mainly to inject drugs. Unborn fetuses are at high risk if their mother has anSTI; they can be infected during pregnancy, the delivery process, or afterward. Subgroups that tend to practice unprotected sex, and so are at high risk of car- rying STIs, include sexually active youth and young adults, people temporarilyliving away from home, men and women in the military, long-distance truckdrivers, rural migrants to urban areas, commercial sex workers, people using in-jected illegal drugs, and persons engaging in anal intercourse. It is important to inform people that ordinary social interactions\u2014shaking hands, hugging, sharing food together, using public toilets\u2014will not transmitSTIs, neither will insect nor animal vectors carry them. RISK FACTORS Failure to follow safer sex practices, especially a person's failure to protect him- or herself with barriers such as condoms every time sexual penetration occurs. 304 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 304Having unprotected sex with multiple partners. This is the most dangerous of all, because it multiplies a person's risk, by accumulating the risk each otherpartner incurred from all previous partners, and then passing it on to the nextperson involved. Having a sex partner who himself/herself has multiple partners. This is howone careful partner can be infected by a careless one. Changing one's sex partner from time to time. It adds a new set of contacts. Having sex with casual acquaintances whose background and prior sex habitsare not known well. These people may be harboring an STI! Having sex with commercial sex workers, including prostitutes or their clients. Having anal sex. Although there is danger in numbers, contact with a single person can bedangerous too, if that person is infected and the contact is not protected bya barrier such as a condom. THE MAIN PROTECTIVE FACTOR: THE BRAIN Contrary to what most STI guidebooks say, the primary protection againstthese infections, unwanted pregnancies, and all the troubles either can bring, isnot the condom, it's the brain. Handing out latex condoms and showing peoplehow to use them is part of primary preven-tion, but it must not be considered suffi-cient. Sexual behaviors begin long beforethe condom is unwrapped, and it is at suchbeginnings that the brain must be engagedin prevention. By the time the condom be-gins to be unwrapped\u2014provided this hasnot been forgotten in the excitement\u2014thebrain may no longer be functioning wiselyenough. The teaching of primary STI prevention in children should begin before they begin puberty. Middle childhood is a rational period for children, and many ofthem talk and act like small, sensible grown-ups. (This may well reveal the biasof an aging author.) Preventive teaching and participatory discussion need notbe sex education, which has vocal opposition in many subcultures. 305 GETTING SPECIFIC: ACTIONS TO REVERSE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE RISK FORCESHanding out latex condoms and showing people how to use them ispart of primary prevention, but it must not be considered sufficient.Sexual behaviors begin long beforethe condom is unwrapped, and it is atsuch beginnings that the brain must be engaged in prevention.51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 305Teaching can simply be oriented around making choices, emphasizing that the choices children and teens make can either build their futures or ruin them.Using street drugs, for example, can damage the body and the brain. Riding abicycle carelessly on a highway can break arms and legs, or worse. Getting in-volved with people of either sex in ways that bring fluids or sores near to or incontact with sexual organs\u2014or even with breaks in the skin\u2014can spread seri-ous or even occasionally fatal infectious diseases. These diseases can damage aperson's occupational future and his or her prospects for marriage or parent-hood. Fortunately, as is the case with other diseases or injuries, sexually trans-mitted infections can be largely prevented. Children need to learn how to avoidtrouble; how to make smart decisions; how to control impulses; how to dealfirmly and politely with pressures from friends; and how to continue steeringthemselves forward to a good life, not damaged by past immature mistakes.Girls especially need to avoid sexual risks, because as a rule they get hurt farmore seriously than their male partners. Girls can get pregnant and STIs canlinger long and do reproductive damage. CAUSES OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOR Human behavior follows systematically from its \"causes.\" If these causes can be identified and changed, the behaviors will change also. People enter into a newsituation or circumstance with predispositions for certain behaviors based onpast learning, motives, drives, and intentions or goals. The situation itself holdscues (signals that have meaning), and these cues prompt one of several reactions:to move toward, to move away, to oppose, or to ignore the objects and personsin the new situation. People differ so widely from one another in culture, past experience, personal needs, and ways of trying to get what they want, that no \"cookie cutter\" ap-proach will help even half the clients. This is not to say that in a group of 1,000persons each one has to be treated individually. However, there may be a dozenor so different categories of people in terms of motivations, habits, and ap-proaches to behavior change. To deal with these categories as efficiently as pos-sible warrants the development of flow-charts for behavioral treatment parallelto flow-charts to determine antibiotic treatments for STI syndromes. In thesame way that a single shot of penicillin won't cure every STI, a single set of in-structions, or one approach such as providing condoms, won't correct all sexualbehavior problems. Psychosocial Determinants What are some of the predispositions and needs that might lead adolescents and adults to be too hasty or careless about their sexual activities? 306 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 306Internal psychological drives: Adolescents may want to prove that they are grown up and independent. Some may use sexual intimacy to boost low self-regard (often true, but rarely self-reported). Sex may be used as a balm for loneliness or to fill an acute hunger for inti-macy. Youths may want to experience the thrill of sudden passion and sex with astranger. Mature adults may rely on sex as an assurance that they are still attractive andsexually competent. Sexual activities that build high excitement and discharge in orgasm delivergreat psychological reinforcement that creates a yearning for more. And thereare many forms of exciting, fulfilling activities\u2014sexual or other\u2014that are safe. Social pressures: Young people may engage in sex \"to be like their friends,\" \"to fit in.\" In fact, when large groups of high-schoolers are asked how many youth of their ownage engage in various presexual and sexual behaviors, they vastly overestimatethe percentages for each behavior, as anonymously self-reported by the samegroup. Young people may engage in sexual behavior to get the reputation of beingespecially \"sexy\" or popular. Adolescents and adults both may want to rebel against their families andchildhood value systems. Pressures to keep or save relationships: People may be afraid of losing a current partner unless they move quickly enough to full intimacy, at times including more risk-filled acts. Many people use sex activities to enhance and maintain a long-term rela-tionship. This approach to sex is usually safe, unless one partner is infected.If so, safe sex precautions should be used. Some people may trade sex for friendship or companionship. 307 GETTING SPECIFIC: ACTIONS TO REVERSE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE RISK FORCES51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 307Economic reasons: Some people may trade sex for favored treatment or other services such as help with work, quicker promotion, auto repair, or extra groceries. (The au-thor once counseled a divorced woman with two children who came to a pre-natal clinic. She explained her third pregnancy by saying, \"a mother has tofeed her children.\") Male and female drug abusers may trade sex for more drugs or money to buydrugs. In the desperation of withdrawal symptoms they will do almost any-thing for a drug fix. Drug addiction often progresses to intravenous drug in-jection, multiplying the risk of viral infection from shared needles and syringes. Of course, the prevention counselor should focus on modifying the motives and drives operating in specific individuals, couples, or groups, so that they can ful-fill their felt needs, such as those above, by safer and more constructive meansthan indiscriminant sexual behavior. Goals in STI prevention counseling include \"preparing the brain\" to deal wisely and safely with sexual possibilities. For many clients this involves strengtheningtheir sense of self-efficacy (\"I can and must guide my own destiny\") and level ofself-esteem (\"I am a worthwhile person who deserves good health and a fulfill-ing future\"). An approach that some counselors and group facilitators use to raise the sense of self-determination and self-value emphasizes that the human race has greatercapacities and responsibilities than do all animal species. Animals are prisonersto their instincts and urges, forced to act on impulse because they cannot thinkreflectively. Animals are hostages of their surroundings. Counselors and facilita-tors\u2014and their patients, clients, or students\u2014on the other hand, are part of theonly species that can work weeks to finish a painting, years to finish a book, andcenturies to build a cathedral. Humans can plan their lives and radically recon-struct their environment or move to new ones. Even those of us who cannot do things on such a grand scale can at least stop and think, manage our behavior, steer clear of danger, and look far enough for-ward not to swap an hour of (what one hopes will be) fun for years of trouble,regret, or unplanned responsibilities. Only by caring for themselves and theirloved ones\u2014constantly and thoughtfully\u2014can humans keep themselves free.Mother Nature does not forgive. These may seem like unattainable dreams for impulsive teenagers or deprived adults, but we all carry the instinct to move on up a little higher. Counselors canpresent a client with a personalized vision of where he or she now stands, and 308 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 308calibrate it to fit the client and the social environment. This may also entail re- defining which way is \"up\"\u2014which is the direction toward which to grow. For the other personal needs and desires listed above, there are healthier solutionsthan unsafe sex to meet psychologicalneeds, to make a social statement, to firmup a relationship. Counselors should try toguide clients into better ways to meet theirspecific needs and resolve their concerns. The STI counselor's job is not to change clients' personalities or world view, nor to solve their deep conflicts. Rather, the counselor should offer better andhealthier ways for clients to get what they want. Ideally, the newly adjusted be-haviors will meet the true underlying hungers and needs as well as did the oldbehaviors (the reward side), but with much less danger of disease, disability, ordeath as the old behaviors (the cost side of the equation). Social Environmental Determinants So far, this chapter has reviewed some of the predispositions, intentions, needs, and reasons\u2014both true and false\u2014people carry with them as they travel throughtheir environments. Those environments, too, are essential determinants ofwhether sexual activity will take place or not, and if so, the likelihood that it willbe safe. Throughout history, families and communities have controlled the physical and social environments of fertile females and males so as to minimize the number ofpregnancies outside of sanctioned couples. Society also imposed harsh taboos onsame-sex partners. As a byproduct of this societal control, the spread of STIs alsowas kept in check. For example, traditional systems kept youths and young adultsliving in their families' homes until marriage and, as a rule, the sexes lived in sep-arate quarters in schools, colleges, and even in many factory towns. Moreover, thepractice of chaperoning unmarried young women was widespread and acceptedas the norm in most Hispanic, Arabic, Asian, and some European cultures. Withthe rapid worldwide spread of individual and sexual liberation since about themiddle of the 20th century, however, the controls began to erode\u2014as the risingbirth rate to unwed mothers and the pandemic of STIs amply demonstrates. The fact is that, with the new sexual and individual freedoms, the responsibil- ity for safer sex has shifted more to the individual, rather than society. Today,more and more individuals \"control\" the environments they select\u2014and theycan select safe or risky ones. STI prevention should work to replace risky cir- 309 GETTING SPECIFIC: ACTIONS TO REVERSE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE RISK FORCESThe STI counselor's job is not to change clients' personalities or worldview, nor to solve their deep conflicts.Rather, the counselor should offerbetter and healthier ways for clients to get what they want.51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 309cumstances with safer ones. Even if low self-esteem or sexual hunger cannot be counseled away, they won't result in unsafe sex unless the environment providesa partner. Some examples of \"environmental safety\" that a counselor can sharewith a client include: Avoid frequenting pick-up bars, places where single persons go to drink alco-hol and find someone new for intimacy. Avoid parts of town where commercial sex workers wait for customers. Socialize mainly with groups where sexual activity (regardless of sexual orien-tation) is unlikely or impossible; for example, groups of monogamous cou-ples, groups sponsored by religious or ethical organizations, or groups so com-mitted to specific purposes and projects that \"sexual cruising\" is unlikely. Avoid circumstances where alcohol or street drugs may numb one's brain sothat wise decision-making is hampered. Avoid situations where narcotics are being injected. Avoid patronizing places where tattooing or body-piercing is done, unless youcan determine yourself that needles or lancets have not been used before andare opened from sealed packages, or witness a thorough sterilization processconducted. Don't accept verbal assurances. Obtain health care only at first-class medical facilities where strict sanitationis practiced, including boiling and/or chemical disinfection of all instruments that pierce the skin, careful soap scrubbing ofworkers' hands, or the use of fresh sterile gloves asa worker moves from one patient to another pa-tient (especially when examining body openings). All behavior requires both a predisposition (con- scious or unconscious) and an enabling environ-ment (including environments that change inten- tions). Therefore, keeping people out of sexually enabling environments andcircumstances is one effective way to reduce unsafe sexual behaviors. AN UNHURRIED DECISION-MAKING PROCESS Counselors must stress the importance of taking time to make reasoned deci- sions about sex. Decisions about sexual behavior should not be made in athoughtless rush. As to \"life and death\" decisions, a quick \"no\" just might mean 310 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHWith the advent of new sexual and personal freedoms, the responsibility for safe sex has shifted away from society and toward the individual.51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 310life, but a quick \"yes\" just might risk death. Good sex will wait, and mutual an- ticipation might make it better. The safest of all sexual behaviors, as many reli-gious and ethical systems teach, is abstinence. The only preventive material aperson needs is that wonder drug, \"self-control.\" Don't leave home without it. After the informed, thoughtful, and well-controlled brain is engaged, there may be no need for the \"latex reflex.\" One way to give the brain\u2014and the develop-ing personal relationship\u2014more time is for the client to say something like,\"We really don't know each other very well. Let's take a few more occasions toget to know each other better.\" Clients will then have gained time to changetheir minds or realize that they may not be ready for sex with the other person.The bottom line: if a person waits, the risk of acquiring an STI or getting preg-nant is zero. If an informed brain that is conscious of the future and in control has post- poned for more thought and then still decides to proceed with intimacy, and thesocial environment enables intimacy to take place, the following measures canbe used to considerably reduce risk, but they will not totally eliminate it. Counselors should encourage clients to:1.Develop enough mutual openness to discuss the potential partner's STI sta- tus. Determine how long ago each party was tested for STIs. Ask about anypost-test exposures. 2.Consider engaging in intimacy without penetration. This can be a fully sat- isfying experience and learning to do it well can, in itself, be fun. 3.Unobtrusively examine the partner around the genital area, looking for any rashes, ulceration, pimples, sores, or warts that may reflect the presence ofsyphilis, chancroid, herpes (a virus that keeps recurring and is spread byskin-to-skin contact), or genital warts (condylomata acuminata) caused byhuman papilloma virus (HPV). If some of these skin lesions are not coveredby a latex condom and come in contact with uncovered skin they can infectthe other partner. This is, of course, a signal that the person so marked has one or more STIs and probably has failed to receive adequate treatment.There is also major risk of oral infection if the mouth contacts such sores. Beaware, however, that a prospective partner already may be seriously infectedand yet not show any obvious signs. Chlamydia rarely shows external signs,and most other STIs have extended periods without signs or symptoms in-cluding AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea, human papilloma virus (HPV), and oth-ers, including trichomoniasis, which is the most common of all STIs inmany areas. 311 GETTING SPECIFIC: ACTIONS TO REVERSE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE RISK FORCES51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 3114.Be alert (by looking, touching, asking) for any STI signs that form the basis for the \"syndrome approach\" to treatment, especially: abnormal discharge from the vagina or penis, especially if it has an atypi-cal color or smell; irritation or pain while urinating (either gender); pain, tenderness, or swelling of the scrotum; lower abdominal tenderness or pain (either gender); tender or swollen lymph glands in the groin; and skin sores or ulcers (asdescribed in the third bullet above). If signs and symptoms such as those mentioned in items 3 and 4 are found, the observer should urge the prospective partner to go for diagnosis andtreatment, both for his/her own sake and for the sake of others. The personlearning about these symptoms should not proceed with intimate contactuntil antibiotic treatment is completed. Home remedies and folk medicinesdo not get rid of sexual infections! 5.Use a barrier protection (condom) or avoid contact if he or she has mouth sores or a tendency to bleeding gums, because a person can be infected byhaving oral contact with a partner's infected skin, sexual organs, or fluidsfrom them. 6.Use latex condoms or similar fluid-tight barriers correctly (health workers can explain this) every time and throughout the exposure. This protects aperson from invisible infections and from incubating infections that the part-ner may not even know about, but which are nevertheless catching. They arethe best protection, even if one makes an error in selecting a partner. 7.Before having unprotected/risky sex with anyone, go together to an STI clinic for laboratory testing to make sure you are both free of infection. Bothpartners' safety will continue as long as they are mutually monogamous. PRIMARY PREVENTION The goal of primary STI prevention is to keep infections from ever happening.Primary prevention must be taught not only to persons already sexually active,but also to those who expect to become sexually active. The public must bereached respectfully, but effectively, with health preserving STI messages. Keepin mind that fear-inducing communications have been shown to be ineffective 312 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 312in preventing STIs. They probably scare as many people away from clinical care as the number scared away from sexual behavior. Mass media information about STIs sets the agenda for people's conversations. But the mass media in many places send the wrong messages: that sexual urgesusually turn into sexual behavior, that\"everybody is doing it\" casually, withoutprotection, uncontrollably. The media im-plies a standard for usual behaviors uponwhich persons \"new to the scene\" can settheir expectations. The first goal is tochange the portrayal of sexuality in films,television, and the print media, and to getthe mass media to be socially responsibleand health-promoting. However, even ifthis can be achieved, media messages are unlikely to change people already en-gaging in unsafe habits. That is most effectively achieved in personal discussionsamong peers, between partners, or with a counselor. Primary prevention of STIs has never received adequate attention at the na- tional level, perhaps worldwide. Recently, well-conducted primary preven-tion efforts have worked wonders in reducing the incidence and prevalence of scores of diseases and disorders. Could the traditional impotence of primary STIprevention programs be responsible for some\u2014maybe even for most\u2014of the250,000,000 new cases in the world each year? On the 20th century's medical bookshelf dealing with STIs, most publications do not touch on primary prevention. Most seek only to treat active STIs andteach early self-referral for repeated treatment. Is this public health specialtyready to try out the established strategies using psychological methods forbehavior change in clinical trials? SECONDARY PREVENTION Secondary prevention of STIs also is within the scope of this Handbook, be-cause secondary prevention in one partner can (and should) be primary pre-vention for the other. There are urgent reasons for the prompt identification andeffective treatment of STIs: If untreated or untreatable (as is the case of sexual viruses), infections easilyspread to other persons through sexual contact. If untreated or untreatable, the agents can multiply and spread to other or-gans within the patient, often causing serious damage. Chlamydia trachomata 313 GETTING SPECIFIC: ACTIONS TO REVERSE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE RISK FORCESThe goal of primary prevention of sexually transmitted infections is tokeep infections from ever happening.Primary prevention must be taught to persons who are already sexuallyactive, but also to those who expect to become sexually active.51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 313has no symptoms in its early stages in more than half of infected men and women. Only later does it produce symptomatic inflammation. It may causeinfertility or ectopic pregnancy in women. Syphilis, now becoming epidemicagain in some areas, can result in damage to many organs including the brain,and can cause death if not adequately treated. Untreated STIs can damage the mucous membranes and the skin near theirportals of entry\u2014the genitals, mouth, or anus. This damage opens the systemto other infectious agents, particularly HIV. Thus, prompt STI treatment isan important aspect of preventing AIDS, as well as a host of other STIs. Gonorrhea infection in pregnancy is often transmitted to the baby's eyes dur-ing vaginal birth. This infection can lead to blindness if not treated promptly. Counseling, advising, and motivating the patient being treated for a current STI has five personal goals. The counselor's task is to enlist the patient in sharing re-sponsibility to achieve them: 1.Get the infection cured; 2.Don't spread this infection, or any other STI; 3.Help your partners get treatment; 4.Come back to the clinic to make sure your infection was cured; 5.Stay cured\u2014prevent another infection\u2014by engaging only in safer sex. If a woman is pregnant or expecting to become so, she has a sixth goal\u2014pro- tecting her baby. SUGGESTIONS FOR STI COUNSELORS Experienced STI workers will realize that the above goals for changing behaviorsrepresent an overly idealistic scenario for both primary and secondary preven-tion. Clearly, only parts of the total inquiry and parts of the recommendationscan be covered in a single meeting, especially if the client/patient is given ade-quate time to discuss the problems and become part of their solution. Clientswho are not adequately helped the first time will be back again and again, withinfections and reinfections. At a return appointment it is better to take moretime than is available\u2014more time, in fact, than the counselor can or should\u2014to make that \"personal connection,\" repeat messages, praise progress, or try newapproaches. In the long run it is more cost-effective to take an extra hour or twowith a reinfected patient, particularly if he or she has new contacts and is in- 314 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 314fecting others. Remember, the patient's knowledge is not the goal\u2014behavior change is! Counselors constantly practice the \"art of the possible.\" They negotiate the steps that clients reasonably can do, given their mental, emotional, and circumstantiallimitations. For example, a client should not be asked to stop all intercourse. Theclient will hear only enough of that to decide that you are unrealistic. A reduc-tion in the number of partners could be negotiated, however. Start with the fullpartner list and negotiate how the client caneliminate some persons and not add newones. Even commercial sex workers mightlearn to be more restrictive, by insisting onpracticing only safer sex, or by avoidinghigh risk situations, such as working withbelligerent or drugged clients. These are ex-amples of risk behavior negotiations. Followthis by an agreement between client andcounselor\u2014a verbal contract\u2014as to what the client promises to do. Then set anappointment in a week or two for him or her to come back, give a progress re-port, be checked for symptoms, and perhaps get an updated behavioral prescrip-tion. Clients should be welcomed to return to the same counselor for support.There must be good reasons to return, especially without a reinfection! Behavior change need not be limited to one client at a time. Create opportu- nities to work with groups, such as military units with above average infectionrates, wives who have been infected by husbands who use commercial sexworkers, commercial sex workers in a given geographic area, groups of adoles-cents or students in school dormitories. In all these situations, group interac-tions, the sharing of problems and solutions, and the support of similar peo-ple, can be captured and directed toward self-empowerment, and from thattoward behavior change. Several theoretic models of behavior change are nowbeing field tested with encouraging results (Fisher et al., 1996; Kalichman etal., 1999). The group process, guided by a knowledgeable counselor, usuallyhas more enduring persuasive power than a counselor working with individualclients all week long (also see Fishbein, 1998 and Kamb et al., 1998). (Review the many points in Chapter 12 and see how they can be applied to STIprevention.) RESTRUCTURING STI OUTREACH New strategies for delivering STI services have been urged over the past decade. T raditionally, STI services have been delivered in separate clinics devoted to thiscategory of disease. Typically, these clinics have been located in old run-downbuildings in dangerous parts of the big city. Anyone seeing a patient walking in 315 GETTING SPECIFIC: ACTIONS TO REVERSE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE RISK FORCESIn the long run it is more cost-effective to take an extra hour or two with areinfected patient, particularly if he orshe has new contacts and is infectingothers. The patient's knowledge notthe goal\u2014behavior change is!51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 315such an area might suspect where he or she was going and why. The separate- ness and isolation of STI clinics hints to the insightful observer that at some un-conscious level health officials may have suspected that STIs could be spread toother patients with more \"acceptable\" problems through the waiting room. Per-haps they seek to quarantine the shame they impute to STDs. Such categoricalclinics miss seeing the greater majority of persons who need their care, largelybecause they don't know they are infected. The new approach recommended by WHO and other health organizations and groups is to incorporate STI screening and treatment into general health ser-vices, such as family medicine, obstetrics (for prenatal care), adolescent clinics,occupational health, and hospital admissions routines. The benefits are clear: Sharing clinic and laboratory facilities and staff cuts costs. T reating STI patients like all seekers for other health care destigmatizes their plight. T reating patients as whole persons, possibly having multiple health careneeds, not just as a \"case of disease X.\" Reaching people who come to the clinic for other reasons, which presentsgreat opportunities for screening. Prenatal screening for women facilitatesprimary prevention for neonates. And it is convenient, convenient, convenient. (Also see Chapter 12.) NEWER STRATEGIES FOR EFFICIENT TREATMENT The same new approaches to diagnosis and treatment of STIs are being pro-moted by many international agencies. For example, since many STI patientscome to a facility only once for diagnosis, never returning for treatment orfollow-up, the strategy is to accomplish as much treatment as soon as possible,even in the first visit. This same new approach works well in settings with lim-ited diagnostic capabilities (some clinics may not even have a microscope) andwhere there is a shortage of STI-trained physicians. This new clinical system is called the \"syndrome approach.\" Specific combina- tions of STI symptoms follow infection with one or more pathogens. These eas-ily distinguished combinations are used to identify an appropriate treatmentplan, which is provided to the patient immediately. The combinations includethe following: 316 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 316vaginal discharge in women, urethral discharge in men, genital ulcer disease in men and women, swollen scrotum, certain lower abdominal pain in women (for pelvic inflammatory disease), and swelling of inguinal lymph nodes (bubos). The syndrome approach is more efficient for the patient, stops transmission of the pathogen by the patient without waiting an additional week, and is cheaperfor the clinic in the longer term. The separate stage of confirming the diagnosisby laboratory results is omitted. This omission results in treating some patientswith more drugs than they actually need at that time, but it also eliminates prob-lems of laboratory error and well suits those many patients with multiple con-current infections. The syndrome approach also permits trained health workerswho are not physicians, as well as physicians not trained in STIs, to follow flowcharts leading from presenting symptoms, to history of present episode, to phys-ical examination, to administering the most appropriate drugs. Textbooks and guidebooks for implementing this system are available, and will soon be further translated and more widely distributed. The following wereavailable at the writing of the Handbook, and seem to be comprehensive. WHO STD Case Management Workbook. Geneva, 1999-2000. Control of Sexually Transmitted Diseases. Edited by G.

However, many deaths involving alcohol are codedas trauma in the workplace, highway deaths, drownings, liver cirrhosis, homi- 317 GETTING SPECIFIC: ACTIONS TO REVERSE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE RISK FORCESPreventing and treating alcohol abuse may go forward more effectively if thecondition is not classified either as amoral weakness or a psychiatricproblem, but instead as a separatecategory of concern.51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 317cide, and other outcomes. In addition, alcohol ranks as the second largest cause of disability in industrialized areas, and the fourth largest disabler in the devel-oping world. Alcohol is a major disabler of local economies because it mostly attacks working age persons. In addition, it destabilizes their families, thus damaging communi-ties. The economic costs of lost production; accidents on the job, on roadways,and at home; medical care for acute episodes and chronic alcohol diseases, all addup to a huge burden. Alcohol behavior is culturally determined, as is the priority accorded for its pre- vention and treatment. Ethical and religious issues create conflicts and stigma.Perhaps preventing it and treating it will go forward more effectively if the con-dition is not classified either as a moral weakness or a psychiatric problem, butinstead as a separate category of concern, which the community should begin ad-dressing now for the benefit of the next generation. (Issues regarding the con- tributing causes to alcohol abuse, screening for overuse, and possiblepreventive interventions are presented in the section \"Major Problems atAges 15-24 Years\" in Chapter 4 and in the section on \"Consumption ofAlcohol\" in Chapter 5, and the section \"Alcohol Abuse and Dependence\"in Chapter 7.) HYPERTENSION Elevated blood pressure is almost always free of unpleasant symptoms. It re- mains a secret to those who have it. Nevertheless, it causes enough heart diseaseand cerebrovascular crises to be ranked as the second leading force of death inindustrialized nations and third in developing areas (following only hunger andlack of sanitation). See Table 13.1. Hypertension contributes to several forms of cardiovascular disease, including ischemic, pulmonary, hypertensive, and congestive heart failure. (The defini- tion of hypertension, its causes, and ways to treat it are discussed morefully in the section \"Hypertension and Hypertensive Heart Disease\" inChapter 8.) Of great potential for developing areas are the five nonpharmaco- logic behavior changes, each of which can help lower blood pressure to some ex-tent, thus helping to prevent serious disease. Again, the population interventionapproach applies. This means that lowering the average blood pressure in a pop-ulation of adults will usually save more lives than treating all the hypertensives. OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH HAZARDS Occupational health is declining in the world's developing countries. This comes at a time of increasing unemployment and factory closings in many places. Oc- 318 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 318cupational exposures are one remediable cause of disability among 15 to 64 year olds, the economically critical age group. Attracted by the lure of cash-paying jobs in the big cities and the hopes for a higher standard of living that such cash can buy, men migrate away from sub-sistence farming to magnet urban centers, only part of the time bringing theirfamilies along. The supply of workers is far greater that the supply of jobs, how-ever, which leaves millions unemployed or underemployed. It was estimated thatin Central and South America alone there were 10 million unemployed workersin 1990 and 78 million more working only part-time (PAHO, 1994). Further-more, economic depression and monetary inflation in the 1980s and 1990s havelowered current wages in many nations toequal only 66% of the buying power thesame amount of money had in 1980. In ef-fect, wages have gone down for most work-ers (PAHO, 1994). These occupational prob-lems affect both men and women. In most countries at early stages of development, workplace health and safety are generally not controlled by the government or by the industries themselves.At first glance this might seem to lead to greater profit for management. Butconsidering the estimated 95 million workdays lost to occupational injuries andillnesses each year in the developing nations of the Americas alone, this may notbe true (PAHO, 1994). In addition, mortality rates for work-related acci-dents\u2014even considering the fact that they are underreported in most develop-ing countries\u2014already slightly exceed the rates in developed countries, whichhave safety standards. The leading causes for this damage to people and productivity are: Chemicals. These include carbon disulfide, vinyl chloride, benzene, arsenic compounds, organophosphates, pesticides, fumes from solvents, fumes fromcoal and gas refineries, smoke from cigarettes, soot, tars, and many others. Metals. Metals can be free or in unstable compounds. The most toxic include lead, chromium, mercury, cadmium, beryllium, nickel, and fumes from smel-ters. Population exposure to lead may be the most widespread of these. Particulates floating in the air. These can include asbestos, dust from cotton and other fibers, coal, silica, lime, agricultural dusts, particulates in smoke,smog, and chemical spraying. Gases. These include carbon monoxide from incomplete burning or fumes from industrial processing such as refining, which give off hydrogen sulfide,sulphur dioxide, and fluorocarbons. 319 GETTING SPECIFIC: ACTIONS TO REVERSE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE RISK FORCESIn the developing nations of the Americas alone, there are an estimated 95 million workdays lost to occupational injuries and illnesseseach year.51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 319Ionizing radiation. Such ionizing radiation may come from inadequately shielded nuclear fuels and wastes, and from fabrication of products containingradionuclides. Even inadequately shielded X-ray equipment can be a danger. Machinery. This is especially true when equipment is operated by unskilled hands, lacks proper protection, or lacks proper maintenance. Of particulardanger are trucks; power lifts; road-building equipment; cutting, stamping,drilling machines; farm machinery that cuts or chops; and mining equipment. Acute trauma. This can be caused by falling objects or when workers fall, es- pecially in construction trades, as well as impacts from moving objects, heat,or steam. Lifting heavy objects without proper training or assistance is an-other factor. Repetitive motion injuries. These have emerged from work on assembly- line machinery and at computer terminals. They occur when the same rela-tively small movements are made thousands of times in a day. Proper ergono-mic design for the task and support for affected body parts can relieve muchof this. Impact vibration and excessive noise. Repetitive impact causes muscu- loskeletal problems; intense noise causes permanent deafness. Working withhand-held mining and highway construction machines or near airplanes andloud machinery are examples. Proper body cushioning and ear protection canhelp. Child and adolescent workers are more susceptible than adults to allthese insults. (Also see the section \"Nurturing the Seeds of a Healthy Future\" in Chapter 4.) Violence . The workplace is a social setting, and as such, interpersonal and work stresses often are at play. In recent years, the leading cause of death forwomen while at work in the United States has been homicide. Acts of assaultare generally not recorded, but no doubt are a major issue throughout bothdeveloped and developing countries. (Also see the section \"Suicide and Violence\" in Chapter 11.) With such a varied list of dangers, where should initial efforts be focused to im- prove occupational health? Good spots to consider first are those activities andplaces that have the highest frequencies of medical care needs and days lost due toinjury and illness (per 1,000 person-days of work). T wo other ways of setting pri-orities for initial efforts are to target the hazards to which the greatest number ofpeople are exposed, or to turn first to the hazards that are most easily correctable. The list of \"pathogens\" and dangerous work above gives health workers dealing with occupational health and management (including family farmers) a check- 320 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 320list of ways to promote both healthy workers and healthy production. Only a handful of industries are responsible for an alarming share of occupational dis-eases and mortality. In most countries, the construction, mining, and metal pro-ducing industries are the most dangerous. Refining and dust-generating facto-ries and mechanized farms also present dangers that can be lessened. Workers hardest hit with occupational hazards appear to many to be the first generation exposed to each technological advance, be it mechanical, chemical,physical, ergonomic, or a new kind of process-chain whose side effects are notfully understood. Adequate job training of able and mature trainees, plus safetyengineering for handling raw materials, machinery for processing, and end-products should greatly remediate occupational dangers. Regulations alone can-not achieve these goals without full affirmation at all levels of management thatthe workers are the living building blocks both of this industry and their com-munity. They are not merely raw materials to be used up and replaced. PHYSICAL INACTIVITY/SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE Industrialization and automation take much of the physical labor out of occu- pational work. This has several advantages\u2014fewer people can accomplish morework in less time; skilled people can have longer careers, not shortened early bydiminished strength. Populations in developing areas yearn for these advancesto reduce the sweat of their brows. In post-industrialized areas, however, the dark side of these advances is a grow- ing population who remain sitting most of their waking hours. A person'sbody\u2014even someone's psychological adjustment\u2014deteriorates relatively quicklyunder such conditions. As discussed in Chapter 6, \"The Older Years: 65 to 100,\"humans must either use all their capacities or lose them. Physical, mental, andsocial activity are vital to personal well being at every age. Sedentary lifestyle ranks third as a risk for mortality and fifth among the pre- cursors of disability in the post-industrialized world. It is much less frequent incountries at earlier stages of economic development. Calculations of the attrib-utable risks for ischemic heart disease (IHD) in the United States in the 1980sfound that physical inactivity made the single largest contribution to mortality.Sedentary people have an IHD risk much less than double that of actively work-ing or exercising people (when other risks are controlled), whereas people whosmoke or have high LDL cholesterol may each have triple or greater risk. Theextremely high prevalence of \"sedentarism,\" however, multiplies the individualrelative risk into a community burden that is very large indeed. Thus, preven-tion at the community level, wherever the diseases fostered by inactivity consti-tute a problem, should make it a priority to increase daily physical activity. Thismeans that enjoyable (not boring) activities that generate more rapid heart rate, 321 GETTING SPECIFIC: ACTIONS TO REVERSE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE RISK FORCES51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 321deeper breathing, and muscle movement should be identified. Then, groups, times, and places for exercise should be organized. This may be accomplishedwithout full-time staff and without new facilities, as evidenced by the millionsof adults who gather in parks and public places in China's cities to practice Qi-gong each morning that weather permits. Other groups may pursue calisthen-ics, walking, or vigorous folk dancing. Exercise activities are more likely to becontinued regularly if they convey a built-in sense of reward. Shared participa-tion with others is one way to provide this. 322 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHA FREQUENTLY PRESCRIBED EXERCISE PROGRAM Participate in physical activities that involve all major muscle groups. Exert enough effort to increase the heart rate and the frequency and depth of breath- ing. Keep the workout at such a level that you are left with enough breath to speakeasily. You should not experience pain, pressure, or heaviness in the chest during theworkout. Make sessions last at least 30 minutes, and do them at least three days each week. The Institute of Medicine in the U.S.A. in 2002 increased its recommendation to one hourper day, five days per week. If this level of exercise represents a major change from aperson's usual intensity or kind of exertion, he or she should first check with a healthprofessional to make sure the workout is safe. LACK OF ESSENTIAL PRIMARY HEALTH SERVICES The eight overarching risk forces discussed above\u2014each of which causes multi- ple forms of disease, disability, and death\u2014can be fought at the local and indi-vidual levels. But the last two\u2014lack of essential primary health services andchronic endemic poverty\u2014exert their destructive roles on a much larger stagethat requires a national response. The International Conference on Primary Health Care, cosponsored by WHO and UNICEF in 1978 in Alma Ata, USSR, defined essential primary health careto include eight components: 1.Health education on major health problems; 2.Control of local endemic disease; 3.Maternal and child health services, including family planning; 4.Immunizations nutrition services; and 8.T reatment of common ailments, including the use of essential drugs. Most of these have been dealt with in this Handbook as part of the chapters on specific age groups and the sections on diseases. But they have been discussedpiecemeal, and primary health care as a whole is greater than the sum of theseeight parts. It deserves fuller treatment. The establishment and maintenance of primary health care (PHC) services en- tails the commitment of a nation, state, or province to the health of its popu-lation. Staff at PHC centers become health sentinels and advocates scatteredthroughout the geographic and social environment. The sentinel function in-volves reporting community needs and health problems upward through thepolitical structure. The advocate function calls for putting people's health highon the priority lists of central decision-makers and citizens. All eight primary health care components are vital, but two deserve added dis- cussion\u2014immunizations against infectious diseases and maternal and childhealth services. IMMUNIZATIONS AGAINST INFECTIOUS DISEASES Worldwide, immunization programs have been among the most exciting successstories in public health. The greatly increased survival rates of children can beattributed in large part to the gradual conquest of childhood cluster diseases such as pertussis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria,measles, and tetanus. Recently, however, im-munization efforts have become routine inmany places, losing some of their past prior-ity. As a result, there are many populationpockets where immunization coverage hasbecome frighteningly low. It is glamorous tofight an epidemic, but far wiser to prevent it,and PHC and child health programs mustmaintain surveillance on immunization coverage. Children in poor families andstreet children are often left out, for example. Remember, the success of an im-munization program can be judged only by the completeness of its coverage. MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH SERVICES Adequate prenatal care not only reduces infant mortality. More important eco-nomically, it reduces the number of mentally and physically impaired infants 323 GETTING SPECIFIC: ACTIONS TO REVERSE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE RISK FORCESThe success of an immunization program can be judged only by thecompleteness of its coverage. Childrenin poor families and street children,however, often are left out ofimmunization programs.51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 323and children. The GBD Study estimated nearly 33 million healthy years of life lost (DALYs) in infants were due to conditions arising in the perinatal period.Maternal problems during pregnancy and delivery accounted for another 30million disabled life years among women. These losses are most concentrated in developing nations, and many causes lie behind such heavy losses. It would seem most appropriate to begin by provid-ing PHC to women and children and allow that experience to identify the moreprevalent biomedical causes. Second-stage programs can be designed accord-ingly. Childhood diarrheas are a major cause of death in children 1-4 years old.The same PHC outreach can teach mothers oral rehydration therapy and otherbasic skills for identifying and dealing with children's health problems beforethey become serious. The focus of PHC should be kept on primary and secondary prevention of common health problems. It should not be allowed to drift into intensiveand/or expensive care for terminal or infrequent diseases. Many of the mostcost-effective of all health programs take place in PHC work (Bobadilla et al.,1994). POVERTY No matter the level of organization one considers\u2014continent, nation, province,community, or family\u2014wherever there is a rank ordering from rich to middleclass to poor, one also will find a parallel ordering from good to fair to poorhealth. While socioeconomic gradients predict almost every index of health, theymanage to explain very few of them. In a nutshell, poverty is a basic force of riskfor perhaps 90% of the most common diseases and disabilities in the world. Much research has been done to see what must be changed to improve the lives of the poor, with solutions ranging from supplementing incomes, providingfood, providing free or insured access to health care, and providing health in-formation. All these measures have led to some health improvements in popu-lations thus served. Rich and poor alike tend to improve in areas with compre-hensive programs, but counter to expectations, the gaps between rich and poorin disease, disability, and premature death are not shrinking. In fact, they arewidening in many places. Obviously, the ideal solution would be to eliminate poverty. But this is a tall order. Many nations have waged a \"War on Poverty\" over the centuries. Battleshave been won, but not the war. Most people equate poverty with a lack ofmoney or goods, but that is the least toxic of its poisons. The circle of povertyincludes poor health, low education, unskilled and insecure jobs, substandardhousing, unsafe and disorganized neighborhoods, and social stigma and preju- 324 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 324dice. And these lead to a sense of lacking a worthwhile future, lacking hope, and lacking power. Such feelings can become self-fulfilling prophecies. Poverty is an \"agent\" for many diseases and can permeate every level of the en- vironment. It invades the \"host\" by changing the assumptions, attitudes, expec-tations, behaviors, and lifestyles of commu-nities, families, and individuals. It affectsthe community's wealthier strata with apa-thy\u2014the morphine of social structure\u2014generating a numbness to the pain of oth-ers. When any thought is given to thesickness and disability of the poor, rational-izations come quickly. \"The poor shouldhelp themselves.\" \"The plight of the poor is the responsibility of some governmentagency or a private sector organization.\" \"Pov-erty has always existed.\" Poverty requires more than money to cure. Community development work can help reverse this spiral. (Also see the section \"Mobilizing the Community\" in Chapter 12.) Other keys include education, available jobs, adequate hous- ing, community safety, health-building, and overcoming helplessness and hope-lessness. Upward social mobility has been occurring in industrialized countriesthroughout the 20th century. It tends to occur selectively, however, leaving be-hind the people with the worst health status. In the absence of an ideal solution for eliminating poverty, health planners and epidemiologists may do well to find out which environmental and behavioralelements of poverty are vectors of disease and disability and under which cir-cumstances of poverty health is harmed. Indeed, many of these mechanismshave already been discussed earlier in this Handbook. Simple low-technologybehavioral changes that advance biologic and behavioral health are a basicwedge to break the cycle of poverty. IS INCOME INEQUALITY AN INDEPENDENT RISK FACTOR? Social epidemiology research has established that substantial income inequalitywithin a state or nation also is a strong predictor of overall morbidity and mor-tality. Income inequality can be measured by several indexes. The \"Robin HoodIndex\" arranges households by deciles of income and sums the excess over 10%of income that all \"richer\" deciles receive. Higher indexes reflect more severepoverty at lower deciles of the population. Another index uses the aggregate in-come received by the 50% of households with lowest income for each state orunit of study. (These population indexes are relatively easy to estimate, even if 325 GETTING SPECIFIC: ACTIONS TO REVERSE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE RISK FORCESMost people equate poverty with a lack of money or goods, but that is theleast toxic of its poisons. The circle ofpoverty includes poor health, loweducation, unskilled and insecure jobs,substandard housing, unsafe anddisorganized neighborhoods, andsocial stigma and prejudice.51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 325only part of the population is enumerated. Details for calculation are presented in the sources cited for this section.) Several studies report that income inequality is more strongly related to total population death rates than is the absolute level of poverty in the area. Most suchstudies are based on data from industrialized nations, but the same principleshave now been found to apply elsewhere. Income inequality remains a potentpredictor of total population mortality, even after adjusted for the percentage ofhouseholds below a specific poverty level. In the U.S.A., a mere 1% increase inthe inequality index was associated with an increase in mortality of 21.7 deathsper 100,000 in the general population. A similar but smaller gradient was re-ported in England. The effect on those persons actually living in poverty wasmuch greater (Wilkinson, 1996). In studies conducted in the United States, the correlation of income inequality with mortality was quite similar for African-Americans (r=0.39) and for other,mostly white, citizens (r=0.46). When controlled for level of poverty, the lethalpower of income disparity was increased more in African-Americans than in oth-ers, however. Another analysis of the same data set by a different team using awider array of indicators showed a correlation between income inequality andmortality of r=0.62. This broader study also revealed that income disparity corre-lated with all of the indicators of health and social pathology shown in Table 13.2. This set of sociomedical correlates sketches an array of environments within in- dustrialized countries, and they hold true anywhere there is a great economic di- 326 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHTABLE 13.2. C o r r elation of income disparity with health and social pathology indicators.

One environment would be where the population is more homogeneous in incomeand where more babies are born healthy, more people live longer, there is lessviolent crime, fewer murders, fewer people in prison, fewer families receiving fi-nancial assistance, more people having health insurance, more youth continuinginto secondary education, and more children with age-appropriate reading andmathematical skills by the ages of 8 and 9 years. An apt definition of a healthycommunity, indeed! On the other hand, there are social environments that have similar average lev- els of financial assets, but a much greater variability around those averages. Theyhave great financial disparities across families, leading many to have great de-spair. While the cost of shortened life expectancy may be paid only by somepeople, the costs of medical care, police protection, and early school dropoutrates are paid by everyone. Proportionally more money is spent for prisons andless for schools by these governments. The milieu of social pathologies displayedin the prior table automatically accompanies these social environments (Kaplanet al., 1996). Although mortality data are more available and less debatable than illness data, the same processes work to generate excesses of acute and chronic non-fatal dis-ease and disability. International studies of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)show a strong gradient, with poorer nations having more disease and disabilityper 1,000 population. Some of the associations described suggest possible path-ways of pathogenesis. Inequality (according to studies conducted in the U.S.A.)has its greatest impact on the following diagnostic categories: homicide, totalmortality, infant mortality, ischemic heart disease, tuberculosis, infectious dis-eases (in total), hypertensive diseases, and some cancers. And all these are pre-ventable and/or curable diseases. In these environments, apparently, the higherper capita expenditures on medical care are not being spent as appropriately as they could be\u2014that is, on prevention. In other climates and cultures otherpathologies may head the list. Further hints as to possible directions for \"upstream intervention\" have come from linking the concept of \"social capital\" to income disparity research. Socialcapital is a property of a community, state, or province (an ecologic variable)that reflects the level of cooperation, cohesion, shared values, behavioral norms,civic participation, concern for mutual benefit, and trust in the community andin outsiders. In a given community, social capital is created, or diminished, as aby-product of social relationships. Everyone in the community shares in thelevel of social capital. It permeates through the psychosocial, ideological, andeven the physical environment. The hypothesis is that when these levels break down or remain low, people be- come frustrated, resentful, fearful, more isolated, and take on a siege mental- 327 GETTING SPECIFIC: ACTIONS TO REVERSE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE RISK FORCES51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 327ity\u2014they, their family, and their friends come first, everyone else comes last. This mindset manifests itself more acutely at the highest and lowest extremes ofthe socioeconomic ladder. Kawachi and colleagues (1997) have linked income inequality with mortality, and both of these to social capital. 1This team estimated social capital in states in the United States through four indicators: three involved social survey ques-tions about other people's lack of fairness, lack of trustworthiness, and lack ofhelpfulness; the fourth was the average number of memberships in groups andorganizations in the respondent population, as a way to reflect the amount ofcommunity engagement. The proportion of people who responded to the threequestions stating that other people were unfair, unhelpful, and untrustworthyall correlated very highly with a given state's age-adjusted mortality (r from 0.71to 0.79). This was greater than the correlations of income inequality and per-centage of households below the United States poverty threshold to mortality (r -0.65 and r -0.57, respectively). And when a path model was calculated, itwas shown that most of the effect of income inequality on mortality was ex-plained by low social capital. This implies that relative poverty\u2014the display ofwealth as viewed by the \"have nots\"\u2014breaks down morale, erodes the sense thatthe community is treating people fairly, and dissolves the belief that by hardwork one can achieve material success. It sets barriers between groups. IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIAL POLICY If governments work to increase social participation, fairness, and helpfulness,and help people to increase their trust in others and in the government, will theysucceed? If they do, will it improve health? Is reducing income extremes the eas-iest way to advance health? Or is the solution to reduce social problems associ-ated with striking inequality? These are all unanswered questions. Correlationsdon't necessarily mean causation. It should be kept in mind that some social ex-periments have minimal downside risks and just might pay off in more waysthan appears on face value. Governments could certainly respond as follows: Increase the proportion of school-age children who attend school regularly. Increase the effectiveness of teaching and learning throughout the school sys- tem, especially in the first six grades (ages 6-12 years). 328 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH1Again, data from United States states were used. Unfortunately, this is not a replication of find- ings, but it does expand the range of inferences.51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 328Increase, on a yearly basis, the number of school years that the majority of children and youth complete, until 90% have advanced literacy, social com-petence, and job skills adequate for the new century. Redistribute health care budgets better to serve the basic needs of the wholepopulation (see Bobadilla, 1994). Encourage community members to join associations, civic and religiousgroups, parent-teacher organizations at schools, and informal mutual supportgroups. This is especially important in low-income areas as part of commu-nity development. Moreover, it has a direct effect on health program partici-pation. (Also see sections \"Mobilizing the Community\" and \"Spread- ing New Health Behaviors through the Community\" in Chapter 12.) Besides, most higher income people already belong to multiple organizations and groups. Encourage fairness in housing by subsidizing new housing for low-incomefamilies, setting health and safety standards for rental housing, and imposingrent ceilings on below-standard units until they are improved. Use taxation systems that tend to reduce inequalities, such as progressive rateincome taxes, where wealthier persons pay a higher percentage on their earn-ings than persons at or below the median. Sales taxes on purchases of dailyneeds should be kept low. They cost low-income people a higher percentageof their earnings than they cost the wealthy. Luxury taxes (such as on jewelry,luxury cars, or imported non-essentials) also serve as a good source of stateincome. If property taxes provide a \"homestead allowance\" to shelter lower-price homes and a surtax on high-priced luxury properties, further levelingwill be achieved. Levy \"sin taxes\" on alcohol and tobacco. Revenues can help support healthprograms. Provide universal easy access to primary health care and to cost-effectivescreening and preventive interventions to help break the spiral of poor healthand social deprivation. And what about income redistribution to achieve greater equality? Is it politi- cally possible? Is it necessary? Several of the studies on income disparity andpoor health come from the United States, which has a more extreme incomedisparity than most nations. Nevertheless, the principal findings are supportedin multination studies. Actually, graphs showing the relation of income disparity to excess mortality (among states in the United States) suggest that only limited reductions in the ex- 329 GETTING SPECIFIC: ACTIONS TO REVERSE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE RISK FORCES51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 3:22 PM Page 329tremity of inequality provide considerable health benefit. All seven of the states with highest age-adjusted mortality had income inequalities suchthat the poorest 50% of the population receivedless than 21% of the total household income forthe population. Under perfect equality, 50% of thehouseholds would receive 50% of the income. In-ferences from this single U.S. study are admittedlyshaky, and may not apply elsewhere, but tem-porarily we might proffer the hypothesis that rais-ing the income share of the least well-off half of the population to at least 25% of the population total, would show positive social, psychological, and biological health effects in thewhole population, as part of a \"preventive package\" of services. More practically stated, wherever traveling about through cities and countryside shows pockets of unusually deep poverty, health officials can be sure that highsickness and death rates dwell there also. There is an uncanny geographic clus-tering of biological, psychological, social, and economic pathologies in the sameneighborhoods. The areas with the highest infant mortality and highest cardio-vascular death rates before age 65 years, usually also have high rates of destruc-tive fires, homicide, social service needs, children not attending school, and sub-standard housing (Jenkins et al., 1977). No fancy studies are needed. The onlynecessary step is to scan the most recent scientific literature for new proven waysto reduce the health inequities\u2014and to launch the interventions. 330 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHWherever there are pockets of unusually deep poverty in cities or countryside, health officials can be sure that high sickness and death rates dwell there also. There is an uncanny geographic clustering of biological, psychological, social, and economic pathologies in the same neighborhoods.51331_p307_350_r1 4/7/03 PM Page 33114. Is Good Health Achievable and Sustainable? CONFRONTING BASIC DECISIONS Every day we live, we come to a crossroad\u2014the crossroad between past and fu- ture. The present is only a crowded intersection. Shall we continue onward inour habitual ways of thinking, expecting, and doing? Or, shall we risk makinga change? Families, communities, professional groups, and organizations en-counter crossroads every day, too. They, like us, are usually too busy keeping ondoing what they have always done, and do not look around to see the manypossibilities for more rewarding futures. CAN THE WORLD, MY COMMUNITY, OR MY FAMILY ACHIEVE BETTER HEALTH? This Handbook presents many possibilities. In general, these are steps that can advance health without expensive equipment or supplies. Moreover, these stepscan be taken by people at all levels of education, at all ages, and in most socialcircumstances. Our answer, then, is: \"Yes, the world can achieve better health\u2014provided that enough people see the vision.\" It will happen when enough individuals andgroups keep performing the simple tasks required. SHOULD WE WAIT FOR NEW DISCOVERIES IN MEDICAL SCIENCES? NEW \"MAGIC BULLET\" VACCINES? No. Today we can take many giant steps toward reducing disease, disability, and death based on past discoveries and existing breakthroughs in the health sci-ences. We already know how to prevent many diseases and injuries and how todrastically reduce the incidence of most others. These preventive technologiesalready have been proven successful, albeit mostly in economically developedcountries. Now, they must be applied on a much broader scale, and adapted todifferent cultures and geographies. 333 IS GOOD HEALTH ACHIEVABLE AND SUSTAINABLE?51331_p351_374_r1 4/7/03 2:41 PM Page 333The history of smallpox control is instructive. Edward Jenner developed the first successful smallpox vaccine in 1796. Improved vaccines were developed in the19th century, but international epidemics continued. Finally, after hundreds ofmillions of vaccinations were administered in the 20th century, the vision of pos-sibly eradicating smallpox broke into world thinking. Eradication was achievedin 1977. Remember, however, that smallpox eradication happened only after: Enough people believed eradication was possible\u2014they had the \"vision.\" Agencies organized surveillance and immunization outreach programs. Agencies obtained the required human and financial resources for theseprograms. Agencies diligently executed the programs, readjusting plans and operationsto fit \"hard to reach\" subpopulations, until the job was completed. We contend that these same four steps are required to conquer other diseases. Poliomyelitis already has been eradicated from the Western Hemisphere. Mosthealth problems, however, are not susceptible to eradication. This limitationholds for infectious diseases whose agents have multiple reservoirs and can sur-vive outside living hosts for long periods. It also applies to chronic degenerativediseases and those caused by common toxins, malnutrition, behavioral andmental disorders, and \"external causes.\" The time-window of inertia lasted nearly 180 years for smallpox (1796-1977), but it can be as short as a decade for some of the major health problems dis-cussed in this Handbook. The health establishment and community leadershipshould recognize that the required technology is available\u2014although not yetwidely enough known. The same steps listed above are the key to progress now.They can be restated for non-eradicable health problems, as follows: Enough people must believe change and progress are possible\u2014and valuable! Enough local programs must be conducted and evaluated to learn how to in-tervene effectively. (This may be as simple as the \"Back to Sleep\" program inthe section \"From Birth to 4 Years Old\" in Chapter 3.) Sufficient human and monetary resources are harnessed to do the job on alarger scale. Programs are executed diligently, controlling resources, evaluating progress,and readjusting design and operations to fit the subcultures encountered. (Also see the section \"Spreading New Health Behaviors through the Community\" in Chapter 12.) 334 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p351_374_r1 4/7/03 2:41 PM Page 334Now we must move ahead with the tools that are available. Waiting for new breakthroughs in the biomedical sciences or miracle vaccines will only paralyzeprogress. The people and nations most in need of such \"magic bullets\" haverarely been able to afford them, because such high-technology advances costmany millions of dollars to develop. Commercial science laboratories usuallyfocus on those problems whose solution promises high monetary rewards. ( The Economist, 14 August 1999) cites \"Doctors without Borders\" (\"M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res\") reporting having counted 1,223 new pharmaceutical compoundsplaced on the medical market between 1975 and 1997. Only 11 of these werefor tropical diseases. The communities and patients suffering from such diseasesgenerally cannot raise enough money to pay for the production of drugs formass epidemics, nor for the high costs invested in all the unsuccessful com-pounds that were tested en route to finding the best ones. The trickle-down ofexpensive high technology is exceedingly slow. And when it arrives, it may notbe locally relevant. WHAT ARE THE HEALTH GOALS IMPLIED IN THIS HANDBOOK? WHAT MIGHT BE THE HANDBOOK'S MISSION STATEMENT? Is it to mount as many of the suggested intervention programs that a state or community can? Is it to prevent as many deaths as possible? No, the goals here are much more modest. The Handbook's basic mission is to inform and stimulate persons who value health and value others, and the orga-nizations with which they are involved, to engage in the following: to prevent disease, disability, and premature death as early as possible; to do this as inexpensively and effectively as possible; to apply techniques and methods that are already proven and sustainable; and to select conditions to prevent (and subpopulations to reach) so as to pro-vide the greatest benefit for the greatest proportion of the population as awhole. As it happens, as we cross into the 21st century, reaching for these health goals will involve generating behavioral and social changes, most of all. DECIDING BETWEEN PREVENTION AND ADVANCED TREATMENT In an ideal world, every nation would be able to find sufficient resources to carry out primary, secondary, and tertiary medical care, as well as all levels of preven- 335 IS GOOD HEALTH ACHIEVABLE AND SUSTAINABLE?51331_p351_374_r1 4/7/03 2:41 PM Page 335tion. In the real world, however, most nations have\u2014and others claim to have\u2014a severe shortage of resources for health services. In many Central Amer-ican and South American nations, expenditures for health care (in inflation-adjusted currency units) actually declined during the economic depression be-tween 1980 and 1990. This may well have happened elsewhere in the world,but data were not available to us from other Regions. When resources are scarce, difficult decisions must be made. Clinical medicine puts the individual patient's welfare first. But what if that perspective hurts thecommunity as a whole? Community medicine and public health put the healthand functioning of the community first. This might include economic consid-erations, such as giving priority to health protection and promotion for work-ers and parents of younger children. A healthy workforce can generate the rev-enues to fund expansion of health care to the entire age range. Parents who arementally and physically healthy can provide careful (i.e., full of care) common-sense parenting to reduce the frequency and severity of childhood illnesses andinjuries, and the costs of their medical care. In contrast, hospital care of advanced (especially, incurable or terminal) cases spends too much money on too few people, and gives little economic benefit tothe community and nation. Of course, it seems to be the only humane thing to do. But, it must be recognized that the resources spent on one advanced case may mean the loss of primary preventive efforts, which might have keptdozens of healthy people from losing their health and becoming economicallydependent. Phillips and colleagues estimate that in more affluent countries itcosts US $50,000 on average to treat advanced cancer per healthy year of lifesaved. In contrast, providing pain relief for advanced cancer patients costs be-tween US $100 and US $300 per year. Preventive care contrasts are even greater,with antibiotic treatment of tuberculosis costing US $5 to US $7 per year ofhealthy life saved (DALY). The Expanded Program on Immunization costs onlyUS $12 to US $30, and treatment of sexually transmitted infections costs US $10 to US $25 per DALY saved. That is a minimum of 2,000 times morecost-effective than intensive cancer treatment, and 480 times more cost-effectivethan modern anti-viral treatments for AIDS at current prices (Phillips et al.,1992; Murray and Lopez, 1994). Which, then, is the more humane investment of limited health funding? HOW CAN WE DO BOTH: PREVENT AND TREAT? In theory, if prevention works there will be fewer cases of disease to treat, and medical costs would hopefully decline. But, preventive efforts must reach out tothousands of people because, in most situations, health science cannot predictwhich few will encounter the \"pathogen,\" be it the measles virus or an automo-bile that is out of control. 336 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p351_374_r1 4/7/03 2:41 PM Page 336Suppose it costs $1 apiece to reach 1,000 people with a totally effective preven- tive program. Suppose the disease prevented ordinarily afflicts only 1% of thepopulation (10 people), and each case costs $100 to treat successfully. Onecould argue that such preventive efforts cost as much as they gain\u2014that they areof neutral value. Such a calculation leaves out the non-cash costs of pain and lostfunction, as well as the monetary costs of lost work. This can add up to severaldays or more per worker, resulting in lost productivity to the employers, andperhaps lost wages to the worker. So, even \"cash-flow neutral\" interventions arelikely to be biopsychosocially valuable, once the larger equation is considered. However, quite many preventive interventions have been demonstrated to cre- ate more cash benefits than they cost. Evaluations of many health promotionprograms in the workplace show that they typically reduce the amount of illnessabsences, and both outpatient clinic and hospital costs. A summary of 28 sepa-rate studies showed that workplace health promotion usually saves the employ-ers at least three times the money that the program costs. Typically, there is a lagof two to three years between the change in health habits and the reduction inonset of major diseases (reviewed in Fries et al., 1993). Smoking cessation programs extend life, thus providing more years to accumu- late medical costs. Nevertheless, the lifetime medical costs for continuing smok-ers accumulate so much faster in fewer years, that smoking cessation is cost-effective for the community, as well as for the individual. Therefore, invest inproven smoking prevention efforts. REDUCING COSTS OF EACH UNIT OF SERVICE RENDERED Another way health care programs can reduce costs is by having diagnosis andtreatment performed by fully qualified, rather than overqualified, professionals.It does not require a specialty-certified physician to deal with a common respi-ratory infection or uncomplicated diarrhea, or to do routine monitoring ofhypertension or depression. Physicians' assistants, nurses, and other properlytrained health workers can provide such care equally effectively. Of course, brain surgery should be performed only by brain surgeons, often with diagnostic assistance from a certified neurologist. But not everyone withheadaches needs to be treated by one of these specialists. There are validatedflow diagrams that enable subdoctoral health professionals to screen 1,000headache patients to identify the 50 to 100 who need further triage by a physi-cian, who then checks thoroughly for possible need for neurological care. Flow charts and decision-making algorithms have been developed for many symptom patterns, including sexually transmitted infections. (See the section on \"Unsafe Sex\" in Chapter 13). If they were more widely used, both in in- 337 IS GOOD HEALTH ACHIEVABLE AND SUSTAINABLE?51331_p351_374_r1 4/7/03 2:41 PM Page 337dustrialized and in developing nations, health professionals could be employed more efficiently, costs would be cut sharply, and more truly sick people could beprocessed and helped by the health system. INCREASING SELF-CARE AND REDUCING DEMAND ON FACILITIES AND PROFESSIONALS The ultimate step in delegating medical decisions and care to less costly care- givers is to promote care within families and self-care. The general public shouldknow more and do more to promote their own health. Consumer-orientedgroups in post-industrialized nations have come forth with sayings such as:\"Your health is too important to be left in the hands of others!\" The objective is to teach and motivate the general public: to know how to reduce risk factors for many conditions; to know how to care for the minor, self-limiting health problems of their fam- ilies and themselves; to recognize, with a margin of safety, when professional evaluation and careis probably required; and to ask their health care givers at regular intervals whether any preventive careis timely\u2014e.g., immunization, screening, or assistance with health habits. The overall goal is to reduce unnecessary or trivial use of health services. Reduc- tions of 7% to 17% have been reported by simple patient education programs(Fries et al., 1993). SETTING COST-EFFECTIVE PRIORITIES In addition to reducing demand for health care, savings (both of healthy func-tion and medical costs) can be achieved by wider use of some true preventivehealth bargains (see Bobadilla et al., 1994). Popular thinking says that a surgeonwho charges US$ 2,000 for a given operation must do twice as good a job asone who charges US$ 1,000, or that the more a health program costs, the bet-ter it must be. In fact, the per capita costs of prevention programs have little re-lation to their economic and social benefits. The ten following interventions are among the most cost-effective in develop- ing and transitional countries per healthy-life-year preserved: 338 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p351_374_r1 4/7/03 2:41 PM Page 3381.expanded programs of immunization for children (the six vaccines, plus hepatitis B vaccine and vitamin A); 2.iodine supplementation (only in iodine-deficient areas); 3.removal of intestinal parasites (by sanitation and drugs); 4.effective antibiotic treatment of tuberculosis and Hanson's disease; 5.prevention and control of HIV care; and 10.school health programs (including providing a nutritious meal where under- nutrition is common). Other preventive programs may also deliver large local health bonuses at low costs, depending on the environment and prevalence of specific conditions, andease of program delivery. The \"bottom line\" is not to spend money on cost-ineffective prevention or treatment programs until more cost-effective interventions have been carriedout. Note that the 10 most effective programs (in most places) are all low intechnology and high in personal contact by caring health workers. Issues of eq-uity also should enter into setting priorities (more comprehensive evaluations ofmore than 40 kinds of interventions are presented in the World Bank publica-tion by Jamison and colleagues (1993). WHAT MIGHT THE FUTURE HOLD? Long-range planning for advancing health must, of course, look to the future.Economists, health statisticians, and specialists in specific diseases have pub-lished many predictions for the first portion of the 21st century. The predictionscome from mathematical models that combine different assumptions about fu-ture population growth, economic development, and national health program-ming. Inasmuch as there are multiple scenarios for each of these domains, thetotal of all likely combinations is overwhelming. Some scenarios assume past 339 IS GOOD HEALTH ACHIEVABLE AND SUSTAINABLE?51331_p351_374_r1 4/7/03 2:41 PM Page 339TABLE 14.1. W orld population growth, by Region, 1990 data and projections to 2020.

Longer predictions have more time for cumulativeerror than do short predictions. POPULATION AND INCOME PROJECTIONS Table 14.1 presents world population growth by Regions, based on 1990 dataand projected to the year 2020. For the first 20 years of the 21st century, popu-lation is expected to grow overall by 27.3%. Of particular concern are the ex-pected growth rates in Sub-Saharan Africa of almost 70% and in the MiddleEastern Crescent of 53%; the latter also includes the southern and eastern for-mer Soviet republics, which are primarily of Islamic culture. Such explosive pop-ulation growth will overwhelm the capacity of the Regional economic systems tofeed and house such masses, and the health system to care for the sick. Even the27% increases in Latin America and the Caribbean and in Southeast Asia andIslands are beyond what the nations in those Regions can adequately care for,given their present health circumstances and health service infrastructure. Although such rapid growth raises fears about future health worldwide, it is those Regions themselves that will experience greater starvation and more dis-eases of poverty, disabilities, and premature deaths. The rapid increase in the 340 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHPopulation (in millions)51331_p351_374_r1 4/7/03 2:41 PM Page 340proportion of the child population that is dependent on others, combined with constricted economic resources, which are not expected to grow by much (seethe GDP data in Table 14.1), might well open these Regions to even greaterdeprivation and civil unrest. Programs to provide family planning are not designed to reduce the size of eth- nic or geographic groups, but rather to enable families and populations to growat modest enough levels so that children can be adequately fed, kept healthy,and educated sufficiently to prepare them for full lives. These are the goals ofnational family planning programs that should be emphasized. More impor-tantly, they are goals that almost all families share. But, where future thinkingextends only to the next day's food, the next harvest, and to \"who will help us,\"dreams or fears about the next decade\u2014even for one's family and for oneself\u2014are not allowed to intrude upon dealing with daily crisis. The huge differences in per capita income between wealthy and poor nations will actually widen between 2000 and 2020. Established market economies willcapture 45% of the total world product in both these years, but by 2020 theestablished market economies will comprise only 11.5% of the world popula-tion vs. 13.6% in 2000. An additional demographic force that will change the face of world health in the next 20 years is the aging of the population expected in all countries. The popu-lation will have proportionally more people over age 50, and hence an increase inchronic disease prevalence and in proportional mortality due to diseases of olderadults. Economically, the cost to care for frail, dependent elders will multiply. HEALTH PROJECTIONS Table 14.2 presents comparisons of the relative importance of selected causes ofyears of healthy life lost (DALYs) between estimates for 1990 (based on partialdata) and projections for 2010 (based on extrapolation of trends and anticipatedmedical progress). We have chosen 2010 rather than more distant projectionsbecause the margin of error should be smaller. Projections for changes in world DALYs from 1990 to 2010 point to improved health for women (10% fewer DALYs) and worse health for men (5% moreDALYs). This happens despite similar population increases for both genders.(We present total DALYs rather than DALYs per million population, becausethe former better represents the overall need for health services.) The burden of all infectious and parasitic diseases is expected to decline about 27%, with HIV/AIDS being the only exception\u2014its burden quadruples. Dis- 341 IS GOOD HEALTH ACHIEVABLE AND SUSTAINABLE?51331_p351_374_r1 4/7/03 2:41 PM Page 341abling and fatal respiratory infections in children are expected to drop by nearly half, as are nutritional deficiencies and the pathologies of the perinatal period. Ingeneral, the greatest improvements are projected for the aggregate of \"Commu-nicable, Maternal, Perinatal, and Nutritional Conditions,\" referred to as Cate-gory 1 in World Health Statistics . This apparently assumes a spread of preventive health programs from wealthier nations in temperate climates to economicallydeprived nations in tropical regions. Despite these expected sharp declines, thiscategory will remain the single greatest health burden for the foreseeable future. Increases\u2014often large\u2014in the burden of chronic and degenerative diseases also are anticipated. The projected total burden (not population prevalence) for ma-lignant neoplasms is expected to increase 71% for men and 42% for women bythe year 2010. For all cardiovascular disorders, the corresponding increases are49% and 13%, respectively; increases for chronic respiratory disorders are 39%for men and 32% for women. The already substantial margin by which men dieyounger than women will increase sharply in the next decade. Neuropsychiatric disability will continue to rise in both men (26%) and women (30%). All the major conditions are expected to increase in number. Cases ofmajor depression may increase by 38%, causing the overall loss of more than 70million healthy life years in 2010. Women are more affected than men, bearing65% of this burden. Injuries are expected to increase overall, again with men more stricken than women. The most alarming increase will occur for road traffic disability anddeath, rising by 65% for men and 79% for women in just the 20 years between1990 and 2010! 342 BUILDING BETTER HEALTHTABLE 14.2.

Diarrheal diseases, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, andvaccine-preventable diseases of childhood will be the top four subcategories for both sexes. The reversed sequences of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th sources of dis-ablement for men and women are of interest, and warrant special attentionwhen planning preventive outreach (see Table 14.2). The overall priority issues for 2010 are similar to those in 1990. Respiratory in- fections in children will become less serious, but chronic obstructive pulmonarydiseases of adults will increase sharply. The large projected increases in malignancies have their roots in the past. Many cancers do not appear clinically until 20 to 30 years after carcinogenic exposureshave begun. Similarly, stopping exposures to cancerous chemicals this year andsubsequently will start showing benefits only after a similar delay. The samekinds of malignancies that caused most death and disability in 1990 will do soin 2010, but in greater volume. The expected increases (both genders com-bined) are as follows: Stomach cancer up 66% Liver cancer up 80%T rachea, bronchus, lung up 109%Women's breast cancer up 31% The doubling of lung cancer burden in just 20 years is part of the worldwide pandemic of tobacco-related diseases. Its roots are already planted so deeply asto be fatal for about one-third of heavy users of tobacco who are now alive.There is no need for this pandemic to continue. It will stop, but only when thecommunity of nations and peoples has the will to make it happen. On the other hand, consider the positive predictions of drastic reductions in dis- ease burden from infectious, parasitic, and perinatal conditions. The 2010 out-comes may fall short of the goals unless more effective outreach is made to themany high mortality areas. Again, the key is collective will\u2014the will of the pop-ulations affected, the will of their leaders, and the will of those organizations(read: decision-makers) who control the resources needed to make it happen. The future is not foreordained. It is malleable and it is in our hands. PROTECTIVE FORCES TO ADVANCE HEALTH Chapter 13 reviewed ten of the major forces that diminish life to the end-points of disability and death. It also suggested ways to combat those damaging forces. 343 IS GOOD HEALTH ACHIEVABLE AND SUSTAINABLE?51331_p351_374_r1 4/7/03 2:41 PM Page 343Built into the core of the human species is a life force to survive, to function, to be fruitful, and to raise descendants who will do the same. For uncounted mil-lennia, the life force has prevailed over the \"bad stuff,\" even though more andmore of the latter is of human making. I will now discuss a number of provenprotective forces that can be used to augment humans' inborn drive to surviveand, even, to realize a newer desire to thrive. Many simple, protective, and health-promoting steps are ready to be taken. They are assembled in outline form here, since most have been explained morecompletely earlier in this Handbook. The steps will be sorted by whether theprimary responsibility for them is likely to rest with the community (or state),the family or primary group, or the individual. COMMUNITY AND STATE RESPONSIBILITIES 1.Work to have an adequate food supply \u2014enough to prevent both general and specific malnutrition. Ensure that essential foods get to all young children. 2.Provide a safe drinking water supply. One clean well protected from drain- age is a good start. Build onward from there. 3.Provide and maintain a safe waste and sewage disposal system. 4.Maintain purity standards for foods sold commercially. 5.Teach and facilitate personal and domestic hygiene. 6.Provide basic primary health care available for all, including prenatal and infant care, family planning, immunizations, school health, sexual diseaseprevention and treatment, tuberculosis treatment. and health promotion.Prenatal and infant clinics can teach good parenting. 7.Encourage disease prevention through community policies and teaching to prevent: tobacco use, alcohol and drug abuse, unsafe sex, carelessness withvehicles, and risk-taking. Cooperate with schools and other channels ofinfluence. (Also see the section on \"Motor Vehicle Injuries\" in Chap- ter 11.) 8.Encourage health promotion, through community policies and teaching, to improve parenting and to promote anger management skills from child-hood onward. 344 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p351_374_r1 4/7/03 2:41 PM Page 3449.Teach and enforce traffic laws for motor vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians. 10.Prevent and control community health hazards, which might otherwise be generated by factories, large farms, mines, etc. 11.Restrict the flow of lethal weapons, especially those that can quickly kill multiple persons. 12.Encourage local organizations to build social cohesion, to create founda- tions for fair behavior and social trust, thereby to repair faults and schismsin the social structure. This will advance everyone's health. (Also see the section on \"Poverty\" in Chapter 13.) 13.Encourage and facilitate groups, families, and individuals to respond health- fully to concerns at their levels. Communities stand poised in the middle of a \"high-wire balancing act.\" There is a delicate balance involved in properly allocating responsibilities to nationsand provinces, to communities, or to organizations, families, or individuals.The political system has much to do with whether responsibilities tend to getpushed upward or downward. A general rule is that each level prefers having thebenefits rather than the responsibilities. One strategy is to keep both at the samelevel, so that those who carry on the responsibility successfully reap the rewards.This keeps up the good work. When a given level of the social structure doesnot have the resources or the degree of control necessary to fulfill a responsibil-ity, however, that work needs to be reassigned upward to a higher level. GROUP AND FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES Group here refers to neighborhoods, extended families, coworkers, students in a classroom, and any other assemblage of people that has ongoing closeinteractions. 1.Set standards for personal interaction that are fair, caring, trustworthy, help- ful, and dependable. This could start anywhere, but should certainly includemarital partners and extend to infants, children, families, schools, workplaces,and neighborhoods. This is a prime component of \"social capital,\" whichunderlies the physical, mental, and social health of a community. It creates asocial fabric that encourages persons, families, and communities to flourish. 2.Encourage and facilitate domestic hygiene, at least sufficiently to prevent transmission of disease. Reward personal hygiene for all in the group. 345 IS GOOD HEALTH ACHIEVABLE AND SUSTAINABLE?51331_p351_374_r1 4/7/03 2:41 PM Page 3453.Teach and practice healthy lifestyles\u2014build that into the group or family culture. This includes eating a healthy diet, regularly engaging in exercise,getting adequate sleep, avoiding personal toxins (alcohol, tobacco, illicitdrugs), avoiding unsafe sex, and steering clear of risk taking that could beself-destructive or destructive to others. 4.Teach and facilitate timely use of preventive health services, as well as use of primary medical care when required. 5.Collectively keep the immediate environment free of health hazards, includ- ing those leading to trauma, falls, burns, poisons, insects, parasites, toxins,and infectious exposures. 6.Work collectively to encourage local schools, the community, city, and state to address their health responsibilities effectively. 7.Teach and strengthen coping abilities to reduce distress, fears, depression, and especially to manage anger. Teach problem solving so that no one loses. 8.Build and maintain social support networks that provide information, prac- tical assistance, emotional sharing, and a sense of belonging to everyone inthe group or family, especially those who might otherwise be isolated. Socialsupport is a potent force for physical and mental health. It hastens recoveryfrom illness and extends healthy years of life. 9.Encourage and facilitate individuals to respond healthfully to concerns at their levels both for their personal benefit and for the well being of thegroup. INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITIES 1.Respond positively to the health initiatives of the state and community. 2.Follow the positive health teaching and practice of families and other groups, and urge others to do the same. 3.Practice a healthy lifestyle, as described in public health or preventive med- icine textbooks and in this Handbook. 4.Use one's roles in the family, workplace, and as a citizen to encourage one's family, social groups, community, and state to fully meet their responsibili-ties to advance health. 5.Be informed and take responsibility for one's own well being and health. 346 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p351_374_r1 4/7/03 2:41 PM Page 346STEPS ALONG THE ROAD This Handbook has emphasized using low technology for preventive interven- tions and primary health care. This relates to the \"hardware\" involved. In con-trast, we have called for changes in knowledge, attitudes, expectations, behaviors,and social values. Doesn't achieving these require an even higher technology?Probably so. But the \"high technology\" for behavioral and social change residesin the \"software\"\u2014the way we prepare ourselves, our collaborators, and ourhealth programs to excite people, to enlist them in health goals and activities,and to participate in those opportunities offered to advance health. Health psy-chologists are still working on the software: writing new programs and debug-ging old ones. Different cultures and climates run on different operating sys-tems, so programming may continue for years. Nevertheless, we stress again, wecan begin now, right where we are. (Review \"the toolbox\" of ideas for facil- itating changes shown in Chapter 12.) TAKE ONE STEP AT A TIME Large system-wide changes are dramatic, but they are not always fully success- ful and may not be sustainable. Professor B.F . Skinner, a founder of behaviormodification, could teach pigeons to do remarkable tricks, such as pushing aping-pong ball back and forth to each other. Such skills, however, were learnedone small step at a time, starting by paying attention to the ball, then touchingit, and onward over many days and weeks. Many personal and community changes are best approached in the same way, gradually\u2014one cluster of services at a time or in one demonstration neighbor-hood only, until the program can be \"fine tuned.\" That way, problems can beidentified and corrected by the team when they are small, and at a small cost.For big programs, the critics will covet the money spent and be quick to raisean outcry about every shortcoming, hoping to get the whole effort cancelled. Critics may also sabotage a proposed program (of any kind) by overenthusiasm. Years ago, I was a junior member of a health team trying to convince a corpo-ration to field-test a small preventive medicine program in one of their factories.We met around the table with an occupational physician from the factory andwith corporate officers. After criticism of the idea and efforts to find gaps in theproposal failed, the tide turned. Former critics became staunch supporters. Theynow said they had underestimated the program's value, and really it should beexpanded to reach more workers than originally proposed, and to include mostof the corporations' factories. Our health team agreed, and the corporate con-ferees took the proposal to top management. Top management shot it down im-mediately, pointing out it was too big a program; it lacked field-testing; and nodata on the cost-benefit balance were available. 347 IS GOOD HEALTH ACHIEVABLE AND SUSTAINABLE?51331_p351_374_r1 4/7/03 2:41 PM Page 347Hey! Let's set up a committee! This cry, like bad television, is spreading like a plague from developed to devel- oping countries. Yes, much important work is decided upon and organized bycommittees, but often sharp ideas come to a committee and get filed down todullness\u2014or just get filed. An epidemiologist working in a state in the United States discovered specific poverty areas where age-sex adjusted mortality was 30% higher than in the stateas a whole and 60% higher than that in more affluent areas. These findings werepublished in a prestigious medical journal, and reported dramatically by news-papers and television in a dozen states. Reporters came to the state governor andthe mayor of the largest city asking what they would do to resolve the problem.Certainly time was needed for further review and planning. The governor andmayor both exclaimed, \"Hey! Let's set up a committee.\" Setting up the committee went slowly, as did its work. By the time the official report and plan of action were delivered, three months had passed. The publicand the reporters were chasing new headlines. The pressure was off health issues.Nothing ever was done. Government officials were honestly busy with otherpressing issues. (Perhaps referring them to other committees.) Momentum, tim-ing, and insights into the sources of power are vital. Many a national or provin-cial health official has stumbled over the complexities of local politics and com-peting personalities, or waited until the fickle wave of momentum had passed. Working incrementally has other advantages, too. Since facing changes is threat- ening, smaller changes should cause less anxiety. A helpful approach is to link thenew effort to activities and purposes that are already familiar and accepted, sothat the public will recognize that the new elements will fit in comfortably. Fur-thermore, after new changes become connected to the ongoing flow of commu-nity life, and prove to generate benefits greater than their costs, they will requireless program energy to be maintained. That energy can then be shifted to ad-vance the next innovation. In localities where sanitation and universally availablechild health clinics, for example, become accepted as parts of \"what makes ourcommunity such a good one,\" there will be few barriers to their sustainability. Automobile manufacturers offer new improvements and conveniences as op- tions each new model year. Those that are perceived as making a positive addi-tion to the autos after a few years, soon become an intrinsic part of the \"stan-dard model.\" Community health programs that prove valuable follow the samenatural history. Existing competition between neighborhoods or cities can pro-vide the motivation to get additional public health services started and main-tained. (Also see the section \"Mobilizing the Community\" in Chapter 12.) 348 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p351_374_r1 4/7/03 2:41 PM Page 348ENLISTING NEW KINDS OF HEALTH WORKERS Health needs are so intense in so many places that the available human resources cannot meet the demand. What can be done? Let's consider these possibilities: 1.T rain a new category of community health facilitators. Select candidates care- fully for keen minds and caring hearts. Add perhaps one year of practicaltraining at first, with continuing opportunities for learning and improvingskills each year thereafter. No nation has a shortage of intelligent people.Only the training system, the career path, and the resource \"set aside\" tofund the network are missing. These facilitators would learn the basis of pre-ventive medicine, the rationale and techniques to render the simplest of pri-mary health care, and the psychosocial skills to facilitate behavioral changesthat build health. 2.Once health facilitators are available in a state or province, more intensively trained and credentialed health workers can supervise and sharpen their skillsin tasks that can be safely delegated. In effect, this would multiply the ser-vices delivered, without increasing the number of physicians and nurse prac-titioners. Further it would cut costs considerably per unit of service delivered. 3.Augment the training of health educators by having them participate in clin- ical health behavior change and community development work. Participa-tory learning is powerful. In most places, health educators' skills in providinginformation, packaging messages, and leading groups, exceed their familiar-ity with issues of psychological processes, motivation, and behavior change.That can be remedied. 4.Health facilitators and health educators/promoters together can enlist and prepare a majority of the public to participate more actively in health pro-motion, disease prevention, and basic minor care for themselves and theirfamilies. This has two outcomes: it lowers health care costs and it builds ahealth-conscious constituency. The latter will support health-related initia-tives politically in the community, state, and nation. 5.Different kinds of environmental scientists are needed\u2014ones trained to work with the social and cultural environments. There are shortages of scientistswho work with problems in the physical and biological environments, butthe most acute shortage\u2014and the one to fix first\u2014is the virtual absence inhealth agencies of scientists who work with the social, cultural, and ideolog-ical environments. We need such scientists whose first commitment is tobuilding health. The contributions of health economists, political scientists,and successful practicing politicians should also be enlisted. These profes- 349 IS GOOD HEALTH ACHIEVABLE AND SUSTAINABLE?51331_p351_374_r1 4/7/03 2:41 PM Page 349sionals can help move good ideas into good programs, good programs into effective public actions, and effective actions into rewarding health outcomes. 6.Find ways to develop more \"salutogenic people.\" The late Professor Aaron Antonovsky popularized the term \"salutogenesis,\" derived from the Latin\"salus\" (health) and the Greek \"genesis\" (originating or giving birth). Simplyput, the word means \"giving birth to health.\" In reviewing the pages of thisHandbook, we will recall many conditions in life that are salutogenic: goodnutrition, a safe environment, loving parenting, social encouragement andsupport. Are there ways to add a great throng of ordinary citizens to the ranks of \"salu- togenic people\"? Yes, the world has hundreds of thousands of doctors and perhaps millions of nurses, hospital personnel, and allied health workers. At a less institutionalizedlevel, there are the \"barefoot doctors of China,\" the community health aids inYemen, and traditional birth-attendants almost everywhere. The world's currenthealth status\u2014better than ever in all of history\u2014attests to the dedication, skills,and labor of all of them. Yet, the journey toward world health has a long distance to go, and more helpers are needed than the nations can afford to train and to hire. Could mass train-ing of people to promote health and prevent disease for themselves and theirfamilies be the most powerful and cost-effective step the world health commu-nity can now take? Could these community participants in personal and family health extend their outreach, perhaps only in times of special need or when requested, to theirneighbors? To a local school? To a community group? With the guidance ofprofessionals, self-help groups might be started. In communities where manypersons have diabetes, groups of such persons could inform and support eachother in all the aspects of managing this disease, with occasional guidance froma physician, nurse, nutritionist, and a physical education teacher. For tubercu-losis patients, groups could meet to assist in Directly Observed T reatmentShort-course (DOTS). DOTS is the most effective way to assure medicationadherence. Successfully treated patients could return to help current patients,under the supervision of a health professional, if needed. The ranks of \"saluto-genic people\" could be increased with such approaches at very low costs. Suchvolunteers would need educational supplies, a place to meet, and encouragingvisits from professionals to keep activities going. In every community there are already unpaid \"salutogenic people\"\u2014the grand- mother to whom neighborhood children run to be comforted, the respectedwise man to whom people come for advice, the schoolteacher with whom stu- 350 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p351_374_r1 4/7/03 2:41 PM Page 350dents share personal and family concerns. And health workers, too, give valu- able informal services outside their professional roles. How can any of us \"give birth to health\"? There are many ways; here are some: Offer accurate information about health promotion, how to reduce risk fac- tors, how to increase protective factors, and about family and self-care. Dothis simply and clearly. Find ways to motivate the desire for better health, and to believe it is attainable. Listen to people, and help them find their own solutions to the problems theyface. Do not push behavioral prescriptions to people who are not ready forthem. Help identify barriers to people's good health or health behavior change.Cooperatively discuss possible ways to overcome them. Model a healthy lifestyle yourself\u2014no self-destructive habits. Be healthy.Look healthy. (Sumo wrestlers do not make convincing dietitians.) Encourage reduction or resolution of conflicts, particularly if they affecthealth behavior, the safety of the immediate environment, or entail chronicpsychoemotional or interpersonal turmoil. These can lead to physiological,psychological, and/or behavioral ill health in those involved. Often, the \"salu-togenic person\" will let the person \"pour out the problem,\" which in itself ishelpful. Depending on the nature of the conflicts, the \"salutogenic person\"may urge one or more of the people involved to seek appropriate help\u2014froma family friend, a friend of both parties, a social or religious advisor. The\"salutogenic person\" should ordinarily refer the problem and not get involvedpersonally, lest it diminish her or his other health efforts. Let people know you care about them and their family's health and wellbeing. You cannot respond to all kinds of problems, and you cannot alwaysresolve the ones you do respond to. You are not a physician, a psychiatrist, alawyer, or a rescuer. But you can be a coach and help people consider somealternatives. And, most of all, convey that you care about their well being andwellness, and will do what you are able. Link people who can help each other. It may be as simple as finding a babysit-ter while a mother goes to clinic. This is like \"making referrals,\" but it is usu-ally non-professional and quite informal. It is best to discuss the matter firstwith the person to whom the referral will be made to see if the idea is ac-ceptable. Self-help groups usually welcome new people. This process increasescommunity engagement and builds \"social capital.\" (Also see the section \"Pove rty\" in Chapter 13.) 351 IS GOOD HEALTH ACHIEVABLE AND SUSTAINABLE?51331_p351_374_r1 4/7/03 2:41 PM Page 351Help people who feel or act socially isolated to connect with others. Follow up to see if the connection continues. T ry to keep relationships reciprocal. If you are able to help someone, allowthem to help you in some way also. You and they will feel more comfortableif there is a two-way give and take, but do steer clear of keeping a tally. Don'ttry to keep things even or remember who owes one more assist to the other.Remember that over the long-term, it will all even out\u2014if it doesn't, that'sOK, too, among friends. As the community program develops over several years, perhaps from amongthe throng of community participants newly educated to nurture health,some 5% or 10% will emerge who have the gifts to become especially salu-togenic. Would it be possible to give them the community recognition thatwould motivate them to continue sharing their gifts? Could they get addi-tional training and materials to upgrade their health work? The burden of disease, disability, and premature death in many places is as big as a mountain. No one approach, no package of programs will take it away. Butwe hope some of the ideas in this Handbook will enable you, and those withyou, to chip off chunks of the problem, a few at a time. And perhaps, peoplelike you on the other side of the mountain will be doing the same. You can bea mover among the \"salutogenic people.\" SAVING LIVES IS MORE THAN REDUCING MORTALITY This Handbook has talked about elementary medical procedures (e.g., how tomix oral rehydration solution), about counseling on sensitive matters (e.g., themixed motives of sexually transmitted illness patients), about community de-velopment, about earthy politics (e.g., name the new water treatment plant afterthe community leader who obtained the funds), about how gross income in-equalities appear to increase a nation's mortality, and about changing cultureson a worldwide scale. Quite a bookful! Why? To what end? To give officials, epidemiologists, and health professionals at all levels the thrill of sharply lowering disability and mortality rates? Yes, thereis a deep sense of reward for saving lives. But saving lives consists of far morethan reducing mortality. Yes, that must be done first, and preventing disabilityis the next great challenge. But whole strata of people in the world today are not motivated to work for fu- ture health, even their own. They spend their life energies to survive, to graspsome pleasure, to make a splash so others will know they existed. Even in youth, 352 BUILDING BETTER HEALTH51331_p351_374_r1 4/7/03 2:41 PM Page 352their vision of the future may be clouded over by people they know who have died, run away, lost jobs, failed their families for reasons beyond their control. Too commonly, such people believe that they are castaways in social environ- ments and economic straits against which they are helpless. They then becomehopeless, alienated. For some, the consequent anger leads to destructiveness andcrime. For others, it leads to living in the moment, because the future is painfulat worst and formless at best. For all of these persons and groups, future healthis too uncertain, too unlikely, to work toward. The basic point is that life must seem worth surviving for, or people will not make the effort to do so. People's efforts must have a reasonable chance of achiev-ing their goals, or they will be redirected to other rewards, perceived as morelikely, more immediate, or more pleasurable. So, saving lives reaches beyond reducing mortality, disability, and morbidity. The good healthy life means growing, learning, developing, living with peoplewho are loving and helpful, and reflecting those behaviors to others. It meansbeing productive in some way, to add a positive touch to the human journey.This expresses incompletely some widely affirmed visions of what humanity canbecome. It goes beyond what the health professions can ever do. It will take allsectors of society and all people of goodwill to make this happen. Healthy people can travel this road more successfully than sick or troubled ones.So, let us begin. 353 IS GOOD HEALTH ACHIEVABLE AND SUSTAINABLE?51331_p351_374_r1 4/7/03 2:41 PM Page 353References and Additional Resources 1.

Behavioral Change BUILDING BETTER HEALTH: A Handbook of Behavioral ChangeC. David JenkinsPan American Health Organization Pan American Health Organization Regional Office of the World Health OrganizationScientific and Technical Publication No. 590 ISBN 92-75-11590-7Building Better Health: A Handbook of Behavioral Change is a one-of-a-kind manual for communities to reduce disease, disability, and premature death throughout the life cycle. It blends proven disease prevention strategies with practical behavioral science principles and methods to create a handy guide that health workers at all levels can use in planning and operating local and regional health programs. The author, C. David Jenkins is an internationally known health worker, researcher and Professor of Preventive Medicine and Community Health, of Epidemiology, and of Psychiatry. He has been a consultant to the World Health Organization, the Pan American Health Organization, and WHO Regional Offices for Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean, and the Western Pacific. Dr. Jenkins' text is lively, enthusiastic, accessible\u2014and anchored in solid science. Wherever in the world health workers fight against disease and disability, this Handbook will become an essential tool. It will be especially useful in the battle against the rising tide of chronic degenerative diseases, lifestyle related diseases, major depression, injuries, and violence. It is a tour de force.... It is succinct, based on science, but understandable; it is enthusiastic; the behavioral change section is outstanding; the relevance to lesser developed countries is clear throughout.... \u2014William R Harlan, M.D. Formerly Associate Director for Disease Prevention National Institutes of Health United States Department of Health & Human Services Dr. Jenkins's book is a one-of-a-kind example of a successful blend of biomedical and behavioral sciences. It has two outstanding pluses: first, the information in it can be interpreted within a theoretical context and, because of that, it can be applied to similar conditions that are not specifically covered in the book; second, the information in this book will have a very long useful life. \u2014Dr. Miguel \u00c1lvarez, Ph.D. Professor, National Institute of Neurology and Neurosciences Havana, Cuba Among [the Handbook's] many strengths is its emphasis on the inseparable nature of the human condition. All disorders, and therefore their prevention, must take into account their biological, psychosocial, and community setting.... The unity of health and behavior, and the carryover of this theme to prevention, is a most important concept for the developing and the developed worlds.This book will be a useful guide for all who work at preventing illness and disability throughout the world. \u2014Dr. Robert Haggerty Professor and Chair Emeritus, Department of Pediatrics, University of Rochester School of Medicine and DentistryPAHOSci.
