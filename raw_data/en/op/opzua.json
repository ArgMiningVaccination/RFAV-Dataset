Typically full of protein and other essential nutrients, this fermented dairy product may be best known as a source of gut-loving [probiotics](/probiotics/guide/). It's also extremely versatile in the kitchen, with different varieties and a range of culinary uses, from baking to marinades to sauces. Common Questions & Answers What Is Yogurt Exactly? [Stephanie Nelson, RD](https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/author/stephanie-nelson-rd/), a lead nutrition scientist with [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/). \"As the milk ferments into yogurt, the sugar in the milk gets broken down into lactic acid by the bacteria, which gives yogurt its tangy flavor.\" Like the milk products used to make it, yogurt can vary in the amount of fat it contains, from nonfat (0 percent) to low-fat (2 percent) to whole milk (4 percent). \"Fat in dairy provides that creamy texture, much like how whipped cream is thicker than milk,\" Nelson explains. Then there's Greek yogurt, which is the product of straining the liquid from regular yogurt. Greek yogurt can be nonfat, low-fat, or full-fat, but in general it has a thicker, creamier texture than regular yogurt. Straining also makes some of the nutrients in the yogurt more concentrated, says Nelson, which is why Greek yogurt usually contains more protein. What Are the Nutrition Facts for Yogurt? Calories, Carbs, Sugar, and More [source of protein](/diet-nutrition/protein-how-much-you-need-benefits-sources-more/), calcium, and [potassium](/pictures/foods-high-in-potassium/).

A Look at Its Health Benefits Because yogurt is so high in protein, it can support muscle strength and bone health, says Brittany Modell, RD, the owner of [Brittany Modell Nutrition and Wellness](https://www.brittanymodellrd.com/) in New York City. \"Protein is the building block of muscles, bones, cartilage, skin, and blood,\" she says, adding that it also helps you feel fuller for longer. [digestive health](/digestive-health-pictures/superfoods-that-help-digestion.aspx)by restoring the [gut microbiome](/digestive-health/gut-microbiome/)with the \"good bacteria\" it needs. [gastrointestinal](/digestive-health/common-digestive-conditions-from-top-bottom/)system working properly, a varied and balanced assortment of these healthy bacteria appear to have wide-ranging effects on many aspects of health, from immunity to skin conditions. \"Probiotics have been shown to clear infections from the gut, resolve imbalances, have anti-inflammatory properties, and promote a healthy immune system,\" says Angie Asche, RD, a nutritionist at [Centr](https://centr.com/centr). Can Yogurt Help With Weight Loss? [insulin resistance](/type-2-diabetes/insulin-resistance-causes-symptoms-diagnosis-consequences/), and increasing satiety. Aside from its probiotic powers, yogurt's high protein content makes it filling. Plus, it's easily customizable and hard to grow bored with when you want to drop pounds. \"You can play with the protein, [carbohydrate](/carbohydrates/guide/), fat, fiber, and sugar content based on what yogurt you use and what you mix into it,\" says Nelson. \"In general, protein and fiber are super important for weight loss because they make you feel full and preserve your muscle mass when you're losing weight.\" Of course, the yogurt included in a weight loss plan should contain little to no added sugar, says Asche, but you can sweeten it with fresh fruit and boost fiber with flaxseeds or granola. How to Eat and Store Yogurt Recipes With Yogurt Yogurt doesn't have to appear in a parfait, nor is it exclusively a breakfast food. These recipes provide just a few of many alternatives. - This [5-Minute Healthy Strawberry Frozen Yogurt](https://www.justataste.com/5-minute-healthy-strawberry-frozen-yogurt-recipe/)from Just a Taste combines fresh strawberries, yogurt, and honey to create a healthier, lighter version of ice cream that's the perfect summer treat. - Few sauces are better than [homemade tzatziki](https://therealfooddietitians.com/homemade-tzatziki-sauce-recipe/), and here, the Real Food Dietitians throw it together with just yogurt, oil, cucumber, and some fresh herbs. - Make lunch healthier (and higher in protein) with Alena Menko's [Greek Yogurt Tuna Salad](https://www.alenamenko.com/tuna-salad-with-greek-yogurt-no-mayo/), which gets its moisture from yogurt instead of mayonnaise. - This coconut-milk-yogurt-based [berry smoothie](https://www.eleatnutrition.com/recipes/gut-healthy-berry-smoothie?rq=yogurt)from Eleat Sports Nutrition is a gut healthy way to start your day. - Eleat also has yogurt find its way into a healthier version of [mac and cheese](https://www.eleatnutrition.com/recipes/mac-and-cheese?), with an extra-creamy sauce. Side Effects of Yogurt [Yoplait's Original Strawberry](https://www.yoplait.com/products/original-single-serve-strawberry)has only 2 g of fat but has a whopping 19 g of sugar, with 13 g added. That's over a tablespoon!\" Saturated fats are also hidden in some brands' recipes, adds Nelson. As we know, diets high in sugars and saturated fats elevate the [risk of heart disease](/heart-disease/), diabetes, chronic inflammation, and more. Then there's the stomach-rumbling side effects that lactose (the sugars in milk) can have on those who are lactose-intolerant. \"If you're sensitive to dairy, try yogurt with caution and in a small amount at first,\" says Nelson. \"If you're at risk for heart disease, definitely stick to the lower-fat options.\" Other Uses for Yogurt Although yogurt's primary purpose is to be eaten, its fermented goodness can have other convenient functions. You can use the creamy concoction as: - A brightening, smoothing face mask The live bacteria in yogurt naturally produce lactic acid, an alpha hydroxy acid commonly found in exfoliating skincare products. For that reason, research shows it can be an effective anti-aging and acne treatment. - A moisturizing hair conditioner Although research has not proven the [benefits of yogurt](https://www.everydayhealth.com/digestive-health/gut-check-are-all-yogurts-created-equal/)as a hair mask, it has long been used as a home treatment in the Middle East. In one study, yogurt was the most widely used home treatment for hair among Saudi Arabian women. - Brass or copper polish Lactic acid eats away at any tarnish to reveal a good-as-new shine. - An at-home yeast infection remedy The lactobacillus bacteria in yogurt has been found to combat vaginal yeast overgrowth. A 2015 study published in the Global Journal of Health Science compared the effectiveness of antifungal vaginal cream to a mixture of yogurt and honey. The findings concluded that the two had similar effects, and that the yogurt mixture was even more effective in treating some symptoms. But some doctors warn against the topical use of yogurt, as it contains natural sugars that may encourage further yeast production. Always consult your primary care physician before attempting any home treatment. Summary When it's not candy-coated or loaded with additives, yogurt can be a protein-boosting addition to breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Not only will it offer creaminess to any dish, its fermented nature provides essential probiotics. Plus, you can choose from a variety of types, from Greek-style to plant-based.
