The prime-boost method uses two vaccine components\u2014a relatively harmless virus that delivers HIV proteins and primes the immune system, followed by booster shots of the HIV proteins themselves. This one-two punch approach activates both antibody and cell-mediated immune responses. The goal of the group's four-year study is to build upon the success of the prime-boost approach and to explore vaccine designs that may generate protective antibodies targeting the part of the virus it uses to bind to immune cells\u2014the part widely considered the Achilles heel of the virus. HIV infects more than 2 million people globally each year. Throughout the world, an estimated 33 million people are living with HIV/AIDS. While antiretroviral therapy can control progression of HIV to AIDS, it cannot cure or stop the spread of the disease. "}
