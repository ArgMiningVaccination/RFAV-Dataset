Before a trial starts, it is recommended or, in many cases, required that the protocol is deposited in a trial register (see Chapter 7, Section 5). Until recently, there has not been specific guidance as to exactly what items should be included in such a protocol. However, such guidance has recently been published (Chan et al., 2013a; Chan et al., 2013b) as a component of the EQUATOR project (Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research) (< [http://www.equator-network.org/](http://www.equator-network.org/)>). The publications include a 33-item checklist, the so-called SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Intervention Trials) 2013 checklist, which is reproduced in Table 4.1. This gives a useful outline of how a trial protocol might be organized, bearing in mind the issues we have discussed in this chapter. Readers should refer to the SPIRIT website (< [http://www.spirit-statement.org/](http://www.spirit-statement.org/)>) for the most recent version. Table 4.1 The SPIRIT 2013 checklist: recommended items to address in a clinical trial protocol and related documents* |Section/item||Item no.||Description| |ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION| |Title||1||Descriptive title identifying the study interventions, and, if applicable, trial acronym| |Trial registration||2a||Trial identifier and registry name. If not yet registered, name of intended registry| |2b||All items from the World Health Organization Trial Registration Data Set| |Protocol version||3||Date and version identifier| |Funding||4||Sources and types of financial, material, and other support| |Roles and responsibilities||5a||Names, affiliations, and roles of protocol contributors| |5b||Name and contact information for the trial sponsor| |5c||Role of study sponsor and funders, if any, in study design; collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; and the decision to submit the report for publication, including whether they will have ultimate authority over any of these activities| |5d||Composition, roles, and responsibilities of the coordinating centre, steering committee, endpoint adjudication committee, data management team, and other individuals or groups overseeing the trial, if applicable (see item 21a for data monitoring committee)| |INTRODUCTION| |Background and rationale||6a||Description of research question and justification for undertaking the trial, including summary of relevant studies (published and unpublished) examining benefits and harms for each intervention| |6b||Explanation for choice of comparators| |Objectives||7||Specific objectives or hypotheses| |Trial design||8||Description of trial design, including type of trial (for example, parallel group, crossover, factorial, single group), allocation ratio, and framework (for example, superiority, equivalence, non-inferiority, exploratory)| |METHODS: PARTICIPANTS, INTERVENTIONS, AND OUTCOMES| |Study setting||9||Description of study settings (for example, community clinic, academic hospital) and list of countries where data will be collected. Reference to where list of study sites can be obtained| |Eligibility criteria||10||Inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants. If applicable, eligibility criteria for study centres and individuals who will perform the interventions (for example, surgeons, psychotherapists)| |Interventions||11a||Interventions for each group with sufficient detail to allow replication, including how and when they will be administered| |11b||Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions for a given trial participant (for example, drug dose change in response to harms, participant request, or improving/worsening disease)| |11c||Strategies to improve adherence to intervention protocols and any procedures for monitoring adherence (for example, drug tablet return, laboratory tests)| |11d||Relevant concomitant care and interventions that are permitted or prohibited during the trial| |Outcomes||12||Primary, secondary, and other outcomes, including the specific measurement variable (for example, systolic blood pressure), analysis metric (for example, change from baseline, final value, time to event), method of aggregation (for example, median, proportion), and time point for each outcome. Explanation of the clinical relevance of chosen efficacy and harm outcomes is strongly recommended| |Participant timeline||13||Time schedule of enrolment, interventions (including any run-ins and washouts), assessments, and visits for participants. A schematic diagram is highly recommended (see figure at < | *Reproduced with permission of the SPIRIT group. It is strongly recommended that this checklist be read in conjunction with the SPIRIT 2013 Statement (Chan et al., 2013a), in order to fully understand the scope and context of the checklist. It is important to note that this is a minimum list of items, and certain trial protocols may warrant the inclusion of additional items.
