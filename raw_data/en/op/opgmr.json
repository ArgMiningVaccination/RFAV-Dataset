He spoke of it as \"a path of knowledge, to guide the spiritual in the human being to the spiritual in the universe\". The aim of this Annual is to publish writings which bring the outlook of Anthroposophy to bear on questions and activities of the present time. The title derives from a reference by Rudolf Steiner to an old Persian legend. \"Djemjdid was a king who led his people from the north towards Iran, and who received from the God, whom he called Ahura Mazdao, a golden dagger, by means of which h e w a s t o f u l l h i s m i s s i o n o n e a r t h I t represents a force given to man whereby he can act upon and transform external nature\".A Lecture given at Dornach on April \\3th, 1919* F * 0 M t h e t w o p r e c e d i n g l e c t u r e s y o u w i l l h a v e r e u s e d t h a tin nding it necessary to speak at the present time of the threefold social order, anthroposophical spiritual science is notactuated by any subjective views or aims. The purpose of thelecture yesterday was to point to impulses deeply rooted in the hfeof the peoples of the civilised world\u2014the world as it is in this Fifth Post-Atlantean Epoch. I tried to show how, from about the year 1200 A.D. onwards, there awakened in Middle Europe an impulse leading to the growth of what may be called the civic social order ,but that this civic social life of the middle classes was inltrated by the remains of a life of soul belonging to earlier centuries\u2014by those decadent Nibelung traits which appeared particularly among the ruling strata in the mid-European countries. I laid special stress upon the existence of a radical contrast in mid-European hfe from the thirteenth until the twentieth centuries, culminating in the terrible death-throes of social life that have come upon Middle Europe. This incisive contrast was between the inner,soul-life of the widespread middle-class, and that of the descendantsof the old knighthood, of the feudal overlords, of those in whom vestiges of the old Nibelung characteristics still sursayed. Theselatter were the people who really created the political hfe of Middle Europe, whereas the bulk of the middle class remained non-pohtical a-poUtical. If one desires to be a spiritual scientist from the practic^point of view , serious study must be given to this diff^ence of som-Ufe between the so-called educated bourgeoisie and all those who held any kind of ruling positions in Middle Europe at that time. I spokeof this in the lecture yesterday. We wiU now consider in rather greater detail why it was tlmtthe really brilliant spiritual movement which lasted from the timeof Walter von der V ogelweide until that of Goetheanism and then a b r u p t l y c o U a p s e d , f a i l e d t o g a i n a n y i n fl u e n c e o v e r s o c i d h f e o r t op r o d u c e a n y t L u g h t s w h i c h c o u l d h a v e b e e n f r a t f u l i n t h a t s p h e r e .Even Goethe, with all his power to unfold great, all-embracing ideas * \u00ab i v l e c t u r e s .

Fundamentally speaking, the tendency towards the threefold membering of a healthy social organism was already present in human beings, subconsciously, by the end of the eighteenth century. The demands for freedom, equality and frat ernity, which can have meaning only when the threefold social order becomes reality, testied to the existence of this subconscious longing. Why did it never really come to the surface ? T h i s i s c o n n e c t e d w i t h t h e w h o l e i n h e r e n t c h a r a c t e r o f m i d - European spiritual life. At the end of the lecture yesterday I spoke of a strange phenomenon. I said that Hermann Grimm\u2014for whom I have always had such high regard and whose ideas were able to shed light upon so many aspects of art and general human interests of bygone times\u2014succumbed to the extraordinary fallacy of admiring such an out-and-out phrasemonger as Wildenbruch ! In the course of years I have often mentioned an incident which listeners may have thought trivial, but which can be deeply indicative for those who study life in its symptomatological aspect. Among the many con versations I had with Hermann Grimm while I was in personal contact with him, there was one in which I spoke from my own point of view about many things that need to be understood in the spiritual sense. In telling this story I have always stressed the fact that Hermann Grimm's only response to such mention of the spiritual was to make a warding-off gesture with his hand, indicating that this was a realm he was not willing to enter. A supremely true utterance, consisting of a gesture of the hand, was made at that moment. It was true inasmuch as Hermann Grimm, for all his penetration into many things connected with the so-called spiritual evolution of mankind, into art, into matters of universal human concern, had not the faintest inkling of what 'spirit' must signify for men of the Fifth Post-Atlantean epoch of culture. He simply did not know what spirit really is from the standpoint of a man of this epoch. In speaking of such matters onemust keep bluntly to the truth : until it came to the spirit, there was truth in a man like Hermann Grimm. He made a parrying gesture because he had no notion of how to think about the spirit. Had he been one of the phrasemongers going about masked as prophets to-day endeavouring to better the lot of mankind, he would have believedthat he too could speak about the spirit; he would have believed that by reiterating Spirit, spirit, spirit! something is expressed that has been nurtured in one's own soul. Among those who of recent years have been talking a great dealabout the spirit, without a notion of its real nature^ are the theoso- phists\u2014the majority of them at any rate. For it can truly be saidthat of all the vapid nonsense that has been uttered of late, the theosophical brand has been the most regrettable and also in acertain respect the most harmful in its effects. But a statement likethe one I have made about Hermann Grimm\u2014not thinking of him as a personality but as a typical representative of the times\u2014raises the question : how comes it that such a true representative of Middle European life has no inkhng of how to think about the spiritual,about the spirit ? It is just this that makes Hermann Grimm the typical representative of Middle European civilisation. For when we envisage tliis brilliant culture of the townsfolk, which has its startabout the year 1200 and lasts right on into the period of Goetheamsm, we shall certainly perceive as its essential characteristic\u2014but wthout valuing it less liighly on this account\u2014that it is impregnated m thebest sense with soul but empty of anything that can be called spint. That is the fact we have to grasp, with a due sense of the tragedy of it: this brilliant culture was devoid of spirit. What is meant here,of course, is spirit as one leams to apprehend it through anthroposo- phical spiritu^ science. A g a i n a n d a g a i n I r e t u r n t o H e r m a n n G r i m m a s a r e p r e s e n t a t i v e personality , for the thinking of thousands and thousands of scholarlymen in Middle Europe was similar to Ws. Hermann Grimm wrote an excellent book about Goethe, containing the substance of lectureshe gave at the University of Berlin in the seventies of the last centu^. T aking it all in all, what Hermann Grimm said about Goethe is re^ythe best that has been said at this level of scholarship. From tl^ vantage-point of a rich life of soul, Hermann Grimm denved his giftnot only for portraying individual men but for accurately discerningand assessing their most characteristic traits. He was brilhant m hitting upon words for such characterisations. Take a simp eexample. In the nature of things, Hermann Gn^m was one ofthose who misunderstood the character of the wild Nibelung people. He was an ardent admirer of Frederick the Great ^d pictureda s a G e r m a n i c h e r o .

W efeel: this is an extraordinarily good, a reaUy splendid piece of wntmg\u2014only it is not Goethe ! In reality it gives only a shadow-picture of Goethe, as if out of a three-dimensional gure one were to make a two-dimensional shadow-picture, thrown on the screen. Goethe seems to wander through the chapters like a ghost from the year 1749 to the year 1832. What is described is a spectral Goethe\u2014not what Goethe was, what he thought, what he desired. Goethe himself did not succeed in lifting to the level of spiritual consciousness all that was ahve within his soul. Indeed, the great 'Goethe problem' to-day is precisely this : to raise into consciousness in a truly spiritual way what was spiritually alive in Goethe. He himself was not capable of this, for culture in his day could give expression only to a rich life of the soul, not of the spirit. ThereforeHermann Grimm, too, rmly rooted as he was in the Goethean tradition, could depict only a shadow, a spectre, when he wantedto speak of Goethe's spirit. It is thoroughly characteristic that the best modem exposition of Goethe and Goetheanism should produce nothing but a spectre of Goethe. Why is it that through the whole development of this brilliant phase of culture there is no real grasp of the spirit, no experience ofit or feeling for it ? Men such as Troxler, and Schelhng too a.t times, pointed gropingly to the spirit. But speaking quite objectively, itmust be said that this culture was empty of spirit. And because of this, men were also ignorant of the needs, the conditions, that are essential for the life of the spirit. Here too there is something which may well up as a feeUng of tragedy from contemplation of thisstream of culture : men were unable to perceive, to divine, the con ditions necessary for the hfe of the spirit, above all in the social sphere. For the reason why the social life of Middle Europe has developed through the centuries to the condition in which it nds itself to-dayis that it had no real experience of the spirit, nor felt the need to meet the fundamental requirement of the spiritual life by emancipating it, malng it independent of and separate from the political sphere.Because men had no understanding of the spirit, they allowed it tobe merged with the political life of the State, where it could unfold only in shackles. I am speaking here only of Middle Europe ; in otherregions of the modem civihsed world it was the same, although the c a u s e s w e r e d i f f e r e n t . And then, in the inmost soul, a reaction can set in. Then a man can experience how in his study of nature the spirit remains dumb, silent, uncommunicative. Then the soul rebels, gathersits forces and strives to bring the spirit to birth from its own inmost being! This can happen only in an epoch when scientic thinking impinges on a culture which has no innate disposition towards spixituaUty . For if men are not inwardly dead, if they are inwardlyalive, the impulse of the spirit begins of itself to stir within them. We must recognise that since the middle of the 15th centu^ the spirit has to be brought to birth through encountering what is dead if it is to penetrate into man's hfe of soul. The only persons who can gain satisfaction from inwardly experiencing the spiritualised soul- life of the Greeks are those who, with their classical scholarship, live in that afterglow of Greek culture which enables the soul-quahty of the spirit to pulsate through a man's own soul. But men who are impelled to live eamestly with natural science and to discem whatis deathly, corpse-like in it\u2014they will make it possible for the spirit itself to come ahve in their souls. If a man is to have real and immediate experience of the spirit in this modem age, he must hot only have smelt the fumes of pmssic acid or ammonia in laboratories, or have studied specimens extracted from corpses in the dissecting room, but out of the whole trend and direction of natural scientic thinking he must have known the odour of death in order that through this experience he may be led to the light of the spirit! This is an impulse which must take effect in ourtimes ; it is also one of the testings which men of the modem age must undergo. Natural science exists far more for the purpose of educating man than for communicating truths about nature. Only a naive mind could believe that any natural law discovered by learned scientists enshrines an essential, inner trath. Indeed it does not! The purpose of natural science, devoid of spirit as it is, is the education of men. This is one of the paradoxes imphcit in the historic evolution of humanity. And so it was only in the very recent past, in the era after Goetheanism, that the spirit ghmmered forth ; for it was then, for the rst time, that the essentially corpselike quality in the ndings of natural science came to the fore ; then and not until then could the spirit ray forth\u2014for those, of course, who were willing to receive its light. Until the time of Goethe, men protected themselves against the sorry effects of a spiritual hfe shackled in State-imposed restric tions by cultivating a form of spiritual hfe fundamentally ahen to them, namely the spiritual hfe of ancient Greece; this was outsidethe purview of the modem State for the very reason that it had nothing to do with modem times. A makeshift separation of the spiritual hfe from the pohtical sphere was provided by the adoption of an ahen form of culture. This Greek culture was a cover for the spiritual emptiness of Middle European hfe and of modem Europe in general, On the other hand, the need to separate the economic sphere from the Rights-sphere, from the pohtical hfe of the State proper, was not perceived. And why not? When all is said and done, nobody can detach himself from the economic eld. T o speak trivially, the stomach sees to that! In the economic sphere it is impossible for men to hve unconcemedly through such catadysms as are aUowed to occur, ah unnoticed, in the pohtical and spiritualspheres. Economic activity was going on all the time, and it developed in a perfectly straightforward way. The transformationof the old impenetrable forests into meadows and cornelds, with all the ensuing economic consequences, went steadily ahead. But into economic hfe, too, there came an alien intrusion, one that had actually found a footing in the souls of men in Middle Europe earlierthan that of Greece, namely the Latin-Roman influence. Everything pertaining to the State, to the Rights-life, to political hfe, derivesfrom this Latin-Roman influence. And here again is something that wiU have to be stressed by history in the future but has been overlooked by the conventional, tendentious historiography of the immediate past, with its bias towards materiaUsm\u2014the strangely incongruousfact that certain economic ideas and procedures are a direct develop ment from social relationships described, for example, by Tacitus, as prevaihng in the Germanic world during the rst centuries after the founding of Christianity. But that is not all. These trends in economic thinking did not go forward unhampered. The Roman view of rights, Roman political thinking, seeped into the economic usages and methods originally prevaihng in Europe, inltrated them through and through andcaused a sharp cleavage between the economic sphere and the pohtical sphere. Thus the economic sphere and the pohtical sphere,the former coloured by the old Germanic way of hfe and the latter by the Latin-Roman influence, remained separate on the surface butwithout any organic distinction consistent with the threefold member- ing of the body social \\ the distinction was merely supercial, a mask.Two heterogeneous strata were intemungled; it was felt that they did not belong together, in spite of external unication. In wardly, however, people were content, because in their souls they experienced the two spheres as separate and distinct. One need only study mediaeval and modern history in the right way and it wiU be clear that this mediaeval history is really thestory of perpetual rebelhon, self-defence, on the part of the economic relationships surviving from olden times against the political State, against the Roman order of hfe. Imaginative study of these thingsshows unmistakably how Roman influences in the form of jurisprudence penetrate into men via the heads of the administrators. A greatdeal of the Roman element had even found its way into the wild Nibelung men in their period of dechne. \"Graf is connected with\"grapho\"\u2014writing. One can picture how the peasants, thinkingin terms of husbandry, rise up in rebellion against this Roman juridical order, with sts clenched in their pockets, or with flails.Naturally , this is not always so outwardly perceptible. But whenone observes history truly , these factors are present in the wholemoral trend and impulse of those times. And so\u2014I am merely characterising, not criticising, for everything that happened hasalso brought blessings and was necessary for the historic evolution 6of Middle Europe\u2014aU that developed from the seeds planted in mid- European civilisation was permeated through and through by the juristic-political influences of the Roman world and the humanismof Greece, by the Greek way of conceiving spirit in the guise of soul. On the other hand, directly economic life acquired its modem, international character, the old order was doomed. A man might have had a very good classical education and be an ignoramus in respect of modem natural science, but then he was inwardly on a retrograde path. A man of classical education could not keep abreastof his times unless he penetrated to some extent into what modem natural scientic education had to offer. And again, if a man were schooled in natural science, if he acquired some knowledge of modem natural science and of what had come out of the old Roman juristic system in the period of which I have spoken, he could not help suffer ing from an infantile disease, from 'culture scarlet fever', 'culture measles', in a manner of speaking. In the old Imperium Romanum a juristic culture was tting and appropriate. Then this same juristic principle, the res publica (i.e. the conception of it), was trans planted from ancient Rome into the sphere of Middle European culture, together with the element of Nibelung barbarism on the other side.One really gets 'culture scarlet fever', 'culture measles', if one does not merely think of jurispmdence in the abstract, but, with sound natural scientic concepts, delves into the stuff that gures as modem jurispmdence in literature and in science. We can see that this state of things had reached a certain climax when we nd a really gifted man such as Rudolf von Ihering at an utter loss to know how to deal with the pitiable notions of jurispmdence current in the modem age. The book written by Ihering on theaim of justice {Der Zweck im Recht) was a grotesque production, for here was a man who had made a little headway in natural scientic thinking endeavouring to apply the concepts he had acquired to jurisprudence\u2014the result being a monstrosity of human thinking.T o study modern literature on law is a veritable martyrdom for sound thinking ; one feels all the time as though so many worms were crawl ing through the brain. This is the actual experience\u2014I am simply describing it pictorially. We must be courageous enough to face these things fairly and squarely , and then it will be clear that we have arrived at the pointof time when not only certain established usages and institutions, but men's very habits of thought, must be metamorphosed, re-cast ; when men must begin to think about many things in a different way Only then will the social institutions in the external worldbe able, under the influence of human thinking and feeling, to take the form that is called for by these ominous and alarming facts. 7A fundamental change in the mental approach to certain matters of the highest importance is essential. But because between 1200 and the days of Goetheanism, modem humanity, especially in Middle Europe, absorbed all unwittingly thoughts that wriggled throughthe brain like worms, there crept over thinking the lazy passivity that is characteristic of the modem age. It comes to expression in the absence of will from the life of thought. Men allow their thoughts to take possesion of them ; they yield to these thoughts ; they prefer to have them in the form of instinct. But in this manner no headway can be made towards the spirit. The spirit can be reached only by genuinely putting the will into thinking, so that thinking becomesan act like any other, like hewing wood. Do modem men feel that thinking tires them ? They do not, because thinking for them isnot activity at all. But the fact that anyone who thinks with thoughts, not with words, will get just the same fatigue as he getsfrom hewing wood, and actually in a shorter time, so that he simply hjis to stop\u2014that is quite outside their experience. Nevertheless, this is what will have to be experienced, for otherwise modem mankind as a community will be incapable of achieving the transition from the sense-world into the supersensible world of which I spoke in the two preceding lectures. Only by entering thus into the super sensible world, with understanding for what is seen and apprehended in the spirit, human souls nd harmony again. The year 1200 is the time of Walter von der Vogelweide, the time when the spiritual Ufe of Middle Europe is ^tir with powerful imagin ations of which conventional history has little to say. Then it flows on through the centuries, but from the 15th and 16th centuries onwards takes into itself the germs of decline with the founding of the Uni versities of Prague, Ingolstadt, Freiburg, Heidelberg, Rostock, Wurzburg and the rest. The founding of these Universities throughout Middle Europe occurred almost without exception in a single century. The kind of life and thinking emanating from the Uni versities started the trend towards abstraction\u2014towards what was subsequently to be idolised and venerated as the pure, natural scientic thinking which to-day invades the CTistomary ways of thought withsuch devastating results. Fimdamentally speaking, this gave a denite stamp to the whole mentality of the educated middle class. Naturally, many individualswere not deeply influenced, but all the same the effect was universal. Of salient importance during this period was the increasing receptive- ness of people to a form of soul-life entirely foreign to them. Side by side with what was developed through those who were the bearersof this middle-class culture, which reached its culmination in Goethe, Herder and Schiller, alien elements and impulses were at work. I am speaking here of something profoundly characteristic. In their souls, the bearers of this culture were seeking for the spirit without a notion of what the spirit is. And where did they seek it ? 8In the realm of Greek culture 1 They leamt Greek in their inter mediate schools, and what was instilled into them by way of spiritual substance was Greek in tenor and content. To speak truly of the spirit as conceived in Middle Europe from the thirteenth right on intothe twentieth century, one would have to say: spirit, as conveyed by the inculcation of Greek culture. No spiritual life belonging intrinsically and innately to the people came into being. Greekculture did not really belong to the epoch beginning in the middle of the 15th century, which we call the epoch of the evolution of self- consciousness. And so the bourgeoisie in Middle Europe were imbued with an outworn form of Greek culture, and this was the source of all that they were capable of feeling and experiencing in regard to the spirit. But what the Greek experienced of the spirit was merely its expression in the life of soul {Seelenseite des Geistes). What gave profundity to the culture of ancient Greece was that the Greek roseto perception of the highest manifestation of soul-life. That was what he called 'spirit'. True, the spirit shines down from tie heights, pulsing through the realm of soul; but when the gaze is directed upwards, it nds, to begin with, only the expression of the spirit in the realm of soul. Man's task in the Fifth Post-Atlantean epoch, however, is to lift himself into the very essence of the spirit\u2014an attainment still beyond his reach in the days of Greece. This is of far greater signicance than is usually supposed, for it sheds light upon the whole way in which medieval, neo-medieval culture apprehended the spirit. * * What, then, was required in order to reach a concept, rni inward experience, of the spirit appropriate for the modem age? It is precisely by studjdng a representative gure Mke Hermann Grimmthat we can discover this. It is something of which a man such as Hermann Grimm, steeped in classical lore, had not the faintest inlfling namely, the strivings of natural science and the scienticmode of thinking. This thinking is devoid of spirit; precisely where it is great it contains no trace of spirit, not an iota of spirituality. All the concepts of natural science, all its notions of laws of nature, are devoid of spirit, are mere shadow-pictures of spirit; while men are investigating the laws of nature, no trace of the spirit is present in their consciousness. Two ways are open here. Either a man can give hiinself up to natural science, contenting himself\u2014as often happens to-day\u2014with what natural science has to offer; then he will certaiidy equip his mind with a number of scientific laws and, ideas concerning nature\u2014 but he loses the spirit. Along this path it is possible to become a truly great investigator, but at the cost of losing all spirituality. 9Th at is the one way. The other is to be inwardly aware of the tragic element arising from the lack of spirituality in natural science, precisely where science appears in all its greatness. Man imnierses his soul in the scientic lore of nature, in the abstract, unspiritual laws of chemistry, physics, biology, which, having been discovered atthe dissecting table, indicate by this very fact that from the living they yield only the dead. The soul delves into what natural sciencehas to impart concerning the laws of human evolution. When a man allows all this to stream into him, when he endeavours not to pride himself on his knowledge, but asks : 'What does this really giveto the human soul?'\u2014then he experiences something true; then spirit is not absent. Herein, too, lies the tragic problem of Nietzsche,whose life of soul was torn asunder by the realisation that modern scientic learning is devoid of spirituality. As you know , insight into the supersensible world does not depend upon clairvoyance ; all that is required is to apprehend by the exerciseof healthy human reason what clairvoyance can discover. It is not essential for the whole of mankind to become clairvoyant; but what is essential, and moreover within the reach of every human being, is to develop insight into the spiritual world through the healthy human intelligence. Only thus can harmony enter into souls of themodem age ; for the loss of this harmony is due to the conditions of evolution in our time. The development of Europe, with her American afnities on the one hand and the Asiatic frontier on the other, hasreached a parting of the ways. Spiritual Beings of higher worldsare bringing to a decisive issue the overwhelming difference between former ages and modern times as regards the living side-by-side of diverse populations on the earth. How were the peoples of remote antiquity distributed and arranged over the globe ? Up to a certain point of time, not long before the Mystery of Golgotha, the conguration of peoples on earth wasdetermined from above downwards, inasmuch as the souls simply descended from the spiritual world into the physical bodies dwellingin some particular territory . Owing to physiological, geographical, climatic conditions in early times, certain kinds of human bodies were to be found in Greece, and similarly on the peninsula of Italy. The souls came from above, were predestined entirely from above, and took very deep root in man's whole constitution, in his outer, b o d i l y p h y s i o g n o m y . , ,Then came the great migrations of the peoples. Men wandered over the earth in different streams. Races and peoples began to intermix, thus enhancing the importance of the element of heredityin earthly life. A population iiihabiting a particular region of the earth moved to another; for example the Angles and Saxons who were living in certain districts of-the Continent migrated to theBritish Isles. That is one such migration. But in respect of physical heredity, the descendants of the Angles and Saxons are dependent upon what had, developed previously on the Continent; this wasa determining factor in their bodily appearance, their practices, and so forth. Thus there came into the evolutionary process a factor working in and conditioned by the horizontal. Whereas the distributionof human beings over the earth had formerly depended entirely upon the way in which the souls incarnated as they came down from above, the wanderings and movements of men over the earth now also began to have an effect. At the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries, however, a new cosmic- historic impulse came into operation. For a period of time a certain sympathy existed between the souls descending from the spiritual world and the bodies on the earth below. Speaking concretely; souls who were sympathetically attracted by the bodily form and constitution of the descendants of the Angles and Saxons, now living in the British Isles, incarnated in those regions. In the 15th century this sympathy began to wane, and since then the souls have no longer been guided by racial characteristics, but once again by geographical conditions the kind of climate, and so forth, on the earth below, and also by whether a certain region of the earth is flat or mountainous. Since the 15th century , souls have been less and less concerned with racial traits once again they are guided more by the existing geo graphical conditions. Hence a kind of chasm is spreading throughthe whole of mankind to-day between the elements of heredity and race and the soul-element coming from the spiritual world. And if men of our time were able to lift more of their subconsciousness into consciousness, very few of them would\u2014to use a trivial expression \u2014feel comfortable in their skins. The majority would say : I ^me down to the earth in order to live on flat ground, among green tlungsor upon verdant soil, in this or that kind of chmate, and whether I have Roman or Germanic features is of no particular importance to me. It certainly seems paradoxical when these things, which are ofp a r a m o u n t i m p o r t a n c e f o r h u m a n l i f e , a r e c o n c r e t e l ^ y d e s c n b e dMen who preach sound pnnciples, saying that one should abjuremateriaUsm and turn towards the spirit\u2014they too talk just bke thepantheists, of spirit, spirit, spirit.

T h i scomparision is no mere analogy, but is founded upon facts of the spiritual life.To all this must be added that, precisely through the spiritual evolution of modem times, man is becoming more and more spiritual in the sphere of his subconsciousness, and the materialistic trend in his upper consciousness is more and more sharply at variance with the impulses that are astir in his subconsciousness. In order to Tmderstand this, we must consider once more the threefold membermg of the human being. . . When the man of the present age, whose attention is mrected only to the material and the physical, thinks of this threefold mem- berlng, he says to himself: I perceive through my senses; they areindeed distributed over the whole hody but are really centralised m the head; acts of perception, therefore, belong to the hfe of the nerves and senses\u2014and there he stops. Further observatmn will, of course, enable him to describe how the human being breathes, andhow the life passes over from the breath into the movement of the heart and the pulsation of the blood. But that is about as far as ahe gets to-day . Metabolism is studied all detail, but not as one of the three members of threefold man; actually it is taken to be the whole man. One need not, of course, go to the lengths of the scient ic thinker who said: man is what he eats {Der Mensch tst, was er tssrt\u2014but, broadly speaking, science is pretty strongly convincedthat it is so. In Middle Europe at the present time it looks as if he will soon be what he does not eat!

Translated by Dorothy Osmond.HOW OLD IS THE EARTH X* G., Wachsmuth. T h e h i s t o r y o f m e n ' s e f f o r t s t o d i s c o v e r t h e a g e o f t h e e a r t h ,and to describe its evolution, has itself a characteristic history, for both the concept of time and the concept of matter have undergone considerable changes. It is signicant that in earhertimes the entire history of the earth was thought to occupy only a few thousand years. The Biblical story of creation, for instance, allows only six thousand years'\u2014although the m5rth-filled thinking of those days had different conceptions of such time-units\u2014while the Chaldean, Chinese and Indian cosmologies allowed for greater depths of time. In the nineteenth century the gures ran intomillions (Lord Kelvin and others), and in the rst half of the twentieth century there was a leap into billions (thousand millions), and todaythe minimum age of the earth's crust is estimated as lying between two and three thousand million years. AU this is closely connected with changes in the ideas of the nature and structure of the world, and of matter. With the appearance of an atomistic picture of the world; foreshadowed in the ideas of Leukippus and Demokritus in ancient Greece, there came an erawhich applied these concepts in a one-sided way , in terms of fund amental particles, thereby eliminating what is most important m the formation of the world. This approach starts from inorganic events and physical-chemical points of view, instead of from the living whole. These ideas about the structure and processes of the smallest entities were then transferred to cosmology and to the history of the earth, Thus the critical turning-point is the transition to a picture of the world in which the inorganic is regarded as the primary and determining factor in evolution. And here is to be found the problem which future research will have to resolve : whether anytrue picture of the development of the world can be arrived at by the one-sided application of laws observed in inorganic processes. The greatest difculty in calculating ages and periods of tune arose from the fact that there seemed no possibility, until recently, of establishing any absolute scale. Only relative values could be obtained from the geological ideas of the last centiury ; that is to say , it was possible to determine only whether a particular geolo^cal stratum was older or younger than another, and these calculations From Beitrage zwr Substam-Forschung, Natural Science Section, Verlag, Domach and Stuttgart.were often hindered by the metamorphoses, folds and thrusts which had taken place in the earth's crust. Palaeontology, the study of the evolutionary stages of variouscreatures, was even less able than geolo^ to furnish an absolute time-scale, since the rates of development in different types of plant and animal, as they made their successive appearances and died out, varied greatly. No single development could be taken as a valid unit in relation to the others, and it was therefore impossible to calculate the total period involved. The recently-developed method of pollen-analysis can give useful results for single periods and strata, but again it can determine only relative time-scales. A way out of these relative time-scales seemed suddenly to be offered by the discovery of radioactivity, and by the assumption that the radioactive decay of substances proceeds regularly under unalterable laws, and that on this basis absolute time-scales could be calculated. It was assumed that this physical process, the decay of substance, had continued steadily and without interruption through out the history of the earth, and from the present rate of this process, time-scales were calculated for the most distant past. Even though different workers gave different estimates, the jump into astronomical gures arose from the logic of the method used. Radioactive elements such as uranium and thorium change gradually into isotopes of lead through the splitting off of electrons and helium ions from their unstable nuclei. Thus, from the present rate of decay of these elements, and from the proportion of lead isotope to the corresponding radioactive element, a calculation was made of the ageof radioactive minerals, of the rocks of which they are part, and thence of the earth's crust. Schindewolf,* in a survey of the various methods of age-determination, emphasises with some reason that many of these calculations are valid only for the so-called igneousrocks in which the radioactive minerals are formed, and cannot be applied in the same way to sedimentary rocks. Here we encounter the important question of the earlier formation of the earth's crust from outside and inside, which I have discussed elsewhere.* From the isotopes in lead-ores, and using the methods described above. Holmes recently estimated the age of the earth as 3,300 million years, though critics objected that these minerals were found in graniteformations and could not be taken as indicating the total age of the earth, since these strata were not formed until the development of the earth as a planetary body had proceeded for some time. Voitkevich, using calculations based on the age of meteorites, estimated 5,000 million years as the age of uranium 235. These will serve as examples of modem methods of determining geological time. asterisk in the text means that the work mentioned is included in the list of reference^ at the end.However , the fundamental point here is whether these methodsstart from a valid assumption. What we have rst to ask is whether this decay of matter has gone on from the very beginmng. or whether it dates from a later stage of evolution ; and whether the process has proceeded steadily , or has passed through phases of varying intensity .Only when this preliminary question has been cleared up can one askif the current reckonings of the age of the earth are justied. It is possible that quite different gures may emerge. The decisive issue at this stage, therefore, is whether modern ideasabout physical events in matter (i.e. an inorgamc point of view)are applicable to the whole of the earth's early development, or whether this development in fact proceeded according to orgamcl a w s , w i t h i n w h i c h i n o r g a n i c p r o c e s s e s - ^ s p e c i a l l y t h o s e o f r a J o -a c t i v e d e c a y - h a v e o p e r a t e d o n l y o v e r a h m i t e d e l d a n d a h m i t e dperiod.

Kienle* characterisedthis with the analogy , all too appropriate to-day , of an exploding shell. Nevertheless, other workers have emphasised that this phaseof expansion may be a temporary condition, alternating with an opposite process. Umbgrove* writes : 'The discovery that theuniverse is expanding (which de Sitter rst suggested in 1917 on theoretical grounds) is one of many possible solutions of a mathematical equation. One solution is that formerly the universe was consider ably condensed, and that since then it has continually expanded.Another solution is that the universe is subject to alternate phases of contraction and expansion, a pulsating movement\". A similar alternation of periods of shrinking and expanding is suggested to explain the remarkable changes of hght-intensity inthe so-called variable stars. Hinks* writes : \"The speeds of increase intensity do not arise from movement in a circularpath, but from a pulsation of the star, a regular expansion and contraction, the extent of which is about a sixth of the star's radius\". In the cosmos there exist countless possibilities and variations of expansion and contraction phases. In 1923 Rudolf Steiner indicated that the phases can be quite short, and that the spaces between the xed stars have increased during recent centuries, but that a new phase will follow in which the constellations will draw together. In my book, (^.-E*.), there is described a \"pulsating, breathing movement of contraction and expansion in which the cosmic system as a whole undergoes phases of systole and diastole, an organic development. At this point we must turn again to modern views on fundamental particlp. An analogy is often drawn between the structure of theatom (with its electrons circling at relatively long distances fromthe nucleus) and the structure of the cosmos ; and from the decay of me former are drawn conclusions concerning events in the latter. However, if we start from the whole, out of which these fundamental partides have gradually condensed, the opposite question arises.I o what extent can the phases of expansion and contraction, the centrifugal and centripetal tendencies in the cosmic eld of forces give us information, rst about the working of these forces in the eldof fundamental particles ; secondly as to whether radioactive decay IS a process continuing uniformly throughout evolution, or whether It arose at a particular point in the development of the whole ?

The wthdrawal of the moon, (which up to that time had promoted the solidication tendencies inthe whole mass) inaugurated a phase in which centrifugal, expanding, loosening forces could become dominant. This is illustrated byvarious phenomena of the period, such as the clearing of the atmos phere, the appearance of new plants, and the development of giantanimal forms, all of which went on during the Jurassic and Cretaceous. Further it was shown {E.E.) how this phase of renewed plasticity persisted until about the end of the T ertiaiy and the beginning of the Quartemary , and then gave way to a ^eno6.olmaximal contraction,solidication and mineralisation, leading to the present condition of t h e e a r t h ' s s t r u c t u r e . During this phase the elements were rst resolved out of their previous organic combination. At the same time, certain portionsof matter exceeded the maximum of this centripetal process, and there began that phase of decay which is found in radioactive processes.The general expansion of the universe which is inferred from the Doppler effect, and also the expansive, centrifugal processes of racho- activity in the smallest units of matter, began only with the Quarter- nary. If an attempt is made to determine a time-scale on the basisof this picture of cosmic and earth evolution, calculations drawn from the decay of radioactive substances can apply only \u00ab far back as the early stages of the Quaternary. Even so, it remains an open question whether the process was steady and continuous during this period. Its intensity could have varied without affectingthe nal result. The conclusions drawn, for exainple, from discolora- tions in the immediate surroundings of ra(hoactive deposits are not the last word, if considered in conjunction with organic points of view. For instance, a fruit which has ripened fast and early may be similar in nal form and size to one which has ripened late and slowly , although the speeds of the two processes were different. T o start from proces ses of old age, and argue back to processes of youth, may easily lead to mistaken conclusions, where higher organic processes are con cerned. Finally , there remains the question whether, during the early stages of evolution, the isotopes attributed to radioactivity couldhave arisen in any other way\u2014perhaps as a result of (Erect cosmic factors. In any case, absolute time-scales cannot be derived from the present laws of radioactive processes', in the way often assumed to-day . 20There is, however, a cosmic time-factor which can be of help in determining time-scales. This is the platonic year an(i its phases, marked by the movement of the point of sunrise at the spring equinox through the signs of the zodiac in a cycle of 25,920 years. If this cycle is divided into twelve (a division which is not schematic, butarises directly from the signs of the Zodiac), one nds that, as is shown elsewhere {E.E., tables III and XI), the decisive periods in the Quaternary, discussed above, correspond to the movement of the equinoctial point through the signs of Libra and \"Virgo ; that is, interms of time, to a period lying between 15,000 B.C. (entry into Libra) and 13,800 B.C. (entry into Virgo). During this period the radioactive decay which is observable today, rst began. In a lecture given on 5th October, 1905, Rudolf Steiner said: \"In earlier times atoms were progressively hardening ; now, however, they are coming more and more apart.. Previously there was no radioactivity. It has existed only for a few thousan<i years, becauseatoms are now splitting up increasingly.\" In using the term \"atom\" on that occasion, Rudolf Steiner certainly did not want to conne himself to the present conceptionsof atomic structure. The essential point is the short period of t i m e s i n c e t h e b e g i n n i n g o f r a d i o a c t i v i t y. I t w a s s h o w n above that an absolute time-scale can be calculated only in connec tion with this relatively short phase of centrifugal processes. In considering the \"age of the earth\" on the basis of radioactive decay, the perioii available comprises some 14-15,000 years before the beginning of historical time. From this standpoint, the gures forthe total evolution which have been theoretically calculated in millions and billions, bear no relation to reality. In connection with the point of maximum condensation and the subsequent decay-processes, it is necessary to emphasise further acircumstance which the writer has already described\u2014that the phase in which the equinoctial point passed through the sign of Virgo corresponded to a phase in the earth's passage through the eclipticwherein its axis (or rather the northern tropic) turned towards the sign of Sagittarius. As described in detail elsewhere {E.E. pp.l32f) many phenomena indicate that specic forces reach the earth from the cosmic eld of Sagittarius, (the conjectured centre of the galaxy, where is found the greatest assemblage of interstellar gas and dust- clouds, nebulae, anci meteor-swarms etc.) This has recently been conrmed by observations with radio instruments. In the above- mentioned work {E.E.), the coming of the Quaternary ice age was associated with the phase in which the earth became orientated towards the sign of Sagittarius. At this point began the subsequent periods during which decay processes appeared in particular substances in the earth (i.e. in those which had passed the point of maximum centripetal condensation), and which expressed themselves in that form of centrifugal dissolution which 21is found, in radioactivity. Radioactive decay, therefore, must be considered as a process which has developed since the beginning of the Quaternary, and is governed both by cosmic impulses and by the stage of development of specic substances in the earth. * * * A further point to bear in mind is that for the earliest stages of of the evolution of the earth, the ''year\" cannot be taken to signify a constant unit of time. The movement of the earth around the ecliptic, which is the basis of this unit, must have been quite differentboth in shape and in time during the period, for example, when the moon was still united with the earth. From this point of view, also, the theoretically calculated gures of millions and billions of years fail to give a true picture of the evolutionary process. In the same way, obviously, the platonic year has not always had the same vahdity as a unit of time. Before the earth had developed its present form, the movement of the point of sunrise at the spring equinox was naturally different. The platonic unit of time can be apphed only as far back as the transition from the 'Lemurian' to the 'Atlantean' age,\u2014that is, from the Mesozoic to the Tertiary. Before that, the single evolutionary steps required several platonic years, and in the earliest stages they had a very differentcharacter and relation to time. In order not to over-simplify our calculations, which would mean losing touch with actual events, it is necessary, and more in tune with reality, to transform both our ideas and our measurement of time, if we are to form a picture of the early stages of .the earth's evolution. If we attempt a more exact approach, we nd that the ostensibly 'absolute' time-scales which appear to be indicated by the inorganic process of radioactivity are of no use to us ; and that the knowledge gathered up to the turn of this century, which made possible the determination of relative time-scales from the results of geological and biological research, has still to be improved upon. However, we can considerably advance our knowledge by applying consistently an organic point of view. The phenomena themselvesshow that the laws of the whole cannot be derived from the smallest entities, or from dead, inorganic processes. Rather is it necessaryto consider higher systems of organisation, such as determine the development, rhythms, dynamics and different phases of the whole,both in its totality and in its several parts, right down to those which have sunk into the inorganic. Schindewolf*, after surveying the usual physical and biologicalideas, comes to the following conclusion : \"There remains the questionas to the nature of the impulse, the factor 'x', or perhaps even a factor- complex, 'x, y,z', which steers and controls evolutionary, and perhapsalso historical, events.\" Similarly, we need above all to determine the unknown 'factor', or 'biotropic factor', which has so often been 22sought in dynamic and rhythmic processes, and in living nature.In my book, E. M., it was shown how this question may be answered if one takes into account those higher organisations of formative forces which work in the spheres of earth and cosmos, as well as in plant, animal and man, and which form a consistent basis for an organic consideration of the genesis of the cosmos and of the history of the earth. * * * On this basis, also, it is possible to consider the future. The picture which arises is not one of dying, decaying processes in cosmosand earth, or of a dead-end of maximum entropy, but rather of upbuilding processes, of directional organic metamorphoses which bring the entire organisation of the system on to new and higherlevels of development. Here and there it is already being shown theoretically that we are fully justied in tracing the working of spiritual, soul and life forces right down to the fundamental particles.Thus Whitehead* writes : \"Science is taking on a new aspect which is neither purely physical, nor purely biological. It is becoming the study of organisms. Biology is the study of the larger organisms ;whereas physics is the study of the smaUer organisms The concrete enduring entities are organisms, so that the plan of the whole influences the very characters of the various subordinate organisms which enter into it. In the case of an animal, the mentalstates enter into the plan of the total organism, and thus modify the plans of the successive subordinate organisms until the ultimate smallest organisms, such as electrons, are reached. Thus an electron within a living body is different from an electron outside it, by reason of the plan of the body. The electrons blindly runs either within or without the body ; but it runs within the body in accordance with its character within the body; that is to say, in accordance with the general plan of the body , and this plan includes the mental state.\" What is here said of the animsd, that the smallest particles conform to the total pattern of organisation, in which functions of spirit and soul (\"mental states\") play their part, applies even more to man. Rudolf Steiner often described how within the human organism, whose level of organisation transcends the material processes, there occurs a transformation of substance which will increase in scale, and also in its importance for larger wholes. And even if it is assumed that specic substances and parts of our world system (i.e;, those which were subjected to the maximum of centripetal, condensation forces, and are now undergoing an extreme centrifugal process of decay) fall away from the further organic evolution of the wholeand undergo a sort of death, or dissolution, process\u2014nevertheless, this cannot by itself detennine the development of the whole on a higher level of organisation, where processes of growth and newcreative impulses are continually to be seen at work. 23Particular laws of nature thus have their beginning, their period of validity, and their end. From time to time the evolution of the whole reaches stages when it undergoes periods of higher, spiritual development and receives new principles. Hence, in in vestigating the 'age of the earth', we must not take into account only processes of death and decay. They certainly occur, but theyare not the sole determinant of evolution and phases of time. Processes of new growth, rejuvenating processes, are also apparent; and in them we can discern how, through countless phases and conditions of form, life and consciousness, a continual rebirth, a development to a higher stage, a living metamorphosis and ascent, are active in the organism of the earth, and in the higher organism of the cosmos.

Can we believe these accounts of Christ Jesus, as we have them ? Do our translations give an accurate rendering of the originals ? And must not the texts on which they are based bearthe marks of many alterations and errors during the rst centuries ? Above all, how faithful to the facts were the Evangelists themselves ? Immense labour has been given to the study of the existing early texts and fragments of texts. For the Gospels, the most valued authorities remain the Sinaitic and Vatican codices, which are ascribed to the fourth century. Considerable parts of the Gospels have also been found on papyri written early in the third century. But thousands of Greek versions, as well as early Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations, together with quotations from the Gospels foundin the writings of early Fathers of the Church, have been studied and their variations compared. The general result of this study has been to show that all four Gospels must have existed, in texts resembling very closely those we have, quite early in the second century. Sir Frederic Kenyon can say (referring to the New Testa ment) : \" The last foundation for any doubt that the Scriptures have come down to us substantially as they were written has now been removed.\" This does not mean that there are not still signicant uncertainties in detail. The greatest of these concerns the ending of St. Mark's Gospel, where it is generally agreed that we have the original Gospel only up to XVI, 8, ending \"and they were afraid . . . \" ; that some thing unknown happened at this point causing our text to break oflE;and that alternative endings were added later, though these were already known in the second century. It is also held on textual grounds that the account of the woman taken in adultery, though part of genuine tradition, does not belong where it stands in St. JohnVIII. Both these passages were already regarded as uncertain by the early Fathers. Otherwise, the variations to be found are many, andare sometimes interesting and illuminating, but in general they alter the sense, even in detail, very little. We have, therefore, something extremely close to the original Greek texts. There is no room for the extensive re-editing that has often been conjectured. But the question about the reliability of the Evangelists themselves leads into a realm about which there is verymuch less external evidence. Until fairly recently, it was almost taken for granted, by many learned critics, that much distortion and invention must have occurred between the time of Christ's life and the time when the Gospels were written. We often meet the procedure(found continually in Dr. Bames* book, \"The Rise of Christianity\")that the critic takes as fundamental the kind of Christ Jesus in whom he can believe, and of whom he can approve, and then cuts away from the Gospels as unhistorical everything that does not t in with this picture. Such criticism has had, and continues to have, wide influence, particularly upon teachers. During the last twenty-five years or so \u2014 a landmark is \"TheRiddle of the New Testament\" by Sir Edwyn Hoskyns and F. N. Davey, published in 1931 \u2014 there has been a strong reaction againstthis method. It has been pointed out that we have the right to describe a \"Christianity before the Gospels\" only if we can nd evidence for its actual existence. And the more exactly the documents of the New Testament have been studied, the more closely knit they have proved to be. 'Tt is now more commonly recognized . . . that itis impossible to drive a wedge between Jesus' own life and teaching and the subsequent interpretation of him by the Church\" \u2014 thus Professor A. M. Ramsey sums up one of the conclusions reached in this way. We cannot separate out, as was often thought, a Christianitywithout the Resurrection, without a unique relationship of Christ to the Father, without the fullment of Old Testament prophecy, without healing miracles. All these are so intimately woven into the fabric of any original Christian teaching of which we have evidence, into the discourses of Jesus, and into what we know of apostolic proclamation of the Word, that what is left, if these are removed,can only be the arbitrary product of modern prejudices, a thing without life. In bold antithesis to this whole school of nineteenth-century criticism, and with the condence that he has the most careful and open-minded research behind him. Dr. E. V. Rieu can say today (in the introduction to his Penguin translation of the Four Gospels) : \"Just as Jesus lived in the oral tradition that preceded the Gospels,so he inspired and unied the writings that eventually summed it up. One might almost say that Jesus wrote the Gospels\". All four Gospels were written, it is now widely agreed, between about 60 and 110 A.D., in circles where there were many who had been in close contact with direct disciples of Jesus, and who preserved abundant detailed traditions about Him. They were written in an atmosphere intensely sensitive about the exactness of any accountof events which were seen as the most signicant that had ever happened, or could ever happen. For the early Christians, however,it was impossible to separate exactness in description from under standing of the meaning of the events; they regarded the Evangelists as accurate because they understood.Here we come to the fundamental difculty of modern criticism, and mdeed of modern reading, of the Gospels. It has long been held, and is regarded as certain today, that the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke were written considerably before that of John. Thus if.as the evidence of papjnus fragments suggests, St. John's Gospel cannot have been written later than about 90-100 A.D., the others must be not far from the decade 60-70. Now until recent years the rst three Evangelists were generally regarded as simple narrators, who put together the traditions and documents available to them rather uncritically, and who altered, if they did alter, for compara tively obvious reasons ; in order, for example, not to offend or puzzle Gentile readers, and not to record anything that might seem to diminish the glory of their Master. St. Paul and St. John were seen as theo logians, the Synoptists as chroniclers. But it is evident now that even Mark, who seemed to offer the plainest, most primitive account, gave his Gospel an extremely subtle and complex structure, the reasons for which are by no means immediately accessible to us. Each Evangelist is an artist-theologian ; and we stand as modern men before writers with a profoundly different consciousness from ours, whose every word is shaped by this consciousness. They have, for example, an ancient wisdom about number. InSt. John's Gospel it is manifest that the whole is composed in sequences of seven, and that each number mentioned has its signic ance. St. Mark's Gospel, too, is built up in rhythms of three and twelve. But we shall not understand such numbers simply by recalling what they meant to Pythagoras, or in Chaldaea; for tothe Evangelists aU ancient wisdom has been radically transformed by the coming of the Christ. Thus, though the Evangelists wrote indeed in the Greek of the market-place, a language that had become cosmopolitan and trivial,the knowledge that has been accumulated in recent years about the contemporary use of this language is only of limited service in the understanding of the Gospels. We are told what words meantoutside the Christian stream. But just as the Christians felt them selves reborn through Baptism, citizens of a new world, strangers to the old world about them ; in the same way each word, each thing of Nature taken for use as parable, was baptised too, plunged into a n e w w i s d o m . St. Mark describes, as a crucial experience of the most intimate discipies, the event called the Transguration. The beginning ofthis passage is rendered by Dr. E. V . Rieu : \"Six days later Jesus selected Peter, James, and John, and took them up, privately and alone, to the top of a high mountain. There he was transformed before them and his clothes began to glisten with whiteness such as no fuller on earth could achieve. And now Elijah appeared to them, with Moses \u2014 they were talking with Jesus. Whereupon Peter said to Jesus : 'Rabbi, it is a good thing that weare here. Let us make three shelters, one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah'. He did not know what to do or say, for they were overcome with awe. Then came a cloud which enveloped them, and a voice came out of the cloud : This is My Son, the Beloved One. Listen to him'.\"The next moment, looking round, they saw no one with them but Jesus\".If we take such a passage seriously, it is full of mysteries. Certain disciples are chosen, in order that they may be led further into the understanding of Christ. On \"a high mountain\" they pass through an experience, in which it appears that three different levels of consciousness are involved; the everyday level, one in which they see as companions of Jesus men not physically on earth, and one in which they hear the voice of God. The disciples have great difculty in nding a right relationship to the experience of these different levels ;and what Peter says is connected with this difculty. How can a translation suggest all the implications of the little word skene, here rendered \"shelter\" ? It is a tent built of branches \u2014 but it is also the tabernacle of God, and the human body as dwelling-place of the spirit ; and such implications are not arbitrary additions \u2014 they are essential parts of the New T estament use of the word. St. Peter, we might say ,is struggling with the problem of how a spiritual experience can be incarnated, brought rightly to earth. It is the artists, in particular such men as Fra Angelico and Raphael, who have been able to do justice to this scene, rather thanthe theologians. Raphael, especially, including in his picture the boy suffering from convulsions, has emphasised the contrast between the earthly world, with its chaos and sickness in the foreground, and theexalted world of vision upon the mountain, from which healing must be brought. In order to approach the Gospels with understanding today, we need therefore some guide to the different levels of consciousness from which the events they describe are drawn. It is to this result that the movement in modem historical study, which tries not to criticise the Gospels away through materialistic prejudice, but to enter into theirreal mood and meaning as a whole, must lead if it is consistently developed. And the healthiest, most comprehensive account of the transformation of human consciousness, in order that it may become directly aware of spiritual realities, has been given in our time by Rudolf Steiner. # * * Again and again, from different points of view, Rudolf Steinerdescribes how our capacity for thinking can be so strengthened and intensied that it becomes a living in pictures, which is as much more wakeful than our daily existence as this is more wakeful than our dreams. Through such active picturing we share in forces that are really at work in the world, forming all that lives. But beyond this faculty of spiritual Imagination, as Rudolf Steiner calls it, we need a power that can be compared with hearing, as the rst with seeing :tme Inspiration, which enters into a prepared consciousness that is able to empty itself of the Imaginations already achieved. Through Inspiration, a much more intimate relationship with the beings of the spiritual world is attained than by Imagination alone \u2014 a sharing of 28their inward purpose and intention. Through real Intuition, the third level of developed consciousness, the soul becomes capable of uniting and identifying itself at times with the very essence of another being. In the account of the Transguration, we can see that the chosen disciples are momentarily lifted from the Imaginative consciousness,with which they beheld Moses and Elijah beside Jesus, into Inspiration, and then return to the level of physical sight. Similarly, if we go from the rst three Gospels to the Fourth, wend reflected, in the whole difference of style and treatment, the distinction between a consciousness predominantly Imaginative and one that is completely at home in Inspiration. The parables met constantly in the rst three Gospels are Imaginative pictures ; in theFourth they disappear almost completely, and we are listening for the most part to Christ speaking directly about his own Being. This is the real contrast between John and the Synoptists, a contrast which has been such an endless puzzle to critics. (How St. Luke himself indicates this, is made clear by Rudolf Steiner in the rst lecture of his book, \"The Gospel of St. Luke\", which has been published in English). We have here a fundamental, far-reaching clue to the origin of the Gospels. By the developed consciousness, many of the limitations which beset everyday knowledge are overcome. Wilham Blake, for example, or Jacob Boehme, and many others, could claim that gures and events of the remote past lay open to their perception. We need not here examine how far in these cases the perception was exact \u2014 only that it was regarded as possible. Rudolf Steiner spoke of a kind of reading in the World-memory, the \"Akashic Record,\" accessible to Imagination and Inspiration. The New Testament points to this possibility in its own way. The early Christians, to whom it had been promised that the Holy Spirit would bring all the deeds of Christ to mind in them, didnot feel this promise limited to events at which they had been physi cally present as individuals, and which they might have forgotten through the normal weakness of human memory. Just as St. Paul says that his knowledge of what happened at the Last Supper is the result of a direct revelation to him, so a number of intimate disciples felt that they were able to look back and see events in the life of Christ at which no other human being was physically present, for example the Temptation and Gethsemane. \u00ab 4 e In what form did the traditions exist, which were already present among the Christian congregations before the Gospels were written ?A great deal of study has been given to this question, particularly by that German school of critics which has taken \"Formgeschichte\" as its leading principle. But it is by no means only a literary or learned question ; it leads us toward the heart of early Christian experience.We can put it now in a different way : for what purposes would the Apostles wish to express their memory-visions of the life of Christ, this holiest realm of their soul, in xed forms of words ? The written v29word was felt as something of a profanation, in comparison with the Hving spoken word. The earliest Christian documents, the Epistles, very rarely indeed refer to any particular incident in the life of Christ,or quote any of his Sayings. But the same applies to the examples of preaching given in the Acts, which should give a correct impres sion in this respect; they deal with the fundamental fact of Christ's coming, gi^dng no details, and with the practical consequencesfor the hearers. A good example is the Epistle of St. James, which has very much the character of a sermon. Where, then, would the beUeverhear something directly about Christ's words and deeds ? In a lecture given at The Hague on April 13th, 1922, Rudolf Steiner spoke of the teaching given by the Risen Christ to the disciples. Very Uttle has reached us, either through the Gospels or through other traditions, about this. Rudolf Steiner describes as a central element in this teaching the instruction given by the Christ about the celebration of the Holy Eucharist, through the four stages which are still recognis able in the Mass : the reading of the Gospel, the Offering, the Trans- substantiation, and the Communion. The disciples were shown how these four stages lead to the realization of man's eternal being. In the Communion, the spiritual forces which master the material, and usually remain deeply unconscious in man, are led into consciousness. And since the Resurrection man can leam here how he shares in Christ's conquest of death. The description given by Rudolf Steiner of the place of the Eucharist in the teaching of the Risen Christ is derived from the reading of the Akashic Record, and not from tradition; But Lie. Emil Bock has pointed out the relevance of what we are told about James, the B r o t h e r o f t h e L o r d . This James must be distinguished both from the Son of Zebedee, and from the Son of Alphaeus mentioned in lists of the Twelve. James, the ''brother of Jesus\", had at rst during the Three Years a detached and critical attitude. And yet. Paul speaks of a particular appearance of the Risen Christ to him, and of his decisive leadership in the Church at Jerusalem. St, Jerome quotes from a lost Gospel of the Hebrews a passage describing how after the Crucixion James fasts until the C h r i s t c o m e s t o h i m :\" 'Bring ye', saith the Lord, 'a table and breM'; and immediately it is added : He took bread and blessed and btake and gave it unto James the Just and said unto him : 'My brother, eat thy bread, forthe Son of Man is risen from among them that sleep'.\" From his special experience of the mystery of the Altar after the Resurrection, we may understand James's position of leadership. Now one consequence of this whole picture of the place of the Sacrament at the very beginrung of the Mfe of the Christian Church is this : there must have been words about the Christ's life, spoken during the rst stage of the Eucharist, where later a pasisage from oneof the Gospels was read, long before the Gospels we know were written,There must have been passages describing deeds and sajdngs of Christ proclaimed in this hoHest place, as preparation for Offering, Transsubstantiation, and Communion, before there was a Mark,a Matthew , a Luke, or a John Gospel from which such passages could be taken. It would be here that believers could gradually form a detailed picture of the Life otherwise described so sparingly; here that they could listen to words spoken by Apostles, or the pupils of Apostles, as Christ's own words living in them, and cleansing as theyare spoken all human speech. From this we may begin to understand much better both the likeness and the unlikeness of the Gospels to each other. No-one could easily alter words that had already grovm dear and famihar in this way, over a period of something like thirty years. ^ And yet each Evangelist had also before him his own living, developing vision of the events of Christ's life, towards which he felt himself responsible. In the light of his Imaginative and Inspired experience he must shape the words that had already become traditional and make them into a continuous and harmonious whole, which could serve the needs of the future, sustaining the Church through approaching dangers. In uttermost tension of soul this task must have been fullled. * * * The origin of the first three Gospels must be connected \u2014 whether as comfort given before, or soon after the blows fell \u2014 with a series of great losses to the Church. St. James \"the Just\" was martyred at Jerusalem about A.D. 62.; St. Peter and St. Paul at ^ome m 64 or 65 ; Jerusalem was destroyed in 70. It seems likely , too, that the death of the Mother of Jesus, for which no date is know, tell about this time, or a little earlier. Tradition suggests that the 1 welve were already widely scattered through the world, that she had livedfor some time with John at Ephesus, and then returned tc^erusal^. She would have been about 87, if she had lived until A.D. 70. The passing of each of these great witnesses, and of the city tlmt wasitself a witness and participant, made consecutive written Gospels more necessary. There seems no strong reason for questioning that St. Mark, the secretary-interpreter of St. Peter, and St. Luke, the physician whosometimes accompanied St. Paul, were the authors of the Gospels attributed to them, and that St. Luke also wrote the Acts. St. Mark is said to have gone after St. Peter's death to Alexandria, and to have been martyred there ; and Rudolf Steiner said that the impression of decadent and materialistic culture, which Mark received in Egypt, helped him to give his Gospel the right, decisive colouring. It isthe Gospel which describes Christ in his innitely courageous power of wm. A detailed study of St. Mark's Gospel has appeared recently (1952), which conrms the intimate relationship of the Gospels to theEucharist. It is \"The Primitive Christian Calendar\", by Dr. P. 80 31Carrington, Archbishop of Quebec. Dr . Carrington suggests that thewhole Gospel consists of short passages arranged for each Sunday of the year, with a longer continuous narrative for the time of the Passion. This suggestion is supported by divisions in the text indicated m the Codex Vaticanus (quite distinct from our chapter divisions, which are mediaeval), by ancient lectionaries, and by the relationship of the readings to the Jewish ritual year, at a time when the Christian festivals were only beginning to take shape, and it had to be proved that the Christians held the answer to all the longings which the Jewish festivals expressed. Thus Mark may have had as basis the \"Gospel readings\", or rather proclamations, used in the course of the year by Peter himself. St. Luke was under the powerful influence of St. Paul, though the effects of this influence do not lie on the surface. In the gentle ness of the Third Gospel, we meet a soul not connected to any one nation either through special loyalty, or special opposition to it.Luke is concerned with the healing power of Christ that is needed byall humanity . It is often thought that he must have sought out the Mother of Jesus ; during the Renaissance he was sometimes repres ented as painting her portrait. His Gospel will have been a deep comfort to those stricken by her death. The authorship and origin of \"St. Matthew\" are beset with riddles. The earliest tradition speaks of him writing in Hebrew; the Gospel we have, like the rest, seems clearly to have been composed in Greek. It is argued that it depends on Mark, as the work of an eye-witness, one of the Twelve, would not do. If Matthew's dependence is not really on Mark, but on formula tions having Peter's authority, the case is altered; for Peter, as we have seen, was a member of the inner group chosen out by Christ from among the Twelve. Further, the decisive concern of the Evangelists was not with what had once been seen with physical eyes, but mth what can always be seen, looking back, with spiritualvision. \"Matthew\" would be less occupied with his own physical experience than with the greatest wisdom to which he could ndaccess. His Gospel is like an answer to the question, \"How did the whole Hebrew tradition nd both its fullment, and the uttermost refutation of its errors, through Christ Jesus ?\" It is in this Gospel that we nd most often that events are said tohave fulfilled what was written by the prophets \u2014 even that they happened in order to full sayings which to the modern reader appear to have meant in their original context something entirelydifferent. \"Out of Egypt have I called my Son,\" for example, seems to refer quite plainly and simply to the original Exodus under the leadership of Moses ; what need to apply it to the boyhood of Jesus ?And the further objection can be raised that this view of prophecy renders free human action meaningless.And yet this Gospel, which is so deeply conscious of the Law , alone records completely the Sermon on the Mount, in which a standard of human action is given that cannot conceivably be achieved by obedience to any external admonition, but only by free self- e d u c a t i o n . , . , X 1 - The key to this difculty can be found in the story, pyen by Matthew alone, of the Magi from the East who come seekmg the Child Jesus. They have seen it written in the starry scnpt that this child is to be born. The prophets on earth are only secondary; the original writing, which these reflect, is in the stars. Ttere the heavenly archetypes, which can be fullled in manifold wa;^ by men,are to be read; and the greatest freedom may be the aclueyement of deeds by which the starry ideals are reahsed on earth. This very saying, \"Out of Egypt have I called my Son,\" descnbes the emergenceo f t h e f r e e s p i r i t f r o m a w o r l d o f e x t e r n a l r u l e s a n d c o n v e n t i o n s , w h i c h has to be accomplished over and over again. Of this, both the original Exodus \u2014 for the Mosaic Law is by no means simply external,but intimately connected with the development of individual consciousness and responsibility \u2014 and the return of Jesus from Egypt are examples. . ,The writing of the Gospels themselves was seen m very e^ly times as itself a free fullment of what is written in the stars, torthe four Gospels were associated with pictures of the four carnal points of the Zodiac; Mark with the LionBull (Taurus), Matthew with the Man (Aquarius), and John with the Eagle (Scorpio). NaturaUy , this aUocation ^ has seemed veiyarbitrary and articial to most modern critics. What has the gentleL u k e o f a b u l l ? . j - u j . No interpretation can exhaust the meanmg of such pictures,on which the imagination of men has dwelt through centuries, cutcertain ways of approach may perhaps be suggested. Through the coming of Christ, the natural forces in man, whichwork both in his body and in his soul, can pass through a metamor- nhosis The storrav powers of his will can be transformed, and become,rnt paient of suf fering, and nally the abiUty to he^. About the time of Christ, many saw the linage of this process in the buU sacriced by Mithras. And St. Luke describes the greatest imaginable example of the natural wiU-poWers sacnced ^d transfmrmedrai itself ^ alternationof blind courage and panic fear , in all the restless ups and downsof the heart; transformed, it ch^p into the purposeful ser^ce ofthe great rhythms of the world. St. Mark has bp thought clumsya n d r e p e t i t i 4 , w h e n h e s a y s \" E v e m n g c a m e a n d w h e n t h e s u n h a d set \" But he is concerned to emphasize the mysterious relation ship\" o'f the Christ to the rhythms of the sun. It is Mark alone who saysof Easter morning : \"they reached the tomb as the sun rose . From the heart that receives Christ's Sun-power, a new kind of will can spring.St. Matthew , the Man-Gospel, describes the completest harmony of thinking, feeling, and willing ; the condition of freedom. This theme extends from the three gifts of the Magi, at the beginning, to the institution of the sacrament of baptism in the Name of the Trinity by the Risen Christ at the end. * * When Matthew, Mark, and Luke composed their Gospels, wecan be almost certain that the Gospel of the Eagle was not yet written. But they may well have known that it would come, since John was alive : that he would one day see that his unique under standing of the words and deeds of Jesus was committed to writing.Can we suppose that the rst three Evangelists did not in some sense consult John about what could and could not be written by them ?Such consultation would not necessarily mean a physical visit, though there would be no particular improbability about this under the circumstances of the time. If St. Luke sought out Mary, he might well have found John as well. But when the Fourth Gospel was written, something of the effectof the earlier Gospels, at least within the particular Churches and regions in which they originated, could be assessed. Just as the earlier Gospels attempt to correct by the context possible misunderstandingsof particular stories \u2014 as when Luke lets the story of the Good Samar itan be followed by the incident of Martha and Mary , so that it should not be thought that external helpfulness is enough \u2014 so St. John silently corrects and completes the earlier Gospels. It has long been a crux in the appraisement of the Fourth Gospelthat it alone records the raising of Lazarus. If such an outstanding event happened, at a time, not long before the Passion, when there are othe^se very few miracles recorded \u2014 why are the other Gospels silent ? There is no difculty about this if we accept RudolfSteiner's statement \u2014 of which abundant confirmation can be foundin the Gospel, once we have the key \u2014 that Lazarus is really John himself as he passes through an initiation where Christ is the Hierophant. The Fourth Gospel here describes its own source:an event which had to be kept silent until John himself determinedthe time and manner for it to be made known. Through the detachingof the life forces from their normal adherence to the physical body when Lazarus is laid into the grave, he can be endowed with the fulness of the power of Inspiration. The Eagle Gospel has on the one hand the great cosmic width and sweep that we nd particularly in the Prologue and in the seventeenthchapter , the High-Priestly Prayer ; we hear the language of Eternity .It has also the most intimate and individual personal conversations. Nowhere else do we nd extended dialogues between Christ and individual men and women : Nicodemus, the woman of Samariathe man bom blind, Mary Magdalene, Peter. In the rare cases in the other Gospels where Christ is speaking to an individual rather than 34to a group, the other seems little more than the occasion for Christ to say what could be said to everyone. But in John we nd encounters with strongly marked, distinctive characters: the meeting of the great \"I am\" of the Christ with the fully conscious \u2014 and therefore profoundly lonely and anxious \u2014 \"I am\" of man. In these conversations the personal needs and problems of the speaker lead to the moment when he can be called to do something relevant to the whole w o r l d - s i t u a t i o n . T h e S a m a r i t a n w o m a n f e t c h e s h e r f r i e n d s t o s e e t h e o n e w h o c o u l d r e a d h e r l i f e a n d h a s m a d e h i m s e l f k n o w n t o h e r as the Messiah. The man born blind can put up brave argument in the synagogue. Mary Magdalene goes to the disciples and bears a message from the Risen Christ. Release in action is given in each case\u2014 to the weary, or frustrated, or sorrowful self. Through St. John, the language of the New Testament comes tofull maturity ; through a man himself the greatest example of maturity in old age, where the essential has been rened from the inessential in the re of meditative memory. Only from this vantage-point can he describe in such a way his own past actions and relationships. How could any man call himself \"the disciple whom Jesus loved\" ? Only one who through reflection over a very long period, seeing himself from outside in the vision of the past that is inscribed in the world-memory, had come to know that this description was justiedand necessary. The word here used does not mean \"hold in particular affection\" (as does the word used by Peter in his answer to the Christ's \"Lovest thou me ?\"), but is the great word of selfless, creative love : agapo. John sees himself as one on whom the Christ's redeem ing love worked for a particular purpose \u2014 the purpose that comes to , fruition when he writes the Gospel. In general, John does not include anything that has already been described in the other Gospels. There is for example no Temptation in the wilderness, no Sermon on the Mount, no casting out of devils, no Transguration, no Agony in the garden of Gethsemane. But two omissions seem nevertheless particularly puzzling at rst sight. There is no discouree by the Christ about the future of the world, to a small group of disciples on the Mount of Olives, looking across to the Temple, as in the rst three Gospels. And there is no Institution ofthe Holy Sacrament at the Last Supper. John appears to have been one of the three or four disciples whowere present when the Christ spoke of the future, and called them to look with understanding at the Temple of which no stone would be left upon another. This discourse, with its terrible warnings about the future of men and nations, had lived on in John's soul through decades, through the time when the physical Jerusalem was destroyed, and the persecution foretold by Christ had begun on a great scale. And then during his own imprisonment the Christ had come to him once morein cosmic splendour, and led him to look through ages of time to come towards the new, heavenly Jerusalem. Thus for John the whole Apocalypse had taken the place of the prophetic discourse. 35From early times, the difference in style between the Revelation of St. John and the Fourth Gospel has been a puzzle. Dionysius of Alexandria, a pupil of Origen, writing about 250 A.D., was preparedto say that they could not have been written by the same man ; and most modem critics agree with him, speaking of the innumerable solecisms in the Apocalypse, and complete difference of vocabulary . But does this take sufciently into account that, with John, style was something far more conscious, and penetrated with spiritual p u r p o s e , t h a n w i t h o t h e r m e n ? H e w a s p r e p a r e d t o fl o u t t h e o r i n a r yrules of grammar if he could get nearer in this way to his Inspiration. It has been shown that what appear to be mistakes are often examples of intensely Hebraistic idiom. May not the differences in style between the Apocalypse and the Gospel have been shaped to some extent by the differences in spiritual activity involved \u2014 in looking forward, on the one hand, at coming ages, where the unfamiliar pictures could be brought ne^er to those who received them only by being clothed as far as possible in the language of the Old T estament prophets; and on the other hand in looking back at events in the recent past, events felt as eternally present ? Just because the world-storms of the Apocalypse had been described in a style that tted them, might not John have grown better able, years later, to describe the heavenly tranquillity of the Last Supper ?In the Gospel, ve chapters are given to the Last Supper : and inthese everything, from the Washing of the Feet to the High-Priestly Prayer, is unique to John. And yet it is puzzling that there is nothingabout the event which the other Gospels record as the heart of the Last Supper, the blessing and sharing of Bread and Wine as Bodv and Blood of Christ. When he wrote the Gospel, St. John bore in mind the development of the Church through some sixty or seventy eventful, decisive years ; and he saw in vision the dangers and the achievements of Christendom in ages to come. The form and process of the Sacrament had been part of the teaching of the Risen Christ. But, as has been said,this teaching could only to a very limited extent be conveyed in the Gospels. It is one of the paradoxes in the structure of the Gospelsthat they are continually leading towards the Resurrection; it is implied in everything, everjdhing prepares for it; and yet whenEaster comes, they can say very little. The Fourth Gospel itself, having long spoken in terms of Inspiration or even Intuition, of indwelling love, putting aside all parable \u2014 retreats, as it were', inthe last chapter into the language of Imagination, with the miraculous draught of shes by the lake of Galilee. In that the teaching of the Christ about the Sacrament after Eastercoifld not be directly recorded at that time, there was the danger , which later had far-reaching effects, that the Sacrament would be coimected only with the Last Supper, and seen simply as a memorialof it; and not as an expression, and effective continuance, of thewhole Deed of Christ. It is this misunderstanding that St. Johnsets himself to correct. The mysteries of Bread and Wine are inter woven, more explicitly than by the other Evangelists, with the whole Gospel. The rst of the seven Signs is the Marriage of Cana in G^ilee,where water is made wine. The central, fourth Sign is the feeding of the Five Thousand, the only miracle described by all four Gospels : the giving of bread and shes. And immediately after the fth Sign, Christ's walking on the sea, we are led into the realm of Inspiration, where the Christ describes his own being in seven Sayings, of which the rst is : \"I am the Bread of Life\". In connexion with this Saying that discourse develops, which strains to the uttermost the understand ing even of the disciples : 'Tf you do not eat the flesh of the SonMan and drink his blood, you have no Life in you\". The last of the seven Sayings, like the rst Sign, is concerned with the mystery of the blood : 'T am the true Vine, and my Father is the husbandman\". Thus intricately is the whole composition of the Gospel concerned with the Christ's giving of Himself through the substances of earth. And the composition shows, too, that there is a long and perilous journey of the soul between the unconscious receiving described atCana and the understanding to which the disciples are to awake; in which they are to feel themselves as branches of the Vine. Their task as servants of the Word must not be separated from the trans mission of Life. The thought of the modem world has tended everywhere to divide and analyse, and it has given the same treatment to the Gospels. But the Life that is in them triumphs continually over dismember ment, revealing its unity, and its true home in sacramental experience, among developing communities of Christians. Rudolf Steiner did not only make, as servant of this Life, a far-reaching contribution to the understanding of the Gospels. By making possible a renewal of spiritually illumined Sacraments, through his help to the founders of the movement that has dared to take in particular the name. Christian Community, he restored the stream in which our profaned modem languages need to be baptised, if they are to become right bearers ofthe etemal, living Gospel. 37MICHAEL, ST. GEORGE AND T H E H O L Y S O P H I A \u2014 I I Isabel Wyatt The rst part of this study, which appeared in last year's Golden Blade, unfolded the story of St. George from his martyrdom during the Tliocletian persecution, as recorded in fourth century Coptic manuscripts, to his adoption by Constantino as Champion of Christendom, and so to his ghting in the service of Michael's sun-forces against Mahomet's moon-forces from the eighth century to the fourteenth\u2014in Spain againstthe Moors, in Russia against the Mongol-Tartars, and against the S a r a c e n s i n t h e C r u s a d e s . F r o m t h e C m s a d e s o n w a r d s , S t . G e o r g e b e g i n s t o g r o w i n t o t h e spiritual leadership of England. Perhaps more than any other nation she needed those forces of St. George which could defend her true being from the forces of Mahomet. For England was to suffer in a quite special way a resuscitated reverberation of Haroun- el-Raschid's culture. She was to penetrate quite specially deeply the rigid realm of the intellect. St. George returned to England with England's soldiery ; and al though Coeur-de-Lion did not redeem the vow made outside the wallsof Acre, the same impulse came to birth in Edward III on the battle eld of Crecy. Before giving the signal for attack with Coeur-de- Lion's now famous battle-cry\u2014Upon them, St. Georgg\u2014Edward reminded his knights of the ''blew thonges\" bound by that king about his Crusaders' legs, and promised that if Crecy were won he would himself redeem Coeur-de-Lion's vow and re-found Arthur's Order, adopting St. George as its patron and the \"blew thonges\" as its badge. Cr6cy was won. Edward built the Round Tower at Windsor, enclosing the British Table-Mound which had been one of the \"stations''at which Arthur's Table Round was held (the Table-Mounds at Win chester, Camelot and Caerleon-on-Usk were others) ; and here, onSt. George's Day, 1350, the Most Honourable Order of the Knights of St. George and the Garter was instituted, \"in honour of God, Our Lady and St. George\", and the rst twenty-ve Knight Companions,in blue mantle, blue thong and collar of roses with pendant of St. George ghting the dragon, were solemnly consecrated. Side by side with this placing of the highest Order of Chivalry under the patronage of St. George, Edward continued to foster the saint's protection of the common soldiery. \"Edward III\", says Camden in his Britannia, \"gave to every one of his soldiers a white coat or cassock with a red cross on each side, so that it was a seemlyand magnicent thing to see the armies of the English ^parkk like the rising sunne, soldierie of other countries having no habit either to distinguish or adorn them\". So arose the George Jacque (forerunnerof the Union Jack), which Richard II, invading Scotland m 1388,made obligatory\u2014\"that every man, of what estate, condition or nationhe may be, so that he be of our party , bear a sign of the arms^of St G e o r g e b o t h b e f o r e a n d b e h i n d .

I fout the dragon bould, and broft un to the slaughter ; By that I gained fair Sabra, the King of Egypt's daughter. St. George has remained the great Martyr of the Greek Church, his life, his passion and his miracles still held in memory. But in England all that survived the bowdlerising of the Reformation wasthe dragon and the princess and the Turkish knight, and the fact that St. George was \"our English knight-0\". And so there grew up a whole new literature, springing direct from the English folk-soul itself, which signed and seded him English. One story in this stream, by virtue of the enchantment of its poetry, has lived to become an English classic. In The Faerie Queene Spenser gives expression to this new development by boldly annexingSt. George as native to the country of his adoption. Heavenly Contemplation, expounding to the young Red Cross Knight the secret of his lineage, tells him ; Thou spring'St from ancient race Of Saxon kings . . . From thence a fairy thee unwitting reft. And in a heaped furrow did thee hide. Where thee a ploughman all unwitting found. And brought thee up in ploughman's state to bide. Till, pricked with courage and thy force's pride. To Faery Court thou cam'st to seek for fame And prove thy puissant arms .... Now thou among those saints whom thou dost see Shalt be a saint and thine own nation's friend And patron : thou St. George shalt called be, St. George of merry England, the sign of victory. But it was The Most Famous Historic of the Seven Champions of Christendom, by another Elizabethan, Richard Johnstone, which found most favour with the folk themselves. This tells how, in the time of Uther Pendragon, the father of King Arthur, the new-born son of Lord Albert of Coventry is stolen by Kalyb the Enchantress, who gives him the name of George and brings him up in the forest; how he rescues six knights whom she has turned to stone, and with them journeys to the East, where he ghts against the Saracens and saves Sabra, the daughter of King Ptolemy of Egypt, from the dragon of the stagnant lake ; how Almidor, the dark Prince of Morocco, desiring Sabra, prevails upon her father to send George to the Kingof Persia, with a letter asking him to put the bearer to death as a Christian ; how George breaks out of his Persian prison, returns to Egypt, rescues Sabra from Smooth Almidor, brings by d\"\" Ibiko of I T-biiio on the occasion of the being niaile a Kniglit of her; how they have three knightly sons, Guy, Alexander and David ; and how they live happily together until, thrown while hunting, Sabra dies from the pricks of a thorny brake. This was the story which, in divers versions, was told at English resides for three centuries, and which even in our own survives as a nursery tale. From it sprang countless seventeenth century ballads, some of which Bishop Percy collected in his Reliques ; from it sprang also that eighteenth century Chapbook which ran into many editions. The Enghsh people had identied St. George as their patron saint by making him of their own blood and bone. * * But as true-born Englishman George still confronts the forces of Mahomet in Almidor, the dark prince of Morocco, and in the Turkish knight whonii he kills and brings to hfe again. And in his conquestof the dragon he still follows the same path of purication of man's animal nature. The very name of the city near which the dragon has its lair\u2014Silene\u2014holds a secret; for it means \"moon\". It was during the Moon-evolution of the earth that man received that astral body which already was worked over and brought a step forwardin that Egyptian period which preceded the Graeco-Latin ; and the present period, in which England has a leading part to play, is one inwhich many Egyptian impulses come into recapitulation. But they have a legitimate place in contemporary culture only if they have been permeated by the Christ-Impulse. So, in English mediaeval folk-lore, St. George kills the King of Egypt, whose astrality, good in its own age, would be evil becausedecadent if taken untransmuted into this ; but the King of Egypt's daughter, who is young, pure, beautiful and willing to beconie a Christian, he rescues from the peril of a union with the dark prince of Morocco, and brings her\u2014and with her the astral forces of Egypt in a cleansed and Christened form\u2014^to her new rightful home. The King of Egypt's daughter has three different names in these English stories\u2014Sabra, Elya, Cleodolinda. In Cleodolinda, whichmeans \"glory, height or manifestation of beauty\", we see, as in St. George's own beauty, the cleansed astrality portrayed. Elya (hername also in Scandinavia), which means \"oHve\", we can see in a twofold aspect\u2014as the peace-bringing olive-branch, indicative of the holy serenity into which George brings the turbulent forces of the soul; and as that power of living, brain-free thought which makesthe olive the emblem of the wise Pallas Athene. Sabra, speech, connected with both \"seven\" and \"Sabbath\", meant originally \"rest\" ; and so, along the same path as SchoUastike, came also to mean \"learning\". She is rescued from the scorpion sting of Almidor in the East, only to succumb to its Western metamorphosis in the pricks of the thorny brake. But before this happens she has givenbirth to three sons, who are trained to be true knights and also to be 41craftsmen, one in stone, one in wood, one in metals\u2014to work uponthe three earthly sheaths of the mineral physical body, the plant- related etheric body, and the astral, drawn (as its name reveals) from those starry realms whose gifts the metals are to the substance of the Earth. Because in this princess live the pure, innocent forces of the soul, her girdle tied about the neck of the dragon, when once St. George hcLS subdued it, has the power of turning it into \"a meek beast and debonair\". Therefore it is always stressed that she is a pure virgin. Thus, in one of the seventeenth century ballads, when \"two hungry lyons erce and fell\" appear and tear to pieces the lascivious eunuchin whose care St. George has left her, Down by the ladye then they layd, Whereby they shewed she was a maid. Even more complete is the transmutation of the animal nature into the chastity of love in those versions wherein St. George lays his cross- shaped sword upon the dragon's head, and so turns it into a lamb.The rejoicing populace ask how this transformation has been wrought, and St. George replies that only Christ is able to bring it about. Here in the clarity of supreme simplicity we see portrayed how the union of Christ with the cross of the three lower natures begins to work transmutingly upon them. That the dragon was seen as destroyingboth innocence and true manhood is indicated in its devouring daily one lamb and one man. In old paintings of St. George ght ing the dragon, a lamb frequently nestles beside the praying princess ;and in the guild processions and the Riding of the George, Sabra and her white lamb went together before him. It is signicant in this connection that in Russia St. George is known as the Guardian of the Flocks ; and it would seem that from the beginning the Eastern Church associated with him the white lamb of a puried astrality, for both at his church at Lydda and among the Persian Nestorians (who dedicated many churches to him) it was long customary tosacrice a white lamb on his feast day. How far can we think of England as having been, m the penod since she took the red cross as her emblem, concerned with this trans mutation of dragon into lamb ? Confronted with our own con temporary faults of national character, we are not perhaps sufcientlyaware of how the sphere in which these lie has chained since the English folk-soul rst became clearly conscious of St. George s hand invisibly but powerfully guiding her destiny. The replacing on the Enghsh throne of the volatile, outflowing Richard II by the sohd, s^-contained Henry IV at the end of the fourteenth century pregures and ushers in deep changes in the soul of the nation itself.All chroniclers of the fourteenth century agree in speaking of the restless temper, quickness to wrath, unpredictable unreliability of the English at that time ; and Chaucer apostrophises them in the same vein : 0 stormy people, unsad and untrue, Aye indiscreet, and changing as a vane ! From when, in 1416, the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund broughtSt. George's heart to England, and Henry V laid it up in the Chapel of St. George at Windsor built by Edward III for the Order of the Garter it is as if that heart begins to work hke a spiritual leaven within'the character of the nation, preparing it for its new task in the new age which had just dawned. That task was to be the elaborating of the Consciousness Soul. The new British phlegm, the new onlooker quahty of detachment, the new sense of isolated selfhood, the new respect for another's individual personality\u2014all these were to be aspects of that elaboration. And the Consciousness Soul itself is a necessary preliminary to the growth of Spirit-Self; it is into its vessel of sohtary self-awareness that the new orinciple waiting to be added to man's being can descend.S ^ r l o L t K p o c h ' s t a s k e n d m t h t h e s h a p i n g o f t h i s c h a l i c e .

Again, as in the wars against the Moors in Spain and the Saracensin Palestine, it is indicated that although the heroes have vanquished Islam, they nevertheless have suffered its scorpion prick ; for the bylina tells that the boasting which led to their bUndness arose fromtheir turning away from \"their guardian, the call of the heart, good, quiet and wise\", and instead \"trusting only to their reason\". The Russian folk-soul, like the English, makes St. George her own by claiming him to be of her own blood and lineage ; but to compareher expression of this claim with England's is to see deep into the differences of national spirituaUty. Beside England's hearty earthi- ness, there is a breath of the mystical, even of the cosmological, in Russia's shaping of her St. George's story. He is bom of a beautiful Slav princess. Queen Sophia the Wise ; and he has three sisters. Faith, Hope and Charity. Where the English folk-ballads recount of the Enghsh babe that A blood-red cross was on his arm. A dragon on his breast; A little garter all of gold Was round his leg expressed^ the legs of the princely Russian babe are silver up to the knee, his arms pure gold to the elbow, and his head is covered with pearls. Pasikrates' account of his young lord's martyrdom lives again in the Russian story of how St. George came to Jerusalem, which had just been captured by an evil king, who desired to put the saint todeath. He tried with swords and axes, but they refused to wound him ; he had him drowned, and he returned to hfe ; burned, and he returned to life ; pounded in a mortar, and again he returned to life. In a last attempt, the king immured him in a cofn and caused this to be buried deep in the ground. The Earth folded itself back, the cofn rose and burst asunder, and St. George came forth, while from the aura of the Earth there resounded a Resurrection Hymn. Again the red cross path is pictured with imaginative vision inthe story of how St. George set out on a long journey to bring to Russia tidings of the Risen Christ. First he came to a mountain so high that he could not chmb it; but at his bidding it lowered it self and spread itself abroad over the Earth. Then he came to a forest so dense that he could not penetrate it; but at his bidding the trees took up their roots and set themselves in fruitful groups about the land, ften he came to a multitude of ravening wild beasts ; but at his bidding they grew docile and opened their ranks that he might continue his journey.

Sophia. In perceiving St. George as the son of Queen Soplua theWise, she touches a deep secret, one which Pasikrates also indicatesin his name for St. George's mother\u2014Kira Theognosta, the Lady olthe Knowledge of God\u2014and out of whose last echoes Justinian, building his church where Constantine's in honour of St. George haa stood, dedicates it to San Sophia. Rudolf Steiner has called the moon the cosmos of wisdom, for itwas during the Moon-evolution of the Earth, which gave man his astral body, that the unconscious wisdom which we caU insect was built into the animal world. Man has been torn out of this, but when his astrality is redeemed into Spint-Self he will enter agam this harmonious sphere of wisdom, but on a higher, conscious level. Moreover, the knowledge of the headnenetrated bv the wisdom of the heart; man, who judges now out of the limitations of his sense-nature, inp h r a s e , t h e n c o g n i s e a s a n a n g e l .

When man began to tbink, no longer out of the revelation given from above, but out ofhimself, Sophia suffered a contraction, a diminution, into Philosophia. As man continued to draw the nature of thinking more and more down to earth and to bind it to his own brain, those forces of the Sophia which on the rst Christmas Eve had brought angelic tidings to the shepherds, dried up into sense perception of the mere surfaces of things; those forces of the Sophia by which a still sacred astrologyhad revealed to the Magi the approach of the Christ dried up into the facidties of mechanics and mathematics. In the sixth century after Christ came an increase of darkening, which continued with the growth of material thinking, until by the nineteenth the last rays of Sophia's light had been obliterated. Dr. Steiner tells the story of this descent from another aspect, also\u2014in terms of Michael's working. For Michael himself was born of the Heavenly Sophia\u2014as Marduk, his Babylonian reflection, was of the Heavenly E.a\u2014and for long cycles of time was the Regent of the Cosmic Intelligence, pouring it meetly into the evolution of the universe and of mankind. But little by little man sequestered it, until in the eighth and ninth centuries it fell from Michael's hands,to become completely human. Not for a thousand years, not till in 1879 that new Michael Age began in which Michael guides man not only as an archangel, as in former short sun-periods, but as Time- Spirit, leading the whole epoch, could this intelligence begin to pass again into his hands. * * * If we bring together these supersensible events with the course of outer history, we nd that the increased darkening of Sophia's light in the sixth century is coincident with the extinction of Gnosti cism, the rise of Mahomet, and the Arabianising of Aristotle. We nd that the eighth century, in which Haroun-el-Raschid spreads the Arabic culti^e in the East from Baghdad while the Moorish con querors spread it in the West from Cordova; and the ninth, in which,the rst doubts concerning the reality of the Transubstantiation appear, and in which Haroun works after death to bring about thatdenial of the spirit framed in the Council of Constantinople's decree that man consists of soul and body only\u2014we find that these are the centuries in which the regency of the Heavenly Intelligence falls awav from Michael. And now, with each further leap in the life of humanity away from the living knowledge of the supersensible towards rigid inteUectual concepts, SopWa's light grows feebler. The Moslem world-conception wMch, with the wide-spread influence of Avicennain the realm of medicine and of A Vterroes in the realm of philosophy continues in decadence to flourish in Europe right into the seven teenth century , receives in that century a fresh impetus and directionvdth the return to earthly life of Haroun-el-Raschid in the personalityof Francis Bacon, whose Novum Organum launches a new natural 46science conned within the realm of the purely sense-perceptible. So the ancient spiritual wisdom of Sophia goes gradually down into total darkness. The Schoolmen's imaging of Averroes in the form of a devil being trampled underfoot by the ^'AngeUc Doctor\", Aqmnas\u2014ChristianisedAristotelianism triumphing over Arabianised\u2014finds a certam echo in some of the Northern representations of St. George dunng this period. Thus, in the fteenth century group in Stockholm by BemtNotke and Hindrich Wylsynck, the dragon, a gigantic loathly larva is armed with long, sharply pointed sea-urchin spines, and its fanged jaws are most ttingly closing on the head of the cluld St. George shorse (the symbol of earthly intelligence) ; and in Diirer's engraving the eye is caught immediately by the curious lobster case and claws of the dead dragon stretched beneath the sturdy, soldierly St. George on his lusty courser . The same symbol speaks in the fish shells\u2014empty, dried up, brittle, devoid of nourishment\u2014with which, in Hansel and, Grethel, the witch, the hardened sense-nature, feeds the tender soul newly come to earth. And it would seem that the common folk of England sensed a need to be protected from these craysh forces in book-learning; for, like the George Jacque which guarded the soldier both before and behind, the hornbook alphabet- known in the dialect as the Crissycross (Christ-cross) Book\u2014bore onits front the Red Cross of the Christ, and on its back St. Geor^ sub- duing the dragon\u2014the holy powers of L ydda against Silene,the holier powers of Golgotha against Gondishapur. , - i,- So the forces of the Crescent in modern natural saence Imd Sophiain her cofn until, with the dawn of the new Sun-Age, Michael could unite once more with the forces of man's intelligence. For man has to nd and follow the way back from dead to hying tlnnking, re- quickening the mathematical-mechanistic faculties into pictonal Imaginations, the sense-perceptions into Inspiration, men m thisway he has carried a stage higher all that he has learned m the purelysensible, the purely physical, the lost Sophia can be found againB u t s h e i s n o l o ^ e r t h e D i v i n e S o p h i a ; t h e i n t e l l i g e n c e w i t h w ^ c hMichael again unites has passed through the realin of man Whathas come to development with the preparation of Spirit-Self , saysRudolf Steiner , \"is the presence of a new Sophia-Anthroposoplua,the Sophia who, after passing through the human sou through the being of man, henceforth bears within her that being .

For the Soviet regime is based on an abstract ideology, and strives out of the realm of \"reason\" to bring to birth by force a robot and regimented monkey-reflection (to use Dostoi evsky's transparent phrase) of that community of brotherly love which will in the far-off future unfold livingly, like a flower, out of the quiet, wise \"call of the heart\". B u t t o t h e a t t e n t i v e e a r t h e r e c o m e f r o m t i m e t o t i m e m u r m u r e d intimations from the Russian folk-soul that St. George still ghts in her defence against these scorpion forces. Such an intimation nds expression in the modern bylina, How the Mountains let out of their Deep Caves the Mighty Heroes of Russia.! One evening in 1925, an oldRussian peasant reciter\u2014over eighty years of age\u2014^having just recited the traditional closing legend, looked beyond her listeners into spaces where its spiritual sequel unfolded in powerful pictures, out of which she spontaneously created this new heroic lay. It tells how' one-eyed Falsehood, with muzzle of hound instead of face and hanging tonguea verst long, stalks Russia, devouring her people, and how the heroes, waking from their sleep, pray to be released from their prison-cavesto ght her. But when they stand face to face with her and her black army, they nd that an invisible guardian makes her invulner able. St. George the Valiant comes to their aid, \"young, vigorous, ineffably beautiful\", and with him the Archangel Michael. George is swinging his sword to cut down Falsehood when \"his silver-clad legs trembled, his gold-clad arms went numb\", for it seems to him that it is Christ who stands beside her. But when Michael with his sword of re steps forward, George sees the gure beside Falsehood begin to become \"wild, loathsome, cunning, foul as some unclean creature of the marsh\". He knows it then for Antichrist. Antichrist turns into a terrible black raven, two thousand versts from wing to wing, its eyes a ery hell, its bill and claws of iron : That black raven holds in its grip the holy land of Russia. With its iron beak it pecks it and drinks its hot blood. Holy Russia groans. The black raven rejoices. Now Michael, by Christ's command, joins battle with the raven : Antichrist the raven spread his black wings. He rose all enormous, dark with eyes of re. With his darkness he covered the bright sun, He darkened the clear sky. On the Archangel like a stone he fell. With his black wings overwhelmed him. Cold went the heart of the heroes. \"Tell us, tell us, St. George, tell us the truth. Can it be ?\" Smiling, St. George the Valiant shook his pearly head.

We see him as King Arthur's ideal, as the prototype of such knights as won the Grail;for the Grail King also was that knight who, riding ahead of human evolution, had already inwardly transmuted his threefold human nature. His name becomes transparent for a tiller of the Earth, not as Spenser's literal ploughman, but as one who transubstantiates the Earth with his own transubstantiation. We understand why the Coptic tradition makes St. George the only martyr to be carried to heaven not by an archangel but by Christ Himself; for George, through his deaths and resurrections, has unfolded the fulness of hisnature in a protracted sacrament, and has become the great earthly pattern for that completed picture of perfected man as true human image of the threefold Godhead whose heavenly archetype the discipleswere permitted to behold on the Mount of Transguration. As we contemplate St. George's spiritual deeds, his championing of all that lies on the rightful Michael-path of evolution, his battling against all that constitutes an impediment on that path, and the consequent threefold birth in him of that Higher Man who is destined to be victorious over all lower human elements, he increases in stature and sublimity until the majestic vision of him seen by Abba Theodotus flowers again in us : \"And I saw one coming forth from within the veil like unto a king wearing a diadem of gold with seven crowns upon it, and he was riding upon a white horse, and he was many times brighter than the sxm, and was equipped with sword and armour and the apparel of a king : in short, his kingly dignity was immeasurable\".L A M E N T F O R T H E M A K E R S Where are the Hampshiremen toiled at the tillage hundreds of years till this green county grew splendid in spilth ? ... all gone, village on village, under the yew: in lost grey churchyards old, they, now, beneath the mould, since Time their tale hath told, lie in the lew. Where are the shepherds who by their strawed hurdles nightlong, knelt, lanterned, by some gasping ewe : silent men, tallies stuck in their smock-girdles ? .... under the yew, they, though far-hied their sheep, heed not now where these creep ; for they, at last, asleep, lie in the lew. Where they who baulked the clays down to the dingles ? High on stamped headlands the long ploughs would slew : deep breathed the tired teams, and slow slapped the swingles: \u2014^under the yew, under the brooding bough no more they know the plough ; they, lapped in quiet now, lie in the lew. They, where the great glebes their undulate acresheave like swept seas where the wind is a mew, rolled home their harvest-loads down the long breakers. Under the yew, now, wild though winds may blow, they neither care nor know, they, who by Time laid low, lie in the lew. They oft were down in the meads with scythes swingingwhen day rst slashed diamond-edged on the dew; they set the steel with their hones roundly ringing ; .... under the yew, t o t h e m n o m o r e i s k n o w n sighing on steel of stone ; they, under grass unmown, lie in the lew. 50 51They were the stuff on which gods build their glory ; they, true as stars in their courses, were true.Time that ends all things, has ended their story under the yew.

Brading. H, E. Brading died last August. While on active service as an ofcer in the Royal Artillery, during the last war, he was blown up bya land-mine, and for several years up to his death he endured a crippling illness with great patience and fortitude. In^ his youth he had worked on the land, and his feeling for the Hampshire countryside was a frequent source of his poetry. Much of it was written within a quite short period, during a holiday in Austria directly after he left the Army\\ he recognised that in some respects his later outlook was not fully reflected in it. He was rst led to an interest in Anthroposophy through its bearing on agriculture, and he became a member of the General Anthroposophical Society. His poetry has appeared in every issue of 'The Golden Blade*:a friend, as well as a valued contributor, has left this life.\u2014C. W.T H E A R T O F E U R H Y T H M Y Owen Bareld T h e n e w a r t o f E u r h y t h m y , w h i c h R u d o l f S t e i n e r i n a u g u r a t e dabout forty years ago, was, in his own view, one of the most important contributions made by Anthroposophy to thecivilization of our time. For an anthroposophist well instructed in the history of consciousness, it is fairly easy to show in theory why this should be so. But since Eurhythmy is not itself a theory but a practice, I prefer to begin this article not with an historical approach,but with the present moment in which that practice is being carried on. The rst question then, is not, how and why did Eurhythmy come into being, but what sort of things go on in the minds of the audience when a public performance is given ? Human beings must perforce proceed from the known to the unknown. Confronted with something new, they instinctively compare it with the nearest\u2014or what seems to them the nearest\u2014 thing to it in their store of experience. In 1954 the spectator of a Eurhythmy performance\u2014and I am purposely assuming that it ishis rst venture and that the literature of Anthroposophy is a sealed book to him\u2014will inevitably begin by comparing it with baUet. We need not linger on the resemblances, but as time goes on, he is likely to note the following surface differences. That the movementson the stage are accompanied about as often by the spoken word (usually poetry) as they are by music; that much less importance appears to'^be attached to legs and their movements than is the casein ballet-dancing ; that the arm movements, on the other hand, are much more varied and subtle. There are, of comse, other differences ; but Jet us assume that our spectator begins\u2014as he is likely to do\u2014 by noticing these three. What can be done next by way of tryingto appreciate the different and the new? I think it possible that, if he relates the rst difference with the third, and particularly if he has noticed a peculiar shape-making quality in some of the arm movements, he may come to the pointof saying to himself: 'Tt seems to be a sort of attempt to talk with the whole body, especially the arms\". And he will probably add, in a bewildered sort of way: \"But in that case, why do they do it t o m u s i c a s w e l l ? \" At all events, if he does get to the point of saying this to himself, he will be doing pretty weU; ynll perhaps have advanced about as far on the road to understanding Eurh5d:hmy as desultory specula tion will take him. How far appreciation, and its concoiiiitant delight, must depend on understanding, is a question it is better to defer. The point is that, for anyone who started, as ft were, from scratch and wauted eventuaUy to reach an understanding of the true nature 5253of Eurh5rthmy, this notion of \"talking with the body\" would be a good rst step. It was so that Rudolf Steiner himself developed and presented it. It is true that he once referred to it as \"a metamorphosisof dancing\", or as a sort of attempt to restore \"temple-dancing\" ; which was itself, he said, an attempt to reflect the movements of the stars and planets, whose creative forces streamed into and fashioned man ; and there is no need, in order to enjoy Eurhsdhmy, to belittle the art of dancing and its possibilities. But Steiner also pointed out that Eurhsdhmy is not dancing but 'visible speech' and 'visible song'. Moreover, when Eurh5dhmy was bom, dancing in the form of ballet was still a comparatively rare and exotic plant. Now that it has become so familiar and ubiquitous, it is the distinction rather than the relation between the two, which requires emphasising. Since, however, it is an ignorant (though open-minded) spectator whose self-education in the understanding of Eiuhythmy we are imagining, let us for the moment leave Steiner's own exposition outof it. Let us suppose that, having reached this vague but pleasing fancy of \"talking with the body\", he decided to investigate it furtherand see where it led him. Presumably he would rst ask himself what, in some deeper sense, happens when we 'talk', and he would begin to examine theories about language and the origin of language and the nature of utterance and the word. Unfortunately, nearly all that has been written on this subject, especially when it attemps to deal with the sounds as well as with the meanings of words, is either pedantic or shallow or both. It is justa fact that the Darwinian theory is totally incompatible with an rmderstanding of the tme nature of human speech. And it was inthe nineteenth century, when the Darwinian theory held almost undisputed sway, that the devising of theories on the origin of languagebecame a sort of popular sport. The specxilative nature of these theories\u2014variously nicknamed the \"Bow-wow\", the \"Pooh-p6oh\",the \"Ding-Dong\" theory and the like\u2014was quickly apparent to all and, well before the turn of the century, the subject of the origin of language had by a sort of tacit consent been ruled out of the provienceof scholarship and relegated to the mystics. Since that time occasional attempts have been made to base, if not the origin, at all events thenature of knguage on some kind of \"sound symbolism\", and to relate the semantic element in words to the movements of the organs which produce them, and of the muscles generally . These attempts, how ever, have attracted very little attention, and it was only by accidentthat I heard of a book, published as recently as 1935, which might help a Mttle further on his path our imagined spectator ; who, by the way, has now, I think, served his purpose and may be allowed to retire. Sir Richard Paget's This English begins with an attempt toconsider the whole nature of human speech and its relation to gestureH e b a s e s h i s a p p r o a c h o n a c e r t a i n o b s e r v e d p a r a l l e l i s m \u2014 a n d s y mpathy\u2014between the movements of the limbs, particul^ly the armsand hands, and the movements of the vocal organs. This parallelism was indeed pointed out by Darwin himself in his book The Expression of the Emotions. Sir Richard Paget then goes on to mention that the gestures of articulation\u2014or, as he elsewhere calls them, mouth- gestures\" and \"mouth-postures\"\u2014which are made by the vocalorgans in uttering the series of sounds which go to make up a partic^lar word, repeat on a small scale the sort of bodily gestures man would make\u2014and once did make\u2014when he was trying to convey the same meaning by gesticulation :\u2014 \"Thus, as man developed a gesture language with his hands and body\u2014namely , by making natural pantomime\u2014he also uncon sciously , developed a more or less corresponding gesture languageof jaw, lips, tongue, etc., that accompanied it\". T o give only one example, this author describes the mouth-gesture which produces the vowel u (oo) as \"an elongated tubular moutn, nearly closed at either end\", and suggests that it may be expected tomean \"something enclosed, or hollow , or full or tubular . . . something projecting forward\". The eurhythmist expresses the sound u bystretching out both arms to their full length, keeping them close together and parallel. I am not, however , advocating this book as the best introduction to the study of Eurhythmy. It is obvious from my quotations thatit will not take us very far. What is interesting about it, with ^1its crudity and limitations, is that by approaching the subject with a warmth of enthusiasm but in a strictly empirical way, and wth no preconceived view of the spiritual onpn of man, .or ja _ the author assumes the Darwinian hypothesis) with- t^reconcMyedview which is inimical to the whole trend of nonclusi^^he does, nevertheless, arrive at a conception of speech as being onginally and essentially\u2014gesture.

Since the Reformation, the mental picture which men have enter tained of creation has become increasingly one of a single act ofmanufacture by God the Father But, accortog to St. John, the world \"came into being through the Word . The Greek word whichhas been translated \"was made\" is the ordinary one for \"becoming\" or being born, while the Hebrew word used in the opening verses of the Book of Genesis has the meaning of cutting or carving as well as that of creating. It is clear that a \"Word\" which produced not only the audible but also the visible or tangibleworld which we see around us, must have been gestural as well as phonetic. \"What then would the gods do\", said Steiner in the rst of his lectures on Eurhythmy as Visible Speech, \"if they really wished to form man out of a lump of earth ? The gods would make movements, and as a result of these movements, capable of giving form to the dust of the earth, the human form would eventually arise\". The human being, he continued, as he standsbefore us, is the product of the eurhythmic movements which corres pond to the sounds of the alphabet. And he adds the rather startlingsentence :\u2014\"God eurhythmizes, and as the result of His eurhythmy there arises the form of man\". Perhaps the rst rule for understanding and appreciating Eurhythmy is never to lose sight ots cosmic origin, never to forget that, even in its lightest moments, it is trying to. \"restore primordial movement\" and in so doing to make us aware of the relation between speech and the genesis of man, and therefore between cosmic being and human being. This process of 'cosmic Eurhythmy' is moreover reflected in the archetypal forms of the Zodiac which stand about the Earth and the planets which move around it in their endlessly varied creative dance.Each sign of the Zodiac and each planet is shown by Rudolf Steiner to correspond with a particular sound of the human alphabet. And here we notice a signicant difference between the cosmic 'Word', out of which man originated, and the human speech and human Eurhythmy which he himself originates in response. The movementsin Eurhythmy which directly represent in this way the signs of the Zodiac and the planets are not the same as the movements for the sounds which 'correspond' to these signs and planets. Indeed, there is a certain contrast or opposition between the two series of movements. Paget spoke of 'consonant gestures* and 'vowel postures*, and this arrangement holds good for what one might call the 'alphabet movements' given for Eurhythmy. Whereas for the 'zodiacal and planetary movements' as such, though the Zodiac corresponds with consonants, and the planets with vowels, it is the Zodiac which is represented by postures and the vowels by gestures. Thus the soimd h may be associated either with the 'b' gesture or with the Virgo posture; the sound o either with the 'o' posture or the Jupiter gesture. It is as though in the one case the eurhythmist were called on to restore the primordial movement bya sort of recollection in imitation, while in the other he is to do so by means of his own, directionally opposite, response. One might expect\u2014^there were times when Rudolf Steiner himself seemed to expect\u2014that the fact just indicated, namely, that the movenaents of Eurythmy are based, at all events in intention, on thegestures and movements which underlie their own being, would beenough to ensure an instinctive and enthusiastic response froni anyaudience. Experience, however , has shown that this is far from being the case. And if we investigate the difculties in the way of such aninstinctive response a little further, I do not think shall nd i so very surprising. There are, rst, the difculties of the audience an ,secondly , the difculties of the eurhythmist. In order to understandand sympathise with both of them, it is necessary to consider tor a little what has happened to language, and man's relation to it, since the time of its origin. We live in an age in which it is customary to distingmsh sharp y between factual statements on the one hand, and poetic or t^^ncim statements on the other. It is a very necessary distinction ; ana tne power to make it is one of the faculties which all sane adults must acquire in some degree as they grow up. At the same time a s nc analysis of language\u2014that is of the medium through which ait sta -ments are made\u2014discloses that the number and nature of factual statements is so very limited as to exclude from \" matter almost everything that immediately concerns the ^ as such\u2014and a great deal else as well. We find, when we inves the nature of language, that, if by 'factual' statements wemeans - ments from which all that can only be called the poetic elem _ language has been eliminated, there is very little we can do wi\u2014beyond making machines and recording and operatingmechanical in nature. From one point of viewi-itatura^ y, _ very much indeed. Si monumentum reqmrts, i ^f^Hv theless, we shaU nd, if we add to logical analysisof words and their meanings, that meaning itself, i\"^^ in^aneuage. meaning, is the offspring, not of the logic but of the poe gu g - Furthermore, if we approach the Mstorical studywith no preconceived notions borrowed is not we are forced to the conclusion that the poetic necessarily man-made.

But, of course, for the same reason it becomes more difcult to practise. For the gradual disappearance of the poetic\u2014that is, of the inherent or \"given\" poetic\u2014from words is both cause and effect of another, parallel process. This is the divergence between the sounds of words and their meanings. Just as in the course of the ages sound, as carrier of meaning, became separated off from gesture, so, as the ensuing stage of the same process, meaning itself began to be felt as something separate from the sound which expressed it. It is much easier in a language such as Greek\u2014and still more Hebrew\u2014 to feel an inevitable and often wonderful unity between the sounds of certain words and their meanings than it is in any modem European language ; for the complex processes of physical migration, phonetic sound-changes, transliteration and translation have brought it about that, for instance, the same Greek or Latin word has often to be expressed in different modern languages by totally different sounds. People sometimes speak as if this were wholly deplorable. Itshould not be forgotten that most of the beautiful variety of the human landscape has grown from it. Nevertheless it is a tragic consequence of the process that in our own time we take, instinctively,a view of words which regards them, not as the carriers or garments of their meaning, but as tickets or labels which merely \"refer to\" the things or ideas they are said to \"mean\". We distinguish cautiously between the emotive and associational effect of a word and its \"reference\". I doubt whether this would have been possible even as recently as the 14th century. I doubt whether it would have been possible for St. Thomas Aquinas. The poets, of course, continue to be aware that the sounds are carriers of, as well as referents to, their meaning ; but even here the divergence between sound and meaning has gone very far. Dr. Johnson, a ne critic and himself the maker of two or three admirable poems, ridiculed the idea of any valid connection. Things have now gone so far that it is possible to write a book about the language of poetry , deliberately ignoring the sound-element and treating poetry simply as a system of meanings. Indeed, it is only about twenty-ve years since I wrote such a book myself. One begins then to appreciate the difculties of a modern audience confronted with a performance of Eurhythmy. We are asked to make the transition from sound back to gesture. But we are not even at the starting-point for such a transition. We are simply not used to experiencing words as sound ; we are used to regard themcLS labels\u2014^labels of some character no doubt\u2014melodious, jagged, and the like\u2014but still as labels. And incidentally, when poetry isin question, we are much more used to reading it in silence than to hearing it clothed in physical sound. It looks as if we shall needa very inspired and perfect performance indeed, if we are to be lifted out of ourselves. Yet the difculties in the way of the eurhythmist's producing such a perfect performance are even greater. For he\u2014or more probably she \u2014has to do the \"restoring\" not only with the mind but with thewhole body , and so that it is apparent in the subtle quality of least movements. Moreover, what precisely does it signify, this restoring of primordial speech-gestures ?\" Some kind of archaeological r^earch perhaps\u2014or a careful conning of descriptions given by Sternerfollowed by accurate reproduction\u2014as the smart recruit reproduces the instructions of the drill-sergeant ? Very far from it It is not simply gestures that are to be made; it is gestmes with meaningincarnate in them, gestures that are semantic in the \\^y that words are. And this means that the gestures will not reaUy be there at aUand there will be nothing for the audience to see\u2014or rather there wiUbe not hing it c an \" r ead\" , f or a t r ue s pec t at ion of E ur hy t hm y inv olv esnot only leeing, but also the kind of seeing through w^ch we c^ reading-there ;nU be nothing the audience can read , unless theperformer not only reproduces the gestures, but ako expenencesthem. In other words they must be, not reproduced, hui producedeach time out of the very self of the performer-a self which is as we know , a somewhat forlorn proposition; which has emerged fromthe cradling spirit; which has fallen out of the word which isaccustomed to divide meaning not only from gesture, but from sound itself. Man is however not yet entirely disinherited. The po^tillh a s h i s w o ^ d s m a n y o f t h e m w i t h o v e r t o n e s o f m e a n i n g t h a t W o t tfrom ancient roots far back in the past.

I do not say this for vague and general uplift. The deeper one enquires into the detail and practical appHcation, the more clearly it appears. Something of the sort is,of course, in a measure true of all the arts, and will become truer, but in the old-established arts there is a rich inheritance from traditipn which can be lived upon as a sort of spiritual capital, and this helps at present to conceal the fact. Eurhythmy is by the date of its birth, a Christian art, and in that sense it is the only one. * * * In practice, musical Eurhythmy meets with a readier response from the pubhc than speech Eurhythmy. This was a disappointment to Rudolf Steiner, who regarded it as showing a lack of real under standing of what Eurhythmy is. I think it is due also to the absence, where music is concerned, of the particular obstacle I have been stressing. In music there is no obvious duahty between thje sound in itself and a \"meaning\" conceived as separate from it. Whereas in speech Eurhythmy the overcoming in some measure of this dichotomy is a condition precedent to its appreciation. And this is something which the eurhythmists cannot do for themselves. They should be able to begin about where it leaves off. It is for the poet to re-unite meaning and sound, and for the reader or reciter to restore to sound some of its \"gestural\" quality. These are problems into which I cannot enter. It may be that the future of the art of Eurhy thmy depends on their solution. It is certain, however, that, if we wish to understand and appreciate Eurhythmy, we ought not to approach speech through music, but vice versa. This is also in accordance with the course of evolution, for there is little doubt that primordial language was richly varied in tone and pitch, that song came before instrumental music, and that instrumental music is really a comparatively recent separating off, or abstraction, of what was once only an element in the totality of utterance. In the rst two lectures in the book. Eurhythmy as Visible Song, the broad lines of such an approach are laid down. The alphabet and the diatonic scale are not just a heterogeneous aggregation of unorganised units. We can, if we will, get principal bearings and begin to nd our way about in their interrelations, aswe can, if we will, begin to nd our way about the starlit sky by learning to recognize, rst a few, and then more and more, of its wheeling constellations. In speech we distinguish rst and foremost between the vowels and the consonants, the vowels expressing the inwardness, the feelings of man, while the consonants seek to represent, by gesturaUy reproducing them, the forms which create and upholdthe outer world. But music as a whole is to speech as a whole rather as the vowels of speech are to its consonants. For while it is the function of speech to bring man into relation with the outer world, music is there to relate him to himself. 60T a^ng the vowels themselves, it is not so very difcult to acquirea feeling for the very great qualitative differences between them, if we allow ourselves to dwell on them inwardly. Bring yourself to meditate a little on a (English sound ah) and u, letting them well and truly resound and sing in the place where unheard melodies 'pipe tothe spirit ditties of no tone', and you will come to feel how, in an almost literal sense, they differ from each other toto caelo. , A large part of the two lectures to which I have referred was concerned withthe contrast between the \"forward\" vowels a and u on the one hand, and the \"back\" vowels a and e {eh) on the other; and with the fact that this polarity\u2014not of the vowels themselves, but of the experience of them\u2014^is found again in music, in the experience of major and minor. I can really do no more than indicate, for the benet of those who may be minded to read them, the sort of thing that is to be found in these two books. Eurhythmy as Visible Speech aad Eurhythmy as Visible Song. It is characteristic that some of Steiner'smost precious observations on the subject of sPeech are to be found in the latter. ^ The combination of extreme neness with unfathomable depthof much of the thought in these books is simply overwhelming. Ona hasty reading supercial contradictions will appear by reason of that very neness. For instance, the sound o expresses essentially an outgoing of the human being from himself, even of his astralfrom his physical\u2014and yet the gesture, like the shape of the letter ,IS an enclosing one. Or , again. Dr . Steiner remarks that the uttering of a imphes the plunging of the astral right down into the physical and vnth that a sense of well-being. {Wohlbenden). Yet two pages later we are told that a (and the minor in music) imphes themood or experience of sickness {Kranksein). There is a key to these apparent contradictions, and it is precisely that delicate reciprocityof ^ving and receiving to which I have already referred. We shall m^e ^otWng of these books, or of Eurhythmy , unless we keep rmhold of this key . But if we do keep hold of it, we nd it openingthe door of eternity . It is what I had in mind when I emphasized, earlier in this article, the close relation between the art of Eurhythmy and the Christ impulse. But this very relation makes it all the more necessary not to confuse aesthetic judgments with moral jud^ents. If we do fall mto that enror, we shall nd that in one respect art is very unchristian, r or Chnstianity looks to the intention rather than the deed, whereas the artistic merit of a work of art lies not in intention but in achieve ment. The point is, not, has it done the artist a lot of good, but,md it come off} Not, what was he aiming at, but, did he hit it ? Ihere is no substitute, in fact, for artistry. Nothing of all that has been said here proves that Eurhythmy is suitable for presenta tion to an audience by performance on the stage. That can only be proved by presenting it, and presenting it with artistry . 61If, however, the critical complain on principle that there must be a lack of variety in the movements they see ; if they suggest that the whole mode of expression is unfree, because it accepts certain estabhshed correspondences between sound and gesture ; or again, if they say that Eurhythmy is unnecessary, because the poem or the sonata was written to stand by itself and is sufcient (why therefore add Eurhythmy?), then they invite replies. The sounded consonants and vowels in a single English pentameter may be something like fty, but there will not be time to present more than 2 or 3 of them eurhythmically. This seems to me to allow, plenty of room for artistry in selection and combination ; and as to freedom, the material in which an artist works, the notes of the scale, the metre of verse, or the qualities of marble and pigment, are as much his opportunities as they are his limitations ; indeed they are oppor tunities because they are limitations. The other objection\u2014that Eurhythmy is an unnecessary, because merely ancillary, form of expression\u2014appears to me to be based on a misconception of itsnature. Eurhythmy should not be thought of as re-expressing what the music or words are expressing in another way. The music or the poem should rather be regarded as its subject-matter, which it then uses, as the poet or painter uses nature or man directly , and out of which it fashions a fresh work of art altogether. It is a creative art at one remove, not an executive art. Here it is borne in upon me that the actual performance on the stage is not in truth, as I said it would be, the point from which I started, but the point at which I have at last succeeded in arriving ;that I have written much more about language than about Eurhythmy and that I have really only succeededed in the stage for most of the things I wanted to say. Perhaps it was necessary, and, for the rest, perhaps there will be another opportunity, or somebody else wiU say them better. Note : It is a pleasure to acknowledge the heavy debt which this article owes to Miss Marguerite Lundgren, of the London School of Eurhjrthmy. I remain the sole author of its deficiencies.\u2014O. B. 62W H AT I S T H E M E A N I N G O F T H E E . E . G . ? Karl Konig, M.D. (Vienna). **The Living Brainby Grey Walter, (Duckworth 15/-) A R E V I E W o f t h i s b o o k i n T h e O b s e r v e r , l a s t J u n e , o p e n e d w i t hthe following words : 'This is a fascinating book, but a difcult one to review, for the ground it covers is wide and varied and often new, deriving largely from the researches of Dr. Grey Walter and his colleagues at the Burden Neurological Institute, Bristol, during the last ten years. They have been working with the electro encephalograph, recording and studying the rhythms of electrical activity which sweep through the 10,000 million cells of the human brain\". Though it is a brilliantly written book, full of intelligent sparksand witty remarks, it is so fuU of wrong statements and haphazard thinking that it is difcult for a reviewer to do justice to the positive qualities of The Living Brain, Dr. Grey Walter writes in his foreword: \"This book will be found a gentle book. There is no immodest exposure, no baring of the soul .... thus it is also a pious book if measured by standards of habitual reverence for the known as weU as the unknown in face of successive revelations\". I must confess that I found this book one of the most overbearing products of the modern mind ; lled with sweeping statements without adequate foundations ; a book written with a pugnacious accent and mental pride. The very rst chapter, \"Lords of the Earth\", is a big piece of nonsense. From the start. Dr. Walter seems incapable of distin guishing between brain and mind, and although he hits, at the beginning, on some truth, when speaking of the \"deep physiologicaldivision between man and ape\" (page 2), he soon begins to wade through very shallow and muddy waters. He describes the evolutionof plants and animals in a way which I can only compare to the manner of a television announcer demonstrating the \"secrets of evolution\". For example, \"What happened so scandalously was that, with a miUenial shudder of awakening not unlike our minor post-war rhapsody of a generation ago, the plant world discovered sex. The vegetable kingdom, hitherto blossomless, was swept by a deliriumof public lovemaking into the fantastic exhibitionism of the flowers\", (p. 6). These are the \"scientic\" modesties which Dr. Grey Waltercalls pious. He passes quickly from the vegetable kingdom to the animal world, and proceeds : \"Then comes the moment\u2014or the hidden process of many million years\u2014^in which the inherent mobffity ofanimal cell and organism exploits the next evolutionary jump\". This miraculous jump leads to the elaboration of sensitivity. I shall again quote the writer's own words: \"We have to visualise ail 63elementary system of control by which the forward part of an organismcan obtain information and feed it back internally for guidance of its operative motor nerve centres Feedback as the rst act of creation,or as the process of continuous creation, is a pretty subject for the metaphysician\", (p. 9). Evolution continues further, and in Dr. Walter's view it looks as follows : \"Some distant cousin of jellysh or starsh, spawned with a deformity of its nerve-net, steered its way a little more safely through the crowded primordial sea. The abnormally congestedforward units of the nerve-nets provided a dominant group of food- and-danger predictors, overpowering with their local majority the unorganised influence of the remaining few nerve-laments. So, proting by the accident of its congenital deformity, the worm-to-besurvived a little longer than its normal fellows and begat a race ofcreatures inheriting the tangled knots of nerve in head and belly\", (pp. 9/10). Now we know where we come from; a cell grew into a nervecell in order to become an electrical conductor; feedback intervenedas a miracle of creation, and an accidental congenital deformity gavense to the further evolution of animals. So far , I think, these examples are enough to show the fundamental thought-qualities of this part of the book. Dr. Walters continues in this rst chapter with further feedback-statements of similar quality, until at the end the humanbrain appears as a tremendous computing machine which is worth while investigating. 2. If the rst chapter is mainly an attempt to cover the prevailing Ignorance on the true facts of evolution, the second chapter, \"AMirror for the Brain\", contains some fundamental mistakes'. It deals with the development of electro-physiology and its last attain ment : The electro-encephalogram (E.E.G.). Dr . W^ter mentions the foolish Greeks, who did not even have aword for brain, and then starts to ponder : \"Was there, among the mystenes behind the altar, concealed perhaps in the Minerva mvtha suspicion of something more in the head than a thing, and that the organ which had to do the knowing of itself must be an organ ofreflection ? (p. 21). He quotes Shakespeare, Descartes and Hobbesuntil he reaches the statement of Dr . David Hartley , who in 1749 suggested that \"mental phenomena are derived from rhythmic movements in the brain\u2014vibrations, he called them\", (p. 22). And here DrWalter sees the rst dawn of his present belief. A belief which is nothing but the superstition that mental phenomena have theirsource in the electric energy of nerve ceUs. Why this superstition IS made and held throughout the book as a kind of dogma is un-under- standable. Continuously , brain and mind, electric energy and mental activity, are mixed up or interpolated for one another.The question of how electric energy arises in animal tissue is not answered: There is still controversy about the origin and nature 64of animal electricity . . . there is no evidence that the electric energy in nerve cells is generated by electro-magnetic induction or by the accumulation of a static charge\", (p. 24). Dr. Walter then tells, in his fascinating way, of the rst discovery of the E.E.G. by Berger in 1928, and the gradual acceptance of his experiments, with their further development, in this country especially, and in America. Dr. Walter compares the brain with Cinderella, because \"workers in the English laboratories had not permitted themselves to explore further than the top of the spinal cord. One took an anatomical glance at the brain, and turned away in despair\", (p. 27). This is a very subjective statement, and does not conform to views generally held. And then : \" Berger waved the fairy wand in 1928 ; the transformation of Cinderella was a process of years\", (p. 29). The result of this process is the new electro-physiology of the brain, revealed by the ndings of the electro-encephalogram. The outcome of all this is described in the following way: \"The electrical changes which give rise to the alternating currents of variable frequency and amplitude thus recorded arise in the cells of the brain itself ; there is no question of any other power supply. The brain must be pictured as a vast aggregation of electrical cells, as numerous as the stars of the Galaxy, some 10,000 million of them, through which surge the restless tides of our electrical being, relativelythousands of times more potent than the force of gravity\", (p. 33). Here Dr. Walter speaks of something which is in fact nothing, because to picture the brain \"as a vast aggregation of electrical cells\" is in itself nonsense. The brain does consist of millions of nerve-cells, and a nerve-current running through these cells and their appendant laments and bres can be measured by electrical means. But nobody, so far, has proved that this nerve-current is in itself electrical;it is probably not; yet Dr. Walter speaks condently of \"our electric being\". What is this electric being but a wild television of somethingwhich is of an entirely different nature ? Indeed, Dr. Walter confesses: \"What makes these million cells act together\u2014or indeed what causes a single cell to discharge\u2014^is not known. We are still a long way from any explanation of these basic mechanics of the brain\", (pp. 33/34). Then he describes the way in which an E.E.G. is read, and especially the ingenious device of the toposcope, which helps to decipher the language of the E.E.G. \"E.E.G. records may be considered, then, asthe bits and pieces of a mirror for the brain, itself speculum specu- lorunC*. (p. 35). 3.The following chapters of the book are still more speculative in character than the rst two. It is sometimes astounding to see whatkind of thought-forms can develop if there is no proper understanding for the difference between brain and mii\\,d, 65The third chapter deals with pattern, and comes to the conclusion that: \" Man seeks patterns for his comfort and, in English at least, can boast himself a pattern-making animal\", (p. 41 . This leads to further conclusions in chapters six and seven, wherein ideas on \"Learning about Learning\" and \"Seven Steps from Chance to Meaning\" are computed in such a way that Pavlov's conditioned reflexes, behaviourism and electro-physiology are permutated in order that a \"cybernetics\" of the human brain may emerge as the nal result. T o trace all the errors and mental mistakes in these chapters, one would have to write a new book. On the other hand, in the course of the fourth chapter, \"Revelation by Flicker\", the rst proper facts are described, and here we should start to observe and try to under stand. There is no doubt that we owe a tremendous debt to Dr. Walter, and all those who have worked in the eld of electrophysiology, for their continuous efforts in trying to establish the fundamental laws of the E.E.G. No praise is high enough for their devoted labour, but no scorn and anger are strong enough for the fancy of their theoretical elaborations. One of the rst facts is that the main electric rhythm dischargedfrom the head (not from the brain) appears only when the eyes are shut; as soon as the eyes are opened these rhythms disappear; they also disappear at once when the subject is asked to solve amathematical problem or to concentrate on some visual mental process. Thus a very subtle indication of mental activity is found within the records of an E.E.G. Later it was discovered that this rhythm, which is interrupted by opening the eyes or by mental visualising activities, has a frequencyof 8\u201413 cycles per second and can be clearly distinguished from other rhythms. The former rh5rthm is now commonly called the alpha- rhythm. ^ made when a light-stimulus with a similar rhythm (8\u201413 cycles per second) was applied from without. \"It was foundas expected, that each flash of Ught evoked in the brain a characteristic response . . . strange patterns, new and signicant, emerged from theswift scribbling of the pens in all channels of the E.E.G. (p. 58). These light stimuli were called flickers, and could produce seizures in certain people; but the flicker had also another effect: \"This effect was a vivid illusion of moving patterns whenever one closed one's eyes and allowed the flicker to shine through the eyelids. The illusion is most marked when the flicker is between 8 and 25 ashes per second and takes a variety of forms; Usually it is a sort of pulsating check or mossuc, often in bright colours. At certainfrequencies\u2014around 10 per second\u2014some subjects see whirlingspirals, whirlpools, explosions, Catherine wheels\", (p. 64). 66The explanation which Dr . Walter holds ready for these pheno mena is interesting, because he formulates his problem very clearly :\"The light is stationary; the eyes are shut and do not move; the head and the brain are still. Yet something must move to produce moving patterns\", (p. 69). If Dr. Walter would remain at thisquestion, and not fall back into the preconception that such pheno-mena must arise ''in the brain\" (p. 70) he would have to state . As the eyes do not move, nor the brain, nor the outer Ught, there must beanother realm which either creates these phenomena or is of such a nature that \"flicker\" can evoke these strange reactions. Dr. Walter deduces that a \"scanning mechanism\" must be \"contained in the human head\", and is able to visuaUze this scanning only in the guise of television, \"where a space pattern is most economically converted for transmission into a time sequence of impulses by the scanning mech anism of the camera\", (pp. 69/70). Such a mechanism, however, would never be able to convert rhythmical fUcker stimuli into these manifold moving forms, whichare experienced in all kinds of shades and degrees. If Dr. Walter, and all those who have experienced the great power of flicker-stimuU, followed the logic of the case, they would be led to consider that neither the eye nor the brain is touched by the flicker test, but that these physical organs are by-passed, and that rhythmic light-impulses contact a realm which is so far unknown to us : a realm wherein moving patterns are stirred into active images which present themselves to the human mind. Everyone who suffers from migraine has sometimes experienced, during the onset of such an attack, these strange phenomena of colour-patterns. The realm wherein they arecreated is the realm of those living forces which Rudolf Steiner described as the ether-body of man. Flicker has the power to cause direct reactions in this ether-body, and, as the ether body is a Uving entity, it creates moving and swirling images. The wrong approach to explaining the miracle of the flicker-test, in applying only ideas of feed-back to it, led to the conception of an electrical scanning mechanism ; but, as I said before, nobody has so far been able to prove that nerve-activity is electrical in nature ; this nerve-activity reveals itself by electrical means, but in itseh is not electrical. It is of the same etherio nature as the etheric body ; that is why subtle electric means, such as those of the E.E.G., can indicate the flow of the ether-forces. These forces are irritated by the flicker test to a rath^ high degree, and produce what was described above. At this point thescience of the E.E.G. has made the great discovery of the super sensible sphere of the living forces in man. The scientists wiU have to acquire the courage to acknowledge this fact. 4. The really important parts of the book are contained in chapters eight and nine: \"Intimations of Personality\" and \"Beyond the 67W aking Scene\". In these two chapters proper facts are given, whichare of great signicance for further studies. Here the four different rhythms, which can occur in the records of an E.E.G., are described : The delta-rhythms with 0-5 to 3-5 cycles per second. The theta-rhythms with 4 to 7 cycles per second. The alpha-rhythms with 8 to 13 cycles per second. The beta-rh5rthms with 14 to 30 cycles per second. It took a comparatively long time and many thousands of records before, in a single E.E.G., the differentiation between these four cycles was worked out. Now the science of E.E.G. is so far on as toascribe to each one of these cycles a distinctive connection with special mental activities.The delta-rhythm. This is \"the normal and indeed dominant rhythm in the rst year of life and in sleep\", (p. 54). \"At birth, and for someinonths after, the mam feature of the E.E.G. is still irregular delta rhythms. The more passive and somnolent the infant, the more prominent are the delta rhythms\", (p. 137),The presence of delta-rhythms is also met with in a great variety of bram-defects, such as vascular lesions, neoplasms, atrophy of the cortex, etc. cjIt is therefore justied to describe the delta-rhythms as an mdicator for lack of day-consciousness\u2014as in the little baby or inan individual with a severe brain defect who is dulled in his day- consciousness, or in an adult during sleep. This condition of a considerably lowered day-consciousness can be indicated bv the appearance of the delta-rhythms. ne^eta-rhythms. \"Theta activity is usually dominant in records.: \u00ae years age groups ; it is approximately equal to alphaactivity at 5 6 years; it is smaller above 6 years, and very smallo r i n t e r m i t t e n t a t 1 0 \" . ( p . 1 4 0 ) . ^ Whereas in the small infant only the delta-rhythms can be found they are later replaced by the theta-activity , which is at rst thedominant record but is ^adually superseded by the alpha-rhythms. ^ves a rather clear indication of the gradual development of theE . E . G . r e c o r d s d u r i n g c h i l d h o o d . i - i m e , became clear that theta is associated in some delicatetasliion with pleasure and pain. It is easily evoked in a young childf o r i n s t a n c e , b y f r u s t r a t i o n , b y s n a t c h i n g a w a y a p r o f f e r e d s w e e t In some children the theta activity is clearly associated with affective chanps of any sort; in some it is linked only with pleasant feeline in others only with unpleasant ones\", (p. 140). 'In ordinary circumstances the theta rhythms are scarcely visible m good-tempered adults; but they may be evoked even in them ifthe subject feels himself deeply offended\", (p. 142). \"In bad- tempered adults, especially in those with an unusual tendency to a g g r e ^ i v e b e h a v i o u r , t h e t h e t a r h y t h m s a r e o f t e n p r o m i n e n t \" .\"Visual stimulation at the frequency of the theta rhythm evokes, even in a normal subject, a feeling of annoyance and frustration . . . the mood changes completely without any external emotional stimulus\". Here we nd an entirely different picture : the theta-rhythms ^e connected with a person's more or less uncontrolled emotional life, whether painful or pleasant. This life of feelings is less conscious than our ordinary day consciousness, and we know from Rudolf Steiner that all our feelings are intimately related to our dream- consciousness. Thus the theta-rhythms indicate their connection with the existence of our dreams. This is further substantiated by the fact that these rhythms show a very marked connection with the thalamic regions of the brain, of which Rudolf Steiner spoke in his rst lecture on \"Occult Physiology\", stating that this thalamic region is responsible for evoking our dreams. This is borne out bythe following fact: \"The resulting correlation of the theta rhythm with the thalamus and structures around the third ventricle has been elaborated by Denis Hill in connection with aggressive psychopathy\", (p. 141). The alpha-rhythms. So far, these rhythms are not only the \u00a3ilpha, but also the omega, of all electro-encephalograms. They show certain fundamentcd qualities related to the mental condition of the subject, and it is especially interesting to learn about their gradual appearance during childhood. \"For some time it was thought thatthe alpha rhythms of adult life are rarely found in children less than 8 years old; later analytical technique was more revealing . . (p. 137). After the third year, \"rhythms of the alpha type begin to appear in short bursts, often at considerable amplitude. Insome children of 4 they are even the dominant feature of the record, although the typically infantile rhjdhms are still visible\", (p. 139).\"When the alpha rhythms rst appear in very early childhood, they are scarcely responsive even to arresting visual stimulation ; they begin to show an unmistakable connection with vision only after the age of 3\u20144 years . . . but the classical blocking reaction appears clearly at the age of 6\u20147 in some children. Statistically, adult responsiveness is not found before the age of 10\u201411\". (p- 139). With all these ndings it is clearly shown that alpha-rhjdhms make their appearance only gradually during the course of childhood, and are rmly established at about the age of 10 years. They do not appear before the third year; only after the age of seven do they begin to show what Dr. Walter calls so justiably, \"the classical blocking reaction\"\u2014the reaction which, from the days of Berger on,showed them to be affected by the opening and shutting of the eyes and by concentration on some mental problems. What is now in fact this classical reaction ? We should be very clear about one point: Each of the different rhythms is an indicator of some mental activity; it points to the quality of this mentalactivity , which can be described as a grade of consciousness but notas an electrical force in itself. If mental activity which is related tothe alpha-rhythms is interrupted at the moment when the eyes are opened, or while a visual mental problem is being solved, what kindof quality can it have ? We remember that alpha-rhythms disappear during sleep, and are best obtained when the waking mind is at rest.Therein lie the most important discoveries of electrophysioloey because these facts clearly indicate that the alpha-rhythms are related to a state of consciousness which can be described as \"quietly awake\". The mind is not yet engaged in seeing the outside world or concen trated on a mental problem; a kind of wakeful \"dolce far niente\" is present, which the alpha-rhythms indicate. Dr. Walter takes great pains to show (especially in the third chapter) that a \"scanning-activity\" of the brain, as he calls it isrevealed by the alpha rhythms. I believe it is just the opposite not a scanning activity , but the restful quiescence of day consciousness' IS the background of the alpha forms. Like the even, plane, mirror-'surface of a lake, undisturbed by any moving boat, just shghtly touched by a. gentle breeze, so is our waking consciousness. As soonas a boat cuts through the waters, or a falling stone creates a pattern of npples, the even surface is disturbed. In the same way , as soon ^ our eyes are opened, or our mental activity is xed on a problem,the alpha-rhythms disappear, because the even mirror of our day consciousness is interrupted by mental activity. Nothing else canshow more clearly that every one of the three rhythms, caught in the records of the E.E.G., indicates one of the ordinary realms of consciousness: The delta-rhythms are related to sleep-consciousness. The theta-rhythms are related to dream-consciousness. The alpha-rhythms are related to waking-consciousness. It is not the mental content, contained within each of these three stages of consciousness, which is indicated by any electric waves *it can be pain or pleasure, light from outside or thinking activitvf r o m v n t h m ; i t c a n b e s l e e p b r o u g h t o n b y f a t i g u e o r a s p e c i a l d r u g . It IS the condition itself, not the content within the condition of consciousness, that the E.E.G. reveals.The foUowing statement is noteworthy: \"In no two people arethe alpha-rhythms the same. Not even identical twins have quite identical alpha patterns. But in any one person the pattern is remarkably constant from year to year, once cerebral maturitv hasbeen reached at the age of 14 or so\", (p. 136). Every one of us has his own special and individualized \"lake of peace\", giving him thp foundation for his day consciousness. The beta-rhythms. These very special rhythms are associated With epilepsy , and they \"are well known to be common in tension whether acute or in t& form of chronic anxiety states\" (p. 102)! ' These rhythms are being widely investigated, but to discuss their ! signmcance is beyond the scope of this short article. Nevertheless, 70a closer examination could relate them to a special state of con sciousness, which in the terms of spiritual science is called \"Imagination\". 5. We h a v e n o w c o m e s o f a r t h a t w e c a n u n d e r s t a n d t h e t r u e meaning of the different rhythms within the E.E.G. records. They give us a picture-pattern of the various stages of consciousness relatedto the subject who is investigated. No E.E.G. reveals anything about the content of mental-activity ; it describes only the sphere or spheres in which a mental process happens. Therefore Dr. Walter \"must confess at this stage that no study of brain activity has thrown any light on the peculiar forms of behaviour known variously as second sight, clairvoyance, telepathy, extra-sensory perception and psychokinesis\", (p. 175). And he hasalso to state that \"hypnosis has little or no effect on brain rhythms\", (p. 174). Altogether, the so-called brain-rhythms have hardly anything todo with the brain itself. This is borne out by the statements of other scientic workers in the eld of E.E.G. Denis Williams writes in Clinical Electroencephalography (Modern Trends in Neurology, London, 1951) : \"Recent work has conrmed the earlier nding that cerebral lesions themselves do not give rise to abnormal rhythms. The disturbances which are seen in the E.E.G. in such cases are the result of abnormalities in the surrounding brain, so that the E.E.G. simply reflects the response of the brain to the abnormal state\".Even this statement is a half-truth, because it is not the surrounding brain which reacts to the cerebral lesion, but the changed condition of consciousness, due to this lesion, which creates the disturbance in the E.E.G. records. We should also note what Denis WiUiams has to say in the same paper about the diagnostic value of the E.E.G. : \"It is unusual forthe test itself to provide absolute evidence in support of a single diagnosis, and it should certainly never be used with this end in view.A large number of normal people have abnormal records, and many epileptics have normal ones; the degree of abnormality varies greatly, and many disorders which have a profound effect on the patient may be unassociated with any abnormality in the E.E.G.\".This statement describes quite clearly what I have pointed to above ; it is not the content of the mental activity, but its condition of consciousness, that is represented in the ndings of an E.E.G. Therefore, also, mental illness \"is usually accompanied only bythe most subtle and evanescent changes in the E.E.G\". (p. 154) 6. Should we now be satised with our ndings, or stiU tty to go one step further ? Do we know anything about our conditions of con sciousness ? Have they at all been described and investigated ? To modern psychology a good amount of their contents is known, but only Rudolf Steiner has described them as conditions per se, 71^ e y r e v e a l t h e m s e l v e s t o t h e c l a i r v o y a n t e y e o f t h e s e e r , a n d t o h i mthey make their appearance in the form of the human aura. Thishuman aura is described by Rudolf Steiner in some detail in his book Theosophy (Kegan Paul, London, 1922). There he states: 1 he aura vanes greatly according to the different temperaments and dispositions of people; it varies also in accordance with the stages of spiritual development. A man who yields completely tohis animal impulses has an entirely different aura from one who lives much in the world of thought. The aura of a religiously disposed nature differs essentially from one that loses itself in the trivial experiences of the day. In addition to this, all varying moods, allinclinations, joys and pains nd their expression in the aura\". Now we can understand that, in varying degrees, the forms and patterns of the aura are detected by the devices of an E.E.G. It isnot an electro-encephalogram at aU, but an aura-gram revealed by e l e c t r i c m e a n s . ^ AA^en Rudolf Steiner then continues to describe certain aspectsm the chan^ng conditions of the aura, he says, for instance: beehngs of injured dignity which expend themselves in a sudden v^Uing up can be seen appearing in dark green clouds ... If oneobserves a man in a t of terror one sees this for instance in the aura from top to bottom as undulating stripes of blue colour, suffusedwith a bluish-red shimmer . . . Persons ^ continuous flickering of smallreddish-blue spots 'absent- mindedness' shows bluish flecks playing over into green and more or less changing in form\". These phenomena, which are so precisely described here, are similar to the phenomena which are recorded by the E.E.G. A closer study of the human aura and the various charts of an E.E.G.will show their intimate relationship. What the clairvoyant eye describes in vivid colour-experiences is in a more abstract way depicted by the wntings of an E.E.G. record. This record is the shadow theelectnc shadow, of the vivid, colourful life of the human aura. This aura, however, is in immediate interplay with our ether- body , and receives from it its colours and patterns. The aura, as a phenomenon of human soul-activities, is clothed with ether-forces.These ether-forces are revealed by electrical means, and as they are me intimate veil of the aura, the E.E.G. becomes an aura-gram. Electnc potentials detect the ether-forces ; the ether-forces are the garment of the aura; hence the moving and changing patterns ofthe aura appear via the ether-body in the rhythms of the E.E.G. 1.Never the brain-cells swept through by electrical activitv. Electncal forces permeate the whole physical structure of man andnave a special place of resistance and concentration around the skull therefore, they can be most easily traced there. It is a similar 72phenomenon to the one of the northern lights, which are best seen in the polar regions of the globe ; there they appear around and above the earth and correspond to the weather-conditions of the surrounding atmosphere. No-one would think that the earth is nothing but a body for creating the aurora borealis. So also is thebrain not in the least a structure which is nothing but a tremendous electronic computing machine. The aurora borealis is an indicator of the atmospheric conditions in the same sort of way that the E.E.G. is a record of human conditions of consciousness. When Dr. Walshe, one of the most eminent neurologists of our time and a very clear thinker, gave the Hughling Jackson Lecture in December, 1952 on \"Thoughts upon the Equation of Mind with Brain\" [Brain, Vol. 76, part I, 1953) he said : \"We must abandon the assumption that the human person is nothing more than a focus for the hurrying to and fro of molecules, or his mind no more than a bloodless dance of action potentials . . . and nally we have to accept the ancient concept of the soul again : as an immaterial, non- corporeal part of the human person, and yet an integral part of his nature, not just some concomitant aspect of man, but something without which he is not a human person\". At the end of his lecture. Dr. Walshe describes quite justiably the modern representatives of the electric-computor school of psychology in the following words : \"This is the Peter Pan school of science, the exponents of which do not grow up, but are now always popping up before the footlights, beseeching us to believe in theirelectronic fairies, lest their naive hypotheses die untimely\". The same words hold good for this book. The Living Brain. The title is entirely wrong. What it presents is a ghost-like spectre of the real brain, a structure so little known, yet so intricate and beautiful, that only in some centuries to come will man be able to start understanding it. Dr. Walter's book is a most dangerous piece of writing, simply because the layman who reads it will be fascinated by its brilliance and the subtle way in which facts and fancies are mixed together and replaced by one another.If men such as Dr. Walter cannot resist computing their ideas into unfounded statements, the public should be educated in order to be able to distinguish between right and wrong. It is more than dangerous to utter the following defamation,: \"Wherever two orthree nerve cells are gathered together , a seizure may occur\", (p. 61). This is sheer slander, and I should like to end this review with the words used by Dr. Walshe in concluding his above-mentioned lecture : \"For me, the chill physico-mathematical concept of the human mind is a muddy vesture of decay in which I am not willing to be enfolded. It is unworthy of the dignity of Man. Man was not made for science, but science by man, who remains more and greater than his creations,\" 73THE SIEGE OF THE SENSES Michael Wilson W H A T E V E R m a y p r o v e t o b e t h e p o l i t i c a l r i g h t s a n d w r o n g s of commercial television, it is evident that the Englishmanhas a canny fear that if it were allowed in this country he might well nd that he had thrown open the gate of his castle to a kind of Trojan Horse. We do in fact regard as slightly unfair the kind of attack which IS planned to catch us off our guard by confronting us with an advertise ment just at the moment when our attention is occupied with some thing else. As we travel on foot or by train it is the poster or theflashing sign which catches our eye ; as we read our paper or journalit is the advertisement in the margin or between the pages of text which claims our grudging attention; while the prospect of beingentked to open our susceptibilities to a musical performance onlyto have detergents or deodorants hurled at us, is altogether too nauseating to contemplate. Of course it would not be as crude asso we are told\u2014but the fact remains that if the advertiserwere compelled to say , \"Now I am going to advertise at you\", before he displayed his wares, then it would no longer pay to advertise. Even apart from advertising, our senses, particularly those of seeing and hearing, are the targets of a constant barrage of manufactured or reproduced information in the form of written matter, drawings and photographs, telephone, lms, radio and now television.Let us take a closer look at the way in wliich some of these things work. ^ * * Many people who watched the televised Coronation found thatthey were unexpectedly moved by the dignity and solemnity of thewhole occasion. It was therefore surprising that the two subsequent full-length lms m colour dealing with the same event, for the most part with the same sights and sounds, should have left one with sucha sense of emptiness and disappointment. Evidently the usual methods of lm production and editing demanded that the general tempo should be increased and that on no account should our interestbe allowed to flag. But flag it did, for what we found ourselves watching was not the unfolding of a great historical event, but thelm makers' idea of what is good entertainment. Through having to condense ve hours into one, the very quality which should have been conveyed was lost, and the spectator was unable to reconstruct It for himself. In ordinary f^-making it is accepted that the selecting, cutting, tming and piecing together of the numerous sequences that havebeen photographed is quite as important as the work of the actorsoften more so, It is in fact perfectly possible to show a sequence of 74pictures in such a way that the impression built up in the mindsof the spectators is a train of thought which has nothing whatever to do with the actual events photographed. What, then, is the essence of all that is conveyed to us by cinema screen, television tube and loudspeaker ? When we look at a movie, whether in the cinema or on a television set, we owe the appearance of movement to an unconscious function of our own organism\u2014the instinct to put successive pictures together into the idea of continuous movement. If there are less than about ten pictures per second, we shall see them as separate pictures and there there will be no impression of smooth movement. As the number of pictures per second increases we become unable to see them as separate, but they join up into the appearance of continuous movements. This is due partly to the comparative slowness of our eye in perceiving changes, and partly to certain forces in us which tend to join up the separate parts of our experience into an intelligible and continuous pattern. The usual number of pictures is twenty- four per second. If we could perceive the actual movement of the pictures as they flit by in succession, with a dark interval between each, then the cinema would become an instrument of the most exquisite torture. This inborn faculty of joining up, or integrating as we term it nowadays, is fundamental to the whole illusion of the moving pictureand is mostly quite beyond our control. It is intimately connected with the forces of growth which hold our body together year after year in the same recognisable shape. But that it is we ourselveswho do it is clearly shown in such instances as when a lm is taken of a two-bladed aeroplane propeller in motion. Let us suppose that in the first picture the blades are in the 'Twelve o'clock\u2014six o'clock\" position, and by the time the second picture is taken they have moved around clockwise nearly half a revolution to the \"five o'clock\u2014eleveu o'clock\" position, and by the third picture to the \"ten o'clock\u2014four o'clock\" position. The true movement of the one blade is from twelve o'clock to ve o'clock to ten o'clock, but we cannot help taking the easier course and connecting the successive positions of alternate blades, namely twelve o'clock to eleven o'clock to ten o'clock and integrating them into a much slower movement in an anti-clockwise direction. This effect with turning wheels and pro pellers will be familiar to all cinema-goers and is mentioned only forthe involuntary way in which our integrating takes the easiest course, regardless of whether it is the correct one or not. Another piece of integrating which is almost as involuntary, and which we are continually doing in our waking life, is to combine the views from different viewpoints into the idea of three-dimensional space. First we do it with the views from our two eyes, and thenin addition we do it with the different views we get as we walk about. Indeed, so long as we can change our viewpoint even if only by moving 75our head, we can perceive \"depth\" of space almost as effectively with one eye as with two. This is what the lm cameraman does when he gently wheels his camera sideways or winds it up or down to a different level while he is actually shooting a particular scene, and it enables us to integrate the different viewpoints into a very good idea of the three-dimensional space of the whole scene. After seeing the lm which was recently advertised as \"3-D as it should be seen\" the writer observed that his memories of the various scenes depicted were neither more nor less spatial than they would have been after seeing a well-photographed two-dimensional version of the same thing. Only for conveying impressions of space which are too unusual ortoo dangerous to be common experiences, does the inconvenience and expense of the strictly stereoscopic system seem to be really justied. It will be interesting to watch this development when oncethe novelty has worn off. * * In television, the picture is still further broken down, and corres pondingly we are called upon to do still more integrating in puttingit together again. We are in fact watching the antics of a single bright point of light smaller than the head of a pin. If we imaginean artist with a soft pencil drawing a picture by ruling straight lines across the paper very close together and making each line lighter or heavier as he goes along it according to the demands of the picture which is to appear, (many advertisements are drawn in this kind of style nowadays), and if we further imagine that it requires just underfour hundred hnes to ll up each picture, and that the artist has to draw twenty-ve such completed pictures in each second, then for a moving picture the size of an average television screen his pencil will have to rush back and forth across the paper at a speed of the order of ten thousand miles an hour, without getting tired and without making mistakes. But this is just what the pin-point of light is doing all the time upon the television screen, and we are sitting comfortably in our armchair allowing the life-forces of our bodyto integrate the antics of this spot of light into the scenery of West minster or Wimbledon. What is actually transmitted \"on the air\" is a form of electrical energy whose strength varies in a continuously changing pattern\u2014a pattern which in essence could be represented by a single wavy hne\u2014and this pattern when translated into hghtand dark, chopped up and correctly tted together again hke a jigsaw puzzle, enables us to reconstruct the original scene with its splendour or its thriUs. The reproduction of music and of the human voice, though tech nically much simpler than television, is in itself an even greatermiracle or perhaps an even greater sin. Edison's invention of the phonograph showed that not only could the human voice make itsown impression upon a rotating cyhnder of wax, but that this impres sion could be trasmitted back to the air in such a way that a recognisable imitation of the original voice would arise. What 76is actually recorded is nothing but a wavy groove in the wax surface, or a, wavy boundary on the sound track of the To-day every schoolboy knows what a sound-track is and what it does, and wehave quite lost all sense for the wonder that it contains. For is itnot truly miraculous that the expressive power of the human voice, the individual colours of all the instruments of the orchestra, and in fact the whole world of emotion and magic of a Beethoven or a Wagnershould be imprisoned as if by a spell into the pattern of a single wavy line, ready to be conjured up again whenever and whereverwe choose to make the wavy line impart its pattern to the moyenient of the air ? Here indeed the music and the word undergo a kind of death and resuscitation, in that they vanish altogether from our ken until the gramophone or loudspeaker calls them up again into a semblance of being. Of course %ur ordinary scientic, explanations do not describe it like this, but nobody whose inner being receiv^ new life through the experience of music really believes that musicis nothing but a lot of mechanical vibrations which can be recorded on wire, wax, or lm, any more than the recording engineer really beheves that actually locked up in the connes of his wavy line is all the spirituahty of a Beethoven quartet. The question is a real one, but we mostly do not trouble to face it squarely . What can be preserved, is a pattern impressed into matter ;what can be experienced is the whole range of human understanding and emotion. The two things are in different worlds, worlds which meet only on the level of rhythmical movement. When the pattern can be made to reveal itself as rhythmical movement, it is able to become the vessel for the immaterial inner qualities wluch we experience in the world of tone\u2014the quaUties of music and of thehuman voice. Whereas pictures deal mostly with the external appearance of things, sounds take us at once to the inner natureof the thing that utters them, and it is a great question whether the gramophone is not a much more infernal instrument of deception than the camera and all that has followed from it. For even the bestphotograph or 3-D colour lm wiU not deceive us into thinking that we are witnessing the original scene, whereas we can easily meet with conditions where it is very difcult to tell whether we are hsten- ing to a real voice or to its reproduction. This raises a cardinal question ; Is the invention a better one for imitating the reality more closely, or is it for that very repon l^s stimulating to the imagination and therefore more deadening in itsinfluence ? Here it seems necessary to distmguish between sights and sounds, for whereas the barest thumbnaU sketch can convey a wonderfully living impression, a crude imitation of the human voice would strike nobody as having artistic value. All pictures, in so far as they are representational, are shadows of a greate^e^ty , and in thinking us incomplete, leave us a certaui degree ot tteedona,leave something for us to do for ourselves. Sounds on the other hand 77always real. There is no such thing as a picture of a sound whichis not itself a sound of some kind. Therefore the mechanical re production of the human voice is a piece of deception at a far deeperlevel than any reproduction of visual impressions can reach. * H n * Let us try to clarify this relation between the mechanics of com munication and the content of what is communicated. Here is a simple experiment with some small dots punched out of black paperand then arranged in various ways. There are just a hundred of these small pieces, and the same pieces have been used in each of the four gures in the illustration, [see overleaf] Fig. 1 The arrangement is irregular and the dots tell us nothing buttheir shape and size. Fig. 2 The arrangement does not convey much at rst sight, butwhen turned upside down and viewed from a distance of a couple of yards, it will probably convey a meaning which is quite irreconcilable with the shape of the dots themselves. (Most of the photographic illustrations in books and news papers make use of this principle). Fig. 3 The arrangement is all that matters, for we jump at onceto the meaning of the sentence, regardless of whether theletters are made up of lines or round dots or any other shapes. Fig. 4 A combination of three rhythmic spacings. If the blackdots were air-holes in the revolving plate of a siren, this pattern would produce the sound of a major chord in music. It will at once be evident that it must be a matter of complete indifference to any dot whether it represents part of a mere jumble or part of a human face, part of a word or just an air vibration It is in every case the pattern that is signicant, and the pattern could be just the same if the dots were crosses or stars or of any other shape or colour. In fact the meaning of the arrangement is not on the material level at all. The material arrangement serves only to give us the cue for calling up a certain pictorial image in (2) and certain abstract thoughts in (3). In the case of (4) our intellect can only extract from the arrangement the rhythmic proportions 4-5-6, and it is only when these proportions are embodied into rhythmic movementsof the air that an actual musical sound arises for our sense of hearing. Everything therefore that can be recorded by means of writing, drawing, photographing, etc., contains this truth : that the materialrecord which is preserved is no more than a kind of cue or reminder which prompts us to set our thinking, our imagination, to work.If we are familiar with the conventions employed\u2014the language, the style of drawing, the laws of perspective and the conventionso f d r a m a o r f i l m p r o d u c t i o n \u2014 w e s h a l l h a v e n o d i f f i c u l t y i n c o n s t r u c t i n gfor ourselves the kind of inner experience which the author wish^iK to have. If we are unfamiliar with the conventions, then we shall be able to make little or nothing of the records. Our perceptwn of the content of these things is not a physical process at all; u is our thinking ego that does the perceiving, and this is already the beginning of supersensible activity. What comes to us through our bo^lysenses is only a substratum; the content is of a purely spiritual character. Like most of Man's inventions, these processes of commumcation and recording are a kind of unconscious projection of what takes place within himself. In the external world rhythmic patterns are trans mitted, usually electrically ; in Man the nerve impulses are also rhythmic and are able to generate minute electrical currents.' In neither the external nor the internal process is the actual cowtewtot our perception to be found, although without the rhythmical patternsthere is no perception. What is more remarkable is that the brain physiologists tell us that the nerve impulses can go to one part ot tnebrain and give rise to sensations of light, and that impulses of precisely the same kind can go to another part of the brain a.nd produce sensations of sound, or even of touch or taste.' What is conveyed by the nerves bears even less resemblance to the content ol the perception than the wireless waves bear to the nished television picture.

But in 1897, when the possibUity of airship flight was much m men s minds, the popular observations which fUled the newspapers contained many features which could belong only to the current ideas of thebehaviovtr of an airship. Fifty years later , the same basic phenomena are described with features which reflect current notions about space travel and the possible inhabitants of other planets. The future of civilisation will be very largely influenced by the mental pictures which Man makes for himself. The pure discovery of Nature's secrets is giving place to the wilful creation of a new world which was not there before. So far, this new world looks hke being one in which the forces of disintegration will play a leading part- disintegration not only at the material level, as for instance m theliberation of atomic energy, but also at the level of human thinkingand human feeling. For the bonds of race and religion which formerly held human society together with such force are beginning to wea.ken, and if a man cannot nd his own inner foundations for life he is either conscious of being a lonely soul or else is content to drift with the stream. This kind of moral disintegration is a challenge\u2014even a necessary prelude\u2014to the development of fully responsible inmindu-ality : for it is just in this inner chaos and uncertainty that freedoniis to be found\u2014^in the realm where Man consciously builds his mental images, his inner idea-pictures, by bringing together what he abstractsfrom his sense perceptions and what he nds as impulses and idea s at the core of his innermost being. It is here that the bwle lor possession of the human soul is being fought, and here that Chnst s words, \"I wiU make you free\", can have real meamng. The Siege will continue. We shall have more lms, more tele vision and still more complete illusion. There will be more plausible reasons for it, and indeed there will be many ways in which these inventions can be of real service to mankind, such as we found m the handling of the televised Coronation. There will also be sincereartists trving to express themselves in these media, though their free dom wiU become more and more curtaUed.

It isa surprising fact; for in this country his reputation rests on his last poetry , an intensely personal and spiritual account of the world, strangely out of touch with many contemporary trends and fashions,and yet in some respects very close to Rudolf Steiner's picture of the world. Many readers of the Golden Blade will remember Herr Steffen's article in the 1949 issue, in which he dealt with Rilke and Cezanne. He stressed the differences in outlook between himself and Rilke, and Rilke's cool, rather non-committal reaction to a lecture by Rudolf Steiner ; and nally he pointed to certain features of Rilke's view of man and the world, at which he, as an anthroposophist, looked askance. We were also given an impression of the striking personality of Rilke, whom Steffen met during the war of 1914\u201418. Another account of meetings with Rilke is given by Hans Carossa, who rst saw Rilke at the very same time and place as Steffen had done. Carossa is Germany's most important contemporary writer; he has had personal contact with anthroposophists and is a medical doctor and Goetheanist. His account and criticism of Rilke take up 18 pages of an autobiographical book, \"Fiihrung und Geleii\". We are concerned with one passage only, which is, however, not isolated, but the climax of Carossa's whole argument. He is quoting Rilke, though not in the latter's own words, as saying: \"He had learned from Rodin to look so often and so penetratingly at a tree an animal, a statue, a man or an historical gure, until suddenly there appeared within him an essential vision {eine wesenhafte Erscheinung) of the object contemplated\". Carossa continues: \"This method was not completely unknown to me ; a small anthro- posophical essay which had come to my notice stated the same;Kiif T rnnsidered such spiritual training much too difcult and lengthy to think myself capable of it\". These two statements seem to suggest that Rilke's method of coenition and creation was not identical with Rudolf Stdner's app roach and yet that the two had so much in common that a verysensitive observer thought they were, essentially , in agreement with each other. In this essay I shall have to refrain from treating Rilke as a poetin order not to overrun my limits, and must keep to a discussion of 83his spintual development. Nor do I feel quaUed to pronounceon the question\u2014discussed by Steffen and Rilke\u2014whether the poet gams or loses by an accumulation of precisely formulated spiritual The time when Steffen and Carossa met the poet was the darkest period of Rilke's life. The war had shattered him, deprived him ofthe places which had become his home, and cut him off from themain- spnng of his imagination. While conceivably Rilke might havereacted more positively to Rudolf Steiner at another period of his hfe, there was a second, more fundamental obstacle in his way .All his life he had been frightened of receiving knowledge, a revulsion from the typical nineteenth-century education he had had at schoolHis contacts had to be personal and intimate to bear any fruit. Indeed, it is one of Rilke's claims to greatness that in this ageof intellectuahsm he never dealt in other men's experiences and ideas. Here is a poet who once shocked his friends with the confession that he could not remember having read either Hamlet or Faust. What Rilke had to say is the fruit of his own insight into the mysteries of existence, and he speaks his own, unique language. It is tragicthat because of these peculiarities Mke id not recognise the genius of Rudolf Steiner; it is inspiring to see Rilke in his own struggling and independent effort come so near to Rudolf Steiner's method and to some of the latter's discoveries. This is why an understanding of Rudolf Steiner's work is so valuable an aid for the study of Rilke's later poetry. Usually Rilke's critics take one of two lines. If schooled in French symbolism they are inclined to treat Rilke's poetry as an imaginative and poeticcreation which contains no 'message'; while the German-trained scholar tries to discover a denite philosophy which he goes on to test, nds untenable and therefore discards. It is the burden of this essay to treat Rilke as a 'teacher', as distinct from a philosopher oran artist in an ivory tower. Rilke's development led to a conscious preparation for artistic creation which is closely bound up with moral and spiritual values, the general signicance of which Rilke was able to perceive. Rilke's importance as a teacher hes in the fact that, as already stated, heachieved a unique and personal vision and then realised that he had found a new and universally valid approach to life. Here he is in obvious contrast with such outstanding men as Thomas Mann or C. :S. Lewis, whose imaginative life (20th century) is sharply divided from their conscious intellect, which harks back, in the one caseto the late nineteenth century, in the other to the Middle Ages Rilke's vision arises out of a unique interplay of imagination, intellact and meditation, and ought to be of great interest alike to the anthro- posophist and to the general reader.We must try to nd in Rilke's poetry not so many ideas, but spiritual processes : in fact, active meditation or the fruit of meditation. Subjective as the imagery is, we again and again enter a region which is common to us all. A region which contains no static ideas, but growth and development, a truly dynamic life. T o take as an example the eleventh poem of the second part of the Sonnets to Orpheus ; if read as a logical statement, this poem seems to condone cruelty and drew a very bitter comment from an unusually sensitivecritic, J. B. Leishman. In reality, the poet takes us through three stages of dealing with an experience, three stages which are clearlydemarcated by three dots which separate one from two, and again two from three. The rst stage describes an unusual and rather unsportsmanlike form of shooting birds, evidently most repugnantto the sensitive poet. So, as an inner exercise, he forces himself, in the second part of the poem, to take this chase into pure vision, to have it before the inner eye in all its details without allowing the emotions to rise up and interfere. This pure vision crystallises into the intuitive insight that killing, destruction, is an essential part of our existence on earth. But then the poet rises above this insight and redeems it. In his meditation he no longer views the slaughter from without, he experiences it from within, and himself becomes the object and victim :* Many a rule of death rose with deliberate rightness, onwardly-conquering man, during your hunting past: better than trap or net known to me, fluttering whiteness, you they were wont to hang down in the cavernous Karst. Gently letting you in, as were you a token publishing peace. But then : vassal would twitch at your thong. Night would cast from the caves pallid handful of broken- flighted doves to the lightNot even that, though, was wrong. Far from the gazer remains every emotion but gladness, not from the hunter alone, gathering, watchful and keen, that which his suns have matured. Killing merely is one form of our wandering sadness .. .Pure in the spirit serene Is all we ourselves have endured. * The English translations of the poems used are by J. B. Leishman and Stephen Spender, (Hogarth Press). They produce the atmosphere of theorinnal and could hardly be improved upon. But we ought to note that in line 12 of the foUowing poem, 'merely' is not suggested by the text of the original and diminishes the emphasis of the hne. In line 9, 'every emotion but gladness- seems unwarranted when the German demands sometiimg like any suggestionof regret*. And it ought to be added that the word translated beautifully by 'gazei' suggests in German 'beholder', one cpntemplating a vision or meditation. 85This element of meditation permeates much of Riike*s later work, and is the subject of the last of the Sonnets : Silent friend of so much distance, feeling how your breath goes on enlarging space, ll the darkest belfry with your pealing.You are gnawed by something growing apace stronger than the feeding strength it borrows.Wander through transforming shad^ or shine. Which has grieved you most of all your sorrows ? Turn, if drinking's bitter, into wine. Be, in this immeasurable night,at your senses' cross-ways magic cunning, be the sense of their mysterious tryst. And, should earthliness forget you quite,murmur to the quiet earth : I'm running. Speak to the swift water : I exist, Rilke's work falls into three periods : search, awareness, ful lment. The rst period is no longer of compelling interest, and attracts the biographer and psychologist more than the lover of poetry. It culminates in two works. The Book of Hours, and The Lay of Love and Death of Cornet Christopher Rilke, both out standing among contemporary poetry, yet not on a level with Rilke's later work. To understand the latter, we need know very little of what happened to the poet before his twenty-eighth year. He was bom in Prague in 1875. The psychologist might dwell on his un happy and frustrated childhood, on the boarding school reminiscentof a nineteenth-century EngUsh public school, with its lack of privacy and its insensitive masters and boys. For us it is important merely to notice his^ mother's sentimental religious life, which destroyed for ever Rilke's belief in Christianity, and the unimaginative teaching at school, which made him question for ever the value of education as he had seen it, handing on established standards from generation to generation. From now on Rilke was engaged in a lonely search in which no organised church, no traditional belief in the classics or other permanent values, could support him. His rst creations were rather unpromising attempts in verse, prose and drama : sentimental, vague, often lush. Two journeys to Russia, a luting experience, increased his native tendency to mysticism.The decisive influence, however, was to come from the West. A journey to Italy and a prolonged stay at the artists' colony at Worps-wede had aroused his interest in the visual arts and the artist; and thus pepated, he met Rodin in Paris. The impression which the great ScTi^lor mad:e on him was so profound that Rilke went to hvein Paris 86and acted for some time as Rodin s secretary. Under the impact of Paris and with a new-found vision of the artist's task, three great works were completed: New Poems, Requiem, and The Notebook of Malte Laurids Brigge. The title. New Poems, was chosen with great care, and in its matter-of-factness contrasts with the somewhat flamboyant titles of Rilke's earher work ; it means what it says ; for these poems spring from a new creative attitude. The language has become more austere, the rhyme less exuberant and sensual, and for the rst time Rilke attempts great poetry without rhyme. These poems spring from a new source For soon after the turn of the century he realised that the artist ought not to float happily along until a moment of in spiration broke upon him, but that he ought consciously to give formto his whole life, and to school his spirit. \"In former years (he writes to his wife) nature was for me a general stimulus .... I did not sit in front of her; I let myself be enthused by the soul which radiated from me ... . I walked along and beheld, not nature, but the visions which she inspired\". To achieve this new vision, new faculties had to be awakened. In another letter he describes how one day he was unable to appreciatethe pictures in the Louvre. He was tired. But what was this tiredness ? \"That I allowed all sorts of things to come into my mind; that all sorts of things went through my mind hke water through a mirrored image, dissolving my contours into something fluid. And I said to myself : I do not want any longer to be the mirrored image but that which is on top. And I turned round so that nolongVl stood on my head, and closed my eyes for a short moment and contracted myself all around and tightened my outlines as y o u t i g h t e n t h e s t r i n g s o f a v i o h n u n t i l t h e y a r e t a u t a n d r e s o n a n t \" . He now approaches the picture once more and nds it more revealing t h a n e v e r b e f o r e . . The letter continues : Do you see, this is what one will have to be able to do one day\". Not to wait for inspiration and to be at the mercy of one's moods, but to work on oneself, and then let the objects(die binge) speak out through the newly-found powers with which you confront them. Poetry , which for Rilke had been so easy , now becomes a tremendous task which needs complete surrender : \"Not counting two short interruptions, I have for weeks not spoken one word ; at last my soUtude closes, and I am in my work as the stone in the fruit\". * * * During the last two or three generations, four views of the artistin our society have been given prominence. First, the romantic, or better pseudo-romantic view\u2014the interesting, sensitive man, the man who articulately cries, \"If I might say so\"\u2014; secondly, the bringer 87of pieastlre and joy\u2014a sequel to the art-for-art's-sake movement, and still believed in by Sir Osbert Sitwell and Somerset Maugham ; thirdly, the mouthpiece of society; and nally, the mouthpiece of the world. Unconsciously, Rilke began somewhere between the rst and second attitude, but once awakened to consciousness, he decided for the last possibihty. To give utterance to the essential quaUty or virtue of a thing is no new task for an artist; it meant only re-discovering something that had almost been forgotten. But during the nineteenth century the scientic spirit of objectivity had spread far aeld. And Rilke reahsed that it was necessary to forgo even the privilege of selection if the poet was to full his highest function in the new age. To select means to be led by one's personal bias ; it is, in Rilke's terminology, tantamount to judging. The artist's task is, to use another word beloved by Rilke, to say ; that is, to lend sound to the mute creature and to the objects so that they might testify to their own nature. In this connection Rilke quotes Baudelaire's poem La Charogne and says (the translation is J. B. Leishman's) : \"Artistic observation had rst to make such a conquest of itself as to be able to see even in the horrible and apparently only repulsive that existence, which, together with all other existences,counts. Aversion from any kind of existence is as httle permitted to the creator as selection ; a single withdrawal at any time thrusts him from the state of grace, makes him wholly and entirely sinful\". It might be good to pause here for an instant and realise that Rilke's conception of the poet is of universal moral and spiritual signicance. He strengthens his powers of concentration, confrontsnature in an act of meditative beholding and persists until the object confronted reveals its essence. Thereby he puts his powers of cog nition at the service of the world of mute creatures ; and, later, at the seivice of the dead. Having established his method, Rilke might have gone on to explore the world of Die Dinge ; and, indeed, this aspect of his worknever ceased completely. But something qmte unlooked for hap pened : he realised that this method of cognition opened up for himan utterly different world\u2014the supersensible, the world of the dead and the world of the angels. They could not be consciously focussed, as the objects could be meditated, but Rilke experienced how they were able to enter the mind, if only it was properly prepared and ready. From now on the intuitive element plays again a larger part; but always it has at its basis a conscious preparation. Requiem consists of two most remarkable poems ; a third, shorterpoem, was added at a later date. They do not praise or commemorate the dead, nor do they lament man's mortal state. They aremeant as a help to two dead people : one, the \u00aew i f e a n d a n a r t i s t w h o m h e h i m s e l f ^ y o u n g m a n w h o m h e h a d n e v e r m e t . B y t h i s t i m e R i l k e h a d b e e nused to conversing with the dead. I'm not afraid to look upon the dead. When they return they have a right to hospitalitywithin our gaze, the same as other things. He never took death as the negation of Ufe. Y et hedeaths of these two particular people sometlung ^^ had eone wrong The young man had ended by suicide , the ar , a woman, in childbed exclaiming \"What a shame !\"a r e d i s c u s s i o n s b e t w e e n t h e p o e t a n d t h e d e a d i n o r d e r t o h d p t h e mon their way .

Had you once perceived how fate may pass into a verse _ and not come back, how, once in, it turns image, nothing but image, but an ancestor,who sometimes, when you watch him in his frame, seems to he like you and again not like you : you would have persevered. Parallel with the writing of New Poems and Requiem, went The Notebook of Malte Laurids Brigge, a novel, Rilke's purgatory. It deals with a sensitive young Dane in Paris who undergoes the same experiences as Rilke himself, but succumbs to their terror. HereRilke delves deeply into his own existence, and learns to rise above it. All that held terror for him is here gone through again, tasted to the full and experienced once more\u2014^and left behind forever, hardly to occur in his work again. \u00ab \u00ab * Great as the New Poems, the Requiem and The Notebooks are, Rilke's fame rests on the work of his last period, and by these it will stand or fall. To this period belong the Duino Elegies, the Sonnetsto Orpheus, and Last Poems, collected posthumously . The history of the Elegies and Sonnets needs special mention ; for here we can study the part which the conscious and the unconscious play, preparation and inspiration. , In January, 1912, Rilke stayed at the beautiful old castle of Duino, built on a rock which falls steeply into the Adriatic over 100 feet below. He stayed there alone, and one morning was walking in the park thinking of a reply to a business letter he had just received. A strong southerly gale was blowing. He suddenly stopped, for out of the wind a voice called to him : Who, if I cried, would hear me among the angelic orders ? He took out his notebook which, Uke Beethoven, he always carried with him. A few more lines followed. He realised that he stoodat the beginning of his greatest work. Y et he went to his room and wrote his reply to the business letter. By the evening the First Elegy was nished. The Second Elegy followed soon after . A fewfragments were also written down indicative of the large proportions of the work he had undertaken. The next two years saw only the completion of the Third Elegy , while the rest of the work hardlyprogressed. Y et now he became conscious of the task he had takenon The poem Turning speaks for the rst time of limits of seeing, and realises that the more the world is seen in its essence, the more does it need love from the beholder to acquire its fullest stature. And then the poem concludes : Work of sight is achieved, now for some heart-work on all those pictures, those prisoned pictures within you ! Y ou conquered them ; but do not know them as yet. Behold, 0 man within, the maiden within you !\u2014 creature won from a thousand natures, creature only just won, but never, as yet, beloved. 90Rii.ke in Muzot\u2014 \"(III pied dc ma tour forte\". and Poet\",by Nora andCo. (Puhliahers) LtdHe was convinced that this work would not only be his greatest, but constitute his life's mission ; and when soon afterwards war broke out and shattered Rilke's creative genius, the experience was the more terrible as the poet realised now for the rst time what was demanded from him, and saw at the same time his inability to achieve this task. In the four years of the war he was able to write only one more elegy, the Fourth. After the war he looked for a place wliere he could give himself completely to his supreme task, and he nally settled in the Chateau de Muzot. He lived alone in this little keep in the Valais, and con sciously formed his life so that through concentration he miglitbe led to another poetic inspiration. That great moment came in February, 1922, ten years after the inception of the Elegies. For some time Rilke had felt he was approaching a period of artistic creation, when the letter of a bereaved mother and an engraving of Orpheus in a shop window set his mind are. In four days he wrotea cycle of twenty-six sonnets without having to correct a single word, sent them to the mother, and two days later posted one more sonnet in exchange for one which was not considered good enougli. On the same evening work at the Elegies was resumed, and two days later they seemed complete with the jubilant Ninth. But the end had not yet come. Two days later he wrote the Tenth Elegy, which leads us beyond death into a world where there is no longer any differencebetween what so far had been internal and external ; three days later another elegy followed to replace the former Fifth, and during the next ve days there were written twenty-nine more sonnets, the Second Part of the Sonnets to Orpheus. All this poetic activity ' was conned to less than three weeks, a climax of intense creation, unparalleled perhaps in literature, though not in music.Rilke showed a completely different attitude to the Elegies and to the Sonnets. The former were the natural conclusion of a ten-years' struggle ; the later were a surprise given to him, a by-product for whichhe was not responsible, perhaps even a trifle. His critics do not share this view. For them, the Sonnets and the Elegies are twin products, explaining and illuminating each other. The Elegies look at humanexistence predominantly in a strain of lament ; the Sonnets have resolved the tensions and contradictions of our life, and their main theme is praise. On the whole, critics are inclined to rate the Sonnets even higher than the Elegies. Rilke, however, who had consciously prepared himself for this great climax, realised he had reached his goal. He authorised his publisher to prepare his collected works, as he knew he could add little, if anything, to what he had said already. * * * About the contents of these two works many volumes have been written. The best interpreter of Rilke's work is, however, Rilke. With a knowledge of the work of his middle period, his letters, and in particular, the letter to his Polish translator, which English readers 91can study best in Leishman's introduction to the Sonnets, the poetryitself will not be forbidding to the sympathetic reader . I shall only be able to touch upon a few points regarding the experience of the world which underlies these two works. Behold J 0 man^ the maiden within you ! What then is the world to him who beheld the maiden within ? First there is revealed a vast sum of 'correspondences'. What used to be seen at the time of the iVew Poems as an isolated object, is now ex perienced as an objectivisation of an inner possession of man Every thing 'seen' is revealed as part of man himself. And so man learnsto feel himself as a citizen of two worlds, an inner and an outer , oflife and death ; but they are not two worlds divided by a pre-ordained and rigid boundary ; rather they constitute a whole. The Whole. On this experience Rilke bases himself rmly ; he attacks on the one hand this maclune-age which wishes to deny the reality of the other half of expenence, and the Church on the other hand which tnes to shake man s condence in the reality and goodness of the here and now, and emphasises the other-worldliness of anunexpenenced realm Our task is threefold : to see and praise theobject m Its dness to realise that ultimately it is part of ourselves ;and nally , and most important, to receive it into us with all the power transform the worldand biuld up a new heaven and a new earth, where everything isi n v i s i b l e a n d f e h i o n e d o u t o f t h e s t u f f o f o u r m e d i t a t i o n i n d y e tcontains the thing in its full reality . Transformation in this senseI S m a n s s u p r e m e t a s k Y e t o t h e r b e i n g s h a v e a l r e a d y a c c o m p l i s h e dwhat we have har^y begun. T o the Angels the past is present and existent, because for a long time it has, to them, been invisible that IS, it has changed into inner experience. Their existence is far above ours : Early successes, Creation's pampered darlings,* ranges, summits, dawn-red ridges of all beginning,\u2014pollen of blossoming godhead, hinges of light, corridors, stairways, thrones, spaces of being, shields of felicity, tumults of stormily rapturous feeling, and suddenly , separate mirrors, drawing up their own outstreamed beauty into their faces again. Compared with the Angel, man is transient, and again and againstands before the riddle of his own nature. Y et while this might elude him in meditation, it is revealed in active life. The twelfthsonnet of the rst part maintains 'we act in true relation', and praises the spirit which gives meaning to our life and joins it with the lives of others. t I cannot belp feeling that these words are too coUoquial and effeminatef o r t h r i Te r w o h n t m d e r S c h d p f u n g . w e m i n a t e 92The view of life to which the Sonnets and the Elegies testify lives also in all Rilke's other utterances of the last period of his life. The Letters to a Young Woman, published posthumously, are particularly interesting, for in these letters he gives advice to a person in needof comfort and guidance, and what he says there is in full agreement with the vision expressed in his poetry. * * We now can summarise: Rilke is the modem poet who creates out of his own vision and meditation, and whose last and greatest works are the product of a conscious meditative life and intuition bestowed by grace. More than any other modem poet, he exhorts us to love this world and train our senses to a full and valid experience of the object. Yet he insists that man must do something for the objectaswell -he must meet it with loving understanding and spiritualise it. Thus man realises his mission. All this makes us under stand Carossa's statement, quoted at the beginning of this article, thatRilke's approach seemed to him related to Ant^oposophy . Leishman, who apparently does not know of Rudolf Sterner, has two passages in his introduction to the Sonnets which are immediately arresting to the student of Anthroposophy. They show Rilke's impact on our time. Leishman says : \"No other writer is so full of the future ; no other gives us such thrilling intimations of that inheritance on whose thresholdwe are standing, and which our civihsation may be about to enter , if it does not perish through its own destractive forces . A n d f u r t h e r : \"For Rilke as for Aristotle, what Aristotle caUs happiness and what Rilke calls 'reality' is an activity of the spint, andrhe hiSwnd of actiW is that impassioned contemplationwliemlhoug^^^^^^ resolved into the thing it contemplates\".Without a guide or the help of a tradition, Rilke attained to a oart of the essential vision of the twentieth century, and thereforeWs work rSav be i'^terest to students of Rudolf Steiner ,whom Rilke himself refused as his teacher . There are a good many p o i n t s w h e r e t h e i d e a s o f t h e s e t w o c o n t e r r g i o r a n e s a g r e e , w h i l ethe two most fundamental dif ferences between Rudolf Steiner s teach i n g a n d R i l k e ' s v i e w c o n c e r n t h e q u e s t i o n s o f m a n s e t e r n a l i n d i w d u -aliTv and of Christ However, these differences are not quite asS n d a m e n t a l a f t h e v a p p e a r t o b e .

The only thing Rilke knew about the latter weresentimental stories of his nursery , and he could not look up to beings who had been presented to him in such a fashion. Again, it is pos sible that his reaction to the descriptions of the modern investigator of the spiritual world might have been quite different. And the question of the eternal individuality? Steffen points out that Rilke felt here on shifting ground. He could speak of reincarnation, and yet in the Ninth Elegy went out of his way to stress the fact that we live on earth but once. Rilke's references to re- o xxxxxxoxxxxx^ oxxxx^ cxi.u dccepr It, ana balance against It one of the Sonnets to Orpheus (ii, 27), in which destructive time is recognised as an lUusion and man appears eternal when viewed bv the great Powers that remain for ever. Rilke was neither a philosopher nor an aestheticist nor was he the pupil of any master . As he was, he went a long way in his lonelv quest of truth, and many a reader, entranced at rst perhaps bv hisnoble language and incomparable imagery, may have been eiven an insight into the world which he could have received, morepreciselvand completely, only from Rudolf Steiner : precisely Breathing, invisible poem !

Sylvia EckersleyRUDOLF STEINER'S 'lETTERS\" Owen Bareld der Rudolf Steiner Nachlassverwaltung, Dornoch, Switzerland).* T h e r s t v o l u m e o f R u d o l f S t e i n e r ' s L e t t e r s , w h i c h w a sreviewed in the 1950 issue of the Golden Blade, covered the period 1881 1891. The second volume covers the period 1892\u20141902, but is prefaced by a small collection of letters belonging in time to the earlier volume. We are not told by the editors whether this is because they have come to light since the publication of V olume I but it may well be so. Among them is a letter of the 29th August, 1891 which English people in particular would be sorry to have missed as it includes some valuable remarks on Shelley's Prometheus Unbound and a comparison of it with Goethe's unnished poem. It is addressed to Helene Richter, who had sent him an essay on S h e l l p ^ . ^ ^ ^ g g g g ^ y s e v e r a l t i m e s , a n d m y o p i n i o n r e m a i n s that it is not only not an ill-bred child, but rather a particularly promising one, needing only a little rening and polishing to make itQuite excellent. Y ou have developed the basic idea of Prometheus in a verv striking way. The one feature of your interpretation which seems to me a little doubtful is your criticism of Goethe's treatment of the Prometheus saga. With Goethe, the human nature embodied in Prometheus appears not at all as one that asserts itself in endless oride against the Creator of the world, but rather as one impelled to create out of its own self the highest that the world can offer, and which therefore rejects every divine principle that works upon it man becomes aware that the highest potency of existence has offered itself up in endless love in order to come to life again in the human soul, and there to accomplish deeds of freedom, in that same moment he is bound to regard every god that stands outside him as a pseudo-god whose tyranny he must resist. Fundamentally , Shellev's Prometheus agrees with this, for in the last resort the freeing of the fettered gure through wisdom and love means only that the fettering ceases at the moment when the highest potency of being which is slumbering within him, and is in fact wisdom and love, is spt free Then Man realises that the fetters which he has beenw e a r i n f a r e o n l y t h e f e t t e r s o f a p s e u d o - g o d , a n d t h a t t h e y f a l lf r o m h f s l i m b s a t t h e m o m e n t w h e n Z e u s , t h e g o d o f t h e m a n w h o i s Tint awakened to full self-consciousness, dissolves into nothingness.SLd'^l^Se his Prometheus, he would certainly have embodied in it this basic idea.

I , Price \u00a32 Os. 3d.\"There is no doubt, however, that the ageing Goethe no longer believed in the same way in the power of this self-consciousness \u2014a power which would have enabled him to complete the poem. What happened, rather, was that in his inner being he drew nearer to Jupiter, and with this a withdrawal from Prometheus necessarily goes hand in hand. Whether we should regret this, I do not know.It seems to me, however, that the deepening insight into the real world of appearances, to which we owe the later poems of Goethe, impelled him to attribute to nature a quality of divinity which goes uneasily with any idea of man's freeing himself absolutely by his own efforts\". I should like to quote also a reference to Emerson, in a letter to Pauhne Specht dated 24th December, 1893 : \"I strive with all my might, in contrast to the German philistine style, to be human and individual in my writing. The Germans writeno style at aU. I see this best now I am reading the English essajdsts\u2014in particular, Emerson. No German could construct asentence such as this, in Emerson's essay on Goethe: \"I nd a provision, in the constitution of the world, for the writer or secretary,who is to report the doings of the miraculous spirit of life that every where throbs and works. His ofce is a reception of the facts into the nmd, and then a selection of the eminent and characteristic experiences\". If you want a real pleasure, then read Representative Men, by Ralph Waldo Emerson. I am convinced you will derive the greatest satisfaction from it\". This second volume now appearing does not pretend to reproduce more than a selection of the letters written during the period it covers. Steiner was not a prolific letter-writer\u2014again and again he begins by accusing himself of Schreibfaulheit, Saumseligkeitand other epistolary sins\u2014but even so, the Introduction speaks of many letters still presumably hidden among the effects of theirdeceased recipients, and of others known to have been destroyed during the war. As the ret volmne included, besides the letters, a lecture of the wnter's on his early life, so the present volume includes an interesting lecture, given in 1918 and consisting mainly of reminiscences of thetime (1894) when the rst edition of The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity was published. It was an excellent idea to preserve thesetwo lectures in this way, and it is to be hoped that the practice will be followed in subsequent volumes, if similar lectures are available. The ten years up to 1902 were full of very varied activities, and were perhaps those in which Steiner was most directly in touch with the intellectual and political world about him. In 1897 he leftW e i m a r f o r B e r l i n a n d b e g a n a l m o s t i m m e d i a t e l y e d i t i n g t h e M a g a z i n fUr Littera^r. The letters suggest a whirl of lecturing, journalism,proof-reading, and eager argument. At one moment he is strikinga blow for Drejdus, at another speaking from the same platform as 98Rosa Luxembourg. There is a last, curious glimpse of him applying, on the advice of a friend, and unsuccessfully, for the post of \"feuilleton editor\" on a Viennese daily paper: \"I followed all your advice as to externals\u2014i.e., the sort of collar you said, stiff hat, gloves. I felt you were absolutely right (it has left me completely broke)\". And then in 1902 he attends a meeting of the Theosophical Con gress in London, and a few months later is appointed General Secretaryof the German Section of the Theosophical Society. The by now familiar names of Rosa Mayreder, Pauline Specht, Edouard von Hartmann, Ernst Haeckel, vanish from the page, and the last twenty- ve of the hundred and sixty-one letters covering the period are almost without exception addressed to Wilhelm Hubbe-Schleiden, who was associated with him in the founding of the German Section. They disclose, sometimes between the lines and sometimes more frankly, his views of the leading personalities in the Theosophical Society\u2014Annie Besant, the \"Buddhistic dandy\" Jinjaradasa andothers\u2014^his awareness of the risk he was taking, and his determination to develop German theosophy from a basis of Western philosophical thought. The lives of most men become more crammed and complicated as they grow older, and Rudolf Steiner's was no exception. Consequentlythe gure which the letters in this volume disclose lacks the clear and sharp outlines, and the simple, vivid glimpses, which made the peculiar charm of Volume I. In quantity alone. Volume II is nearlyhalf as long again. What did he himself remember in later life as the deepest impressions and experiences, or the greatest excitements, of these ten years ? If the letters\u2014and they are not necessarily a safe guide\u2014are to be believed, I would say there were three things. The conclusion and publication of The Philosophy Spiritual Activity, to which he attached such importance and in which he did not fear to display his own condence ; the impact of Nietzsche (\"Have you seen Nietzsche's Antichrist ? One of the most signicant books that has been written for centuries ... I hear every nuance of the Nietzsche-Sprache ...\"); and the decision to work with the Theo sophical Society. On the 4th November, 1894, about a year after the publication of The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity, he writes from Weimar to Rosa Mayreder: \"I know exactly where my book belongs within the stream of contemporary culture; I can show precisely where it joins on toNietzsche's line of thought; I can say with condence that I have expressed the ideas that are lacking in Nietzsche. I may admit to my friends\u2014^but only to them\u2014that I feel very sad that Nietzschewas never able to read my book. He would have taken it as what it is ; in every line a personal experience. \"T o you I must say the following ; if you had rejected my book, it would have been incomparably painful for me. You tell me the 99book is too short, and that a whole book could have been made out of each chapter. I cannot contradict this remark in as far as it is objectively meant. The explanation lies in my own subjectivity.I don't teach; I relate what I have inwardly experienced. I relate it as I have experienced it. Everything in my book is personally thought out. Also the form of the thoughts. Anyone with a teaching disposition could extend it. Perhaps I could, too, at the right time.For the time being I want to describe the biography of a soul wrestling its way up to freedom. One cannot do anything for those who want to accompany one over cliffs and abysses. One must get oneself over. Too great a yearning for the goal burns within one for it to be possible to stop and explain to others how they can get across most easily. I believe that if I had simultaneously tried to nd a suitable way for others, I should have fallen. I went my way as well as I could; it was this way that I described. After that I could perhaps nd a hundred ways which others might take, but I did notwant to put down any of them on paper immediately. Haphazardly and quite individually, I have jumped over many cliffs, and have worked my way through thickets in my own fashion. It is only when one reaches the goal that one knows that one is there. Perhaps the time for teaching in these matters is over. Philosophy interests me now almost exclusively as the experience of the individual\". The Notes, which comprise nearly a quarter of the 440 pages of the book, are beyond praise, and with their full and carefully selected illustrative quotations from Steiner's own writings, those of his correspondents, contemporary periodicals, and other sources, areas interesting as the letters themselves ; in many cases more so, for more of these than one could wish are mere business communications to his publishers and perfunctory notes about his movements and appointments. The plates include a frontispiece photograph of Rudolf Steiner in 1922 ; two (bearded) photographs taken in 1896, and a particularly attractive one of him addressing a Workers' Education Class in 1900. There are also photographs of his father and mother. I feel impelled to conclude this brief notice by quoting the Geleitworte by Marie Steiner, printed on the flyleaf : Die Sie a UNETT LTD..
