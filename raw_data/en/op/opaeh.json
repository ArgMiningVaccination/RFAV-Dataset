The following criteria are evaluated: Disease prevalence Disease complexity Potential for reducing complications, improving quality Current cost of managing the disease Existence of an evidence -based clinical guideline to assist practitioners in the management of the disease Value to the Participating Provider, Member and GHP Family if the program is implemented Case Management leadership determines the need for a specific Case Management/Disease Management program based upon the criteria listed above and submits a proposal to GHP Family's Medical Management Administrative Committee and Quality Improvement Committee for review and approval. Actively practicing 26 practitioners are particip ating Member s of Case Management/Disease Management teams and assist in the development, implementation, and monitoring of new and established Case Management/Disease Management programs. Practitioner Program Content The design of all Case Management/Disease Management programs includes, but is not limited to: evidence - based clinical guidelines, Member identification, passive or active enrollment, stratification, interventions based on stratification level, practitioner decision support and evaluation of p rogram effectiveness. Evidence -based clinical guidelines are a core component of all Disease Management programs. Board certified SCPs and/or PCPs are involved in the review and approval of evidenced -based guidelines. Clinical guidelines are reviewed every two years or when the appropriate guideline team, GHP Family's Guideline Committee and the Quality Improvement Committee make recommendations. Identified primary and SCPs are involved in the development and review of new Case Management/Disease Management programs. GHP Family's Case Management Department and the accompanying teams are responsible for program content that is consistent with current clinical practice guidelines. Evidence -based guidelines are posted online at www.ghpfamily.com , and announc ements are made in the provider newsletter, Briefly , to inform practitioners of their availability. Printed copies or electronic PDF files are available upon request for practitioners who do not have Internet access by contacting GHP Family's Case Management department at (570) 271- 8763 or toll free (800) 883- 6355, Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Identification of Members who benefit from Case Management/Disease Management programs is accomplished through Claim s analysis using standard clinical specifications from criteria such as the Heal th Plan Employer Data & Information Set (HEDIS \u00ae). Member identification is also facilitated by direct referrals from primary and SCP s, the Member and/or family, and from various GHP Family departments including Medical Management, Customer Service, Appeals, and Quality Improvement. Enrollment and Patient Participation All Members with a disease -specific diagnosis are identified by Claim s analysis and/or HEDIS \u00ae criteria and mailed a disease- specific informational newsletter. Members are informed of their enrollment in the program and have the opportunity to \"opt out\" by contacting GHP Family's Case Management Department. All enrollees receive disease- specific informational newsletters each year to increase their knowledge of disease self -management. Each n ewsletter also encourages the Members to become \"active\" participants in the disease management program(s). A Member becomes actively enrolled in the appropriate disease management program when the Member contacts GHP Family's Case Management Department directly, is referred by a Health Care Provider or a GHP Family department, or accepts an invitation extended by GHP Family's Case Management Department (through disease -specific Member newsletters or direct Member invitation by letter or phone as the result of Claim s analysis information). A Case Manager/Health Manager reviews the referral information and contacts the Member to either schedule an office appointment with the Proven Health Navigator Health/Case Manager or to arrange to routinely communicate with the Member telephonically. After the Member's verbal and/or written consent for participation is obtained, the Member is actively enrolled in the appropriate program. 27 Risk stratification Case Managers/Health Managers stratify active Members based on clinical criteria according to low, moderate or high risk. For example, Members enrolled in the Congestive H eart Failure program are stratified according to the American College of Cardiology (ACC). Members with diabetes are stratified using glycosolated hemoglobin (A1c) control and the presence of risk factors. Interventions The degree of intervention is based on the Member's risk stratification. For example, a Member classified as low risk receives a minimum of one (1) program informational newsletter each year, self -management education, a plan of care, and one or more follow -up office or phone appointments. A Member with a high -risk stratification receives these interventions in addition to more frequent office/phone visits and referrals for necessary specialty or case management services. Practitioner decision support The Case Management/Disease Management decision support model includes evidence -based clinical guidelines (previously described), Case Managers/Health Managers, the plan of care, and the Practitioner Quality Feedback Report. The program is designed for actively practicing PCPs . Case Managers/H ealth Managers are key to providing collaborative \"real time\" decision support to PCP s. The Case Manager/Health Manager follow internally developed education Care Paths (Algorithms) that complement the clinical guidelines. The education Care Paths (Algorit hms) provide a framework for self - management education, the recommended laboratory/diagnostic studies, and targeted clinical goals. The plan of care includes information regarding the Member's self -management of their condition, barriers, special consider ations or exceptions, review of medical test results, management of co -morbidities, collaborative goal -setting and problem -solving, medication review, plans for follow -up, and preventive health monitoring. The plan of care is reviewed and discussed by the PCP and/or SCP and the Case Manager/Health Manager in person, by phone, or through an electronic medical record messaging process. Additional decision support information is mailed to Participating Providers annually from the Case Management administrative staff in the form of a letter accompanied by the Practitioner Quality Feedback Report. The involvement of the practitioner is integral in the design of program content for all Case Management/Disease programs. Practitioner participation ensures program content is appropriate for the actively practicing PCP . All PCP s are surveyed annually in order to elicit feedback regarding the program(s). Evaluation of program effectiveness Program effectiveness is measured by conducting a pre- and post -analysis of pertinent clinical measures, annual Member/practitioner program satisfaction surveys and pre- and post -comparisons of services utilized by Members in the programs. 28 Practitioner's Rights Practitioners who care for Members have the right to: Obtain information regarding Case Management/Disease Management programs and services in conjunction with GHP Family as outlined herein; and Obtain information regarding the qualifications of the Case Management staff; and Obtain information regarding how the Case Management staff facilitates interventions via treatment plans for individual Members; and Know how to contact the Case Managers/Health Managers responsible for managing and communicating with their patients; and Request the support of the Case Manager/Health Manager to make decisions interactively with Members regarding their health care; and Receive courteous and respectful treatment from Case Management staff at all times; and File a Complaint when dissatisfied with any component of the Case M anagement/Health Management programs by contacting the Case Management Department at (570) 271- 8763, toll free at (800) 883- 6355, or the customer service team at the number listed on your patient's insurance card.

MEMBER RESTRICTION PROGRAM DPW's Bureau of Program Integrity manages a centralized Member Restriction Program for all managed care and Fee- For-Service delivery systems. GHP Family maintains a Member Restriction Program that interfaces with the centralized program and cooperates with DPW. The program identifies, restricts and monitors Members who have been determined to be abusing and/or misusing Med ical Assistance services or who may be defrauding the HealthChoices program. With the approval of DPW, Members may be restricted to receiving services from a single, designated provider for a period of five years. GHP Family's Special Needs Unit monitors and evaluates the utilization of Members who are referred to the Member Restriction Program. Providers will receive notification of Members who are restricted and restrictions are enforced through the Claim s payment system. GHP Family may not pay for a service rendered by any provider other than the one to whom the Member is restricted, unless the services are furnished in response to an emergency or a Medical Assistance Member Referral Form (MA 45) is completed and submitted with the Claim . The MA 45 must be obtained from the practitioner to whom the Member is restricted. If a Member is restricted to a provider with your provider type, the EVS will notify you if the Member is locked into you or another provider. The EVS will also indicate all type(s) or provider(s) to which the Member is restricted. Valid emergency services are excluded from the lock -in process. GHP Family obtains approval from DPW prior to implementing a restriction, including approval of written p olicies and procedures and correspondence to restricted Members. GHP Family will: Refer to DPW's Bureau of Program Integrity (BPI) those Members identified as over utilizing or misutilizing health care services. Evaluate the degree of Abuse including review of pharmacy and medical Claim s history, diagnoses and other documentation, as applicable. Propose whether the Member should be restricted to obtaining services from a single, designated provider for a period of five years. Forward case information and supporting documentation to BPI for review to determine appropriateness of restriction and to approve the action. Upon BPI approval, GHP Family will send notification via certified mail to Member of proposed restriction, including r eason for restriction, effective date and length of restriction, name of designated provider(s) and option to change Provider, with a copy to BPI. Send notification of Member's restriction to the designated provider(s) and the County Assistance Office. Enforce the restrictions through appropriate notifications and edits in the Claim s payment system. Prepare and present case at a DPW Fair Hearing to support restriction action. Monitor subsequent utilization to ensure compliance. Change the selected provider per the Member's or provider's request within thirty (30) days from the date of the request, with prompt notification to BPI through the Intranet provider change process. 59 Continue a Member restriction from the previous delivery system as a Memb er enrolls in the managed care organization, with written notification to BPI. Review the Member's services prior to the end of the five -year period of restriction to determine if the restriction should be removed or maintained, with notification of the results of the review to BPI, Member, provider(s) and County Assistance Office. Perform necessary administrative activities to maintain accurate records. Educate Members and providers to the restriction program, including explanations in handbooks and printed materials. Members have the right to appeal a restriction by requesting a DPW Fair Hearing. Members may not file a Complaint or Grievance with GHP Family regarding the restriction action. A request for a DPW Fair Hearing must be in writing, signed by the Member and sent to: Department of Public Welfare Office of Medical Assistance Programs of Bureau of Program Integrity Division of Program and Provider Compliance: Member Restriction Section P.O.

An advance directive is a legal document through which a Member may provide directions or expre ss preferences concernin g his or her medical care and/or to appoint someone to act on his or her behalf. Advance directives are used when the Member is unable to make or communicate decisions about his or her medical treatme nt. Advance directives are prepared before any condition or circumstance occurs that causes the Member to be unable to actively make a decision about his or her medical care. In Pennsylvania, there are two types of advance directives: Living will or he alth care instructions Appointment of a Health Care Power of Attorney Providers are require d to comp ly with federal and state laws regarding advance directiv es (also known as health care power of attorney and liv ing wills), as well as contractual requirements, for adult Member s. In addition, GHP Family requires that providers obtain and mai ntain advance directive information in the Member's me dical record. Requirements for pro viders include: Maintaining written policies that address a Member 's right to make decisions about their medical care, including the right to refuse care Providing Members w ith written information about advance directives Documenting the Member 's advance directives or lack of one in his or her medical record Communicating the Member 's wishes to attending staff in hospitals or other facilities Not discriminating against a Member or making treatment conditional on the basis of his or he r decision to have or not have an advance directive Providing staff education on issues related to advance directives GHP Family pr ovides informatio n about advance directi ves to Member s in the Member Handbook , including the Member 's right to ma ke decisions about their medical care, how to obt ain assistance in completing or filing a living will or he alth care pow er of attorney, and general instructions. For additi onal informatio n or Complaint s regarding noncomplia nce with advance directi ve requirements, you can contact: Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General 74 Strawberry Square, 16th Floor Harrisburg, PA 17120 Phone: (717) 787- 3391 REIMBURSEMENT & CLAIMS SUBMISSION REIMBURSEMENT/FEE-FOR GHP Family will reimburse Participating Providers at fee- for-service rates described in the Participating Provider's individual GHP Family Agreement. BILLING INSTRUCTIONS Medical Assistance Enrollment & PROMISe ID Number Required All providers who provide services to HealthChoices Member s must be enrolled in the Commonwealth's Medical Assistance (MA) program and possess an active PROMISe Provider ID in order to bill for services. For information on how to enroll in PROMISe and enrollment forms, please visit the DPW's Web site at: http://www.dpw.state.pa.us/provider/promise/enrollmentinformation/index.htm . Member Eligibility Verification A MA Identification Card, titled Pennsylvania ACCESS C ard, is an identification card issued by DPW to each MA recipient . The card can be used by MA -enrolled Health Care Providers to access DPW 's Eligibility Verification System (EVS) and verify the recipient's MA eligibility and specific covered benefits. Prior to rendering or billing for services, providers should verify each Member 's eligibility for benefits through the online eligibility information from the EVS. The EVS offers Medicaid provi ders the information to make an informed decision prior to rendering a service or item. The plastic ACCESS Card has a magnetic strip designed for swiping through a point -of-sale (POS) device to access eligibility information through the EVS. The MA recipi ent's current eligibility status and verification of which MCO they may be participating with can be obtained by either swiping the ACCESS Card or by calling the EVS phone number (800) 766 -5387. If a Member presents to a Provider's office and states he/she is a MA recipient, but does not have an ACCESS Card, eligibility can still be obtained by using the Member's date of birth (DOB) and Social Security number (SS#) when the call is placed to EVS. For more information regarding the EVS and ways to access eligibility data, visit the following: http://www.dpw.state.pa.us/provider/doingbusinesswithdpw/softwareandservicevendors/eligibilityverificatio ninformation/index.htm . In addition to the ACCESS Card , Members will receive a GHP Family identification card upon enrollment with GHP Family. Below is a sampl e of the GPH Family identification card: 75 Payment for Medically Necessa ry Services In accordance with Pennsylvania Code 55, Chapter 1101, DPW will only pay for Medically Necessary services for covered benefits. DPW defines Medically Necessary services as a service or benefit that is compensable under the MA Program and meets any one of t he following standards: The service or benefit will, or is reasonably expect ed to prevent the onset of an illness, condition or d isability. The service or benefit will, or is reasonably expect ed to reduce or ameliorate the physical, mental or developme ntal effects of an illn ess, condition, injury or disability. The service or benefit will assist the Member to achieve or m aintain maximum functi onal capaci ty in performing daily activities, taking into accoun t both the functi onal capacit y of the Member and those functional capacities that are appropriate for Member s of the same age. Determination of Medical Necessit y for covered car e and services, whether made on a Prior Auth orization, Concurrent Review , Retrospective Review , or on a n exception ba sis, must be documented in writing. The dete rmination is based on medical information pr ovided by the Member , the Member 's family/caretaker and the PCP , as well as any other providers, prog rams, agencies that have evaluated the Member . All Medical Necessity deter minations must be made by quali fied and trained health care providers. DPW has established benefit packages based on category of assistance, program status code, age, and, for some packages, the existence of Medicare coverage or a Deprivation Qualifyi ng Code. Participating Providers are expected to provide services in the amount, duration and scope set forth by DPW and based on the Member's benefit package. GHP Family will ensure that services are sufficient in amount, duration, or scope to reasonably be expected to achieve the purpose for which the services are furnished. GHP Family will not arbitrarily deny or reduce the amount, duration or scope of a Medically Necessary service sol ely because of the Member's diagnosis, type of illness or condition. Provider Billing GHP Family accepts both electronic and ma nual Claim s submi ssions. To assist us in proce and pa Claim s efficie timely, GHP Family encourages prov iders to submi t Claim s electronically. To facilitate electronic Claim s submi ssions, GHP Family has developed business relationships with major clearinghous es, including WebMD /Envoy. GHP Family receives EDI Claim s directly from these clearinghous es, processes them throug h pre-import edits t o ensure the validity of the data, HIPAA compliance and Member enrollment and then uploads them each Business Day . 76 Within 24 hours of file receipt, GHP Family provides produc tion reports and control totals to all trading partners to validate success ful transactions and identify errors for correction and resubmi ssion. Providers can s ubmit paper Claim s to GHP Family 's designated post office box. Paper Claim s are scanne d into our system each Business Day . Geisinger Health Plan or Claims Administrator P.O. Box 8200 Danville, PA 17821- 8200 Co-payments Certain services require a Member co-payment. This amount should be collected from the Member by the provide r and deducted from the amount billed to GHP Family . Providers must submit all Claim s whether or not the Member made full payment. Providers should not deny services to a Member even if the Member has not made full payment of their cost -sharing amounts. It is important for providers to document on t he Claim submitted the amount that the Member paid or the amount the provider has billed to the Member . Coordi nation of Benefits/Third Party GHP Family is the primary payer on t he following services: Preventive care OB/GYN Prenatal or pr eventive pediatric care (including EPSDT services to children), and services to children having medical coverage unde r a Title IV-D child s uppo rt order GHP Family is the payer of last resort on all other services. Providers must bill third party insurance before submitting a Claim to GHP Family . GHP Family will pay the difference bet ween the primary insurance payment and GHP Family allowable amount. Providers cannot balance bill Member s. If the primary insuranc e carrier denie s the Claim as a non-covered service, the Claim with the denial may be submitted to GHP Family for a coverage determination u nder the Member 's prog ram. It is the provider's responsibility to obtai n the primar y insurance carrier' s explanation of benefits (EOB) or the remitta nce advice for services rendere d to Member s that have insuranc e in additio n to GHP Family . The pr imary carrie r's EOB or remittance advice should accom pany any Claim s submitted for payment. A detailed explanation of how the Claim was paid or d enied should be included if not evident from the primary carrier's E OB or t he remittance advice. T his information is essential in order for GHP Family to coordinate benefits. If a service is non-covered or benefits have been exhausted from the prima ry carrier , the provider is required to get an upda ted letter every January and July to submi t with each Claim . Claims submi tted without the EOB for Member s where third party insurance is indicated will be denied in most cases. In the event a Claim is paid by GHP Family and it is later discovered the Member has other insurance, the pa yment made to the prov ider will be recovered by either GHP Family or D PW. 77 GHP Family will neither unreasonably delay payment nor deny payment of Claims because they involved an injury stemming from an accident such as a motor vehicle accident, where the services are otherwise covered. Those funds under the scope of these Other Resources shall be recovered and retained by the Commonwealth. If assistance with the billin g of third party payers is required, please contact a Provider Relations Representative at (800) 876- 5357. To prevent denial s for coding mismatc hes, Claim s submitte d to the primary carrier on a form that differs from GHP Family 's requirement s should be clearl y marked with COB Form Type Conversion. Timely Claim Submission Requirements GHP Family requires that Claim s be submitted within 180 days from the date of service. Providers have 12 months from the date of service to correct and resubmit Claim s if the initial submission was within the 180 day time period whether or not the Claim was denied on the first submission.

GHP FAMILY PAY -FOR-QUALITY PROGRAM GHP Family's Pay -for-Quality program was initiated to encourage and promote the focus of quality care for GHP Family M embers. The Pay -for-Quality program is available to physicians in primary care (i.e., Family Practice, Internal Medicine, and Pediatrics) and Obstetrics and Gynecology. Each specialty within primary care is considered separately. Additionally, qualifying PCPs meeting measurement thresholds for each applicable category are eligible for reimbursement through the Pay- for-Quality incentive pa yment. Physicians are rewarded for meeting and exceeding certain clinical measurement categories. The Pay -for-Quality program is not meant to be a static measurement system and will remain flexible in order to meet changing clinical practices and quality requirements. 80 Pay-for-Quality reports will be posted on GHP Family's Web site at a primary care site level, so that Members can judge the combined performance of all the physicians in a given practice. Those reports will be refreshed every quarter . More information about the Pay -for-Quality p rogram (including the GHP Family Pay -for-Quality Manual) is available online at www.ghpfamily.com . Your Provider Relations Representative is also available to work with you in meeting Pay-for-Quality measurement criteria to maximize your incentive.

Prescription stockpiling : Member attempts to \"game\" their drug coverage by obtaining and storing large quantities of drugs t o avoid out -of-pocket costs, to protect against periods of non- coverage (i.e., by purchasing a large amount of prescription drugs and then disenrolling), or for purposes of resale on the black market. Doctor shopping : Member or other individual consults a number of doctors for the purpose of inappropriately obtaining multiple prescriptions for narcotic painkillers or other drugs. Doctor shopping might be indicative of an underlying scheme, such as stockpiling or resale on the black market. Improper Coordina tion of Benefits : Improper coordination of benefits where Member fails to disclose multiple coverage policies, or leverages various coverage policies to \"game\" the system. Marketing Schemes : A Member may be victimized by a marketing scheme where a s ponsor , or its agents or brokers, violates the marketing g uidelines, or other applicable Federal or state laws, rules, and regulations to improperly enroll a MA beneficiary .

Prescription drug shorting: Pharmacist provides less than the prescribed quantity and intentionally does not inform the Member or make arrangements to provide the balance but bills for the fully- prescribed amount. Bait and switch pricing: Bait and switch pricing occurs when a Member is led to believe that drug will cost one price, but at the point of sale the Member is charged a higher amount. Prescription forging or altering: Where existing prescriptions are altered, by an individual without the prescriber's permission to increase qu antity or number of refills. Dispensing expired or adulterated prescription drugs: Pharmacies dispense drugs that are expired, or have not been stored or handled in accordance with manufacturer and FDA requirements. Prescription refill errors: A pharmacist provides the incorrect number of refills prescribed by the provider. Illegal remuneration schemes: Pharmacy is offered, or paid, or solicits, or receives unlawful remuneration to induce or reward the pharmacy to switch Member s to different drugs, influen ce prescribers to prescribe different drugs, or steer Member s to plans. 95 PROVIDER SELF- AUDIT PROTOCOL The Pennsylvania MA Provider Self Audit Protocol allows providers to voluntarily disclose overpayments or improper payments of MA funds.
