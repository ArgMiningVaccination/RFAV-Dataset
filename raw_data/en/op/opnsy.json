From the outset, I consider it is important to mention that, every year, the process leading to the publication of the Ombudsperson for Children's Annual Report is a lengthy and challenging one. Prior to report - writing, investigations are carried out on a daily basis (see chapter 7). Activities promoting the rights of children are organised regularly, and several meetings by and outside the Ombudsperson for Children's Office (OCO) are attended by myself and Invest igators (refer to chapter 6). In order for the report to capture our hard work in favour of children of the Republic of Mauritius, my staff and I have to be trained, disciplined and determined. We neither have in our midst a professional photographer nor an editor, unlike other offices who are involved in similar activities internationally. I have to put the publication of this report into context so that all those who are really concerned by the welfare of our children make an effort to read this documen t and, consider and implement the recommendations made. I can assure you that all recommendations proposed in our reports are not made overnight. They are well thought out and formulated after in -depth investigations and based on international research work. The field work carried out by my team and I help us better appraise the social realities that children face. In addition, we carry out desk research during each of our enquiries as it is sine qua non in the formulation of relevant and evidence -based re commendations . I believe that these recommendations have the potential to help State and non -State actors working in the field of children's rights to improve the quality of their services. This is my fifth report as Ombudsperson for Children and, once ag ain, I feel that I am fulfilling an important duty - the promotion and protection of the rights of children of the Republic of Mauritius bearing in mind the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) . Similar to all children around the gl obe, children of our Republic are equal rights holders and all children are a vulnerable population. However, one must admit that some children are more vulnerable than others. Most of the time, these children cannot rely on social safety networks to face the difficult situations General Introduction | 14 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children they find themselves into on a regular basis. As advanced by the World Bank (as cited in SOS Children's Villages International, 2016)1, Child vulnerability is a downward spiral where each shock leads to a new level of vulnerabili ty, and each new level opens up a host of new risks. In other words, the probability of a child experiencing a negative outcome rises with each shock. Across all my Annual Reports since 2016, I have written about several individual and systemic investigat ions in relation to children's rights, and made recommendations related to various vulnerable groups of children including: children in conflict with the law; children living in alternative care; children with disabilities; children living in extreme poverty; children bullied in educational settings; children victims of all forms of abuse, especially sexual abuse; children with mental health difficulties; children who are married or living in cohabitation; pregnant teenagers and adolescent moth ers; infants; children of incarcerated mothers; children living in poor housing conditions; and children living in the Islands of Rodrigues and Agalega. I would like to invite all child rights activists to visit the OCO's website (oco.govmu.org) to better understand the situation of these children within our local context. A main specificity of the present Annual Report 2019 -2020 is that the issues discussed in the chapters 1 to 5 draw from recent happenings in the domain of children's rights locally. In c hapter 1, I firstly 1 SOS Children's Villages International (2016). Child at risk. The most vulnerable children: Who they are and why they are at risk. Retrieved on 10 September 2020 from 15 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children explain how the OCO made considerable efforts to uphold children's rights during the national confinement period due to the COVID -19 pandemic. The Council of Europe rightly pointed out, \"children may be confined, but their rights are no t!\" Working from home was a challenge for me and my team. Together with other staff members, I had to be on alert throughout the lockdown phase for any query or complaint regarding potential or actual violations of children's rights from any possible sourc e. I invested a lot of my time interacting with parents on the phone on different issues related to the well -being of their children. The confinement period also gave me a golden opportunity to listen and relate to children via social media. These interact ions inspired me to write two articles related to children's rights in the context of COVID -19, which were published in the press (refer to Appendices B and C). The lockdown was not an easy time for children living in residential care institutions (RCIs), and rehabilitation youth centres (RYCs). However, I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised on how most of them adapted to this novel situation. I was also impressed by how the staff of the RCIs and RYCs navigated the new challenges they faced. Earlier this year, I had planned to hold an important workshop on teenage pregnancy, but could not do so due to the lockdown. Instead, I held video calls with some adolescent girls who were affected by this issue. In chapter 2, I present three true stories on teenage pregnancy and adolescent motherhood. I also outline potential barriers in the prevention of teenage pregnancy, and possible strategies that can reduce its incidence or mitigate its adverse consequences on young people and their families. In order to d o so, I carried out desk research and in -depth conversations with three organisations actively involved in the field of adolescent sexual and reproductive health: Mauritius Family Planning and Welfare Association, Mouvement d'Aide \u00e0 la Maternit\u00e9 and Action Familiale . I also bring attention to a rights -based framework of sexuality education, known as Comprehensive Sexuality Education, which could be adapted and applied to our education system for students aged 5 to 18 years, including those with special educ ational needs and disabilities. Next, I focus on an under -reported and under -studied phenomenon that affect many children within conflictual family situations, namely parental alienation (PA). Many complaints involving the issue of PA were registered at the OCO over the reporting year 2019 -2020. In chapter 3, I explain this concept in more detail and analyse the impact of PA on the fundamental rights of children as enshrined in the General Introduction | 16 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children UNCRC. I also attempt to scope the potential extent of PA within the Republic of Mauritius and propose some recommendations regarding this matter. In the course of this year, cases of child abuse in R\u00e9sidence Anoska stirred debates on the local mechanisms in pl ace to respond to children in distress on the field. In chapter 4, I report on an initiative that the OCO carried out with the community members of R\u00e9sidence Anoska and child professionals involved in projects within this locality to improve their response in the protection of children. The core activity was a 2 -day networking forum with the aforementioned two stakeholder groups entitled, \"Strengthening the safety net to protect children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska from all forms of abuse through the dynamic partne rship between community members and child professionals\" . I describe in detail the preparatory actions that preceded this forum and the activities that comprised the forum itself. An important aspect of this forum was to stimulate the participants towards the objectives of this event, and mobilise and motivate both community members and child professionals to improve their interventions in the best interests of the children of this particular community. Following the 2 -day networking forum, I decided to ca rry out an in -depth investigation on the situation of children living in R\u00e9sidence Anoska , along with other activities promoting children's rights in this locality. The full support of the community leader and other members of this area greatly facilitated the task of the OCO. By next year, I intend to publish a Special Report on children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska. I think that this report will enable all stakeholders to not only assess the circumstances of the children of this locality, but also plan their inter ventions in a more scientific way based on qualitative and quantitative data. Last but not the least, I report on a vulnerable group of children whose rights are at risk in the context of homelessness (refer to chapter 5). Every child has a right to an adequate standard of living, which is enshrined in several human rights documents including the UNCRC. A main component of this right is to ensure that the child is living in an accommodation suitable to his/her safety and well -being. Children's right to adequate housing does not imply that the State has to build houses for the entire population. The onus on the State is mainly to take appropriate measures to prevent homelessness, address discrimination, focus on the most vulnerable and marginalised groups of people, ensure security of tenure to all, and guarantee that everyone's housing is adequate, by involving all the General Introduction | 17 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children necessary stakeholders from the public and private sectors. In my endeavour to protect the right of children to adequate housing, I have been engaging into meaningful dialogues with the Ministry of Housing and Land Use Planning, non -governmental organisations and members of the civil society. Chapter 5 provides an overview of activities and recommendations in the context of an own -motion investigation by the OCO on homeless children's right to adequate housing. As you may know, the UNCRC is the most widely ratified international human rights treaty, and noteworthy progress in the children's agenda has been achieved in the past thirty years. In the current report, I felt it was worth highlighting some interesting international and local good practices that are contributing to the implementation of the UNCRC (refer to chapter 8). However, impo rtant challenges remain, particularly in relation to children in disadvantaged and vulnerable circumstances and children with disabilities. To conclude, I hope that this report will help in driving changes in the lives of the most vulnerable groups of chil dren of the Republic of Mauritius. In any society, change starts with reflection. I wish that this document enables child rights activists and policy decision makers to reflect and act upon the analyses and recommendations made.

Introduction 1.1.1. Background The outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID -19) is still marking al l of us as the pandemic continues to spread and affect millions of people around the world . Its impact on our social and economic realities is palpable . While the international community is striving to find a vaccine against this virus, a global narrative on 'learning to live alongside COVID -19' is gradually emerging . Anyone can contract the COVID-19, including children. According to the World Health Organisation ( WHO, 2020 a)2, \"COVID -19 is often more severe in people who are older than 60 years or who have health conditions like lung or heart disease, diabetes or conditions that affect their i mmune system \". Nonetheless, i t is interesting to note that a systematic review of 131 studies , involving samples of children who had COVID -19 across 26 countries , found that most of the child patients display ed mainly mild symptoms such as fever and cough, or no symptoms at all (Hoang et al. , 2020)3. The impact of the pandemic on children's education, nutrition, safety and mental health cannot be discounted. As a rising number of countries enter lockdown situa tions to contain the spread of COVID - 19, the probabilities of domestic violence and abuse against children are likely to intensify. Stress related to the pandemic among parents or caregivers , such as uncertainties regarding their income or jobs, can increa se their likelihood to respond with aggression or violence towards the demands and need for attention of their children (Abramson, 2020)4. It also becomes more challenging for these adults to tap into their support networks , such as child care, wider fami ly relatives or community groups , to assist in catering for the socio -emotional needs of their children . This a dds to their anxieties and stress , and it can be more acutely so for vulnerable families who do not have access to technology. Besides , being confined and in close proximity with perpetrator(s) make it harder for children, victims or survivors to flee a violent situation, seek help from another person or contact the authorities.

School closures have impacted more than 1.5 billion c hildren and youth. Movement restrictions, loss of income, isolation, and overcrowding have heightened levels of stress and anxiety in parents, caregivers and children, and cut families and individuals off from their usual sources of support. Reports of chi ld abuse and of children witnessing violence between their parents and caregivers have increased. In the Republic of Mauritius, the Government declared nationwide confinement from 20 March 2020 in order to curb the local spread of the COVID -19. It issued a Curfew Order on 23 March 2020 which was renewed at intervals up to 30 May 2020. During that period, all schools remained closed and economic activities were stopped, with the exception of esse ntial services. Owing to having no reported cases of COVID -19, t he lockdown in the Islands of Rodrigues and Agalega had ended earlier on 15 April 2020 , and their schools had resumed on 4 May 2020 and 11 May 2020 respectively. In the Island of Mauritius, schools were reopened on 1 July 2020, albeit with conditions attached. With regards to domestic violence and child abuse in Mauritius, it was reported that, from 20 March 2020 to 13 May 2020, the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family Welfare (MGEFW; Government Information Service [GIS], 2020)6 registered 349 cases of domestic violence against women and 463 cases of child abuse . Over that same period, COVID -19 testing was carried out with 37 children before their placement into residential ca re institutions (GIS, 2020) . The Honourable Minister, Ms Kalpana Devi Koonjoo -Shah, assured that the MGEFW in collaboration with the Mauritius Police Force intervened in all reported cases , and that the necessary support and protection were provided to the victims (GIS, 2020). 5 World Health Organisation (2020b).

All of this is affecting children in multiple ways: Falling into poverty: An estimated 42 -66 million children could fall into extreme poverty as a result of the crisis this year, adding to the estimated 386 million children already in extreme poverty in 2019. Exacerbating the learning crisis: 188 countries have imposed country wide school closures, affecting more than 1.5 billion children and youth. The potential losses that may accrue in learning for today's young generation, and for the development of their human capital, are hard to fathom. More than two -thirds of countries h ave introduced a national distance learning platform, but among low -income countries the share is only 30 percent. Before this crisis, almost one third of the world's young people were already digitally excluded. Threats to child survival and health: Econ omic hardship experienced by families as a result of the global economic downturn could result in hundreds of thousands of additional child deaths in 2020, reversing the last 2 to 3 years of progress in reducing infant mortality within a single year. And t his alarming figure does not even take into account services disrupted due to the crisis - it only reflects the current relationship between economies and mortality, so is likely an under -estimate of the impact. Rising malnutrition is expected as 368.5 mil lion children across 143 countries who normally rely on school meals for a reliable source of daily nutrition must now look to other sources. The risks to child mental health and well being are also considerable. Refugee and internally displaced children a s well as those living in detention and situations of active conflict are especially vulnerable. Risks for child safety: Lockdowns and shelter in place measures come with heightened risk of children witnessing or suffering violence and abuse. Children in conflict settings, as well as those living in unsanitary and crowded conditions such as refugee and IDP settlements, are also at considerable risk. Children's reliance on online platforms for distance learning has also increased their risk of exposure to i nappropriate content and online predators.\" Source: United Nations (2020).

Retrieved on 25 August 2020 from www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/policy_brief_on_covid_impact_on_children_16_april_ 2020.pdf The United Nations (2020, pp.2 -3) stated that: The COVID -19 Confinement & Children's Rights | 24 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 1.1.2. The Ombudsperson for Children's Office in the context of the COVID -19 confinement Similar to other national human rights institutions, this unprecedented crisis set a new challenge to the Ombudsperso n for Children's Office (OCO) - how to continue upholding the rights and best interests of the children of the Republic of Mauritius within the limits imposed by the confinement? It was clear that it would be difficult to conduct field visits and face -to-face meetings for the purpose of investigations. However, as rightly advanced by the Council of Europe (2020)7, \"children may be confined, but their rights are not!\" . Committed to its mandate as defined by the Ombudsperson for Children Act (OCA) 2003, the Ombudsperson for Children (OC) was determined to \"ensure that the rights, needs and interests of children are given full consideration by public bodies, private author ities, individuals and association of individuals\" (OCA 2003, section 5(a)) , even during the confinement . In this context, t he OC and her team monitor ed within available means the situation of children's rights through different methods , including regular ly checking office email s and responding promptly to requests and queries; registering complaints on violations of children's rights through the phone or online encrypted platforms such as WhatsApp ; liaising with multiple authorities , such as the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family Welfare and the Brigade pour la Protection des Mineurs , to obtain or transmit relevant information regarding children's matters ; carrying out phone follow -ups and video calls with institutions where children reside such as residential care institutions ( RCIs ) and rehabilitation and correctional youth centres ; creating guidelines for RCIs on precautions during confinement to protect children's rights; monitoring publications related to children in the local media (online or p rinted); raising the awareness of the public on children's matters during the confinement through the media (radio, television and newspapers) ; and 7 Council of Europe (2020). Children may be confined, but their rights are not! Retrieved on 25 August 2020 from Rights | 25 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children keeping up -to-date with the latest publications related to COVID -19 of the Committee on the Rights of the Ch ild and other international organisations such as the WHO, especially regarding the impact of COVID -19 on children and their rights . The present chapter details the main actions carried out by the OC to safeguard the fundamental rights and best interests of children, especially those who were most vulnerable during the confinement such as children residing in institutions , children with disabilities , and children living in poverty and deplorable housi ng conditions. The first section focuses on activities conducted by the OCO to monitor and protect the right s of children during confinement. In the second section, some good practices that enabled the promotion of children's rights by some governmental au thorities and civil society organisations are highlighted. Finally, the OC provides a list of recommendations that could be considered to improve the fulfilment of the rights of children of our Republic during and after future lockdown situations. 1.2. Promoting children's rights during the COVID -19 confinement period During the confinement, the OC monitored the protection of children's rights in residential care institutions (RCIs) . She also ensured that young people residing at Rehabi litation Youth Centres (RYCs) were being treated according to the provisions of the UNCRC . In addition, s he partnered with the Delegation of the European Union to the Republic of Mauritius to launch a joint communiqu\u00e9 to sensitise the public on pro moting children's rights. Moreover, she engaged continuously with the media to raise awareness on the situation of children during the lockdown. The present section describes each of the above -mentioned initiatives. 1.2.1. A focus on children living in RCIs Child ren living in RCIs often have difficult family backgrounds and histor ies of trauma , which can make them more vulnerable to having mental health difficulties and displaying challenging behaviour s. Living in an institution away from their families with limit ed parental contact is already a hard reality for them. A long -term confinement period with movement restrictions can further exacerbate their frustrations The COVID -19 Confinement & Children's Rights | 26 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children and vulnerabilities. Moreover, the staff at the RCIs would also inevitably face more pressures and challenges in the management of the children's needs, moods and behaviours , and, they may consequently feel more strained and lacking in motivation. During the lockdown, the OC made it a priority to establish phone contacts with the Managers of RCIs to scope the extent of their difficulties and help them reflect on strategies that can best protect the rights of their residents. She noted that, overall, the RCIs were faring quite well in this novel situation and were doing whatever they could to establish sanitary measures and maintain a good enough level of activity among the children within their premises. The following sub -sections describes different activities carried out by the OC to support RCIs of the Republic of Mauritius in the promotion of the rights of their child residents. It also provides an overview of the voices of RCI Managers and children living in RCIs regarding their difficulties and achievements during the confinement. 1.2.1.1. Facilitating the issuance of COVID -19 Work Access Permit s for RCI Managers The COVID -19 Work Access Permits (WAP) were a requirement for all employees, especially those working in essential services, to be able to travel from home to th eir place of work , and vice versa, during the curfew period. RCIs are an essential service and employees who were directly involved in the care of the child residents had to attend duty on -site during confinement. Nevertheless, in the initial phase of the confinement, many RCI Managers were experiencing significant delays in being issued this permit by the authorities. The waiting period for the COVID -19 WAP led to several difficulties for some of them , including the following : (i) Some M anagers were having problems with catering for the basic necessities of the children, such as food, clothing and sanitary pads, as and when needed, due to movement restrictions without a COVID -19 WAP. (ii) Although work transport was being provided by RCIs to carers to travel from their homes to their places of work, some drivers and carers had been intercepted by the police . In some cases, t he police strictly warned them t hat it did not suffice to show their COVID -19 WAP application forms and this was recorded as a br each of the Curfew Order. These situation s caused inconvenience and distress among the concerned staff. The COVID -19 Confinement & Children's Rights | 27 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children (iii) Some carers were not prepared to bear the risk to come to work with the fear of contracting the virus or being caught by the police without a WAP. This caused short staffing situations in some RCIs, which affect ed the quality of child care. Many RCIs' Managers were worried about the impact of the long waiting time for a COVID -19 WAP on the rights of their child residents and they complained to the OC about it. The OC deemed imperative for staff of RCIs , at least the Managers, to obtain WAP s as soon as possible in order to ensure the proper running of care services for the child ren, in line with a rticles 3 (1) and 20 (1) of the UNCRC as quoted below: \"In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration .\" (UN, 1989, article 3(1)); and \"A child temporarily or permanently deprived of his or her family environment, or in whose own best interests cannot be allowed to remain in that environment, shall be entitled to special protection and assistance provided by the State .\" (UN, 1 989, article 20(1)) To facilitate the acquisition of COVID -19 WAPs for RCI Managers, the OC emailed a list of all the RCIs in Mauritius and the names of their respective Managers to the Commissioner of Police (CP). She requested him to fast -track COVID -19 WAP approvals for these Managers so that they could attend to the needs of the children under their care . The CP acceded to the OC's request and all the Managers were issued their WAPs within a short period of time . As for the WAPs of the other RCIs' empl oyees, their applications had to be submitted online by the ir respective Managers to be approved by the CP. In the end , all RCI s' employees managed to successfully obtain their WAPs and travel from and to their places of work without any difficulty. 1.2.1.2. Collaboration with the Commissioner of Prisons to provide food and masks to RCIs during the complete lockdown phase At the beginning of the lockdown, there was a period where ba keries were closed and pharmacies had very limited supplies of face masks. During this time, many RCI Managers informed the OC that they The COVID -19 Confinement & Children's Rights | 28 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children were daily trying to find alternatives to bread for feeding the child residents , and sometimes , due to the limited avai lability of other food items or ingredients, this proved to be challenging . They had also requested those employees who did not have face masks to try to sew their own mask or otherwise wear a scarf to cover their nose and mouth. In this context, t he OC t hought that at least a one -off distribution of bread and fabric face masks could provide some relief to child care and management within RCIs during the complete lockdown phase . She knew that the Mauritius Prison Service was executing a laudable job, where by its inmates were preparing food such as bread and cakes, and sewing fabric face masks, for distribution across prisons and vulnerable groups of people. She liaised with the Commissioner of Prisons who agreed to provide 700 breads and cakes, and 700 fabr ic masks for distribut ion across all RCIs of Mauritius. The Brigade pour la Protection des Mineurs collaborated with the OCO in the delivery of these parcels. 1.2.1.3. Circulation of a guideline entitled \"COVID -19: Pr\u00e9cautions pratiques pour les RCIs\" The rights to life, survival, development and health of children can be at stake during a pandemic. In view of strengthening the level of preparedness and response of RCIs to the threat of COVID -19 and safeguarding the aforementioned children's right s, the OC created and circulated a practical guideline on sanitary precautions that can be taken within RCIs' environments. The guideline was written in French language and is provided below: \"COVID -19 sur vos provisions. 2. Portez un masque et maintenez une distance de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 entre les livreurs et vous. 3.

The message was written in French language and is i llustrated as follows: Le 27 mars 2020 Bonjour \u00e0 tous, que votre se m\u00eame si l'heure est nous vivons des moments tr\u00e8s difficiles.

Je vous \u00e0 bien lire et mettre en pratique les consignes ci - ******* . Dans notre Venkatasawmy Ombudsperson for Children 1.2.1.5. Video calls to children and staff of RCIs The OC made video calls to children and staff of several RCIs to provide them with useful information on how to support one another during times of crisis and guidelines on protecting themselves from the virus. Some children openly expressed their apprehensions that the lockdown ha d restricted many of their rights . The OC empathised with them and encouraged all children to be vocal on their issues with trusted adults, and to contact her for any advice regarding their rights . She reminded them that they may be confined, but their rig hts are not. She requested children and carers to show courage and patience and to build an understanding of one another during this tough time . 1.2.1.6. Children displaying challenging behaviour at an RCI During the confinement period, the OC received a complaint from the Manager of an RCI regarding disturbances being created by some residents, which were affecting the operations of the RCI . The OC The COVID -19 Confinement & Children's Rights | 32 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children decided to conduct a surprise visit to the RCI and engaged the children in an open discussion. She carefully and respectfully listened to the ir concerns and view s. When she spoke with the children, they acknowledged that it was important to speak out their feeling s so that their carers could better understand their needs, rather than to behave in a c hallenging way. The OC was able to successfully resolve the situation . 1.2.1.7. Letter of motivation to RCIs When the extension of school closures until 1 July 2020 was announced, many children in RCIs were showing increased levels of agitation and challe nging behaviours due to boredom and their pressing need to go outside the RCIs' premises. Despite these difficulties, the RCIs were trying their best to occupy the time of the residents during this prolonged phase with educational and leisure activities. In this context, the OC addressed a letter of motivation (as provided below in French language ) to all RCIs to support them in their perseverance. Le 16 avril 2020 Bonjour \u00e0 tous, Je souhaite de tout l'Ombudsperson pour les enfants et cela nous a permis de renforcer nos liens de travail. con que chaque \u00ab shelter \u00bb s'adapte \u00e0 sa confinement s'appuie sur pour une t\u00e2che difficile et en ce moment cet encadrem ent est encore plus compliqu\u00e9.

Experiences shared by some RCIs on difficulties encountered and good measures taken during the confinement The lockdown period was undoubtedly full of challenges for RCIs . Nonetheless, the y also remarkably adapted to this novel situation through interesting solutions. The OC carried out a survey via email on the difficulties encountered and good measures implemented by RCIs during confinement. The responses from 6 RCIs8 who participated have been summarised in the following tables : 8 The names of the RCIs have been anonymised to avoid id entification of their children or staff members. de capacit\u00e9s organisationn elles, de maximiser l'importance ou plut\u00f4t sur l'urgence de la grand, plus la pas \u00e0 \u00e9viter \u00e0 vos enfants les de la vie, \u00e0 \u00bb Louis Pasteur, la microbiologie The COVID -19 Confinement & Children's Rights | 34 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 1. RCI 'A' Difficulties encountered : 1. Some caregivers encountered difficulties with their family members who did not approve of them coming to work on a 24 -hour basis. The family members thought that RCIs for children were not considered essential service s. 2. Being confined for a long period of time impacted on the children's behaviours . The peace of the RCI was disrupted by some older children who did not abide by the rules and regulations. 3. The residents had difficult ies to follow the distance learning courses on radio and television . The older girls tried their best to help the primary school -going children and some of our caregivers helped the older girls to do their homework. But, in general , we felt that such classes were very difficult for children in the RCI to follow fully. Good measures implemented : 1. Proper precautions and sanitary measures were taken , and constant communication through phone calls, Whats App and emails helped management to take right decisions. No visitors got access inside the RCI to avoid imported infections . Regular briefing sessions were held with caregivers . 2. The e ducation of residents w as ensured . Those who attend primary schools, special needs school and secondary schools did their revision s and homework using their school text books. They also followed the Ministry of Education 's daily scheduled program for each grade. They could also choose books to read from the RCI's library. 3. Social skills were promoted and the children were encouraged to clean their rooms . The elder girls gave a helping hand to the caregiver s in the daily chores. 4. Various entertaining activities such as story-telling , reading , drawing , painting, singing and role play were organised with the children . Moreover, indoor recreational activities such as monopoly, scrabble, dominoes and card games were organised more often. The COVID -19 Confinement & Children's Rights | 35 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 2. RCI 'B' Difficult y encountered : 1. The RCI faced difficulties regarding the Work Access Permit. Among 19 staffs, only 15 were granted their permits. In this context, the driver was stopped twice by the police for breach of the Curfew Order. Administration called upon the Ombudsperson for Children for assistance. Good measures implemented : 1. Only authorized person s were allowed to enter the RCI, for example, CDU Officers, Police Officers, Hygiene Company Workers and the RCI's staff following clear sanitary conditions . They used hand sanitizers, wore masks and disinfect ed their shoes before their entry. 2. Good hygiene practices were observed carefully at the RCI to c ontrol the spread of the virus. 3. The girls were updated about the evolution of the COVID -19 virus and the impact of this on their daily routine through regular counselling sessions. Our attached p sychologist conducted a weekly video call session with the residents. 4. Activities were proposed to the residents to engage their imagination and avoid boredom caused by the confinement. These included gardening, recycling of resource materials, cooking sessions, meditation and physical exercise. 5. Regarding their e ducation , the girls were following the educational programme on television under the supervision of caregivers . In addition, they were encouraged to do revision and group work. The COVID -19 Confinement & Children's Rights | 36 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 3. RCI 'C' Difficulties encountered: 1. At the beginning of confinement, the children were excited about this new situation which they thought was like school holidays. However, when they understood that they would not be going to school or on outings for a long period of time and that they were not allowed to leave the RCIs' premises, many of them felt increasingly bored and anxious. They also missed their school friends. 2. At times, some of the children displayed temper tantrums, anger, physical and verbal aggression, defiance to rules and regulations, and oppositional behaviours among others. Good measures implemented: 1. During confinement, individualised online learning support was organised for children who are doing the Primary School Achievement Certificate (PSAC). The other children followed lessons delivered through television and the radio. 2. Although a basic routine was established with the children, residents were given the flexibility to choose among a variety of activities to occupy their tim e (e.g. watching television, indoor and outdoor games and activities, self -learning, self -care and relaxation, dance, listening to music, supervised cooking , etc.) 3. Children were regularly informed in a simple and child -friendly manner on the COVID -19 situa tion. They were also taught sanitary skills such as regular hand washing and social distancing. They also expressed themselves regarding the COVID -19 situation through drawings. 4. The residents received therapeutic and psychological support during confinemen t as and when required. The COVID -19 Confinement & Children's Rights | 37 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 4. RCI 'D' Difficulties encountered: 1. Each unit in the RCI has children of different a ge group s. Even if arrangements were made so that each age group could have their time scheduled for online classes, problems happened when specific channels were not available in certain units . For college students, they d id not have access to mobile phones or computers, so difficulties ar ose when their classes and homework were being sent via WhatsApp . 2. The confinement period accentuated the behavioural challenges of some youths. It was quite difficult to maintain a certain stability and discipline in the adolescents' workshops. Good measures implemented: 1. Proper sanitary measures we re taken to prevent the spread of the virus . 2. Caregivers worked up to the 15th of May on a 7 -day rotational basis for each team. This allowed less movement of caregivers in the RCI's premises to prevent contamination of the children and the caregivers them selves. Once confinement was partially lifted , transport arrangements were made to pick up and drop caregivers at their house to prevent use of public transport. 3. In view of ensuring psychosocial and pedagogical support to caregivers and children, the pedag ogical team, including the internal psychologist and senior social worker , resided onsite during confinement. 4. Daily workshops were organised with different age group s of children on self - presentation, self - esteem, life after residential care , integration processes and professional projects. Pre - adolescents and adolescents worked in groups during these workshops. These sessions allowed them to express their feelings about the lockdown experience. The COVID -19 Confinement & Children's Rights | 38 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 5. RCI 'E' Difficulties encountered: 1. It was not easy to purchase food and other items (such as washing machine liquid) due to conditions set by the Government to go to the supermarkets. Items were limited at the RCI and several purchasing trips had to be made in difficult conditions. The RCI had to rely on buying food items from nearby shops, which costed more than supermarket items . Good measures implemented: 1. The confinement was strictly followed for the protection of the children. No visitors were allowed in. Transport was provided for the c onveyance of staff from their residence to their place of work and back in the RCI's transport. 2. All residents and staff abided by g ood hygiene rules. The basic essentials of the children were ensured. The health of residents and staff was monitored. 3. The RCI also followed the \"COVID -19: Pr\u00e9cautions pratiques pour les RCIs\" sent by the Ombudsperson for Children's Office as a guidance to ensure that proper sanitary measures were put in place to avoid the spread of the virus among children and caregivers. 4. Regular exercises were organised with the children to maintain their physical and mental health. The COVID -19 Confinement & Children's Rights | 39 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 6. RCI 'F' Difficulties encountered: 1. The difficulties we had encountered were mainly to provide our beneficiaries with personal protective equipment (PPE). Good measures implemented: 1. The RCI established the necessary sanitary measures to ensure the safety of the children. The children were sensitised on the virus and on how to prevent the spread of the virus. The residents were also informed on the necessary precautions to be taken to avoid a second wave. 2. The RCI developed a new Post -COVID -19 working procedure with the participation of all staff and some children, which had the following sp ecific objectives: i. To ensure that the beneficiaries have food during the post -confinement period; ii. To develop family gardens and egg production for vulnerable families; and iii. To monitor and evaluate this project on a regular basis. 1.2.1. 9. The voices of children living in RCIs during the confinement Article 12(1) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (UN, 1989) stipulates that \" States Parties shall assure to the child who is capable of forming his or her own views the right to express tho se views freely in all matters affecting the child, the views of the child being given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child\" . The OC valued hearing from children during the confinement and she received numerous messages and lette rs from children residing in RCIs regarding their feelings and experiences during this pandemic. Some of their comments in Mauritian Creole language are quoted below: Child E.C. (11 COVID -19 Confinement & Children's Rights | 40 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Child C.D.

Promoting children 's rights in Rehabilitation Youth Centres (RYCs) during confinement Similar to interventions with RCIs , the OC monitored the situation of inmates living in the RYCs to ensure that their rights were being protected during confinement . The OC regularly contacted the Officers -in- charge of the RYCs to take stock of any problems related to the inmates. She also animated a video conferencing session with the residents, especially regarding their right to health during this pandemic, and listened with great attention to their views and concerns. She gave useful advice and guidance to the inmates and staff regarding their rights and responsibilities as per the Convention on the Rights of the Child (UN, 1989). During the confinement, I was truly impressed by how the staff and children of RCIs and RYCs navigated the new challenges they faced. Their resilience was commendable. Managers and caregivers working at these institutions courageously left the safety of their homes to fulfil their duti es in the care of these vulnerable children and young people. I was amazed on how they kept going, despite the health risks and amplified responsibilities of managing the needs, anxieties, moods and behaviours of their inmates. Understandably, it was not an easy time for these children and the lockdown seemed to have exacerbated their difficult feelings. They are already living a life separated from their families, and the lockdown additionally prohibited them from meeting their friends, or going to their favourite leisure places. Nonetheless, I was pleasantly surprised on how most of them adapted to this novel situation and engaged their creativity and imagination in making sense of their experiences. ~ R.

Joint communiqu\u00e9 of the OCO and the European Union (EU) The OCO partners with the Delegation of the EU to the Republic of Mauritius on a number of initiatives to protect the rights of vulnerable children of our country. In the context of the coronavirus disease crisis, the OCO and the EU issued a joint communiqu\u00e9, as given below, which called on families to engage their children in recreational activities, and also to protect them from the heightened risk of violence, exploitation and abuse as part of the broader response to COVID -19.

Raising awareness on children's situation and rights through the media during confinement The OC had been regularly solicited by the media during the confinement period to obtain her statements and views on various children's matters including the murder of a 10 -year -old girl by her parents and the misuse of the internet as a means of abuse among young people . Besides, s he also wrote two articles that were inspired from positive and difficult experiences that children and their families shared with her over the confinement period. The first article was published in the newspaper Le Mauricien on 20 April 2020 (refer to Appendix B). It looked at some of the challenges that the confinement created for children, including those with disabilities, and their families . It also drew attention to the importance of recognising the vulnerabilities of children and not cons idering them as 'small adults'. The second article was published in the newspaper L'Express on 08 May 2020 (refer to Appendix C ), in which the OC provided a brief overview of the COVID -19 situation in relation to children's rights. She then proposed some m ethods on how we could lean on the lessons of this global pandemic to enhance the creativity, understanding of values and character -building of children and young people in Mauritius. 1.3. Good practices by different stakeholders that promoted children's rights during confinement During the COVID -19 national lockdown , several governmental bodies and civil society organisations set up innovative ideas to mitigate the effects of the pandemic . These actions contributed to fulfilling the rights of our children, mainly their rights to education, health, protection from all forms of violence , information and freedom of expression. The OC extends her appreciation to all the stakeholders who merged their efforts in this purpose. E xamples of good practices by some of these stakeholders are briefly presented in the following sub -sections. The COVID -19 Confinement & Children's Rights | 45 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 1.3.1. Maintaining the continuity of education and student learning during confinement In order to uphold the right to education of the children of our country during the lockdown period , the Ministry of Education, Tertiary Education, Science a nd Technology (METEST), in collaboration with the Mauritius Institute of Education (MIE) , the Open University of Mauritius, the Mahatma Gandhi Institute and teachers, launched media -based lessons from Grades 1 to 9 on 06 April 2020. These lessons were broa dcasted by the Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation on four channels from Monday to Friday . In addition, Grade 9 students also had access to the Student Support Portal of the METEST. For students of Grade s 10-13, two electronic platforms were used , namely Zo om and Microsoft 365 , for teachers to conduct online classes and upload lessons. The MIE also catered for pre -primary school learners and students with special education needs. These educational arrangements were further formalised and enacted through the COV ID-19 (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020 on 16 May 2020. This law provides for the implementation of distance education during temporary closure of educational institutions as well as make s provision for staff members of educational institu tions to produce and conduct distance education and online learning programmes, including broadcast lessons. Other requirements under this law include social and physical distancing in educational institutions to be applied as a result of infectious diseas es occurring in epidemic forms; and the maintenance of a register containing the contact details of school staff, of Managers of secondary schools and of the responsible parties for students, to be used for the purpose of distance education and online lear ning. On 4 June 2020, the Honourable Minister of Finance, Economic Planning and Development announced in the Budget Speech 2020 -21 that some 2,570 tablets would be distributed to students of Grades 10 to 13 for families listed on the existing Social Register of Mauritius . 1.3.2. Ongoing essential services of the Child Development Unit Every child has the right to be protected from all forms of violence. In the Republic of Mauritius, the Child Development Unit (CDU) of the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family Welfare is the responsible authority that provides protection services to children victims of violence, abuse and neglect on a 24 /7 basis. As explained in the background of the current chapter, lockdown situations are known to increase The COVID -19 Confinement & Children's Rights | 46 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children the risks of domestic violence and abuse against children. Despite its shortage of staff, the CDU has remained operational during the confinement to handle r eported cases of child abuse and provide the appropriate assistance and support services to victims and their family members. 1.3.3. Health care and essential services for all Healthcare workers and other essential service providers have been on the front line in the fight against the spread of the coronavirus disease. They put themselves at risk and valiantly spared no effort s to ensure the protection of adults and children. In a national press briefing on COVID -19, it was announced that, as at 2 April 2020, eight children aged 4 months, and 2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 12 and 15 years respectively had been confirmed positive to the virus. To date, no death of minors due to COVID -19 has been reported in the Republic of Mauritius . To contain the spread of the disease and to screen as many potential cases as possible, the Ministry of Health and Wellness established the following good practices: Mauritians were advised not to visit hospitals for minor issues. Alternatively , volunteer Mauritian doctors set up a consultation service online named \"medicine.mu\" to give free medical opinions and advice to anyone in the public. The Ministry provided a hotline service (8924 ) that was available on a 24/7 basis to answer the public's queries on COVID -19. The Officers of the Ministry carried out a meticulous process of contact tracing and conducted COVI D-19 testing with as many citizens who have been in contact with a contaminated patient or who were suspected to carry the virus. 1.3.4. The Brigade pour la Protection des Mineurs assisting vulnerable children and young people The hard work of the police force during the confinement in maintaining order an d discipline among citizens to prevent the spread of the virus and in supporting vulnerable families , including children, was laudable . The Brigade pour la Protection des Mineurs (BPM) , which is the police unit specialised in the The COVID -19 Confinement & Children's Rights | 47 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children protection of children, was also active on the field during the lockdown and initiated several good practices with children and families, for example: A good level of communication with vulnerable children and their pare nts was maintained. The BPM continued to sensitise families and communities on their role as a child -friendly police unit during their field visits. Requests or case referrals from the CDU, the OCO, NGOs and members of the public were promptly attended to. Targeted patrols were organised to safeguard the rights of children living in at -risk regions to protect them from violence, abuse and exploitation. Children in shelters were regularly visited and provided with appropriate information to minimize the risk of rebellion and damage to property. 1.3.5. A mobile app to raise the awareness of the public on a safer Mauritius The Ministry of Information Technology, Communication and Innovation and the Ministry of Health and Wellness collaborated on the creation of a mobile application called \"beSafeMoris\" . This app could be easily used by both children and adults who had access to a smart phone or tablet to obtain the latest updates on the number of COVID -19 cases in the country, communiqu\u00e9 by different Ministries and sanitary measures to be taken to prevent the proliferation of the coronavirus disease. 1.3.6. Free Online Holistic Counselling Forum The Free Online Holistic Counselling Forum was an initiative by the Rotary Club of Goodlands that regrouped professionals (e.g. medical practitioners, psychologists, psychiatrists, counsellors, coaches , etc.) from Mauritius and a broad to help people cope with the drastic shift caused by COVID -19 in their daily lives. The main goal of this online forum was to provide emotional support and holistic counselling to adults in distress and those who were having difficulties to manage th eir children during the pandemic. The professionals aimed at providing coping strategies to support adults' mental health , family life and career development, among others. Providing a platform that can help people, especially The COVID -19 Confinement & Children's Rights | 48 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children parents, to resolve their iss ues and provide better care to their children, contributes to the implementation of the UNCRC. 1.3.7. The media and their informative role during the pandemic Media and digital technologies are playing a crucial role in the global fight against the COVID -19 pandemic. In our country, the Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation (MBC), online medias, the written press as well as private radios have extensively informed adults and children on the evolution of COVID - 19 locally and internationally and on the ne cessary precautions to take to protect oneself from contamination. The MBC also promoted the expression of children and young people on their experiences during the lockdown. Every night, it broadcasted their drawings, pictures and videos portraying messag es of hope on COVID -19 in a segment after the news show. This was a significant way of valuing the views and voices of children on a global situation that concerned each and everyone of them. 1.4. Recommendations 1.4.1. Recommendations from the Committee on the Rights of the Child The Committee on the Rights of the Child (2020)9 enlisted 11 recommendations that can contribute to minimis e the significant physical, emotional and psychological effects that the COVID -19 pandemic may have on children and young people. These have been outlined below. 1. Consider the health, social, educational, economic and recreational impacts of the pandemic on the rights of the child. 2. Explore alternative and creative solutions for children to enjoy their rights to rest, leisure, recreation and cultural and artistic activities. 9 Committee on the Rights of the Child (2020 ). The Committee on the Rights of the Child warns of the grave physical, emotional and psychological effect of the COVID -19 pandemic on children and calls on State s to protect the rights of children .

Ensure that online learning does not exacerbate existing inequalities or replace student -teacher interaction. 4. Activate immediate measures to ensure that children are fed nutritious food during the period of emergency, disaster or lockdown . 5. Maintain the provision of basic services for children including healthcare, water, sanitation and birth registration. 6. Define core child protection services as essential and ensure that they remain functioning a nd available, including home visits when necessary, and provide professional mental health services for children living in lockdown. 7. Protect children whose vulnerability is further increased by the exceptional circumstances caused by the pandemic (e.g. children with disabilities; children living in poverty; children in street situations; children with underlying health conditions including HIV/AIDS; children deprived of their liberty or confined in police lock -up facilities, prisons, secure care ce ntres, migrant detention centres or camps; and children living in institutions). 8. Release children in all forms of detention, whenever possible, and provide children who cannot be released with the means to maintain regular contact with their families. 9. Prevent the arrest or detention of children for violating State guidance and directives relating to COVID -19, and ensure that any child who was arrested or detained is immediately returned to his or her family. 10. Disseminate accurate information about COVID -19 and how to prevent infection in languages and formats that are child -friendly and accessible to all children including children with disabilities, migrant children and children with limited access to the Internet. 11. Provide opportunities for children's vi ews to be heard and taken into account in decision -making processes on the pandemic. The COVID -19 Confinement & Children's Rights | 50 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 1.4.2. The OC 's recommendations regarding protection of children's rights in future lockdown situations The authorities and the civil society have displayed considerabl e commitment towards protecting children during the pandemic . Additionally, in the eventuality of future national lockdown situations, the OC would like to recommend measures that could be considered to better protect and promote the best interests and rights of children : 1.4.2.1. Sensitising the public on preventing violence against children Given the likely rise of violence within family settings during a lockdown situation, it is necessary that the population is sensitised on this issue and made aware of how they need to act in such cases. This could be done by continuously providing extensi ve information to the public through the emergency hotline of the CDU and information platforms on radio, television and social media . 1.4.2.2. A specialised platform for parental guidance During a lockdown situation, it can be stressful for parents and c aregivers to find ways to manage their children's time. An electronic platform such as a mobile application could be designed to provide tips and advice to parents /caregivers on activities and games that they could do with their children at home and in the ir yards using simple techniques and available means. This c ould bring variety to their home routine, prevent their children from getting bored or frustrated and enable quality and fun parent /caregiver -child time. 1.4.2.3. Equity in distance education and online learning of children Distance education and online learning are crucial in the continuity of students' education during a lockdown. In order to ensure that all students can access this form of education without any discrimination, it i s important for stakeholders to assess whether students have the required IT device and internet facility at their homes. In cases where students neither have such equipment nor the means to purchase them, State assistance should be provided to facilitate their right to education. Moreover, it is crucial to consider adaptations to the content and delivery of distance education to make it more accessible to children with disabilities and special educational needs. The COVID -19 Confinement & Children's Rights | 51 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 1.4.2.4. Parental controls on children's in ternet usage During confinement, children spend a lot of time on the internet for distance education and online learning, leisure purposes and communication with friends and relatives. Nonetheless, this also increases the risk of them being exposed to inap propriate web content, sexually explicit material and online predators. The relevant authorities and technology experts could sensitise parents on how to ensure their children's online safety and monitor their internet usage. 1.4.2.5. Safeguarding the rig hts of children in care institutions and rehabilitation or detention centres Children living in institutions deserve special attention during the confinement. It is important to prevent their rights from being violated , especially with respect to their rig hts to quality care, education and health. They must be guaranteed adequate nutrition, educational continuity and access to leisure activities within the premises. Psychological interventions, either face -to-face or through video/voice calls, must be provi ded on a regular basis to the children. In cases of new referrals to institutions during a pandemic situation , the authorities must ensure that the children are safe from any infectious disease before placing them with the other residents. They must also relay a maximum of background information on the child to the Managers of these institutions so that they can better plan the child's care and rehabilitation. If any child resident seems to be displaying symptoms of an infectious disease during a pandemic, he/she must be isolated from the rest of the group until he/she is tested negative for the virus by health pr ofessionals . If children living in institutions needed to be quarantined during a pandemic, special support and protection have to be made available to them within quarantine locations. 1.4.2.6. Special consideration to the needs of pregnant teenagers an d adolescent mothers Pregnant teenager s and adolescent mothers often tend to be a hidden population of young people, who are not always known to services or consistent in their appointments with hospitals . A pandemic situation can further exacerbate these avoidance behaviours to the detriment of their health and that of their unborn or newborn child. This vulnerable group of girls must be sensitised on prenatal and The COVID -19 Confinement & Children's Rights | 52 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children postnatal care and given the necessary support with childbirth , especially during a pandemic . For known cases of teenage pregnancy, home visits from doctors could also be facilitated during a lockdown . 1.4.2.7. Multi -stakeholder collaboration in the protection of children's rights Governmental bodies and civil society organisations could unite th eir strategies during a lockdown situation to create and maintain safe environments for all children. This could prevent unnecessary duplication of work and improve the efficiency and networking of stakeholders in fulfilling children's rights according to the UNCRC to the maximum extent possible . 1.4.2.8. Reinforcing risk management for children and their families The Republic of Mauritius has experienced for the first time a long -term lockdown situation due to a global pandemic . After this confinement, it is necessary to learn from unanticipated challenges that children and their families faced , and identify and mitigate r isk factors that make them more vulnerabl e to health risks and rights violations during a pandemic. Examples are homelessness, unsafe housing, food insecurity , parental substance abuse and mental health difficulties, and poverty , among others. 1.4.2.9. Evaluating the impact of COVID -19 on childr en National quantitative and qualitative research on the impact of COVID -19 on several areas relevant to children , such as their physical and mental health, their education al achievement , their relationships with their parents or their social networks , and their exposure to violence, are warranted . Such studies could provide valuable data that c ould inform policy decisions regarding the needs of children during a lockdown . 1.4.2.10. From online learning to school resumption Transitioning from a confinement period, where students had to adapt to a new way of learning online or through the media, to resuming school with strict sanitary and social distancing conditions can be a difficult phase for children. Some children might e xperience different kinds of anxieties such as separation anxiety, anxieties related to illness, loss or financial hardship within their families, germ - related phobias or distress on having fallen behind in their studies. It is important that these childre n The COVID -19 Confinement & Children's Rights | 53 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children are supported by Educational Psychologists or Counsellors at school to make sense of these changes and alleviate their anxieties and stress. The school management must also continuously provide clear and concise information to students regarding modifica tions in their school curriculums, new examination dates and sanitary norms within school premises. 1.4.2.11. The COVID -19 pandemic as a springboard for value -based education The OC believes that the COVID -19 pandemic can act as a springboard for children and young people to be educated beyond their books and learn pedagogically active skills that can reinforce their understanding of values and empower them to become engaged actors in social transformation. In order to facilitate this process, the OC propo sed in her article provided in Appendix C examples of five active pedagogical methods that could be used by educators with students - story -telling; film/video viewing with interactive discussions ; quality debates with secondary school students ; performing arts as a vehicle for value -based learning; and developing an eco -friendly mentality among students. 1.5. Conclusion The Republic of Mauritius has achieved a full deconfinement since 31 May 2020 although its borders are undergoing a phased reopening subj ect to the global context in relation to COVID -19. Our country has demonstrated resilience and commitment in stopping the spread of the virus within the local population. All stakeholders including the authorities, parastatal bodies, non -governmental organisations, the media and the public have contributed to this achievement. Hand washing or sanitising, mask wearing and social distancing are now daily behaviours adopted b y our citizens at workplaces, schools, supermarkets and other public settings as a means of preventing a second wave of the coronavirus disease. Within a context of national vulnerability during a global pandemic , it is even more crucial to attend to the needs of vulnerable people, and those of at-risk children must be a topmost priority for any State. To conclude with the impactful words of Michelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, spoken at the 'Stop the War on Children' Symposium at the Hague on 16 May 2019, The COVID -19 Confinement & Children's Rights | 54 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children \"Without strong commitment to children, we undermine not only the destiny of many individuals - but also our community's strength. Protecting children's rights and wellbeing should be absolutely basic to who we are. All children possess inherent worth and should have an equal chance to thrive, whatever their social origin, gender, place of birth or family situation. [...] Because if we do not take a stand for children's rights, who are we and what has happened to our humani ty and values? Because if we don't act now, when?\" ~ Michelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights The COVID -19 Confinement & Children's Rights | 55 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 CHAPTER 2 Furthering the Conversation on How to Reduce and Prevent Teenage Pregnancy Teenage Pregnancy | 56 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Teenage Pregnancy | 57 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 2.1. Introduction According to the World Health Organisation (WHO; 2020a)10, \"at least 10 million unintended pregnancies occur each year among adolescent girls aged 15 -19 years in the developing world\". Adolescent mothers aged 10 -19 years have higher risks of c hild birth complications and infections than mothers aged 20 -24 years, and babies of adolescent mothers face more elevated risks of low birth weight, premature birth and severe newborn conditions (WHO, 2020a). The adolescent fertility rate, which refers to the number of births per 1,000 women aged 15 -19 years (WHO, 2020b)11, varies across countries. The global average adolescent fertility rate was recorded at 42 births per 1,000 in the year 2018 (The World Bank Group [TWBG], 2020)12. The table below provide s the adolescent fertility rates for the year 2018 in some countries of the world, including Mauritius (TWBG, 2020): Country Adolescent fertility rate for the year 2018 (births per 1,000 women aged 15 -19) France 5 United Kingdom 13 United States 19 Mauritius 25 Botswana 45 Seychelles 61 South Africa 68 Niger 184 According to Statistics Mauritius (2019)13, a total of 1,153 births were recorded among young women aged 15 -19 years and those under 15 years in the year 2018.

Digest of demographic statistics 2018. Mauritius: Ministry of Finance and Economic Development . Teenage Pregnancy | 58 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children pregnancy remains a challenge to adolescent health and development. There is a general perception among local organisations working with pregnant teenagers that the situation is worsening on the field and that a rising number of adolescents of younger ages are falling pregnant. In 2018, 29 births occurred to mothers under the age of 15 years (Ministry of Health and Wellness, 2019)14. Stories of teenage pregnancies are often flagged up by the media and the first half of the year 2020 bore several exampl es that made headlines, such as the case of a 17 -year -old girl and her 14 -year -old boyfriend expecting a baby in February 2020; the case of a 14 -year -old girl who was 7 -month pregnant of a man of 20 years of age in March 2020; and the situation of a 12 -year -old girl giving birth in May 2020. In the Annual Report 2017/2018 of the Ombudsperson for Children's Office (OCO; 2018)15, an overview of some international and local provisions regarding teenage pregnancy and adolescent parenthood was presented. T he Ombudsperson for Children (OC) had also launched in 2018 a Press Communiqu\u00e9 to invite citizens of the Republic of Mauritius to share their views on issues such as teenage pregnancy, child marriage, teen dating and cohabitation between either two minors or an adult and a minor. Over a period of 10 days, more than 110 people including children, adults, statutory and civil society organisations had responded16. They provided interesting views on matters such as the national definition of the child, the mini mum age of marriage in our country, and the effects of pregnancy and early marriage on adolescents, among others. It is noteworthy that the Ministry of Gender Equality, Child Development and Family Welfare (2019, section 2)17 has proposed a revised definit ion of the child as \"a person under the age of 18\" in the upcoming Children's Bill, instead of the Child Protection Act 1994's version of \"any unmarried person under the age of 18\" . 14 Ministry of Health and Wellness (2019).

Children born to adolescent mothers are also at risk of their fundamental rights being violated such as not being registered a t birth and not having a decent home or adequate nutrition. They are also often identified by the authorities as children in need of protection and they might be removed from the care of their teenage mother. This separation can have further negative reper cussions on the health and well -being of these children who might be institutionalised from an early stage in their lives. This year, the OCO aimed at better understanding potential barriers in the prevention of teenage pregnancy, and possible strategies that can reduce its incidence or mitigate its adverse consequences on young people and their families. For this purpose, the OC and her team carried out desk research and organised in -depth discussions with three local organisations actively working in the domain of adolescen t sexual and reproductive health, namely, the Mauritius Family Planning and Welfare Association (MFPWA), the 'Mouvement d'Aide \u00e0 la Maternit\u00e9' (MAM) and 'Action Familiale' (AF). In the following sub -sections, the stories on teenage pregnancy and adolescen t motherhood of 3 young girls who contacted the OC are firstly presented. Secondly, information and reflections that emerged from the desk research by the OCO and meetings with MFPWA, MAM and AF are described.

THIS YEAR , THE OCO AIMED AT BETTER UNDERSTANDING POTENTIAL BARRIERS IN THE PREVENTION OF TEENAGE PREGNANCY , AND POSSIBLE STRATEGI ES THAT CAN REDUCE AND MITIGATE ITS ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES ON YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES . Teenage Pregnancy | 60 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children \"Dear Madam Rita, I am writing to you this letter because you told us to \"be free to contact you about our concerns\". Thanks for sensitising us on child sexual abuse. I am an intelligent student and I would love to become a doctor one day. I am 16, I have a baby, and I was not sexually abused. I loved my boyfriend very much. When we had sex, he t old me I was safe because he had taken all precautions. He said that I was not going to be pregnant. I trusted him, but 3 months later I found that I was pregnant. When I informed him, he said that I must have had another boyfriend! I was helpless. I begge d for his love and support, but he did not want to believe me. I decided to talk to my parents. Both were very kind and supportive. Until now, they are still with me and my baby girl. My teachers also have stood by my side, but I no longer go to school. I still dream to become a doctor. My ex -boyfriend has disappeared and I hate him. I will make sure that my child also hates him.\" appraised. The chapter ends with a list of recommendations proposed by the O CO that can contribute to reducing or preventing teenage pregnancy in the Republic of Mauritius. 2.2. Stories of three young girls on their pregnancy and motherhood 2.2.1. A letter to the OC from a 16 -year-old mother The letter below was sent to the Ombudsperson for Children by a 16 -year -old adolescent girl who wished to relate her experiences of pregnancy and motherhood. Teenage Pregnancy | 61 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 2.2.2. Raped and pregnant at 15 years old and holding on the hope for a better life Five years ago, this then 15 -year old girl, named Sasha20, became pregnant after being raped by an 'uncle'. She was an orphan who lost both her parents in a ca r accident at the age of 6 years old and had been living with her grandmother since then. When she informed her grandmother of the rape, the latter blamed it on her saying that it was due to her wearing shorts. She was devastated and in pain, but one of he r aunts decided to take care of her. The aunt brought her to the police station two days after the incident. Overwhelmed with anxiety, Sasha could not utter a word to the police. She said that she could not remember anything. She only recalled that she cou ld not walk properly and that she felt terrified and miserable. When the Child Development Unit interviewed her, she could not find the proper words to explain what had happened to her. For the past five years, her grandmother taunted her every day for hav ing accused an innocent man and blamed her for having given birth to an illegitimate child. She had stopped attending school after giving birth. There were instances over this period where the same 'uncle' tried to engage her in sexual activities. Sasha i s now 20 years old. She informed the OC that she is working as a maid in a wealthy family who supports her a lot. She is also in a serious relationship with her boyfriend whom she will marry in a few weeks. She expressed her relief that she would no longer be living at her grandmother's house and tolerate her continuous accusations and rebukes. She told the OC that she was hopeful that her life would get better. She affirmed that the rape would not define the rest of her life and she has a right to be happy . 2.2.3. The OC recounts a phone call from a distressed mother and her 13 -year-old pregnant teenager It was 6 o'clock in the morning and my phone was ringing. I was not fully awake, but the first thought I had was that it could be an emergency call from someone. I checked the phone's screen. It was an 20 This is a fictitious name to protect the identity of the person. SHE AFFIRMED THAT THE RAPE WOULD NOT DEFINE THE REST OF HER LIFE AND SHE HAS THE RIGHT TO BE HAPPY . Teenage Pregnancy | 62 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children OC: \"Good morning, how are [There was a long silent pause.] OC: \"Your mother just called me. She is really worried about you.\" [After a few long minutes, the daughter decided to answer.] Daughter: \"Ms Rita, I don't know how I got pregnant. I don't even think I am pregnant. We did it only on one occasion, Ms Rita. Just once! My friend told me that it takes several times to get pregnant.\" OC: \"Sorry, what did your friend tell you?\" Daughter: \"My friend told me very clearly that I could have sex with my boyfriend without getting pregnant. I have a big round belly, but in no case does it imply that I am pregnant. My mother is worried for no reason.\" unknown number. Nonetheless, I answered the call. At t he other end of the line, I heard the voice of a woman crying profusely and struggling to utter her words. She sobbed for the next ten minutes and I gauged that something painful had happened to her. Meanwhile, I reassured the lady that I was here to liste n to what she had to say and help her wherever possible. When she started regaining her composure, she managed to tell me that her 13 -year -old daughter was pregnant. \"Madam Rita, I have given her the best education. How could she betray my trust, the trust of her dedicated mother?\" , said the lady to me in a state of shock and denial. I acknowledged her concerns and was able to calm her down so that she could express herself more clearly. She added that her daughter refused to give her any explanation and t hat the latter remained withdrawn and silent. She requested me to speak with her daughter on the phone. The conversation went as follows: Teenage Pregnancy | 63 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children It was clear that the girl did not have any sexuality education. She was not aware that the law prohibits sexual intercourse before the age of 16 years, that her 17 -year -old boyfriend was liable to a legally arrestable offence, and that unprotected sex cou ld lead to a pregnancy. I encouraged her to cooperate with her mother so that she could get herself tested. The girl's belly continued to grow and her menses had stopped. Her mother brought her for a pregnancy test which turned out to be positive. The girl 's boyfriend who was 17 years old denied that he was the father. He did not want to hear about the girl and claimed that he was busy in his studies. The mother lodged a case at the locality's police station. Her daughter was receiving psychological support and guidance from the Child Development Unit and the Brigade pour la Protection des Mineurs . 2.3. Summary of reflections from desk research and discussions on teenage pregnancy 2.3.1. About MFPWA, MAM and AF Within the scope of work of the MFPWA, MAM and AF, all three organisations educate and support pregnant teenagers and their families on their rights and health. For instance, two of the functions of the MFPWA is to advise on population education and sex education, and to provide marriage counselling. As for MAM, it conducts sessions in schools and villages with both boys and girls on the theme \"Pran Letan pou Kontan\", with the aims to speak about sexuality in a healthy and positive way, to encourage responsible sexual behaviour, and to provide informat ion on problems entailed by early pregnancies and risks and diseases associated with irresponsible sexual behaviour. It also encourages parents to have an open dialogue regarding sexuality with their children. Regarding AF, one of its main intervention are as is sexuality education, which it views as integral to the holistic development of young people. For information, a brief outline on the mission and main activities of each of these organisations are provided in Appendix D. 2.3.2. Statistics from MFPWA In the year 2019, the MFPWA registered at its drop -in centre 309 new cases of teenage pregnancy, and 91 new cases from January to June 202021. With regards to abortion among pregnant teenagers, this 21 The numbers provided by the MFPWA represent only those adolescents who approach their services. Teenage Pregnancy | 64 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children organisation recorded 5 cases in the year 2018, 4 c ases in the year 2019 and 2 cases from January to June 2020. The MFPWA pointed out that there is a significant lack of data regarding abortion among adolescents in Mauritius. It is important to note that abortion is illegal in Mauritius, with the exception of four special circumstances according to section 235A (2) of the Criminal Code (Amendment) Act 2012 as stated below: The specialist (...) may only provide treatment to terminate a pregnancy where another specialist in obstetrics and gynaecology and another specialist in the relevant field share his opinion, formed in good faith, that \u2014 (a) the continued pregnancy will endan ger the pregnant person's life; (b) the termination is necessary to prevent grave permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant person; (c) there is a substantial risk that the continued pregnancy will result in a severe malformation, or sever e physical or mental abnormality, of the foetus which will affect its viability and compatibility with life; or (d) the pregnancy has not exceeded its fourteenth week and results from a case of rape, sexual intercourse with a female under the age of 16 or sexu al intercourse with a specified person which has been reported to the police. In the period 2013/2014, the MFPWA conducted a survey on teenage pregnancy with a sample of 100 teenage mothers aged 13 -18 years (Soobron -Dubarry & Bhagan, 2014)22. The mothers were interviewed on different questions related to their family circumstances, education, employment, relationship status, support systems, attitudes towards their pregnancy and abortion, and awareness of contraceptive methods, amongst others. Some of the results and conclusions of the survey are summarised as follows: 22 Soobron -Dubarry, S. & Bhagan, K. (2014). Report on survey on teen age pregnancy. Mauritius: MFPWA. Teenage Pregnancy | 65 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children SOME RESULTS REPORTED IN THE SURVEY OF MFPWA (Soobron -Dubarry & Bhagan, 2014) Teenage mothers' education: 94 per cent of the teenage mothers had left school. 67 per cent of them did not receive any sexuality education. Teenage mothers' onset of sexual activity: 38 per cent of the mothers had their first sexual intercourse at the age of 14 years. Teenage mothers' attitudes on learning about their pregnancy and on abortion: 45 per c ent of these mothers were shocked and depressed on learning that they were pregnant. 77 per cent of the participants did not think of having an abortion after learning about their pregnancies. Reactions of teenage mothers' parents: All the teenage mother s reported that their parents had negative reactions on learning about their pregnancy. 6 per cent of the interviewees reported that they were thrown out of the home by their parents on learning about their pregnancy. Teenage mothers' partners: 71 per cent of the teenage mothers had partners aged above 20 years. 37 per cent of the mothers were single and had no support from their partners. Teenage mothers' knowledge and use of contraception: 88 per cent of the teenage mothers reported being aware of a t least one form of contraceptive method. 47 per cent of them claimed that they did not think of using any contraceptive method during sexual intercourse, and 27 per cent of the mothers stated that their partners did not want to use any method of contracep tion. Teenage Pregnancy | 66 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children SOME CONCLUSIONS IN THE SURVEY OF MFPWA (Soobron -Dubarry & Bhagan, 2014) (1) It was found that the main causal factors of teenage pregnancy were domestic violence, parental separation, alcohol/substance abuse, absence of the father and lack of communication within the family setting. (2) Girls whose fathers left them at an early age had a higher rate of early sexual activity resulting in teenage pregnancy. (3) The age of first sexual intercourse of a majority of the adolescents had a peak at the ages 14 to 15 years. (4) More than one third of the teenage mothers were single mothers. (5) Some adolescents lack knowledge of, or access to, conventional methods of preventing pregnancy, as they may be too embarrassed or frightened to seek such information and ser vices. (6) Adolescents lacking in sexuality education are twice more vulnerable of engaging in early sexual activities. (7) Adolescents with low educational background can be another risk factor for early sexual activity. 2.3.3. General points noted on the is sue of teenage pregnancy 2.3.3.1. Teenage pregnancy and poverty Research evidence shows that there is a correlation between poverty or low -income levels and higher adolescent fertility rates, especially in developing countries (e.g. Oke, 2010)23. Poverty can act both as 23 Oke, Y. F. (2010). Poverty and Teenage Pregnancy: The dynamics in developing countries. OIDA International Journal of Sustainable Development , 2(5), 63 -66. Teenage Pregnancy | 67 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children a cause and consequence to teenage pregnancy, thus reinforcing a cycle of disadvantage among pregnant teenagers and adolescent parents. These adolescents are more likely to leave education early, which then reduces their opportuni ties to build a career and find a well -remunerated job. At times, engaging in sexual relationships might become a means for adolescent girls living in poverty to receiving gifts or monetary benefits from adult men. Local organisations working with pregnant young women also report that many pregnant teenagers come from low -income families living in deprived regions of the country. 2.3.3.2. Teenage pregnancy and at -risk families It is a global reality, as advanced by the Committee on the Rights of the Child (2003, para.11)24,that, \"[w]hile most adolescents grow up in well -functioning family environments, for some the family does not constitute a safe and supportive milieu\" . Family environmental factors such as child abuse and neglect, domestic violence and pa rental substance abuse among others can greatly affect children's physical and psychological well -being, and teenage pregnancy could be a result of sexual abuse. Some adolescents may attribute having sex to feeling valued and special, and early sexual acti vity may lead to intended or unintended pregnancies. Similarly, it was reported in a study conducted by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF; 2018)25 in Guyana, South America, on pregnant teenagers that \"some of the adolescents were from homes where they felt unloved and were consciously and unconsciously seeking love outside of the home and ended up in sexual relationships with men who they felt were showing them love and attention\" . Moreover, a longitudinal study on adolescent sexual behaviour found that children who were exposed early to instability in their parents' relationships were more likely to report sexual partnerships by the age of 16 years old (Donahue et al. , 2011)26. 24 Committee on the Rights of the Child (2003).

Teenage Pregnancy | 68 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 2.3.3.3. Health risks related to teenage pregnancy Teenage pregnancy can result in detrimental consequences on the sexual and reproductive health of adolescent girls, as well as their mental health. Based on their experience of working with pregnant teenagers and adolescent mothers, the MFPWA, MAM and AF shared th eir views on this area, as follows: The adolescent's body is not fully developed for pregnancies. Early onset of sexuality may increase the risks for teenagers to contract a sexually transmitted disease such as HIV and syphilis. Such conditions can largel y limit the opportunities of young people in life and may lead to significant mental health difficulties like anxiety and depression. When teenagers are victim of incest, this may result in consanguine pregnancies which have high risks of foetal malformati ons. Most teenagers give birth by Caesarian delivery due to being too young and unprepared for normal delivery, and this may have lasting effects on their bodies and mental health. Teenage mothers may have difficulties to conceive or other reproductive iss ues when they become adults. 2.3.4. Points raised on potential barriers to preventing teenage pregnancy 2.3.4.1. A lack of open parent -child dialogue on sexuality Owing to the taboo associated with sexuality locally, m any parents do not consider that thei r children might be sexually active and they show reticence towards talking with them about it. It could be inferred that, when they were adolescents, it might be possible that their own parents did not have such conversations with them. Some parents belie ve that sex education should not be taught at school from a young age because 'it is inappropriate ' and 'it will encourage their children to become sexually active'. 2.3.4.2. Fear of disrepute in the family In the case of a teenage pregnancy, some familie s might try to hide the adolescent girls' pregnancy from the authorities and the society and, in most cases, these young people stop attending school. They Teenage Pregnancy | 69 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children fear that such news might bring disgrace to their families' reputation and destroy the young person' s future. In some instances, the pregnant teenagers might be forced to enter into a formal or informal union with the prospective father, who could be either a minor himself or an adult. Within some extreme cases, the pregnant teenagers might be put throug h an abortion using unsafe procedures, also known as a backstreet abortion, increasing the risks of maternal medical complications or even deaths. These cases would not come to the attention of the authorities unless the teenager is brought to the hospital , and the Child Development Unit and the Police are informed. Hazardous practices to end a teenage pregnancy could cause long -term and adverse effects on the physical, psychological, emotional and social well -being of the concerned teenagers. 2.3.4.3. Sexuality education is not only about the biological aspects Sometimes, people confound secondary school biology lessons on reproduction with sexuality education. However, the biological aspect of sex is only one part of sexuality education among several other components such as decision -making about one's body, consent, gender equality, responsible sexual behaviour and sexually transmitted diseases, among others. Sexuality education should not be merely an academic subject that is delivered throug h a text -book approach. Furthermore, it is observed that academic staff are not necessarily skilled and best placed to educate students on their sexuality. 2.3.4.4. Unreliable sources of information on sexuality With their growing curiosity during the pub ertal period, often young people feel embarrassed to ask questions regarding sexuality directly to their parents or teachers and they resort to other sources of information, mainly the internet. Some internet material can be unreliable or pornographic in n ature and, could have an adverse impact on the sexual and mental health of the young people. Some adolescents rather believe in what their older siblings or peers tell them regarding sexuality. They may even experience peer pressure to engage in sexual int ercourse, usually as a way to 'fit in' or 'look trendy'. It is not surprising to hear pregnant teenage girls who come into contact with services saying that they were not fully aware that having unprotected sex may lead to pregnancy and entail undesirable Teenage Pregnancy | 70 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children consequences on their lives. They did not know that the age for sexual consent in Mauritius is 16 years and, that infringing this provision can lead to arrestable offences, as stated below: \"Any person who has sexual intercourse with a minor under the ag e of 16 or a mentally handicapped person, even with his consent, shall be liable to penal servitude for a term not exceeding 10 years\" . (Criminal Code Act 1838, section 49(4)); and \"Any person who causes, incites or allows any child to (a) be sexually abu sed by him or by another person, (b) have access to a brothel, (c) engage in sexual prostitution, shall commit an offence\" . (Child Protection Act 1994, section 14(1)). 2.3.4.5. Fear of being judged regarding contraception Young people are often not inform ed enough about the local free health services available regarding contraception and express a fear of being judged or stigmatised by health professionals or their parents if they come into contact with these services. Adolescents who are aged 16 and 17 ne ed parental consent to acquire contraceptive methods from these services, and this might hinder them from disclosing sexual activity to their parents. Consequently, adolescents tend to refrain from accessing contraceptive services. Regarding the issue of t eenage pregnancy, it was advanced in the 2014 Contraceptive Prevalence Survey (Republic of Mauritius, 2016, p.4)27 that Inadequate counseling on contraceptive methods results in improper use of these methods which inevitably leads to teenage pregnancy. Th e inaccessibility and unavailability of these methods further contribute in the occurrence of unprotected sexual activity. Sometimes even when family planning services are freely accessible many young and unmarried people do not take full advantages of the se services mainly because of social and cultural barriers. This national survey (Republic of Mauritius, 2016) included a representative sample of 255 female teenagers aged between 15 and 19 years old and 94 per cent of them reported that they had knowled ge 27 Republic of Mauritius (2016).

However, this knowledge alone cannot guarantee that the teenagers understand fully how to use these contraceptive methods or that they actually use them. 2.3.4.6. A lack of local research on teenage pregnan cy There is insufficient quantitative and qualitative research in the country on teenage pregnancy. This may create difficulties in developing targeted policies for pregnant teenagers and adolescent mothers because information will be based on statistics a vailable to authorities and civil society organisations that have not necessarily been obtained and evaluated through rigorous, evidence -based and systematic research methods. 2.3.5. Points advanced on possible strategies to prevent teenage pregnancy 2.3.5.1. The need for parents to talk about sexuality with their children Parents need to be sensitised on their primordial role in the sexual development of their children and in having age -appropriate open conversations on sexuality with their children. This cannot be the sole responsibility of the education system. Parents need to understand that sexuality education is a way of preparing their children to making important decisions about their body, relationships and life in general. They indee d have the responsibility to validate the content of this type of education, be prepared to accompany their children in learning about their sexuality and be empathetically responsive to their questions. 2.3.5.2. Creating a safe space for learning about s exuality Puberty can be a n insecure and anxiety -provoking period for young people whose bodies and mental states are undergoing rapid developmental changes. Adolescents must be supported through this phase of their lives by educating them on these changes, helping them manage their anxieties and allowing them space and time to express their feelings. It is important that sexuality education is conducted by qualified, knowledgeable and experienced individuals who would use a value -neutral, non-judgmental and contextualised approach to allow students to safely explore their questions and reflections regarding this matter. This can be a form of empowerment in that students can learn to Teenage Pregnancy | 72 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children relate and respect one another and understand that their anxieties are norma l and shared among many of them. In addition, building the emotional intelligence of young people is paramount within sexuality education to enable them to become more in charge of their emotions relative to their bodily changes and to their decisions rega rding their sexual behaviours. 2.3.5.3. Improved communication on and access to contraceptive methods There is a need to ensure that young people have adequate and user -friendly information on contraception, and sufficient access to contraceptive services . The 2014 Contraceptive Prevalence Survey (Republic of Mauritius, 2016, p.156) recommended \"more accessibility to contraception and explanation about usage in youth centres and youth counselling centre\" . Additionally, the Committee on the Elimination of D iscrimination Against Women (CEDAW; 2006, para.31)28 urged our State to \"step up the provision of family planning information and services to women and girls, in particular regarding reproductive health and affordable contraceptive methods, and to promote widely sex education targeted at girls and boys, with special attention to the prevention of teenage pregnancy\" . Communication strategies to inform young people about their sexual and reproductive health can be adapted and modernised through techno logical means to reach and impact a maximum number of young people. 2.4. A rights -based framework of sexuality education 2.4.1. Background In a global context where information on the Internet and other forms of media are readily accessible to young peop le, it is becoming increasingly difficult to protect them from exposing themselves to sexually explicit content, which can affect the way they understand and express their sexuality. The importance of educating and equipping adolescents with the necessary knowledge and skills to make responsible choices on their bodies, relationships and life cannot be undermined. Evidence -based and effectively -delivered sexuality education can improve outcomes for young people with regards to their 28 Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women ( 2006 ). Concluding Comments, Mauritius . Geneva: United Nations. Retrieved on 17 August 2020 from www.refworld.org/docid/453778492.html . Teenage Pregnancy | 73 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children sexual behaviours. One s uch example is a rights -based sexuality education framework known as Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE; UNESCO, 2018)29. 2.4.2. About CSE By definition, CSE is a \"curriculum -based process of teaching and learning about the cognitive, emotional, physi cal and social aspects of sexuality. It aims to equip children and young people with knowledge, skills, attitudes and values that will empower them to: realize their health, well -being and dignity; develop respectful social and sexual relationships; consid er how their choices affect their own well-being and that of others; and, understand and ensure the protection of their rights throughout their lives\" (UNESCO, 2018, p.16). This approach to sexuality education is in line with the Convention on the Rights o f the Child (United Nations, 1989)30 with respect to several articles, including the child's rights to life, survival and development (article 6); having their views heard and taken into account (article 12); freedom of expression (article 13); access information from the media (article 17); health and health services (article 24); quality education (articles 28 and 29); and be protected from sexual abuse and exploitation (article 34). It also contributes mainly to two targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3 (good health and well -being) and 5 (gender equality), as specified below: SDG target 3.7: \"By 2030, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health -care services, including for family planning, information and educati on, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes\" ; and 29 UNESCO (Rev. edn.)

Teenage Pregnancy | 74 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Excerpt from the International Technical Guidance on Sexuality Education (UNESCO, 2018, p.36) SDG target 5.6: \"Ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights as agreed in accordance with the Programme of Action of the Inte rnational Conference on Population and Development31 and the Beijing Platform for Action32 and the outcome documents of their review conferences\" . 31 The Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development can be accessed on the website link www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/event -pdf/PoA_en.pdf . 32 The Beijing Platfor m for Action can be accessed on www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/pdf/BDPfA%20E.pdf . Teenage Pregnancy | 75 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children The 8 core concepts covered by CSE are provided in the excerpt shown on the previous page, taken from the International Technical Guidance on Sexuality Education (UNESCO, 2018, p.36). It can be noted that CSE covers a wide range of issues that di rectly or indirectly concern youth sexuality. This framework does not limit itself to biological aspects of sex and sexuality, but also integrates the influence of values, emotions, culture and gender equality on adolescent sexual health and development. P sychological aspects such as body image, peer influence and help -seeking are also addressed with young people. CSE has been implemented in various developed and developing countries as it was designed to be globally applicable and easy to adapt to differ ent contexts. It can be delivered in both in -school and out-of-school settings. Acquisition of the knowledge and skills of the CSE is staged across four age - groups, that are, 5 -8 years, 9 -12 years, 12 -15 years and 15 -18+ years (UNESCO, 2018), and the learn ing objectives are matched to the cognitive and maturity levels of the students. The content can also be adapted to suit the needs of students with learning disabilities. The content of sexuality education is as important as the way it is delivered to you ng people. Innovative pedagogical approaches and trained educators can allow students to engage better with the content and apply what they learn in their daily lives. A review on high -quality studies regarding CSE (Montgomery & Knerr, 2016, p.14)33 noted that its delivery was more effective when lectures and information sessions at school were enhanced through other modes such as \"role plays, quizzes or competitions, skills -based sessions (such as correct condom use), condom provision, drama or songs, 'information kiosk', anonymous question box, printed materials, festivals and group work\" . In addition, a study by Pound and colleagues (as cited in Montgomery & Knerr; 2016, p.29) also came up with a list of characteristics that young people preferred in sex educators, which included: \"Knowledgeable; Has expertise in sexual health; Professional; Specifically trained in [sex and relationship education]; 33 Montgomery, P. & Knerr, W. (2016). Review of the Evidence on Sexuality Education. Report to inform the update of the UNESCO International Technical Guidance on Sexualit y Education . Paris: UNESCO. Teenage Pregnancy | 76 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Confident, unembarrassed, straightforward, approachable and unshockable, experienced at talking about sex, uses everyday language; Trustworthy, able to keep information confidential; Has experiential knowledge, comfortable with own sexuality; Good at working with young people; Able to relate to and accept young people's sexual activity; Respectful of young people and their autonomy, treats them as equals; and Has similar values to youth, provides balanced view, non -judgmental\". This review (Montgomery & Knerr, 2016) revealed that CSE programmes implemented across different countries cont ributed to delaying the onset of sexual intercourse and reducing its frequency among adolescents, decreasing the number of sexual partners of teenagers, diminishing risk -taking and irresponsible sexual behaviours, and increasing the use of contraception, m ainly condoms . CSE was found to be more impactful when it displayed sensitivity to gender issues; was school -based along with the involvement of parents, teachers, health professionals and other youth -related services; and promoted more choices to young pe ople including abstinence from or delaying sexual activity and contraception. Moreover, this paper (Montgomery & Knerr, 2016) challenged the misconception that sexuality education increases sexual activity among young people. It rather substantiated that t his awareness led to more responsible sexual attitudes and behaviours among adolescents. Although sexuality education is a necessary step in promoting the sexual and reproductive health of adolescents, it cannot on its own prevent teenage pregnancy which is a complex and multi -layered phenomenon. A holistic and multi -stakeholder approach that could address various risk factors of teenage pregnancy such as poverty, promiscuity, family -related problems, social and cultural pressures and child sexual abuse wo uld be more effective. Youth's access to sexual health and counselling services must also be encouraged and facilitated by the State and civil society organisations. Teenage Pregnancy | 77 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 2.5. OCO's recommendations on teenage pregnancy prevention 2.5.1. Scoping the extent of teenage pregnancy and adolescent parenthood locally It is important to gauge the extent of teenage pregnancy and adolescent parenthood cases across the Republic of Mauritius to be better able to prepare and implement relevant national policies and action plans effectively. Stakeholders such as the Ministry of Health and Wellness and local NGOs working with pregnant teenagers and adolescent mothers such as MFPWA, MAM and AF could combine their records into a centralised database so that all necessary informa tion on these targets groups could be derived from a single source. This database can have the advantage of accounting for harder -to-reach cases that are often more easily detected by NGOs than through formal mechanisms. This platform could be steered by a multi -stakeholder national committee with governmental, non -governmental and private sector representatives designed to prepare comprehensive interventions for these vulnerable adolescents, to track their progress and to monitor the local situation and na tional trends on teenage pregnancy and adolescent parenthood. 2.5.2. Rigorous local research is warranted More in -depth, rigorous and longitudinal local studies on topics such as the causes and long -term effects of teenage pregnancy and adolescent parenth ood, the effectiveness of sensitisation programmes with pregnant teenagers and adolescent mothers, or the experiences of these adolescents regarding their pregnancy or motherhood, among others, are warranted. The outcome of these studies can provide furthe r quantitative and qualitative information on these target groups and improve the design of national prevention and response strategies in these areas. 2.5.3. Making Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) compulsory in the country CSE, as described in su b-section 2.4.2 of the present document, could be contextualised and implemented in all primary and secondary schools of the Republic of Mauritius. Along with sex Teenage Pregnancy | 78 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children The Committee on the Rights of the Child (2003, para. 27) emphasises the need to educate adolescent girls on the risks of early marriage and pregnancy: Adolescent girls should have access to information on the harm that early marriage and early pregnancy can cause, and those who become pregnant should have access to health services that are sensitive to their rights and particular needs. States parties should take measures to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality in adolescent girls, particularly caused by early pregnancy and unsafe abortion practices, and to support adolescent parents. Young mothers, especially where support is l acking, may be prone to depression and anxiety, compromising their ability to care for their child. The Committee urges States parties (a) to develop and implement programmes that provide access to sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning, contraception and safe abortion services where abortion is not against the law, adequate and comprehensive obstetric care and counselling; (b) to foster positive and supportive attitudes towards adolescent parenthood for their mothers and fathers ; and (c) to develop policies that will allow adolescent mothers to continue their education . educators, parents and other relevant stakeholders such as health professionals could become active partners in the execution of the CSE curriculum and support educational outcomes for the young people at home and in community settings. This multi -stakeholder collaboration in youth sexuality education can improve the frequency and quality of paren t-child dialogues on this topic and challenge myths and taboos on the sexual and reproductive rights of young people. 2.5.4. Improving the youth -friendliness of sexual and reproductive health services Young people need to feel reassured that services made available to them regarding their sexual and reproductive health needs are attentive to their concerns and ensure their privacy and confidentiality. There is no doubt that, in cases of minors under the age of sexual consent (i.e. 16 years), authorities have to inform parents on the illegality of their young person's sexual activity and take the necessary Teenage Pregnancy | 79 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children follow -up actions. Adolescents of 16 and 17 years of age are still minors, but allowed by local law to engage in consensual sexual activity with partners of 16 years and above. It is important that health or other services working with 16 - and 17 -year -olds deal sensitively with them regarding their sexual needs and access to contraception, and empower th em with accurate information to build their capacity to make responsible decisions on sexual relationships. 2.5.5. Addressing risk factors of teenage pregnancy Research has shown that factors such as living in poverty or low -income households and being ex posed or victim of family instability (refer to sub -sections 2. 3.3.1 and 2. 3.3.2 of the current chapter) can increase the risks of early onset of sexual activity and teenage pregnancy. It is important that all relevant stakeholders ensure that such factors are being addressed and families supported to mitigate adverse consequences for young people. The Committee on the Rights of the Child (2003, para.12 (a & b)) emphasised the need to empower parents in supporting their adolescents' rights as follows: The Committee calls upon States parties to develop and implement, in a manner consistent with adolescents' evolving capacities, legislation, policies and programmes to promote the health and development of adolescents by (a) providing parents (or legal gu ardians) with appropriate assistance through the development of institutions, facilities and services that adequately support the well -being of adolescents, including, when needed, the provision of material assistance and support with regard to nutrition, clothing and housing (art. 27 (3)); (b) providing adequate information and parental support to facilitate the development of a relationship of trust and confidence in which issues regarding, for example, sexuality and sexual behaviour and risky lifestyles can be openly discussed and acceptable solutions found that respect the adolescent's rights (art. 27 (3)). Teenage Pregnancy | 80 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 2.5.6. Other relevant recommendations extracted from the OCO's Annual Report 2017/2018 Child marriage is not an option: It is unacceptable to coer ce a child into marriage as a way to 'resolve' a teenage pregnancy situation. This mentality has to be challenged within the society through awareness campaigns, dissemination of research evidence and appropriate law reforms. Many adolescents are not prepa red to live as a couple or to take up parental responsibilities. This may also result into the newborns facing difficult beginnings such as maltreatment or being removed from their parent's care. Compulsory education for all until the age of 16: Teenage p regnancy is often linked to high dropout rates from school. Teenage mothers attain low educational level which inevitably impacts on the socio -economic aspect of their family. It must be ensured that the right to education of pregnant girls and adolescent mothers under 16 years old are promoted and these young people should be supported to attend school as far as possible until the age of 16. Schools should be sensitised to become more compassionate and accepting environments for these young girls. By fear of 'bad influence' or 'disrepute', some schools might become a source of discrimination by not allowing these girls to come to school or sending them home due to their pregnancy. When resuming school following child birth, the concerned authorities and sch ool communities should work together to enable the mothers to fulfil their right to education along with upholding the rights of their newborn to good nutrition (e.g. through breastfeeding), love and care among others.

Introduction Why would a child express rejection towards one of his/her parents? Explanations might vary across theories and family and cultural contexts. Some examples of manifest situations that might lead a child to having a reje cting attitude towards a parent could be an intense conflict between a child and a parent, a parent failing to understand his/her child's feelings and needs, developmentally normal defiant reactions of a pre -adolescent or adolescent towards a parent, or ev en a child being victim of abuse by a parent (Lund, 1995)35. Nonetheless, there exist less obvious but damaging forms of parental rejection, and one such phenomenon is known as parental alienation (PA) . The latter commonly involves one parent psychological ly and emotionally manipulating the child to show resentment, hostility, unwarranted fear or contempt mainly towards the other parent and/or the grandparent(s). It is widely acknowledged that a child needs both parental figures for his/her proper developm ent. Each parent plays crucial and unique roles in the child's physical, psychological, emotional and social growth. Irrespective of their relationship status, both the father and the mother have a responsibility to put the best interests of their child (ren) first. Article 18(1) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (UN, 1989)36 on 'parental responsibilities' states that States Parties shall use their best efforts to ensure recognition of the principle that both parents have common responsibilities for the upbringing and development of the child. Parents or, as the case may be, legal guardians, have the primary responsibility for the upbringing and development of the child. The best interests of the child will be their basic concern. However, in cir cumstances where there is conflict between the parents or if they are separated or divorced, children often tend to suffer the most. In many of these cases, children may be subject to PA by a manipulative parent . Since PA goes against the core principles of the UNCRC and involves emotional abuse by one parent which is detrimental to the health and development of the child, it can 35 Lund, M. (1995).

Parental Alienation | 86 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children be considered as a form of child maltreatment37. Awareness -raising on the nature and effects of PA on children is growing internationally. S ince 2006, about 30 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Finland and South Africa, have signed up to educate the ir citizens on the impact of parental alienation on children and f amilies through the Parental Alienation Awareness Day celebrated on 25 April each year (For the children, n.d.)38. In addition , as proclaimed by the U nited Nations General Assembly in 2012, the Global Day of Parents is celebrated every year on the first of June (UN, n.d.)39 to appreciate the important roles of parents and to reflect on the challenges of parenting worldwide , including PA. In the current chapter, the concept of PA is first explained in more details. An analysis of how PA impacts on the fundamental rights of children is then presented. Next, an attempt is made to scope the potential extent of PA in the Republic of Mauritius. Finally, some recommendations with regards to raising awareness on PA locally are proposed. 3.2. Understanding th e concept of parental alienation 3.2.1. The theory behind The theory of parental alienation (PA) was first introduced by Dr. Richard Gardner, a child psychiatrist who specialised in child psychotherapy, parental matters and child custody evaluation . Gardne r (2002)40 coined the term \"Parental Alienation Syndrome\" after having conducted several studies and work ed extensively with families over 25 years. However, even if there is some controversy around the term \"Parental Alienation Syndrome\" because it is not listed as a formally recognised mental health 37 \"Child maltreatment is the abuse and neglect that occurs to children under 18 years of age. It includes all types of physical and/or emotional ill -treatment, sexual abuse, neglect, negligence and commercial or other exploitation, which results in actual or potential harm to the child's health, survival, development or dignity in the context of a relationship of responsibility, trust or power \".

As illustrated and described in the diagram below, a parental alienation scenario usually involves three main actors - the alienator or alienating parent , the alienated parent and the child who has been programmed (Healthline, 2019)41. In PA situations, often the parent who has the primary responsibility of the child withhold s the latter physically and/or emotionally from the other parent without any justification. PA can be unintentional or intentional , but the child is always caught in the middle. For instance, a parent may unknowing ly affect a child's view s of the other parent by speaking negatively about the latter and his/her family, by sharing details of the divorce with the child, or by pressurising the child to choose between him/her or 41 Healthline (2019).

When PA is intentional, the child , most of the time, undergoes systematic brainwashing and manipulation by the alienating parent whose main purpose is to destroy the relationship they once shared with the other parent (EachOther, 2019)43. The child is ma de to believe that the ir relationship with the alienated parent is detrimental and harmful . As a result, the child may refuse any contact with that parent. T he child may also show signs of disrespect, resentment, aggression, hostility and even unwarranted fear towards the latter (Hammond, 2018)44. In many cases, the alienation extends to the alienated parent's family , including grandparents, and friends . There is a general und erstanding that PA may occur in three different degrees (Heitler, 201945; PsychLaw, 201846): Mild PA: The child has contact with the alienated parent and criticism against the latter from the alienat ing parent is subtle. When , in the company of the aliena ted parent, the child can still enjoy the relationship. Moderate PA: The child is reluctant and show s resistance to meet or spend time with the alienated parent. This happens mostly because the alienator paints a negative picture of the alienated parent. Severe PA: The child rejects any contact with the alienated parent. The alienator has brainwashed and manipulated the child in such a way that the child has a very bad opinion of the other parent. Furthermore, Hammond (2018) drew attention to child -induc ed alienation (CIA), which may resemble PA, but actually is not. In CIA, the child consciously chooses to avoid contact or bonding with a par ent because he/she might have been victim or witness of neglect, traumatic events, abandonment or 42 Vacca, A. (2018).

Nevertheless, t here are some situations where a child might still want a relationship with an abusive parent , and the other parent prevents this from happening as a way to protect the child from any further harm. 3.2.2. Parental alienation: Common strategies used by the alienator As mentioned in the sub -section 3.2.1, the alienator can use differe nt strategies to foster a child's rejection of the other parent and four common ones are explained below, though this list is not exhaustive: 1. The alienator acts like a victim. The alienator tries to make the child take sides and become loyal to hi m/her by: o disclos ing unnecessary details of the divorce or separation to the child, for examples, affairs or aspects of the divorce which only concern the adults; o blam ing the alienated parent for the sep aration or divorce; o constantly criticis ing the alienated parent through attacking his/her lifestyle or character; o blam ing the targeted parent for financial problems; o mak ing the child think that the other parent does not love him/her; and o mak ing the child f eel guilty for loving the other parent or wanting to spend time with him/her. 2. The alienator limits the child's contact with the other parent. The alienator devise s ways for the child to spend l imited time with the alienated parent , such as by: o not allowing the child to see or talk to the other parent while telling the child that the latter is either busy or uninterested in him/her; o leading the child to believe that visits with the other parent as ordered by the Court are optional in cases of divorce; o frequently bending or breaking custody guidelines arranged inside or outside of Court; Parental Alienation | 90 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children o insisting that their underaged child, who cannot form or express his/her own views, does not want to go to the other parent's house, even if there is a Court Or der; o planning alluring activities that coincide with the other parent's visitation time s so that the child would not want to go with the alienated parent ; o not allowing the child to move freely between both parents' households ; o not allowing the child to spe ak freely or express their love for the other parent ; and o exerting control on the child's interactions with the other parent (e.g. confiscating the child's phones or other communication devices). In doing so persistently , the alienator eventually aims to e liminate the other parent from the life of the child. 3. The alienator excludes the other parent from the child's important life decisions and events. The alienator ensure s that the alienated parent is excluded from important information, decision - making p rocess es, key events and milestones regarding the child , by, for instance, deliberately: o not disclosing or sharing details with the other parent regarding the child's medical records, planned activities, educational activities, parent -teacher meetings, re port cards or developmental milestone s; and o not involving the alienated parent in major decisions involving the child , such as a change in school. 4. The alienator spies on the child's communication with the other parent and extracts information that can be used against him/her. The alienator monitor s communications between the alienated parent and the child to get information that he/she could use to portray the other parent in a negative light in the eyes of the child. He/she may even influence the chil d to extract specific information from the other parent. Some examples are: disrupting the alienated parent -child communication by manipulating a child's feelings or bribing them against the other parent ; Parental Alienation | 91 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children encourag ing the child to ask the alienated parent inappropriate questions so that the alienator may learn about the other parent's activities; and listening in during phone conversations between the alienated parent and the child and reading letters , emails and text messages sent to the child by the other parent. 3.2.3. Behavioural indicators of parental alienation in children Dr Gardner (1998)47 proposed eight symptoms or behavioural indicators, as described below, that a child can manifest when he/she is subject to parental alienation (PA), and these were validated by Baker and Damall (2008)48 with a sample of 68 parents who reported to be sever ely alienated by their ex - spouses from their children: 1. A campaign of denigration The child does not acknowledge that he/she once had positive experiences with the alienated parent. The love and affection which the child used to feel for the alienated pa rent turn into hate and fear and he/she starts to denigrate the alienated parent. 2. Frivolous, weak or absurd rationale for the alienation When the child is questioned about the denigrations, he/she give s explanations which are illogical like the alienate d parent's appearance, eating habits or the way the parent cooks food. These arguments are weak and frivolous and cannot specifically make a child reject a parent completely. The child may also make certain unfounded accusations against the other parent. 3. Lack of ambivalence towards the alienating parent In general, a child who loves both his /her parents is able to talk about his /her parents ' good and bad qualities. In cases of parental alienation, a child idolise s the alienating parent and does not hide his/her hostility towards the alienated parent. The child is unable to find any flaws in the alienator 47 Gardn er, R. A. (1998). The Parental Alienation Syndrome: A Guide for Mental Health and Legal Professionals .

Lack of guilt or remorse about the alienation The child who has been programmed is usually cold, spiteful, ungrateful and rude towards the alienated parent. He/she will show no guilt about the way he/she treats the alienated parent. Even if he/she receives gifts or child support from the a lienated parent, he/she will act as if it is owed to them. 5. Borrowed scenarios A child who is alienated often uses phrases and stories commonly uttered by the alienator. The child will make accusations towards the alienated parent and use certain ideas a nd words that he/she does not appear to understand or that he/she cannot explain in details. 6. The \"independent thinker\" phenomenon The child pretends to be an \"independent thinker\" , that is someone who is consciously aware of what he/she is saying and ow ns his/her views and choices without any influence from anyone. 7. Taking the alienating parent's side in the conflict The child supports the alienator in an unwavering manner. He/she refuses to listen to the alienated parent's point of view. The child is brainwashed in such a way that he/she will exclusively side with the alienator no matter how irrational the latter's views may be. 8. Spread of alienation to the extended family of the targeted parent The child not only breaks up ties with the alienated parent , but also wit h the latter's family including grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins and friends. Everything which is related to the alienated parent is rejected by the child. 49 Baker, A. J. L. (2008). Parental Alienation Syndrome \u2014 The Parent/Child Disconnect .

Impact of parental alienation on children During parental separation or divorce situations, more often than not, children are exposed to highly conflictual situations which inevitably impact on their emotional, psychological and social development both in the short -term and the long -term. With the added layer of parental alienation (PA), the child may hold on to the \"false belief that the alienated parent is dangerous and unworthy \" (Kruk, 2013)50, which, sometimes, children may generalise to how they perceive the world and their future adult relationships. The effects of PA on children may be diverse based on, for instance, the degree, frequency and length of the alienator's abuse. Some examples that are commonly reported in PA literature are presented as follows (Baker, 200551; Baker & Damall, 2008; Gardner, 1998; National Parents Organization, n.d.52): 50 Kruk, E. (2013).

Parental alienation in relation to the UNCRC Parental alienation (PA) may affect and even violate children's rights enshrined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child (UN, 1989; refer to Appendix E), as presented in the table below: Article of the UNCRC How may PA affect this right? Article 3: Best interests of the child The best interests of children must be the primary concern in making decisions that may affect them. Adults should think about how their decisions will affect children 's care and well -being . The best interests of children, which lie in having a healthy relationship with both parents, are not taken into consideration during PA. In spite of the damaging effects of PA on the child, the alienator is primarily concerned with his/her self -interests and motive to estrange the child from the other parent. Article 5: Parental guidance This article encourages parents to direct and guide their children so that they can learn to use their rights properly as part of their development . Helping children to understand their rights does not mean pushing them to make choices with consequences t hat they are too young to handle. The UNCRC places on State Parties the responsibility to protect and assist families in fulfilling their essential role as nurturers of children. In PA, the alienator misguides the child with regards to his/her rights and manipulates the latter to behave in ways that negatively affect his/her relationship with the alienated parent. These impact greatly on the child's social and emotional development. The alienator also deprives the alienated parent from his/her r esponsibility to provide direction and guidance to the child in the exercise of his/her rights as recognised by the UNCRC. Parental Alienation | 95 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Article of the UNCRC (ctd) How may PA affect this right? (ctd) Article 7: Registration, name, nationality and care All children have the right to a legally registered name, to a nationality , to know and, as far as possible, to be cared for by their parents. PA violates the right of the child to be cared for by both of his/her parents because the alienator pursues the aim of removing the other parent from the child's life. The alienated parent is also obstructed by the alienator to create opportunities for the child to get to know him/her in a positive way and reinforce their relationship. Article 9: Separation from paren ts A child has the right to live with both of their parents. Children must not be separated from their parents against their will unless it is in their best interests (for example, if a parent is hurting or neglecting a child). Children whose parents have separated have the right to stay in contact with both parents, unless this could cause them harm. In a PA scenario, the alienator may brainwash a child to such an extent that the latter becomes fearful of the alienated parent and thinks that h e/she would harm them. The child is also made to think that the alienated parent does not care for him/her and he/she might see no point in having any contact with the other parent. The child is unable to differentiate between his/her views on the alienate d parent and those of the alienator. The alienator convinces the child that he/she is consciously choosing to reject or separate from the other parent. This deliberate separation and severed contact between the child and the alienated parent are contrary t o his/her best interests. Parental Alienation | 96 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Article of the UNCRC (ctd) How may PA affect this right? (ctd) Article 10: Family reunification The State has a responsibility to respond to applications from a child or his/her parents to live together in the same country. If a child's parents live apart in different States, the child has the right to visit and keep in contact with both of them. Most of the time, the alienating parent has the primary responsibility of the child. In circumstances where the alienated parent lives in a different country, it might become easier for the alienator to limit communications and maintain physical and emotional distance between the child and the other parent. The alienator's strategies incite the child to refuse visits and con tact from the other parent living abroad. Article 12: Respect for the views of the child The UNCRC encourages adults to listen to the opinions of children who have the capacity to form and express their views and to involve them in decision -making. When adults are taking decisions that affect children, the latter have the right to say what they think on matters concerning them and have their opinions taken into account relative to their age and level of maturity. In PA, the child who has been programmed internalises the voice and views of the alienating parent. He/she only follows the instructions of the alienator and rarely challenges the latter. Even if the child has an age and adequate maturity to give his/her views, the a lienator does not provide the child with this opportunity, and decides or imposes how the child must behave towards the other parent. Parental Alienation | 97 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Article of the UNCRC (ctd) How may PA affect this right? (ctd) Article 18: Parental responsibilities Both parents share responsibility for bringing up their child, and should always consider what is best for the child. According to the UNCRC, State Parties should respect the responsibility of parents for providing appropriate guidance to their children. The a lienating parent's strategies to estrange the child from the other parent make it highly challenging or almost impossible for the alienated parent to participate in the child's upbringing. Decisions about the child are monopolised by the alienator, hence v iolating the right of the child to have both parents contribute to his/her development. Article 19: Protection from all forms of violence Children have the right to be protected from being hurt and mistreated, physically or mentally. The UNCRC stresses on the responsibility of State Parties to ensure that children are properly cared for and protected from violence, abuse and neglect by their parents, or anyone else who looks after them. PA is considered as a form of emotional abuse on the child by the alienating parent, who is using his/her position of trust, power and authority to manipulate the latter in rejecting the other parent. PA can have long - term adverse consequences on the psychological, emotional and social development of the child. I t therefore violates the fundamental right of the child to be protected by their parent from all forms of violence. Parental Alienation | 98 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 3.4. Parental alienation in the Republic of Mauritius 3.4.1. No current local statistics, law or policy on parental alienation The Repu blic of Mauritius has ratified the UNCRC in 1990 and has committed itself to fulfil the fundamental rights of all children. Although the provisions of the UNCRC have not yet been domesticated, or enacted within local legislation, our country acknowledges t he important roles of both parents in the overall development and protection of their child, as stated in articles 371 -2 and 371 -4 of \u00e0 son \u00e9gard droit et devoir de garde, de surveillance et L'enfant a peut faire obstacle \u00e0 l'exercice ce dro it. tel est l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de l'enfant, la Cour Supr\u00eame fixe les modalit\u00e9s des relations entre l'enfant et un tiers, parent ou non. Parental alienation (PA) is a poorly recognised and understudied concept within our national context and there currently exis ts no local policies or laws that refer to this matter. PA occurs most frequently in family situations where parents are either separated or divorced. Referring to Gender Statistics on divorce in the Republic of Mauritius over the last three years (Statist ics Mauritius, 201753, 201854, 201955), an increase in the number of divorce cases has been noted between the years 2017 and 2018, as shown in the table below. From 2017 to 2019, an average of 64.2 per cent of divorce cases involved at least one child who was dependent on one of the divorcees when the divorce petition was filed. 53 Statistics Mauritius (2017).

They may experience mixed feelings like shock, anger and guilt and blam e themselves for this situation. They can also often be victim of unintentional or intentional parental alienation as explained in sub -sections 3.2.1 to 3.2.3 of the present chapter. Given the significant impact of PA on the upbringing, development and right s of the child (refer to the current chapter's sub -sections 3.2.4 and 3.3), it is necessary to increasingly sensitise everyone on this phenomenon. 3.4.2. The Ombudsperson for Children's initiative to raise public awareness on parental alienation In the ye ars 2018 and 2019, the Ombudsperson for Children (OC) carried out a sensitisation campaign entitled \"Say no to Parental Alienation: Children deserve the love of both their parents\" in 35 Citizens Advice Bureaux across the island of Mauritius and in Rodrigu es. The main objective of th is action was to promote the right of children to have a loving and nurturing relationship with both parents , irrespective of whether they were separated or not. During the campaign, it became clear that people were not aware of the concept of parental alienation (PA). When they understood what it meant, some parents related their own experiences of having been victims of PA or shared that they were aware of cases of PA in their wider family or neighbourhood. Throughout the year, the Ombudsperson for Children's Office (OCO) registers many complaints related to family conflicts that affect the rights and well -being of the children involved. For instance, these complaints might be related to Parental Alienation | 100 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children the non -respect of Court Orders by one or both of the divorced parents; one of the parents being deprived of his right to visit and meet his/her child; the best interests of the child not being considered within family conflicts; or grandparents not being allowed to have any contact with their grandchild. Over the last 3 reporting years from July 2017 to June 2020, a total of 161 investigations related to complaints on family conflicts have been carried out at the OCO, as broken down in the table below. Reporting Period Number of family conflict cases July 2017 - June 2018 30 July 2018 - June 2019 80 July 2019 - June 2020 51 TOTAL 161 In family conflict cases, the OC generally uses the method of mediation , as mandated by section 7(3) (a) of the Ombudsperson for Children Act (OCA) 2003, to resolve disputes related to the rights of the child. The conflicting parties are convened together at the OCO to reflect on the matter in an independent and objective manner, and to place the best interests of t he child at the heart of any recommendations or decisions. Based on observations and analyses of such cases, the OC often notes the likely presence of parental alienation. For the same period (i.e. from July 2017 to June 2020), the OC also received a tota l of 90 complaints from parents whose court cases were still ongoing in relation to matters of divorce, child custody or Variation Orders, amongst others. However, as stated in the section 7(4) of the OCA 2003, \"[t]he Ombudsperson for Children shall not in vestigate any case which is pending before any Court but may refer any child involved in such a case to the Ministry for advice, assistance or counselling \". These complaints were referred on to the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family Welfare for appropr iate actions. In one of these complaints, a divorced father had written to the OC on the turmoil that he was experiencing in a child custody case in court. Although the OC could not intervene in his case and Parental Alienation | 101 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children referred it to the Child Development Unit, she f elt that this written complaint provided a powerful picture of a potential case of parental alienation. An extract of this parent's letter is provided below: Extract of a letter sent to the OC by a divorced father who complained on his predicament during a child custody case \"As a father, divorce is still to date the most difficult experience I had to deal with in my entire life. The first stages of divorce were traumatizing but I always believed that there will be light at the end of the tunnel...I put all my faith in our leg al system and mostly in the lawyer who defended my case. I always believed that justice is fair and equal. I was new to Court and unsure how court cases evolve, but the pressure of finishing with my case to start another seemed to be more important to co urt. No time was given to explain anything. The judge asked my ex[ -wife] and me with our lawyers to step outside Court to decide on [the] custody for [the] kids. We had about 10 minutes to decide everything about [the] custody of [our] kids. My lawyer pres sed me to accept \"tort partage\" as he scared me with lots of problems that will follow if I maintain my stand of innocence. The [number] of mistakes on the Court Order [was] amazing and my lawyer just induced me in error as he was in a hurry to file my ca se. I never knew we had to write every single detail in the order, for example, [we had to decide], [On] all public holidays, who [would] get [the] kids and what time [they should be] pick[ed] up and drop[ped]; Who [would] pick up [the] children and who [ would] drop them; Who [would] get them on birthdays; Who [would] get them on Christmas and New year and when; [and] Who [would have] the kids from weeks 1 -4, but we forgot week 5. Parental Alienation | 102 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children [extract continued] Court needs to be more flexible as we are dealing with young children and lawyers need to advise and see to it that children have a fair share of living with both parents as they are the ones who suffer more. In my Court Order it says: \"father to pick up...\" I was working on one weekend and asked my parents to pick up the children. They were refused by my ex[ -wife], as [the] Court Order says 'father to pick up' and not grandparents. I tried to get a correction via my attorney, but no chance. I had to pay my attorney and apply for a Variation Order an d it's been nearly 3 years and the case is still in court. My children are still paying a heavy price for no fault of theirs. Before my divorce I believed in shared parenting and even quit my job after my son was 4 months old to stay [at] home, to allow m y wife to continue advancing in her career. In 2013, I unexpectedly faced [a] divorce, even when I sacrificed big potential earnings for the welfare of my family. I felt ashamed to ask for alimony or child support as I was so affected that I could not conc entrate in my job. To date, I am still struggling to get a decent child custody arrangement that will provide me with sufficient parenting time with my children as I want to give them the best opportunities in life. It is important to get in touch with a good and reputable divorce lawyer who focuses on children's rights. They can help parents navigate the ins and outs of the divorce process and give them the resources [they] need to educate themselves about the intricacies of family law. Unfortunately, I was given the wrong advice that eventually made me lose most of my rights as a father and to date I still suffer and yearn to gain access to my children and participate in their education. Many divorced fathers believe child custody laws are biased against them in favour of mothers. As a divorced father, I was told right at the beginning that I was less likely to receive primary custody of my children and therefore, more likely to be ordered to pay monthly child support. Ideally, those child support payment s would be used to ensure all the necessary expenses required to provide for a child to be taken good care of. Parental Alienation | 103 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children [extract continued] In reality, this is not the case. My children hardly enjoy their alimony and I have to buy most of their necessities as there is no control of how much is spent on them. The alimony I actually pay to my ex[-wife] is being used to pay for the huge legal cost that my ex[ -wife] has in Court and hardly any is spent on the children. There's no accountability [on] how this money is used for my children. Many times, the mother would send my children in torn clothes or clothes that don't fit, when confronted she would text, \"when they come to your house, make them wear good clothes then\". I have numerous cases in Court but the waiting time is very long. The amount of time the court takes is ridiculous, I cannot to date take any decisions concerning my child as I am still waiting to know if I will be granted custody or not. 3.5. The OC's recommendations 3.5.1. More sensitisat ion on parental alienation Multi -stakeholder sensitisation campaigns on the concept of parental alienation (PA) and its signs, symptoms and effects on children could be jointly organised by relevant governmental and parastatal bodies as well as civil socie ty organisations working with children and families. The sensitisation campaigns could be designed based on the needs of different target groups such as children, parents, law professionals, medical staff, mental health professionals, social workers, child protection officers, probation officers, teachers and the police. Our country could also consider to celebrate the Parental Alienation Awareness Day on April 25th on a national scale to disseminate information on this phenomenon to the public at large. 3.5.2. Local research on parental alienation Rigorous and long -term local research on the effects of PA on children and families and the experiences of the alienator, the alienated parent and the children involved should be studied. So far, cases of PA Parental Alienation | 104 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children have been dealt on a case -by-case basis, rather than as a societal issue with considerable social, public health and economic consequences for our country. Research and collection of national statistics on PA are also necessary so that policies and laws could be enhanced to prevent and address this specific phenomenon. 3.5.3. Law-making on parental alienation The effects of PA are no less damaging than those produced by child abuse, neglect or exploitation. Along with increasing the public's awareness and do ing research and data collection on PA, it is proposed that this phenomenon could be recognised in child -related legislation as a form of child maltreatment and considered as a punishable offence by a Court of Law. 3.5.4. Educational programmes in the con text of parental separation or divorce Education al programmes could be developed for parents who are deciding to separate from or divorce each other . Their main aim could be to provide information and advice to parents on how they should deal with their children in the context of a separation or divorce. For instance, the parents can be educated on how to maintain clear boundaries between their adult conflicts and their relationship with the children, and on the need to give primary consideration t o the best interests of their children in all decisions. They could also learn about the concept of PA and its negative impact on children. These programmes could also offer parents the knowledge and skills to navigate the Court system and to consider alte rnative dispute resolution strategies. 3.5.5. The appointment of a Family Court Adviser PA can at times be hard to prove in a Court of Law . As explained in sub -section 3.2.2 of the current chapter, the alienating parent can go to considerable lengths to e xert control on the child's movements, wishes and views relative to the other parent, often without the child's conscious realisation. In order to minimise the undue influence of the alienating parent on the child's views and wants during court proceedings , and to prevent violation of the child's right to express his/her views freely according to article 12 of the UNCRC, a Family Court Adviser, who is well trained in child psychology, children's rights Parental Alienation | 105 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children and child custodial issues, could be appointed for thes e purposes. This professional would build rapport with the child and assess the latter's needs, wishes and feelings in relation to his/her parents' divorce. He/she could also accompany the parents and the ir child throughout the court proceedings to ensure that the rights of the child are being given due consideration by the parents.

Introduction \"One billion children globally experience some for m of emotional, physical or sexual violence every year; and one child dies as a result of violence every five minutes\" (United Nations [UN], n.d.)56, a shocking reality for all of us. Children are the most vulnerable human beings and we cannot expect them to be responsible for their own needs and safety. Every adult has an undeniable duty to protect any child from harm and educate the latter on his/he r safety. However, some adults in the world fail to understand this simple fact and create circumstances that expose children to various forms of abuse and neglect. One of the targets of the Sustainable Development Goal 16 is to \"end abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children\" by 2030 (UN, 2016)57. A challenging undertaking indeed, but not impossible if the necessary interventions from all relevant stakeholders are carried out at national, regional and interna tional levels in a targeted, intensive, timely and efficient manner. It is important to note that the Republic of Mauritius is one of the ratifying countries of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (UN, 1989)58 and it has made a commitment to safeguar d children from all forms of harm as per article 19(1) of this Convention: States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child. Recently , we were moved by the cases of sexual abus e against two siblings of 3 and 9 years old respectively in R\u00e9sidence Anoska , which stirred debates on the local mechanisms in place to respond to children in distress on the field. There are no single, miraculous solution to ending this complex and multi -layered phenomenon of child abuse. Real and sustainable change will lie in nurturing the synergy and collaboration among all relevant stakeholders and tightening the safety net around children, 56 United Nations (n.d.)

Geneva: Author. Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 110 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 especially those living in deprived regions, to protect them from potential perpetrators within and outside their families. In the following sections, the profile of whistle -blowers on child abuse and potential barriers to reporting on abuse perpetrated against children are described . Then, the activities carr ied out before, during and after a two - day networking forum , that was organised by the Ombudsperson for Children's Office with community members living in R\u00e9sidence Anoska and professionals working with children of this locality , are presented in details . 4.2. Who is a whistle -blower on child abuse? ANYONE CAN BE A WHISTLE -BLOWER ON CHILD ABUSE. As a general rule, everyone who is determined to have an adequate level of maturity has a responsibility to disclose any actual or suspected case of child abuse. T he diagram on the next page illustrates examples of whistle -blowers , who can be the authorities, civil society organisations and different groups of people, at times, including children. Firstly, t he Child Development Unit (CDU) of the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family Welfare is the authority responsible for handling child protection cases in the Republic of Mauritius. It operates a hotline number, that is 113, to obtain confidential referrals from anyone expressing concerns on actual or potential ca ses of child abuse and to intervene accordingly. Other institutions such as the Police and the Brigade pour la Protection des Mineurs are also involved in identifying cases of children requiring protection on the field and referring them to the CDU. The OC O is a human rights institution that focusses on ensuring that the rights of our country's children, including their right to protection from all forms of violence, are being respected by all concerned stakeholders. Upon receipt of complaints or on its own motion, the OCO can also investigate on whether all necessary actions to safeguard children's rights have been taken by the relevant authorities. \"Real and sustainable change will lie in nurturing the syne rgy and collaboration among all relevant stakeholders and tightening the safety net around children, especially those living in deprived regions ...\" ~ R. V enkatasawmy, Ombudsperson for Children Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 111 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 People involved in the care of children such as parents, wider family relatives, neighbours and any commu nity member can act as important whistle -blowers to provide first -hand information on actual or potential child abuse. Furthermore, school staff as well as any professional working with children (e.g. doctors, nurses, psychologists, therapists, social work ers, etc.), who notice signs of abuse or obtain a disclosure of abuse from a child, have the duty to report same to the authorities. Another category of whistle -blowers is civil society organisations, including non -governmental and community -based Whistle - blowers on child abuse Authorities School staff Any professional working with children Children Media Any community member Neighbours Parents and wider family relatives Civil Society Organisations Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 112 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 organisations. They are often in close contact with members of the community, including children, and can play an important role in flagging up potential cases of child abuse to the authorities. In addition, the media can come across such cases on the field and relay information to the authorities. Finally, children, especially those who have an adequate level of maturity and discernment, can act as whistle -blowers. They can disclose abuse perpet rated against them or other children to a responsible adult or to the authorities directly. It is important to know that, according to section 39A(2) of the Criminal Code Act 1838 on 'culpable omission', \"any person who wilfully omits to provide to a per son in danger such assistance as he could, without any risk to himself or to a third party, provide to that person by his own intervention or by calling for help shall be punished by a fine not exceeding 10,000 rupees and by imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years\" . In relation to child protection, it can be inferred that it is every citizen's responsibility to assist or seek help from relevant authorities for any child who is a victim or at risk of abuse. 4.3. Potential barriers to reporting on chil d abuse Different factors can become obstacles to reporting abuse perpetrated against children. Some potential ones are proposed in the list provided on the next page. To better inform policies and interventions in the protection of children from abuse, more in-depth and rigorous local research on barriers to whistleblowing on child abuse could be considered. People involved in the care of children such as parents, wider family relatives, neighbours and any community member can act as important whistle -blowers to provide first -hand information on actual or potential child abuse. Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 113 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 Anindividual might fear retaliation orrevenge from theactual or potential perpetrator ifthelatter knows that he/she made areport ofchild abuse against him/her .

Lack of trust in authorities Without training and sensitisation, staff members from any professional background may lack theappropriate knowledge and skills onhow toidentify signs ofactual orpotential child and intervene insuch . Untrained staff Attimes, itmay happen that information onchild abuse ispoorly communicated internally among the relevant authorities, which may result indelays indecision -making and interventions onthe field .There can also becases where whistle -blowers provide inaccurate orinsufficient networking among stakeholders Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 114 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 4.4. A networking forum between community members and child professionals 4.4.1. Rationale Poor networking among relevant stakeholders can often make it easier for actual or potential abuse against children to remain unidentified, unreported and undealt with. The Ombudsperson for Children is mandated by section 6(l) of the Ombudsperson for Children Act 2003 to \"advise the Minister on the creation of partnerships with parents, teachers, non -governmental as well as governmental organisations, local authorit ies and any other stakeholders committed to the promotion of children's rights\" . In this context and given the recent happenings regarding child abuse, the OCO organi sed a two -day networking forum that was aimed at fostering partnerships in the protection of children against all forms of abuse between active community members of R\u00e9sidence Anoska and professionals working with children of this region. The forum was entitled \"Strengthening the safety net to protect children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska from all forms of abuse through the dynamic partnership between community members and child professionals\" . This activity was one attempt to bridge the gaps in understanding and communication between these two stakeholder groups in the promotion of child protection. 4.4.2. Specific Objectives The specific objectives of the networking forum were as follows: \"...recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world...\" ~ Preamble of the UN Convention on Rights of the Child Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 115 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 4.4.3. Expected outcomes The expected outcomes from this networking forum were mainly: 1.Toprovide aconducive platform foractive community members from R\u00e9sidence Anoska and child professionals tointeract, share experiences and information, and network regarding child protection onaface-to-face basis . 2.Toempower thecommunity members tobecome efficient whistle -blowers families ofabuse . 3.Tosensitise child professionals onhow toadvise and streamline totheappropriate support services and relevant authorities . 4.Torecommend tothe relevant authorities acommunity member -professional partnership community members living in R\u00e9sidence Anoska and professionals working with children ofthis locality 2.Improved motivation and commitment ofcommunity members toengage actively inthecombat against child abuse within their locality . 3.Increased understanding ofcommunity members onhow tointervene cases within thelocality . 4.Aclear communication pathway between thecommunity members and the child professionals . 5.Aproposal for areplicable and sustainable community member -professional partnership model made totheMinistry ofGender Equality and Family Welfare that can enhance whistle -blowing onchild abuse within alldeprived regions ofthe Republic ofMauritius .

Preparatory activities prior to the networking forum As the adage goes, failing to plan is planning to fail. This is why a fair amount of time was invested within the preparations of the 2 -day networking forum. The OC and her team, as well as the community members of R\u00e9sidence Anoska and the selected c hild professionals, were actively involved in planning every single detail of the forum to ensure its relevance, smooth running and success. Several preparatory meetings and visits were held in this process as outlined in the table below: The preparatory meetings and activities carried out are described in sub -sections 4.5.1 to 4.5.10 of the present chapter . The 2 -day networking forum with community members and child professionals was held on 12 and 13 August 2020 at Palms Hotel, Quatre Bornes, and is detailed in section 4.6.

Many of them voiced their concerns on the stigmati sation of the people living in areas such as R\u00e9sidence Anoska . It was also noted that there seemed to be a lack of coordination between the various institutions (both governmental and non - governmental) , and sometimes NGOs repeated similar work as their coun terparts. The problem of adequate housing had also been enunciated to be a risk factor for other issues within the family such as child abuse . 4.5.2. 21 July 2020: First preparatory meeting with child professionals working in R\u00e9sidence Anoska Several rep resentatives from different governmental bodies and NGOs who have previously worked with children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska were present at this meeting. Again, it was noted that coordinated collaboration was lacking among these child professionals in their inte rventions within this locality. Moreover, d espite the significant and commendable work of the N ational Social Inclusion Foundation (NSIF) and the National Empowerment Foundation (NEF) to help destitute and disadvantaged individuals on the field, some of the attendees were still unclear, or even unaware , of the ir roles and functions. Some professionals were of the view that there was a lack of trust among residents of R\u00e9sidence Anoska towards some governmental organisations. \"Failing to plan is planning to fail... planning every single detail of the forum to ensure its relevance, smooth running and success .\" Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 118 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 At the end of this meeting, all those present highlighted the necessity of the networking forum proposed by the OCO. A representative from each of the organisations present w as to be invited to the forum. The idea of reinforcing the partnership between community members of R\u00e9sidence Anoska and the child professionals through clearly defined pairing activities was supported by everyone. It was also decided that the OCO would organise a meeting with the inhabitants of R\u00e9sidence Anoska on 28 July 2020. 4.5.3. 23 July 2020: Meeting with staff and students of Midlands Government School Given that the majority of vulnerable children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska are enrolled at Midlands Government School, the OC and an Investigator carried out a visit at this institution. The Headmaster and his staff had the opportunity to highlight some challenges they faced with respect to certain students, such First preparatory meeting at OCO with child professionals Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 119 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 as lack of body hygiene and proper clothing , and regular absenteeism. The staff members were briefed on the role and functions of th e OC, the different types of child abuse and their duty to report such cases of child abuse to the authorit y. Both the teaching and management staff acknowledged that they were now better informed on the mechanisms in place to ensure the protection of children against all forms of abuse and their key roles as whistle -blowers. 4.5.4. 28 July 2020: Interactive meeting with inhabitants of R\u00e9sidence Anoska This interactive meeting was attended by a considerable number of inhabitants of R\u00e9sidence Anoska who showed a high level of interest in improving the safety of their children. The OC accompanied by an Investigator from the OCO were welcomed by the Community Le ader of the locality, Mr Joseph L. As a gesture of appreciation, the school gave a beautifully crafted card to the OC through the hands of three enthusiastic young pupils Mr Joseph L. Pierre Louis, Community Leader, addressing the inhabitants Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 120 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 Pierre Louis (also known as Ricall) . The OC motivated all those present to engage in the networking forum and to become active protectors of the children of their locality from all forms of abuse. The OC and the Investigator also explained the role of the OCO, and even quizzed the attendees on issues of child pr otection. The residents, both young and old, participated actively and freely voiced out their concerns and frustrations. They stated that they want ed to know more about the rights of children . They expressed their willingness to be part of the networking forum. The OC interacting with the residents of Anoska Mr I.

The OC and the Investigator met with the inhabitants of the area to gather information on the situation of children living there. She was apprised of several cases. For instance, i n one particular family, 4 children had been remove d by the CDU, due to the ir deplorable housing conditions. The OC advised the family on practical solutions to improve their living conditions and to be able to obtain custody of their child ren once again. Furthermore, the OC met with the youth of R\u00e9sidence Anoska , whom she believes can bring positive changes in their locality. She encouraged them to participate in the upcoming networking forum, to which they agreed. In general, i t was observed that the comm unity members of R\u00e9sidence Anoska seem ed to be united and willing to contribute towards the progress of their area, especially in tackling the stigma upon their village.

Selection of community members and child professionals for the networking forum Given that obviously not everyone in R\u00e9sidence Anoska could attend the upcoming networking forum, it was decided that 25 community members would be chosen to represent the wider community. Mr Pierre Louis, Community Leader, supported the OCO in the identification and selection of these members. Care wa s taken that this group of community members involved people from different age groups and gender. In order to create a community member -professional partnership model that can promote the protection of children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska from all forms of abuse , 25 professionals who would pair up with each of the community members had to be selected. This selection was mainly based on the scope and duration of the professional 's or his/her organisation's activities with children and/or families of R\u00e9sidence Anoska . In other words, the professional or his/her organisation should have been actively involved with this target group for at least a period of 6 months. The 25 professionals selected came from the following 10 non -governmental organisations which met the above -mentioned criterion: ; d'Aide \u00e0 la Maternit\u00e9 ; Safire ; SOS Children's Village ; Ti Diams ; Unlock Potential ; and Youth for Human Rights . In addition , it was planned that key representatives from g overnmental and parastatal bodies involved in the protection of children would be invited to the networking forum, namely: Child Development Unit (CDU) , Ministry of Gender Equality and Family Welfare; Early Childhood Care and Educati on Authority (ECCEA) ; National Empowerment Foundation (NEF); National Social Integration Foundation (NSIF); Mauritius Police Force ( Brigade pour la Protection des Mineurs ); and Ministry of Education , Tertiary Education, Science and Technology. Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 125 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 4.5.7. 04 August 2020: Second preparatory meeting with child professionals participating in the 2 -day networking forum The information to be imparted as well as strategies to be employed during the networking forum were discussed with the child profession als during the second preparatory meeting. The OC clarified that one of the functions of the networking forum would be to make the residents feel valued and to foster respect for the community. The professionals discussed on the need to listen actively to the community members during the forum and to be aware of their verbal and non -verbal communication towards them. 4.5.8. 10 August 2020: Final preparatory meeting with child professionals participating in the 2 -day networking forum The final details of the networking forum were refined with the child professionals. They were briefed on the information they would have to gather from the community members during the pairing exercise. They were divided in subgroups and were invited to critically analyse an information sheet to Second preparatory meeting with the child professionals Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 126 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 be filled during the forum. Ground rules when engaging with the community members during pairing activities were also discus sed with the professionals during this meeting (see Appendix F).

History of R\u00e9sidence Anoska by Mr J. L. Pierre Louis As the Community Leader of R\u00e9sidence Anoska , Mr J. L. Pierre Louis has constantly contributed to his locality . He is held in high esteem by the community members for his leadership and dedication . At the networking forum, he was the first one to address th e audience, following the welcom e speech. This conveyed the strong message that this platform was designed for the community members to voice out their concerns and opinions freely. Mr Pierre Louis started with an expos\u00e9 on the history of people of R\u00e9sidence Anoska , who were in fact living in the village of La Pipe until 30 years ago. He said that e ach family then already owned a house in La Pipe . However, it happened that they were forced to relocate to R\u00e9sidence Anoska based on the promise that the y would be provided with 10 acres of land - something which never materialised . They had no guarantee of jobs in this new area , yet they all worked together to build their community in R\u00e9sidence Anoska. Today, they have a chapel, a community centre managed by the residents, and leisure activities where the youth can develop freely. Mr J. L. Pierre Louis addressing the audience \"It is not about fishing for them, but rather about only giving them the fishing rod .\" ~ Mr J. L. Pierre Louis Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 131 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 Nonetheless, he criticised some NGOs who appear to publicise their social work to the extent of intruding the privacy of in habitants. He also expressed his concerns on how some members of the press create sensationalism out of news items from R\u00e9sidence Ano ska. He deplored the fact that no media person enquire d with him about the locality or what was being done within the community. He further noted that the situation within many families of the locality is precarious and that their sufferings appear to perpetuate to the next generation. Nonetheless, h e acknowledged the tremendous efforts that many inhabitants of the locality were making to improve their lives and that of their children . In his address, Mr Pierre Loui s appreciated the opportunity that the Ombudsperson for Children has created for them to collaborate more efficiently with NGOs. He felt that the 2 -day networking forum was also a space for the youth of R\u00e9sidence Anoska to be sensitised about the history o f their own community and the importance of contributing to the growth of their locality. He concluded by saying that, \"It is not about fishing for them, but rather about only giving them the fishing rod \". Mr Pierre Louis conversing with Ms J hugroo, Secretary of the OCO Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 132 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 4.6.3. Address by the Ombudsperson for Children In her speech, the OC warmly welcomed the Very Very Important Persons (VVIPs) of this event - the community members of R\u00e9sidence Anoska. She stated that the networking forum was the fruit of the collaboration and commitment of the various organisations and community members who contributed to its thorough preparation. She highlighted that there were many positive things happening in R\u00e9sidence Anoska and applauded the solidarity of the community. However, she pointed out that the problems in the area could not be overlooked. The OC was convinced that the ideas and outcome that would emerge from the pairing of community members and child professionals during this forum would not only benefit the children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska , but also all the other residents. She encouraged the participants to take ownership of their destiny through two important components - building their commitment and expanding their knowledge. Firstly, she explained that commitment to on e's vision is important. One must have dreams and the desire to realise them, but must also be committed to face challenge s and obstacle s that would come on the way. Secondly, seeking useful knowledge that can aid one's vision is equally crucial. In this s ense, the networking forum was providing a unique exchange opportunity for the community members of R\u00e9sidence Anoska to learn about the services provided by the participating governmental agencies and NGOs, and for the child professionals to understand and listen to the residents' experiences, achievements and difficulties. \"Commitment and knowledge are two important components in the journey to owning one's destiny.\" ~ R. Venkatasawmy, Ombudsperson for Children Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 133 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 4.6.4. Making th e community feel valued One of the underlying reasons of this networking forum was to provide a conducive environment, where all participants from R\u00e9sidence Anoska could feel valued and welcomed. To achieve this goal , the OCO 's team took great care in honouring the presence and participatio n of the community members. Firstly, the forum was organised at the venue of Palms Hotel in Quatre Bornes. Secondly, to facilitate their travel to this venue, t he community participants were provided with transport to and from the hotel on both days. During lunch and tea break, the residents had the opportunity to network informally with the child professional s. At the end of the forum, the community members received a Certificate of Participation from the OCO .

Talents of R\u00e9sidence Anoska In the spirit of valuing the community of R\u00e9sidence Anoska , several of its members were invited to perform their talents in front of the forum's audience. On the first day of the event, Ms Marie Marleneda Jolicoeur, a musician from th e locality, interpreted a beautiful song on children and the importance of education for their future. Ms Jolicoeur also performs in mini concerts that are organised in R\u00e9sidence Anoska . Ms Yen Mee of Lovebridge , accompanied her during her performance. Follo wing Ms J olicoeur's performance, Ms Nobin, Deputy Headmistress of Midlands Government School and Sergeant Mungroo from Brigade pour la Protection des Mineurs (BPM) present ed a song entitled \" Ye dosti ham nahin torenge \", which was about the enduring power of friends hip (refer to Appendix G, Part A). All the participants and guests sang in chorus, which changed the atmosphere of the forum from the first day itself to a more relaxed and cheerful one.

All participants were given a copy of the lyrics of the song \" Malheur \u00e0 celui qui blesse un enfant \" (refer to Appendix G, Part B). O nce again, this set the ambience of the forum from the very start to an amicable and warm one. After the lunch break on day 2 of the forum, two teenagers of R\u00e9sidence Anoska marvel led the audience by performing an Afro Dance. Along with being a networking platform, the forum also provided the opportunity to community members and child professionals to express themselves artistically. The performances left everyone to wonder how many more hidden talents and skills are still untapped in R\u00e9sidence A noska due to lack of opportunities and stigmatisation. The performances left us to wonder how many more hidden talents and skills are still untapped in R\u00e9sidence Anoska due to lack of opportunities and stigmatisation. The teenagers stunned everyone with their dancing talents Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 136 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 4.6.7. Activities of the networking forum Several activities , as described below, were organised to sensitise and engage the participants with respect to child rights and child protection. These were planned in a way to have the most interaction possible with the audience. 4.6.7.1. Ice-breaking session Participants were asked to walk around the conference room and to introduce themselves to as many pe ople they can over 5 minutes. This activity livened up the atmosphere and helped in breaking down hesitation and barriers that existed between the representatives of the institutions and the community participants . The ice breaking session livened the mood of the forum Sergeant Mungroo conversing with a young resident of Anoska Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 137 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 4.6.7.2. Quiz by Investigators A quiz was prepared by Mr Bawamia and Ms Jogarah, I nvestigators of the OCO. Eleven multiple -choice questions were asked to the audience. This was an active way for all present to learn on the various rights of children and duties of parents, and the role of each institution involved in child protection. The questions put to the audience also encouraged them to re spond and express their concerns . Below are some important points highlighted by some participants: \"The CDU should explore all alternative possibilities of child protection before removing a child from his family as a last resort, since separation from the home causes great distress to the child and the family. \" \"On one occasion at a school , an Officer -in-Charge refused to hand over a studen t to the CDU, as she was not informed of the reason for such removal. The child in question did not come to school for three days following the incident. On another instance , a child hid in the toilet when he was aware that CDU officers had come to take him away. \" Mr Bawamia (left) and Ms Jogarah (right), OCO investigators, quizzing the participants Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 138 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 \"A mediator between the family and CDU, who can create a rel ationship of trust between the parties , could be appointed .\" \"NGOs can facilitate the missing link between parents and the authorities, and more should be done to rehabilitate the child and send him/her back to his/her family. \" \"Being myself an orphan, a nd having no child of my own, I underst and the pain of living alone. A child should not just be removed from a family when they have existing problems. The issues should be acknowledged , but also the family itself must be empowered rather than broken apart .\" 4.6.7.3. Pairing activity In this activity, each resident was randomly paired with another participant, who were officers from the OCO, NGOs and government institutions. The primary aim was to collect information about each participating resident and also give them an opportunity to voice out their concerns about their locality and the progress they want ed to see as well . It is worth highlight ing that the non -resident participants were formerly trained during the preparatory phase prior to the forum on how to interact specifically All the participants engaged well during the pairing activity Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 139 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 with their paired resident . They were also given a list of guidelines to help them interact positively an d respectfully with their interlocutor (see Appendix F). The residents were very receptive to this activity. After wards , the community members were asked for feedback on this pairing exercise . The responses were indeed very positive. For instance, i t was said that the pairing activity was a stimulating exercise where everyone engaged well with each other. It was also an opportunity to know someone new and to learn interesting aspects of their life. 4.6.7.4. \"T\u00e9l\u00e9phone Arabe\" (Chinese Whispers) \"T\u00e9l\u00e9phone Arabe \" is a very classic and popular game . It has never ceased to be entertaining or fun to any generation. This particular activity was an interactive way of showing the participants how information c ould be distorted along the chain of communication, if not properly transmitted. Through this game, t he participants were sensitised as to the dangers of relaying unconfirmed , misleading or wrong information. The OC also explained that an investigation is initiated when a complaint is made in relation to possible loopholes in the mechanisms in place for child protection or alleged failure s of concerned authorities to act diligently. The reaction of the participants was optimistic. They understood how neglig ence or recklessness in sharing information, especially unverified news, c ould lead to conflicts, disruption and even violence within families and communities.

CDU acts as a child protector, not a \"child snatcher\" One of the objectives of the networking forum was to empower the community members of R\u00e9sidence Anoska to become whistle -blowers with respect to violators of children 's rights. To achieve this, it was important to inform them of the role of the main authority for child protection - the Child Development Unit ( CDU ) - and to dispel any misconceptions they might have had regarding the CDU . Therefore, the OC deemed important to expatiate on the purpose and functions of the CDU. The OC explained h ow in almost every country, there is an institution similar to the CDU, albeit under different names. When a child is a victim of (or at risk of) violence or abuse, the law empowers such authority to remove the Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 143 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 CHILD PROTECTION ACT 1994 11. Duty to repo rt Notwithstanding any other enactment, where a medical practitioner, a dental surgeon or a teacher has reasonable ground to suspect that a child he is examining, treating or teaching, as the case may be, has been ill -treated, neglected, abandoned or other wise exposed to harm, he shall immediately notify the Permanent Secretary. child and to place him in a safe and secure p lace. In Mauritius, the CDU does a n assessment before deciding to remove a child. The OC used a case example to illustrate why sometimes the CDU cannot be blamed when a child is not afforded the much -needed protection. She asked everyone to imagine that a n 8-year -old child was being beaten by his father and that no one in the neighbourhood alert ed the police. Then, one day, the same child was unfortunately beaten to death. The media then would often be quick to blame the CDU for not doing its work. Yet, in this particular scenario, the CDU is not at fault as it was not alerted in the first place . Thus, the OC emphasised the crucial and complementary role of NGOs, who are not just social workers, but also whistle -blowers in such cases. She urged the collabor ation of everyone to work together in a non -violent and peaceful way. She additionally underlined the criminal liability of someone who fails to report a case of child abuse or child neglect as per the Child Protection Act 1994. Ms Chooramun, Head of the CDU, was also invited to the forum to present on the role and functions of the CDU in more details to the community members. She described how the CDU was instituted for the development and protection of children. She clarified that, under the Mauritian Civil Code , parents are the primary carers of children and have the main duty to cater for them. Hence when parents are in conflict, it is children who suffer the most. Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 144 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 Moreover, the Head of the CDU explained that, w hen parents are unable to give adequate care to their child , the CDU steps in to assess how to help the family . The institution aims at preventing all types of child abuse and protecting actual or potential child victims. She also outlined different cases where parents themselves endanger the ir child's safety, and thus removal of the child from their homes becomes a necessity . For instance , when a child was allegedly being beaten by a parent , the child w ould be taken for medical assessment by the CDU , and i t might be that the parents w ould be denied access to the child . Many participants voiced out their concerns that CDU officers \"snatch\" children away from their families and cause much distress to them. One particular community member complained that Officers of the CDU demanded that , in order to obtain custody of his children, he had to arrange for separate bedrooms for each one of them. After listening to various participants' concerns, Ms Chooramun cleared existing confusions about the rationale behind child removal from a family. She clarified that Ms Chooramun, Head of the CDU, responding to questions of participants Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 145 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 whilst there is a need to have minimum food provisions and a minimum level of hygiene for the children, the sole fact that one lives in poverty, even absolute poverty, is not a reason to remove a child from h is family. Furthermore, a child professional insisted on the need for better communication between parents and the CDU , especially when their children are being removed during school hours, without the knowledge of the parents. A member of an NGO suggested that case studies could be analysed to find ways to improve current child protection services. In the same vein, Ms Dom ah, CDU Officer , explained how the CDU has the obligation to investigate the veracity of a complaint by a whistle -blower, regarding child abuse. The informants can be anyone from school personnel, relatives, and NGOs amongst others. If a child is a victim or at risk of abuse, the CDU officers will look for other family members that can cater for the child. Only when no one is willing to take responsibility of the child, that he/she is placed in a shelter or residential care institution . The next step is the n to work towards the reintegration of the child into his /her family. The discussions between Ms Chooramun and the participants appeared to have cleared the doubts and apprehensions of participants with respect to the role and functions of the CDU as a child protector and not a \"child snatcher\" . These interactions also seemed to have fostered better relations among the stakeholders. 4.6.8.2. The OC explains on the different types of child abuse One cannot talk about child protection without understanding what child abuse is. During the networking forum, the OC detailed clearly the definition of child abuse and the four different types of child violence that exist . In essence, the OC outlined to the participants that, firstly, physical abuse i s when a child is physically assaulted. Usually, this w ould be apparent on the child's body such as bruises or swells. Secondly, verbal abuse is usually a non-visible form of child abuse , where the self -esteem of the child is adversely affected through the use of foul and demeaning language against the child. Next, The CDU has the obligation to investigate the veracity of a complaint by a whistle -blower, regarding child abuse. Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 146 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 sexual abuse is another type of child abuse, where the world of the child is torn apart and which can result in a lifelong trauma. T he audience was also warned on the realities of grooming. Fourt hly, c hild neglect is often a form of abuse that many are unaware of. For instance, t his includes the carer's negligence in giving adequate food to the child and providing him with decent clothing. Moreover , a video on child sexual abuse, produced by the O CO, was played to further sensitise the audience on the issue. 4.6.8.3. Works carried out by the NSIF, NEF and NGOs within R\u00e9sidence Anoska \"Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach a man how to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.\" This well -known proverb resonated throughout the preparatory meetings, where residents affirmed that they just need a little support to be able to make their community a better place to live. Hence, in the networking forum, it was important to lay clearly before the residents, the different facilities and activities available in their locality so that they can make optimum use of these. In line with this objective, officers from the NSIF and NEF, as well as representatives of NGOs, were invited to address the audience to inform them on their works, especially those being done in R\u00e9sidence Anoska . In his brief intervention , Mr Pierre Louis , the Community Leader, detailed the various projects that the community offers currently to its residents such as artisanal works th at are carried out by women, amongst which are Ms Azie Collet Odile and Ms Perrine Claudette (community participants). 4.6.8.3.1. National Social Inclusion Foundation (NSIF) Ms Priscilla Ravaton, Programme Manager at the NSIF, firstly presented on the bri ef history of the NSIF . She then elaborated on its works and various funding programmes categorised in 10 priority areas59, including socio -economic development; educational support and training; social housing; leisure and sports; and supporting people with disabilities. She also highlighted that NSIF works in collaboration with NGOs . Furthermore, she clarified that before financial assistan ce is granted to a potential beneficiary, there are steps that must be followed and the validation of the NSIF Council is required. It must also be noted 59 Please visit the website of NSIF on www.nsif.mu for more information. Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 147 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 that the NSIF has indicators of performance, such that they can follow -up each beneficiary and note the outcome of each assistance provided. Another way NSIF support s communities is through its funding framework, where it grants constant support to NGOs who are essential in the running of projects within communities. Ms Ravaton also pointed out that they are accountable to the Director of Audit , as they are dealing with public funds, which explains the extensive paperwork to work through. Should there be any misappropriation of funds or fraud, complaints can be made to I ndepende nt Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). N SIF also finances the management of 14 residential care institutions (RCIs). With regards to financial aid from the NSIF, Ms Ravaton informed the participants that P arent Teachers Associations (PTAs) and other orga nisations can register for funding with the NSIF . She encouraged the residents to form an association representative of their community and present their projects to the NSIF to apply for funding.

National Empowerment Foundation (NEF) Ms Trisha Jogessur, Community Project Coordinator at the NEF, explained the functions and procedures within this organisation . The NEF60 targets families who live in vulnerable conditions. Once a person registers at the Ministry of Social Integration, Social Security and National Solidarity, an Officer will conduct a field visit to assess whether he/she fits the eligibility criteria. If he/she is deemed suitable, then the person is invited to sign a social contract at the NEF. She also added that, under t he Marshall Plan Social Contract, NEF Officers visit the registered families to help them identify their priorities and become fully funct ioning famil ies. Ms Raghu Ankusha, Case Management Officer at NEF, detailed clearly how they assess a family's situation and how they conduct enquiries. There are different axes of intervention that the NEF consider such as education, health and financial income of the family. In terms of educational support, Ms Jogessur explained the conditions under which child allowance and school materials can be obtained. Additionally, those who completed their secondary studies are given monetary rewards by the NEF. It is interesting to note that some beneficiaries have in fact used their reward to pay for their courses or university fees, to buy a laptop or to invest it as capital for starting their own business. For those sitting for their O -level exam inations for t he second time in order to improve their results, the NEF pays the exam fees. With respect to economic empowerment, if parents are working or undergoing training, the nursery fees are paid for by the NEF . Job fairs and training workshops are also organised for NEF beneficiaries. A \"soutien d'accompagnement \" is provided to those starting up a business. In terms of housing support, Ms Jogessur explained different ways in which NEF can assist a beneficiary to secure adequate housing 60 More information on the services of the NEF can be found on its website on www.nef.mu . Ms Jogessur detailing on the functions of the NEF Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 149 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 for himself and hi s family. If one owns a piece of land, they can be financially assisted with their house construction. Moreover, aid is provided for the reparation of houses. Nevertheless, Ms Jogessur underlined that sanctions are taken against those who have signed a so cial contract with the NEF, but are unwilling to engage with the opportunities provided and fail to abide by the agreed terms and conditions. She concluded by assuring the community participants that the NEF is willing to work with them and collaborate wit h National Housing Development Company (NHDC) Ltd to ensure their right to adequate housing. 4.6.8.3.3. ATD Quart Monde Ms Maria Victoire stated that ATD Quart Monde is an NGO that has been engaged in the fight against poverty over the last 30 years. The NGO equip s families to support one an other. She further detailed the different \"ateliers \" at the disposal of R\u00e9sidence Anoska to help empower the families living there. One interesting concept is the weekly Biblioth\u00e8que de Rue that encourage s the children to read, especially those having difficulties to integrate the conventional setting of school s, and to improve their general knowledge in addition to academic concepts . She motivated the resident s present at the forum and affirmed her conviction that empow ered families are the key to end their misery. 4.6.8.3.4. DIS-MOI Ms Hon Fat, from Dis Moi, presented on the different types of conjugal violence. She handed out a pamphlet on \"Violantomet\", an interesting way to identify the various levels of domestic violence and when it becomes crucial to ask for help or put an end to one's relationship altogether. 4.6.8.3.5. SOS Children's Village Ms Edoo, from SOS Village, worked for approximately 10 years in R\u00e9sidence Anoska . The work of SOS Children's Village is centred around education. In fact, the organisation has an education learning centre at the disposal of the children. For the youth of the area, they provide career guidance , and for those who are out of school, they are sign -posted to the Mauriti us Institute for Training and Development (MITD ).

T1 Diams Ms Auroomoogum, from T 1 Diams, has been working for 15 years in R\u00e9sidence Anoska and the NGO provides support and assistance to patients suffering from Type 1 Diabetes. Their youngest patient is aged 13 months old. T1 Diams teaches the patients how to live with their health condition and also interact s with and support other family me mbers, relatives and even neighbours. She also pointed out issues that certain families have to face when the patient is still a minor. For instance, the parent - more often than not , the mother - has to quit her job to constantly look after her diabetic child. For families already living in dire conditions, the situation is even more complicated. Hence, T 1 Diams supports these families in view to enable th em to be resilient to such ch allenges. 4.6.8.3.7. Mouvement d'Aide \u00e0 la Maternit\u00e9 (MAM) Sister Solange intervened on behalf of MAM . She explained that this NGO accompanies future mothers during their pregnancy, including adolescents. They also work towards prevention of teenage pregn ancy. Many pedagogical and psychological activities are organised. One special session entitled \"Maman Soleil\" is aimed at training future/young parents . 4.6.8.3.8. Lovebridge Ms Yen Mee, District Coordinator at Lovebridge, explained the NGO's mission at reducing poverty, by helping families to be self -sufficient . She detailed the pillars on which their work rests, namely, education, housing, health, employment/employability, food and nutrition , and MASCO (Motivation, Attitude, Skills and Courage). Lovebri dge also makes sure that children are attending school. Ms Yen Mee highlighted the fact that children from poor families often do not attend kindergarten, and as a Ms Auroomoogum explaining how T 1 Diams support Type1 Diabetic patients Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 151 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 result , there is a gap in education when they start primary school. Furthermore, Lovebridge help s in small renovation s of houses, and in providing small financial assistance in obtaining houses from NHDC. The NGO also assist families in debt by explaining how to manage budgets, as well as in completing formalities for social aid. 4.6.8.4. Voice of R\u00e9sidence Anoska There could not have been a networking forum focused on a community without giving its residents the opportunity to voice out their concerns and views . To strengthen the ties among the different stakeholders in child protection, the floor was opened to community members of R\u00e9sidence Anoska several times throughout the forum to allow them to express themselves freely. One of the common recurring points made was that often NGOs work within R\u00e9sidence Anoska without consul ting with the Association pour le D \u00e9veloppement de R\u00e9sidence Anoska (ADRA) . Whilst there are existing projects in the locality, only a handful of persons seem to benefit from it, and it i s unclear where the funding is being routed to. There are further pro jects that can be realised ; however, it must be agreed with ADRA . Mr Pierre Louis, Community Leader, appealed that the community centre in R\u00e9sidence Anoska should be used as a central figure for any actions in the locality, instead of having projects being dispersed across the region. Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 152 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 Another issue that was constantly pointed out was housing problems. Mr Pierre Louis reminded the officers present that La Pipe residents were already owner of their respective houses, before moving to R\u00e9sidence Anoska. He stated that the NEF should revi ew their funding requirements to help the community. A community member highlighted on the issues involved when several heirs inherit one house. The very process of division -in-kind before a Notary Public is costly and lengthy and hence is hardly envisaged wh en the family is already in precarious conditions. One resident pointed out that h e prioritised his savings for the education of his children over the completion of his house. Currently he lacks the funds to complete the construction of his house. Ms Jogessur assured him that NEF could potentially assist him in his project. Ms Bignoux proposed that the To strengthen the ties among the different stakeholders in child protection, it was vital to give the community members of R\u00e9sidence Anoska the opportunity to voice out their concerns and views freely. Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 153 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 previous Central Housing Authority (CHA) model could be reintegrated to provi de adequate and tailored housing facilities to the needy. An additional issue highlighted by various residents is that of stigmatisation of the inhabitants of R\u00e9sidence Anoska. A community participant, explained how he thought this social stigma resulted in difficulties in obtaining state social aid as they were being constantly looked down upon. He requested NEF and NGOs to accompany the residents to the concerned Ministries to complete formalities for registration purposes. Echoing the same problem, anot her resident shared that she was refused a job as soon as she gave her home address as being R\u00e9sidence Anoska . Additionally, a child professional proposed that public officers should be professional ly trained on how to communicate with people asking for st ate assistance. An additional issue highlighted by various residents is that of stigmatisation of the inhabitants of R\u00e9sidence Anoska.

Bilan of the networking forum The networking forum had overall been a positive and novel way to strengthen the relations between different stakeholders involved in child protection. Every participant in this platform was treated equally. Everyone had fun as well as worked hard to identify issues and find potential solutions . One could see the willingness of organisations (governmental and non -governmental) to make R\u00e9sidence Anoska a better place . The warmth and talents of the residents were praiseworthy. Mr Bawamia, OCO 's Investigator, pointed out that , whilst it is usually observed that women show more involve ment in child - related activities, it was refreshing to see that the men of R\u00e9sidence Anoska felt equally concerned about their children's future. The networking f orum was not only informative, but interac tive and engaging, where each participant felt valued and listened to. Mr Pierre Louis appreciated the various exceptional moments the community members had witnessed and experienced during the forum and requested to all the participants to show the same s olidarity back in R\u00e9sidence Anoska . Similarly, a community member hoped that the momentum of the forum does not stop and expands. The OC remarked that the people of R\u00e9sidence Anoska had proven that they have \" l'esprit communautaire \" and that they do engage in participative democracy. Indeed, as Mr Maurer , from the NGO Safire, said, building human relations is a constant work of collaboration and solidarity of each and everyone. The networking forum was not only informative, but interactive and engaging, where each participant felt valued and listened to. Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 155 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 4.7. A dissemination event on the highlights of the forum In line with the objectives of the networking f orum, it was important to disseminate the key information and outcomes that emerged fro m this initiative, and to announce the way forward. Hence, the OC, along with five community members from R\u00e9sidence Anoska61, held a press conference on 20 August 2020 at the OCO. T he important points of the forum as well as underlying issues regarding chi ld protection were presented to journalists. The OC also deliberat ed on a plan of action regarding a holistic approach to better protect children's rights , that was established by key stakeholders following the 2 - day networking forum. Mr J. L. Pierre Louis, Community Leader , used this opportunity to underscore pertinent issues that affect the daily livelihood of the residents of R\u00e9sidence Anoska . He stated that, \" there are not only bad things happening in R\u00e9sidence Anoska, we have posit ive things too and it is unfortunate that people do not 61 The community members present at the press confe rence were Ms Marie Juliette Beguthe and Mr Ricall Pierre Louis . Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 156 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 talk much about it\" . The other representatives of R\u00e9sidence Anoska also voiced out their concerns and highlighted that the inhabitants of their locality are stigmatised due to the fact that the area i s often portrayed negatively in the media. Two articles regarding this press meeting were published in Le D\u00e9fi Quotidien of 21 August 2020 and 5-Plus Dimanche of 23 August 2020 respectively (refer to Appendix H). \"It is important to act in collaboratio n with the people and to make decisions wit h respect for human dignity. This is a community approach such that we will work for the children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska, but not without the members of this community .\" ~ R. Venkatasawmy, Ombudsperson for Children Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 157 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 4.8. The way forward Following the 2 -day networking forum and the press conference, four further initiatives, as described below, were announced by the OC in terms of the way forward. 4.8.1. A cleaning campaign in R\u00e9sidence Anoska Sustainable development an d the right to a healthy environment are intrinsically linked. If one wishes to promote development and welfare of children, it is essential to start by providing a safe and clean environment for them to live in. The OC proposed that a cleaning campaign wi ll be organised in R\u00e9sidence Anoska with the collaboration of multiple stakeholders. 4.8.2. Continued collaboration with R\u00e9sidence Anoska There will be a consolidation of the works being carried out by different associations in R\u00e9sidence Anoska in a bid to empower its residents. The OCO w ill continue to meet the residents to assess the progress made at regular intervals , and also to pursue and further the collaborative work started with the community. 4.8.3. Conducting a rights -based survey at R\u00e9sidence Anoska In the press briefing, the OC announced that a survey would be carried out to gather qualitative and quantitative data on the families and children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska . Every household of the locality would be invited to participate on a v oluntary basis and upon informed consent. One aim of this enquiry was to make an assessment on how the rights of children are being protected and promoted according to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child within this locality. Rio Declaration on Environment and Development (United Nations, 1992 ), Principle 1 Human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable development. They are entitled to a healthy and productive life in harmony with nature. Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 158 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 At the time of writ ing this report, the survey had already been carried out from 26 to 28 August 2020. A team of the OCO, under the supervision of the Ombudsperson for Children, collected valuable information on around 77 families in R\u00e9sidence Anoska. This survey was also an opportunity for all those who had not been part of the networking forum to be listened to by the OCO's staff members on their concerns regarding their locality and to propose their ideas on how the living conditions of their children and families could be improved. As shown in the pictures on this page, the team of the OCO picked up their materials before proceeding for the data collection in R\u00e9sidence Anoka . This exercise, led by the Ombudsperson for Children, enabled the team to listen actively and collect relevant information from each family interviewed. The OC strongly believes that the information gathered will be an indispensable basis to establishing a long - term action plan.

They added that other students of their schools made fun of them and their locality. Such data are crucial in the formulation of an action plan for the children and young people of the region. The OC thanks Mr Pierre Louis, Community Leader, and three other community members of R\u00e9sidence Anoska - Ms Marie Juliette and Ms Odile - for the ir support throughout data collection. 4.8.4. A Special Report on R\u00e9sidence Anoska Finally, it is planned that a Special Report will be written and publis hed by the OCO on R\u00e9sidence Anoska . This report will be based on the survey carried out with the inha bitants (refer to sub -section 4.8.3) and will aim at analysing issues identified within the community in a child rights -driven, evidence - based and objective manner . This document could also be used as a reference by both governmental Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 161 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 and non -governmental organisations to enable them to plan and design projects or measures that can best assist the specific needs of the community members. Hence, this can effectively co ntribute to the development and empowerment of the children and families of R\u00e9sidence Anoska. \"There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about.\" ~ Margaret Wheatley Strengthening the Safety Net for Children of R\u00e9sidence Anoska | 162 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 The COVID -19 Confinement & Children's Rights | 163 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 CHAPTER 5 Children's Rights in the Context of Homelessness: The Case of Squatter Children in Pointe aux Sables and Riambel \"Building capacity for dialogue and mediation can give voice to the marginalized, enhance power, and equip communities with tools and skills t o bring about meaningful change.\" ~ The Office of the Compliance/Advisor Ombudsman, USA Children's Rights in the Context of Homelessness | 164 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Children's Rights in the Context of Homelessness | 165 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 5.1. Introduction 5.1.1. Rationale for an own -motion investigation by the OC on the right to adequate housing Over the past few years, advocating for the right to an adequate standard of living for every child, as enshrined by the UNCRC, has been an ongoing initiative for the Ombudsperson for Children (OC). For instance, in two of her previous annual reports, she brought particular attention and made recommendations regarding the cases of poor living conditions at Cit\u00e9 Tole and Cit\u00e9 Long\u00e8re Blanc and their implications on children's rights (OC, 2017, chapter 3)62, as well as the impact of residing in asbestos house s and deplorable buildings on children's well -being (OC, 2018, chapter 6)63, respectively. Living in decent housing conditions is one of the fundamental components of children's right to an adequate standard of living. This year, an issue that places at r isk children's right to adequate housing, namely squatting , required significant attention. The OC believed that it was crucial to enquire on the situation of children who were living in squatting conditions in order to assess how their rights were being a ffected and to promote their safety and well -being. In addition, the OC noted that, although the media and other civil society organisations regularly report on their observed number of squatters in a given region and on the experiences of squatters, it is important to highlight that there is a significant lack of formal, quantitative and disaggregated data on the squatter population, and thematic documentation on the issue of squatting in our country . On 25 May 2020, the OC initiated an own -motion investi gation, as per section 7(1) of the Ombudsperson for Children Act 2003 (refer to Appendix A), to enquire on the situation of children who were living in families who were squatting on State lands . The scope of this enquiry, which lasted 3 months, was limite d to squatter children living in the regions of Pointe aux Sables and Riambel in order 62 Ombudsperson for Children (2017).

It is expected that this investigation will be replicated in a second phase to squatter children residing in other a reas of the Republic of Mauritius. It is also important to note that the said investigation was initiated on an OWN -MOTION basis by the OC, and was NOT COMPLAINT -DRIVEN. At no point in time, the OC received formally registered complaints made by squatter f amilies, or by non -governmental organisations (NGOs) or members of the civil society advocating on their behalf, concerning violations of the rights of squatter children. In this chapter, the OC firstly appreciates the importance of the right to adequate housing for every child. She then attempts to provide some clarification on the phenomena of homelessness and squatting, as well as describes these terms within our local context. Next, she details on the objectives, target group, procedures and findings o f the own -motion investigation. Finally, she proposes recommendations that could contribute to improving the situation of homeless children and their families. 5.1.2. The importance of the right of children to adequate housing The United Nations (2009, p. 3)64 explained that the fundamental human right to adequate housing must be regarded in a broad way as the \"right to live somewhere in security, peace and dignity\". A good, warm and safe home is crucial to all aspects of children's well -being, yet a signif icant number of children in certain regions of the world, including parts of the Republic of Mauritius, are having to cope with waking up every day in deplorable housing conditions. Research has shown that children's development, and current and future li fe chances can be largely affected by the quality of their housing. For example, in the United Kingdom, it is known that \"poor housing conditions increase the risk of severe ill -health or disability by up to 25 per cent during childhood and early adulthood \" (Shelter, 2006)65. Shelter (2006) also provided an overview of several negative effects of low -quality housing on children's physical health, mental health, education and opportunities in adulthood, which included respiratory problems, anxiety, depressio n, school absenteeism, 64 United Nations (2009).

In relation to poverty reduction and the creation of sustainable cities and communities, countries of the wo rld are working towards the achievement by 2030 of various targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1 and 11 respectively, of which two are quoted below (United Nations Development Programme [UNDP], 2020)66: \"reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions\" (under SDG 1); and \"ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services and upgrade slums\" (under SDG 11). The Republic of Mauritius is no exception and the State has the prime duty to address poor quality housing and homelessness as a key component in tackling poverty. The Committee on the Rights of the Child (200667, 201568) welcomed the continued effo rts of our country towards poverty alleviation, for instance, the provision of meals, free transport and education to children. However, the Committee (2006) expressed concerns about the \"living conditions of vulnerable groups particularly with regards to access to adequate housing , education and health -care facilities\" . They recommended that our country \"strengthen [s] its efforts to ensure that the needs of all children are met , in particular those from socially disadvantaged families and those living in r emote areas, so that they do not live in poverty and their rights to adequate housing , education and health are respected \" (Ibid., 2006). In light of the above, it is primordial that all relevant stakeholders undertake appropriate actions to improve housi ng conditions for the wellbeing of all children of our Republic. If the right to safe and decent housing is not respected, this will inevitably hinder our children from enjoying a wide range of their other rights, such as their rights to education, health, social security, privacy and so on.

Homelessness and squatting: Multi -faceted phenome na 5.1.3.1. Understanding the term 'homelessness' There is no universal definition of homelessness, and interpretation of this phenomenon varies across countries based on their different legal, economic, social and cultural contexts. In a general sense, homelessness may be considered as \" the inability of people to enjoy a permanent accommodation\" (Salcedo, 2019)69. The United Nations Statistics Division (as cited in Human Rights Council, 2015)70 further breaks down homelessness into two categories: \"primar y homelessness\" , as persons living on the streets or without a shelter or living quarters71; and \"secondary homelessness\" as including persons with no place of usual residence. Persons in the latter category mainly include those who move frequently betwee n various types of accommodation such as dwellings, shelters or other living quarters; those who reside in long -term 'transitional' shelters or similar arrangements for the homeless; or those living in private dwellings, but who do not report a usual addre ss on administrative forms (Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights [OHCHR], 2012)72. Leilani Farha (2015)73, a Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing, proposed three dimensions that can be used to better define homelessness from a hu man rights perspective, as illustrated below: 69 Salcedo, J.

Children's Rights in the Context of Homelessness | 169 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Within the Republic of Mauritius, there is currently no statutory or legal definition of 'homelessness'. For the State to support individuals and families in poverty situations with housing vulnerability, they need to figure on the Social Register of Mauri tius (SRM) - \"a computer -based application to register and identify the poor and their socioeconomic profile\" (Government Information Service, 2019)74 - which is maintained by the Ministry of Social Integration, Social Security and National Solidarity. Those who are eligible under the SRM can also apply for a housing unit through the National Housing Development Co. Ltd, which operates under the aegis o f the Ministry of Housing and Land Use Planning. 5.1.3.2. Contextualising the term 'squatting' According to a description proposed by the Global Informality Project (2019)75, squatting can be referred to as \"informal housing whereby, for a variety of exis tential, legal, political and ideological reasons, people settle on vacant land or occupy abandoned buildings, both private and public. People who squat possess no legal title to land or building, pay no rent for the respective property and live there with out any formal entitlement\" . Similar to the term 'homelessness', the term 'squatting' may have 74 Government Information Service (2019).

Dimension 2: A form of systemic discrimination and social exclusion, whereby \"the homeless\" become a social group subject to stigmatization. Dimension 3: Homeless people as resilient in the struggle for survival and dignity and potential agents of change as rights holders. Children's Rights in the Context of Homelessness | 170 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children different definitions based on specific contexts, and the group of people identified as 'squatters' may also be known by other names, such as informal settlers o r illegal tenants. In the Republic of Mauritius, the issue of squatting is not a new phenomenon, and has remained an ongoing challenge to the authorities and other relevant stakeholders for decades. According to section 22 of the State Lands Act 1982, the term 'squatter' designates a person who takes possession of, encroaches upon, cultivate or put up any building or other structure on any part of any State land without the express authorisation in writing of the Minister . A squatter who fails to vacate St ate land after having been served a notice commits an offence under this law and he/she becomes liable to evictions, fines, and/or even imprisonment. Therefore, in our country, the term 'squatter' is mostly used in the context of illegal occupancy of State lands. For the purpose of this chapter, a few working definitions for terms related to 'squatting' have been proposed below, in an attempt to retain their link to the above -mentioned local legal definition of a squatter, and to enhance their connection w ith human rights. Squatter First and foremost, a squatter is a human being who is a holder of human rights and fundamental freedoms. In the exercise of his/her rights, he/she also has the responsibility to respect the rights of others. Locally, a person is considered to be a squatter when he/she unlawfully occupies a vacant land that is owned by the State. Squatter children Squatter children refer to persons under the age of 18 years old who live with their parents or caregivers within squatting conditions. In theory, squatter children have the same fundamental rights as any other children. However, owing to their exceptional circumstances, they cannot or do not enjoy many, or even all, of these rights. Research studies commonly show that they st ruggle in unhygienic settlements, experience poverty, are at risk of being victims of abuse at 'home' and at school, and may develop psychological difficulties such as low self -esteem, anxiety and challenging behaviour. Children's Rights in the Context of Homelessness | 171 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Squatter camp A squatter camp can be understood as an area where a group of individuals, including children, unlawfully occupy vacant land owned by the State. Within this informal settlement, the squatters usually erect tents, or small buildings with cardboard, wood, iron sheets or scrap m aterial. These built structures are generally unequipped with basic amenities such as water and electric supply, and sewerage systems. Squatter camps are hazardous environments that expose its residents to a number of risks to their safety and well -being. They represent a threat to the fulfillment of the basic needs and fundamental rights of human beings, with children being the most vulnerable. In the course of her investigation, the OC was frequently asked the following questions regarding the term 'squ atting', which she attempted to clarify as follows: Is 'squatter' a derogatory term? The term 'squatter' is used in many countries including the Republic of Mauritius to designate an individual who engages in illegal occupancy of unused public or private buildings or land. The OC believes that the term itself is not derogatory and is only a word to refer to a group of vulnerable people with specific characteristics. However, the stigma attached to the squatter population might be an underlying reas on why they could be subject to derogatory remarks or disrespectful attitudes from others. It is important that relevant stakeholders promote the human rights and dignity of squatters and protect them from all forms of discrimination. Are the terms 'home less' and 'squatter' the same? There are both overlaps and distinctions between a homeless individual and a squatter. Given that a homeless person does not have any permanent accommodation, he/she may choose to temporarily inhabit an unused building or co nstruct a small structure on a vacant piece of land without any formal agreement with the legitimate owner. In this case, the homeless person can also be referred to as a squatter. On the other hand, if a squatter illegally occupies an unused building or p iece of land, despite legitimately owning or renting a building or piece of land somewhere else, he/she cannot be called a homeless person. Simply said, not all homeless people become squatters and not all squatters are actually homeless. Children's Rights in the Context of Homelessness | 172 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children How can we disti nguish 'genuine' and a 'fake' squatter? A 'genuine' squatter is expected to be a person who does not already own or lease any property or land, that is, he/she is homeless, and who illegally lives on a vacant property or land, with or without their families, as a last resort, mainly due to helplessness and an inability to financially afford an alternative accommodation. On the contrary, a 'fake' squatter is an individual who already owns or rents a property or land for residential purposes, and w ho intentionally occupies another land or property not entitled to them, most commonly State land, with or without their families, as a means to fraudulently acquire social housing benefits from the State. He/she pursues his/her self -interests by ignoring the rule of law and abusing of his/her human rights. The 'fake squatter' profile tends to be the one that disproportionately contributes to the stigma often associated with the squatter population. As far as children are concerned, irrespective of whether their parents are 'fake' or 'genuine' squatters, the difficulties they experience are relatively similar. Can children of squatters be taken away by the authority? Undoubtedly, children are the most to suffer within squatting conditions. 'Genuine' squa tter parents unintentionally expose their children to a wide host of harmful risks, while 'fake' squatter parents purposely put their children through this precarious situation. In any case, it is crucial to be aware that this can qualify as a form of chil d ill-treatment, abuse or neglect, and section 13(1) of the Child Protection Act (CPA) 1994 provides that, \"[a]ny person who ill -treats a child or otherwise exposes a child to harm shall commit an offence.\" If the responsible authority, that is the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family Welfare, as represented by the Child Development Unit (CDU), has reasonable ground to believe that a squatter child is suffering or is likely to suffer significant harm, he/she may request t hrough the Court an Emergency Protection Order (CPA 1994, section 4) or a Committal Order to a place of safety (CPA 1994, section 8) for that child. Upon issue of any of the above -named Court Orders, the children in need of protection will be taken away fr om the squatter parents by the CDU without legally needing their consent. Children's Rights in the Context of Homelessness | 173 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 5.2. Conducting the own -motion investigation The current section outlines the objectives, the target group, investigation procedures and findings of the OC's own -motion investigation. 5.2.1. Objectives of the investigation The objectives of this enquiry were to estimate reliably the number of squatter families with children in the visited regions; identify issues that affect squatter children's right to adequate housing , and impact on their development and well -being; and propose recommendations to relevant stakeholders on how to promote and protect the right to adequate housing of squatter children, along with other associated rights. 5.2.2. Target group As explained i n the introductory section 5.1.1 of the current chapter, the OC focussed on squatter children who were living with their families on State lands located at Pointe aux Sables and Riambel . 5.2.3. Investigation procedures Various methods, as listed below, were employed by the OC and her team to gather relevant information regarding squatter families and their children from multiple sources over a 3 -month period: (1) Field visits were carried out in both Pointe aux Sables and Riambel to conduct observati ons and interviews with squatter families. (2) Meetings were organised with different stakeholders at the OCO. (3) Investigators of the OCO attended meetings at the Ministry of Housing and Land Use Planning. Children's Rights in the Context of Homelessness | 174 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children (4) A written request was made to several non-governmental organisations (NGOs) working with squatter children to provide: (i) their latest figures on the number of squatter families that they had identified who have one or more children; (ii) a list of hardship cases of squatter families with children wh om they encountered during their work and who were not eligible for benefitting from the facilities of the National Empowerment Foundation (NEF) and/or National Housing Development Co. (NHDC) Ltd; and (iii) the number of members in their NGOs who held qualificat ions, and specialised training and experience in social welfare and support. (5) Squatter children were interviewed. (6) Local articles published in the press that related to squatter families and their children were analysed. (7) Desk research was carried out to b etter understand the issue of squatting, problems faced by squatters and the impact of squatting on children's rights and well -being. (8) A letter with a list of recommendations related to squatter children was sent to the Ministry of Housing and Land Use Pla nning. (9) Close contact with the said Ministry and a network of reliable informants (who wish to remain anonymous) was maintained throughout the investigation process. As part of one of the investigation procedures outlined above, the OC met with squatter families of Pointe aux Sables who were invited at the OCO to present their concerns on the protection of their children. Below is an extract of a dialogue (translated t o English from Mauritian Creole) between the OC and these families, that highlighted important issues including, advocacy for children's rights, access Children's Rights in the Context of Homelessness | 175 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children to housing, the harm caused by self -appointed advocates and 'fake' squatters, and the need to empower th ese families through human rights education. OC Welcome to my office. I am glad that you accepted my invitation to attend this meeting. I feel honoured to meet you all because you are resilient citizens who are fighting for your survival and that of you r children. Families We are also happy to meet you. You do not know us, but we do. We often listen to your interventions on radio and read your comments in newspapers. Now, we expect that you use your influence to fight for the rights of our children. We need an NHDC house or a plot of land on lease where we can build our own houses for the welfare of our kids. Just the plot of land, Madam Rita...the rest we will manage. There are many available NHDC houses and enough available land! OC I und erstand your concerns, but matters are not that simple and straight forward. There are so many people who have requested for NHDC houses. They have children as well and many of them have applied to the NHDC before you. You cannot skip the queue. Families Please Madam Rita, you must protect our children. We trust you. OC I will definitely write a report on the rights of squatter children, but I cannot promise that you will get a house or a plot of land. Families Please do something for us and our children. We trust you. OC I appreciate the trust you have in me, but as the OC, I can only make recommendations. I cannot action my recommendations. I will advocate for the rights of your children, but I cannot make false promises to you. Families Plea se come to visit us. OC I promise I will. Families Why did you personally not come to visit us at the squatter camps earlier? OC I did not come personally yet, which I will do very soon. But you might have already met with Investigators of the OCO whom I had delegated to carry out field visits since the confinement period. It is also important for you to know that I work within a le gal framework and I have to investigate first, then make recommendations. An investigation is a scientific process which means that I have to check and counter -check any information Children's Rights in the Context of Homelessness | 176 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children collected. I cannot afford to make statements without having reliable fact s and figures. Since the beginning, I have been trying my level best to analyse and understand the bigger picture of children living in squatter camps at Pointe aux Sables and Riambel. It does not mean that I have not been doing my work because I did not m eet you personally. Families We have now a better understanding on your role. It is important to listen to what squatter families have to say. OC I must admit that the presence of 'fake' squatters in your midst has delayed our meeting. During the initial phase of our investigation, we came across many 'fake' squatters who were, at times, more proactive than 'genuine' ones. Please understand that, as the OC, I have to get my figures right. Imagine that I talk in my work about 80+ squatter families in Point e aux Sables, which include 'fake' ones, will this not have caused prejudice to families who are 'genuine' squatters? Families We totally agree with you that there was a critical mass of 'fake' squatters in the beginning. They have left the squatter camps progressively, but they have caused much harm to our cause. OC I would also like you to take note that certain self -appointed advocates of squatter families have also done disservice to your cause by being aggressive and using violent language to fight for your cause. But they ended up fighting...not necessarily for your rights. You need to be sensitised on human and children's rights. A human rights activist is a person who individually or in collaboration with others acts to promote or protect human rights. There are 'genuine' human rights activists and 'fake' ones! Families Like squatters! OC Yes! The United Nations recognises the importance of genuine human rights activists/defenders. In addition to receiving support from NGOs and civil societ y representatives, you also need to be empowered so that you can advocate for yourself and your children. My office will soon organise a workshop which can help you better understand your rights and responsibilities. Families Thank you, Madam. Many thanks to your staff. We appreciate that you have listened to our concerns. Children's Rights in the Context of Homelessness | 177 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Within the above extract, it can be noted that, at one point, families asked the OC why she did not personally come to meet them at the squatter camps initially. They seemed to be ass uming that only those who came to see them in person were actually supporting them. However, after the explanation of the OC, they acknowledged that the latter and her team had been enquiring on their situation during all that time, and she had been active ly gathering information from various sources to better advocate for squatter children's rights and make their voices heard at the level of the Ministry of Housing and Land Use Planning. They also understood that the OC works within the remit of the Ombuds person for Children Act 2003 and this law allows her to investigate matters related to children's rights \"in such manner as [s]he considers appropriate\" (OCA 2003, section 7(1)). In the present case, the OC initially focussed on the use of soft power (refe r to the textbox on the next page) to influence decision -making processes of relevant stakeholders with regards to the rights of squatter children. Soft Power One of the specific features of the Ombudsperson for Children's Office , that is distinct from the Court and other control mechanisms , is its non -coercive soft powers with no authority to sanction. The recommendations of the Ombudsperson for Children are neither binding nor enforceable , but the use of persuasion and moral authority enc ourages the public or private authorities , or other parties concerned, to review their position or decision on issues relating to child ren's rights. As pointed out by Reif (2004)76, (...) ombudsman effectiveness does not always follow automatically from ha ving stronger enforcement powers (...) the non -coercive soft powers of an ombudsman can constitute strength and one source of its effectiveness, connected with other factors such as the character and authority of the ombudsman and the government's positive support. The O mbudsperson for Children provides functional and practical feedback either to Ministers or to public or private bodies so that possible solutions and reforms are considered in connection with children's rights, and that standards of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child are applied rigorously when handling child -related issues. 76 Reif, L.

Children's Rights in the Context of Homelessness | 178 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 5.2.4. Findings 5.2.4.1. Information on State measures undertaken related to the problem of squatting over the past two decades During the investigation, information was collated from governmental sources on measures that had been undertaken by the ministry responsible for housing and land use over the past two decades. This was necessary because the onus remains mainly on the State to support the most vulnerable groups of people, mainl y children, and guarantee that everyone's housing is adequate, by involving all the relevant stakeholders from the public and private sectors. The following table contains a summary of data gathered by the OCO, presented in the order of the year associated with the measures or figures: Year Summary of measures and/or figures reported in relation to squatting by the ministry responsible for housing and land use 2004 In 2004, a government policy was introduced towards regularising pre -July 2001 residential squatters (illegal occupations) by the grant of building site leases expiring in the year 2060 (Ministry of Housing and Lands [MHL], 2014)77 2014 Some 2,700 squatters had been regularised over a period of 10 years (i.e. from 2004 to 2014) and became holders of long -term formal leases over the sites occupied (MHL, 2014). They were also given wooden and corrugated iron sheets for free (MHL, 2014). 2015 As at 01 July 2015, 1,104 squatters were identified (Ministry of Housing and Land Use Planning [MHLUP], 2020)78 On 02 September 2015, the then Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Housing and Lands affirmed at the National Assembly that the \" Government is bent on addressing 77 Ministry of Housing and Land s (2014).

In September 2015, out of the 1,104 squatters who were identified as at 01 July 2015, 654 had been regularis ed on squatted or other sites (MHLUP, 2020). 2017 65 housing units were constructed at Pointe aux Sables to relocate squatters occupying land earmarked for the Ring Road project at Tranquebar (MHLUP, 2020). 2019 From 01 June 2015 to the end of 2019, around 300 squatters had been identified (MHLUP, 2020). 2020 During the lockdown period, some 160 squatters were identified, out of whom 150 have been removed (MHLUP, 2020). As at 01 July 2020, 450 squatters (out of the 1,104 squatters identified as at 01 July 2015) had not yet been regularised due to being considered as difficult cases (MHLUP, 2020). The MHLUP (2020) has initiated a multi -sectoral survey to identify genuine cases of squatters. The MHLUP (2020) has given th e assurance that it is committed to promoting equity and inclusiveness in providing sustainable housing for vulnerable groups including the homeless and eligible squatters. In reference to the table above, it can be seen that governmental initiatives to re gularise identified squatters have been ongoing since 2004. Nevertheless, it can be noted that new cases of squatters kept emerging over time. 79 Government Information Service (2015). Residential squatting is being addressed with rigour and humanity, says Vice - Prime Minister Soodhun . Retrieved on 01 September 2 020 in the Context of Homelessness | 180 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 5.2.4.2. The dilemma of housing for all Many of the squatters who were evicted from State lands argued that the y were unable to make the 10 per cent down payment to contribute to the total cost of an NHDC house. They did not have a \"Plan Epargne Logement\" , which is a saving plan operated by the Mauritius Housing Company Ltd (2020)80 in order for clients, especially youths, to acquire or construct a house in the future. Some of them also told the OCO that they were not eligible for support from the NEF. The Ministry of Housing and Land Use Planning has emphasised that squatter families who have just recently register ed with the NHDC cannot be given priority over those who registered much before them. In this context, a recurring question asked by many of these families was how would their children survive in the long run? 5.2.4.3. Squatting: A cross -cutting issue amo ng different ministries and statutory bodies The OC would like to underline that the issue of squatters, in particular that of squatter children, does not only concern the Ministry of Housing and Land Use Planning (MHLUP), but also the Ministries of: Gender Equality and Family Welfare (MGEFW); Education, Tertiary Education, Science and Technology (METEST); and Social Integration, Social Security and National Solidarity (MSISSNS). In fact, all these Ministries play an important role in the development and protection of squatter children. For instance, the METEST ensures that all children, including squatter children, have access to free primary and secondary education without any discrimination. Secondly, the Child Development Unit (CDU) of the MGEFW is monitoring closely the whereabouts of squatter children and will be ready to intervene if the need arises. In addition, the National Empowerment Foundation (NEF), under the aegis of the MSISSNS, is actively working towards the welfare of squatter childre n in collaboration with the MHLUP. Squatters who qualify for support provided by the NEF are being identified on a regular basis. The NEF can propose services to homeless and squatter children, provided that their families are eligible under the Social 80 Mauritius Housing Company Ltd (2020).

Scoping the profile of 'genuine' squatter families their children at Pointe aux Sables and Riambel 5.2.4.4.1. Initial difficulties in data collection During the initial phase of the investigation, the OC realised that it was very difficult to determine the exact number of genuine squatter families with children at Pointe aux Sables and Riambel, which seemed to be rapidly changing with the influx and out flux of squatters at different points in time in these regions. For instance, the OCO's Investigators observed that, from 26 May 2020 to 27 May 2020, there was an increase in structures built at Pointe aux Sables overnight. 81 T.

Children's Rights in the Context of Homelessness | 182 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 5.2.4.4.2. Figures related to the profile of squatter families and children Based on the OCO's observations and information gathered up to 25 September 2020, some figures related to the profile of squatter families, deemed to be 'genuine' cases, and children living in squatter camps l ocated at Pointe aux Sables and Riambel respectively are provided follows: POINTE SABLES 1. Sixteen squatter families , mostly female -headed, were found to be living under tents at Pointe aux Sables. 2. Eleven of these families had children living with them at the squatter camps. 3. There were 17 children in all , aged between 10 months and 16 years . 4. Six of the 11 families with children had already registered with the NHDC previously and are on the list to get a house by the end of the year. 5. The remaining 5 families with children have just recently registered with the NHDC and have joined the queue for the acquisition of a house. RIAMBEL 1. Six squatter families with children were identified at Riambel. 2. There were 10 children in all , aged between 2 months and 15 years . 3. These 6 families with children have just recently registered with the NHDC and have joined the queue for the acquisition of a house.

A notable absence of fathers in the lives of squatter children It was observed that most of the squatter families at Pointe aux Sables and Riambel were female - headed. Child care was mainly being carried out by single mothers, including young ones. Owing to their economic vulnerability, the absence of fathers in the fa mily made it significantly challenging for these mothers to find a job or be supported in meeting the needs of the children. Some of the children had never met their fathers, while others were not even declared by the father at birth. Growing up without a father can have adverse long -term effects on the development and psychological well -being of the concerned children, even more so when the father is unknown. This can be considered as a non -respect of the right of the child to an identity, which is clearly stipulated in article 7(1) of the UNCRC: \"The child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from birth to a name, the right to acquire a nationality and, as far as possible, the right to know and be cared for by his or her par ents.\" Children's Rights in the Context of Homelessness | 184 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 5.2.4.4.4. Education of the children With regards to education, most of the squatter children attended schools. However, the rate of absenteeism was quite high among this category of children. Both at Pointe aux Sables and Riambel, parents informed OCO's Investigators that their children had difficulties coping with the school programme, mainly because of their deplorable living conditions and family distress. The squatter camps were not conducive to learning and they did not have a proper area wher e they could do their homework. 5.2.4.5. Deplorable living situation of the squatter families and children 5.2.4.5.1. Poverty Many squatters stated to the OC that they were living in extreme poverty. Some of the adults said that they had no other option t han to live in tents because they had lost their jobs during the COVID -19 lockdown. Others were unemployed since a long time. All of them claimed that they had very limited resources. 5.2.4.5.2. Physical environments unfit for living The squatter camps were visibly unfit physical environments for the daily living of the squatters. There were limited washroom facilities. On rainy days, there was water leakage in the tents, which caused significant inconvenience to children and their families. During a field visit, squatter families informed an OCO's Investigator that some well -wishers from the neighbourhood at times offered accommodation to infants, especially on rainy and very cold nights. At both squatter camps in Pointe aux Sables and Riambel, lit ter could be found everywhere, and stray dogs were roaming around. 5.2.4.5.3. Risks to the safety and psychological well -being of children Squatter families of both areas, who spoke with the OC and Investigators, were very concerned and worried about the safety of their children. Their children often witnessed violence within the squatter camps, and, at times, they got into physical and verbal fights with other squatters. In addition, the families reported that their children were being exposed to people w ho were smoking cigarettes, and consuming alcohol and drugs, at or in the vicinity of the squatter camps. The OC and her team Children's Rights in the Context of Homelessness | 185 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children additionally observed that some children appeared to be left on their own with no supervision from their parents. Furthermore, 'g enuine' squatter families expressed their unhappiness and frustration with the presence of 'fake' squatters. They protested by saying that, particular brought the attention of the OC and her team to the presence of other unknown people who occasionally come to occupy overnight empty tents left by previous families at the squatter camps. For instance, they recounted that some people had attended a concert nearby and they came to sleep in the empty tents that night. In both Pointe aux Sables and Riambel, families reported that sometimes the 'fake' squatters or the random campers behaved inappropriately towards the fam ilies and the children. In addition, they also noted that some of these strangers only came over when donations were being distributed by NGOs and other civil society organisations. Altogether, these precarious conditions could cause squatter children to become victims of different forms of abuse, including sexual abuse and prostitution. These situations could significantly impact on children's physical and mental health, as well as their opportunities in life. 5.2.4.6. The voices of squatter children Children freely expressed themselves on their conditions of living and difficulties they face in their everyday lives. Some of their comments were captured as follows (in Mauritian Creole): \"Dan to say NHDC.] Children's Rights in the Context of Homelessness | 186 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 5.2.4.7. Support provided by NGOs and other civil society members A number of NGOs and other civil society members have rushed to provide support to squatter families, especially since the ir structures have been demolished. Examples of actions carried out were: distribution of food packs; educational and recreational activities for children; regular psychological and counselling support provided by Fondation Cardinal Jean Marg\u00e9ot; the acc ommodation of a group of single mothers at Foyer Fiat; and the setting up of 'Drwa A Enn Lakaz: Platform Sitwayen', a platform regrouping several NGOs and civil society actors to advocate on behalf of squatters to the authorities concerned. Although the dynamism and solidarity of these organisations and individuals were commendable, the OC noted a few limitations in relation to some of these support initiatives, as listed below, which could adversely impact on the promotion and protection of squatter children's rights: At times, it was observed that there was a lack of coordination among the organisations and individuals, which resulted into confusions and diverging interpretations of the actual needs and experiences of the squatter families and their children. Some organisations who were offering similar support services appeared to be competing among one another, instead of consolidating their actions in the best interests of the squatter families and their children. A few self -appointed adv ocates were observed speaking on behalf of the squatter families and their children, but they actually did not have any training in human and children's rights and/or social welfare and support. Children's Rights in the Context of Homelessness | 187 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 5.3. Recommendations 5.3.1. Clarifying the local definition of 'homelessness' and setting up of a 'specialised homelessness unit' The OC proposes that, as a pre -requisite, the term 'homelessness' must be defined within our local legislation . 'Homelessness' currently has no legal definition within the Republic of M auritius, which can create confusion on identifying who is actually homeless or not. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the Housing Act 1996 and the Homelessness Act 2002 define specifically who can be considered as statutorily homeless . Those who qualif y under this definition are entitled to housing, social, health and psychological services adapted to the needs of this target group. The issue of 'fake' squatters often arises whenever genuine homeless families manifest themselves. A clear definition of a homeless person within our country could help in differentiating between a 'genuine' and a 'fake' squatter, whereby a 'genuine' squatter would fit all the local criteria of statutory homelessness and be eligible to access homeless services. The OC recomm ends the setting up of a specialised homelessness unit by relevant ministries involved in tackling this issue, that could triage, assess and intervene in all registered cases of statutorily homeless people, using a human rights -based framework. Statutorily homeless families with children must be considered a priority group for referral to support services. An ongoing survey that collects disaggregated data on each of these families could be carried out. This information could allow for a more holistic appro ach to intervening with these families. It could also provide valuable information on the number, age groups, gender, education, health and birth registration status of the homeless children, that can aid in the promotion of their fundamental rights. 5.3.2. Supporting homeless families to access adequate housing NGOs and civil society actors who have b een active in supporting squatter families could organise fund - raising activities to contribute towards the acquisition of social housing for genuinely homeless cases. Mauritian citizens living in the country and abroad could also be mobilised to donate money to this cause. The OC appreciates the laudabl e initiative of local artists who performed at a concert on 19 September 2020 to collect funds for homeless families so that they could pay their 10 per cent down Children's Rights in the Context of Homelessness | 188 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children payment for the acquisition of NHDC houses. The OC also advises that part of the money receiv ed during such fund -raising activities could be invested in temporarily renting transitional accommodation, such as private houses or hostels, for these families. This could serve as a rapid and intermediate solution to enable genuine squatter families and their children to access a safe temporary shelter. As a way of participating to their recovery, the concerned families could also be encouraged to provide a nominal contribution to the rent, if they could afford it. 5.3.3. Transparency and accountabilit y in solidarity actions for homeless families The OC recommends that fund -raising and other solidarity actions intended for supporting homeless families must be performed with in a legal framework , through a multi -stakeholder committee involving representat ives from public, private and civil society sectors, including key members from the homeless population, to maintain a high level of transparency and accountability. Uncoordinated and unregulated solidarity actions, especially those involving financial tra nsactions, can become a source of unethical and corruptive practices. Many citizens have contacted the OC O to express their desire to support homeless families financially. However, we could not respond to their queries in the absence of a formalised proce dure to receive financial aids for these families. In fact, t he OCO is not mandated to collect any kind of donation on behalf of vulnerable groups of people. 5.3.4. Preventing the re -emergence of squatters Once the current cohort of squatters are dealt with, and the identified genuine squatter families with children have a safe temporary shelter, the OC believes that it is highly necessary to ensure, with the collaboration of public, private and civil societ y organisations, that no individual or group of people become squatters, especially if they are a family with children . As it has been discussed in sub -section 5.2.4.5 of this chapter, squatter camps are high -risk environments where multiple violations of children's rights take place. It is advised that empty tents or structures on State lands are cleared out to prevent new people from occupying them. As soon as the criteria for statutory homelessness are clearly defined within our law (refer to sub - sectio n 5.3.1), intensive sensitisation campaigns could be carried out to educate the public at large on Children's Rights in the Context of Homelessness | 189 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children who is legally homeless and the specific support services available to this vulnerable group. It must become clear in the minds of people that the 'specialis ed homelessness unit', as proposed in sub - section 5.3.1, would be the only point of entry for access to homeless services. The OC thinks that it is also important to shift the mentality of people on understanding that squatting is illegal and must not be c onsidered as a quicker way of obtaining social housing . The recommendations proposed in sub - sections 5.3.5 to 5.3.9 would apply only to statutorily homeless families and children. 5.3.5. The need for personalised social support plans for homeless families To better protect their children, homeless families do not only need financial resources, but also personalised social support. Tailor -made social support plans are designed with the active collaboration of the beneficiaries and ensure that services provi ded are relevant to their needs. An important aspect of a personalised social support plan is that it builds upon the family's resources, capacities and strengths, and ensure that the family members are the primary decision makers on matters concerning them. The Ombudsperson for Children recommends that the NGO Safire ( Service d'Accompagnement, de Formation, d'Insertion et de R\u00e9habilitation de l'Enfant )82, which has a proven track record since 2006 in the social empowerment and management of children and f amilies living in street situations, could take the lead in designing personalised social support plans with homeless families and their children. While the families are living in transitional accommodation, intensive psychosocial support services could al so be arranged for them to empower them on how to improve their economic conditions and promote the well -being of their children. The National Social Inclusion Foundation (NSIF) could support this NGO financially to set up and implement this project for th e welfare of the homeless families and their children. 82 More details on Safire can be accessed on its website ( safire -ngo.org/welcome/home ). Children's Rights in the Context of Homelessness | 190 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 5.3.6. Parental empowerment within the context of homelessness Homeless children can experience trauma and are at high risk of suffering from social, behavioural, emotional and psychological problem s. The parents of homeless children may become helpless in exercising their authority over their children as they may not be equipped to deal with a child who is developing such problems. Moreover, homelessness conditions exacerbate difficult feelings with in families such as tension, fear, anger and frustration, and the family unit has heightened risks of becoming dysfunctional. In 2005, the Ombudsperson for Children's Office recommended to the then Ministry of Women's Rights, Child Development and Family Welfare to set up a Family/Child Mentoring Programme. In 2008, the Child Protection Act 1994 was amended with the addition of a Child Mentoring Scheme (sections 3A-3F). The amended Act provides for the allocation of a Child Mentor to children who (i) are vict ims of neglect; (ii) suffer from mild behavioural problems; (iii) are in distress; or (iv) have problems of social adaptation. In order to empower homeless parents to exercise parental authority over their children, the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family Welfare coul d identify the children who may have one or more of the above -listed difficulties, and allocate a Child Mentor to each family requiring this service. 5.3.7. Kinship care for homeless children Kinship care is defined as care provided by relatives or close family friends to children who cannot live with their parents. Kinship or informal care is normally arranged without the intervention of any child protection services. In the Republic of Mauritius, it implies that a child would move to another family close to his/her parents without the intervention of the CDU or the foster care department. Parental neglect is a common reason why children may find themselves in kinship care. Although the child lives away from their parents, kinship care can help them maintain a sense of stability and safety, as well as remain connected with their family and cultural norms. Children's Rights in the Context of Homelessness | 191 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Homeless families also entrust their children to kinship care in order to ensure their protection. These parents do not necessary lack the parentin g skills to look after their children. They just do not have the resources to offer a decent accommodation to the latter. During the OC's investigation, she noted that some squatter families at Pointe aux Sables and Riambel had already arranged for the kin ship care of their children for until they had better housing conditions. The OC is of the view that other homeless families with children could be encouraged to choose the option of kinship care within their trusted social networks to protect the best int erests of their children, while they work towards improving their situation. To motivate trusted relatives or friends of homeless families to provide kinship care to their children, the OC thinks that an NGO, with proven experience and skills in alternativ e care and the design of personalised social support plans, could set up an NSIF -funded project to facilitate this process. Needless to say, kinship care should be a temporary measure and children should be reunited with their parents in the shortest delay possible. 5.3.8. Continuous psychological therapies and support to homeless children and their families Being homeless can be a traumatic experience for child ren, that could leave lasting psychological damage and adversely affect their cognitive , emotion al and social development. Governmental institutions in collaboration with NGOs could provide ongoing psychological therapies and support to homeless children and their families , in order to help them overcome the trauma related to their situation and also to prevent or minimise their risk of developing mental health disorders. This service could be coordinated by the 'specialised homelessness unit' (proposed in sub -section 5.3.1) and it could be based within local buildings such as at C itizen Advi ce Bureau x or in c ommunity centres . 5.3.9. Building the educational resilience of homeless children As observed during the OC's investigation, the squatting conditions considerably hindered the school routine and educatio nal progress of homeless children. It is proposed that governmental institutions and NGOs could call upon volunteer and/or retired teachers to provide remedial academic assistance and support to homeless children . This initiative could be carried out in an educational institution after school hours or in community or social centres. Cultural, leisure and recreational activities, which are Children's Rights in the Context of Homelessness | 192 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children important aspects of education, could also be organised by NGOs and sports organisations for the homeless children in or der to improve their overall development and self -esteem. The OC emphasises that educational support to homeless children is a MUST as it is a crucial stepping stone to helping them move out of intergenerational cycles of poverty and homelessness. 5.4. Concluding remarks This own -motion investigation to enquire on the situation of children living in squatter camps at Pointe aux Sables and Riambel was a very difficult and delicate process. Initially, the OC encountered difficulties in identifying credible r epresentatives of squatter families . It was also hard to distinguish between 'fake' and 'genuine' squatter families . Despite these challenges, she made it her duty to listen to the voices of the homeless children and families living at the squatter camps. She firmly believe s that NO DECISION CONCERNING THEM SHOULD BE TAKEN WITHOUT THEM. Furthermore, the OC highlighted the importance for legislating a clear local definition of 'homelessness', and for empowering homeless families to become their own advocates and active agents of change. In this context, the OCO will soon organise workshops to enable them to better understand the concept s of human and children's rights , in collaboration with a local NGO called \" DroItS huMains Oc\u00e9an Indien\" (DIS-MOI)83, which is very active in the field of human rights education. Ultimately, the OC hopes that , an awareness of the risks of squatting to the safety, well -being and rights of their children would enable homeless families to refrain from squatting, but rather seek support from their trusted social networks and the authorities in the best interests o f their children. Finally, she invites NGOs and other civil society representative s to seek guidance from the OCO on matters related to homeless children's rights. 83 More informat ion on DIS -MOI can be found on its website ( dismoi.org ).

Report on Activities 2019 -2020 | 222 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 Universal Children's Day Voices of Children: Voices for Children! The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child selected the theme of \"Children as human rights defenders\" for the 30th Anniversary of the Conven tion on the Rights of the Child . This calls for the international community to reinforce its efforts to put children as their top priority in their agenda by empowering children to become agents of change . As part of this event, children of S afire presented a brief and poignant testimony on how such platforms are influential for the empowerment of their peers . The OC believes that c hildren play a crucial role in this process and embody a powerful and undisputable voice for change. They can provide a valuable and relevant perspective on the reality of a child's life together with meaningful ideas to push forward the children's agenda . Youth testimonies can have a broader and more impactful influence for change when compared to adults lobbying on their behalf, by emphasising realities, feelin gs, apprehensions and most notably deconstructing beliefs and stereotypes! \"Je m'adresse \u00e0 mes amis de chance de r\u00e9ussir .\" (Extract of a child's testimony) Report on Activities 2019 -2020 | 223 Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2019 -2020 Universal Children's Day Any celebration is incomplete without a cake!

Report on Activities 2019 -2020 | 257 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Promoting the rights to be heard and to participate \"The greatest gift we can give to our children is to raise them in a culture of peace.\" ~ Louise Diamond The OC further explained that children have rights, irrespective of age, race, religion and sex, such as the rights to health, education, play and freedom of expression among others. The OC encouraged the participants to voice out as much they can on any harassment or discrimination that they may face at their schools. During this interactive session, she talked about how bullying is a serious issue among young people these days. Bullying at school may take several forms such as physical, sexual, emotional or cyber bullying, and can have long -lasting psychological effects on the bullied. She stressed upon the right for every child to live and study i n a peaceful and secure environment . The OC and the participants discussed on ways to prevent bullying among children. Most of them said that they witnessed some of their friends being bullied at school , especially during recess time, and they thought that this should not happen anymore. They all wished that their school environment could be free from all forms of bullying. Report on Activities 2019 -2020 | 258 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Promoting the rights to be heard and to participate As part of the session , the OC engaged with the participants about the definition, causes, consequences and health risks of teenage pregnancy , an important issue affecting our youth . The OC carried out a role play with the participants to describe the issue of teenage pregnancy and propose ways to deal with it. After the projection of a video entitled \"La participation, c'est quo i?\", Mr I Bawamia , Investigator at the OCO, helped the children understand that effective participation depends on two conditions . Firstly, respect for others is a sine qua non , keeping i n mind that everyone has a different opinion and that consideration should be given to others' views . Secondly, peace and dialogue are two crucial elements to create non -violent contexts that facilitate communication and active participation from children. Mr Bawamia also emphasised the need for children to be able to express their opinions freely , while respecting their parents' opinions too. Report on Activities 2019 -2020 | 259 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Promoting the rights to be heard and to participate Voices of children In this workshop, p articipants from the different institutions were randomly assigned to five workgroups representing a specific topic each, namely 1. Bullying ; 2. The Right to Education ; 3. Teenage Pregnancy ; 4. The Right to Play , Rest and Leisure; and 5. The Right to Health . Four key questions related to each theme were provided to the workgroups. The investigators from the OCO were allocated to each group to facilitate the brainstorming and discussions around these questions. They ensured that every child around the table had the opportunity to voice out their views and thoughts . At the end of this exercise, spokespersons from each work group were i nvited on stage to present and share summaries of their group's discussions. This activity highlighted the open -mindedness and abi lity of all the participants to reflect on these issues. Report on Activities 2019 -2020 | 260 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Promoting the rights to be heard and to participate Feedback of Workgroup 1: Bullying Question 1: What do you understand by the term 'bullying'? Children have defined the term 'bullying' as using physical force to cause harm on someone else to make them behave as per their wish. They also believe that the victims suffer in silence and that bullying does not stop until the victim voices out their suffering. A bullying situation usually involves the victim(s), the one(s) causing harm and the spectators. Bullying can also be described as a negative judgmental attitude against a child's soc ial class, race, religion and disability. Question 2: What are the types of bullying? According to the participants, some of the types of bullying include physical and psychological harassment, sexual abuse, cyber bullying, aggression, threats against others. Moreover, peer pressure is a form of bullying which may include forcing others to take illicit substances, consume alcohol or smoke. Emotional bullying can be in th e form of taunts against someone's clothing style, physical appearance, verbal abuse which display jealousy, racism and discrimination. Children believe that emotional bullying can cause more harm than physical bullying since words hurt more than actions. Question 3: What are the consequences of bullying? Bullying can cause a child to be physically wounded and may need medical assistance, which disrupts his life. It may lead to loss of appetite, change in attitude at school and at home, isolation, self - harm and an inability to concentrate in one's studies thus negatively impacting the school grades. Children also believe that bullying can completely change a child's c haracter and personality in a negative way. It can eventually cause stress, anxiety, depression which may even lead to suicide. Question 4: What do you think can be done to prevent bullying? As a child, what steps can you take individually? In order to prevent bullying, more sensitisation campaigns should be organised at schools and children should be encouraged to participate in recreational activities such as sports and games. This would help them to build self -confidence and develop team spirit. Children also proposed that an 'anti -bullying day' should be organised where artists can be invited to make posters about the effects of bullying. As an individual, children believe that they should communicate more, build good relatio nships with their friends, and also be a good person so that others can learn from their behaviour. Report on Activities 2019 -2020 | 261 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Promoting the rights to be heard and to participate Feedback of Workgroup 2: The Right to Education Question 1: What is meant by 'Education'? Children have defined the term 'education' as the key for success. It is the most important factor to get a good job, to promote a better future. They believe that education will help them to support their family financially. Education also en ables them to behave respectfully at home and in society. Moreover, education empowers them as individuals. Question 2: Is education only limited to academic learning? Education does not only happen at school, but begins at home. Learning does not only take place at school, but also on the playground, through activities and in society. Education is not limited to academic learning, but also involves acquiring good values, manners and good behaviour at home and in society. Children believe that educa tion from early childhood enables a child to have what it takes to become a successful adult. Question 3: What are the factors which prevent a child to get access to education? The main factor which the participants talked about is poverty. They expressed that poverty is the primary reason why a child does not attend school. They often lack basic school materials such as school uniforms, school bags, shoes and stationery. They find the price of the bus pass too high, and that it should rather be free for everybody since they don't have enough money to afford it. Teenage pregnancy is also a factor which prevents some children from studying at school. Moreover, some children have learning difficulties such as dyslexia and do not have access to appropriate learning centres which suit their needs. Question 4: What needs to be done for every child to get access to education, and what can you do as an individual? Children proposed that the government should offer free bus pass and should cancel the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) fees at school. The social security aid should also be increased since it is not enough. They also requested the Government to provide them with free lunch since some children do not have food at school. The partici pants also think that more teachers should be hired since some schools lack staff. Moreover, they expressed that they want a moral values class, where they can learn about the reality of life, and not just academic subjects. They think that they would bene fit greatly from this initiative. Finally, to encourage students to attend school, teachers should treat every student equally and with respect. Report on Activities 2019 -2020 | 262 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Promoting the rights to be heard and to participate Feedback of Workgroup 3: Teenage Pregnancy Question 1: What is meant by 'teenage pregnancy'? Children have defined the term 'teenage pregnancy' as indulging in sexual activities and getting pregnant before the age of 18. Question 2: Who is concerned with teenage pregnancy? The girl and the boy who indulge in sexual activity are both concerned parties. However, the participants believed that the girl is mostly concerned as she is the one who has to carry the baby for the ne xt nine months, as well as giving birth. Her body is directly affected by this change, which will also impact on her education. They also believe that society will be judgmental towards the girl and this will affect her psychologically. The boy is concerne d too when it comes to supporting the girl by providing the baby with all its basic necessities. Question 3: In case of teenage pregnancy, how is the baby and the mother affected? The mother's body and health will both be affected by the pregnancy as her body will go through major changes. She might be too young to accept this change and she might get health complications which is unsafe for her. The participants also believe that a teenage mother lacks the maturity and resources to take care of a baby. The latter too will not have a proper and healthy upbringing. Question 4: What can be done to prevent teenage pregnancy? Suggestions? Teenagers should abstain themselves from having sexual intercourse. In case they do engage in sexual activities, they should use protection. There should be more talks about sexual education at school. The participants believe that consent should be obtained from both parties before having sexual intercourse. Moreover, they believe that, if a teenage mother does give birth to her baby and is unable to take care of him, s he should put him up for adoption since there are many couples who are unable to conceive. Report on Activities 2019 -2020 | 263 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Promoting the rights to be heard and to participate Feedback of Workgroup 4: The Right to Play, Rest and Leisure Question 1: Why should a child rest, play, take part in leisure and artistic activities? Children believe that leisure is important for a good physical and mental health. It is also imp ortant to take rest to concentrate better at school. Social activities are important to make new friendships and create more social bonds. Activities also serve as a means to relax and avoid stress. Question 2: How many of you practice leisure activities? How many times per week? Most of the students reported that they practiced sports and artistic activities such as football, judo, swimming, kick - boxing, dancing and playing the guitar. They usually spent three days a week doing physical exercises. They mostly practiced their hobbies during the weekend. Question 3: Do you think that there are enough f acilities available to practice leisure activities? Children expressed that there are not enough facilities available to practice sports, for example, transport as some sports centres are far from their place of residence. They also talked about how musical classes are not easily accessible to them. They explained that sports equipment is expensive and wished that sponsors could provide them with the right equipment. They also talked about pollution and the lack of security in recreational places such as beaches, mountains and lakes, which prevent them from visiting those places. Question 4: What can be done to promote more leisure activities for children? What can you do on an individual level? The students said that more school trips could be organised such as during every term. More recreational activities should be organised by the Government such as fairs, fun activities in leisure parks and courses in sport centres. They believe that children should be motivated and encouraged to j oin sports clubs where coaches could be available to them. This would prevent them from getting involved in illegal activities such as taking drugs and consuming alcohol. Parents should restrict small children from spending too much time on mobile phones, computer games and the internet. They should encourage their children from a young age to practice sports and they should plan more family outings in nature. Report on Activities 2019 -2020 | 264 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Promoting the rights to be heard and to participate Feedback of Workgroup 5: The Right to Health Question 1: What do you understand by the term 'Right to Health'? Children answered that the definition of the term 'Right to Health' is that each and every child deserve to be in good health since their birth. Parents should make sure vaccinations are given to their babies. They described 'good health' as being both physical and mental health. They believe that every person should be provided with the proper health care; vaccinations, medicines, good sanitation at school and at hom e, clean food and infrastructure. Question 2: What are the health issues faced by youngsters? They described health issues as physical and mental health issues. Physical health issues include obesity, epilepsy, diabetes, injuries caused by bullying, sexually transmitted diseases, malnutrition, respiratory problems and health complications due to teenage pregnancy. Mental health issues include depression, stress, anxiety, social isolation which can lead to suicide, peer pressure , and engaging in substance abuse such as drugs, alcoh ol and cigarettes. Question 3: Which factors can cause health issues in young people? Students explained that the factors causing health issues in children are poor family structure ; lack of care from parents ; academic failure leading to depression ; bullying which affect emotional and physical health ; loss in self -esteem ; and peer pressure which can push youth into using drugs . They also believe that lack of leisure and activities can cause stress and obesity. Question 4: What can be done to protect the right to health and what can you do as an individual? They believe that the Government should build more recreational parks and provide more incentives and information to prote ct children's health. They also said that the use of pesticides on fruits and vegetables should be reduced since it causes many diseases. The Government could organise sensitisation campaigns to promote healthy lifestyle among children and educate them abo ut the harmful effects of drugs and issues relating to teenage pregnancy. As individuals, children should be motivated to practice physical activities such as dance and sports, and leisure activities such as music, art and drama. This could help them in de veloping their self -esteem and self - confidence and in discovering their hidden talents.

The following i s a summary of these points as presented by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF; n.d.)85: Education must be child -centred and empowering. This applies to the curriculum as well as the educational processes, the pedagogical methods and the environme nt where education takes place. Education must be provided in a way that respects the inherent dignity of the child and enables the child to express his or her views in accordance with article 12 (1) and to participate in school life. Education must respec t the strict limits on discipline reflected in article 28 and promote non -violence in school. Education must include not only literacy and numeracy but also life skills such as the ability to make well -balanced decisions; to resolve conflicts in a non violent manner; and to develop a healthy lifestyle, good social relationships and responsibility, critical thinking, creative talents, and other abilities which give children the tools needed to pursue their options in life. 84 Committee on the Rights of the Child (2001). General Comment No.1 (2001): Article 29(1) The aims of education. Geneva: United Nations. 85 United Nations Children's Fund (n.d.). The Right to an Education is one of the most important principles in becoming a Rights Respecting School. Retrieved on 27 July 2020 from www.unicef.org.uk/rights -respecting -schools/the -right -to-education/ During visits at the various pre -primary schools , the OC took note of the environmental features including facilities available at the schools that can h elp stimulate and develop the children's interest s, aptitudes and self-confidence.

Report on Activities 2019 -2020 | 309 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Promotion of Children's Right s in Rodrigues Observations and suggested areas of improvement for pre - primary schools (PPS) in Rodrigues Observations Suggested Areas of Improvement PEDAGOGICAL SKILLS: Teachers are motivated to impart the best education to children. Children are inculcated with discipline through singing and theatrical performance. A continuous professional development process could be introduced for teachers to upgrade their skills. A Resource Centre equipped with local pedagogical tools could be set up. Teachers of all pre -primary schools could be encouraged to write stories , which can be published and placed in the Resource Cent re for other schools to get access to and use in their teaching. INFRASTRUCTURE: Infrastructure in some PPS were in a dilapidated state. For instance, broken tiles were found in a classroom at a PPS. The m atter was reported in 2018. Window panes were broken at one of the PPSs. Repairs had not been carried out yet due to access diffic ulties to the building. The Officer -in-charge for both the PPS s informed that these repairs had been reported to the Association of Pre-Primary Schools, but no action ha d been initiated as of yet. Chairs for children were found to be too high and uncomf ortable in some PPSs. Infrastructure need s to be improved to provide a conducive and safe learning environment to children. An acceptable chair size must be provided to children to prevent physical health issues and hazards. Report on Activities 2019 -2020 | 310 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Promotion of Children's Rights in Rodrigues Observations Suggested Areas of Improvement SUPERVISION: There seemed to be insufficient supervision from officials of the Inspectorate Division. At 09 00 hours , a PPS was still closed and children were waiting outside the school 's premises. In one PPS, children were left unattended while teachers were having a meeting . A close r supervision by School Inspectors is needed to ensure that teachers are comply ing with their work -related rules and regulations and performing their duties well. Meetings with staff and parents need to be organi sed either before or after the classes. HELPER: It was reported in all PPSs that the services of a Helper were part -time (one hour in the morning and one hour in the afternoon), which was insufficient especially when the teachers were absent. The services of full-time H elpers must be hired to improve the environmental cleanline ss and teaching -learning efficiency in PPSs. EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS AND INDOOR AND OUTDOOR GAMES: A lack of educational materials and indoor and outdoor games were found in nearly all PPSs, and some outdoor games were out of order. More educational materials and indoor and outdoor games must be provided to children in their schools to enhance the ir pedagogical development . \"Classroom environment is one of the most important factors affecting student learning. Simply put, students learn better when they view the learning environment as positive and supportive .\" ~ Joan Young, Author of the book \"Encouragement in the Classroom\" Report on Activities 2019 -2020 | 311 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Promotion of Children's Rights in Rodrigues \"Children need models rather than critics.\" ~ Joseph Joubert Studies shows that creative play supports children and young people's holistic development .

Report on Activities 2019 -2020 | 322 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Overseas Mission About the Republic of Djibouti and the situation on children The Republic of Djibouti is located in the horn of Africa. It lies in North East Africa on the Gulf of Aden at the southern entrance to the Red Sea. It shares borders with Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia . Djibouti is a significant transit location for migrants including children crossing especially from Ethiopia, over to Yemen and ultimately to the Arab ian Peninsula. Some migrant children who do not leave the country end up living on the streets of Djibouti City, the capital. In 2018, the Government of Djibouti through the Ministry of Women and Family in collaboration with IOM launched a study on the situation of s treet children. The study was funded by the European Union . It was conducted by the 'Direction des Statistiques et des Etudes D\u00e9mographiques (DISED) ' who met a total of 1,137 children and carried out a survey on their living conditions in the streets of Dj ibouti. Among those surveyed, 633 children aged 0 to 9 years old, of which 30.8 per cent (i.e. 195) were girls. T he rest of the children were aged between 10 to 17 years old, with 12.7 per cent (i.e. 64) of them being girls. This qualitative study revealed that 84.8 per cent of children in street situation were from Ethiopia, 9.1 per cent from Djibouti and 5.5 per cent from Somalia. The children were found begging on the streets or offering their services such as washing cars or shining shoes. Thes e children were very exposed to risks, abuses and vulnerabilities .

The child's usual behaviours change drastically. There are visible traces of injury or torture on the child's body. How to protect children from violence? The OC reflected with the participants on strategies that could be implemented to protec t children from violence. The following two main methods were identified by the participants within the context of Djibouti: 1. Adoption of the right sensitisation strategy to: sensitise children on all forms of abuse using a systemic approach; and educate parents on the prohibition of the UNCRC on corporal punishment. 2. Use of animation techniques to educate people on the effects of violence on children, such as: role plays; drama; and story -telling. The OC also flagged that sensitisation should be consultative and evaluated. Data collection and evidence gathering is of utmost importance in order to advocate for change on a macro level. This can be achieved by hosting small consultative workshops, distribution of research questionnaires and having me etings with children to listen to what they have to say on matters that concern them.

Based on the Ombudsperson for Children Act (OCA) 2003, the overarching mandate of the OC relates to the following main areas: monitoring compliance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) among all relevant local stakeholders; promoting the rights of children in the Republic of Mauritius including their rights to health, education, leisure and freedom of expression among others, as well as their best interests; and collaborating with public bodies, private organisations, individuals and associations of individuals in the promotion and protection of child rights. In order to achieve its mandate, one of the core functions of the OCO is to carry out investigations on any alleged case of child rights violations , either on its own motion or driven by a complaint made by any party . This is clearly set out in sections 6 and 7 of the OCA 2003 (refer to Appendix A) . The OCO receives complaints on various types of cases, for instance, a child with disabilities being denied special facilities for the School Certificate examinations; a case of parental alienation whereby a mother is not able to spend time with her son after her divorce; children found with no fixed abode during the confinement period; or bullying of a 6 -year -old minor by her classmates. The present chapter gives information on the 8 principles that guide the actions of the OCO and an overview of its investigation procedures. A summary of the number and types of cases/complaints that were dealt with duri ng the period from 01 July 2019 to 31 August 2020 is then provided, followed by a selection of 2 6 anonymised cases to illustrate the investigation work of the OCO. Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 358 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 7.2 The 8 guiding principles of OCO's investigations The OCO gives high importance to good governance which is translated into eight guiding principles that underlie its actions with regards to promoting and protecting children's rights: 1) Jurisdiction The OC has a clear mandate through the Ombudsperson for Children Act 2003 which specifies her role, powers and functions. Her decisions and actions are formulated and executed within the parameters of the OCA 2003. 2) Independence As long as she is operating within the limits of the OCA 2003, the OC perf orms her functions independently and does not take directives from any public or private authority. 3) Impartiality and fairness The OC remains a neutral party during dispute resolution and does not take sides. At the OCO, each complaint is received an d reviewed in an objective and fair manner, free from bias. All parties are treated without favour or prejudice. The views of the child are also given due consideration based on his/her age and level of maturity. 4) Best interests of the child The OC has a mandate to protect the best interests of the child in all circumstances. Being the primary advocate of the principles and rights enshrined in the UNCRC, the OC's interventions are always motivated by the best interests of the child. 5) Confidentiality The OC has the privilege and discretion to keep confidential or release information related to a complaint or investigation as appropriate. The OC does not disclose information about individual cases or visits and cannot be compelled to te stify about concerns brought to her attention. Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 359 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Confidentiality is very important to build the credibility of the OCO mainly because people who complain to the OC and who respond to the OC's investigations may fear retaliation. Therefore, protecting the ide ntities of witnesses and safeguarding the information communicated to the OC enable her to effectively and efficiently advocate for the rights of children. 6) Transparency In line with the OCA 2003, proper referral, assessment, intervention and review mechanisms have been created at the OCO to deal with every single complaint. Transparency is considered fundamental to accountability. In this regard, the OC submits to the President of the Republic of Mauritius an annual report showcasing the activities c arried out by the OCO during the preceding year that is subsequently rendered public. 7) Responsiveness The OCO provides a free and responsive complaint procedure for anyone who requires it. There are several ways through which a complaint can be made by or on behalf of children as follows: coming in person or phoning the office to speak with an Investigator or the OC; downloading a complaint sheet from the OCO's website, filling it in and send it back to the OCO; writing a letter to the OC about the co mplaint; or sending an email about the complaint to the OC. 8) Public awareness In order to make the general public aware of her role and the functions of her office, as well as the rights and responsibilities of children as promoted by the UNCRC, the OC works in close collaboration with the media, and also regularly organises awareness campaigns throughout the Republic of Mauritius.

The main explanation for this decline is that less people registered complaints during the confinement period which lasted more than two months, that is, from 20 March 2020 to 30 May 2020. In fact, only 30 cases were recorded during that time. Nevertheless, the OCO remained available through the phone and emails during the lockdown. Several initiatives to protect the rights of children were carried out by the OCO as described in chapter 1 of the present report. Tables 1 -4 below provide an overview of the case statuses of complaints registered for the period July 2019 - August 2020; the different categories of comp laints received; the profile of complainants; and the gender distribution of complainants, respectively.

Fifty -four cases are still awaitin g reports from various stakeholders and the remaining 33 cases are in progress. The categories of complaints vary from basic school problems to complex societal issues including family conflicts, domestic violence, abuse, neglect and poverty, as showcase d in Table 2 below. The main category of complaint investigated during this reporting year was about child neglect, which included 58 cases. The next most frequent category was that related to family conflicts (i.e. 57 cases), which mainly arose due to non -respect of Court Orders on parental custody and visitation rights, Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 362 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children followed by the category of complaints regarding school problems (i.e. 56 cases). It must be noted that the category indicated as 'Others' in Table 2 represents those cases that involve co mpounding difficulties, in other words, cases constituting of two or more categories of complaints (e.g. family conflict, child behavioural problems and sexual abuse).

These enabled investigators to: interact with children in their residential care and/or educational setting; quickly obtain informat ion from children and relevant people; give advice, as necessary; and establish contact with headteachers, rectors, parents, carers and other professionals working with children and/or students, thereby improving their awareness of the role of the OCO. 7.5 Examples of cases over the reporting period 2019 -2020 Out of all the cases handled by the OCO over the reporting year 2019 -2020, the current section details 26 of them to provide an overview on the broad nature of complaints that are received at this Office and their related interventions. The names of complainants, children, schools and places have been replaced with arbitrary letters to prevent their identific ation. CASE 1: Advocating for a minor's rights to benefits payable by the Statutory Bodies Family Protection Fund Background Social security is a child right, as enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child (United Nations [UN], 1989)89. Yet, many children do not receive the essential cash transfers or pension benefits related to their nutrition, health, education and care that could make a real difference in realising their full potential. Having signed and ratified the UNCRC in 1990, the Repu blic of Mauritius has committed itself to putting children first on all its agendas, including the issue of social protection which encompasses social assistance and economic support and services to children. Nature of the complaint A mother reported at the OCO that she was cohabiting with a partner, Mr. Y. However, before the birth of their son, her partner passed away and she had to lodge a case before the Supreme Court to 89United Nations (1989). Convention on the Rights of the Child.

After 11 years, the boy, now a teenager was finally judicially acknowledged as being the biological child of Mr Y. The mother stated that, after the death of her partner, her son should have benefitted from a pension under the Statutory Bodies Family Protection Fund (SB FPF) Scheme, but this was not received because the boy's case of bearing his father's name was pending before Court at the time. The Manager of the SBFPF wrote to the mother saying that, in the event her application is favourably entertained by the Supreme Court, all the rights of her son would be preserved, and the pension benefits would be granted to him. When eventually the Court declared and decreed the minor as the natural son of late Mr. Y, the mother renewed her request to the SBFPF but received no r eply. The mother thereby made an official complaint to the Ombudsperson for Children's Office (OCO) in that regard. International frameworks relevant to the complaint UN Convention on the Rights of Child (refer to Appendix E) Article 8: Right to an identity Article 26: Right to social security International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Right s (UN, 1966)90 Article 9: Right to social security \"The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right of everyone to social security, including social insurance. \" Local framework relevant to the complaint The local body particularly relevant in the present case is the Statutory Bodies Family Protection Fund . The Fund has been set up since 1966 under the Statutory Bodies Family Protection Fund Act for the purpose of providing assistance mainly to families of deceased employees of Municipal/District Councils, Sugar Industry Labour Welfare Fund, Town and Country Planning Board, 90 United Nations (1966).

In the event of the death of an associate or contributor t o the SBFPF Scheme, his/her family will derive the following benefits, as applicable: A monthly pension is payable to a beneficiary on the death of an associate irrespective of whether the associate dies in service or after leaving the service. Following t he passing away of an associate, a pension is paid to his/her beneficiary (widow/widower/orphans). A female orphan is paid an orphan pension up to the age of 21. Once she gets married, the pension is discontinued. A male orphan is paid an orphan pension up to the age of 18 which may be extended up to the age of 21 provided written evidence is produced that he is receiving full -time education. The quantum of the monthly pension is determined based on the last salary of the associate, the length of contributo ry month(s) of service and the rate of pension to be used. Actions taken 1. Phone conversation with an Officer of the SBFPF : An Investigator of the OCO spoke to an officer of the SBFPF who stated that he would look into the matter. After a few weeks, the Investigator spoke to the same Officer to obtain a feedback and he confirmed that the necessary is being done for the minor to get his social aid. 2. Meeting with complainant: The investigator of the OCO met with the mother who stated that her son has be nefitted a partial amount of money from the SBFPF, but complained that the minor has not been allocated back payment of the pension benefits from the time he was born to date to which he is entitled to. 3. Letter sent to the SBFPF : The investigator of the OC O sent a letter to the Manager of the SBFPF advocating the right of the child to pension benefits from the Fund from the time he was born to date. 4. Follow -up phone conversation with an Officer of the Statutory Bodies Family Protection Fund : On the phone, a n Officer of the SBFPF stated that the matter would be taken up by the Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 367 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Committee of the Fund and it is very likely that the complainant would receive the full pension by the end of the month. Outcome The mother phoned the OCO and thanked the Office for its prompt intervention as her son ha d received full back payment of the pension benefits. She stated that she would use the pension benefits for the education of her son. Comment(s) Mauritius stands out amongst many African states in that it has a comprehensive social welfare system to which Mauritians have universal access. Nevertheless, the country should continue to build upon the development of social protection which would powerfully contribute to reducing poverty, exclusion and i nequality. After all, children's rights and welfare are the cornerstone of democracy. Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 368 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children CASE 2: Promoting the rights of a mother and her 8 children to adequate housing Background The right to adequate housing is of particular significance to children. Without a decent and secure housing, children are unlikely to realise their right to grow and develop in an atmosphere of moral and material security, free from abuse and neglect . As a welfare state, it is crucial for o ur country to tackle the underlying issues of inadequate housing in a proactive way. Nature of the complaint The Ombudsperson for Children opened an investigation regarding the case of Ms X, a mother of three children and a grandmother of five orphans. Her house was severely damaged by Cyclone Calvinia that struck Mauritius in 29 -30 December 2019, and she has since been living in a Community Centre with her dependents without basic necessities. International frameworks relevant to the complaint UN Convention on Rights of Child (refer to Appendix E) Article 27: Right to adequate standard of living Universal Declaration of Human Rights (United Nations, 1948)91 Article 25: Right to adequate standard of living and to social security (1) Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well - being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control. (2) Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance. All children, whether born in or out of wedlock, shall enjoy the same social protection. 91United Nations (1948).

She is totally dependent on her eldest daughter, who lives a kilometre from the Community Centre, for food and other essential provisions. However, the food is very often insufficient. She also stated that she cannot cater for milk for her grandchild of 2 years and the children eat mostly bread and butter. iv) The children are very depressed with their situation. They are deprived of living in hygienic conditions, proper balanced meals, sanitation facilities, access to basic health care services and security. v) Ms X depends on the social aids which the MSISSNS allocates to the children in order to buy food and clothing for them. vi) Ms X has formulated a requ est to the NHDC for a good housing and is aware that she has to submit further documents thereto. vii) Ms X is requesting the Ombudsperson for Children to take into consideration her grievances with respect to the rights of the children. 3.

Phone conversation with the Headmaster of a government school attended by most of the children : The Headmaster told the Investigator that there are many vulnerable children attending this school, including those living in dire housing conditions. He stated that the school daily provides to vulnerable students milk, cereal, bread and sausages/burger for breakfast, and bread and vegetables, a bottle of water, a small packet of biscuit and a fruit for lunch. He also added that the school personnel motivate the students by creating a good environment conducive to development at school. 5. Meeting with the Minister of Housing and L and Use Planning: The OC met with the said Minister regarding the case of Ms X and made an appeal to him to look into the matter with the NHDC so that Ms X and her children could benefit from a decent house with access to basic amenities like water and ele ctricity. 6. Phone conversation with Ms X: The Investigator of OCO phoned Ms X to obtain a feedback on her situation. She stated that she and her children are still living in the Community Centre and are hoping to have their own house soon. She stated that she is being helped by an NGO. She was fur ther advised to speak to an officer of the NHDC through the Community Welfare Officer to obtain an update on the development of her case. Outcome As at date, Ms X's case is still pending. The Investigator of the OCO is monitoring the case. Comment(s) When dealing with the social dimension of sustainable development, it is important that the relevant authorities prioritise this basic social right for all children - the right to adequate housing. A decent house can become the basis to further protecting children from exposure to different forms of harm and the long -term effects of poverty and disadvantage. Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 372 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children CASE 3: Bullying involving college students in a school bus Background A problem that is plaguing many schools is bullying. Bullying c an make the lives of children victims a misery. It undermines their confidence and self -esteem and destroys their sense of security. Bullying can occur anywhere, and it may become even more dangerous when the child is on a school bus as he/she cannot walk away from the situation. While in the school setting, the Headmaster/rector and educators have the responsibility of ensuring discipline, it is somehow assumed that the same responsibility would be expected from the conductors/driver to maintain order in the school bus. However, when students use the school bus for bullying activities, the task of the bus conductors or driver becomes a challenge while the plight of the child victim is appalling. Initiation of own -motion enquiry The Ombudsperson for Children opened an own -motion investigation pursuant to the circulation of a video clip posted online whereby a group of four college students were seen bullying a boy on the school bus of the company Z Co. Ltd. In the video clip, two boys were seen aggressing the victim , while two others were verbally abusing him and encouraging the bull ies. It appeared that the other people on the bus , including the one filming the incident, silently lent support to the bullying by failing to provide assi stance to the victim . International frameworks relevant to the case UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (refer to Appendix E) Article 19: Right to be protected from all forms of violence and abuse Ministerial Declaration entitled \"Implementing the internationally agreed goals and commitments in regard to education\" adopted by the UN Economic and Social Council (UN ECOSOC): Ministers and Heads of States participating at the high -level segment of the substantive session of 2011 of the Economic an d Social Council, held in Geneva from 4 to 8 July 2011, pledged that: Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 373 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children We stress the need to take measures to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence in any educational setting, including gender -based violence, bullying and cyber -bullying, and recognize the need for the development of a safe and supportive educational environment, counselling and complaint and reporting mechanisms to address those issues effectively. We recognize the need to protect children and young people from other risks they face in the educational environment and encourage the taking of effective measures in that regard. We also stress the importance of girls and boys getting to school safely. (ECOSOC, 2011, para.14)93. Local framework relevant to the case In 2015, the Ministry of Education and Human Resources, Tertiary Education and Scientific Research (MEHRTESR, 2015, pp.12 -13)94 elaborated a Student Behaviour Policy which clearly stated with regards to the issue of bullying that: Bullying should not be tolerated in any of its forms and should be considered as being a very serious offence to be dealt with accordingly and with all required severity. Preventive approaches should be adopted to make the school a bully free zone for all. Victims and other students should be encouraged to come forward and disclose any averred or suspected cases which should be addressed very cautiously to avoid repercussions from the bully. While support should be provided to the child victim as a first priority, the school should consider productive ways of working with bullies towards changing their aggressive attitudes as well as other constructive re sponses aiming at avoiding repetition. 93Economic and Social Council (2011).

Phone conversation with the Deputy Rector of the college : The Ombudsperson for Children (OC) spoke to the Deputy Rector of the college and was apprised that he had already initiated the following actions: (i) The concerned children, all 12 years old, of Grade 7 were referred to the Disciplinary Committee of the college. (ii) The service of the Brigade pour la Protection des Mineurs was sought in order to provide an early intervention assistance t o the concerned children. (iii) A meeting was scheduled with the parents of the children at the seat of the college. (iv) A letter has also been sent to the Bus Service of the Z Co. Ltd as, reportedly it was the bus conductor who was filming the incident and incited the other children to bully the boy. He allegedly failed to provide assistance to the child being bullied. While lauding the prompt measures taken by the Deputy Rector, the OC expressed her concern that bullying is a rampant issue and children need to be sensitised about it. The OC proposed to carry out a sensitisation session to Grade 7 students on a mutually agreed date with the Deputy Rector. 2. Field visit: The OC along with an Investigator carried out a field visit to the school and spoke to the Deputy Rector. The latter stated that the victim in the bus was actually a bully in class who constantly harasses his classmates, and that the children had decided to corner him in the bus and bully him as a revenge for his acts. He also stated that bullying is common among older students as well and that certain cases unfortunately go unreported. Additionally, the OC had the opportunity to speak with several educato rs who talked on the general atmosphere of the college, the challenges they face while teaching in class and how it is difficult to control children with challenging behaviours. 3. Sensitisation at school : On the scheduled date , the OC carried out a 30 -minu te intensive sensitisation session with 140 Grade 7 students in the library of the college on various topics Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 375 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children including the role of the OC, the different forms of violence such as bullying, the importance of discipline, and their rights and responsibilities . The sensitisation activity was followed by a question -and-answer session with the participants. The students asked many questions regarding the reporting mechanism on bullying. The OC stated that cases on bullying should be reported primarily to the scho ol management and added that the children can contact her office directly when they feel that their rights are being violated. Outcome An Investigator of the OCO called the Deputy Rector of the college. He stated that through the various interventions, the problem of bullying among the concerned children is under control and that the school bus conductor has been replaced by another one. Comment(s) Bullying cannot be overlooked given its far -reaching effects in terms of violations of children's rights. The OC believes that the issue of bullying can be effectively dealt with at interpersonal, family, school, community and State levels through multi -stakeholder collaboration. The empowerment of all stakeholders working with children is key to tackling the problem at its core. It is important to find lasting solutions to manage bullying in our educational and societal institutions. With regards to the present case, the OC recommended the following: 1. An action plan on how to discipline bullies needs to be established. 2. Anti-bullying rules need to be defined and enforced. 3. Students should be encouraged to act as whistle -blowers and report any witnessed or suspected cases of bullying to their Rectors/teachers. 4. Rectors and school staff should be empowered on how to combat bullying. They should also be able to identify and dutifully report any act of violence to the concerned authorities. 5. Values should be inculcated to students on promoting bullying -free and compassionate school environments through the adoption of codes of conduct and the integration of human values in the curriculum. Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 376 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 6. Mentorship/buddy schemes could be introduced in schools whereby students of higher grades could act as mentors for their juniors. The mentors would help their mentees not only in their academic studies but also in other day -to-day issues. This will be a pragmatic way to foster human values and train the students from early on to look out for each other. 7. The National Land Transport Authority should sensitise bus drivers and conductors on how to address violence in the bus with respect to teenagers and to report cases of violence to authorities. Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 377 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children CASE 4: Child abduction by a mother Background The Ombudsperson for Children receives many cases where after a divorce or separation one of the parents try to alienate the child from the other parent. The OC tries to resolve such problem through mediation in the best interests of the child, and if mediation fails, the parties will be requested to go to Court. There are also cases where one parent would take the child abroad, often with the consent of the other parent, and later would decide to settle in the other country, keeping the child with him/her. In certain instances, some parents are even deprived of all contact with their child. Nature of the complaint The complainant, Mr. B, married a foreigner lady, Ms. C and , from that marriage, Child D , who is currently 4 years old, was born. When the latter was three years old, the mother returned to her country and since then she has been living separately from Mr B. Six months later, Ms C returned to Mauritius and applied to the Court for the custody of the child . The Court granted custody to the father and the right of visit and lodging to the mother. At this point, Mr B. made a complaint to the OC that the Family Division of the Supreme Court did not take into account a report of the Child Development Unit (CD U), but based itself on other reports to grant the mother the right of visit of three hours twice a week. The matter was still in Court for further deliberations. The OC met the complainant and informed him that, as per section 7(4) of the Ombudsperson for Children Act (OCA) 2003, she cannot investigate any case which is pending before any Court. The complaint was set aside. The Court case evolved and the Judge also granted the right to the mother to take Child D to her country for six weeks as part of the \"droit d'h\u00e9bergement\" provided by the Code Civil Mauricien . At the time, the father had no objection. However, in November of the same year, Mr B filed an affidavit and moved that an Interim Order be issued to discharge the previous order. Subsequently, o ne week later, both parties reached an agreement in Court , and the father declared that he ha d no objection for the mother to take the child to her country to visit her parents. The mother had undertaken to return the child to Mauritius on 30 December of t he same year. It was also agreed that , while Child Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 378 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children D was abroad, the mother would arrange for the child to contact his father at least thrice a week through online means. One day , the father phoned the OC again to complain that the mother was allegedly abducting his son to her country under the pretence that she was taking him to visit his grandparents abroad. Their flight was leaving in the evening. Given that the mother's country of origin is not a signatory t o the Convention on the Civil Aspect of International Abduction (Hague Conference on Private International Law [HCCH], 1980)95, also known as the Hague Convention, he believed that the mother would keep the child with her forever. Thus, he would become a v ictim of parental alienation. He claimed that the right of the child to maintain contact with both parents would be violated. He requested the OC to intervene and to put an objection to departure to stop the mother and child from leaving the country.

Action(s) taken and their corresponding results Actions taken Corresponding result(s) 1. An Investigator spoke to the father to explain that there was no abduction as he agreed in Court to allow the child to travel. The child did not return to Mauritius. Mr B reported a case of child abduction to the police. Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 380 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children However, if, by the date set by the Court for the return of the child, the latter did not come back, he should report a case of child abduction to the police. 2. A letter was sent by the OCO to the Commissioner of Police to inquire about the status of the abduction case. The OC learnt that the Interpol informed the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family Welfare that no further action could be initiated at their level without an international warrant with Red Notice from the Supreme Court of Mauritius. The case of alleged abducting minor was sent for advice at the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) who recommended the police the following: \"Being given that [Ms. C's country] is not a party to the Hague Convention, no advice can be tendered at this stage. However, Ms C [is] to be arrested upon arrival in Mauritius.\" 3. Through the 'Association des Ombu dsmans et M\u00e9diateurs de la Francophonie' (AOMF), the OC obtained the contact details of the National Human Rights Council (NHRC) of [Ms. C's country]. The OCO sent a letter to the President of that institution requesting the latter's collaboration on this case and information on the living conditions of the Child D. The Officers of the NHRC visited Ms C and Child D. They reported that the child was living in good conditions and is even enrolled in a school near his place of residence. They further stated that the father has regular contact with the child online and that Ms C has no objection to the father visiting their child abroad. Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 381 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 4. The Ombudsperson for Children contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inquire on any support which could be provided to Mr B. The Ministry submitted a report to the OC stipulating the following: Ms. C's country is not signatory to the Hague Convention and a Court Order issued in Mauritius may not be enforceable there. Ms. C's country's Embassy was approached through another regional embassy for possible assistance. Advice was being sought from the Passport and Immigration Office, Commissioner of Police and Ministry of Gender Equality and Family Welfare. A Red Notice Control has been issued against Ms C. The best ways forward in the case were: to seek conjugal reconciliation and agreement on shared custody of the child; to enlist the support of Ms. C's country's authorities without which all actions there may be considered as an offence; and to send a copy of the Red Notice to the foreign authorities. Outcome The fact that Ms. C's country is not a signatory of the Hague Convention makes it difficult for Mauritian authorities to intervene. Hence, it is important to enlist the support of the foreign country's authorities without which all action s could be considered as unlawful. This was why, at this level, diplomacy seemed to be the best option to solve such a problem . The OCO's enquiry revealed that there is a case lodged before the foreign country's Court by Ms C. Given that the OC is bound by the Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 382 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children OCA 2003 that clearly stipulates in its section 7(4) that the OC cannot \"investigate in any case which is pending before any Court\" , the case was eventually closed at the level of the OCO. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Regional Integration and International Trade is dealing with the case. The complainant has been apprised of same. Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 383 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children CASE 5: Child suffering from severe visu al impairment denied special facilities for the School Certificate examinations Background Children with disabilities have to overcome many hurdles in their quest to enjoy their right to education fully. They are disadvantaged right from pre -primary leve l as many schools are not fit to accommodate them adequately. The large majority of them are admitted in specialised schools which are run by NGOs. These schools usually do not have sufficient funding and they cater for different levels of disabilities. In clusive education still not being a reality in our schools, only a handful of children with disabilities do make it to Grade 11 or above. Even though these children are given special facilities for the 'O' and 'A' levels examinations, more often than not, these are insufficient. Nature of the complaint The mother of a visually impaired child complained to the Ombudsperson for Children that the Mauritius Examinations Syndicate (MES) has informed her that her child (Child Z) will not benefit from all the extra facilities requested to be able to take part in the Cambridge 'O' level examinations. Only a few weeks were left before the examinations begin. The mother explained that without the requested facilities, Child Z was bound to fail. In terms of Ch ild Z's history, he was declared legally blind after having been examined by medical professionals since a very young age. At the age of 5 years, he joined a school for the blind. There were few pupils in the class. The teacher would read all materials and the child would dictate him the answers and he would write these for the child. For the Certificate for Primary Education (CPE) examinations, the MES provides a reader/writer ascribed for all papers, enlarged text and extra time of 20 mins per hour. C hild Z passed his CPE examinations and got admission in a State Secondary School. A few days after his admission in Grade 7, a case conference with all stakeholders was held and it was decided Child Z needs a permanent assistant who will read the texts a nd write down the answers he would dictate. A permanent assistant was assigned as reader and writer to the child. Therefore, Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 384 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children for all his tests and examinations he was provided with a human reader or writer, enlarged text, use of magnifier and overhead lig ht. When the child reached Grade 11, the mother wrote to the MES through the Rector of the school to inform that the child will not be sitting for two papers namely Mathematics and Principles of Accounts due to his blindness. She also requested exemption for the English Oral Paper. Other facilities were requested as well such as a reader and writer for all papers, enlarged A3 questionnaires, extra time and use of a magnifier. A few weeks before the start of the examinations, the MES informed the mother tha t the requests were being acceded to except for the provision of a reader/writer for some papers - English Language, Literature in English and French. This implied that the child would not be able to take these three papers according to his usual way of wo rking. The mother was worried that this would greatly impede the performance of Child Z at these examinations, which was the basis of the complaint she made to the OCO.

An Investigator of the OCO contacted the Rector of the school to inquire about the situation. The Rector informed the Investigator that he did not receive anything in writing. He was informed verbally by the parents that, for 3 sub jects, the child will not benefit from the services of a reader/writer. He said he would enquire on the matter from the MES. 2. A letter was sent to the Special Educational Needs Authority. The Officer -in-charge of the Special Education Needs Unit of the Mi nistry of Education informed the OCO that they would verify the issue with the MES. However, the final decision would rest with the latter who are the representative of the Cambridge Examinations Syndicate in Mauritius. 3. A letter was sent to the Director of the MES. The OC advocated for the respect of the right of the child to education on an equal basis with others. She emphasised that access to education enables children with disabilities to fully exercise all their other human rights. An Offic er of the MES spoke with the OC. She stated that the facilities provided are according to Cambridge Examinations Syndicate regulations. The OC requested the use of a humanitarian approach to finding a solution in the best interests of Child Z. The Officer stated that she will take the matter with her Director. Later, the OC was informed that the child would be provided with a computerised reader and the support of a technician. Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 386 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 4. The parents were informed that the MES would provide a computerised reader an d the support of a technician. Both the parents of Child Z are professionals in the IT Sector and called at the OCO to report that the software provided by the MES requires the user to have specific training to be familiar with its operation. They already sent a letter to the MES in this regard. Overall outcome The parents applied to the Judge sitting in Chambers at the Supreme Court to give a ruling in this case. The Ombudsperson for Children was summoned by the Court as the parents applied for the case to be heard in the presence of the OC. An Investigator was designated to represent the OC. At the very beginning of the hearing, the Officer of the MES informed the Honourable Judge that the Cambridge Examinations Syndicate agreed to provide a human r eader/writer to the child for all papers under certain conditions which must be agreeable to both the parents and the MES. Both parties gave their approval. Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 387 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children CASE 6: Parental alienation - mother wants to spend time with her son who lives abroad with his father Background The disagreements and conflicts that arise during parental separation and divorce undoubtedly affect children even more so when one parent lives abroad. The best interests of the child should be paramount when taking child custody decisions. Having a loving relationship with both parents is key to a child's well -being, but arranging such relationships in the context of parental separation can be one of the main challenges in resolving a child custody dispute . There are prima ry considerations when determining what is in the best interests of the child. The first is the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both parents. The second is the need to protect the child from psychological or physical harm by p reventing exposure or subjection to abuse, neglect or family violence. Nature of the complaint A mother, Ms. P, requested the intervention of the Ombudsperson of Children (OC) to establish a visitation agreement between herself and her ex -husband regard ing their son . The complainant and her husband married and lived abroad before they separated. They have a 10 -year -old son living with his father in the latter's country of origin. Ms. P said that she was a victim of domestic violence and consequently left the conjugal roof. She is now residing at her mother's house in Mauritius. Ms. P alleged that she had very limited contact with her son. She claimed that her husband constantly abused and harassed her through text messages, and blackmailed her into sendin g money failing which all contact with her son would cease. The complainant would like to spend quality time with her son be it in Mauritius or in the father's country. Ms. P stated that communication is very difficult with the father and that she feels al ienated from her son. She also knew that the child suffered from her absence. The complainant was planning to file for divorce proceedings, but she could not afford to lodge a case before the Court at the moment.

Liaison with child's school: An Investigator of the OCO promptly contacted the Rector of the college and apprised him of the problem. The particulars of the child and his family background were then recorded. The child is an orphan. His mother passed away when he was still very young and he did not know his father. He has an elder sister who will soon attain majority. The child presently lives with his maternal aunt who has 4 children of her own. Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 391 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 2. Phone conversation with maternal aunt: The Investigator spoke to the child's aunt. She stated that she works hard to care for her children and nephews. Her children are taken care of financially by their father. She said that the child receives a social allowance for being an orphan. The aunt stated that the boy could be difficult to handle at times. A Psychologist of the CDU who works with this child had told her that the latter displays such behaviour to cope with his anxiety and is in need of attention. 3. Meeting at the school: An investigator of the OCO requested a meeting with the child and specific personnel of the school. Another Investigator chaired a meeting with an educator and the section leader. They were apprised of the child's circumstances. They understood that his family situation is quite difficult. According to the scho ol, the child is quiet, well -behaved and participates in class. He makes reasonable effort in his studies. 4. Individual interview with child: An Investigator interviewed the child separately. He spoke clearly and openly to the Investigator. He stated that h e begs because he does not receive any pocket money and therefore cannot buy any sweet or snack. His cousins and sister do not receive pocket money either. The child appears to be well cared for. He brings his own lunch every day. 5. Home visit: Two investi gators carried out a home visit to meet with the child's maternal aunt. The latter could not call at the OCO because of her work schedule and she has a young child under her care. It was assessed that the boy lives in a safe and caring environment. The mat ernal aunt has two jobs and caters for her children's as well as her nephew's needs equally. The Investigators appealed to the aunt to remain supportive, given the child's difficult family history. Outcome Following the Investigators' meeting at the boy 's school, the educators apprised the rector of the matter. The school positively and promptly responded to the needs of the child and the personnel started to provide food and snacks on a daily basis to the boy. Through the Parent Teacher Association's fu nds, this practice was extended to other needy students. Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 392 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Comment(s) An isolated case of a child begging on the streets may seem trivial to some people, but this is an important social matter that has to be tackled at its roots. In the current case, the child had very difficult beginnings with his mother's early death and an unknown father. He was dependent on his next of kin (i.e. his maternal aunt) who already had many children and who could only afford him his basic needs. He was attempting to fulfil h is wants for sweets and cakes through begging. As it turned out for this case, this child necessitated strong family -community mobilisation including the school and relevant authorities to support his needs and age -appropriate wants. Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 393 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children CASE 8: A child having mental health crisis at school Background Children with behavioural, emotional and social difficulties are a vulnerable group in school communities as they can be subject to exclusion or discrimination relative to other students due to the c hallenges to the school in managing them. Early childhood traumas can also further aggravate their behaviours and lead to significant mental health issues in these children. At the Ombudsperson for Children's Office (OCO), there has been a growing number o f complainants regarding instances where their children are being abstained from being at school due to unmet mental health needs. Research studies have shown that mental health disorders can impact on a child's cognitive and social development. Providing adequate support services to these children in a timely manner is primordial, but finalising such arrangements among the relevant parties can become a long and bureaucratic process. To enable these children to fulfil their right to education, all relevant stakeholders must collaborate closely to devise the necessary solutions in the best interests of the children. Nature of the complaint An aggrieved grandmother wrote to the Ombudsperson for Children's Office (OCO) regarding the difficulties and discrimi nation that her three grandchildren, minors J, K and L, aged 11, 7 and 6 years respectively, were allegedly facing at the ABC Government School because of their ethnicity. According to the complainant, due to a mental health problem, minor J who was in Grade 6, was transferred from the ABC Government School to MN Government (SEN Integrated Unit) School. However, she knew another child with mental health issues, who was in Grade 6 in ABC Government School and who did not undergo a transfer, but was provid ed with an individual teacher. The grandmother also stated that she does not know how to read and write and that the Headmaster of ABC Government School had made her sign papers. She also said that the school wanted to transfer her 2 other grandchildren, m inors K and L, and stated that the latter were being discriminated because of their ethnic identity. Ms. G, SEN Educator at MN Government School addressed a complaint regarding minor J to the Ministry of Education, Tertiary Education, Science and Technolo gy (ME TEST ) and copied same to the OCO. According to Ms. G, minor J was behaving aggressively and even attempted to harm himself. It Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 394 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children was also flagged that minor J had regular violent outbursts and even attempted suicide by trying to strangle himself with h is handkerchief and shoelaces. Moreover, the Acting Headmaster of the MN Government School, Mr. H, addressed a complaint regarding minor J to the METEST , copied to the OCO. He stipulated that the child suffered from Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder ( ADHD). He also described an incident which occurred at the school, whereby minor J became violent and unmanageable, and he got minor injuries by smashing a windowpane in a fit of anger. Mr. H stated that the Child Development Unit (CDU) of that region was unreachable when contacted, hence assistance was sought from the 113 hotline. He was advised by the CDU Officer to treat it as a case of child injured at school and to take him to the regional hospital, from where, assistance can be provided to take him t o the mental health care centre where minor J is an outpatient. However, due to a lack of appropriate means of transport and the personnel being unwilling to accompany the child in the absence of the grandmother who was not reachable, the child was not tra nsported to the hospital. They then had recourse to the police station of the locality who agreed to take minor J to the hospital with a responsible party. The grandfather of minor J was called to the school, but, on arrival, he refused to take the child t o the hospital. Minor J and his grandfather were eventually taken to the police station for a written statement. For information, minors J, K and L had been living with their grandmother following an incident where minor J was sodomised by an acquaintance . The minors' parents had drug problems and their father had been incarcerated several times. According to the psychologist of the CDU, minor J also had been physically abused by his stepmother who is also a drug addict. International frameworks relevant to the complaint UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (refer to Appendix E): Article 2: Right to non -discrimination Article 3: Best interests of the child Article 6: Right to survival and development Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 395 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Local framework relevant to the complaint Ombudsperson for Children Act (OCA) 2003 (refer to Appendix A) Section 5(a): T he OC \"shall ensure that the rights, needs and interest of children are given full consideration by public bodies, private authorities, individuals and association of individuals\" . In this particular case, the OC initiated an investigation as it was believed that the best interests of the children were not being catered for. Actions taken 1. Convocation: The Headmaster of the ABC Government School was convened at the OCO. However, it was the Acting Headmaster who attended the meeting as his predecessor had been promoted to the role of Inspector. The Ag. Headmaster stated that he was aware of the difficulti es faced by the minors and that arrangement had been made for the minors to be seen by a School Psychologist. When further enquired, he pointed out that, even though minor J was violent and aggressive at times, he was still manageable and fared well at sch ool. He pointed out that no discrimination was done against the minors, and that all children are treated equally irrespective of their ethnic identities. The Ag. Headmaster also pointed out that he cannot answer for his predecessor. 2. Feedback to the complainant: The grandmother was updated of the Acting Headmaster's convocation and she was informed of the change in Headmaster at ABC Government School. The grandmother remembered that minor J had behavioural problems and used to eat chalks in that schoo l. 3. Follow -up phone call to ABC Government School: A follow -up call regarding the progress of minors K and L in ABC Government School was carried out. The Ag. Headmaster stated that the minors were faring well at school. The grandmother was informed of sam e. 4. Letter addressed to the METEST : Following the complaint receiv ed from the SEN Educator, the OCO sent a letter to the Senior Chief Executive of the METEST to be apprised of the development of the case at their level. Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 396 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 5. Phone update to Mr. H, the Acting H eadmaster of MN Government School : An Investigator spoke with Mr. H and advised him to send an official letter to the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family Welfare (MGEFW) regarding Minor J. The Investigator reassured him that the OCO would do the needful follow -up to ensure that the concerned authorities were handling this matter diligently. 6. Letter addressed to the MGEFW: Following the complaint received, the OCO sent a letter to the Permanent Secretary of the MGEFW to request for a report on minor J's case. 7. Case conference : A case conference on minor J was held in the Conference Room of the MGEFW, which was chaired by the Head of the CDU. The OCO was also convened to this meeting as an observer. It is significant to note that the OCA 2003 provides that the OC collaborates with public bodies, private authorities, individuals and associations of individuals in the promotion and protection of child rights. Outcome The case conference resulted into possible courses of action with regards to minor J. According to Dr. WS, Consultant Psychologist at the national mental health care centre, minor J is an outpatient since 2014 under treatment for ADHD. He also added that taking medication can help to control the challenging behaviours of the minor. It was c onfirmed that, minor J's behaviours were better and calmer at home when he is administered his medication, and he became aggressive at school because he was not taking his medication there. The following points were advanced at the conference: The continu um of care should prevail at school and Medical Social Workers could sensitise teaching and non -teaching staff, including the canteen seller, regarding pupils with special educational needs. The ME TEST could establish whether a teacher could give the child his prescribed medication with the informed and signed consent of the grandmother. Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 397 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Since minor J could be a threat to others and to himself, it was decided that it is best that he is placed in a separ ate class alone with a teacher for a while. An individualised educational care plan must be established for him. In situations when a child is hurt at school and the parents/legal guardians are unavailable or unreachable at that particular time, it was pro posed that the Headmaster could work out a care plan and write to the ME TEST for appropriate interventions. It is proposed that the minor J is followed by his treating doctor at the regional hospital instead of the national mental health care centre to av oid any social stigma and to shorten the travelling distance for the child. Additionally, an Investigator spoke with Mr. H, Ag. Headmaster of MN Government School regarding updates on minor J. Mr. H stated that the minor takes his medicine at school as pe r the doctor's prescription and is being followed by a psychologist. The HM also reported that, having been separated from the larger classroom to a smaller one has helped in decreasing the minor's aggressivity and his behaviours are improving through resp onsibility -taking activities. Comment(s) School environments have to become better equipped and sensitive at dealing with children with mental health problems and at promoting their right to education and proper development. It has been observed that of ten staff is not sufficiently trained and hence lack the skills on how to handle such students. In certain instances, educators do not have sufficient knowledge on how to identify students who are at risk. Therefore, when a child suddenly manifests a menta l health crisis at school, this creates a lot of anxiety and stress among the personnel who do not necessarily know how to de - escalate the child's behaviours and respond in a compassionate manner. Therefore, there is an important need to empower school sta ff on strategies they could use to deal with vulnerable children as they are directly involved on a daily basis with them. Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 398 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children CASE 9: Child's examination dates coinciding with her participation in an international competition Background The education of students can take several forms and academic learning is only one aspect. Nowadays, schools encourage more and more of their students to participate in extra -curricular activities. These activities allow children and young people to learn new skills such as leadership and public speaking, and present their creations, talents and inventions to different audiences, through innovative local and international platforms or competitions hosted by public, private or civil society sectors. They can als o inspire students towards specific hobbies and career choices. Nature of the complaint In September 2019, a parent wrote to our office regarding her 16 -year -old daughter, minor S, who is a Grade 12 student at TR State College. According to the complainant, minor S performs well academically and is a prefect at the school. Minor S was selecte d by a local non -governmental organisation (NGO) to participate in a two -day competition hosted by an international NGO in October 2019. The cost of participation was being borne by the local NGO. In August 2019, the Ministry of Education, Human Resources, Tertiary Education and Scientific Research (MEHRTESR) sent a letter to colleges of students selected on this international competition that they were not allowed to participate as the competition had not been approved by the MEHRTESR given that it was coinciding with the end of year examinations. In September 2019, a draft timetable was circulated by the TR State College and the first day of the competition was coinciding with the minor S's examinations. The parents of minor S made a request to the Recto r to consider either rescheduling the examination papers or promoting the child to Grade 13, even if she did not sit for the papers set on these two days. However, the Rector was not agreeable to any compromise and informed the parents that they had to mak e a choice between the competition and the examinations. Given that the child invested lot of time and resources in the preparation of that competition and is equally dedicated to her studies, the parents were concerned that the child might suffer Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 399 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children psychol ogically if she did not succeed in her goals. The Rector in turn asked the parents to get a clearance from the MEHRTESR for her participation in the competition after which he would consider making any concession. The complainant requested the Ombudsperson for Children (OC) to intervene in this matter. International frameworks relevant to the complaint UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (refer to Appendix E): Article 29 (the right to education): The education of a child should be directed to \" the development of their personality, talents and mental and physical abilities to their fullest potential.\" Local framework relevant to the complaint Ombudsperson for Children Act (OCA) 2003 (see Appendix A for more information): Section 5(a): T he OC \"shall ensure that the rights, needs and interest of children are given full consideration by public bodies, private authorities, individuals and association of individuals\" . Actions taken In this case, it appeared that the Rector was not sufficiently considering how the child would be adversely affected if she had to choose between taking part in the competition and sitting for her examinations, given that she had invested equally in both e ndeavours. In order to ensure that her right under article 29 of the UNCRC was respected, the OC wrote to the Rector to request him to review his stand on the matter and consider making adjustments so that minor S was not penalised. Outcome The Rector of the school rescheduled the examination papers that were previously set on the competition dates. Subsequently, the MEHRTESR wrote to the OCO to confirm that this rescheduling of the papers had been approved following the correspondence from the R ector of the college. As a result, minor S was able to participate in her international competition as well as sit for her examination papers. Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 400 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children CASE 10: A child who suffers from bronchial asthma not allocated a school near his place of residence Backgro und In all countries, asthma is a chronic condition commonly suffered by some children. Learning to live with this illness can be very challenging for these children and their families. The school life of these children can also be affected by unexpected respiratory difficulties during classes or sudden hospitalisations due to asthma attacks. They can feel quite different from their classmates and experience potential exclusion within the school environment. It is important that parents, schools and the re levant authorities are responsive to these children's needs and ensure that the necessary adjustments are made to minimise disruptions to the fulfilment of their right to education. Nature of the complaint In December 2019, the OCO received a complaint from a mother whose child, minor U, had just received his Primary School Achievement Certificate (PSAC) results and had been allocated a school far from his home of residence. Minor U would have to take two buses every day to go to and return from school. The mother also explained that his son suffers from bronchial asthma and cannot travel long distances. She advanced that it would be better for minor U to go to a school nearer to her house . Her place of work is also near her house and she could be readily available if minor U experience d any health issue during school hours. For instance, she related that, when her son was in primary school, he suffered from an asthma attack and had an inhaler overdose. Owing to her workplace's proximity with the minor's school, she was able to quickly fetch him and take him to the emergency services. The mother had already applied for school transfer at the level of the Ministry of Education, Tertiary Education, Science and Technology (METEST). However, she ha d not received any reply yet. International frameworks relevant to the complaint UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (refer to Appendix E): Article 3: Best interests of the child Article 28: the right to education Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 401 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Actions taken A letter was sent to the METEST by the OCO regarding this complaint. The OCO requested the Ministry to duly consider the minor's health issues and reallocation to a school nearer to his residence in his best interests. Outcome Two weeks following this letter, the ME TEST replied to the OCO stating that minor U had been allocated a school near to his home and an admission letter had already been issued to the parent. The OCO contacted the complainant for a follow -up. She stated that she was not satisfied with the new school and she would make alternative arrangements for her son to go to a nearby private school. Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 402 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children CASE 11: A child with challenging behaviours Background The present case is an example of a child with challenging behaviours within a school setting . There is a growing need for school staff to be sensitised and trained on how to respond to the complex needs of these children in a non -judgmental and compassionate manner. Multi -disciplinary collaboration in such cases is key in generating personalised and appropriate solutions. Nature of the complaint In July 2019, the Ombudsperson for Children's Office (OCO) received a letter from the Headmaster of a primary school who requested the Ombudsperson for Children (OC) to carry out a case conference regarding minor V, a Grade 3 student with behavioural problems. The letter also described the behaviours of minor V at school and it seemed that the child had difficulties to follow instructions and rules set in the class; sought attention by m aking loud noises and disrupted the class; annoyed his classmates by damaging their belongings; said that he likes to harm himself; had a provocative behaviour towards others; used to pinch himself or knock his head against the wall; and used his shoe lace s/jacket sleeve to attempt to strangle himself. The Headmaster explained that minor V had been referred to the Ministry of Education and Human Resources, Tertiary Education and Scientific Research (MEHRTESR). Minor V was allocated to an Educational Psycho logist who assessed him as having repressed anger and showing signs of inattentiveness, hyperactivity, behaviour problems and academic underachievement. The child's behaviours were showing no improvement at school. Subsequently, the Educational Psychologis t further referred the case to a Psychiatrist/Clinical Psychologist of the Ministry of Health and Quality of Life. It seemed that the parents were reluctant to take minor V to see a Psychiatrist/Clinical Psychologist. The Headmaster requested the OC to org anise a case conference so that all the relevant stakeholders could come together in order to properly cater for the welfare of minor V. Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 403 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children International framework relevant to the complaint UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (more details in Appendix E): Article 2 (Non -discrimination) Article 3 (Best interests of the child) Article 28 (Right to education) Article 29 (Goals of holistic education) Local framework relevant to the complaint Ombudsperson for Children Act (OCA) 2003 (refer to Appendix A) : Section 6(f): The OC shall \"initiate an investigation whenever the Ombudsperson for Children considers that there is, has been or is likely to be a violation of the rights of a child\". Section 6(g): The OC shall \"investigate cases relating to the situation of children in the family, in schools and in all other institutions, including private or public bodies\". Actions taken As mandated by the OCA 2003, the OC accepted the request for conducting a case conference because she considered that the implementation of the rights of minor V and other children affected by minor V's behaviours at school had to be assessed. The OC contacted the Headmaster to get a better understanding of the current situation with minor V at school. The case conference was ch aired by the OC and consisted of an Investigator from the OCO, the Headmaster, the Deputy Headmaster, the School Inspector, the Educational Psychologist of the MEHRTESR, a represe ntative of the school administration, minor V's Educator, the Holistic Educator and the Oriental Language Educator. The following points were highlighted: The challenging behaviours of minor V seemed to have worsened when his brother changed school. Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 404 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Minor V remained a risk to himself. He has been observed to hit himself and accusing other children to have harmed him. He even tried to choke himself by tying a plastic bag around his head. Minor V's Educator stated that she tried different strategies. She mad e him sit next to a student who works well but, after some time, minor V started to hide under the table. The Educator finally made him sit next to her and she felt that his behaviours had improved. Minor V had interest in sports, but, due to his limited a ttention span, he would get distracted and start hitting or throwing rocks at other students. The school convened his parents several times, but they said that minor V did not act this way at home. The Educational Psychologist was of the view that minor V was suffering from a psychiatric problem and that he would benefit from a psychiatric assessment. Outcome After the case conference, the Headmaster contacted minor V's father and urged him to take his child to a Psychiatrist. The father adhered to the Headmaster's instruction. During a follow -up call, an Investigator of the OCO was informed by the Headmaster t hat minor V is being regularly followed by a Psychiatrist and there was a marked improvement in the minor's behaviours. Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 405 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children CASE 12: A 6 -year old child's case of school absenteeism and the lack of psychological support Background School refusal is a significant emotional difficulty which can be a source of high levels of distress among the children affected and their parents. There can be several reasons why a child may refuse to go to school such as anxiety being in large groups, difficulties with ma king friends , issues with separating from parents, or bullying , among others. School refusal may manifest through a variety of behaviours such as temper tantrums, running away from school, physical complaints (e.g. stomach aches, muscle pains, etc.), distu rbed sleep, frequent needs to call in parents at school and regular trips to the hospital with no apparent medical cause, among others. This mental health problem among children can have both short - and long -term adverse consequences on their social and emotional development and requires prompt attention from parents, school staff and other relevant professionals. Nature of the complaint The parents of minor W, a 6-year -old child , complained to the OC that their daughter was refusing to attend school sin ce the past two weeks and was currently staying at home. They stated that, on the third day of the school term, they noticed a change in their daughter's behaviour. Minor W kept repeating that she was being hit by her teacher at school and that she would n ot be attending school anymore from now on. The parents also reported that the child was waking up at around 3 -4 a.m. and suffered from panic attacks. On one occasion, their daughter also complained about severe stomach ache such that she had to be rushed to hospital during the night. However, after examination, doctors did not find anything wrong with her health. Minor W was also seen by a Psychologist at the hospital. The latter recommended that the child be followed by an Educational Psychologist due to her severe anxiety. On the day of the complaint, minor W, who had accompanied her parents, reported to the OC that her teacher hit her with a ruler when she did not know answers to questions during lessons. She added that the teacher did not try to help her but instead made her sit at the back of the classroom Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 406 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children alone while telling her to return to her desk only when she would stop crying. The OC noted that the minor displayed a lot of stress and was clingy to her parents. The minor's father informed the O C that he wanted to have his child transferred to another school and would be going to the Zone Directorate to register his request. He added that, though he had given consent for his daughter to be followed by an Educational Psychologist, nothing material ised concretely yet. He was really worried about his child's situation and about the negative impact of his daughter's absence on her studies. With respect to the minor's right s to education, good health and well-being, the OC opened an investigation. International framework relevant to the complaint UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (more details in Appendix E) Article 2 : Non -discrimination Article 3 : Best interests of the child Article 19 : Child's protection against any form of abuse Article 2 8: Child's right to education Actions taken 1. The minor's mother informed the OCO that officials from the Zone Directorate requested her to fill out a transfer form and that they would do the necessary based on availability of a seat in another school. 2. The minor's father reported that his child was transferred to another school which is nearer to his place of residence. However, the minor was still refusing to attend school. The OC advised the father to make a request for the child to be followed by a School Psychologist at her new school and to ask for the assistance of the school's Headmaster concerning this issue. The OC asked the father to contact the OCO if no solutions were provided at the school level. She informed the father that she would also talk with the Headmaster concerning this situation. Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 407 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 3. The OC contacted minor W's new Headmaster to discuss her difficulties and requeste d him to help with the reintegration of the child at the school. 4. The OC also recommended the Headmaster to consider the child's best interests and requested that the minor W be offered psychological assistance at the earlies t with the consent of the pare nts. 5. The OC briefed the minor's parents about the actions taken at her end and requested them to keep her Office informed on any further development in their case. Outcome The actions taken proved to be effective. Through the request made by the OC, t he Headmaster assured that all necessary actions were taken for the well -being of minor W. The minor's father was contacted for a follow -up and he informed the OC that his daughter was currently attending her new school and was faring very well. Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 408 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children CASE 13: Lack of water causing unhygienic conditions for children at a pre -primary school Background Every child has the right to be provided with a safe and hygienic environment as this is essential to their physical and psychological health and well-being. This is applicable to all environments where children may find themselves such as home, school, playground and other community facilities. At school, it is primordial that the school management maintain a good standard of cleanliness in classro oms, sanitary facilities and the school yard , while ensuring the availability of all basic facilities such as water supply and electricity. Nature of the complaint The mother of a 3 -year -old boy complained to the OCO about the lack of hygiene existing i n her son's pre-primary school due to an inadequate supply of water since the start of the academic year. The complainant informed the OC that the school cleaner usually carries water to clean the toilet facilities. However, the cleaner had not been able t o attend work as she was unwell over a period of time. As a result, the toilets remained unclean with a constantly pungent smell, and this was causing major inconvenience to the students, especially those in the pre -primary section. The mother added that, due to the lack of water at school to wash their hands, the students are unable to normally carry out their daily routine. She also told the OC about the fact that parents were being asked to provide bottles of water to their children in order to wash the ir hands. The complainant stated that the situation had been going on for 5 months and she was greatly concerned about the students' health and well -being. She requested for appropriate measures to be taken as soon as possible. The OC opened an investigati on with respect to children's right to basic needs and good hygiene at this pre -primary school.

The OC contacted the Deputy Headmaster of the school to discuss about the situation. The latter stated that this was indeed a major issue in the pre -primary section. The OC expressed her concern regarding the health risks to children and urged that this issue needed to be addressed immediately by the concerned authorities. 2. The Deputy Headmaster informed the OC that she had previously written to the Early Childhood Care and Education Authority (ECCEA) about this issue and that a request had been made to obtain a water tank. She added that the water tank was delivered to the school recently and that she would be follo wing up on the daily availability of water to the students. 3. The OC also contacted an officer from the ECCEA about this issue. She was informed that the water tank had indeed been delivered at the school and that the CWA would be contacted to ensure that t he pre -primary section was able to benefit from water facilities as soon as possible. 4. The OC updated the complainant about the situation and requested her to contact her Office on any progress in her case. Outcome An Officer of the ECCEA reported to the OC during a follow -up call that the water issue was resolved. This was also confirmed by the Deputy Headmaster of the school. The complainant was updated on the situation by the OCO .

Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 426 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children CASE 22: Mother's request for a job transfer for her twin babies' safety and well - being Nature of the complaint The OC received a complaint from the mother of one -year -old twins who had been working at a secondary school for almost ten years and had just recently received a school transfer letter. Regarding this transfer, she stated that her main challenges were that that she would be posted three days in one school and two days in a different one. She asserted that her husband is also an educator and that the situation is making it hard for her to take care of her twin babies, in particularly dropping them at their nursery which is located far from her new job posting. She informed the OC that the nursery only opens at 7.45 am on weekdays. She was unable to accompany the twins to the nursery at this time owing to the long distance over which she must travel to reach her pla ce of work on time. As a result, the twin babies were being driven to the nursery by their father with no one to attend to them on the way. She reported that this situation was a hazard to the babies' health as any mishap could happen on the road with no adult supervision such as the babies choking, vomiting, playing with the windowpane as well as babies putting small items into their mouths or nostrils and suffocating. She added that it would also be unprofessional for her to be late to her workplace dail y due to travelling over the long distance to the nursery. She emphasised that it is imperative for her to accompany her two babies on the way to the nursery for their own safety as her husband obviously cannot take care of them while driving. Furthermore, the twins' mother informed the OC that she was told by the rector of her new school that she might get a full time posting soon as one of the teachers was supposed to get a transfer. However, the teacher was not transferred. Moreover, the complainant req uested to have a full time posting at a nearer school which would solve her babies' nursery issue. She stated that she had been to the Ministry of Education, Tertiary Education, Science and Technology (METEST) with her request several times and, though an officer there tried his best to help her, no positive outcome had been achieved yet. The twins' mother requested the OC to help her find a solution to her difficult situation. The OC opened an investigation with respect to the children's best interests and right to good health.

The OC addressed a letter to the METEST in connection to the issue. She stated that the recent transfer of the twins' mother to two different schools f ar from her children's nursery is proving to be a major issue for her. The babies require constant attention and, if she had to reach work on time, she would not be able to attend to them during their daily travel to the nursery. Additionally, the lateness was being deducted from her casual leaves. 2. In the best interests of the two infants, the OC requested the METEST to consider the transfer of the mother to a secondary school nearer to the nursery so that she may drop them before attending duty and subsequently be on time at work. Outcome After the confinement, the OC received a response from the METEST that the demand for a transfer was put on hold during the confinement period and that they were looking into the request. The OC notified the complainant accordingly. The mother later contacted the OCO to inquire whether it had received any update from the METEST because there were a few teachers who ha d been transferred recently.

He was aware that the minor lives near his aunt's residence and has even made duplicates of his aunt's house keys before being forced by the police to hand over the original keys. As a result, the minor was able to continue breaking into his aunt's house several times when the latter was not at home.

Despite the intervention of the police, this did not deter the minor from committing more thefts at his a unt's house and, at times, even in front of his aunt's cook. In addition, the minor's acts of vandalism increased and included instances where he stole the car keys, threw rubbish around his aunt's house or even defecated on the floor. The complainant also emphasised that even the police was at a loss about what to do regarding the minor as he was not discouraged by their arrests nor by any complaints against him. The police advised the complainant to talk firmly to both the minor and his parents informing them that his aunt was in close contact with her relatives in case they considered her to be completely alone. Furthermore, the complainant described several other incidents where the minor again broke into his aunt's house to steal her SIM card. On not receiving news from his aunt for a period of time, the complainant visited her house and caught the minor red -handed stealing in the house. He confronted the latter and afterwa rds went to lodge a complaint at the police station, but he did not hear anything back. The complainant was in complete dismay as he affirmed that the law always considers mitigating circumstances so as not to condemn the minor and he was worried that his aunt might Handling of Cases 2019 -2020 | 431 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children never be able to live without the fear of being robbed.

The OC contacted her for further detai ls. The minor's mother stated that the police assisted her thrice, but her husband's family members reported that he was away with their child. However, the complainant stated that she was convinced that her husband had returned to his residence with her c hild. 2. Since the 'Immediate Care and Control ' order was still valid, the OC contacted the police and spoke with an officer about the case. The officer informed the OC that that they would receive the minor's mother at the police station and would provide her with assistance so that she could get her son back. 3. The OC contacted the minor's mother to inform her about the police's response and requested her to give her updates on her situation. 4. After the confinement period, the OC sent a letter to the Commissioner of Police and to the Brigade pour la Protection des Mineurs to formally refer this case to them and requested to be informed of its outcome. Outcome The OC contacted the complainant after the lockdown period for a follow -up. The latter stated that she did not go to the police station but had contacted her attorney about the situation. She reported that she was advised by the attorney to enter a case in Court. The OC reminded the minor 's mother that, as per the Ombudsperson for Children Act 2003, once a case is lodged before Court, the OC cannot intervene in the matter. The minor's mother understood this information and accepted for her case to be closed at the OCO's end.

The complainant explained that the boy had been do ing live videos from the beginning of the lockdown period, which initially seemed fun. She stated that she did not know the minor's age, but the latter appeared to be around ten years old. She also did not know the minor's full name and could only rely on the name attached to his social network profile. However, some people watching his videos had started to make fun of the minor, abusing him through derogatory comments and even asking him to do things like dancing amongst others. The complainant was conc erned about the fact that the child is very young and vulnerable and hence could be a potential target for sexual predators online. She also reported that people were sharing and editing the child's pictures and videos to create humoristic graphics of the child. Additionally, the complainant informed the OC that she at times saw the minor's mother use his social network profile to do live videos where she sang, danced, screamed or talked about absurd things. As a result, there were many in appropriate comments directed to both the mother and son on the live videos. The complainant stated that the mother seemed to be disturbed and that, during one of her live videos, she informed people that her husband recently passed away. The child's mothe r also regularly filmed her youngest son in her videos and the complainant was worried about both boys' well -being. She requested the OC to identify the two children so that it could be assessed whether they were in need of assistance from authorities.

Introduction The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC; United Nations [UN], 1989)99 is the most widely ratified human rights treaty glo bally. However, its implementation varies across political systems used by State parties. For instance, the Republic of Mauritius ratified the UNCRC in 1990 and, since it has a dualist legal system, this international treaty does not automatically enter in to force within our local law. First, the UNCRC has to be enacted through Mauritian legislation in Parliament so that its provisions can be enforced locally. Since the adoption of the UNCRC, the Committee on the Rights of the Child100 regularly produces thematic guidelines, known as 'general comments', to facilitate child rights implementation among State parties. Based on the periodic reports submitted by State parties on the progress made regarding the promotion and fulfilment of children's rights, the Co mmittee also informs them of their concerns and recommendations in the form of 'concluding observations'. In the spirit of furthering the children's agenda, many countries have demonstrated creativity and innovation in coming up with child rights - friendly practices that promote the well -being and empowerment of children. The current chapter illustrates some of these international and local good practices that can serve as potential references when formulating policies and measures related to children's rights. All the local organisations portrayed in section 8.3 of the present chapter have been visited by the Ombudsperson for Children and her team. 99 United Nations (1989).

Some good international practices in enabling the rights of children 8.2.1. Text4baby: Ed ucating women and expectant mothers about health issues through text messages With a view to improve the prenatal and postnatal health of babies and the well -being of their mothers in the United States (US), the country launched for the first time in 2010 a national project for pregnant women and new mothers called 'Text4baby'101. It uses a free text messaging service to provide advice on maternal and child health to these women through three text messages weekly. 'Text4baby' was developed out of a fruitful public -private partnership which included the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); the Voxviva Inc, a private mobile health company; and the National Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Coalition, a group of 100 civil society organisat ions across the US working in the field of maternal and children's health care education. The content of the programme was prepared by all the partners based on their backgrounds in relation to the maternal and child health (Whittaker et al. , 2012)102. For instance, Using evidence -based references such as the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guidelines, the CDC staff, who have expertise in obstetrics, paediatrics, and family and health communication, identified relevant themes for the text messaging service. Informal group discussions with women at six community health centres allowed the Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Coalition to understand their preferences on topics that mattered to them. 101 More information on Text4baby can be accessed on its website ( www.text4baby.org ). 102 Whittaker, R., Matoff -Stepp, S., Meehan, J., Kendrick, J., Jordan, E., Stange, P., et al.

Good Practices in the Implementation of the UNCRC | 441 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children The messages sent to subscribers were ca tegorised into prenatal and postnatal as follows: Prenatal: usual symptoms during pregnancy, when and how to access health care, emotional support for pregnant women, safety, nutrition, smoking, alcohol and drugs, infectious diseases, labour and delivery; and Postnatal: care for the baby, safety, breastfeeding, nutrition and immunisations, among others. Each of these messages includes toll -free numbers that can be used by the pregnant women and new mothers to access maternal and child health services within their local areas. This text messaging project has proved to be particular effective (Whittaker et al. , 2012) because it used the mobile phone as a means of communication that was accessible and at the fingertips of the women. With technol ogical advancement, this service has been made available on social network platforms and also turned into a free application for smartphones. Videos are also uploaded regularly on video hosting platforms such as YouTube to improve the educational experienc e of the women. 8.2.2. The Stark County Family Court in Ohio: A trauma -informed Family and Juvenile Court The success of trauma -informed child welfare systems to treat child traumatic stress has been documented in many scientific publications (e.g. Klain & White, 2013)103. These systems are structured in such a way to provide an understanding of the causes and effects of traumatic experiences as well as practices aiming at supporting recovery. The trauma -informed practices include educating stakeholders eng aged with children and family and providing resources for trauma -specific interventions. These interventions not only treat the symptoms of trauma but also focus on the interplay between trauma and its consequences. This approach provides children a sense of control and hope. It requires the involvement of all stakeholders including caseworkers, lawyers, judges and parents. 103 Klain, E. J. and White, A. R. (2013). Implementing trauma -informed practices in child welfare. United States: S tate Policy and Advocacy Reform Center . Good Practices in the Implementation of the UNCRC | 442 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children The Stark County Family Court (SCFC)104 in Ohio is a nationally recognised model of a trauma -informed family and juvenile court in the United States (Howard & Tener, 2008)105. Led by Judge Michael Howard, a proactive collaboration between the Court system and the local mental health system was established. National experts were hired to educate the Court, child -serving and mental -health personnel on child trauma and to build capacity for trauma -specific services for children. The Stark County Traumatised Child Task Force (SCTCTF) was set up to determine a plan for screening, assessing and providing identified children with the appropriate s ervices. Judge Howard noted that in his capacity as a Juvenile Court Judge, he could enjoy a unique ability to act as a community convener. The SCFC promoted trauma -specific interventions for children and caregivers. Hence, whenever a history of trauma is identified, the child and his caregivers would be referred for a thorough traumatic stress evaluation. For youth involved with the juvenile court system, the court intervenes to support trauma -focused treatment not only with potential delinquency cases bu t also with protection cases in dependency court. Trauma -specific screenings are also offered by the Juvenile Court. Any Court personnel suspecting trauma could refer the child for screening. The Court also changed its approach in screening children. A new screening tool developed by Dartmouth college which incorporated a depression scale and substance abuse screen was adopted by the Court. In order to sustain trauma -informed approaches, Judge Howard and his fellow stakeholders of the SCTCTF proposed that these should be institutionalised. A partnership with the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) was subsequently established to institutionalise trauma awareness in all regional systems that serve children and youth who may be traumatised. It inc luded schools, local Red Cross, Court personnel and Court volunteers, members of probation, child welfare and mental health agencies. As a result of this partnership, tools were developed to sustain trauma -informed practices. A toolkit was developed by the NCTSN, cross -system practices were established, and stakeholders were provided training. Trauma -responsive approaches were integrated in the Ohio Department of Education's Positive Behaviour Intervention Programme. Furthermore, trauma screening and treatm ent were institutionalised in the juvenile justice residential treatment program. 104 More information can be accessed on the website of the SCFC ( www.starkcountyohio.gov/family -court ). 105 How ard, M. L. and Tener, R. R. (2008). Children who have been traumatised: One Court's response. Juvenile and Family Court Journal, 59 (4), 21 -34. Good Practices in the Implementation of the UNCRC | 443 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children This project in Stark County is a model of how the convening power of the judiciary, through a Juvenile Court Judge, can foster trauma -informed dependency and delinquency co urt in partnership with other stakeholders. Successful collaborations across systems were developed and there were fruitful exchanges among professionals of different disciplines in training events and cross -disciplinary meetings. Nationwide, a national co llaboration of the NCTSN, the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, the American Bar Association, and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention led to the publication of collaborative papers, fact sheets, webinars and traini ngs. 8.2.3. Child Friendly Cities Initiative (CFCI)106 The Child Friendly Cities Initiative (CFCI) was launched in 1996 by United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) with a view to support cities, municipalities and communities to realise the rights of childr en at local level. The CFCI has been implemented in over 40 countries and in 3,500 municipalities. 8.2.3.1. What is a child -friendly city? According to the CFCI, a child -friendly city is a place where the rights of children, as spelled out in the UNCRC, are respected and given due consideration. It is also a place where children have a say in the development of their cities. It should operate in accordance with the four overarching principles of the UNCRC and principles of good governance, as liste d below: Four overarching principles of the UNCRC: Non -discrimination Best interests of the child The inherent right to life, survival and development Respect for the views of the child 106 For more information, the UNICEF's website on Child Friendly Cities Initiative can be consulted ( childfriendlyc ities.org ). Good Practices in the Implementation of the UNCRC | 444 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Principles of good governance: Equity and inclusion: A child -friendly city should have equity and inclusion which entail equal opportunities for all children, including children with disabilities, vulnerable children and marginalised children. Barriers to equal opportunities for children should be identifie d and removed. Accountability and transparency: In order to have a child -friendly city, it is vital to identify who is responsible for implementation so as to know who is accountable. The decision -making process should be transparent. Public participatio n: In order to promote accountability, public participation is essential. Different platforms should be provided so that every stakeholder, including children, can get a chance to give their views on matters pertaining to them. Effectiveness and responsiv eness: In order to have a child -friendly city, governments should take all appropriate measures to domesticate the UNCRC. Adaptability and sustainability: Building a child -friendly city requires a flexible management approach in order to be able to antici pate and respond to changing circumstances and be sustainable over time. The Child Friendly City ensures that every child and young person has the right to be valued, respected and treated fairly; is protected from exploitation, violence and abuse; has the right to participate, to be heard and to be involved in decision making process; gets access to quality social services; is able to live in a safe, secure and clean environment with access to green spaces; participates in family, cultural, city/community and social life; and meets friends and has places to play and enjoy themselves.

Case study of Belize One country which has implemented the CFCI is Belize, Latin America's smallest country with a population of 398,454 people (Worldo meter, 2020)107. In 1990, Belize ratified the UNCRC and became duty bound to implement the provisions of UNCRC. Regarding child participation in Belize, there were no formal ways where children could participate in decision -making process. In order to remed y this situation, the UNICEF Belize Country Office created the Sustainable and Child Friendly Municipalities (SCFM) initiative as a way to put into practice the UNCRC and to prioritise child participation at municipal level. The SCFM was launched in Septem ber 2014 and nine municipalities participated in this project. The stakeholders involved in the SCFM were local authorities, civil society, experts, communities and especially children and adolescents. Prior to the launching, there were several consultati ons with stakeholders, mainly municipalities, to reach a consensus on key priorities for the implementation of the initiative. Moreover, the nine municipalities participated in a joint UNICEF -UNDP Rapid Assessment of Belize Local Governments' Capacities to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the role of local government in delivering basic services, designing and implementing local public policies, engaging citizens and promoting citizens' participation. Based on the above, each municipality had to imple ment the SCFM approach by carrying out the following steps: the establishment of a steering committee to ensure that the SCFM initiative and child participation are being carried out; the creation of a Child Advisory Body (CAB); the development of draft m unicipal action plans to highlight the priorities to improve children's lives; and the appointment of a councillor who would act as rapporteur and whose main role was to ensure that SCFM issues are discussed at council meetings. 107 Worldometer (2020).

Retrieved on 10 August 2020 from www.worldometers.info/world -population/ belize -population/ Good Practices in the Implementation of the UNCRC | 446 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children The municipalities were g iven a 3 -year period to implement the initiative so that they could get a chance to become accredited as \"sustainable and child -friendly municipalities\". In order to get this accreditation, one of the key criteria was to promote active child participation. Out of the above - mentioned steps, the creation of the CAB was pivotal in ensuring the latter. The CAB of each municipality included children from various organisations like student groups, NGOs, churches and scout groups who are aged between 8 to 18 years . The CAB also comprised of children from vulnerable categories like those from poor families and those with disabilities. The CAB created a platform whereby children were able to discuss and review municipal plans, budgets and local issues that affect the m. The children participated through different communication platforms such as local talk shows, both on television and radio, WhatsApp, focus group discussions and drawing exercises. The main aims of the CAB included: 1. bringing a child/adolescent perspective to issues affecting children in municipalities to ensure that their rights and needs are reflected in and promoted by municipal plans; 2. facilitating knowledge sharing about best practices and lessons learned for agendas relating to child/adolescent rights, gender equality, and sexual and reproductive health within municipal plans; 3. improving child/adolescent understanding of the principles behind municipal plans and their role in improving young people's lives; and 4. strengthening t he skills of children/adolescents (especially vulnerable and disadvantaged young people) in areas such as leadership, decision -making, communication, problem -solving and advocacy, to facilitate their effective participation in municipal development plannin g. Since the launching of the SCFM, all initiatives, such as anti -bullying campaigns, End Violence against Children campaign and the Communication for Development training on the Zika virus , were organised and planned through SCFM. This ensured that there was child participation on all issues at local level. Through the SCFM and the CAB, children were able to voice out their concerns and it was also a way to hold national officials accountable. CAB members were trained on several issues like trauma recover y methodology and they attended empowerment sessions on the theme \"The Girl Child\". The CAB provided children with the opportunity to be involved in decision -making process. For example, in one Good Practices in the Implementation of the UNCRC | 447 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children municipality, the children voiced out their concerns regarding the upgrade of a local park. They gave their views and suggestions. When their suggestions were accepted, the children were given the chance to assist in the redesign of the park. All municipalities involved in the SCFM initiative were accredited as \"sust ainable and child friendly cities\". It was found that the accreditation framework, acted as an incentive for municipalities to participate in the initiative and promote child participation. 8.2.4. 'Fuji Kindergarten': How architecture is capable of chang ing the lives of children The infrastructure of a school plays an important role on the lives of children because school is where a child spends a significant part of his/her life. It is therefore crucial that the school infrastructure is child -friendly. Fuji Kindergarten is a remarkable example of a child -friendly school environment. It was designed in 2007 by architect Takaharu Tezuka. It is located in the Tachikawa suburb of Tokyo, Japan. In 2017, the Tokyo -based company of Tezuka Architects was awarded the Moriyama RAIC International Prize for the creation of this kindergarten. The RAIC, which stands for Royal Architectural Institute of Canada, awards this prize every two years for works of architecture which are \"judged to be transformative within its societal context and promotes the values of social justice, equality, and inclusiveness.\" (Lynch, 2017)108. Tezuka kept the child and his/her natural instinct at the heart of the design, which is interestingly in line with articles 3 and 12 of the UNCRC wi th regards to considering the children's best interests and their right to express their views freely on all matters concerning them respectively. Tezuka Architects had the vision of children who evolve in open environments filled with background noise and who do not exclude anything or anyone. Their motto was inspired by the fact that \"when the boundary disappears, the constraints disappear\" (Lynch, 2017). 108 Lynch, P. (2017). Tezuka Wins 2017 Moriyama RAIC -moriyama the UNCRC | 448 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children As shown in the picture above, the Fuji Kindergarten is a child -friendly oval -shaped school which accommodates 600 children aged between two and six. Its roof has been set up as an endless play track, where children can run around freely, and trees grow ri ght through classrooms. In the middle of the oval-shaped school, there is a playground. There are slides from the roof where children can get access to the playground. Sliding glazed doors which lined the interior of the school are most of the time open so that there is no barrier between the indoors and the outdoors. There are safety nets around the trees which grow through the classrooms, so that children can climb and play. The architecture of the school has been planned out in such a way that through pl ay, children are encouraged to socialise as well as to be independent. Moreover, the classrooms are open and there are no dividing walls. They are separated by boxes which are made of wood and which are also used as shelves for children to stack their things. The classrooms are designed in such a way that children do not have to sit still and silent for long periods of time. These designs provide a conducive environment where children are able to learn and focus without boundaries. Through its imp ressive architecture, the Fuji Kindergarten also contributes to article 29 of the UNCRC by ensuring a holistic and global education of its children, through its impressive architecture.

Some good local practices that promote children's rights 8.3.1. N\u00e9nuphar Centre at Long Mountain Hospital 8.3.1.1 . Background The upward trend in drug abuse among young people in the Republic of Mauritius is becoming a growing concern for families and the society at large. Factors such as peer pressure and dysfunction al families can make adolescents more vulnerable to drug use, which is evidenced to have adverse long - term effects on their physical, psychological and social development. The Convention on the Rights of the Child (United Nations [UN], 1989)109 makes it clear that: States parties recognize the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and to facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health . State Parties shall strive to ensure that no child is depri ved of his or her right of access to such health care services. (Ibid., art.24, para.1) States Parties shall take all appropriate measures, including legislative, administrative, social and educational measures, to protect children from the illicit use of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances as defined in the relevant international treaties, and to prevent the use of children in the illicit production and trafficking of such substances. (Ibid., art.33) Achieving the highest attainable standard of health for our children is a multi -stakeholder effort, a notion that is supported by the Committee on the Rights of the Child (UN, 2013, para.23)110 as follows: The notion of \"the highest attainable standard of health\" takes into account both t he child's biological, social, cultural and economic preconditions and the State's available resources, 109 United Nations (1989).

A local example of a partnership initiative between the Government and eight NGOs in the detoxification and rehabilitation of young drug addicts under the age of 18 is the N\u00e9nuphar Centre. Nested in the quiet and serene village of Long Mountain , this firs t of its kind project is a residential health care facility that provides counselling services as well as psychological and social support to the young people. It has been opened for admission since 20 August 2018 and was inaugurated at the Long Mountain Hospital on 5 October 2018. The N\u00e9nuphar Centre has an attractive colonial architecture and rustic interior decoration that provide a conducive atmosphere for rehabilitation. The personnel consist of dedicated health professionals who foster a non-judgmenta l and positive attitude to the young people's treatment. As at date, there has been more than 150 admissions to the centre. 8.3.1.2 . Services and treatment offered at the Nenuphar Centre The multi -disciplinary team (MDT) of health professionals consists of 2 Psychiatrists; 1 Medical Officer; 1 Charge Nurse; 5 Nursing Officers; 1 Social Worker/Programme officer; 2 Health Care Assistants; 3 Clinical Psychologists, covering 6 half -day sessions per week; and Support staff from 4 NGOs on different days of t he week. The treatment consists of a blend of pharmacological and psychological therapies combined with alternative therapies offering a holistic approach to treatment. The psychological therapies include motivational interviewing; cognitive behaviour the rapy; behaviour modification; coping strategies; anxiety anger management; and sessions; psychodynamic therapy; general knowledge classes; metaphors in therapy; play therapy, role playing and psychodrama; Good Practices in the Implementation of the UNCRC | 451 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children music ther apy; art therapy; and family therapy and education. Family therapy is usually conducted on Wednesdays and involves participation of family members who are taught how to relate with the patient. They are also informed on how to recognise symptoms indicative of relapse from an early stage. This can help them contact the MDT promptly so that timely interventions can be made. Therapies are conducted both on individual and group bases and are tailored to the individual patient's needs. \"The ideal time to treat such addiction is during adolescence - a time when the brain of the adolescent experiences neuroplasticity . Neuroplasticity, also known as brai n plasticity and brain malleability, is the capacity of the brain to change and adapt during an individual's life.

Indoor recreational activities: These include games like carrom, domino, Scrabble, Monopoly, playing c ards and chess. There is also a treadmill and a gym bicycle for indoor exercise. Outdoor recreational activities: Examples are football, table tennis and gardening sessions among others. Upon discharge, patients are initially followed up in an outpatient setting at the centre, and eventually in the addictology unit nearest to their place of residence. 8.3.2. Lizi\u00e9 Dan La Main: A good practice model in special education 8.3.2.1 . Background All children including those with disabilities have a fundamental right to quality education as enshrined by articles 28 and 29 of the UNCRC and shall enjoy this right without any discrimination and on the basis of equal opportunity. Through regular visits to mainstream and special schools, the Ombudsperson for Children and her team monitor whether the rights of children with disabilities are being respected by all concerned stakeholders. As children with disabilities are very different from one another, parents, teachers and other relevant professionals have to help each individual child to develop their communication, interaction and problem -solving skills in ways that maximise their potential, and to sustain their progress by providing the necessary support. In the Republic of Mauritius, several NGOs operate special e ducation services for children with physical, sensory and/or mental disabilities. One of these NGOs is 'Lizi\u00e9 Dan La Main (LDLM)' which thrives to make a difference in the education of children with visual impairments in Mauritius. Founded in 1981 by a gro up of musicians led by Mr Reynolds Permal and determined to make a positive change, LDLM became a reference in the fight for the welfare and care of visually impaired people in Mauritius. Its vision is to enable every visually impaired person to have a dec ent, respectable and normal life in Good Practices in the Implementation of the UNCRC | 453 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children society, and its mission is to implement activities and projects for the socio -economic integration of persons with visual impairment, including children. Since its foundation, the services of the LDLM have evolved, mo dernised and benefitted a large number of blind and visually impaired people, including vulnerable children, youth and adults from the regions of Port Louis, Sainte Croix, Roche Bois, Cit\u00e9 St Hubert and Flacq. The NGO ensures that the children have a healthy breakfast, lunch and an afternoon tea break when they come to the centre. It works ardently to foster the autonomy of its beneficiaries and open their av enues to employment and economic sustainability. 8.3.2.2 . Services offered by LDLM The services offered by the LDLM aim at the social integration of the blind and partially sighted people to help them lead a life as normal as possible. Admission to the L DLM centre for these individuals is subject to a complete eye examination by an optometrist to determine their visual acuity. This allows for a better referral to the most appropriate services. The main services are described as follows: Pre-primary, prim ary and adult education: Teaching is carried out in enlarged print or through braille. The centre is equipped with the latest technology such as closed -circuit print enlargers, braille transcriber computers and voice generated commands computers. In order to promote inclusive education, the LDLM also has an agreement with the Ministry of Education, Tertiary Education, Science and Technology, whereby visually impaired children can attend school in specialised integrated units within the premises of mainstrea m school. Moreover, the LDLM prepares children for exams at the end of primary education and ensures their admission into colleges or other secondary institutions. Specialised IT classes: IT classes are offered using specialised software such as JAWS and Zoomtext to enable the children with visual impairments to become computer literate. Good Practices in the Implementation of the UNCRC | 454 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Basic literacy: Through this programme, the visually impaired learn how to read and write, communicate properly and perform manual tasks. Orientation and mobility: The LDLM gives considerable importance to building the autonomy of visually impaired individuals. The programme on orientation and mobility includes initiation to the use of the white cane, and basic training of how to move around independently, and accomplish activities of daily living such as cooking. Vocational training: The LDLM provides vocational training to those who could not pursue their mainstream education in different areas such as the making of baskets and picture fra mes, woodwork, 'papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9', pottery and sculpture. Sports: Sports play an important part of LDLM's rehabilitation program. Members of the LDLM are well known for their performance in sports both locally and internationally. Music and dance: The LDLM' s musical band is famous throughout the whole island. This group performs regularly in functions organised at national level. The NGO has a well -equipped sound studio with musical instruments and sound equipment where the musicians do their rehearsals and recordings. Music teaching is also carried out at the centre as a recreational activity. In addition, the school has a 'Sega' group, comprising young singers and dancers, who excel in traditional Sega dance. 8.3.3. L'Odyss\u00e9e du Savoir (Alternative L'Odyss\u00e9e du Savoir L'Odyss\u00e9e du Savoir is an Alternative Elementary School, founded in March 2017. Its teaching and learning processes are inspired by alternative pedagogies from Sudbury, Summerhills and Montessori schools. The school is based at the Medine Education Village campus in Pierrefonds, a nd has 44 students. It focuses on the student's educational empowerment and the development of his autonomy. Good Practices in the Implementation of the UNCRC | 455 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children The child is allowed to develop according to his needs, choices, rhythm and learning style. The school also works in partnership with the NGO Anges du Soleil in Tamarin, which provides education to children who come from vulnerable families. The following are some good practices identified by the OCO at L'Odyss\u00e9e du Savoir which can be used as references to other schools who wish to innovate their pedagogies. 8.3.3.2. Promoting children's need for time and space to play and rest The L'Odyss\u00e9e du Savoir has an alternative curriculum and is not bound by desk learning. The cornerstone of the school is its prevailing democracy and independence that it al locates to the children. Children learn at their own pace and in their own individual ways. The school stresses highly on the need to create time and space for children to indulge in unstructured play, recreation and creativity. Every morning, the childr en are asked to freely choose the 'atelier' or workshop that they wish to go into for the day. An 'atelier' can be, for instance, gardening, Lego programming or attending a Montessori class. As per the rules, each child needs to complete 15 'ateliers' per week. When a child does not want to attend any 'atelier' , they are free to play and indulge in any recreational activity that they want such as craft making. The board (as shown in the picture on the left) provides an overview of the 'ateliers' of the day. The children have the responsibility to register for the activities of their choice in the morning as per the rules. Otherwise, they will not be allowed to participate in the sessions. Good Practices in the Implementation of the UNCRC | 456 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Furthermore, every morning at 09 30 hrs prior to the start of the 'ateliers' , children and educators at the school are encouraged to participate in the \"Anapana\", a meditation technique. Research studies have shown that teaching young children mindful prac tices impacts positively on their brain and behaviours, and improve their attention, self -control and ability to manage stress. It is well -known that play is pivotal to children's cognitive, physical, emotional and social development. The Committee on the Rights of the Child (United Nations, 2013, para.9)111 rightly pointed out that \"[t]hrough their involvement in play and recreation, children learn by doing; they explore and experience the world around them; experiment with new ideas, roles and experiences and in so doing, learn to understand and construct their social position within the world.\" 8.3.3.3. Promoting the right to participate and to be heard In line with article 12 of the UNCRC on the right of the child to express their views freely on matters concerning them, the school takes decisions using a consultative approach with the children. E ach week, a \"conseil de l'\u00e9cole \", comprising of students who have been nominated by other students as 111 Committee on the Rights of the Chi ld (2013). General comment No. 17 (2013) on the right of the child to rest, leisure, play, recreational activities, cultural life and the arts (art. 31) . Geneva: UN. Retrieved on 13 August 2020 from www.refworld.org/docid/51ef9bcc4.html Children practicing the \"Anapana\" meditation technique. Children reported that they feel better when they practice this medit ation. Good Practices in the Implementation of the UNCRC | 457 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children spokesperson and secretary, as well as educators/staff, is held. Matters pertaining to the day -to-day running and recurring problems at the school are add ressed in this meeting. Solutions are then proposed and decisions are taken by vote. For instance, following an incident of a child falling from a tree in the school yard, the \"conseil de l'\u00e9cole\" decided on the remedial safety measures to be taken. The Officer -in-charge of the school and the parents were keen to adopt the measure that no children should be allowed to climb trees. However, after listening to children's views on the matter, it was decided that, instead of prohibiting children to climb tree s, a 'height limit' on the trees should be imposed. The trees were marked with blue and yellow strips indicating safe and unsafe height limits respectively, as shown in the picture below. This solution both ensured children's safety and did not hinder thei r physical development. 8.3.3.4. Promoting the right to education To ensure that all students are enjoying a conducive atmosphere to learning, the school also operates a \"conseil de la justice\" , which comprises a small group of students and staff elected by the \"conseil de l'\u00e9cole\" to monitor the rules and regulations of the school and to process complaints. Any student can lodge a complaint with the \"conseil de la justice\" regarding any violation of the school rules and Good Practices in the Implementation of the UNCRC | 458 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children regulations. The plaintiff describes how and where the incident happened and also states whether there was any witness when it occurred. The \"conseil de la justice\" meets daily to review complaints and subsequently determines whether any given school rule has been violated. If so, the \"conseil de la justice\" presses charges against the person, irrespective of whether it is a student or a staff. For example, if a child is bullied by his classmate, he/she can lodge an official complaint at \"conseil de la justice\" . There has been an instance where this committee rusticated a student when found guilty of bullying his/her classmate. According to the Officer -in-charge of the school, this mechanism has been effective whereby children are better able to take ownership of their actions and they foster more respect for one another. It also empowers them to become ro le models within the school community and responsible adults of tomorrow. This practice at the school corroborates with the following goals of education as outlined by the CRC (UN, 1989, article 29(1) (b&d)): States Parties agree that the education of the child shall be directed to: (b) The development of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and for the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. (d) The preparation of the child for responsible life in a free society, in the spirit of understanding, peace, tolerance, equality of sexes, and friendship among all peoples, ethnic, national and religious groups and persons of indigenous origin. 8.3.4. Strengths of the Brigade pour la Protection des Mineurs (BPM) The BPM has been set up to focus on the protection of the child and to act as a watchdog against child abuse. It aims at providing a safer environment to all children and working with all stakeholders in children's best interests. It has eight departments across Mauritius and 1 office in Rodrigues. The following are a description of some of the identified strengths of the BPM: Good Practices in the Implementation of the UNCRC | 459 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 1. Networking The BPM has established a strong line of communication with the following governmental and non - governmental stakeholde rs in the best interests of the children: (i) Ministry of Gender Equality and Family Welfare (MGEFW); (ii) Ministry of Education, Tertiary Education, Science and Technology (METEST); (iii) Private Secondary Education Authority (PSEA ); (iv) Service Dioc\u00e9sain de l'Education Catholique (SEDEC); (v) Ministry of Youth and Recreation; (vi) Ombudsperson for Children's Office (OCO); (vii) Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions; (viii) Rehabilitation Youth Centres (Boys and Girls); (ix) Tourism Gambling Regul atory Authority; institutions (RCIs) islandwide; and (xiii) The NGO Open Mind. 2. Child -friendly corners in BPM As part of its core values, the BPM has been established to be a child -friendly police unit. Each of its departments in the island consists of a child -friendly corner decorated with mural paintings and aquarium and floral displays. This type of environment enables children to better cope with their anxiety during an interrogation process. 3. Protocol of as sistance to victims of abuse and neglect This protocol was jointly signed by the MGEFW and the Commissioner of Police and is currently being reviewed to provide an improved service to victims of child abuse and neglect and align more with the provisions o f the UNCRC. Good Practices in the Implementation of the UNCRC | 460 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 4. Staff training and team -building There has been an increase in the training programmes for officers of the BPM to enhance their knowledge and sharpen their skills in dealing with children. For instance, officers of the BPM have attended training courses on various themes such as the Commercial and Sexual Exploitation of Children (CSEC), UNCRC, child trafficking, online sexual offences, investigation techniques, Data Protection Act 2017, counselling skills, child psychology, commu nication and public speaking. Moreover, the BPM staff engages in monthly team building activities which improve their team spirit and communication across their departments. The BPM is endeavouring to be a professional law enforcement agency, whilst at the same time, remain children -friendly and collaborate strongly with all relevant stakeholders. 5. Sensitisation programmes at schools The BPM organises regular sensitisation programmes with students of primary and secondary schools on a variety of subjects affecting them such as substance abuse. The officers of the BPM recognise that parents play a key role in the development of their children into future responsible adults. Hence, the BPM has reviewed its sensitisation campaign strategy to more actively inc lude parents and the civil society. These programmes are at times held at shopping malls, food courts and on the streets. 6. Monitoring of cases The BPM closely monitors wherever possible the cases of children whose parents lead unruly lives or are incarcerated and find ways of providing them with the appropriate support. For instance, the BPM ensures that the children are followed by a psychologist, that the school management assists them in their studies, or that they receive social aids from the M inistry of Social Integration, Social Security and National Solidarity where applicable. Feedback is also provided to the Ministries concerned and to the OCO, upon request. Good Practices in the Implementation of the UNCRC | 461 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 7. Crackdown operations Crack -down operations in nightclubs, private clubs, restaurants and in places of public amusement and entertainment are carried out regularly by the BPM to ensure that minors are not illegally allowed in these places. The Officers of the BPM are trained to conduct such operations and take the necessa ry actions. 8. Pilot action research project In 2019, upon the request of the Ministry of Education, Tertiary Education, Science and Technology, the BPM conducted an action research project on a pilot basis with the aim of decreasing violence and behaviour al problems at the Bambous State Secondary School (Boys) and the Swami Sivananda State Secondary School (Girls), both located at Bambous. It seemed that this project helped in reducing the number of cases of student violence and disruptive behaviour at the se schools. 9. Interventions at the National Children Council's (NCC) residential care institutions (RCIs) The BPM often organises musical training for inmates of two RCIs managed by the NCC. It also carries out skills enhancement and painting projects with the inmates of one of these RCIs with the aim of creating a joyful and child -friendly atmosphere. 10. Officers on call Following recurring complaints from the CDU that officers of the BPM were not reachable after office hours, the BPM remedied the situation by weekly procuring to the CDU as well as the OCO a list of officers on call. 11. Using technology for ease of communication The officers have the duty to report their daily activities to the Head of BPM. All the BPM departments, including that of Rodrigues, are connected online via a WhatsApp group where they can easily share information.

Safire and its work in the rehabilitation of children in street situations Founded in 2006, the 'Service d'Accompagnement, de Formation, d'Int\u00e9gration et de R\u00e9habilitation de l'Enfant' (Safire) is one of the very few NGOs in Mauritius that is specifically dedicated to working with children in street situations. Its mission, in line with the provisions of the UNCRC, is to reintegrate and rehabilitate these children into mainstream society as portrayed in its projects described below: 1. Pedagogical Farm - 'Nou Laferm' Since 2012, Safire has reinforced its organisational structure to implement the idea of a pedag ogical farm called 'Nou Laferm', located in St Pierre. Street children are often out of school, unskilled and illiterate. They usually live in conditions of extreme poverty and promiscuity without any supervision or guidance and are particularly vulnerable to many social ills. By giving them an alternative to the streets, the Pedagogical Farm project of Safire aims at reducing the street frequency and delinquency rate of its beneficiaries and increasing their self -esteem, sense of responsibility and discipl ine as well as their environmental consciousness. The farm welcomes an average of 450 children monthly from all around the island. Children are provided with information and are taught skills in different areas such as life skills, literacy, numeracy, values, sexual education, impact of drug abuse, importance of healthy behaviour and sports, behaviour management, child rights, agriculture and farming. Officers of the Anti -Drug and Smuggling Unit and the Brigade pour la Protection des Mineurs are also invit ed as resource persons to speak on relevant issues to the children. The Pedagogical Farm provides cereal, bread, jelly and tea to children in the morning and bread with filling during lunchtime. 2. Street Child World Cup The Street Child World Cup112 is a global movement for street children to raise awareness and overcome the stigma related to this vulnerable group of children. Ahead of each FIFA World Cup, the organisers unite street children from across five continents to play football. They also ge t together at 112 More information on this global event is available on the Street Child United website ( www.streetchildunited.org ). Good Practices in the Implementation of the UNCRC | 463 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children a unique international conference to challenge the negative perceptions and treatment of street children around the world through sports, arts and campaigns. In May 2018, a team of 9 girls were chosen to represent Mauritius in the Street Child World Cup 2018 which was held in Moscow. At this event, the girls pledged that, once they are back to their country, they would establish a plan of action to sensitise other street children on various social issues such as teenage pregnancy, d rug trafficking and the importance of education, amongst others. 3. Cricket World Cup for street children The first Street Child Cricket World Cup113 took place in 2019 in London and Cambridge, ahead of the 2019 Cricket World Cup in England and Wales. Similar to the Street Child World Cup, this event brought together street children from around the world to play in an international cricket tournament t o raise awareness on their situation and rights. Mauritius was one of the national teams represented at this tournament, comprising four boys and four girls from Safire. The children received training to play cricket from the Street Child United. When the Mauritian team members returned to the country, they organised a workshop with 40 street children from all around the island to sensitise them on their rights and responsibilities, the UNCRC and issues such as teenage pregnancy and drug related problems. The 40 participants were then given the responsibility to disseminate this information to other street children of their locality. 4. Referring to the recommendations made by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child Safire is attentive to the recommenda tions made by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child with respect to the issue of children in street situations. They continuously endeavour to devise ways that contribute to the implementation of the provisions of the UNCRC to protect and promote the rights of this group of children, for instance: 1. There is a panel of educators who ensure that the activities and internal policies of the organisation are in line with the UNCRC. 113 More information on the Street Child Cricket World Cup 2019 on the link in the Implementation of the UNCRC | 464 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 2. Before any child starts a programme or activity with Safire, a consent form from a responsible party is compulsory for each beneficiary. The child is also made aware of his/her rights and responsibilities. 3. Staffs members of Safire get regular training on the UNCRC to improve their ways of working with the children. 4. Educators actively listen to children's problems and encourag e them to voice out their concerns to the Child Development Unit if they are victims of abuse and neglect. 5. Each child has a confidential Individual Educational Project based on their specific needs. 5. Good governance As a way of maintaining good governance within the organisation, the board and staff members of Safire meet regularly to review the objectives and strategies of their ongoing and new projects. Safire has written a document that clearly states its values, v ision, and mission, as well as the administrative procedures of the NGO, and its key points are summarised as follows: The Board has a term limit with regular turnover to have new skills and innovative perspectives in the advancement of the organisation' s mission. Board members, staff and volunteers appreciate the need to avoid conflicts of interests and to promote non -discrimination, non -partisan activities and financial transparency in their practices. Safire has an obligation to adhere to all legal emp loyment practices as an NGO and to provide a safe environment for the staff and particularly for the beneficiaries. Safire uses financial resources judiciously and effectively and its fund management is guided by established policies and practices. Safire has an ethical obligation to conduct its activities with accountability and transparency. 6. Success stories One of the major achievements of Safire is that most of its beneficiaries are highly motivated to maintain regular attendance and participation in its activities. This enables the children to benefit fully from their programmes and to gain a certificate of participation at completion. At times, the Good Practices in the Implementation of the UNCRC | 465 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children programmes provide further opportunities to the beneficiaries to visit enterprises where they might be eligible for internships. Some adolescents above the age of 16 years old have already been able to obtain emp loyment in hotels and in the security domain. Another achievement of Safire is the successful reintegration of about 50 children into schools during the period from January 2018 to December 2019.

Governmental bodies, the civil society and the media are in several ways contributing to overcome the spread of the virus and its effects on our society. Being in c onfinement is challenging for many of us, especially children and young people, but nobody can deny that it is a sine qua non for the protection of public health. Most of us have also been more than ever dependent on technology for daily communication, mai ntaining our relationships with others and staying updated with the latest news. Nevertheless, as the Ombudsperson for Children, I am concerned that, during this lockdown period, some minors have engaged in different forms of abuse through social media. F or example, videos of young girls physically fighting in an outrageous manner were circulated, a young person was victim of emotional bullying by being photoshopped as an animal, and another adolescent girl used sexually provocative language on a social me dia platform. I think an important question to ask is, \"where do these behaviours originate from?\" Are we bringing up a generation of children and young people who feel entitled to express themselves in any way they want without any social and moral bounda ries? This situation made me think deeply on the role of education. Academic learning is a core part but only one facet of education. The other complementary side is an education of the hearts of our children and young people, in other words, imbibing th em with core essential values, building their character, and nurturing their emotional intelligence and resilience. Without this aspect, their education will be incomplete. A piece of paper can certify their academic merits, but I believe that the true tes t of their education lies in how they respond to daily problems, uncertainty and life's challenges. One of the most influential scientists of the 20th century, Albert Einstein, interestingly said that, \"education is what Appendices | 481 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children remains after one has forgotten wha t one has learned in school\" . It is therefore primordial that, along with producing a generation of children who can read, write and count, we need to ensure that they are internalising lifelong values such as honesty, compassion, perseverance and service to others. In this context, a paradigm shift in the minds of people, especially of our children and young people, is warranted. History impacts on the lives of children, but we should not forget that children are also active participants in the making of history. It is more than ever necessary that the child of the 21st century learns to view education not merely as a utility for career progression, but as a transformative tool. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO; 2019)114 spells this out powerfully, \"education transforms lives and is at the heart of...build[ing] peace, eradicat[ing] poverty and driv[ing] sustainable development.\" I think that the COVID -19 pandemic can act as a springboard for children and young people to be educated beyond their books and learn pedagogically active skills that can empower them to become engaged actors in social transformation. In the current article, I give a brief overview of the COVID -19 situation in relation to children's rights. I then propose some methods on how we can lean on the lessons of this global pandemic to enhance the creativity, understanding of values and character -building of children and young people in Mauritius. An overview of the COVID -19 local situation from a child's rights perspective The COVID -19 pandemic is an unprecedented public health emergency that is shaping cultures, generations and history all across the world. While some countries have not yet reached the peak of this crisis, the situation in others appears to be m ore hopeful. Following a plateauing of new COVID -19 cases over the last few days, Mauritius can be considered as one of those countries that might experience a positive turning point in the near future characterised by the gradual disappearance of novel ca ses of the virus and an increase in the number of healed cases. As the country enters a recovery phase, each one of us is having to redefine and plan at both individual and organisational levels how 114 United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (2019). Education transforms lives.

Nationa l prevention strategies are also being designed to avoid as far as possible other waves of the spread of this virus. We cannot ignore that, to some extent, the confinement period has had adverse effects on the physical, psychological, emotional and social wellbeing of our children and young people, particularly the most vulnerable ones. Many of them would remember the day they woke up in the morning and were suddenly not permitted to go to school, play with their friends or visit their favourite parks and places. In a publication by the Committee on the Rights of the Child (2020)115, they recognised that \"in crisis situations, international human rights law exceptionally permits measures that may restrict the enjoyment of certain human rights in order to pro tect public health. However, such restrictions must be imposed only when necessary, be proportionate and kept to an absolute minimum.\" It is important to highlight that, relative to some of the recommendations of this Committee (2020), the country has done well in the domain of children's rights during the confinement period, for instance: The best interests of children in relation to health and safety have been taken into consideration by decreasing their exposure to the virus through the lockdown. Childre n are still having access to indoor leisure activities at home and supervised outdoor activities in their yards. Children are spending more time with their family or other significant adults which can improve their emotional wellbeing. Responsible adults a re facilitating opportunities for children to use their imagination to occupy their time and express their creativity on paper and through social media. Children are regularly expressing themselves through pictures and messages regarding the COVID -19 situa tion on the media. The Ministry of Education, Tertiary Education, Science and Technology has organised academic teaching through online platforms and television for students. Many vulnerable families where children also live are provided with food packs du ring the confinement. 115 Committee on the Rights of the Child (2020).

Healt h hotlines are available so that parents can enquire on any health concerns for their children. They can also access health care centres/hospitals when necessary. The Child Development Unit (CDU) hotline remains operational during the lockdown to intervene in any case of child abuse. During the confinement, the Ombudsperson for Children's Office has remained available and contactable through my staff members and I. We received several phone calls and emails from various individuals and organisations. We pr ovided them with advice and made referrals to the authorities where appropriate. In addition, we facilitated an online messaging and email support group with the Managers of RCIs. I spoke with children in some RCIs through video conferencing as well as car ried out site visits when necessary. I was also solicited by several media platforms where I had the opportunity to discuss on the situation of children within the COVID -19 context. My office is currently collecting information on the experiences of variou s groups of children during the pandemic through interviews which will be published in our upcoming annual report. Educating the hearts of children and young people Values are \"the principles that help [us] to decide what is right and wrong, and how to act in various situations\" (Cambridge Dictionary, 2020)116. Some examples are compassion, love, honesty, tolerance, respect and simplicity. Inculcating values to our children and young people is a crucial part of their holistic education. The fourteenth Dal ai Lama rightly stated that: Modern education is premised strongly on materialistic values. It is vital that when educating our children's brains that we do not neglect to educate their hearts, a key element of which has to be the nurturing of our compass ionate nature. 116 Cambridge Dictionary (2020). Values. UK: Cambridge University Press. Retrieved on 20 April 2020 from dictionary.cambridge.org/ dictionary/english/values Appendices | 484 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children Value -based education requires dynamic and experiential teaching and learning processes which need to be adapted to the age, ability and maturity level of the students. Active pedagogical methods can be very useful in achieving this aspect of education within the school curriculum. Some examples are outlined as follows: 1. Story -telling: This is a powerful and engaging technique to help children of any age make sense of their world. It encourages children to use their imagination and open up their minds to a wealth of possibilities. Stories also carry meaningful messages on values that children can learn and adapt to their daily lives. In the context of the COVID -19, every child has a narrative to tell verbally or non -verbally on how t hey lived through this phase. Story -telling can enable them to connect with their experiences, and understand and express their feelings in a safe way. 2. Film/video viewing with interactive discussions: Films or videos can be a highly engaging way for students to learn about various themes. Educators could use the COVID -19 situation as a basis to learning on how the world overcame previous challenges such as the HIV/AIDS and Flu pandemics, plagues and world wars. Students can become more aware of exampl es of human solidarity and generosity during difficult times. All film/video viewings could be followed with interactive age -appropriate discussions to facilitate children's understanding of the themes and to allow them to think on how they can practically contribute to make the world a better place. 3. Quality debates with secondary school students: Organising quality debates with secondary school students on world issues such as the COVID -19 and the adverse impact of human actions on the environment can enhance their critical thinking skills, their capacity to evaluate situations and draw out learning points, their leadership skills, as well as their engagement towards the world they live in. Appendices | 485 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 4. Performing arts as a vehicle for value -base d learning: Theatre, music and dance are different types of performing arts that could be used in the school curriculum to encourage students to creatively express their views and feelings on situations that matter to them, including their experiences dur ing the COVID -19 pandemic. Using their voices, bodies or instrumental sounds as media of expression, students can deepen their understanding of the theme and develop empathy for those who are affected by difficult situations. Initiating short - film developm ent projects with students of different ages could also be considered as an innovative way of learning about global challenges including pandemics and climate change through acting. These methods can also improve students' team spirit, self -confidence, and their views on themselves, others and the world. 5. Developing an eco -friendly mentality among students: In various parts of the world, environmentalists have noted that the lockdown situation has had notable positive effects on the environment such as a decrease in air pollution, a reduction in wastes and the replenishing of some marine ecosystems among others. In schools, educators could expand the environmental consciousness of their students through creative eco -friendly projects where students can learn how to buy according to their needs and not excessive wants or greed, and avoid buying products that are damaging to the environment; review the amounts of products they buy for their personal use and whether they can use less of them; be sensitised to replace single -use items with reusable ones such as reusable water bottles and washable handkerchiefs; and learn to recycle paper, plastic, glass, metal, food wastes and fabrics into other useful products, for example, preparing compost for g rowing vegetables at home or in the school yard or using scrap fabric to sew face masks. Developing their environmental consciousness can help students build resilience in the face of challenges such as a confinement period and learn to be grateful for wh at they possess. Appendices | 486 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children 6. Volunteering support for vulnerable groups of students: The COVID -19 pandemic could be used as an opportunity for students to develop volunteering initiatives at the level of their schools to help vulnerable groups of people. Obviously, until our country is completely clear of the coronavirus, these projects will have to conducted within the remit of all sanitary restrictions. For instance, school staff and students could donate food, products and school materials, and prepare packs for needy students and their families. The distribution of these packs could be carried out with the help of the police. In addition, older or university students could create small mentoring groups on online platforms to provide learning support to vulnerable groups of students such as those with special educational needs or disabilities or those who live in residential care institutions. These actions can enable students to experience and learn on the importance of solidarity and helpfulness, and on their rol e in making a difference in the lives of their less privileged friends. I would like to conclude that there is no doubt that Mauritian children and young people are going through an emotionally challenging phase of history. They can have varying levels of coping mechanisms to stressful external events depending on their age, maturity, education and family situation among others. In this respect, our education system can play a central role in channelling their emotions and behaviours towards responsible actions and constructive solutions for the betterment of their communities and the society at large. I reiterate that the COVID -19 pandemic is a rich opportunity to cultivate the character and resilience of our current generation of young people.

Main activities MFPWA had started as a grass -root movement in the late 1950's promoting birth control programme in the country. Over the years, t he MFPWA has adopted a holistic approach to reproductive health, and has extended its services to cater for all men and women, in preparation for reproductive life, in active reproductive life and beyond. Hence, besides contraceptive information and services to men and women in the reproductive ages, the Association also caters for babies, pre-pubertal boys and girls, adolescents, menopausal women, the elderly as well as people with different sexual orientations. The MFPWA has a commitment to serving all segments of the population. The Officers of the Association supported by volunteers an d a team of trained teachers implement sexuality education in schools and parenting education sessions to sensitise them on their roles and responsibilities and the challenges affecting the youth. The Association provides sexuality education to about 15,00 0 in and out of school students yearly to bring behaviour change and make them responsible citizens as well as protect themselves from unwanted teenage pregnancies and unprotected sex, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, drug addiction and negative peer influence. The programmes target vulnerable groups mainly youth and adolescents. MFPWA undertakes information, education, communication and behaviour change programme. The Association has put in place condom distribution machines around the island but not properly serviced by partners who have taken over. They intend to introduce a modern youth friendly service to attend to the needs of the adolescents but due to logistical constraints they are not able to implement the project at a large scale.

Mission The prevention and alleviation of teenage pregnancy distress Main activities 1. Accompany teenage pregnant mothers: MAM's supportive action prepares young pregnant girls and women into motherhood with a positive mindset. In -house sessions animated by two midwives of the MAM's team are held at the Centre pour la Vie. Instead of being idle during their pregnancy, partici pants learn about self -care, health, hygiene, delivery, childcare and breastfeeding. MAM believes that babies raised in a positive atmosphere are given the best chances to live a happy life. 2. Empower young mothers with a diploma in child care: Owing to early pregnancy, some teenage girls have done little schooling and do not have adequate qualifications. Having to look after their child, they do not have much opportunity to learn skills and find jobs that will help them become financially auton omous. Proper training in childcare helps them become better mothers, and provides them with the possibility of finding a job. MAM has for the last seven years been holding weekly courses with qualified educators from La Cr \u00e8che de Bethlehem and they traine d around 150 mothers to obtain their diploma in childcare. 3. Educate teenagers to a positive attitude towards sexuality: Sessions are held in villages with the teenagers, both boys and girls, on the theme 'Pran letan pou kontan'. The objectives of the works hops are to (i) speak about sexuality in a healthy and positive way; (ii) provide information on problems entailed by early pregnancies; (iii) foster respect of life and encouraging responsible sexual behaviour; (iv) develop awareness of risks and diseases associated with irresponsible sexual behaviour. Parents are also invited to join the sessions to encourage open dialogue within the family. Another programme entitled 'Maman Soleil' promotes happy families by strengthening family ties, encouraging and fac ilitating dialogue among members of the family and better communication.

Bad housing is linked to debilitating and even fatal, illnesses and accidents. 1. Children in overcrowded housing are up to 10 times more likely to contract meningitis than children in general. Meningitis can be life threatening. Long -term effects of the disease include deafness, blindness and behavioural problems. 2. There is a direct li nk between childhood tuberculosis (TB) and overcrowding. TB can lead to serious medical problems and is sometimes fatal. 3. Children living in overcrowded and unfit conditions are more likely to experience respiratory problems such as coughing and asthmatic wheezing. For many children this means losing sleep, restricted physical activity, and missing school. 4. Overcrowded conditions have been linked to slow growth in childhood, which is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease in later life. 5. Almost half of all childhood accidents are associated with physical conditions in the home. Families living in properties that are in poor physical condition are more likely to experience a domestic fire. On mental health Homeless children are three to four times more likely to have mental health problems than other children. Mental health issues such as anxiety and depression have also been linked to overcrowded and unfit housing. Appendices | 514 Annual Report 2019 -2020 Ombudsperson for Children On education Bad housing affects chil dren's ability to learn at school and study at home. 1. Homeless children are two to three times more likely to be absent from school than other children due to the disruption caused by moving into and between temporary accommodation. 2. Children in unfit and o vercrowded homes miss school more frequently due to illnesses and infections. 3. Overcrowding is linked to delayed cognitive development, and homelessness to delayed development in communication skills. 4. Homeless children are more likely to have behavioural p roblems such as aggression, hyperactivity and impulsivity, factors that compromise academic achievement and relationships with peers and teachers. It is unsurprising that homeless children have lower levels of academic achievement that cannot be explaine d by differences in their levels of ability. On opportunities in adulthood The lower educational attainment and health problems associated with bad housing in childhood impact on opportunities in adulthood. 1. Long -term health problems and low educational attainment increase the likelihood of unemployment or working in low -paid jobs. 2. Opportunities for leisure and recreation are undermined by low income and health problems. 3. The behavioural problems associated w ith bad housing in childhood can manifest themselves in later offending behaviour. In one study, nearly half of young people who had offended had experienced homelessness.
