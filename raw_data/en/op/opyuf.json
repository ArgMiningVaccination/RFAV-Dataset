Traditional Chinese Medicine is based on a concept of balanced qi, or vital energy, that is believed to flow throughout the body. As one of the oldest systems of medicine, its origins can be traced back over 3,500 years. While western medicine focuses mainly on treating disease, TCM looks at your entire wellbeing. TCM practitioners use a mix of mind and body practices such as acupuncture, cupping, meditation, tai chi, and various herbal products to address health problems whilst creating harmony and a healthy flow of that all-important qi. In TCM, qi is the body's vital energy and must flow unimpeded for the body to function normally. Any disruptions in the qi can manifest in physical and mental health issues such as lethargy, cold and flu symptoms, fever, cough, depression and anxiety.
