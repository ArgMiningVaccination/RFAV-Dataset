Fortunately, the human body can also eliminate toxins in a variety of ways. Healthcare professionals have recognized that the accumulation of toxins in the human body can cause numerous health issues, including inflammation which may lead to back pain and sciatica. A good detox plan can help improve your overall health and wellness from the inside. Detoxing is also a fundamental process which can help relieve sciatica and back pain. Back Pain and Sciatica Back pain is one of the most common health issues reported among the general population. Although back pain affects approximately 80 percent of people at least once throughout their lifetime, sciatica continues to be one of the most frequently misunderstood health issues across the world. Also known as sciatic nerve pain, sciatica is characterized by irritation or inflammation due to the compression or impingement of the sciatic nerve, the longest and largest nerve in the human body. The sciatic nerve travels from the lower back, down the hips and buttocks, into the legs and feet. A variety of alternative treatment options, such as chiropractic care, can help safely and effectively treat sciatica symptoms without the side-effects of drugs and/or medications. Many healthcare professionals may recommend the use of drugs and/or medications to help offer sciatic nerve pain relief, however, these are only managing the symptoms rather than treating the health issue at the source. Research studies demonstrated that 76 percent of patients with sciatica reported complete relief of their symptoms without any toxic side-effects after following a detox plan for 45 days. Detox for Sciatica and Back Pain For those people who may not be sure how or where to start with a detox plan, it's fundamental for you to know that you can detox the human body on a variety of levels. First, you can start off with a simple foot detox. Healthcare professionals have demonstrated that a detox foot bath is a good way to cleanse the human body. Best known as the BioElectric Field Enhancement Unit, this helps generate positive and negative ions which creates the pH balance in the human body. As a result, the human body's negative ions decrease while the human body's positive ions increased to provide pain relief. To perform a detox foot bath, soak your feet for 30 minutes in warm salt water together with the foot coil. This process can help give muscles the strength and endurance they need to deal with back pain and sciatica symptoms. Moreover, a detox foot bath can also help eliminate free radicals which enhance range of motion. A detox foot bath also supports circulation. A good detox plan to help improve sciatica and back pain can also include following proper nutrition. Healthcare professionals can recommend a diet food plan which can help detox the human body from the inside with other treatment approaches. As previously mentioned, nutrition and lifestyle modifications below can help cleanse and detox the human body, including: - Drinking more water, at least a minimum of two liters a day. - Drinking freshly squeezed juices without adding sugar, several times a day. - Replacing one meal with fresh smoothies, preferably breakfast. - Eating a healthy diet without processed foods, red meat, sugar, and dairy products. According to healthcare professionals, it is a healthy practice to follow a detox plan once every 3 to 4 months. Do you remember when was the last time you had a detox? Or do you at least remember ever having a moment where you considered detoxification? Whether you followed a detox plan a few months ago, a year ago, several years ago, many years ago or simply never, it doesn't matter. There is no better time then to start now. A detox plan cleanses the bloodstream, improves gut health, channels energy levels and strengthens muscles. Detox helps improve sciatica from its source. Sciatica is a collection of symptoms which can manifest due to a variety of underlying health issues. However, numerous research studies have demonstrated that following a detox plan can help tremendously reduce irritation and inflammation associated with sciatic nerve pain. Following a proper nutrition and lifestyle modifications together with a detox plan can ultimately help improve overall health and wellness, including sciatica and back pain. - Dr. Alex Jimenez D.C., C.C.S.T.
