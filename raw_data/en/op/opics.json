The paper generated a great deal of press coverage at the time, with headlines such as \" [HIV Hides Out in Bone Marrow Cells](http://www.businessweek.com/lifestyle/content/healthday/636732.html)\" and multiple outlets featuring interviews with Collins describing the findings. Today in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, the laboratory of Bob Siliciano at Johns Hopkins\u2014which has been investigating HIV persistence and latency since the mid-90s\u2014offers compelling evidence that HIV infection of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells is an extremely rare event (if it occurs at all). The study authors, led by Christine Durand from the Siliciano lab, show that HIV can be detected in some CD34+ cell preparations from individuals on ART due to contamination of the samples by HIV-infected CD4+ T cells. In contrast, no evidence of HIV infection could be found in highly purified CD34+ cells from any of their 11 study participants. The researchers write: \"We can conclude that in the majority of HIV-1 subtype-B-infected patients on ART, the frequency of HIV-infected CD34+ is <0.002%. These conclusions extend a large body of clinical and translational data reported over the past 2 decades, indicating that CD34+ cells do not constitute a significant reservoir for HIV-1 in vivo.\" Durand and colleagues suggest that the previous results reported in Nature Medicine are most likely explained by low-level contamination of CD34+ cell preparations with HIV-infected CD4+ T cells.

In addition to resting CD4+ T cells, CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells have been proposed as another reservoir. We obtained bone marrow aspirates from 11 patients on ART who had undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA. HIV-1 DNA was detected in CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood in all patients and from bone marrow cellular fractions containing T cells in most patients. We did not find HIV-1 DNA in highly purified CD34+ populations using either a sensitive real-time polymerase chain reaction assay or a coculture assay for replication-competent HIV-1. "}
