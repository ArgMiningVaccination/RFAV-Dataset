Our hero herb yarrow (Achillea Millefolium), is shrouded by tales of folklore and can be found beside hedgerows all across the UK. The miraculous powers of this humble herb have been used for millennia to heal and repair. Named after Greek hero Achilles, who legend has it, used it to heal his soldiers' wounds after battle. Our original product The Green Balm continues this age-old tradition of using yarrow as a healing herb and this calming, multi-purpose balm can be used for all manner of skin ailments. Made with carefully selected botanical ingredients to improve wellbeing and to practice a simple, yet effective daily skin care ritual. MOA formulas are cruelty free, do not use petrochemicals (mineral oil), parabens, SLS, phthalates, fillers or artificial fragrance and our newer products are entirely plant based and suitable for vegans. We always strive to work in harmony with mother nature, each product is considered mindfully and consciously, sourcing as much of our packaging from the UK using recycled board and printed with vegetable inks. We encourage recycling and re-using our packing, whilst we actively seek to reduce the use of plastic where possible. "}
