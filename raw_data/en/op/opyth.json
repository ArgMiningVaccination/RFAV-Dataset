Likewise, the seed of disease comes back to the concept of ma, toxins. Balanced agni is the key to proper digestion, assimilation of nutrients, sustained energy, healthy aging, and maintaining homeostasis. Quality agni can prevent, ma from forming and burn existing impurities that are stagnated within the body and mind. Ayurveda looks at a human being from the lens of abundance. In Ayurveda, perfect health is not simply an absence of disease but rather an abundance of vitality.

The three doshas are naturally dynamic, which means that they constantly respond to changes in your life. The biggest changes occur seasonally, and summer is the season when Pitta dosha is strongly affected, because heat and humidity are two qualities that summer shares with Pitta, which is warm and moist. Summer heat can easily aggravate Pitta, so you want to pay special attention during this season. Keeping our doshas balanced is an important part of maintaining a healthy body and mind throughout the entire year. Seasonal shifts are big news in the world of Ayurveda and can cause doshic imbalances if we aren't honoring their cycles and living accordingly. While the summer season is a magical time of year, it is also Pitta season, and if we don't adjust our diets and lifestyle to keep Pitta at bay, we risk accumulating excess heat in the body. A Pitta imbalance can show up as anger, irritation, loose stools, acid reflux, skin disorders, and more.

As the days get longer and the air gets warmer, we're all looking forward to bringing in some fresh summer energy. When summer begins to take over, we welcome Pitta season. Pitta is one of the three Ayurvedic Doshas, and it governs the summer season. Creativity is an inherent quality of being human. Everywhere within us, in every cell and atom, is the creative energy of the entire universe. This energy is creating new cells and tissues every day, as well as allowing for new ideas and inspirations. When it comes to concentration, sometimes we need a little bit of support. There are many reasons why it may be hard for you to concentrate. It could be due to stress, lack of sleep, nutrition deficiencies, or doshic imbalances. The good news is that Ayurveda can offer us relief naturally. If you feel foggy, distracted, or unable to focus, incorporating Ayurvedic herbs into your lifestyle may be a good idea. When we find meaning and purpose in our daily activities, we experience vitality in our lives. We have access to an abundant source of energy, and we feel joy and passion in all aspects of our lives. When we are able to express our unique gifts and talents, while contributing to the happiness of others, we feel happy and fulfilled. Ayurveda is the traditional healing system from India that is literally translated as 'the science of life.' Through healthy daily practices and aligning with natural rhythms, one can prevent disease and create health on a daily basis. And although the outcome of Ayurvedic lifestyle and medical treatment is a healthy body and mind, the true aim of Ayurveda is to connect us to a deeper experience of who we are. "}
