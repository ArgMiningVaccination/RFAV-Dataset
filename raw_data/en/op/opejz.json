Food and Nutrition 2012 Physiology & Behavior 2008 2014 Beta-glucans are a heterogeneous group of natural polysaccharides mostly investigated for their immunological effects. Due to the low systemic availability of oral preparations, it has been thought that only parenterally applied beta-glucans can modulate the immune system. However, several in vivo and in vitro investigations have revealed that orally applied beta-glucans also exert such effects. Various receptor interactions, explaining possible mode of actions, have been detected. The effects mainly depend on the source and structure of the beta-glucans. In the meantime, several human clinical trials with dietary insoluble yeast beta-glucans have been performed. The results confirm the previous findings of in vivo studies. The results of all studies taken together clearly indicate that oral intake of insoluble yeast beta-glucans is safe and has an immune strengthening effect. Frontiers in Immunology Frontiers in Nutrition PLoS ONE 2014 European Journal of Clinical Nutrition 2002 Nutrients Immune health products represent approximately 10% of all US dietary supplement sales. Claims made on products to support or boost the immune system are attractive to the otherwise healthy consumer who may or may not be experiencing certain life stressors. The purpose of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the purported benefits and/or potential harms of select dietary supplement ingredients frequently listed on the labels of products having immune health or related market claims. With a focus on resilience, research questions were related to whether dietary supplement ingredients are efficacious in preserving and protecting immune health in healthy individuals; and when faced with a stressor, whether taking a supplement prophylactically can assist in maintaining health and resisting or bouncing back more quickly. Thirty-nine randomized controlled studies involving populations including children, adults and seniors exposed to stressors, such as air travel, intense exerc... Background: Fatigue is attributable to physical and psychological stress. Fatigue is also a common symptom which occurs in both sick and healthy individuals. Although its mechanism of cause is complex, fatigue from stress is known to affect the existing equilibrium of the immune system. However, nutrition, such as beta-1,3/1,6 glucan, has been reported to play an important role in regulating stress and fatigue states, via modulating a weakened immune system. In this study, a popular and healthy beverage in Okinawa, Japan, containing a soluble baker's yeast in black koji vinegar (Moromisu), was provided to healthy subjects with a non-strenuous daily lifestyle. Results: By performing statistical analysis on the results of the Profile of Mood States (POMS) survey, we observed that overall study results (n=14) demonstrated significant differences in fatigue and confusion in the POMS factors. Conclusions: In this study we confirmed that beta-1,3/1,6 glucan improved some of the factors related to stress and fatigue, as indicated by evaluation of POMS survey results. International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences In literature, -glucan is abundantly found in oats and currently used as well as tested against various varieties of food products. The objective of our study is to evaluate its immune-boosting potential of -glucan extracted from oats and tested against specific protein antigen i.e., bovine serum albumin (BSA) and also measure its antioxidant activity. For these studies, -glucan using variable concentration and tested in human whole blood samples (exposed with an optimized concentration of bovine serum albumin, BSA) and examined its immune-boosting potential. In contrast, estimation of Th1 (IFN-gamma) and Th2 (IL-4) cytokines were also measured from cell culture supernatant and also measured its antioxidant potential through DPPH assay. The results showed that -glucan enhanced immune-boosting activity in a concentration-dependent manner against BSA. In contrast, there is enhancement in Th2 (IL-4) cytokines in a dose-dependent manner, but there is no significant effect in Th1 (IF... Loading Preview Sorry, preview is currently unavailable.
