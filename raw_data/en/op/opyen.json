At [Boulder Sports Chiropractic](/home), we believe that even your smallest joints play an integral role in your body's overall movement. Having balanced joints prevents local inflammation, early degeneration and injury throughout the body. Chiropractic treatment also improves your physical performance and wellness by avoiding inefficient joint movements which often leads to dysfunctional muscle compensation patterns. We believe that chiropractic care is an affordable, safe and effective approach for treating and helping many different health issues and sports related injuries. That is why we are one of the top and [most trusted Chiropractors in Boulder, CO](/about). We are a locally owned sports chiropractic clinic and we look forward to helping you increase the quality of your life through our services. Prior to the chiropractic adjustment, joint movements throughout the entire body are evaluated to determine if any joint restrictions are present. Adjustments are administered to restricted joints through a variety of different techniques dependent upon the patient's preference and comfort levels. The common adjustment typically includes a very shallow thrust which may or may not result in an audible \"pop\" or cavitation. This sound is created by the movement of \"air bubbles\" naturally located within our joint/synovial fluid. Our appointments are longer than your traditional chiropractor. We spend 1 hour with you on your first visit to fully identify the problem, explain why the problem happened, and give you our best recommendations for fixing it before getting into treatment. Our follow up visits are 20 minutes in length to allow us to work on muscles with various techniques before doing the traditional adjustments. Chiropractic adjustment benefits include: Restoration of restricted joint motion Improves nutrition to vertebral discs and joint cartilage Pain relief Reduces muscle spasms and tightness Improves alignment of new scar tissues Stimulate nervous system for improved sympathetic/parasympathetic response Chiropractic for Sports Injuries At Boulder Sports Chiropractic, our chiropractors are certified chiropractic sports physicians.
