Maybe you've been curious. You stop and wonder because preventative care sounds too good to be true. But never in your life have you thought of seeing a doctor outside your conventional family physician. Naturopathic doctors are for full-blown granola crunchers! You don't know if seeing an ND is right for your family. Mama, you're not alone! Before I made the decision to attend naturopathic medical school, my thoughts on healthcare went only as far as wanting the best care for my family. Just like you. I became frustrated when my health questions weren't getting answered. And my children's conditions weren't improving through the conventional model. I didn't want to... - See another specialist. - Run more lab tests. - Try another medication. - Explain our struggles over and over only to leave again without clear steps to a cure. Can you relate? This is what's led me down the path I'm on today. I'm over-the-moon excited to share with you what-in-the-heck naturopathic medicine is and how it may be a blessing for your family. What Is Naturopathic Medicine? Naturopathic medicine blends traditional techniques with modern medicine. We use modern science paired with traditional techniques to help our patients not only feel better but truly heal. For example, a diagnostic lab test may confirm a C. difficile infection, and our course of treatment may be a combination of herbs, supplements, and therapies rather than antibiotics. Let's take a closer look at what healing actually looks like using naturopathic medicine. Naturopathic Pediatric Treatment The goal of a naturopathic doctor isn't to treat only symptoms. We want to understand the root cause and work towards overall healing. Healing requires... - Looking at the whole person. - Finding the unique medicine they need. - Guiding them through the process of removing obstacles so their body can heal itself. At The Organic Cure, we craft a treatment plan customized to your child \u2014 no one else's. Because each of our kiddo's bodies are different. Naturopathic treatment involves using non-toxic, non-invasive methods that help with healing from the inside out. We tend to use supplements and other remedies for a period of time, but not to create a dependency. Instead, we use them as a tool to restore weakened systems while we work on building a healthy lifestyle that will help maintain your child's health in the long run. What is a Naturopathic Pediatrician? A Naturopathic Doctor is educated at one of the five worldwide naturopathic medical universities. We are trained physicians who can diagnose, prevent, and treat acute and chronic illness. Our ultimate goal is to establish optimal health by guiding the body to heal itself. We recognize symptoms as signs of underlying illness and focus on healing the root cause rather than just suppressing symptoms. We develop personal relationships with our patients so we can develop personalized treatment plans that lead to transformational health outcomes. We are innovators, advocates, and fearless practitioners who challenge the status quo and continuously strive to improve the standard of care for the people we serve. What Naturopathic Do Naturopathic Pediatrician's Do? The practice of naturopathic medicine includes many modalities. I use non-harmful methods to encourage the body to heal itself. These are the tools in my naturopathic pediatrician toolbox: - Supplements: high-quality nutraceuticals replenish deficiencies and encourage proper function. - Homeopathy: this powerful yet gentle form of medicine is especially great for kids because it is low risk and they love the taste. - Herbal medicine: plants work synergistically with the body to perform multiple functions a the same time. - Healing touch: I make sure every physical exam is gentle and incorporate craniosacral therapy to guide the body into alignment. - Clinical Nutrition: We go beyond the basics to tailor a diet that is specific to your child's healing process, eliminating what is harmful and emphasizing the nutrients they need most - Lab testing: From basic blood work to highly specialized functional testing, we use modern diagnostic tools to point to the root cause so we can optimize results. What does a Naturopathic Pediatrician's Believe? Naturopathic pediatrician's adhere to a strict code of conduct known as our core principles: - First Do No Harm (Primum Non Nocere): The naturopathic physician follows three guidelines to avoid harming the patient: - Uses methods and medicinal substances which minimize the risk of harmful side effects - Uses the least force necessary to diagnose and treat; avoid when possible the harmful suppression of symptoms - Acknowledges, respects, and works with individuals' self-healing process - The Healing Power of Nature (Vis Medicatrix Naturae): The naturopathic physician recognizes an inherent self-healing process in people that is ordered and intelligent. The naturopathic physician acts to identify and remove obstacles to healing and recovery, and to facilitate and augment this inherent self-healing process. - Identify and Treat the Causes (ToIle Causam): The naturopathic physician seeks to identify and remove the underlying cause(s) of illness rather than to merely eliminate or suppress symptoms. - Doctor as Teacher (Docere): The naturopathic physician educates patients and encourages self-responsibility for health. The physician also recognizes and employs the therapeutic potential of the doctor-patient relationship. - Treat the Whole Person (Tolle Totem): The naturopathic physician treats each patient by taking into account individual physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social, and other factors. Since total health also includes spiritual health, the naturopathic physician encourages individuals to pursue their personal spiritual development. - Prevention (Preventir): The naturopathic physician emphasizes the prevention of disease by assessing risk factors, heredity and susceptibility to disease, and by making appropriate interventions in partnership with the patient to prevent illness. Common Myths About Naturopathic Medicine Now maybe a few of your uncertainties about naturopathic medicine are gone. But if you're anything like me, you might still have some questions. I had a lot of misconceptions before I became an ND. Let me clear some things up. To give you a well-rounded idea, let's talk about what it's not: - MYTH #1: Naturopathic medicine equals homeopathy. False! Homeopathy is one of the many tools in our toolbox we use for healing. Many naturopaths who graduate go on to never touch homeopathy again! - MYTH #2: Naturopathic medicine is anti-conventional medicine. Double-false! In fact, we're trained in many conventional diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. We're taught how to respect our colleagues in various specialties \u2014 to recognize the pieces of the puzzle they can help resolve. When my patients need antibiotics, diagnostic imaging, or surgery I refer them out without hesitation. My objective as a naturopathic doctor is to help people feel their best without causing harm. - MYTH #3: Naturopathic medicine is only for hippies. False, again! Naturopathic patients come from all walks of life the same way conventional patients do. A patient seeking a naturopathic doctor values prevention and wants to be an active participant in managing their health. So how does this relate to you and your family?
