The King of Mushrooms The King of Herbs The Health Modulator It is one of the mushroom categories that give the highest therapeutic effect to human bodies. In nature [Reishi](https://dxnproducts.com/ganoderma/) grows in densely wooded mountains of high humidity and dim lighting. It is a very scarce and hard to find plant. Its scientific name is Ganoderma Lucidum. Its Chinese name is Lingzhi. Its Japanese name is Reishi. This blog of mine is mainly the transcription of DXN Ganotherapeut's presentation, who is my upline sponsor as well.: The history of Ganoderma For more than 2000 years Lingzhi mushroom has been considered so auspicious that it's medicinal efficacy has been attested to the oldest Chinese medical text. The Food of Emperors Reishi was only reserved for emperors and royalties of China for centuries to promote longevity. Ganoderma has been categorized as King of Herbs and named as the Mushroom of Immortality. Lingzhi is documented in the oldest Chinese pharmacopoeia (Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing - Divine Farmer's Classic of Materia Medica) for having the most extensive and effective healing powers. Hierarchy of herbs in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM): Superior: Helps to recover from sickness and promotes balance in body systems. It can be consumed in the long run without side effects. Average: Promotes balance but does not help cure, so it is considered as \"tonic\". Can only be consumed periodically. Fair: Helps to remove symptoms but does not necessarily promote balance in the body systems. Can only be consumed when needed. There may be side effects. Ganoderma lucidum is a superior herb with no toxic effects. Ganoderma goes into the spotlight It achieved its ranking in Chinese writings not because of its symbolic importance as a good omen, but because of its medicinal properties with no side effects. It is 100% safe to use. Today many of its bioactive compounds are classified and uncovered. The modern scientists who have taken interest in this ancient remedy came from Japan, China, Taiwan, Korea, Malaysia, India, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam. Then it slowly attracted the attention of the Western countries like New Zealand, Canada and the United States. Ganoderma cultivation 1970: China and Japan successfully planted Ganoderma in laboratory using spore separation cultivation method. 1975: Commercial production in Japan. 1980: Commercial production in Taiwan. 1983: Commercial production in is DXN Ganoderma? ( What is Reishi Gano? How to reassure the quality of DXN RG? - The right species - The age of the plant - The process of extraction - The concentration Let's have a look at this points in details. - The right species Malaysia has more than 400 varieties of edible Ganoderma. After many years of research by DXN CEO Dato' Dr. Lim Siow Jin, 6 varieties of Red Mushrooms were being selected since they give the best therapeutic effects. DXN Ganoderma is a combination of 6 types of Red Mushrooms: Liver Gano, Kimshen Gano, Ruyi Gano, Brain Gano, and Heart Gano. - The age of Ganoderma In ancient Traditional Chinese Medicine context the older Ganoderma gives a better medicinal effect. However most of the nutrients are being stored in the mushroom spores. When the Ganoderma gets too old, there will not be any spores left. DXN RG Is derived from the 3-month-old mushroom spores. If the age of Reishi is either too young or too old it will lose its medicinal efficacy. Due to the humid climate in Malaysia the concentration of the spores in the mushroom is high. It can be easily harvested within 3 months. Ganoderma mushrooms in DXN Malaysia factories are grown using sawdust and rice husk. The sawdust and the rice husks are being placed into biodegradable polybags. The medium will be sterilized in an autoclave machine to kill other fungus within. Insect nets are used to keep the insects away from the growing medicinal mushrooms. Spring water is sprayed to maintain the humidity and moisture in the Ganoderma farm. - Process of extraction In Traditional Chinese Medicine Lingzhi was sliced and boiled for a long time to obtain the extract. However most of the nutrients were being destroyed during the heating process. DXN extracts the fruit body by means of Cold Method, preserving the therapeutic effects of the medicinal mushroom. The micro-powderation technology enhances the bioavailability so the nutrients absorb into the body more easily. - The concentration From 20 kg of fruit body 4 kg of dried mushroom is produced. 4 kg of dried, processed Lingzhi gives 1kg of RG. Hence the total ratio of the fruit body and [active substance](https://dxnproducts.com/ganoderma-extracts-from-dxn-for-detoxifying-and-rebuilding-the-body/) of RG is 20:1. The concentration is very crucial to determine the therapeutic effects of the Ganoderma. DXN Ganoderma [powders and capsules](https://dxnproducts.com/dxn-reishi-gano-and-dxn-ganocelium-medicinal-mushroom-extract-experiences/) contain only the active substance of the medicinal mushroom! The Cold Method, step-by-step 1. Dehydration: Freeze drying method to lock in all the nutrients and health benefits of Ganoderma. (5 kilos = 1 kilo when dried) 2. Fiber separation: Removing the less therapeutic fiber from dried Reishi using a high-technology process developed by DXN. (4 kilos = 1 kilo) 3. Ultraviolet ray treatment: Part of the process used to disinfect while preserving therapeutic effects found in Ganoderma. 4. Micro-powderation: Crushing the hard covering of Ganoderma spores and reducing them to micro size. All nutrients are preserved throughout the entire process. The total concentration is 20 to 1. This also means 100% pure active substance of the medicinal mushroom. Freeze drying: Freeze drying method retains 97% of nutrition of the medicinal mushroom. It is remarkable because it causes no damage to the nutrition of the food being preserved. Nutritional value of foods retained with different kind of methods: Freeze dried 97% Dehydrated 60% Canned 40% Bioactive nutrients in DXN Reishi Gano Researchers discovered more than 400 bioactive ingredients in Ganoderma lucidum that have therapeutic effects on human health. Polysaccharides boost and modulate immunity. Adenosin in improves blood circulation. Triterpenes increase stress resistance. Organic germanium improves cellular oxygenation. Ganoderic acids are cardioprotective and liver protective. They enhance energy level. The valuable benefits of DXN RG - Reduces the stickiness of the blood. - Dissolves the blockages of blood vessels including minute blood vessels. - Reduces inflammation in blood vessels. - Remove fat and water soluble toxins. - Enhances the production of antioxidant from the liver. - Enhances the immune system. - Stabilizes emotions and reduces stress by increasing stress resistance. - Prevents tissues and cell generations - Balances systemic functions and maintains body homeostasis. What is DXN Ganocelium (GL)? [DXN GL](https://dxnproducts.com/ganocelium-from-dxn-the-healer/) is derived the 14-day-old mushroom. The bioactive Germanium: The organic germanium content of GL is 4 times bigger than RG. It greatly improves cellular oxygenation. Beneficial enzymes: They improve digestion and healing ability. A wide spectrum of vitamins: Abundant with B group vitamins, vitamin D and vitamin C. A wide spectrum of minerals: Selenium, iron, calcium, zinc, magnesium, copper and potassium. The valuable benefits of DXN GL - Heightens cellular oxygenation level. - Enhances and modulates the immune system. - A good brain tonic. - Eliminates water soluble toxins. - Reduces and regulates blood sugar. Improve pancreatic functions. - The polysaccharide Glucan-D6 chain from Ganoderma mycelium is essential to rebuild bone marrow. - Good for stem cells production. Hence this will improve body healing ability. - Repairs, recovers and strengthens cell membrane integrity: if the integrity of the membrane is lost, certain things that should not enter get in, and certain things that should not leave leak out. - Normalizes is body functions. - Anti-cancer activity. - The wide spectrum of enzymes in GL enhances gastrointestinal functions. When DXN RG and GL come together GL helps to strengthen the cell membrane and prevent toxins re-entering the cell. RG helps to remove toxins from the cell. How to take DXN RG and GL?
