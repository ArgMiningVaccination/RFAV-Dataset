Updated: 6 days ago The two most important aspects to consider when utilizing zeolite for detox are quality and quantity. Here we'll see why getting the right dose of zeolite is essential for a proper detox, and that all of the general supplement dosing rules don't apply with zeolite supplements. The Traditional Approach The traditional approach, which I highly recommend with most supplements, is to start with a very low dose and work your way up. Starting with a high dose of certain supplements could cause an adverse reaction or result in an unwanted detox reaction. This is especially important to consider with more sensitive individuals who often have strong reactions, both positive and negative when introducing new supplements. Someone on the Lyme/mold/MCAS spectrum is a prime example of this type of individual. The Zeolite Approach The traditional start low and slow approach to supplements does not apply with zeolite and in fact can be dangerous. The lower the dose, the more likely a detox reaction and redistribution of toxins will occur. In fact, although it seems counter-intuitive, if you experience a detox reaction from taking zeolite you should take a higher dose immediately. The higher the dose, the less likely you are to experience a detox reaction and redistribution of toxins. This is why liquid zeolite products often cause detox reactions while high-dose zeolite powders usually do not. Many people are tricked into thinking that their liquid zeolite supplement is working because they are experiencing a detox reaction. Yes, it is working to some extent but the fact that you are experiencing a reaction means you need a way higher dose. Utilizing a high-quality zeolite powder can expedite your results and reduce or eliminate the detox reaction, even in sensitive individuals. The Dosing Explanation As far as I can tell there are three main reasons that a higher dose of zeolite is safer and more effective than a lower dose. Reason One- Level of affinity. Zeolite has a strong negative charge and thus is attracted to positively charged molecules. Since most toxins, such as heavy metals, radiation, and pesticides, are positively charged, zeolite is pulled to the toxins, like a magnet, and sucks them up into its structure. This makes zeolite an effective detox method for a number of toxic elements. But the key here is that zeolite is more attracted to certain toxic elements than others. For example, zeolite has a higher affinity for lead than for mercury. So let's say the zeolite enters your bloodstream and binds to mercury. Then it continues through the blood stream and finds some lead. The zeolite will drop the mercury and bind to the lead because it is more attracted to the lead. If a high dose of zeolite was consumed then there is probably enough extra zeolite in the blood to pick up the dropped mercury. If a low dose was taken the mercury may be redistrubed and result in a detox reaction. Note- this is one reason that staying on zeolite for an extended period of time may be important. It may take months before the zeolite really starts effectively detoxing mercury depending on how many other toxins are in your body that are the priority for zeolite. Reason Two- Zeolite in the gut. Particle size is critical. Many zeolite products boast a small particle size but lack the ability to catch toxins in the gut. Instead of offering one particle size, our zeolite range from 0 to 40 microns with 80% of the micron particles being less than 10 microns and the other 20% being from 10-40 microns. This range in microns insures a more complete full-body detox. Smaller zeolite particles are carried into the bloodstream for cellular detox, while the larger particles stay in the digestive tract to act as a binder. This offers a more balanced detox and reduces die off reactions common with many zeolite supplements. So the higher the dose of zeolite, the more large zeolite particles are left in the gut to act as a binder. Reason Three- Many toxic elements cluster together in the body in biofilms. Once these biofilms are disrupted all of the toxic elements within will disperse and start looking for a new home. Zeolite has a strong ability to break open biofilms. Let's suppose that zeolite encounters a biofilm and attaches itself to lead that is a component of the biofilm. The zeolite will pull the lead out and the biofilm will be disrupted. Only a low dose of zeolite is needed to break apart biofilms, but a higher dose will be needed to sop up all of the toxic elements that are in the biofilm. If too low of a dose is taken some of the toxic elements will likely find a new home in your body, and this redistribution can cause detox symptoms. Real World Example Let's consider the dosing dilemma of Susanna (fake name used to protect identity). Susanna has been battling chronic Lyme, mold illness, EMF sensitivity, heavy metal toxicity etc. for many years. She has tried almost everything in her search for a health solution that works. The challenge has been that she is so toxic she hasn't been able to stay on any detox protocol or supplement regimen. She can't even utilize wellness technology like PEMF mats without experiencing a severe detox reaction. Susanna ordered ZeoBoost in hopes that this was the answer that she has been looking for. She was skeptical of the recommendation of taking 6 teaspoons per day (15 grams). She decided to start with 1/8 of a teaspoon to see how she would feel...She ended up bed ridden for 3 days. Terrible weakness and neurological symptoms are a couple of the debilitating symptoms that resulted from this low dose. After receiving a call from Susanna informing me that the ZeoBoost did not work but made her worse I asked how much she took. After learning of the 1/8 teaspoon dose I encouraged her to immediately take a multiple teaspoon dose. She was weary of the idea but decided to give it a try based on my explanation. She called me back 60 minutes later in unbelief...She felt incredible! She joyfully explained that her fatigue and brain fog started lifting within 10 minutes of the higher dose. Susanna began experimenting with various doses and confirmed that low doses made her feel terrible, while high doses made her feel better than she has felt in years. The higher the dose the better! Susanna is now taking 6-12 teaspoons per day and loving every spoonful of ZeoBoost! Zeolite Dosing I recommend starting with 15 grams of powdered zeolite per day, taken all in one dose. If you experience a detox reaction raise your dose. I recommend staying on this dose for at lest 90 days and then considering lowering the dose to 5 grams, taken once per day for maintenance. Important Note Everything I have mentioned in this article is based off of my experience and research with ZeoBoost . I cannot speak to the quality of other zeolite products on the market and these principles may not apply. Choosing a Quality Zeolite Supplement It's important to choose a quality, effective zeolite product and also to take it at the necessary dose. Utilizing a poor quality zeolite or taking the wrong dose can result in negative outcomes. Poor quality or liquid zeolite supplements lack the dose, combination of large and small particle size and binding capacity needed for an effective detox. ZeoBoost is a high-quality, powdered zeolite supplement offered at a fraction of the cost of many zeolite products on the market. Order from the link below!
