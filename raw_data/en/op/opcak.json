Background The development of vaccines was a pivotal public health bre akthrough and has played an important role in reducing or eliminating instances of deadly disease. Smallpox is one such example; between 1900 -1980 approximately 300 million people died from smallpox.1 Today, smallpox is the only human disease to have been eradicated by vaccination.2 Polio is another example. Cases due to wild poliovirus have decreased by over 99 percent since 1988, when there were approximately 350,000 new cases, to just 33 reported cases in 2018.3 Influenza is another infectious disease f or which vaccines are an important public health intervention. On average, eight percent of the U.S. population gets sick from flu each season .4 In the 2017 -2018 influenza season, the C enters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recorded an estimated 48.8 million illnesses and 79, 400 deaths .5 During th at season, CDC estimated that flu vaccination coverage among adults was 37.1 percent .6 Influenza also has a significant economic impact. The estimated average annual economic burden of influenza, which includes 1 Azimi, Tara et al.

This pandemic is estimated to have caused at least 50 million deaths worldwide with approximately 675,000 of those in the United States.8 Vaccination Rates and Benefits The current influenza vaccine is designed to be administered annu ally as every flu season there are different influenza viruses circulating, and an updated annual vaccine provides the best protection against the viruses. Most influenza vaccines in the United States for this season are designed to protect against four di fferent influenza viruses: two influenza A viruses (H1N1 and H3N2) and two influenza B viruses. There are also influenza vaccines that protect against three of the four influenza viruses . Two of these vaccines are designed for use in people aged 65 and older to elicit a stronger immune response.9 The CDC currently recommends that everyone 6 months or older receive a flu vaccine except in rare cases.10 The CDC also identifies populations that are at increased risk of developing serious complications from an influenza infection including: adults aged 65 or older, pregnant women, people with heart disease, people with asthma, and young children.11 Influenza vaccination rates in the United States vary year -to-year and are tracked by the CDC. Children are mor e likely to be vaccinated than adults. For the 2018 -2019 influenza season, CDC estimated the vaccination coverage in adults 18 or older at 45.3% and coverage in children aged 6 months to 17 years at 62.6%. The vaccination coverage also varied by state rang ing from 33.9% to 56.3% in adults and 46.0% to 81.1% in children.12 While the vaccine does not always prevent illness, it is still beneficial even i n people who do get sick. The influenza vaccine can reduce the severity of the symptoms of an illness and help prevent hospitalizations due to influenza infection. The vaccine can also help protect people who work or live with someone infected with influenza.13 Given the potential for compli cations from influenza , especially in the at -risk populatio ns, reducing the severity of the illness saves lives. 7 Putri WCWS et al.

The virus strains are selected based on data on which viruses are circulating and predictions about which viruses are most likely to circulate in the upcoming season. The data is collected from more than 100 countries through the World Health Organization (WHO). The CDC houses one of t he five WHO centers for collecting the data. While the WHO recommends which viruses to include in the annual vaccine, each country makes the final decision on which viruses are included in their own vaccines.14 In the United States, the Food and Drug Admini stration (FDA) is responsible for the final decision on which influenza viruses will be included in the annual vaccine.15 The FDA has approved three production methods for the annual influenza vaccine: egg -based vaccines, cell -based vaccines and recombina nt vaccines.16 The most common production method for influenza vaccines in the United States remains the egg -based method, in which the selected virus strains are grown in chicken eggs. The entire process can take up to six months from the selection of the viruses and the initial laboratory work to the time needed to grow the viruses in eggs and produce the required number of doses each year in time for the start of the influenza season. The cell -based manufacturing process involves growing candidate vaccine viruses in cultured mammalian cells rather than eggs.17 The recombinant vaccine production method involves isolating a certain protein from a naturally occurring influenza virus, combining these proteins with portions of another virus that is then mixed wi th insect cells and allowed to grow. An influenza surface protein is then extracted from the insect cells and purified.18 The long lead time for vaccine production can lead to a mismatch between the viruses included in the vaccine and the viruses found to be circulating at the start of the flu season, resulting in reduced vaccine effectiveness. The CDC estimates that the vaccine effectiveness for the 2017 - 2018 influenza season at 38 percent while preliminary estimates for the 2018 -2019 influenza season est imate the vaccine effectiveness at 47 percent.19 The time lag can be disastrous if there is a pandemic. Replacing the egg -based production method, which currently dominates the market, with a more effective and significantly shorter lead time method is a major challenge in current flu vaccine development. For a while, there was hype around the cell -based methods , and they are much faster than the egg -based . However, they have not been demonstrated to be more effective than the egg -based, and the initial capit al costs to build new production plants is very high. Another scientific challenge is accurately diagnosing an illness as being caused by 14 CDC. Selecting Viruses for the Seasonal Influenza Vaccine .

Many winter illnesses with flu -like symptoms may not be cau sed by influenza. Accurately diagnosing which influenza virus is causing an illness will provide more data for scientists to use when deciding which influenza viruses to include in the annual vaccine. Universal Influenza Vaccine Work is underway in both federal agencies and the private sector to develop a universal influenza vaccine. The National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) states that a universal influenza vaccine should: be at least 75 percent effective, protect against group I and II Influenza A viruses, have protection that lasts at least one year, and be suitable for all age groups.20 NIAID released its strategic plan for developing a universal influenza vaccine in February 2018. This plan identified three main research areas f or NIAID: improve understanding of transmission, natural history, and pathogenesis of influenza virus infection; precisely characterize influenza immunity and correlates of immune protection, and; support rational design of universal influenza vaccines.21 Cross -Cutting Vaccine Science and Innovation Challenges There are a number of challenges to developing and producing any new vaccine. Some of these challenges involve the financial and time costs of developing a new vaccine. The average new vaccine takes over ten years to develop and only has a six percent chance of making it to the market.22 A potential new vaccine may have an uncertain return on investment, especially if the vaccine is not intended for a large percentage of the population or if there are alternatives to the vaccine. This uncertainty can disincentivize work to develop a new vaccine. In addition to the financial challenges of developing new vaccines, there are a number of scientific challenges. Some of these scientific challenges are in fu ndamental human biology, specifically improving our understanding of the human immune system and human immune response, as well as the mechanisms by which vaccines act.23 Some of the scientific challenges also stem from the nature of the infectious disease in question. The challenge of the influenza virus constantly changing has already been discussed. Malaria, a disease for which there is currently no licensed vaccine, is another infectious disease for which there are a number of scientific challenges to de veloping a vaccine. The parasite that causes malaria is complex and there is not good understanding of the human immune response to infection . This complexity also means there are a large number of potential antigens that might be used in a vaccine. Finall y, infection with malaria parasites only results in partial future immunity, further increasing 20 NIAID. Universal Influenza Vaccine Research .

Role of Data Science in Vaccine Development Data science and data collection are integral to develop ing an effective vaccine and the annual influenza vaccine is an important example of this. As noted earlier, the WHO uses data collected from over 100 countries when making recommendations for which influenza viruses should be included in the annual vaccine. However, data standards and reporting formats may be different , and as noted previously, the data itself can contain incomplete information about which influenza viruses (if any) caused someone's illness . In addition, many of the data systems being used ar e outdated, including in the U.S. There is a significant effort underway to fund the modernization of data systems at the CDC, as well as action at the state level to modernize state data systems , led in part by the Council of State and Territorial Epide miologists . Increases in the effectiveness of data collection, sharing, interconnectivity, and analysis will give scientists better surveillance data to inform vaccine development, especially in the case of the flu since it requires an annual vaccine . Further, advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence systems could benefit data analysis relating to infectious disease due to the strengths of these systems in pattern recognition and classification . Social Science Research and Applications Communication with the public about vaccines is another factor in vaccine effectiveness. This includes m aking people aware of the benefits of vaccines as well as communicating the dangers posed by infectious diseases . Campaigns aimed at increasing the rate of influenza vaccination occur at national, state and local levels, including the CDC's National Influenza Prevention and Vaccination Campaign.25 Social science research may offer more insight into why people make certain vaccination c hoices and into effect ive messages for increasing rates of vaccination , including how to most effectively communicate across different subsets of the population. Role of Federal Agencies There are a number of federal agencies that are involved in the development and production of vaccines in the United States. These agencies include the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which conducts basic , applied and translational research on vaccines. NIH also conducts clinical evaluation to identify vaccine targets and advance vaccine candidate . The FDA is responsible for vaccine review and licensing, regulatory science and innovation, international collaboration, and post-licensure manufacturing and safety monitoring. The work conducted by CDC during the process includes disea se surveillance, setting immunization schedules, the national immunization 24 CDC. Vaccines .

The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is responsible for developing and obtaining needed medical countermeasures, including vaccines. BARDA helps support late -stage development of new products and supports advanced R&D alongside a number of other federal agencies. Much of BARDA's work is accomplished through public - private partnerships. The National Vaccine Program Office (NVPO) is responsible for strategic leadership and coordination and coordinating the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC).26 26 Encouraging Vaccine Innovation: Promoting the Development of Vaccines tha t Minimize the Burden of Infectious Disease in the 21st Century December 2017. https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/encouraging_vaccine_innovati on_2018_final_report.pdf .
