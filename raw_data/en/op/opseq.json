Question: Assign R or S configuration to each chirality center in pseudoephedrine, an over-the-counter decongestant found in cold remedies (blue = N). R/S Nomenclature: R/S nomenclature involves several rules to find the stereochemistry of a compound. The substituents attached to the chiral centers are assigned priorities in which the clockwise direction depicts the R stereoisomer, and the anticlockwise direction depicts the S stereoisomer.
