There was a time, when the world's most devastating diseases occurred because of infections by various pathogens. As modern sciences progressed, man conquered most of these diseases through antibiotics, vaccinations, inoculations leading to complete eradication of some. However, a new set of equally lethal diseases (ironically a by-product of our affluent lifestyle) are now threatening us. Most of the diseases are \"silent\". You often do not have early symptoms. Hence regular screening tests are the only way for early detection.

The tests determine how much air your lungs can hold, how quickly you can move air in and out of your lungs, and how well your lungs put oxygen into and remove carbon dioxide from your blood. The tests can diagnose lung diseases, measure the severity of lung problems, and check to see how well treatment for a lung disease is working. These tests are excellent for smokers, asthmatics, people who work in dusty environments, etc. They are used to diagnose and treat the conditions and will assist in the optimal drug therapy needed to ensure best health. Other tests, such as exercise stress tests, may also be done at the same time to determine cardiac function and your response to physical exertion. The lung function may need to be repeated. Spirometry is the first and most commonly done lung function test. It measures how much and how quickly you can move air out of your lungs. For this test, you breathe into a mouthpiece attached to a recording device (spirometer). The information collected by the spirometer may be printed out on a chart called a spirogram.

As your body works harder during the test, it requires more oxygen, so the heart must pump more blood. The test can show if the blood supply is reduced in the arteries that supply the heart. It also helps doctors know the kind and level of exercise appropriate for a patient. A person taking the test: - Is hooked up to the equipment to monitor the heart. - Walks slowly in place on a treadmill. Then the speed is increased for a faster pace and the treadmill is tilted to produce the effect of going up a small hill. - May be asked to breathe into a tube for a couple of minutes. - Can stop the test at any time if needed. - Afterwards will sit or lie down to have their heart and blood pressure checked. - Heart rate, breathing, blood pressure, electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), and how tired you feel are monitored during the test. Healthy people who take the test are at very little risk. It's about the same as if they walk fast or jog up a big hill. Medical professionals should be present in case something unusual happens during the test. A physician may recommend an exercise stress test to: - Diagnose coronary artery disease - Diagnose a possible heart-related cause of symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath or lightheadedness - Determine a safe level of exercise - Check the effectiveness of procedures done to improve coronary artery circulation in patients with coronary artery disease - Predict risk of dangerous heart-related conditions such as a heart attack. Depending on the results of the exercise stress test, the physician may recommend more tests such as a nuclear stress test or cardiac catheterization.

A 2-D (or two-dimensional) echo-cardiogram is capable of displaying a cross-sectional \"slice\" of the beating heart, including the chambers, valves and the major blood vessels that exit from the left and right ventricle. A Doppler echo-cardiogram measures the speed and direction of the blood flow within the heart. It screens the four valves for leaks and other abnormalities. By assigning color to the direction of blood flow, (Color Flow Mapping), large areas of blood flow may be studied. These color flow mappings allow abnormal blood flow characteristics to be interpreted by the cardiologist.

Treatment varies for each individual, not simply on the type of diabetes that they have, but also more individual-specific diabetic treatment differences. The aim of diabetes treatment is to keep, within reason, blood glucose levels as near to normal as possible. Training in self-management of diabetes forms an essential part of diabetes management. Treatment should be agreed on an individual basis and address medical, psychosocial and lifestyle issues. Balanced diabetes treatments: A variety of different factors have a role to play in treating diabetes, but the importance of balanced, coordinated diabetes treatment for all diabetics cannot be underestimated. Regular and successful treatment decreases the risk of each patient developing diabetes complications. The basics of diabetes treatment are broken down into each diabetic type below. Treatment: Type 1 Diabetes: Type 1 diabetes treatment is a daily task. Lack of insulin production by the pancreas makes Type 1 diabetes is particularly difficult to control. Treatment requires a strict regimen that typically includes a carefully calculated diet, planned physical activity, multiple daily insulin injections and home blood glucose testing a number of times per day. Type 2 Diabetes: Diabetes Mellitus Type 2, also known as type 2 diabetes, is a globally common metabolic disorder affecting over 2 million people in the UK alone. Once called adult-onset diabetes (and also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus - NIDDM), type 2 diabetes is now also found in young adults and children.

View Complete Details [Ear Nose Throat](//www.indiamart.com/proddetail/ear-nose-throat-6341047230.html) Get Latest Price Many ear, nose and throat disorders can cause or contribute to headache. This can be due to 'referred pain', which is when pain in one area of the body is transferred to another area nearby. The main sensory nerve to the sinuses, nose and face (the trigeminal nerve) also has connections with the nerves of the head and upper neck. If problems such as a sinus infection trigger pain in one of the branches of the trigeminal nerve, the sensation can travel along these connections and cause a headache. The treatment for headache triggered by ear, nose and throat problems varies according to the cause. One of the most common triggers is sinus congestion. Sinuses problems can cause headaches: The sinuses are the air-filled cavities inside the skull that make up part of the respiratory system. The main sensory nerve to the sinuses, nose and face (the trigeminal nerve) also has connections with the nerves of the head and upper neck. This is why a sinus infection can commonly result in face pain and headache. Causes of sinus congestion include the cold, flu, hay fever or other allergic reaction, and sinusitis (infection of the sinuses). Ear problems can cause headaches: The ear is made up of three parts, being the outer, middle and inner ear. Problems can affect any one of these parts and bring on an associated headache. Nose problems can cause headaches: There are various disorders of the nose that can cause or contribute to headache. Some of the more common include: Hay fever (allergic rhinitis) - the immune system overreacts to such irritants as pollen or animal dander, causing symptoms including nasal congestion, watering and itchy eyes, and headache. Treatment includes avoidance of known triggers and drugs such as antihistamines. Hormonal rhinitis - some women experience nasal congestion and stuffiness during pregnancy. This is caused by hormones. The only real cure for hormonal rhinitis is delivery. Inflammatory rhino sinusitis - this inflammation of the nose and sinuses is caused by a number of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Treatment involves treating the underlying disorder. Non-allergic rhinitis - is similar to allergic rhinitis, but has no identifiable trigger to the reaction. Treatment includes antihistamines. Throat problems can cause headaches: The tonsils sit at the back of the throat and form part of the body's immune system. They can become infected by viruses or bacteria. Sometimes complications of tonsillitis, dental infection or tumours can cause throat pain and associated headache, etc. View Complete Details [Dermatology Skin Care](//www.indiamart.com/proddetail/dermatology-skin-care-6340803391.html) Get Latest Price Our priority is your best interest.

However, vaccination is an important step in protecting your child against a range of serious and potentially fatal diseases. Vaccinations are quick, safe and extremely effective. Once your child has been vaccinated against a disease, their body can fight that disease more effectively if they come into contact with it. If a child isn't vaccinated, they will be at increased risk of catching the illness. - There will always be some children who are unavoidably unprotected because: - They can't be vaccinated for medical reasons - They're too young to be vaccinated - They can't get to the vaccine services - For a few, the vaccine doesn't work But if more parents have their children vaccinated, then more children in the community will be protected against catching an illness. This lowers the chance of an outbreak of the disease. The only time that it's safe to stop vaccinating children against an illness is when the disease has been wiped out worldwide.

EEG is a tool we use to image the brain while it is performing a cognitive task. This allows us to detect the location and magnitude of brain activity involved in the various types of cognitive functions we study. EEG allows us to view and record the changes in your brain activity during the time you are performing the task. Brain is constantly producing tiny electrical signals. During an EEG test, electrodes (flat metal discs) are placed on your head. The electrodes pick up the electrical signals from your brain and record them on an EEG machine. The electrodes only pick up electrical signals from your brain. They do not affect your brain and they do not cause you any pain. The EEG machine records the electrical signals from your brain on a computer. They look like wavy lines and these represent your brainwave patterns. The EEG test can only show your brainwave patterns at the time the test is carried out. At different times, your brainwave patterns may be different. Most people have brainwave patterns that look similar to everyone else's. Sometimes, the EEG test shows that a person has different brainwave patterns to other people. These are caused by unusual electrical activity in their brain. They can sometimes indicate that the person has epilepsy.
