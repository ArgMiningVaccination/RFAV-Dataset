While recent empirical studies show positive impacts for some outcomes, little is known about program mechanisms and the potential to reduce inequality across groups. Using an embedded randomized control trial, this study evaluates improvements in short-term outcomes for the Boston SYEP based on survey data collected for both treatment and control groups during the summers of 2015, 2016, and 2017. Participants reported increases in community engagement and social skills, job readiness skills, and college aspirations that were significantly different from the control group. In most cases, the largest gains were observed for non-white youth suggesting that the program may have the capacity to reduce inequality across groups. Our hope is that this article will serve as a resource for those seeking to understand how summer jobs programs work and for whom, and to use these findings to strengthen and target the SYEP intervention. We also provide practical lessons learned regarding the development and deployment of our survey instrument to both the treatment and control groups among the youth population.

It offers the first extensive, critical examination and synthesis of this subset of work including its theoretical foundations, key technical features, and applications for evaluation research. The paper begins by more formally defining the micro-geographic concept and examining the theoretical framework of micro-geographic policies. It then conducts an extensive review of the empirical micro-geographic evaluation literature with a focus on the findings and methodologies. The paper identifies three dominant methodological components (differencing estimates, clear counterfactual selection strategies, and clear methods for the treatment of geography) and proposes a more formalized micro-geographic evaluation framework. It concludes with a discussion of key lessons and new avenues of research.

Due to this lack of evidence, there is no efficient way to suggest which programs are most effective in helping Veterans in need of support. One potential solution to this dilemma is to reconceptualize program evaluation, by moving away from evaluating programs individually to evaluating what is common across programs. The Common Components Analysis (CCA) is one such technique that aggregates findings from programs that have undergone rigorous evaluation at the level of program components (e.g., content, process, barrier reduction). Given that many Veteran programs lack outcome evidence from rigorous studies, an adaptation to CCA is needed. This report examines cross-sectional data from a pilot study using an adapted CCA across five domains of well-being (i.e., employment, education, legal/financial/housing, mental/physical health, and social/personal relationships). The purpose of this preliminary study is to determine the feasibility of eliciting program nominations and program components from Veterans via an online survey. When coupled with a longitudinal research design, this adaptation to CCA will allow for stronger causal claims about the expected impact of different program components within and across a variety of domains.

Composite indices are built to perform spatial and temporal benchmarking relying on the P2 Distance method. The results are contrasted with other indices developed under a multi-criterion approach with a double reference point. The main findings are that all the countries have improved their situation and country disparities have been reduced. Cambodia and Ethiopia have registered the best trends and South Sudan and Timor-Leste show the worse performance. Considering the position in the 2015 ranking, Rwanda and Bhutan performed the best, while Somalia and Chad rank in the last position. Having now reached the end of the Millennium Development Goals period, the gap with respect to the world average indicates that much work remains to be done in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Typically, outcome evaluation is conducted for a single program from a single perspective. However, in a real-life situation, many programs exist in a system, and the effects could be viewed from various perspectives. The authors illustrate a typology of program effects in a system. It moves from the paradigm of a single program's single effect to that of a set of programs' multiple effects. Methodological implications are discussed.

Since 2012, the Mental Health Commission of Canada has worked with six First Nations communities to develop a culturally-relevant version of the program called Mental Health First Aid First Nations (MHFAFN). This paper presents mixed methods, multi-informant data from a national evaluation to assess the extent to which the course was experienced as culturally safe by Indigenous participants, factors that contributed to these experiences, and ways in which cultural relevancy of MHFAFN can be improved. Our evaluation team conducted participant interviews and surveys, as well as facilitator interviews. Nearly all Indigenous participants (94.6%) experienced the course as safe. Participants and facilitators identified a range of factors that promoted cultural safety, including the knowledge and skills of the facilitators and the cultural components of the course. Participants that did not experience safety identified trauma-related factors and facilitation style. The findings suggest that MHFAFN may be situated in a way where shared cultural backgrounds are imperative to the success of the course. Further evaluation of the MHFAFN curriculum, with the goal of continual improvement, may help to further enhance participants' experiences in taking the course.

The purpose of this article is to report lessons learned and share best practices from the implementation and evaluation of a high school STEM program that aims to provide an authentic research experience for African-American students and expose them to the possibility and benefits of attaining advanced degrees and careers in STEM fields. Participants reported that enriching science experiences improved their college readiness and exposed them to STEM degree and career options. Formative evaluation results lead to the following lessons learned for best practice: 1) Relationships with high schools will facilitate buy-in; 2) Setting clear expectations and assigning responsibilities is essential; 3) Diversity and cultural sensitivity training is necessary; and 4) Programs of this nature need strong evaluation.

Extending theory to investigate community capacity to participate in Ghana's community-based health planning and service implementation While primary health care programmes based on community participation are widely implemented in low- and middle- income settings, empirical evidence on whether and to what extent local people have the capacity to participate, support and drive such programmes scale up is scant in these countries. This paper assessed the level of community capacity to participate in one such programme - the Community-Based Health Planning and Service (CHPS) in Ghana. The capacity assessments were drawn from Chaskin's (2001) theorised indicators of community capacity with modifications to include: sense of community; community members commitment; community leadership commitment; problem solving mechanisms; and access to resources. These capacity measures guided the design of an interview guide used to collect data from community informants, frontline health providers (FLP) and district health managers. Key qualitative themes were built into a questionnaire administered to households selected through systematic sampling approach. Findings showed that growing individualism, low trust in neighbours and apathetic behaviours undermined the capacity of mutual support for CHPS. The capacity to support CHPS was high for local leadership and community social mobilisation groups who often dedicated time to working with FLP to promote maternal and reproductive health service use, and in advocating broader support for CHPS. Within the wider community, commitment to voluntarism was low as members perceived CHPS to be owned by, and run on government funds and resources. Poor voluntarism was compounded by poverty that crippled the capacity to provide needed resource support for CHPS. Findings have great implications for building strong capable communities for participation in community oriented health programmes.

The current study aimed to conduct a participatory, formative evaluation of \"Working on Womanhood\" (WOW), a community-developed, multifaceted, school-based intervention serving primarily ethnic minority girls living in underserved urban communities. Specifically, the current study aimed to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and initial promise of WOW using community-based participatory research (CBPR) and represented the third phase of a community-academic partnership. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from 960 WOW participants in 21 urban public schools, as well as WOW counselors, parents, and school staff over the course of one academic year. Results demonstrated evidence of acceptability of WOW and noteworthy improvements for WOW participants in targeted outcomes, including mental health, emotion regulation, and academic engagement. Findings also indicated several challenges to implementation feasibility and acceptability, including screening and enrollment processes and curriculum length. Additionally, we discuss how, consistent with participatory and formative research, findings were used by program implementers to inform program improvements, including modifications to screening processes, timelines, curriculum, and trainings - all in preparation for a rigorous effectiveness evaluation.

The result is that an increasing number of countries have tackled the task of shifting preexisting political institutions to confirm with these new understandings. This is, of course, no easy feat. A great number of challenges confront willing policymakers, a reality that often puts philosophy at loggerheads with practicality. Moreover, the political process of change is subject to the influence of cultural and institutional norms. In this paper, we look at one particular case study - that of Malaysia's juvenile justice system - to understand the challenges faced in changing criminal justice policy. We identify three primary categories of challenges and elucidate their shape and impact through the Malaysian example. We also briefly analyze potential opportunities to mitigate and overcome these challenges. Furthermore, we also conclude with several implications for future research that we deem are important to be taken place. In sum, we argue that criminal justice reform must be undertaken with an eye toward important societal and institutional norms, each requiring thoughtful analysis of complex local cases.

Begun in 2012, MITS now operates in five elementary schools in Toledo Public Schools. A quasi-experimental study of 379 students (n = 128 mentored, n = 251 comparison) tested the effectiveness of MITS, using changes (fall to spring) in students' scores on STAR Reading. Multilevel models demonstrate students who participated in MITS made statistically significant, and educationally meaningful, reading gains compared to students who did not participate. Further, an investigation of the importance of dosage revealed that number of mentoring sessions is related to students' outcomes; students who participated in reading mentoring at least once per week showed the most educationally meaningful improvements. We also report qualitative feedback from adult program participants, including teachers, mentors, and site coordinators, to help contextualize the STAR Reading results. These findings speak to the opportunity for community volunteers to act as low-cost and effective supports for urban elementary school students who are at-risk for reading Kristina N.

The tool's purpose was to support program planning and evaluation by our resource support team within a paediatric health care setting. Our aims in developing it were to 1) establish a streamlined process and supporting tools to efficiently plan and prioritize program directions and activities; 2) track progress; and 3) evaluate and report on our performance, outputs and outcomes. A collaborative approach based on the ADKAR (Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, Reinforcement) change management model and the LEADS (Lead self, Engage others, Achieve results, Develop coalitions, Systems transformation) leadership framework was used to guide the design and implementation processes. Team members reported high perceived effectiveness and efficiency with respect to the tool's utility in supporting its proposed aims. A graded approach to building knowledge and skills in using the tool, to individual responsibility for data entry, and to accountability by team members facilitated its successful implementation. Administrative support is important for sustainability and continual improvement of the tool to address changing team needs over time.

Many underprivileged Bangladeshi children are vulnerable to child trafficking, abuse, and exploitation. Child-Friendly Space (CFS) is a semi-permanent house space where vulnerable children are given the support to have a safe environment to survive and thrive. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of CFS in providing a protective environment for the children in Bangladesh. A set of secondary and primary data was used to review child protection situation in Bangladesh, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the CFS within a community. An evaluation of child development among the children who attend in the CFS and who do not attend in the CFS was conducted. CFS was found to benefit vulnerable children and communities in terms of protective environment and child development. Children attending in the CFS had better performance at almost every child development indicator. At the community level, child labor decreased in the areas where CFS exists. To respond to the continuing threats of child insecurity, this study presents a set of recommendations for the sustainability of the CFS in the community.

EAs are assessments that minimize the uncertainty and risk inherent in a subsequent evaluation (e.g. an impact or results assessment) that may require excessive resources. We designed our own EA model by combining three theoretical approaches, with a holistic and pedagogic vision of the process and a flexible methodology to enable adaptation to different programs and contexts, thus fostering transferability. The EA was carried using a qualitative methodology: documentary analysis, seven semi-structured interviews with stakeholders, eight direct observation sessions and a check-list for politicians and experts. The outcome report helped promote organizational learning, provided the program with a logical and assessable theoretical model, detected its strengths and helped overcome the barriers to efficient assessment. Based on these achievements, an evaluation of the results was recommended, with repeated pretest-posttest measurements and an equivalent control group.

The study which was anchored on the stakeholder theory as well as the Context Input Process Product (CIPP) model of evaluation used mixed methods research design with ex-post facto and case study as its two research elements. The mixed methods was adopted because when both qualitative and quantitative approaches are used in a single study, the strengths of both produce a research synergy in which the collective benefits are greater than what is obtained from either approach when used alone. A sample size of 186 participants was selected from seven (7) primary schools using stratified random sampling. The participants selected purposively included pupils, teachers, head teachers, parents, Area Education Officer (AEO) and project staff. Data was collected using questionnaires, face to face interview guide, Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and document analysis guide. The study findings indicated that the project was implemented with great success as indicated by stakeholders' capacity to understand project objectives, their involvement in project planning and implementation and their positive attitude towards the project. This has contribute to poverty reduction in the community through the project and sustainable approaches for project implementation.

Yet, evidence of effects of interventions to enhance the social capital are lacking. The intervention mapping method has been described as a useful tool for developing workplace interventions but it is very resource consuming. We aimed to develop an adapted version of the intervention mapping method which is more practically feasible to apply. To get insight into strengths and weaknesses of the adapted method, we applied it and conducted interviews with staff at six companies. The interviews revealed that the action plans developed using the adapted intervention mapping method were generally perceived as relevant and that the action plans had a positive effect on the social capital. However, the implementation of the action plans had been a challenge. In conclusion, the adapted intervention mapping method appears to be suitable for developing interventions to enhance the social capital in the workplace. However, more attention to the implementation of the action plans needs to be incorporated into the method. Suggestions to enhance the implementation included the involvement of the management in the implementation and monitoring of the implementation of the action plans as well as integrating the action plans into existing procedures in the workplace.

The present work utilized a comprehensive literature review to understand the evaluation criteria for PPP projects throughout the early-stage planning process. A qualitative meta-synthesis was employed to identify critical factors for PPP and e-government, with a particular focus on developing countries, PPP, and e-government criteria. Our research presents a framework named \"PPP4e-Gov\" (public-private partnerships for e-government). The framework compares risk and value factors of e-government PPP projects and adopts a weighted scoring model that estimates the risks that should be considered in a project and how much value a given e-government initiative may generate if the PPP option is chosen. As an illustration of how the framework may be used, the paper interviewed ten practitioners in Costa Rica who tried out PPP4e-Gov and showcased how to plan their e-government initiatives.

Recent AEA member views on professionalization The professionalization of evaluation continues to be debated at numerous conferences in the U.S. and abroad. At this time, AEA member views on the potential benefits and negative side effects of professionalization are essential as the discussion evolves. This study provides recent views on major topics in professionalization, including potential benefits, negative side effects, processes, competencies, and procedures. Results from in-depth interviews and an online survey demonstrate that AEA members view potential benefits of professionalization to be stakeholder trust, evaluator reputation and identity, while concerns about a potential negative side effect known as the \"narrowing effect\" (i.e., some evaluators will be alienated based on their background, competencies, etc.) were expressed by participants. These recent findings can inform the ongoing discussion of professionalization, and suggest new directions for future research on evaluation.

Project satisfaction and sustainability would only be achieved if consistent with the actual needs of the people intended to benefit. Based on field experiences in the Fantekwa District of Eastern Ghana, this study aims to explore the utility of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) in prioritizing livelihood activities to aid in effective and sustainable poverty reduction interventions in developing countries. Data from twenty five development stakeholders in the district were used for the assessment. The study demonstrates that with appropriate data, and systematically following all required processes, the AHP approach can effectively show where intervention is most needed. Application of AHP in the current context, the study argues, has the potential to address the issue of wrong development targeting with associated counterproductive and nonstarter outcomes.

This study employed Group Concept Mapping (GCM) methodology to delineate a conceptual framework, from the perspective of foster youth and alumni (N = 51), for the development of on-campus support initiatives. GCM is an integrated mixed-method research method that uses non-metric multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analyses, to analyze qualitative data (e.g., statement form) collected during brainstorming sessions. This research was guided by two separate queries: (1) How do foster youth/alumni conceptualize support programs to support foster youth/alumni through to degree completion; and, (2) Is there a difference in priority areas of this conceptualization between current college students, and those who have dropped out of college within the last 18 months? Analyses revealed that participants conceptualized on-campus support programs via an eight-cluster solution, including Campus Awareness, Advocacy, Data Tracking, Pre-College Supports, Fostering Family Connections, Academic Financing, Campus Life, and Peer/Mentor Supports clusters. Additionally, analyses revealed significant priority ratings between areas of this conceptualization. In terms of Importance to academic success, current students rated statements in the Academic Financing and Peer/Mentor Supports clusters significantly lower than did non-students. For Feasibility, current students viewed statements in the Data Tracking, Campus Life, and Peer/Mentor Supports clusters as significantly more feasible than non-students. Pragmatic implications derived from these findings include fostering inclusive campus environments for foster youth/alumni and advocacy undertakings by institutions, on behalf of this population.

However, there are few evidence-informed protocols or models that can guide the development of online training content in a way that is consistent with instructional best practices. This paper presents an evidence-informed protocol for developing a training website, or online training platform, to support the implementation of community-based interventions at scale, which was informed by a critical analysis of the instructional design literature and our experiences developing an online training platform for the HealtheStepsTM Lifestyle Prescription Program. The protocol is an operationalization of the ADDIE model of instructional design, and details the analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation stages of the process. Examples from the HealtheStepsTM program are used to illustrate the use of the protocol in practice. The protocol emphasizes the need for rigorous analysis of the target audience and a multidisciplinary literature base drawing from instructional design and implementation science. It can be used by researchers to guide the development of online training platforms to support the widespread implementation of evidence-based health interventions, thus increasing their public health impact.

Literature on program-diffusion and school-university partnerships guided data collection and analysis. Data sources included semi-structured interviews with the program implementation team (n = 9) and the school's health and physical education teachers (n = 7); a focus group interview with students; documents (e.g., lesson plans), and observations. Constant comparison techniques were used to code and draw out themes from the data. Findings revealed the extensive effort needed for program implementation and highlighted the importance of strong external support mechanisms, conducting needs assessments, and training teachers to market physical activity programming. Partnerships may provide critical support for schools in their efforts to generate and sustain CSPAPs.

Elements of programme planning and evaluation on the one hand, and capacity building on the other, are needed. The latter entails approaches and processes that may contribute to community empowerment; universities may either lead such approaches, or be key partners in an endeavour to empower communities to address the challenges posed by the need for sustainable development. Although capacity building and the promotion of sustainable development locally, are on the agenda for universities who take seriously regional engagement, very little is published that illustrates or describes the various forms of activities that take place. Further, there is a paucity of studies that have evaluated the work performed by universities in building capacity for sustainable development at the local level. This paper is an attempt to address this need, and entails an empirical study based on a sample of universities in the United Kingdom, Germany, Portugal and Brazil. The paper examines the extent to which capacity building for sustainable development is being undertaken, suggests the forms that this might take and evaluates some of the benefits for local communities. The paper concludes by reinforcing that universities have a critical role to play in community development; that role has to prioritise the sustainability agenda.

To help us expand upon our understanding of context, we borrow the concept of \"space\" from the critical geographers, as it provides a bridge between the social and geographic complexities of context, enabling us to more fully capture the social and relational dynamic that fundamentally defines participatory evaluation. Our focus is on understanding context and relationships as two interconnected, dynamic and constituent parts of evaluation practices that feature participatory spaces. We then turn to a comparative analysis of participatory practice across two published reviews of distinct sets of empirical studies as a way to extend our understanding of participatory evaluation in relation to its practical, and frequently complex, contextual expressions in the field. This comparative analysis enables us to develop a set of five dimensions (epistemic, temporal/historical, cultural, economic/organizational, political) that we believe captures the spatial and contextual characteristics and contours of participatory practice.

This paper also aims to examine the different viewpoints of sustainability issues and the preventive actions taken by companies in terms of controlling carbon dioxide emissions and proper disposal of tires, lubricant oils, accessories and spare parts. Finally, taking the perspective of these companies, this paper examines their difficulties in meeting environmental regulations. The research involved a survey completed by 185 representatives of different types of companies, including shippers (represented by manufacturers), LSPs (logistics service providers) and carriers. The non-linear canonical correlation was calculated to verify the opinions of these representatives from different companies regarding issues that impact on the environment, the preventive actions they adopt to reduce their environmental impact and their difficulties in meeting environmental regulations. The results show that shippers and LSPs have the same perceptions regarding these sustainability issues and preventive actions. In addition, the companies perceive high costs and the lack of training for their partners as the major challenges experienced in addressing these issues and undertaking preventive actions. Therefore they need to plan their transportation activities.

Establishing an organized and effective protocol for participant follow-up is crucial to reduce attrition and maintain high retention rates. This paper describes our methods in using and adapting the evidence-based Engagement, Verification, Maintenance, and Confirmation (EVMC) model to follow up with adolescents 6 and 12 months after implementation of a health program. It extends previous research by focusing on two key modifications to the model: (1) the central role of cell phones and texting to maintain contact with study participants throughout the EVMC process and, (2) use of responsive two-way communication between staff and participants and flexible administration modes and methods in the confirmation phase to ensure that busy teens not only respond to contacts, but also complete data collection. These strategies have resulted in high overall retention rates (87-91%) with adolescent study participants at each follow-up data collection point without the utilization of other, more involved tracking measures. The methods and findings presented may be valuable for other researchers with limited resources planning for or engaged in collecting follow-up outcome data from adolescents enrolled in longitudinal studies.

However, its agrarian composition is based on two markedly different production models, particularly in relation to sustainability: a peasant family agriculture, which plays an important role in food production for domestic consumption and advocates agro-ecological practises; and agribusiness, the politically and economically hegemonic model that produces commodities for export based on monoculture and intensive use of pesticides. Therefore, in order to create the means to develop peasant lands, social movements and peasants have engaged themselves politically and defended an education model grounded in sustainable practises of production and social organisation. Taking this into account, the main purpose of this paper is to analyse and assess the Brazilian experience of integration between education and sustainability, in the National Education Program in Agrarian Reform (PRONERA). To accomplish this aim, a survey with a semi-structured questionnaire was carried out among teachers, students, monitors, and coordinators of the course offered by PRONERA. The surveys showed that the courses are promoting the concepts of sustainability among peasants. However, many adjustments need to be taken into consideration during the planning process for the next courses offered by PRONERA.

The external analysis is closely linked with the students' future jobs, their labour opportunities available to them after graduation. The innovative treatment of the data is exportable to the evaluation of programmes of other degrees because it allows the description linked to its characteristics and its design through the students' point of view.

The idea is to scrutinize and measure the suitability of support services in order to give recommendations for the improvement of a support planning process. We examined the applied support services and matched them with the problems and needs of SMEs, based on the survey conducted in 2013 on a sample of 336 SMEs in Serbia. We defined and analysed the five research questions that refer to support services, their consistency with the SMEs' problems and needs, and the relation between the given support and SMEs' success. The survey results have shown a statistically significant connection between them. Based on this result, we proposed an eight-phase model as a method for the improvement of support service planning for SMEs. This model helps SMEs to plan better their requirements in terms of support; government and administration bodies at all levels and organizations that provide support services to understand better SMEs' problems and needs for support.

An electronic open questionnaire was sent to occupational well-being groups in Finland (N=18) and in Estonia (N=39). In Finland, the questionnaire was responded to by 16 (n=16) occupational well-being groups, and in Estonia, by 38 (n=38) groups. The qualitative data were analyzed using the inductive-deductive method and content analysis. The obtained results indicate that the schools had named goals for action plans in all aspects of the promotion of occupational well-being in schools (worker and work, working conditions, professional competence, working community) and that these goals were mainly realized in the schools in a systematic way. Schools felt that the action plan for occupational well-being helped them to set goals for occupational well-being and that the planned actions were realized in a more systematic way than before.

To address this knowledge gap, community integration programs identified through directories and snowball sampling were sent an online survey addressing program costs and organizational attributes. 64 Responses were received for which annual per person costs (APPC) could be computed. Programs were categorized by type of services provided. Program types differed in median APPCs, though median APPCs identified were consistent with the ranges identified in the limited literature available. Multiple regression was used to identify organizational variables underlying APPCs such as psychosocial rehabilitation program type, provision of EBPs, number of volunteers, and percentage of budget spent on direct care staff, though effects sizes were moderate at best. This study adds tentative prices to the menu of community integration programs, and the implications of these findings for choosing, designing and evaluating programs addressing community integration are discussed.

The project's broader goals included an attempt to trigger a change in Italian local development strategies, especially for mountain and inland areas, which would be tailored to the real needs of communities, and based on a sustainable exploitation and management of the territorial assets. The goal was not achieved, and this paper addresses the issues of how GC could have been more effective in fostering a vision of change, and which design adaptations and evaluation procedures would have allowed the project to better cope with the unexpected consequences and resistances it encountered. The conclusions drawn are that projects should be conceived, designed and carried out as dynamic systems, inclusive of a dynamic and engaged evaluation enabling the generation of feedbacks loops, iteratively interpreting the narratives and dynamics unfolding within the project, and actively monitoring the potential of various relationships among project participants for generating positive social change.

There have been few explorations of the factors affecting the use of findings from internal evaluations that are carried out by program staff in community organizations. This study examined the instrumental use of internal evaluation findings within 19 community mental health organizations in Ontario, Canada. All but one respondent reported instrumental use in their organization, using the evaluation findings to make program-related decisions. For these non-controversial programs, qualities such as the ability of internal evaluators to identify relevant information, their role/expertise within the organization and the consistency of evaluation findings with current understanding appeared to influence use more strongly than evaluator objectivity.

Crowdsourcing is the harnessing of the abilities of many people to complete a specific task or a set of tasks. In this study multiple samples of crowdsourced individuals were asked to rate and select supporting quotes from two different transcripts. The findings indicate that the different crowdsourced samples produced nearly identical ratings of the transcripts, and were able to consistently select the same supporting text from the transcripts. These findings suggest that crowdsourcing, with further development, can potentially be used as a mixed method tool to offer a supplemental perspective on transcribed interviews.

This paper discusses the utility of mixed method evaluation designs which integrate qualitative and quantitative data through a sequential transformative process. Sequential mixed method data collection strategies involve collecting data in an iterative process whereby data collected in one phase contribute to data collected in the next. This is done through examples from a programme addressing the 'Reorientation of University Curricula to Address Sustainability (RUCAS): A European Commission Tempus-funded Programme'. It is argued that the two approaches are complementary and that there are significant gains from combining both. Using methods from both research paradigms does not, however, mean that the inherent differences among epistemologies and methodologies should be neglected. Based on this experience, it is recommended that using a sequential transformative mixed method evaluation can produce more robust results than could be accomplished using a single approach in programme planning and evaluation focussed on education for sustainable development.

In addition, sustainable consumption, a moderating variable of the country-of-origin effect (not been identified in other studies), and consumers' gender and familiarity with the country are investigated as moderating variables. The empirical research is of a descriptive nature, and in terms of data collection, a survey method has been used on a sample of undergraduate students from foreign institutions. In total, 427 questionnaires have been considered in the analysis. The results of a multiple regression analyses show that the dimensions of country image (affective, political, technical and sustainability) are reliable factors that have a positive influence on conations toward Brazil, with the affective dimension exerting the strongest influence. Further comparisons show that the sustainability dimension is more important in shaping the conations of female respondents and those with low familiarity with Brazil, whereas the political dimension is more relevant in shaping the conations of male respondents and those with high familiarity with Brazil. Finally, the sustainability dimension has a minor influence on individuals with higher levels of sustainable consumption.

FORmative Evaluation Consultation And Systems Technique (FORECAST) is a formative evaluation approach that develops a set of models and processes that can be used across settings and times, while allowing for local adaptations and innovations. FORECAST integrates specific models and tools to improve limitations in program theory, implementation, and evaluation. In the period since its initial use in a federally funded community prevention project in the early 1990s, evaluators have incorporated important formative evaluation innovations into FORECAST, including the integration of feedback loops and proximal outcome evaluation. In addition, FORECAST has been applied in a randomized community research trial. In this article, we describe updates to FORECAST and the implications of FORECAST for ameliorating failures in program theory, implementation, and evaluation.

The Permanency Innovations Initiative is a five-year federal demonstration project intended to generate evidence to reduce long stays in foster care for those youth who encounter the most substantial barriers to permanency. This article describes a systematic and staged approach to implementation and evaluation of a PII project that included usability testing as one of its key activities. Usability testing is an industry-derived practice which analyzes early implementation processes and evaluation procedures before they are finalized. This article describes the iterative selection, testing, and analysis of nine usability metrics that were designed to assess three important constructs of the project's initial implementation and evaluation: intervening early, obtaining consent, and engaging parents. Results showed that seven of nine metrics met a predetermined target. This study demonstrates how findings from usability testing influenced the initial implementation and formative evaluation of an evidence-supported intervention. Implications are discussed for usability testing as a quality improvement cycle that may contribute to better operationalized interventions and more reliable, valid, and replicable evidence.

More specifically, since 1999, aid-dependent countries have been facing pressure to strengthen their national M&E systems, while donors have been asked to refrain from using their own parallel systems and to rely instead on country systems. Surprisingly, attempts to strengthen national M&E frameworks have thus far largely overlooked the potential of national evaluation societies (NES). Similarly, NES have also remained off the academic radar. Our study aims to fill this gap by mapping key features of NES, as well as their perceived contributions to country-led M&E. In this effort, we rely upon evidence from our survey of 23 NES in Sub-Saharan African countries with Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PSRP). Our findings show that there is quite some diversity among NES. Overall, NES are active organisations, whose unique membership features a wide variety of national M&E stakeholders who potentially play key roles in country-led and localised M&E development. Major obstacles faced by NES include the lack of financial resources, donor support and political influence. Survey findings also demonstrate that the increasing interest of donors and governments in NES has yet to materialise into strategic support.

Fishery management in Grand-Popo, Benin is characterized by ambiguity, that is contrasting views among fishery stakeholders about what should be done, why, how, where, and when to resolve fishery problems like the depletion of fish-stock and absence of income alternatives. It was also characterized by great gaps (mismatches) between interventionists' plans and actions, despite generations of interventions and evaluations of their effectiveness. The RE approach aimed at facilitating interactions between interventionists and fishing people to stimulate learning and hence reduce the ambiguity and mismatches. In this article, we take distance and evaluate the results of this action research approach. We found that in the interaction some learning indeed occurred. The fishing people learned among others that intervention resources are limited and that they should organize themselves to lobby for and monitor interventions to solve their problems. Interventionists learned that they could share knowledge about their roles and limited resources with fishing people so that the latter could lobby for more resources. Fishing people however, did not learn to adopt more sustainable fishing practices. Also, interventionists did not learn to influence politicians and financial partners themselves for sufficient resources. Both categories of stakeholders developed ideas for how to collaborate to improve fishery management. We conclude that although some single-loop, double-loop and social learning occurred, the learning was limited and reflect on the related challenges for RE in natural resource management.

Jail diversion is one means by which people with mental illness are treated in the community - often with some criminal justice system oversight - instead of being incarcerated. Jail diversion may lead to immediate reductions in taxpayer costs because the person is no longer significantly engaged with the criminal justice system. It may also lead to longer term reductions in costs because effective treatment may ameliorate symptoms, reduce the number of future offenses, and thus subsequent arrests and incarceration. This study estimates the impact on taxpayer costs of a model jail diversion program for people with serious mental illness. Administrative data on criminal justice and treatment events were combined with primary and secondary data on the costs of each event. Propensity score methods and a quasi-experimental design were used to compare treatment and criminal justice costs for a group of people who were diverted to a group of people who were not diverted. Diversion was associated with approximately $2800 lower taxpayer costs per person 2 years after the point of diversion (p<.05). Reductions in criminal justice costs drove this result. Jail diversion for people with mental illness may thus be justified fiscally.

This paper examined the continuation of physically active lessons (PAL) in five Norwegian elementary schools, two years after a 10-month intervention period, which consisted of weekly minimum 2 x 45 min of PAL. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with nine teachers and five school leaders. The Level of Use instrument was used to assess how the teachers integrated PAL into the school day. Two years after the intervention period, seven of nine teachers conducted PAL regularly, on average one lesson per week. Teachers' implementation progress varied from struggling with logistics, to stable routine and creative adaption. Perceived benefits for the children, active leadership, and ongoing implementation support seem important for continuation. Introduction of PAL as a school development project, systematic planning from the onset and a gradual introduction of PAL, can be an effective strategy for continuation and long-term sustainability. In addition, the Level of Use instrument was useful to better understand which support mechanisms are needed at different stages in the implementation of PAL. Primary school; Physical activity intervention; Sustainability; Level of The development of Maisha, a video-assisted counseling intervention to address HIV stigma at entry into antenatal care in Tanzania HIV stigma has a profound impact on clinical outcomes and undermines the quality of life of people living with HIV (PLWH). Among HIV-negative individuals, misinformation and prejudicial attitudes about HIV can fuel stigma and contribute to discrimination against PLWH. Antenatal care (ANC), with its focus on universal HIV testing, provides a unique entry point to address HIV stigma. This study describes the development of a counseling intervention to address HIV stigma among women and their partners attending a first ANC appointment in Tanzania. Formative work to inform the intervention consisted of qualitative interviews with 32 pregnant and postpartum women (both women living with HIV and HIV-negative women) and 20 healthcare workers. Data were analyzed iteratively, using a thematic analysis approach, to identify intervention targets. The resulting intervention, Maisha (Swahili for \"Life\"), includes three sessions informed by the HIV Stigma Framework and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy: a video and brief counseling session prior to HIV testing and, for those who test seropositive for HIV, two additional sessions building on the video content. A pilot test of the intervention is in process. Addressing HIV stigma at the first ANC visit can help individuals living with HIV to overcome stigma-related barriers to the initiation and maintenance of HIV care, and can reduce stigmatizing attitudes among those who test negative for HIV.

Knippler, Kisigo, Godfrey Ngocho, article programme evaluation: A problem of knowledge This article conceptualises the problem of selecting teaching content that supports the practice of programme evaluation. Knowledge for evaluation practice falls within one of three categories of knowledge that are defined by the different roles they play in supporting practice. First, core knowledge relates to the defining activity of evaluation practice, i.e., that it informs the intellectual task of the determination of a programme's value. Second, accessory knowledge informs activities that support and facilitate the concretisation of the previous activity in a delivery context (e.g., stakeholder participation, evaluation use, project management, etc.). Third and finally, supplementary knowledge informs activities that may, on occasion, occur during evaluation practice, but without relating to the determination of value, either inherently or in a support role. The selection of knowledge for the teaching of evaluation must match the knowledge needed for the pursuit of effective evaluation practice: core, accessory, and supplementary knowledge. The specifics of these three needs ultimately depend on the characteristics of a given practice. The selection of content for the teaching of evaluation should ideally address these specific needs with the best knowledge available, regardless of its disciplinary origins.

Just as programs grow and develop, so can standalone interventions. This paper focused on building and evaluating a purpose intervention to scaffold adolescents and young adults' search for purpose. Four studies were conducted at each phase of the intervention's lifespan to assess if modifications were needed and to test the viable validity of using online activities to increase both the search for and the discovery of a purpose in life. These studies can be viewed through the lens of the Evolutionary Evaluation framework. Study 1 evaluated the intervention at its initiation phase, which consisted of developing and testing the intervention activities. Study 2 tested the intervention during the development phase to determine which activities most effectively increased rates of purpose. Study 3 evaluated the intervention in its stability phase by experimentally testing all activities together in a full curriculum via Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Finally, study 4 assessed the dissemination of the intervention by testing the full curriculum with over 500 high school and college students. These studies suggest that the fostering purpose intervention cultivated purpose among adolescents and young adults. Additionally, the success of the intervention demonstrates that the Evolutionary Evaluation framework may be an effective model with which to develop an intervention, from initiation through dissemination phases.

Enterprise architecture is a set of processes that helps an organization to translate its vision into an effective change in the organization's scope by providing a clear understanding of its current state. The purpose of this research is to identify EA quality attributes and its evaluation indicators in the organization. This study was conducted by using mixed method, including qualitative and quantitative parts. In the qualitative section, a variety of EA evaluation indicators were identified by a systematic literature review (SLR) approach, then in the quantitative section the survey data were collected by a questionnaire prepared based on the qualitative part and then exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were performed. This research presents an EA evaluation model that has seven main quality attributes including alignment and integrity, quality of EA products and services, security, maintainability and portability, reliability, reusability and scalability, and 30 indicators that address all aspects of enterprise architecture. Through this model, organizations can evaluate the quality of implemented EA or AS-IS status of EA and take steps to improve it.

In doing so establishing an empirical foundation for human trafficking prevention research. To achieve this aim, researchers employed Group Concept Mapping (GCM). GCM is an integrated, mixed-method, research design that analyzes qualitative data via quantitative approaches, namely multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analyses. All participants (N = 35) identified as human trafficking survivors from one of four states in the United States. Results indicate that survivors in this sample conceptualize prevention via a 10-cluster solution. Furthermore survivors rated the cluster on Education and Awareness (9) as the most Important (4.60), as well as the most Feasible (4.28).

By conducting the first phase in realist evaluation, qualitative interviews with five managerial stakeholders from two northern Swedish initiatives and reviews of documents were carried out for data collection. Using thematic analysis and retroductive reasoning, an intervention-context-actors-mechanisms-outcomes configuration was developed to elicit an initial programme theory that explained how the initiatives were presumed to operate and under what contextual contingencies. The results indicate that the intervention is expected to improve the youths' wellbeing and engage them in work or studies by strengthening their competence and confidence in a caring and collaborative context. To incorporate the diverse voices and heterogeneous experiences of youth themselves, and ascertain whether the intervention works as intended, for whom, in what conditions and why, the results now need to be tested in selected cases and refined in subsequent phases of evaluation research.

Archival data were obtained on 2330 students reading below benchmark in Grades 2-5. After propensity score matching participants to peers who did not attend the summer program, the final sample consisted of 630 students. Pre-to-posttest growth models revealed positive effects in Grades 2-4 (standardized slopes of .40-.54), but fifth graders demonstrated negligible improvement (standardized slope of .15). The standardized mean differences of propensity score matched treatment and control group students indicated null effects in all grade levels (d = .13 to .05). Achieving proficient reading performance also was not attributable to summer school participation. Findings underscore the importance of operationalizing effectiveness in summative evaluation.

While previous has focused on sexual violence occurring in correctional facilities, there has been a dearth of studies that document the expertise, experience, or reflections of program following the cimplementation of PREA- within a correctional system. The current study utilizes a \"lessons learned\" approach to discuss the impact of the PREA Demonstration Project on a state prison system that includes 19 correctional institutions. Results indicate the benefits of merging the philosophical orientation of key stakeholders, establishing benchmarks, and the need for partnerships with prosecutors. A comparison of the perceptions of correctional administrators, inmates, and front-line correctional officers regarding PREA is included. Also featured are the \"lessons learned\" from the implementation of PREA into four prison sites, along with the concept of building trust and the impact of lockdowns due to staff shortages.

The objective of our analysis was to evaluate the quality of CM counseling in health institutions of the public sector using the Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) technique. We specifically analyzed whether health-service providers informed CM users of all the side effects they might experience, as specified under the Mexican health-care regulations. Our results demonstrated that, among the four CM analyzed -the intrauterine device, hormonal injection, condom and subdermal implant- only the users of the subdermal implant received complete information on side effects. Our findings thus indicate that the quality of family planning services in the institutions analyzed is deficient. We recommend that service providers be regularly trained in order to improve their performance and that LQAS methodology be adopted as an effective means of regularly monitoring the quality of health services in Mexico. Contraceptive methods; Side effects; Youth Peer Led Lifestyle Modification Interventions: A Narrative Literature Review The prevalence of obesity remains high among school age children and continues to rise among adolescents in the United States. One strategy to address this challenge is to use peer rather than professional leaders to run weight management programs. Youth peer-led lifestyle interventions have become increasingly common over the last few decades, but there is a lack of review and synthesis of these programs. The purpose of this manuscript was to critically review and synthesize results and lessons learned from evaluated youth peer-led lifestyle modification and weight management programs. We searched the PubMed/MEDLINE database to identify articles published between March 2002 and December 2015. We identified 29 interventions including children from kindergarten to 12th grade from different settings and racial/ethnic and economic backgrounds. We first summarized descriptive information about the interventions and then compared outcomes based on intervention type, peer leader characteristics and training, and other related factors. Our review indicated that youth peer-led interventions of varying structure and content can result in positive changes in behavioral influences, diet, physical activity, body measures and other clinical outcomes. We used information from our analysis to formulate recommendations for design of future youth peer-led lifestyle interventions. health education; diet; peer led Patricia Arniella, Guedy Horowitz, Carol R. oai:RePEc:eee:epplan:v:83:y:2020:i:c:s01497189203017492020-12-23RePEc:eee:epplan article Assessing the Implementation Fidelity of Early Interventions: Data Collection Methods Several dimensions of implementation fidelity must be assessed.The strengths of one method should counterbalance the weaknesses of another.Evolving nature of implementation: multiple collection time points are needed.A self-reported checklist can serve as a guide to participants to improve fidelity.

In this study, we explore the dynamics between innovation, institutional quality, and foreign-aid flows in middle-income countries. Using an appropriate econometric model, we investigate the links between these variables in 79 middle-income countries (MICs) over 2005-2020. The results from our study show that foreign aid, institutional quality, and innovation have strong endogenous relationships. The short-run outcomes show that innovation Granger-causes institutional quality; foreign aid Granger-causes innovation; and quality of institutions Granger-causes foreign aid. The long-run outcomes indicate that institutional quality and innovation significantly affect the flow of foreign aid to the MICs. These results indicate that policy-makers in both foreign aid donor and recipient countries should pursue appropriate policies on foreign aid, quality of institutions, and innovation. For instance, in the short run, planners and evaluators in donor countries can direct their aid to MICs that have persistent challenges in improving their institutions and enhancing their innovative capabilities. In the long run, recipient countries ought to recognize that their institutional quality and innovation have a considerable impact on the inflows of foreign aid to their countries.

The secondary data for levels of anaemia and personal records of individuals collected for India from the 7th phase of District Health Survey program of the United States Agency for International Development data depository. The data was cleaned and summarised using frequency and percentages. Then the variables were tested for association with levels of anaemia using the Chi-square (2) test. The multinomial logistic regression model was employed to ascertain the key indicators through a conditional selection of reference categories. Results suggest that severe anaemia was significantly prevalent among women in the reproductive stage, especially among the 15-29 age groups. Secondary and higher education had a negative effect on the severity of severe, moderate, and mild anaemia. The poorest wealth index stratum had higher and more significant severe anaemia, and households with two adults of the opposite sex had a significant negative effect ( = 0.116, OR = 0.89, p < 0.001) on severe anaemia level while having a significant positive effect on moderate and mild anaemia. Rural households were associated negatively and significantly with moderate and mild anaemia, and nuclear household structures had a higher prevalence of severe anaemia. Therefore, these indicators across different levels of anaemia should be considered for a faster rate of reduction at the national level. Despite several initiatives by the public sector, the anaemia level has remained elevated among women of reproductive age. Education, wealth index, age, pregnancy, relationship structure, household structure, and place of residence were found to be key indicators for the level of anaemia. The significant variables will act as a crucial input to formulate cost-effective public interventions and finally encourage the faster reduction of anaemia levels.

Knowledge of strategies and decision-making issues is crucial for improving hospital services during the HSM implementation since it directly impacts the efficiency of the hospital and the level of the patient healthcare system. To address the research gap, this study presents a hybrid decision making model that combines the Analysis Hierarchical Process (AHP) method and the Analytic Network Process (ANP) to select Balanced Scorecard Policy (BSP) indicators for evaluating HSM application in a resource-limited background. The hybrid modeling approach not only assists in allocating resources for the execution of HSM but also in determining the significance of the relationship between each analyzed aspect. The hierarchical structure used in this study's quantitative and qualitative relations assessment can also assist various medical facilities in determining how the evaluation criteria and the resources needed to provide HSM services are related. In addition, the management decision policy is shown by the BSP in a healthcare center by combining the two methods mentioned satisfy the goal of strategy weights and limited resources. Finally, the article results indicate that the proposed method increases the efficiency of decisions and maximizes the can improve the reliability in HSM.

To encourage a sustainable PA practice for inactive patients with chronic diseases, France has recently implemented PA resumption programs, in which patients can participate with a medical prescription but which are time-limited. In the literature, the effectiveness of those exercise referral schemes to foster sustainable PA practice is still mixed. The present study aims at capitalizing the experience of eight resumption programs to understand what makes the programs work, adherence mechanisms and the post-program referral scheme. Questionnaires and semi-structured interviews informed those intervention mechanisms analysed using thematic analysis. This study provides insights into expertize in patient management among these programs, currently due to key findings as the employment of adapted PA teachers, their training and the use of mechanisms for program adherence (practice conditions, emphasize progress and feelings generated by exercise, the relational and social aspect of practice). Other key findings are a lack of clarity in program objectives which is an area of improvement, and a broad diversity of referral (transmitting contact details, contacting the club, intervention of a third-party association or physical presence) that need further exploration.

Some of these experiences of cognitive impairments can be improved by appropriate movement and physical activity interventions, delivered in ways which take into account an individual's preferences, needs and abilities. A clear intervention programme theory (how we expect an intervention to work) can improve effectiveness, acceptability, transferability and sustainability. We used a systematic framework (Six Steps in Quality Intervention Development) and a co-production approach, to develop an intervention programme theory for Care Homes Achieving Realistic Movement Strategies (CHARMS). We identified twenty factors contributing to low levels of physical activity and movement which we grouped into four categories for change: i) cultural/staff; ii) residents; iii) environmental and iv) policy/system. A theory of change was developed using these categories plus additional theories to create ownership. It became evident that the intervention (the theory of action) needed to include activities in all categories; intervening in just one category (e.g. providing weekly physical activity) was not sufficient in itself. Developing the programme theory enabled care homes to develop activities to meet their specific contextual needs and develop ownership of the process and the intervention.

Among them are professional practices as the best way to intervene in culture, with the use of comparative analysis between an organization's current practices and those expected with culture change. In this line, the organizational self-assessment tool \"Organizational Effectiveness and Efficiency Scale\" (OEES) is applied in a study with 24 organizations, which uses a collaborative assessment approach in the service of a set of evidence-based practices identified as standards in key aspects that guide culture change, specifically, a person-centered approach, participative structures, use of information systems and data management, implementation of quality systems and participative and transformational leadership. The results obtained show that a large majority of organizations have significant discrepancies between their current practices and evidence-based practices. The descriptive analysis allows affirming the usefulness of the scale for an organizational diagnosis and identification of strategies to guide transformational change.

We explored the value of this professional development to the early career evaluators, to the sponsor organization, and to the nonprofit organizations receiving CEED services by examining findings from six CEED projects. We found that early career evaluators self-reported gains in confidence and competence especially in four American Evaluation Association Evaluator Competencies (2018) domains - professional practice, methodology, planning and management, and interpersonal skills. The initiative allowed the sponsor organization to expand connections with community organizations, implement work consistent with the mission, and provide new mentoring opportunities. Representatives from the recipient nonprofit organizations reported they gained a deeper understanding of evaluation, improved their dissemination efforts, and built organizational evaluation capacity.

The instrument, High Integrity and Fidelity Implementation for School Renewal, was created using a comprehensive review of the literature to provide insights into the implementation integrity and fidelity when principals renew a school. Data from 1097 teachers were used to examine the instrument for construct validity by means of factorial validity and convergent validity. We used confirmatory factor analysis to compared five factorial structures of the instrument, resulting in the identification of a four-factor structure (coming from the comprehensive review of the literature) as the best fitting structure to the data. Strong convergent validity of the instrument was confirmed by correlating the instrument with a psychometrically established instrument measuring a similar construct. Finally, McDonald's Omega indicated strong internal consistency of the instrument in our reliability analysis.

Within the EU policies, quality of life as a criterion has been rarely used in evaluations. The concept of quality of life is vague and multidimensional. The unclear and ambiguity of the definition of what is included in the concept of quality of life makes it challenging to compare different studies with each other. The multidimensionality with pre-defined criteria makes sense when comparing the quality of life internationally or among regions. In case of improvement in quality of life, also criteria of local stakeholders need to be taken into account. Most published papers on quality of life evaluations are from health studies. The reason for such dominance lies in the importance of health conditions for the perception of the quality of life. The concept is, though, exploited in many other disciplines with various meanings. Beyond health conditions, many other factors influence the quality of life, including economic, social, work, or psychological ones. Another challenge concerns measuring the quality of life from objective and subjective perspectives. Objective factors like investment in civil infrastructure could sometimes be perceived differently across the population. Health, psychological, and social circumstances also influence the perception of quality of life. Moreover, the application of the same subjective indicator at different time points provides different information even if the same respondents participate in data collection. We can answer only partially the two questions used in the name of this contribution on why and how to use the quality of life as an evaluation criterion. It is because of the subjectivity of the understanding of the concept and multidimensionality of measuring it according to the needs of a particular evaluation.

This is particularly the case in post-conflict settings such as Northern Ireland. Evidence supported youth work interventions are an important yet under-evaluated area of violence prevention efforts. Youth work approaches have demonstrated significant utility in reaching those most at risk of violence related harm and have the potential to save lives. Street Doctors is a UK charity that seeks to empower young people affected by violence with the skills and knowledge to save lives. Despite burgeoning delivery across the United Kingdom, there has been a paucity of robust evaluations undertaken thus far. The present study reports the findings of a process and impact evaluation of Street Doctors during its pilot into Northern Ireland. The brief intervention was a highly acceptable, thus demonstrating its potential to be implemented within the context of routine youth service provision. Despite the favourable attitudes of participants, no effects were found. Practical implications are discussed.

Adolescent health; Covid-19; Coronavirus; Intervention article Culturally A scoping review of the evaluation literature Evaluators have become increasingly aware of the influence of culture in evaluation, leading to new evaluation approaches that account for the cultural considerations in which evaluations are situated. This scoping review sought to explore how evaluators understand culturally responsive evaluation and identify promising practices. A search of nine evaluation journals yielded 52 articles that were included in this review. Nearly two-thirds of the articles stated that community involvement was essential to culturally responsive evaluation. Power differentials were discussed in almost half of the articles, and the majority used participatory or collaborative approaches to community engagement. Findings from this review suggest that in culturally responsive evaluation, evaluators prioritize community involvement and have an awareness and attentiveness to power differentials. Yet, gaps exist in how culture and evaluation are defined and interpreted, and consequently, inconsistency in how culturally responsive evaluation is practiced.

The necessary approvals for the study were obtained. The data set was created by obtaining patient data (except for data such as Turkish Republic identification number) from 14 hospitals providing Home Health Care Services in the city of Diyarbakr. The data set was subjected to necessary pre-processing and descriptive statistics were applied. For the estimation model, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network algorithms were used. It was found that the number of days of home health care service, which the patients received, varied depending on their age and gender. It was observed that the patients were generally in the disease groups that required Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation treatments. It was determined that the length of service for patients can be predicted with a high reliability rate (Multi-Layer Model Acc: 90.4%, Decision Tree Model Acc: 86.4%, Random Forest Model Acc: 88.5%) using machine learning algorithms. In the light of the findings and data patterns obtained in the study, it is thought that effective and efficient planning will be made in terms of health management. In addition, it is believed that estimating the average length of service for patients will contribute to strategic planning of human resources for health, and to reducing medical consumables, drugs and hospital expenses.

While there is a considerable body of literature on the conceptualization of responsibility in research and a plethora of attempts to practice RRI, there is a need for increased attention to the monitoring and evaluation of case studies of RRI implementations in research organisations, in particular regarding their structural change effects. This paper aims to discuss a contextualised developmental framework for evaluating RRI implementation in research organisations, with a specific focus on achieving structural change through tailor-made action plans. The framework, developed through RRI evaluation work in the field of biosciences, adopts a systemic and process-oriented perspective, encompassing participatory, anticipatory, reflexive, and responsive dimensions. Concrete empirical examples from bioscience organizations are provided to illustrate how the framework relates to specific conditions, experiences, and solutions, demonstrating how conceptual insights have emerged from real-life practices and data analysis. While the framework was initially customized for the specific contexts of six bioscience research organizations, it holds potential for broader relevance and applicability in addressing challenges related to RRI design, implementation, and evaluation.

Still, limitations such as the use of a simply modified model and the lack of a comprehensive viewpoint are prevalent in existing approaches. In light of these research gaps, this study suggests a practical model to evaluate the performance of large-scale and publicly funded projects. The proposed model suggests a standard matrix framework of indices that evaluates the performance of particular elements in an industrial ecosystem in vertical categories and the economic and technological outcomes of those elements in horizontal categories. Based on the application of a balanced scorecard, this study uses mixed methodologies such as social network analysis, inter-industry analysis, and the analytic hierarchy process. Finally, the model evaluates the performance of Korea's Next Generation Network project as a case study.

To do so, involves examining how \"Empowerment Evaluation Theory\" has been defined at various points of time (particularly 1996 and now in 2015). Defining a theory is different from judging the success of a theory. This latter topic has been addressed elsewhere by Michael Scriven, Michael Patton, and Brad Cousins. I am initially guided by the work of Robin Miller (2010) who has written on the issue of how to judge the success of a theory. In doing so, she provided potential standards for judging the adequacy of theories. My task is not judging the adequacy or success of the Empowerment Evaluation prescriptive theory in practice, but determining how well the theory is delineated. That is, to what extent do the writings qualify as a prescriptive theory.

Social return on investment (SROI) is a popular method for evaluating the impact that organizations have on society and the environment. It has its roots in finance, where return on investment (ROI) is used to evaluate investments. Over the past ten years, SROI has made the leap from a tool for building private wealth to one that advances the public good. Has it landed us in a better place? To answer the question, I describe the general approach to financial analysis, how it is applied to financial decisions, and how it has been adapted to evaluate impact. I then consider the strengths and weaknesses of SROI, and suggest how, by pushing beyond the constraints of financial analysis, it can give stakeholders voice and provide evidence of success from diverse perspectives. Along the way, I propose a conceptual model for value, a foundational concept in SROI that has been criticized by some as underdeveloped, and I include a technical appendix that identifies potential sources of statistical bias in SROI estimates. I conclude by acknowledging our growing need to incorporate efficiency as one of multiple success criteria and the role that SROI\u2014properly implemented\u2014can play.

A secondary aim of this study was to explore priority differences in the conceptualization by self-reported gender (foster mothers vs. foster fathers). Participant data was collected via three qualitative brainstorming sessions, and analyzed using non-metric multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis. Findings indicate that foster parents participating in this study conceptualized effective mentor programs via a seven cluster solution.

Thus, there is a need to improve workplace safety and health promotion efforts for people with disability. The purpose of this study was to obtain stakeholder feedback about an online program, Be Active, Work Safe, which was developed to increase the physical activity and workplace safety practices of individuals with disability. Eight stakeholders (content experts and individuals with disability) evaluated the 8-week online program and provided feedback on accessibility, usability, and content using quantitative and qualitative approaches. Stakeholders suggested changes to the organization, layout and accessibility, and content. This included making a stronger connection between the physical activity and workplace safety components of the program, broadening content to apply to individuals in different vocational fields, and reducing the number of participant assessments. Engaging stakeholders in the development of health promotion programs is critical to ensure the unique issues of the population are addressed and facilitate engagement in the program.

Seattle's Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) program was established to divert these individuals to case management and supportive services instead of jail and prosecution. A nonrandomized controlled evaluation was conducted to examine LEAD effects on criminal recidivism (i.e., arrests, criminal charges). The sample included 318 people suspected of low-level drug and prostitution activity in downtown Seattle: 203 received LEAD, and 115 experienced the system-as-usual control condition. Analyses were conducted using logistic generalized estimating equation models over both the shorter term (i.e., six months prior and subsequent to evaluation entry) and longer term (i.e., two years prior to the LEAD start date through July 2014). Compared to controls, LEAD participants had 60% lower odds of arrest during the six months subsequent to evaluation entry; and both a 58% lower odds of arrest and 39% lower odds of being charged with a felony over the longer term. These statistically significant differences in arrests and felony charges for LEAD versus control participants indicated positive effects of the LEAD program on recidivism.

It presents problems experienced in major disasters, analyzes the failures, and suggests how a competitive system that relies on private and volunteer regional leaders, personnel, and capital can improve preparation, response and recovery efforts over the existing government system. A Public Choice approach is adopted to explain why government often fails, and how regional governance may be socially more efficient than the existing federal- state-local funded and managed disaster system. The paper suggests that the federal role might change from both funding and supplying aid in disasters to merely funding disaster recovery efforts. When a disaster occurs, available businesses and government resources in the region can be utilized under a competitive system. These resources could replace existing federal and state inventories and emergency personnel. An independent regionally controlled and managed council, which also develops its own financial resources, and local volunteer leaders are key for success.

Such coalitions often consist of a small paid staff and volunteer members. The present study examines one likely contributor to coalition effectiveness: the degree of agreement on role expectations between paid staff and volunteer members. Role confusion occurs when paid staff and volunteers differ in their expectations of who is responsible for accomplishing specific tasks. Staff and volunteer members from 69 randomly selected Drug Free Coalitions in the United States as well as 21 Drug Free Coalitions in Connecticut were asked to respond to an online survey asking about 37 specific coalition tasks critical for effective coalition functioning and the degree to which paid staff and/or voluntary members should be responsible for accomplishing each. Our final sample consisted of 476 individuals from 35 coalitions. Using coalitions as the unit of analysis, we found significant differences between paid staff and volunteer coalition members on nine tasks reflecting four domains: meeting leadership and participation, (2) planning and implementation leadership, (3) publicity/media relations, and (4) logistical functions. Implications of these differences and ways that evaluators could help coalitions deal with differing role expectations were discussed.

By analogy with its business counterpart, the Return on Investment (ROI), the SROI is a metric that compares the monetized social costs of a program with the monetized social benefits of achieving an outcome (or set of outcomes). For example, calculating the SROI of a nonprofit half-way house for drug addicts might involve estimating the reduced social costs attributable to successful rehabilitation of addicts, and comparing this to the social costs of operating the half-way house. Alternatively, the total return of a for-profit social enterprise providing affordable housing might consist both of the traditional private return on investment along with the economic value of meeting the housing needs of lower income households.

The rapid evolution of ICT also necessitates rigorous assessment of training programs by participants. Thus, this study proposes an evaluation framework based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to systematically evaluate such workshops designed for teachers. The evaluation model is decomposed hierarchically into four main criteria namely: (1) workshop design, (2) quality of content of the workshop, (3) quality of delivery of the content of the workshop, and the (4) relevance of the workshop. These criteria are further disaggregated into 24 sub-indicators to measure the effectiveness of the workshop as perceived by the participants based on their own expectations. This framework is applied to a case study of ICT workshops done in the Philippines. In this case, relevance of the workshop is found to be the most important main criterion identified by the participants, particularly on the new ICT knowledge that promotes teachers' professional growth and development. The workshop evaluation index (WEI) is also proposed as a metric to support decision-making by providing a mechanism for benchmarking performance, tracking improvement over time, and developing strategies for the design and improvement of training programs or workshops on ICT for teachers.

In response, community aged care workers may need to increase skills and uptake of knowledge into practice regarding diversity through appropriate training interventions. Diversity training (DT) programs have traditionally existed in the realm of business, with little research attention devoted to scientifically evaluating the outcomes of training directed at community aged care workers. A DT workshop has been developed for community aged care workers, and this paper focuses on the construction of a formative evaluative framework for the workshop. Key evaluation concepts and measures relating to DT have been identified in the literature and integrated into the framework, focusing on five categories: Training needs analysis; Reactions; Learning outcomes, Behavioural outcomes and Results The use of a mixed methods approach in the framework provides an additional strength, by evaluating long-term behavioural change and improvements in service delivery. As little is known about the effectiveness of DT programs for community aged care workers, the proposed framework will provide an empirical and consistent method of evaluation, to assess their impact on enhancing older people's experience of healthcare.

There is a need to train students on important academic and professional skills related to the workplace with an IT component. This article describes a statistical study that measures satisfaction levels among students in the faculty of Information Technology and Computer Science in Jordan. The objective of this study is to explore factors that influence student satisfaction with regards to enrolling in an internship training program. The study was conducted to gather student perceptions, opinions, preferences and satisfaction levels related to the program. Data were collected via a mixed method survey (surveys and interviews) from student-respondents. The survey collects demographic and background information from students, including their perception of faculty performance in the training poised to prepare them for the job market. Findings from this study show that students expect internship training to improve their professional and personal skills as well as to increase their workplace-related satisfaction. It is concluded that improving the internship training is crucial among the students as it is expected to enrich their experiences, knowledge and skills in the personal and professional life. It is also expected to increase their level of confidence when it comes to exploring their future job opportunities in the Jordanian market.

The conclusion of this special issue on Social Return On Investment (SROI) begins with a summary of both advantages and problems of SROI, many of which were identified in preceding articles. We also offer potential solutions for some of these problems that can be derived from standard evaluation practices and that are becoming expected in SROIs that follow guidances from international SROI networks. A remaining concern about SROI is that we do not yet know if SROI itself adds sufficient benefit to programs to justify its cost. Two frameworks for this proposed metaevaluation of SROI are suggested, the first comparing benefits to costs summatively (the resourceoutcome model). The second framework evaluates costs and benefits according to how much they contribute to or are caused by the different activities of SROI. This resourceactivityoutcome model could enable outcomes of SROI to be maximized within resource constraints (such as budget and time limits) on SROI. Alternatively, information from this model could help minimize the costs of achieving a specific level of return on investment from conducting SROI. Possible problems with this metaevaluation of SROI are Brian T.

This study examined the characteristics, needs, and experiences of veterans on the Connecticut VSU. This study utilized data from a quality improvement survey that was completed by 87 of the 110 veterans on the Connecticut VSU (79% response rate). The majority of veterans on the VSU were white, aged 41-56, never married, and had an honorable or general military discharge making them potentially eligible for Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare upon release. The most common psychiatric diagnoses reported by veterans were substance use disorders and 29% reported posttraumatic stress disorder. Veterans on the unit reported a variety of needs related to legal, housing, basic needs, health, income, and community re-entry. The majority of veterans reported positive experiences on the VSU with 61% reporting the VSU was better than other units they have been on. Together, these findings illustrate how regional partnerships between state Departments of Corrections and VA medical centers may benefit veterans. More rigorous evaluation of the VSU model is needed to inform innovations to address the needs of incarcerated veterans and prepare them for successful community reintegration.

Interventions to decrease HIV stigma have focused on providing information and education, changing attitudes and values, and increasing contact with people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), activities that act to reduce stereotyped beliefs and prejudice, as well as acts of discrimination. Most anti-homophobia interventions have focused on bullying reduction and have been implemented at the secondary and post-secondary education levels. Few interventions address HIV stigma and homophobia and operate at the community level. Project CHHANGE, Challenge HIV Stigma and Homophobia and Gain Empowerment, was a community-level, multi-component anti-HIV/AIDS stigma and homophobia intervention designed to reduce HIV stigma and homophobia thus increasing access to HIV prevention and treatment access. The theory-based intervention included three primary components: workshops and trainings with local residents, businesses and community-based organizations (CBO); space-based events at a CBO-partner drop-in storefront and \"pop-up\" street-based events and outreach; and a bus shelter ad campaign. This paper describes the intervention design process, resultant intervention and the study team's experiences working with the community. We conclude that CHHANGE was feasible and acceptable to the community. Promoting the labeling of gay and/or HIV-related \"space\" as a non-stigmatized, community resource, as well as providing opportunities for residents to have contact with targeted groups and to understand how HIV stigma and homophobia relate to HIV/AIDS prevalence in their neighborhood may be crucial components of successful anti-stigma and discrimination programming.

Despite the pervasive implementation of VTCs, there is little research focused specifically on VTC implementation and outcomes, which are based on other problem-solving court models such as drug court. The current study presents qualitative process evaluation data from key stakeholders (n=21) and veteran participants (n=4) to show accomplishments, challenges, and lessons learned during first-year implementation at two VTC sites. Quantitative performance data is also presented on veteran participants (n=19) served during the first year to show: types of services, monitoring, judicial interaction, sanctions/therapeutic responses, and rewards, as well as preliminary data on recidivism. Qualitative data, from both key stakeholders and veteran participants, suggests that offering rehabilitation via various program components, services/referrals, and accountability are critical to the success of the VTC. Data also provides valuable lessons learned for VTC implementation including communication, collaboration, information/protocols, and resources. Performance data shows that a variety of services are utilized and that frequent judicial interaction, drug testing, and sanctions are cornerstones of the VTC.

One appealing aspect of this approach is the possibility of remotely collecting participant data to use in program tailoring or evaluation. The purpose of the present study is to test the feasibility of using text messages to collect participant data. Using data from 33 texted evaluation questions sent through the Text2BHealthy nutrition education program for low-income parents (n=1081521) response rates under different incentive and prompting strategies were examined. Response rates are generally low across a pilot year and three program years, ranging from 10-55%. While incentives seemed to be ineffective at improving response rates, results indicate that prompting participants to respond may increase response rates. Individuals who respond to an initial question are highly likely to respond to a follow-up question (88-99%) and to report positive behaviors (68-100%). Responses received through text may be unrepresentative and positively biased. Text messages may be a supplemental data collection strategy in nutrition education programs, but low response rates and response bias undermine data quality.

The Pay For Success (PFS) and Social Impact Bond (SIB) movements to date have focused heavily on shorter-term outcomes that can be monetized and show clear savings to government entities. In part, this focus derives from the need to specify contract payments based on a narrow set of well measured outcomes (e.g., avoided days in jail and foster care, decreased use of behavioral health services). Meanwhile efforts to measure the social return on investment (SROI) of interventions have sought to expand the view of relevant outcomes to include domains that lend themselves less clearly to monetization. This paper explores the intersection between these two movements with illustrations from a SIB initiative underway focused on homeless families with children in foster care. Challenges and potential for SROI in a third-party payor environment will be discussed as well as opportunities to better leverage the strengths of both types of initiative.

Consequently, the assessment of the development of an eHealth system would reflect stakeholder approaches and become an innovative solution in attempting to improve productivity of IT projects in the field of health care. The compiled minimum set of indicators will be designed to monitor implementation of the national eHealth information system. To ensure reliability of the quality research, the respondents were grouped in accordance to the geographical distribution and diversity of the levels and types of the represented jobs and institutions. The applied analysis implies several managerial insights on the hierarchy of eHealth indicators. These insights may be helpful in recommending priority activities in implementation of an eHealth data system on the national or international level. The research is practically useful as it is the first to deal with the topic in Lithuania and its theoretical and practical aspect are particularly relevant in implementation of an eHealth data system in Lithuania. The eHealth assessment indicators presented in the article may be practically useful in two aspects: (1) as key implementation guidelines facilitating the general course of eHealth system development and (2) as a means to evaluate eHealth outcomes. eHealth; Evaluation; National monitoring; Legitimation dynamics: How SROI could mobilize resources for new constituencies The following critical essay on the social return on investment (SROI) methodology is broken into two parts. In the first section, focusing on the categorization dynamics of the SROI, I review a set of methodological and ethical tensions surrounding the SROI, using examples from my own work and other published works using SROI. These tensions include the fact that the project requires standardization to achieve comparability while concurrently offering a flexibility in constructing a narrative of impact that is attractive to users. In the second section, focusing on the legitimation dynamics, I define a narrow scope for where, despite the aforementioned pitfalls, that the SROI can be quite effective in building a rhetorical argument for directing material resources. The essay argues that despite ongoing methodological challenges, the investor lens and market logic undergirding the metric provide a powerful frame for persuasion that can be used to construct worthiness and value creation for constituents not already constructed as such.

GFE is an evaluation model where the evaluator conducts the evaluation without knowledge of or reference to the evaluand's stated goals. The four non-randomly sampled evaluation approaches represent articulated evaluation models in which the evaluators ignore the goals of the intervention or project. Data collection consisted of document analyses supplemented by semi-structured interviews with the models' creators. The findings from these case studies include descriptions of the evaluation models, the models' relationship to GFE, and eight commonalities shared among the four models. The conclusion of this study is that these GFEs are similar to other GFEs described in the literature in that they examine outcomes as reported by the intervention's consumers, focus on collecting qualitative data, and use their evaluations to supplement a larger goal-based evaluation strategy.

The research seeks to address the gap and identify the critical determinants of team effectiveness in projects undertaken by non-governmental organizations. Using a systematic process, the study involved both literature and focus group discussions to generate the required items. A total of 157 respondents (Team Members and Team Leaders) were part of the study that filled the questionnaires. Using exploratory factor analysis followed by confirmatory factor analysis, both convergent and discriminant validity was established. The present study found that team effectiveness in NGO social projects has a total of seven dimensions namely: Inter team coordination, community social linkage, team performance, knowledge, skills, and attitudes, leadership communication and engagement, decision making and information sharing, and team formation. There is a significant lack of research on team effectiveness in NGO projects. Where considerably large proportion of research on team effectiveness has focused on the corporate sector, the non-governmental teams have been neglected. This study clearly highlights the determinants that make up team effectiveness in NGOs. The determinants identified will help to specifically look at the effectiveness of teams in NGO projects. The study would help NGOs identify the dimensions in which they may be performing in a weaker manner and direct their energies in improving the factors.

However, the role of health beliefs in preconception health program outcomes has been overlooked but warrants attention due to reported positive associations between women's views of control over fetal health and health behavior in pregnancy. Towards an ultimate aim of improving preconception health program reach and effectiveness, we examined properties of a fetal health locus of control (FHLC; Labs & Wurtele, 1986) measure in nulliparous, childbearing aged university women and men. Students (n=1467) completed an online survey that included the FHLC subscales maternal, powerful others', and chance control over fetal health. Factor analyses and correlations with related scales supported the soundness of FHLC constructs in both women and men. All participants rated maternal control in fetal health nearly twice as highly as powerful others' and chance. We therefore recommend that FHLC be integrated into preconception health program evaluation as personal agency in fetal health likely has an important role in women's and men's preconception health behavior and health behavior change.

Challenges were to balance the desire for standardized assessment with the responsibility to account for individual program contexts. Toolkit contents included instructional materials about evaluation practice, a standardized applicant management tool, and a modulated outcomes measure. Resulting benefits from toolkit deployment were having cost effective, sustainable evaluation tools, a community evaluation forum, and aggregate measurement of key program outcomes for the national program. Lessons learned included the imperative of understanding the evaluation context, engaging stakeholders, and building stakeholder trust.

For the intervention materials, materials were mailed to 244 participants (99.2%) and 227 participants (92.3%) received the coaching call intervention. 92.3% received all intervention components. Participants who had full household bans at 3 months were more likely to conduct behaviors leading to a smoke-free home (i.e., making a list of reasons, having a family talk, posting a pledge) than were those with no/partial ban. The intervention materials also were rated higher in relevance and usefulness by non-smokers than smokers. Results demonstrate that this minimal intervention had high fidelity to the delivery of components and relatively high receptivity.

These groups also experience more severe complications from diabetes and have higher mortality rates as a result of the disease, such as cardiovascular disease, amputation and kidney failure. Underserved rural ethnically disparate populations benefit from health education outreach efforts that are conveyed and translated by specially-trained community health ambassadors. Project H.I.G.H. (Helping Individuals Get Healthy) was developed to target the priority areas of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Utilizing trained community health ambassadors, CDC's The Road to Health Toolkit as well as New Beginnings: A Discussion Guide for Living Well with Diabetes was used as a model for a community-based educational program. The overall goal of Project H.I.G.H was to implement and evaluate: (1) a coordinated, behavior-focused, family-centered, community-based educational program and; (2) a client service coordination effort resulting in improved health outcomes (BMI, Glucose Levels, BP) for individuals with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in Gadsden County, Florida. Overall, Project H.I.G.H. was very successful in its first year at motivating participants to delay or prevent diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease or at the very least to start taking better care of their health.

The railway safety education in schools included a 45-min lesson on safe behaviour in a railway environment directed at 8-11 year old schoolchildren. The lessons were held in four schools located near railway lines in Finland. The effectiveness of this measure was evaluated based on a short survey directed at pupils before the lesson (base level) and around 2-3 months later (post-lesson) based on three variables which are considered as strong determinants of actual behaviour: behaviour intention, estimated dangerousness of the behaviour, and level of knowledge on the legality of the behaviour. The results show that the change in the share of correct answers was positive regarding all questions except for one question in which the difference was not significant. Based on this we can reasonably assume that railway safety education in schools can have a positive effect for all the measured variables, although the effect is not necessarily large. The results indicate that these positive changes can have a positive effect on the frequency of trespassing (i.e. fewer unsafe crossings in the future). We can further assume that reduction in the frequency of trespassing would reduce the frequency of trespassing accidents.

The evaluation is a requirement of a comprehensive quality assurance process mandated by the university. A modified RUFDATA (Saunders, 2000) evaluation model is applied as an initiating framework to assist in decision making to provide a guide for conceptualizing a logic model for the quality assurance process. This article will show how an educational evaluation is strengthened by employing a RUFDATA reflective process in exploring key elements of the evaluation process, and then translating this information into a logic model format that could serve to offer a more focussed pathway for the quality assurance activities. Using preliminary program evaluation data from two key stakeholders of the undergraduate program as well as an audit of the curriculum's course syllabi, a case is made for, (1) the importance of inclusivity of key stakeholders participation in the design of the evaluation process to enrich the authenticity and accuracy of program participants' feedback, and (2) the diversification of data collection methods to ensure that stakeholders' narrative feedback is given ample exposure. It is suggested that the modified RUFDATA/logic model framework be applied to all academic programs at the university undergoing the quality assurance process at the same time so that economies of scale may be realized.

An analysis of evaluation theory and practice The concept of 'unintended outcomes' has a long history. Contributions to the topic have appeared under the guise of various disciplinary lenses, including programme evaluation. There is now solid consensus among the international evaluation community regarding the need to consider side effects as a key aspect in any evaluative study. However, this concern often equates to nothing more than false piety. In this article, shortcomings of existing theoretical developments to evaluate unintended outcomes are identified. Current evaluation practices in international development are then analysed to demonstrate ways in which unintended outcomes remain peripheral. Reasons for neglect are discussed and the need for a stronger re-focusing on unintended effects of development interventions is advocated.

Used to identify key evaluation findings, its application has proven to be effective in addressing the limitations encountered in country-level evaluation analysis conducted by the Independent Evaluation Office of the Global Environment Facility (GEF). These include the scarcity or unreliability of national statistics on environmental indicators and data series, especially in Least Developed Countries; challenges in evaluating the impacts of GEF projects; and inherent difficulties in defining the GEF portfolio of projects prior to the undertaking of the evaluation. In addition to responding to the need for further developing triangulation protocols, procedures and/or methodologies advocated by some authors, the approach offers a contribution to evaluation practice. This applies particularly to those evaluation units tasked with country-level evaluations in international organizations, facing similar constraints.

Unfortunately, there is little empirical data documenting GOTR participant changes that align with the curriculum and describe the evaluation process. Therefore, this study presents an evaluation of GOTR consisting of three main processes: curriculum content analysis and stakeholder focus groups (N=11) to identify key outcomes of the program; community-based participatory research to collaborate with program personnel to further identify important outcomes; and the design and pilot testing of an instrument (N=104) for assessing changes in the theoretically grounded outcomes over time. Findings demonstrated a positive collaborative process that led to important information to be used for an impact evaluation of Girls on the Run and for future evaluation development efforts for physical activity based positive youth development.

A formative evaluation of Families Healing Together (FHT), a new online family mental health recovery program was conducted using five waves (N=108) of data. Exploratory factor analysis of the measures identified as important to the program theory found strong reliability evidence (=.77-.86) for 6 constructs. A poor response rate (25%) did not allow for valid pre and postoutcome evaluation, however we did have enough information to assess the psychometric properties of the new measures. The new evaluation tool accounted for 34% of the variance in Capacity to Support Family Member, and nearly 50% of the variance in Hopefulness toward Recovery. New programs without existing measures require formative evaluation strategies that accurately describe program activities in order to develop outcome measures sensitive to novel aspects of program components. Most outcome measures are developed for individuals with mental health challenges not family members. These new measures may be beneficial to effectively evaluate programs that promote family recovery and wellness.

Utilizing results from the program evaluation of one public library's Cultural Navigator Program, the authors illustrate how communities and public institutions can promote integration and relationship-building between newly arrived immigrants and long-time residents. Existing social networks within receiving communities, conceptualized in this article as social capital, were leveraged to build capacity among newly arrived immigrants and foster inclusivity and integration at the community level. As a place of intervention, public libraries are suggested as a safe and shared space where community integration can be fostered. Insights derived from the evaluation inform a discussion on engaging approaches to immigrant integration. Lessons learned and recommendations for program evaluators and administrators are provided.

They propose a model consisting of levels of evidence, the aim of which is to 'bridge the gap between evidence based and evidence informed practice' (p. 218). In order to address the dearth of examples in the international literature of how organisations have dealt with these complexities in practice, this article provides a case study of how a large Irish youth organisation, For\u00f3ige, has endeavoured to adopt an inclusive approach to evidence, working towards both evidence based and evidence informed practice. Drawing on Veerman and Van Yperen's (2007) framework, the case study shows that For\u00f3ige committed itself to gathering different types of evidence, including logic models and theoretical understandings at the foundation level and experimental design studies of key programmes at the advanced level. The case study focuses in detail on the intermediate level, whereby practitioners were trained to evaluate aspects of their own work, with a view to embedding evaluation and reflection in day to day practice.

This paper aims to evaluate and rank the performance of the states in India under MGNREGA scheme. A non-parametric approach, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used to calculate the overall technical, pure technical, and scale efficiencies of states in India. The sample data is drawn from the annual official reports published by the Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India. Based on three selected input parameters (expenditure indicators) and five output parameters (employment generation indicators), I apply both input and output oriented DEA models to estimate how well the states utilize their resources and generate outputs during the financial year 2013-14. The relative performance evaluation has been made under the assumption of constant returns and also under variable returns to scale to assess the impact of scale on performance. The results indicate that the main source of inefficiency is both technical and managerial practices adopted. 11 states are overall technically efficient and operate at the optimum scale whereas 18 states are pure technical or managerially efficient. It has been found that for some states it necessary to alter scheme size to perform at par with the best performing states. For inefficient states optimal input and output targets along with the resource savings and output gains are calculated. Analysis shows that if all inefficient states operate at optimal input and output levels, on an average 17.89% of total expenditure and a total amount of $780million could have been saved in a single year. Most of the inefficient states perform poorly when it comes to the participation of women and disadvantaged sections (SC&ST) in the scheme. In order to catch up with the performance of best performing states, inefficient states on an average need to enhance women participation by 133%. In addition, the states are also ranked using the cross efficiency approach and results are analyzed. State of Tamil Nadu occupies the top position followed by Puducherry, Punjab, and Rajasthan in the ranking list. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first pan-India level study to evaluate and rank the performance of MGNREGA scheme quantitatively and so comprehensively.

Across Europe various evaluation studies have been performed. However, the methodologies applied are too heterogeneous to allow the combination of the results in a meta-analytical way. In this paper we propose a future pathway for organising outcome evaluation studies of domestic violence perpetrator programmes in community settings, so that today's problems in this field can be overcome. In a pragmatic framework that acknowledges the limited pre-conditions for evaluation studies in the area of domestic violence perpetrator programmes as it is today, feasible approaches for outcome evaluation are outlined, with recent developments in the field taken as starting points. The framework for organising future evaluation studies of work with perpetrators of domestic violence is presented together with a strategy to promote this framework. International networks of practitioners and researchers play a central role in this strategy through upskilling the area of practical work, preparing the ground for evaluation research and improving cooperation between practitioners and researchers.

To increase out-of-school-time physical activity, complementary community programs are warranted. Partnerships between universities and community organizations may help build the capacity of these organizations to provide sustainable programs. To understand capacity building processes and outcomes, we partnered with a YMCA to build on their adolescent physical activity promotion capacity. Together, we designed and implemented means to evaluate the YMCA teen program to inform program planning. For this qualitative case study, emails and interviews and meetings transcripts were collected over 2.5 years and analyzed using inductive and deductive thematic analysis. Findings illustrate that the YMCA's workforce and organizational development capacities (e.g., evaluation and health promotion capacity and competence) were increased through our partnership, resource allocation, and leadership. We responded to YMCA partners' perceived needs, yet guided them beyond those needs, successfully combining our complementary objectives, knowledge, and skills to generate an integrated program vision, rationale, and evaluation results. This provided YMCA partners with validation, reminders, and awareness. In turn, this contributed to programming and evaluation practice changes. In light of extant capacity building literature, we discuss how our partnership increased the YMCA's capacity to promote healthy adolescent programs.

This article aims to guide organizations implementing MOOCs through a series of steps to assist them in developing a strategy to monitor, improve, and judge the merit of their initiatives. We describe how we operationalise our strategy by first defining the different layers of interacting agents in a given MOOC system. We then tailor our approach to these different layers. Specifically, a two-pronged approach was developed, where we suggest that individual projects be assessed through performance monitoring; assessment criteria for which would be defined at the outset to include coverage, participation, quality and student achievement. In contrast, the success of an overall initiative should be considered within a more adaptive, emergent evaluation inquiry framework. We present the inquiry framework we developed for MOOC initiatives, and show how this framework might be used to develop evaluation questions and an assessment methodology. We also define the more fixed indicators and measures for project performance monitoring. Our strategy is described as it was developed to inform the evaluation of a MOOC initiative at the University of Cape Town (UCT), South Africa.

Systematic planning and evaluation of dissemination efforts can aid translation from experimental trials to larger dissemination programs. The Study of Health and Activity in Preschool Environments (SHAPES) was a group-randomized intervention trial conducted in 16 preschools that successfully increased the physical activity of preschool age children. Following the completion of the research study protocol, the intervention was abbreviated, modified and implemented in four preschools that participated as control preschools in the original research study. The purposes of the current study were to describe the process of refining the intervention for dissemination to the control preschools, and to assess the acceptability of the resulting abbreviated intervention delivery. Five overarching behavioral objectives, informed by process evaluation, data from the original trial and collaboration with intervention teachers, were used to guide the implementation. Teachers in the dissemination classrooms reported high levels of acceptability, potential for sustainability of the program, and positive results in knowledge, skills, and child outcomes. Researchers can include a systematic approach to dissemination of effective intervention elements to the control participants in experimental studies to inform future dissemination efforts and begin to bridge the dissemination gap.

Some of the learning included: relationship building is key for this model of capacity building; community organizations often have had negative experiences with evaluation and the idea that evaluations can be friendly tools in implementing meaningful programs is one key mechanism by which such an initiative can work; community organizations often need evaluation most to be able to demonstrate their value; a strength of this initiative was that the focus was not just on creating products but mostly on developing a learning process in which capacities would remain; evaluation tools and skills that organizations found useful were developing a theory of change and the concept of heterogeneous mechanisms (informed by a realist evaluation lens).

Recent reforms in forensic accounting technology for corporate fraud risk management globally have opened up new avenues for corporate governance and internal control mechanism implementation. This study thus presents an integrated methodology for forensic accounting implementation to improve the identification of the strategy map relationship between the Balanced Scorecard (BSC)-based perspective and criteria, by combining multiple-criteria decision making (MCDM) with the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and the Analytic Network Process (ANP) techniques. The results have implications for corporate decision-makers to effectively fulfil corporate governance quality assurance and anti-fraud through a forensic accounting strategy map illustration. From the evaluation and planning perspective, the in-depth analysis of strategy map is useful to obtain an interrelationship that takes as its starting point the practice professions of the decision maker to improve existing strategy alternatives and focus on the valuable strategy paths. In the evaluation planning application, a strategy map of forensic accounting presents the knowledge regarding key indicators' priorities to achieve satisfactory strategy planning and to practice forensic accounting development linked to fraud risk management in Taiwan.

Preliminary results from Dutch care-PA initiatives for adults with a low socioeconomic status (SES) indicate a decrease in participants' body weight and an improved quality of life, however, the elements that make these initiatives successful are yet to be identified. In total, 19 Dutch health promotion experts participated in our concept mapping (CM) of the effective elements of care-PA initiatives for adults with a low SES. The experts identified 111 effective elements of these initiatives, which were grouped into 11 clusters, focusing on: 1) approaching participants within the care-PA initiative, 2) barriers experienced throughout the initiative, 3) long-term implementation, 4) customizing the care-PA initiative to the target population, 5) social support, 6) structure and guidance, 7) the professionals within the care-PA initiative, 8) the accessibility of the care-PA initiative, 9) targeted behaviour and progression, 10) recruitment and administration, and 11) intersectoral collaboration.

Effective element; Lifestyle intervention; Concept mapping; Health promotion; Value for money: A utilization-focused approach to extending the foundation and contribution of economic evaluation Value for Money (VfM) is an evaluative question about the merit, worth, and significance of resource use in social programs. Although VfM is a critical component of evidence-based programming, it is often overlooked or avoided by evaluators and decision-makers. A framework for evaluating VfM across the dimensions of economy, effectiveness, efficiency, and equity has emerged in response to limitations of traditional economic evaluation. This framework for assessing VfM integrates methods for engaging stakeholders in evaluative thinking to increase acceptance and utilization of evaluations that address questions of resource use. In this review, we synthesize literature on the VfM framework and position it within a broader theory of Utilization-Focused Evaluation (UFE). We then examine mechanisms through which the VfM framework may contribute to increased evaluation use. Finally, we outline avenues for future research on VfM evaluation.

Managing explanatory tensions from different sources of evidence in multi-stakeholder projects can challenge external evaluators, especially when access to pertinent data, like client records, is mediated by program stakeholders. In this article, we consider two central questions: how can program stakeholder motives shape a realist evaluation project; and how might realist evaluators respond to stakeholders' belief-motive explanations, including those about program effectiveness, based on factors such as supererogatory commitment or trying together in good faith? Drawing on our realist evaluation of a service reform initiative involving multiple agencies, we describe stakeholder motives at key phases, highlighting a need for tactics and skills that help to manage explanatory tensions. In conclusion, the relevance of stakeholders' belief-motive explanations ('we believe the program works') in realist evaluation is clarified and discussed.

It sees evidence as essential for managing well, but building such a culture is challenging. Community service organizations seek to provide effective services for their clients. To build an evaluative culture, they need to acquire basic monitoring and evaluation capabilities, be provided with opportunities for using these capabilities and be adequately motivated to care about evidence as a means to improve services to their clients. Leadership along with a phased in approach are key in bringing about these behaviour changes.

It begins with a description of the Evaluation Support Program, emphasizing its key attributes. Next, it raises two points regarding ECB theory: (1) the need to become clearer about the concepts and terms used to describe and study this phenomenon, and (2) the potential value of social science theory to understand ECB and improve its practice. The article concludes with practical ideas for improving ECB: (1) framing it as an educative act, which assigns the evaluator the critical role of evaluation teacher/coach; and (2) the importance of never assuming that an ECB effort begins in unchartered territory, but rather that it builds on people's knowledge, skills, attitudes, and previous experiences.

Quality improvement in Healthcare is the new fashion actually. Rich countries and developing countries alike are trying to implement quality improvement initiatives to improve their performance and the quality of care. There is evidence in the scientific literature that the existence of a \"champion\" can play an important role in the successful implementation of quality improvement strategies. Most of the time, people get stuck at the implementation level: they know what to do but they fail to execute it in the organizational setting. That's where a champion can be useful to facilitate the success of the change. There is a paucity of research on the link between the champion and the implementation of quality improvement programs. The aim of the study was to investigate the perceptions of stakeholders about the characteristics and qualities of the champion that could facilitate the successful implementation of quality improvement programs in health care settings in Haiti.

Recurrence of child maltreatment is a significant concern causing substantial individual, family and societal cost. Variable-based approaches to identifying targets for intervention may not reflect the reality that families may experience multiple co-occurring risks. An alternative approach was tested using baseline data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-being (NSCAW) I and II to develop Latent Class Analysis models of family risk classes using variables derived from prior studies of re-reporting. The samples were collected approximately 10 years apart offering a chance to test how the approach might be impacted by demographic or policy shifts. The association between baseline classes and later re-reports was tested using both samples. A two-class model of high versus low presence of baseline risk resulted that was strongly associated with later likelihood of re-report and results were relatively stable across the two studies. Person-centered approaches may hold promise in the early identification of families that require a more comprehensive array of supports to prevent re-reports of maltreatment.

This paper reflects on that experience. In particular, we identify the key lessons derived from the OBI initiative, discuss how these lessons have informed DWP practice going forward, and highlight what we consider to be the most valuable aspects of the Evaluation Support Program. While we now recognize the need to establish an evaluation culture within DWP, we find that there are significant challenges associated with both building and sustaining evaluation capacity in the context of a small community-based organization. Whereas DWP has built considerable strengths in terms of informal evaluation capacity, on its own, such capacity is insufficient to, for example, demonstrate DWP's impact to outside audiences or successfully scale up the program.

In addition to providing medicines to the entire Internal Unit, it has created a service called \"Hospital Ambulatory Pharmacy\", which allows continued hospital treatments at home, in a more comfortable and familiar environment. This is mostly due uderfunding which has hindered recruitment of health professionals as well a growing concern for the comfort of patients as they convalesce. The Hospital Ambulatory Pharmacy's main problems are both recurring stock-outs and over-stocks; the fact that medicines's delivery routes are not completed, and that medical staff lacks awareness of the techniques to overcome the logistic issues involved. As a methodology, a context analysis was carried out, KPI's were created to quantify the problems and raise health professionals' awareness of what was happening. Solutions for storage were analysed and visits were made to a central hospital to analyse the solutions adopted to solve the same problems. The most appropriate inventory management policies were considered for the organization of existing and further resources. We chose to create an Advanced Warehouse with Level Replenishment. The levels were defined considering the demand of each medicine and divided into three different classes to use the best strategy for each type of demand. Then, and with the help of the LHU IT team, the inventory management module of the information system was parameterized, so stock replenishment could be done electronically. All these changes resulted in a 30 % reduction in stock-out. At the beginning of the study, stock-outs would reach peaks of 6 %. These were reduced to 4.5 % at a point at which professionals were already more aware of the logistic problem, and finally to 1.5 %, in the final phase, at a time when the proposal had already been implemented. Over-stock was reduced by 66 %. Delivery routes were stipulated, and compliance was verified. A novel service developed to increase the well-being of patients monitored at home which it is intended to improve the service provided to the users and at the same time reduce operational costs.

Given the potential influence fellowships have on the future public health workforce, it is important to understand and articulate the results of such programs and to identify areas of improvement to meet current workforce needs. The purpose of this literature review was to identify common practices used to evaluate nonclinical fellowship programs. After a search of the internet and selected databases, we screened titles and abstracts using predetermined selection criteria. We then conducted a detailed review of selected papers to extract information about program characteristics (program description, sector, and program length) and evaluation characteristics (primary evaluation type, framework for evaluation, data collection methods, and respondent populations) from 33 papers. We found a limited number of published papers on the evaluation of nonclinical fellowship programs, and most focused on outcomes associated with fellows or alumni.

Complemented by factor analyses, two-step cluster analysis was applied on 6674 MSBs' management dimensions to identify group patterns and statistical tests explored further cluster differences regarding management and innovation dimensions, besides innovation improvement throughout the program. Results were multifaceted. First, complementary factor analyses showed that management dimensions compose one factor with similar loadings, thus in accordance with their predictive importance found in the cluster analysis. Second, two main clusters were identified in terms of management level, which also presented significant differences regarding innovation levels. Third, considering a before-and-after self-comparison, by and large, innovation was significantly improved by both clusters. Fourth, the highest developed cluster presented higher improvement rates in most innovation dimensions, thus benefiting more from the program, except for two marketing-related innovations, which improved similarly by both clusters. Overall, even though the LIA Program was effective to leverage MSBs innovation, higher efficiency rates would be bounded to fewer participating MSBs, and hence policy planners should be aware of this tradeoff.

This is done by helping community organizations build evaluation capacity and foster the use of evidence to inform their activities and services. Helping organizations to build capacities to track the 'key ingredients' of their successes will help ensure that successes are replicated and services can be improved to maximize the benefit that people receive from them.

In the field of international aid the participatory approaches to assessment, research, management and budgeting have been widely studied and applied in the last decades, mostly because international aid initiatives, in all their relevant phases from planning through implementation, monitoring and evaluation, are faced with the problem of identifying initiatives that could be successfully and sustainably implemented. The present paper investigates the use of a modified form of analytic hierarchy process, namely the participatory analytic hierarchy process, as a tool for choice criteria elicitation and resource allocation in the framework of an operational planning for agricultural development projects in the Dioceses of Goma, Nord Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo. During our research, we were able to make use of most frequent inconsistencies in pairwise comparison matrixes in order to stimulate the debate, to adjust local preferences and to build consensus across the group. From an operational point of view, the PAHP methodology was also suited for training the project team and for identifying a shared resource allocation pattern, which matches the existing international guidelines for agricultural development in the region.

However, most of the existing studies on TOD emphasize the economic and environmental perspectives of sustainability, paying little attention to social equity. Moreover, despite governments worldwide are gradually trying to address unsustainable issues associated with dramatic urbanization through a framework of TOD development, the improvement of land use planning necessary to achieve variegated sustainability within a safe trajectory is not being targeted or achieved. This paper aims to establish a framework of TOD planning in China's context that could be applied beyond the concept to planning experts and policymakers on how to integrate land use planning with TOD to achieve sustainability. We further applied an empirical study of Jiaomei, China to demonstrate the application of the designed framework. The study provided a new framework for understanding sustainable transportation development with land use management as applied to the urban planning process and for exploring new paths in practice toward sustainability.

The complexity associated with the running of these programmes and the resources committed make their quality assessment essential. The aim of the current paper is to validate and refine the use of the EFQM model in this context. A programme of a medium-sized municipality of the Centre region of Portugal was used as a case study to evaluate the adequacy and relevance of the EFQM model and to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the current programme based on the data collected from service users, instructors, municipal leaders and programme partners. High levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty, together with the clarity of programme mission and strategy emerged as main areas of strength. On the other hand, insufficient attention to the measurement of people satisfaction, as well as the leaders' failure of to show appreciation for the efforts developed by the programme instructors are key areas for improvement.

Evaluation of a Canadian poverty reduction initiative Program evaluation is an important aspect of any organization. The ability to reflect on past performance and plan for the future is essential to an organization's health and future growth. This exploratory study is part of a larger program evaluation initiative that examined the efficacy of a regionally based organization that provided funding to community groups to alleviate poverty. The purpose of the study was to explore testimonials provided by participants of the organization's funded programs, to determine if the participants were satisfied with the programs and the extent to which participants' perceptions are congruent with the goals of the organization. Content analysis was used to examine 3494 testimonials from 77 different agencies. Three overall themes were determined from the analysis: 1 Developing Social Networks, 2 Learning Comes in Various Forms, and 3 Developing Self-Efficacy. Findings from the testimonials suggest that the benefits of the programs are highly social and that connections with others are important, but also provide rich opportunities for learning new skills and knowledge, as well as gaining confidence and a sense of control. The findings from this analysis support one goal of the organization which is to engage people living in poverty in meaningful ways.

It describes challenges and opportunities of building evaluation capacity among community-based organizations in Ontario involved in enhancing brain health and supporting people living with a brain disorder. Using an example of a capacity building program called the \"Evaluation Support Program\", which is run by the Ontario Brain Institute, this forum discusses multiple themes including evaluation capacity building, evaluation culture and evaluation methodologies appropriate for evaluating complex community interventions. The goal of the Evaluation Support Program is to help community-based organizations build the capacity to demonstrate the value that they offer in order to improve, sustain, and spread their programs and activities. One of the features of this forum is that perspectives on the Evaluation Support Program are provided by multiple stakeholders, including the community-based organizations, evaluation team members involved in capacity building, thought leaders in the fields of evaluation capacity building and evaluation culture, and the funders.

Implementation of Quality Management Systems (QMS) has increased greatly in recent years at a wide variety of institutions. The main purpose of this work is to evaluate and compare the impact of having implemented ISO:9001 standards and the EFQM model on the communication system and external relations at schools. This was done by applying a validated evaluation instrument to 2901 subjects of 116 schools in 4 Spanish Autonomous Communities. The results show that the QMS have a medium-high level of impact on the communication system and a moderate level on the external relations dimension. Furthermore, schools with EFQM feature significantly higher levels of impact on the dimensions studied than schools implementing ISO standards. Significant differences were found in the levels of impact as a function of the number of years of implementation and the type of funding received, among other variables. In addition, an interaction effect was found between the type and size of schools in regard to their external relations.

The objectives of this study were to identify stake-holders who have a role to play in childhood diarrhea management, to identify gaps in childhood diarrhea management and to propose strategic options for relieving these gaps. Bottleneck analysis exercise was carried out based on the Tanahashi model in six High Priority Districts (HPDs) of Gujarat in period between July-November 2013. The major bottlenecks identified for Childhood Diarrhea management were poor demand generation, unsafe drinking water, poor access to improved sanitation facility and lack of equitable distribution and replenishment mechanisms for Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) packets and Zinc tablets till the front-line worker level. The main strategic options that were suggested for relieving these bottlenecks were Zinc-ORS roll out in scale-up districts, develop Information Education Communication/Behaviour Change Communication (IEC/BCC) plan for childhood diarrhea management at state/district level, use of Drug Logistics Information Management System (DLIMS) software for supply chain management of Zinc-ORS, strengthening of chlorination activity at household level, monitoring implementation of Nirmal Bharat Abhiyaan (NBA) for constructing improved sanitation facilities at household level and to develop an IEC/BCC plan for hygiene promotion and usage of sanitary latrines. Use of Zinc tablets need to be intensified through an effective scale-up. Adequate demand generation activity is needed. There is need to address safe drinking water and improved sanitation measures at household levels. Multi-sectoral engagements and ownership of Zinc-ORS program is the need of the hour. Bottleneck analysis; model; Childhood towards incorporating heterogeneities into program theory: A case study of a data-driven approach This paper describes a framework that can help refine program theory through data explorations and stakeholder dialogue. The framework incorporates the following steps: a recognition that program implementation might need to be multi-phased for a number of interventions, the need to take stock of program theory, the application of pattern recognition methods to help identify heterogeneous program mechanisms, and stakeholder dialogue to refine the program. As part of the data exploration, a method known as developmental trajectories is implemented to learn about heterogeneous trajectories of outcomes in longitudinal evaluations. This method identifies trajectory clusters and also can estimate different treatment impacts for the various groups. The framework is highlighted with data collected in an evaluation of an alcohol risk-reduction program delivered in a college fraternity setting. The framework discussed in the paper is informed by a realist focus on \"what works for whom under what contexts.\" The utility of the framework in contributing to a dialogue on heterogeneous mechanism and subsequent implementation is described. The connection of the ideas in paper to a 'learning through principled discovery' approach is also described.

Finally, the utility interval technique is applied to combine the ranking results of MCDM methods. Weighted utility intervals are computed by constructing a correlation matrix between the ranking methods. A real case is presented to show the efficacy of the proposed approach.

However, how and to what extent kindness education programming influences positive outcomes in schools is poorly understood, and such programs are difficult to evaluate in the absence of a conceptual model for studying their effectiveness. In partnership with Kind Campus, a widely adopted school-based kindness education program that uses a bottom-up program framework, a methodology called concept mapping was used to develop a conceptual model for evaluating school-based kindness education programs from the input of 123 middle school students and approximately 150 educators, school professionals, and academic scholars. From the basis of this model, recommendations for processes and outcomes that would be useful to assess in evaluations of kindness education programs are made, and areas where additional instrument development may be necessary are highlighted. The utility of the concept mapping method as an initial step in evaluating other grassroots or non-traditional educational programming is also discussed. 58 160 170 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149718915301130 Kaplan, Deanna M. deBlois, Madeleine Dominguez, Violeta Walsh, Michele E. oai:RePEc:eee:epplan:v:58:y:2016:i:c:p:98-1052020-06-08RePEc:eee:epplan article Lessons learnt from the CERCA Project, a multicomponent intervention to promote adolescent sexual and reproductive health in three Latin America countries: a qualitative post-hoc evaluation The Community-Embedded Reproductive Health Care for Adolescents (CERCA) Project was implemented in Bolivia, Ecuador and Nicaragua (2011-2014) to test the effectiveness of interventions preventing teenage pregnancies. As the outcome evaluation showed limited impact, a post-hoc process evaluation was carried out to determine if and how CERCA's design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation affected the results.

However, few teens experience formal education about the knowledge and skills necessary for building healthy romantic relationships. In response, a statewide relationship education initiative was developed at a large university in a Southeastern state. Undergraduates who enrolled in a service learning course in Human Development and Family Studies partnered with this initiative and implemented a relationship education program targeting high school students. A service learning model is used in this initiative because it offers opportunities for students' professional development and experiential learning. The present article provides a formative and illustrative summative evaluation of the service learning program. Specifically, the primary aims of this paper are to 1) provide an overview of the service learning course components; 2) describe preparation of the service learning students and their implementation of the relationship education program; 3) discuss challenges and lessons learned; and 4) offer initial evidence of effectiveness by showing change in targeted outcomes for the high school student recipients of the relationship education program.

The objectives of this study were to identify evaluated strategies used by organizations and program developers to build the program evaluation capacity of their workforce, and to describe success factors and lessons learned. Common elements for successful evaluation capacity building (ECB) include: a tailored strategy based on needs assessment, an organizational commitment to evaluation and ECB, experiential learning, training with a practical element, and some form of ongoing technical support within the workplace. ECB is a relatively new field of endeavor, and, while existing studies in ECB are characterized by lower levels of evidence, they suggest the most successful approaches to ECB are likely to be multifaceted. To build the level of evidence in this field, more rigorous study designs need to be implemented in the future.

Participants were 954 medical students: 481 from the University of Extremadura (Spain) and 473 from the University of Lisbon (Portugal). Following Messicks' validation framework, we analyzed the scale's response process, internal structure and relationship with other variables (i.e., engagement). Descriptive statistics, scale reliability, item characteristics, and exploratory and confirmatory analyses supported the distribution of the sixteen items across four factors. Convergent validity analyzed through the vc () index showed that all the factors were in the 50% criterion. The factors shared, on average, 23% of the variance showing adequate discriminant validity. Furthermore, the correlations among EI dimensions and engagement were all positive and significant. Overall, the WLEIS demonstrated good psychometric properties. Thus, this study ensures that WLEIS is a valid instrument in Portugal and Spain to evaluate EI in medical students.

Measurement of achievement or progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) should be suggestive of the issues involved in intertemporal comparison. Commonly, we observe that the measurement techniques such as simple differentials, rates and ratios are employed for comparisons and interpretations. But such chosen measures are insensitive to two very important and fundamental concerns. Firstly, such measures are not differentially sensitive to the base level of the indicator against which comparisons are made to comment on the progress or achievement. Secondly, it is observed that in most of the progress assessments and comparisons, without exception, the focus is on population averages thus ignoring the inherent inequalities therein. To incorporate these two concerns, a method is proposed and an illustrative application is provided to review the MDG achievements in child health across 32 developing countries. The adopted technique is effective for comparison and interpretation of progress and achievement as it augments the principles of equity as well as base-level sensitivity. More importantly, such an improved measure could help the policymakers to identify achievements in a more realistic manner and thus develop a comprehensive vision regarding social and economic achievements.

The AC is a body comprising representatives of all stakeholder groups involved in the programme. During the 2013-2014 academic year the programme's AC met four times, operating as a communicative focus group (CFG). The meetings focused on: (1) excluding dimensions (barriers preventing transformation) and transforming dimensions (ways of overcoming barriers), (2) the programme's strengths, (3) the programme's weaknesses and specific actions to remedy them, and (4) the resulting conclusions which were then incorporated into the subsequent programme contract signed between the University and the Segovia Local Authority for 2014-2018. The key conclusions were: (1) the recommendations of the AC widen the range of perspectives and help the research team to make key decisions and (2) the use of CM to fully evaluate the programme and to reach a consensus on how to improve it proved very valuable.

The focus of this study is on the effects of the CQIWP on municipal investment and physical conditions of drinking water systems and, as such, it goes beyond the usual emphasis on the fiscal consequences of intergovernmental grants. The study results show that the CQIWP was an efficient tool to induce municipalities to increase investment and to reduce the number of aqueduct breakdowns. In light of these findings, this study suggests that upper levels of governments can rely on infrastructure grants to fill the gap in municipal investment and, therefore, to improve the availability and quality of municipal infrastructure.

Agencies that accredit institutions and programs require evidence of program quality, including student satisfaction. A large state university in the Southeastern United States transitioned an online nursing education degree completion, or Registered Nurse-to-Bachelor of Science in Nursing, program to an online accelerated format in order to meet the needs of working nurses and ultimately, increase the number of nurses prepared at the baccalaureate level. This article describes a descriptive, cross-sectional study that evaluated the effectiveness of the new online accelerated program using the quality indicator of student satisfaction. Ninety-one (32%) of the 284 students who were enrolled or had been enrolled in a course within the online accelerated degree completion program between fall 2013 session 1 and summer 2014 session participated in the study. The electronic Noel-Levitz Priorities Survey for Online Learners was used to measure student satisfaction with the program and associated services. Results provided insight into the students' satisfaction with the new program format and served as the basis for an interdepartmental program enhancement plan aimed at maintaining and enhancing student satisfaction and overall program quality. Findings indicated that measuring and evaluating student satisfaction can provide valuable information about the effectiveness of an online program. Recommendations for using the measurement tool in online program planning and studying student satisfaction in relation to retention and program completion were identified.

However, little work has examined whether this modality of treatment is well-received by patients and results in clinical improvements. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate patient satisfaction and outcomes for group-based programming offered through an adult eating disorders clinic. Participants were 81 adults who met DSM-5 criteria for an eating disorder and participated in the study as part of the clinic's program evaluation. Participants received medical monitoring, psychiatric follow-up, adjunct nutrition and pre-psychological treatment, and participated in the clinic's core cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) group. Demographic information and weight were collected at intake. Participants also completed pre- and post-group programming measures of life satisfaction, depressive and anxiety symptoms, psychological symptoms of the eating disorder, and satisfaction with the programming. Participants' experienced a significant increase in satisfaction with life, and decreases in depressive symptoms and psychological symptoms of the eating disorder post-group. Adults endorsed feeling fairly satisfied with the group-based services provided. Results draw attention to the importance of program evaluation as an integral component of an adult outpatient eating disorder clinic by providing a voice for patients' views of the services received and program outcomes.

Although social support is a frequently cited enabler of physical activity, few studies have examined how to harness social support in interventions. This paper describes community-based formative research to design a walking program for mobilizing naturally occurring social networks to support increases in walking behavior. Focus group methods were used to engage community members in discussions about desired walking program features. The research was conducted with underserved communities in Sumter County, South Carolina. The majority of focus group participants were women (76%) and African American (92%). Several important themes emerged from the focus group results regarding attitudes toward walking, facilitators of and barriers to walking, ideal walking program characteristics, and strategies for encouraging community members to walk. Most noteably, the role of existing social networks as a supportive influence on physical activity was a recurring theme in our formative research and a gap in the existing evidence base. The resulting walking program focused on strategies for mobilizing, supporting and reinforcing existing social networks as mechanisms for increasing walking. Our approach to linking theory, empirical evidence and community-based formative research for the development of a walking intervention offers an example for practitioners developing intervention strategies for a wide range of behaviors.

The evaluation team used seven distinct, evaluation strategies to obtain evaluation data from the first Community Health Improvement Leadership Academy (CHILA) within a three-prong framework (inquiry, observation, and reflection). These methods included: comprehensive survey, rapid feedback form, learning wall, observational form, team debrief, social network analysis and critical moments reflection. The seven distinct methods allowed for both real time quality improvement during the CHILA and long term planning for the next CHILA. The methods also gave a comprehensive picture of the CHILA, which when synthesized allowed the evaluation team to assess the effectiveness of a training designed to tap into natural community strengths and accelerate health improvement. We hope that these formative evaluation methods can continue to be refined and used by others to evaluate training.

A small formative evaluation included a limited number of interviews with program participants during the first year of program implementation (n=10), a retrospective case file review (n=17) of closed cases following the first three years of implementation, and notes from ongoing meetings and discussion with program staff. Findings regarding client engagement, long-term interaction between risk and services, and program refinement are discussed. Despite the program's voluntary nature, positive comments from families, and extensive engagement strategies, only about 22% of families remained engaged for the full two-year program. Material hardship was one of the most persistent risk factors from baseline to termination. In many cases, unforeseen negative events occurred that, at least partly, derailed progress. In all cases, progress made was not reflective of a consistent linear process used in the design of most child welfare programs. Implications for program theory and design are discussed.

It can appeal to youth-at-risk who are often less responsive to traditional psychotherapeutic interventions. This study evaluated Wilderness Adventure Therapy (WAT) outcomes based on participants' pre-program, post-program, and follow-up responses to self-report questionnaires. The sample consisted of 36 adolescent out-patients with mixed mental health issues who completed a 10-week, manualised WAT intervention. The overall short-term standardised mean effect size was small, positive, and statistically significant (0.26), with moderate, statistically significant improvements in psychological resilience and social self-esteem. Total short-term effects were within age-based adventure therapy meta-analytic benchmark 90% confidence intervals, except for the change in suicidality which was lower than the comparable benchmark. The short-term changes were retained at the three-month follow-up, except for family functioning (significant reduction) and suicidality (significant improvement). For participants in clinical ranges pre-program, there was a large, statistically significant reduction in depressive symptomology, and large to very large, statistically significant improvements in behavioural and emotional functioning. These changes were retained at the three-month follow-up. These findings indicate that WAT is as effective as traditional psychotherapy techniques for clinically symptomatic people. Future research utilising a comparison or wait-list control group, multiple sources of data, and a larger sample, could help to qualify and extend these findings.

This paper describes efforts, over three years, to improve in-service training for counsellors positioned at DSRCs\u2014using a data approach. The programme managers realised, through rigorous monitoring of initial induction training reports that, while knowledge and attitudes of most trainees had improved as evident from t-tests, at least one-quarter scored worse on post-training assessments (n=859). Therefore, they undertook a survey using a competency approach to diagnose what critical competencies are influenced through training: counselling skills, risk reduction suggestions, labelling male and female anatomy, record-keeping and STI patient education (n=132). Survey results demonstrated that trainees failed to pass a two-thirds cutoff score in most competencies. These findings led the programme managers to modify training and implement tighter quality measures. In the second round of training - refresher training - outcomes on competency assessments before and after training showed more acceptable performance (n=833). The paper describes how programme managers, after an acceptance of such initial short-comings, developed customized assessments when literature provided limited guidance and how they worked to achieve change that was acceptable for programme needs.

Evaluators conducted qualitative telephone interviews with 36 respondents (19 practitioners and 17 managers) who participated in the AIDES initiative trial. Respondents were chosen to include all participating organisations (child protection services, prevention social services). Participants' comments were submitted to descriptive content analysis. Conditions facilitating or hindering implementation of the initiative included the following dimensions: (1) implementation quality; (2) organisational elements (organisational functioning, cooperation between organisations); (3) socio-political issues; and (4) personal and professional characteristics. The study highlights critical elements to consider in implementing and maintaining significant changes in practice in organisations providing assistance to vulnerable children and their families. Social innovations that do not consider such elements are likely to compromise their implementation and sustainability.

This article draws upon ecosystem services theory to develop a framework to guide the M&E of collaborative environmental programs with anticipated social benefits. The framework has six components: program need, program activities, pathway process variables, moderating process variables, outcomes, and program value. Needs are defined in terms of ecosystem services, as well as other human needs that must be addressed to achieve outcomes. The pathway variable relates to the development of natural resource governance capacity in the target community. Moderating processes can be externalities such as the inherent capacity of the natural system to service ecosystem needs, local demand for natural resources, policy or socio-economic drivers. Internal program-specific processes relate to program service delivery, targeting and participant responsiveness. Ecological outcomes are expressed in terms of changes in landscape structure and function, which in turn influence ecosystem service provision. Social benefits derived from the program are expressed in terms of the value of the eco-social service to user-specified goals. The article provides suggestions from the literature for identifying indicators and measures for components and component variables, and concludes with an example of how the framework was used to inform the M&E of an adaptive co-management program in western Kenya.

However, there is no rigorous evidence as to either the best methods for, or feasibility of, incorporating the sibling link within existing clinical treatments for foster youth. This paper applies the literature on evidence-based practices (EBP) and implementation research in child welfare to sibling-focused intervention; and presents data concerning the development, delivery, cost, and feasibility of a novel sibling-focused intervention program, Supporting Siblings in Foster Care (SIBS-FC). Results suggest that despite the challenges and costs involved with delivering SIBS-FC, the program catered to the diverse needs of pre-adolescent and adolescent siblings living together and apart, was viewed positively by youth, and was implemented with a high degree of fidelity. These findings underscore the importance of attending to the early-stage development of psychosocial interventions in child welfare and highlight the role of interagency collaboration, program planning, staff training and supervision, and fidelity tracking for EBP development in child welfare.

This study takes the challenge by introducing an innovative evaluation approach, named the exhibited generalization approach, and applying it in evaluating the carbon monoxide (CO) alarm ordinance passed by Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. The stakeholders specifically asked evaluators to determine the answers to the following two questions: (1) Does the alarm ordinance work? (2) What generalizable information can the Mecklenburg experience provide to other jurisdictions trying to decide if the alarm ordinance's planning, implementation, adoption, and outcomes are transferable to their communities? This study illustrates how to apply the exhibited generalization approach to provide the stakeholders with answers to these questions. Our results indicate that the alarm ordinance was effective in increasing CO alarm ownerships and reducing CO poisoning cases. The evaluation provides potential users and other interested parties with the necessary information on contextual factors and the causal mechanism underlying the CO alarm ordinance, so that these parties and users could decide whether the Mecklenburg alarm ordinance would be transferable to their own communities. Discussions include implications of this study for contributing in further advancing evaluation theory in addressing transferability or external validity issues.

Results indicate that the intervention was successfully implemented in all birthing hospitals (n=86) across the state with a high degree of fidelity. Furthermore, the majority of the hospitals reported incorporating the program into unit procedures and employee training.

This is particularly relevant given the rise in rigorous impact evaluations that use cluster randomized designs across various fields including education, public health and social welfare. Using data from a recently completed cluster RCT of a school-based teacher professional development program, we demonstrate our use of four commonly applied methods for analyzing clustered data. These methods include: (1) hierarchical linear modeling (HLM); (2) feasible generalized least squares (FGLS); (3) generalized estimating equations (GEE); and (4) ordinary least squares (OLS) regression with cluster-robust (Huber-White) standard errors. We compare our findings across each method, showing how inconsistent results - in terms of both effect sizes and statistical significance - emerged across each method and our analytic approach to resolving such inconsistencies.

The contextual factors themselves, surrounding health professions' practices, also adapt as practices become sustained. The authors assert the need for better planning models toward these contextual factors, the influence of which undergird a well-documented science to practice gap in literature on EBPs. The mechanism for EBP planners to anticipate contextual effects as programs Unfreeze their host settings, create Movement, and become Refrozen (Lewin, 1951) is present in Lewin's 3-step change model. Planning for contextual change appears equally important as planning for the actual practice outcomes among providers and patients. Two case studies from a Geriatric Education Center network will illustrate the synthesis of Lewin's three steps with collaborative evaluation principles. The use of the model may become an important tool for continuing education evaluators or organizations beginning a journey toward EBP demonstration projects in clinical settings.

The strategy consists of four components: (1) planned action in the form of the behavioral contract and caregiver OH action planning; (2) capacity building through didactic and observation learning training; (3) environmental adaptations consisting of additional oral heath devices and strategies to create a calm atmosphere; and (4) reinforcement by post-training coaching. A pilot study was conducted consisting of pre- and post-assessment data collected 1 week before and 1 week after implementing a 1-month OH strategy. The study sample comprised 11 group homes with 21 caregivers and 25 residents with IDD from one service organization in a Midwestern city. A process evaluation found high-quality implementation of the OH strategy as measured by dosage, fidelity, and caregiver reactions to implementing the strategy. Using repeated cross-sectional and repeated measures analyses, we found statistically significant positive changes in OH status and oral hygiene practices of residents. Caregiver self-efficacy as a mechanism of change was not adequately evaluated; however, positive change was found in some but not all types of caregiver OH support that were assessed. Lessons learned from implementing the pilot study intervention and evaluation are discussed, as are the next steps in conducting an efficacy study of the OH strategy.

The maps and additional graphics are useful for planning, evaluation and theory development. Group concept maps are typically described, interpreted and utilized through points, clusters and distances, and the implications of these features in understanding how constructs relate to one another. This paper focuses on the application of network analysis to group concept mapping to quantify the strength and directionality of relationships among clusters. The authors outline the steps of this analysis, and illustrate its practical use through an organizational strategic planning example. Additional benefits of this analysis to evaluation projects are also discussed, supporting the overall utility of this supplemental technique to the standard concept mapping methodology.

This paper explores this issue by putting forward an appropriate evaluation methodology for development interventions in rural China. It draws on the experience of an impact evaluation of a sustainable agricultural biodiversity management project conducted in Hainan, China in 2010. The authors propose that evaluation be culturally responsive and the evaluation design be rooted in the particular cultural context where an evaluation is conducted. The appropriate use of the participatory rural appraisal (PRA) approach and methods helps generate data that are relevant and meaningful for evaluation purposes in rural China.

However, optimal conditions for implementing peer-led health promotion programs (HPPs) remain unclear. This scoping review aimed to describe factors that can influence implementation of peer-led HPPs targeting adult populations. Five databases were searched using the keywords \"health promotion/prevention\", \"implementation\", \"peers\", and related terms. Studies were included if they reported at least one factor associated with the implementation of community-based peer-led HPPs. Fifty-five studies were selected for the analysis. The method known as \"best fit framework synthesis\" was used to analyze the factors identified in the selected papers. Many factors included in existing implementation conceptual frameworks were deemed applicable to peer-led HPPs. However, other factors related to individuals, programs, and implementation context also emerged from the analysis. Based on this synthesis, an adapted theoretical framework was elaborated, grounded in a complex adaptive system perspective and specifying potential mechanisms through which factors may influence implementation of community-based peer-led HPPs. Further research is needed to test the theoretical framework against empirical data. Findings from this scoping review increase our knowledge of the optimal conditions for implementing peer-led HPPs and thereby maximizing the benefits of such programs.

There are numerous school dropout prevention programs. However, few of them have undergone a rigorous implementation evaluation to understand their effects. This research presents two studies that evaluated the intervention fidelity and differential effects of Check & Connect (C&C), a targeted school dropout prevention program aimed at promoting student engagement and achievement. A total of 145 elementary school students (Study 1) and 200 secondary school students (Study 2) from two French-Canadian school boards (regional districts grouping elementary and secondary schools) received the C&C intervention for two years. In both studies, a clinical monitoring form was used to compare the intervention fidelity of each program component and active ingredient with what was initially planned. The relation between intervention fidelity and the effects of C&C on student engagement and achievement was analyzed using multiple linear regressions. Overall, the results show that intervention fidelity varies across elementary and secondary schools from one component to another and from one site to another. Furthermore, the association between the fidelity of each component and positive outcomes varies, depending on the implementation site. This evaluation supports the relevance of every component of C&C to favor engagement and academic achievement among at-risk elementary and secondary school students, while suggesting that the importance of certain program components may vary, depending on contextual influences on implementation and outcomes.

Our results show that in keeping with policy requirements, the evaluation recommendations focused on program relevance, effectiveness and efficiency and economy. Furthermore, a significant number of recommendations also focused on the implementation of more rigorous performance measurement strategies. The focus of the recommendations did not vary by publication date, recommendation type, and organizational sector. The findings also show that for the most part, the management responses produced as part of the broader evaluation process support the recommendations included in the report and identify specific timelines for implementation.

Multi-level, evidence-based fall prevention programs have been promoted by the CDC and other government agencies. To ensure participants and communities receive programs' intended benefits, organizations must repeatedly deliver the programs over time and plan for program sustainability as part of 'scaling up' the initiative. The State Falls Prevention Project (SFPP) began in 2011 when the CDC provided 5 years of funding to State Departments of Health in Colorado, New York, and Oregon to simultaneously implement four fall prevention strategies: 1) Tai Chi: Moving for Better Balance; 2) Stepping On; 3) Otago Exercise Program; and 4) STEADI (STopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries) toolkit. Surveys were performed to examine systems change and perceptions about sustainability across states. The purposes of this study were to: 1) examine how funding influenced the capacity for program implementation and sustainability within the SFPP; and 2) assess reported Program Sustainability Assessment Tool (PSAT) scores to learn about how best to sustain fall preventing efforts after funding ends. Data showed that more organizations offered evidence-based fall prevention programs in participants' service areas with funding, and the importance of programming implementation, evaluation, and reporting efforts were likely to diminish once funding concluded. Participants' reported PSAT scores about perceived sustainability capacity did not directly align with previously reported perceptions about PSAT domain importance or modifiability. Findings suggest the importance of grantees to identify potential barriers and enablers influencing program sustainability during the planning phase of the programs.

Evidence from Western settings suggests that family-centred prevention interventions may be associated with greater reductions in risk behaviour than standard adolescent-only models. Despite this, family-centred models for adolescent HIV prevention are nearly non-existent in South Africa home to more people living with HIV than any other country. This paper describes the development and formative evaluation of one such intervention: an evidence-informed, locally relevant, adolescent prevention intervention engaging caregivers as co-participants. The programme, originally consisting of 19 sessions for caregivers and 14 for adolescents, was piloted with 12 groups of caregiver-adolescent dyads by community-based organizations (CBOs) in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng provinces. Literature and expert reviews were employed in the development process, and evaluation methods included analysis of attendance records, session-level fidelity checklists and facilitator feedback forms collected during the programme pilot. Facilitator focus group discussions and an implementer programme workshop were also held. Results highlighted the need to enhance training content related to cognitive behavioural theory and group management techniques, as well as increase the cultural relevance of activities in the curriculum. Participant attendance challenges were also identified, leading to a shortened and simplified session set. Findings overall were used to finalize materials and guidance for a revised 14-week group programme consisting of individual and joint sessions for adolescents and their caregivers, which may be implemented by community-based facilitators in other settings.

The need to address the crucial question of causal inferences in EMI programs to produce credible evidences of successful interventions contrasts, however, with the absence of experimental or quasi-experimental research and evaluation designs in the field. CIE approach is emerging as a methodologically viable solution to bridge that gap. The program evaluated here consisted in delivering an EMI program in a Primary Education Teacher Training Degree group. After achieving balance on the observed covariates and recreating a situation that would have been expected in a randomized experiment, three matching approaches such as genetic matching, nearest neighbor matching and Coarsened Exact Matching were used to analyze observational data from a total of 1288 undergraduate students, including both treatment and control group. Results show unfavorable effects of the bilingual group treatment condition. Potential interpretations and recommendations are provided in order to strengthen future causal evidences of bilingual education programs' effectiveness in Higher Education.

Conceptually, the ECOQ examines the role of evaluation in organizational development and, most notably in organizational learning. In this model, evaluation capacity building (ECB) initiatives are assumed to contribute to the development of a culture of systematic self-assessment and reflection, which, in turn, leads to increased organizational learning. Our sample consisted of internal evaluators within the federal, provincial or municipal government, not-for-profit organizations, private firms, and colleges or universities in Canada. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and latent path analysis (LPA) were conducted to better understand the underlying structural aspect of the organizational capacity to do and use evaluation construct as measured by the ECOQ. The results of our study indicate that the ECOQ effectively assesses an organization's capacity to do and use evaluation. Furthermore, evidence provided by the LPA statistical analysis suggests that an organization's capacity to learn is enhanced by the relationships among the various factors. Implications of using a validated model of an organization's capacity to do and use evaluations in both research and practice are discussed.

Youth are also at risk of disengaging from services at times of referral to additional or alternative services. This study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators for inter-service referrals for homeless youth with mental health issues who have already engaged with a service. Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with homeless youth (n = 10), homelessness support workers (n = 10), and mental health clinicians (n = 10). Barriers included: resource shortages; programs or services having inflexible entry criteria; complexity of service systems; homeless youth feeling devalued; and a lack of communication between services, for example, abrupt referrals with no follow up. Referral facilitators included: services providers offering friendly and client-centred support; supported referrals; awareness of other services; and collaboration between services. Relationships with service providers and inter-service collaboration appeared essential for successful referrals for homeless youth. These facilitating factors may be undermined by sector separation and siloing, as well as resource shortages in both the homelessness and mental health sectors. Service transitions may be conceptualised as a genuine service outcome for homeless youth, and as a basis for successful future service provision.

Aid is said to weaken domestic accountability, sustain authoritarian regimes, increase political instability, weaken government capacities, and increase corruption. Conducting a systematic search in Web of Science, this paper reviews the empirical evidence for these unintended aggregate effects of aid on the political, administrative, and judicial dimensions of good governance. It finds that the negative effects of aid on governance are much exaggerated. The aggregate effect of aid on democracy has become more positive after the Cold War, and the effect of aid on government capacity and on reducing corruption has also improved over time. Furthermore, most studies show a positive effect of aid on political stability. These findings imply that donor intentions matter: donors that are serious about their intended effects on governance are able to mitigate the possible negative unintended effects of their aid.

While each country implemented a unique introduction strategy, all agreed to track a set of uniform indicators to chart the effect of introducing this new method across settings. Existing national health information systems (HIS) were unable to track new methods or delivery channels introduced for a pilot, thus were not a feasible source for project data. We successfully monitored the four-country pilot introductions by implementing a four-phase approach: 1) developing and defining global indicators, 2) integrating indicators into existing country data collection tools, 3) facilitating consistent reporting and data management, and 4) analyzing and interpreting data and sharing results. Project partners leveraged existing family planning registers to the extent possible, and introduced new or modified data collection and reporting tools to generate project-specific data where necessary. We routinely shared monitoring results with global and national stakeholders, informing decisions about future investments in the product and scale up of DMPA-SC nationwide.

We engaged in an iterative process to culturally adapt a cognitive-behavioral intervention for delivery within a South African primary care clinic. This process involved three phases: (a) preliminary intervention development, drawing on content from a prior evidence-based intervention; (b) contextual adaptation of the curriculum through formative data collection using a multi-method qualitative approach; and (c) pre-testing of trauma screening procedures and a subsequent trial run of the intervention. Feedback from key informant interviews and patient in-depth interviews guided the refinement of session content and adaptation of key intervention elements, including culturally relevant visuals, metaphors, and interactive exercises. The trial run curriculum consisted of four individual sessions and two group sessions. Strong session attendance during the trial run supported the feasibility of ImpACT. Participants responded positively to the logistics of the intervention delivery and the majority of session content. Trial run feedback helped to further refine intervention content and delivery towards a pilot randomized clinical trial to assess the feasibility and potential efficacy of this intervention.

The sample included 118 articles published in six leading higher education evaluation journals from 2003 to 2012. Mixed methods approaches were used to identify key credibility techniques reported across the articles, document the frequency of these techniques, and describe their use and properties. Two broad sets of techniques were of interest: primary design techniques (i.e., basic), such as sampling/participant recruitment strategies, data collection methods, analytic details, and additional qualitative credibility techniques (e.g., member checking, negative case analyses, peer debriefing). The majority of evaluation articles reported use of primary techniques although there was wide variation in the amount of supporting detail; most of the articles did not describe the use of additional credibility techniques. This suggests that editors of evaluation journals should encourage the reporting of qualitative design details and authors should develop strategies yielding fuller methodological description.

The training plan and evaluation for normal schools Normal schools in Mexico train teachers for basic level education. Classified as Higher Education Institutions, part of their mandate is to conduct scientific research to improve educational quality. Currently, normal school students can meet graduation requirements by either writing a thesis or reporting on professional practice using Participatory Action Research (PAR). Teachers at normal schools have only limited experience in conducting and supervising PAR projects. With the aim of analyzing the situation and addressing this paradox, we used PAR to develop a plan to train normal school teachers in application of PAR methodology. We present the training proposal and evaluate its results in a pilot phase. These suggest that PAR represents an innovative option for training teachers to conduct research and therefore fulfill part of their responsibilities at normal schools in Mexico. Changes in institutional culture and structure would be required for successful implementation of PAR in this context.

Programmes focusing on women, youth, and radio were most effective at identifying and explaining unintended effects, likely because the project design guided broader lines of questioning from the beginning. The paper argues that OECD-DAC guidelines are not enough on their own to guide evaluators into exploration of unintended effects, and teams instead need to work together to decide where, when and how they will look for them. Different approaches were also used to capture positive and negative outcomes, suggesting that evaluators need to decide at what level they are evaluating and how to tie effects back to the project's contribution. This study explores evaluation techniques and approaches used to understand impact in complex contexts in the peacebuilding field, and draws on lessons learned for the benefit of other fields dealing with similar complexities in international development and cooperation among actors.

Based on preliminary studies and previous research, Life Writing is expected to foster earned-secure attachment in adults who work through subjective memories of unresolved attachment trauma. Roughly two decades of research on integrative reminiscence interventions like Life Writing show their consistent and wide-ranging positive impact. However, the bulk of this research demonstrates that such programs work, without also clarifying how they work, leaving unanswered questions as to how change occurs and how benefits might continue to accrue to participants through the lifespan. This represents what are known as \"black box\" effects. A program and evaluation planning tool, The Netway, was used to 1) identify hypothesized links between program inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes, and long-term impacts; 2) to clarify the underlying assumptions related to the program's success; and 3) to consider the appropriate contexts for the program. The logic model presented here articulates the hypothesized causal pathway from insecure to earned-secure attachment, in preparation for rigorous empirical tests of the program's lifespan theory of change.

It describes and discusses recent policy trends that move away from emphasizing developing country benefits toward the pursuit of 'mutual benefit' as the key motivating factor and aim for development cooperation as an area of public policy. A mix of motivations has always driven development cooperation, yet the current policy trend differs in that such motivations are made explicit. As a consequence, recent policies suggest that these different interests represent 'win-wins' rather than trade-offs and conceptualize a common development agenda for the donor and recipient countries. Given that political discourse promotes and prepares legal and accountability systems, public scrutiny and independent evaluation are a few steps behind and largely restricted to analyzing benefits for developing countries. The article argues that articulating all goals of development cooperation can facilitate evaluation practice in this changed setting, as effects considered to be 'unintended' from the perspective of promoting development goals may, in fact, be intentional or anticipated from a mutual benefit perspective.

This special issue aims to take up the academic challenges as laid down by those authors, by providing among others a clear typology and applying it, by outlining various methodological options and testing them, and elaborating on suggestions on how to deal with the barriers that prevent unintended effects being taken into account. This special issue makes clear that it is possible to reduce the share of unforeseen effects of international cooperation. Turning the spotlight on unintended effects that can be anticipated, and aiming to make progress on uncovering those that are particularly difficult to detect and debunking those that are exaggerated is the task that lies ahead of us.

Crowdsourced members of the public and a group of educational administrators read a description of a hypothetical program and two evaluations of the program: one conducted by a researcher and one conducted by program staff (i.e. program stakeholders). Study participants were randomly assigned versions of the scenario with different levels of stakeholder credibility and types of findings. Results showed that both samples perceived the researcher's evaluation findings to be more credible than the program staff's, but that this difference was significantly reduced when the program staff were described to be highly credible.

Our hypothesis is that these effects are substantial and overall positive, depending on the level of analysis. This article theorizes about unintended wage effects at the individual level, spillover effects, and those at the macro level, yet focuses its research on individual-level effects. The empirical part consists of two case studies. One takes a sample of grants from a donor agency, the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as a starting point, following these grants through the aid chain to determine local staffing costs. The other case study consists of a comparative wage analysis in a developing country, the Democratic Republic of Congo. As this field of research is rather fresh, instead of answering relevant questions with respect to wage effects, this study merely aims to identify questions that merit further research.

Measuring the economic worth of dental residency training This study estimated whether continued programming of a highly specialized four-year dentistry residency training in Saudi Arabia was cost-beneficial. We utilized a purposive sampling to administer a survey to trainees in major cities. Additionally, we used publically available market information about general practitioners. We employed Benefit-Cost Analysis accounting approach as a conceptual framework. Using general practitioners as the base category, we grouped overall social analytical perspectives into resident trainees and rest of society. The residency program was cost-beneficial to trainees, realizing an estimated return of SR 4.07 per SR 1 invested. The overall societal return was SR 0.98 per SR 1 invested, slightly shy of a bang for the buck, in part because the public sector largely runs the training. Benefits included increased earnings and enhanced restorative dentistry skills accruing to trainees; increased charitable contributions and programming-related payments accruing to programs and the public; and practice-related payments accruing to governmental, professional, and insurance agencies. Rest of society, notably government underwrote much of the cost of programming. A sensitivity analysis revealed the results were robust to uncertainties in the data and estimation. Our findings offer evidence to evaluate whether continued residency training is cost-beneficial to trainees and potentially to overall society.

However, literature relating to the creation of interventions designed for use within the early childhood education and care settings to support children's social and emotional skills and learning is lacking. Intervention Mapping (IM) is a systematic intervention development framework, utilising principles centred on participatory co-design methods, multiple theoretical approaches and existing literature to enable effective decision-making during the development process. Early childhood pedagogical programs are also shaped by these principles; however, educators tend to draw on implicit knowledge when working with families. IM offers this sector the opportunity to formally incorporate theoretical, evidence-based research into the development of early childhood education and care social and emotional interventions. Emerging literature indicates IM is useful for designing health and wellbeing interventions for children within early childhood education and care settings. Considering the similar underlying principles of IM, existing applications within early childhood education and care and development of interventions beyond health behaviour change, it is recommended IM be utilised to design early childhood education and care interventions focusing on supporting children's social and emotional development.

Facilitators are often asked to help groups organize information about and better understand the problem in order to develop and prioritize solutions. However, despite existence of several methods to elicit and characterize how individuals and groups think about and conceptualize an issue, many are difficult to implement in practice-based settings where resources such as technology and participant time are limited and research questions shift over time. This paper describes an easy-to-implement diagramming technique for eliciting conceptualization and a flexible network analysis method for characterizing changes in both individual and group conceptualization. We use a case example to illustrate how we used the methods to evaluate African American adolescent's conceptual understanding of obesity before and after participating in a series of four systems thinking workshops. The methods produced results that were sensitive to changes in conceptualization that were likely driven by the specific activities employed during the workshop sessions. The methods appear strong for capturing salient levels of conceptualization at both individual and collective levels. The paper concludes with a critical examination of strengths and weaknesses of the methods and implications for future practice and research.

Too often, however, the human factor is relegated to an input or an externality in a quasi-technical process for transforming public funds into measurable results. Within the Weberian rational-legal order, policies and bureaucracies are impersonal and objective. Policy objectives tend to get depersonalized and the human stories get filtered out of impact evaluations. This article, on the basis of case descriptions, argues that following the human stories in development policy and implementation can offer surprising insights into why at times policies may work or not work. The article explores how the idiosyncrasies of individuals' agency impact on achievement of policy outcomes and what the unintended effects are. It describes how the human factor can give rise to beneficial unplannable, unforeseeable, and thus unintended policy outcomes. This article argues that, instead of negating this, policy makers ought to embrace the human factor of development cooperation.

There is now a solid consensus among the international evaluation community regarding the need to consider unintended outcomes as a key aspect in any evaluative study. However, this concern often equates to nothing more than false piety.

This study evaluated PIR's effectiveness for individual and system-level outcomes. A total of 25 PIR participants (male = 7, female = 15, not stated = 3) provided data for the evaluation of the program across six community mental health service providers in Canberra, Australia. Individual-level measures included quality of life, social inclusion, and perceptions of recovery. System-level individual measures included confidence in the health system, perceptions of organisation of care, and network analyses. Global single-item scores were measured at baseline (retrospectively), midpoint, and endpoint. Scaled scores for quality of life and social inclusion were measured at midpoint and endpoint only. Multi-level fixed effect models demonstrated significant improvements in global quality of life (p = .008), social inclusion (p = .025), perceptions of recovery (p < .001), and confidence in the health system (p = .013) from baseline to endpoint. Mean scaled scores did not improve from midpoint to endpoint. Two network analyses demonstrated the central role of the support facilitator.

Integrating the gender dimension in research content and teaching is one of its three objectives. It is arguably the objective where least progress has been made. In this article we contribute to the evidence base by applying the EFFORTI evaluation framework to three empirical case study interventions that aim to integrate the gender dimension in tertiary education and research content. Comparison is based on an evaluation of the design of the intervention, those factors that have enabled/ hindered its implementation as well as an assessment of outcomes and impacts. The findings of the case studies highlight the importance of design, specifically regarding resources, legal status and the definition and operationalisation of the gender concept. Implementation hinges on top-level institutional commitment and mainstreaming gender studies with support of a central unit and crucially gender competence. A lack of recognition and status of gender studies and subsequent innovations was seen to hamper implementation. Outcomes and impacts included an increased awareness and interest in gender, increased gender competence, a push towards gender equality regarding representation and organisational change as well as an improved accreditation process and more and better research.

The case of Germany This article examines whether two of the major German flagship programmes to increase the participation of female researchers in the German science system, the \"Women Professorship Programme\" and the \"Pact for Research and Innovation\", have actually increased the number of women, especially in leadership positions. In a second step, we analyse whether such an assumed increase influences the publication patterns of authors with German affiliation. This article is based on literature and desk research as well as bibliometric analysis using Scopus. The most important result is that the number of women in research has indeed increased significantly in recent years and that, accordingly, more women are the (co)authors of scientific publications. In particular, it can be seen that quality indicators such as citations and excellence rates are high for female authors. This enables us to show that more women in the science system not only bring about a \"gain in justice\", but also a concrete scientific benefit.

The existing literature about ECB has focused on capacity building experiences and organizational research, with limited attention on challenges that internal evaluation specialists face in building organizational evaluative capacity. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a Delphi study with evaluation specialists in the United States' Cooperative Extension Service and developed a consensus on the most pervasive ECB challenges as well as the most useful strategies for overcoming ECB challenges. Challenges identified in this study include limited time and resources, limited understanding of the value of evaluation, evaluation considered as an afterthought, and limited support and buy-in from administrators. Alternatively, strategies found in the study include a shift in an organizational culture where evaluation is appreciated, buy-in and support from administration, clarifying the importance of quality than quantity of evaluations, and a strategic approach to ECB. The challenges identified in this study have persisted for decades, meaning administrators must understand the persistence of these issues and make an earnest investment (financial and human resource) to make noticeable progress. The Delphi approach can be used more often to prioritize ECB efforts. Evaluation capacity building; Challenges; implementation success using large-scale consensus decision-making - A new approach to creating medical practice guidelines A study involving over 2000 stoma care nurses in the development of best practice guidelines for the assessment of peristomal body profiles, patient engagement and patient follow-up was conducted in 2018. The study was designed to develop guidelines for stoma care treatment and product selection and to decrease the evidence to implementation gap. The project built on research evidence from a literature review of 77 articles. The results of the literature review were then used to inform a series of Delphi surveys sent out to stoma care nurses through Association and industry list-serves in 11 languages. The Delphi surveys were followed by a face2face professionally facilitated discussions among nurse-research experts. The project concluded with a facilitated consensus dialogue among 960 stoma care nurses from 25 countries, resulting in an implementation plan to ensure the guidelines become a normal part of routine patient care. The study resulted in a set of medical practice guidelines for stoma care nurses, designed to improve patient outcomes and patient quality of life, that were accepted and adopted into routine medical practice across 25 countries. This article describes the study and how the process used, coined the 'Modified Delphi Process' by the process designer, led to faster implementation than is generally experienced in the medical community.

Models to determine effective implementation practices are needed. The Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework is one model that can be used to evaluate program implementation in preschool settings. The Jump Start program provided short-term intervention to children in low-income preschools from multiethnic backgrounds. The goal was to promote prosocial behaviors while minimizing problem behaviors. Various evidenced-based practices (i.e., I Can Problem Solve, play therapy, Pyramid Model) were utilized. 305 children from 73 childcare centers participated in the program. The majority of participants were from ethnic minority backgrounds and resided in high-poverty areas of the county. The RE-AIM framework was utilized to determine program outcomes. Results showed successes on each level of RE-AIM with an at-risk population. The Jump Start program significantly increased positive behaviors and decreased challenging behaviors in preschool-aged children. Results indicated medium to large effect sizes. One year following program participation, the majority of children who participated in the program were at decreased risk of special education services and expulsion.

The aim of this article was to conduct a logic analysis to evaluate a case management program for frequent users of healthcare services. The study proceeded in three phases: 1) establishing causal links between the program's components by the construction of a logic model, 2) developing an integrated framework from a realistic synthesis, and 3) making a new reading of the case management program in regard of the integrated framework. The study demonstrated, on one hand, strengths and weaknesses of the actual case management program, and, on the other hand, how logic analysis can create a constructive dialogue between theory and practice.

Evaluation as a field has resisted a common definition (Crane, 1988; Morell & Flaherty, 1978; M. F. Smith, 1999), which has implications for marketing, training, practice, and quality assurance. In this position paper, I describe the benefits and challenges of not having a clear, agreed-upon definition, then propose and explore the implications of two definitions for the evaluation profession based on values and valuation as the core of evaluation practice. The purpose is to describe a possible way forward through definition that would increase our professional profile, power, and contribution to social justice.

These assumptions guide much of the subsequent instructional design process, including learning objectives, learning experiences, assessment techniques, and more. Most of the existing literature in evaluator education is descriptive in nature, and there has been limited attention to research on pedagogy specific to evaluation or identification of effective practices for teaching evaluation. As a result, we know very little about the theoretical or practical pedagogy of evaluation. As a first step in understanding this pedagogy, this article first synthesizes relevant concepts, principles of learning, and models of instructional design principles of learning developed in the field of education. The authors then offer case examples of how these ideas, principles, models, and pedagogies apply to five evaluation-specific courses. Evaluation; Evaluator LaVelle, John M.

In this paper we focus on the development of the share of women researchers in four national innovation systems, i.e. in Austria, Denmark, Hungary and Spain in the time period 2005-2015. The four selected cases represent countries with significant differences in their innovation capacity, gender regimes and progress of gender equality in R&I. A qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) is carried out to conduct a sector program evaluation based on statistical data and qualitative studies to understand the dynamic development of the proportion of women researchers. The study aims to provide insights into the aggregated gender equality interventions and policies implemented in the four countries studied and their contributions to the development of the proportion of women scientists at the structural level. The analysis reveals that the development of the share of women researchers during the studied period has been particularly influenced by contextual factors, namely the relative size of the business enterprise sector and the share of women among holders of tertiary education. While this is the case, it is found that gender equality interventions need to be more widespread and more effectively designed to be a strong contributing factor to an increasing representation of women in R&I.

Emancipatory research models emphasize the importance of inclusive research practices. Video vignettes are a promising tool for research and program evaluation with people with IDD because they are standardized, they use visual imagery rather than relying on written or verbal communication, and they allow for distance from sensitive topics. The Leadership for Empowerment and Abuse Prevention (LEAP) project used video vignettes to evaluate a healthy relationship program for people with IDD. The authors discuss the process of piloting various protocols and measures, which then ultimately led to the use of video vignettes in the evaluation.

To date there has not been a way to systematically measure institutionalization of health promotion interventions outside of healthcare settings. The purpose of the present study was to develop and evaluate the initial psychometric properties of an instrument to assess institutionalization (i.e., integration) of health activities into faith-based organizations (i.e., churches). This process was informed by previous institutionalization models led by a team of experts and a community-based advisory panel. We recruited African American church leaders (N = 91) to complete a 22-item instrument. An exploratory factor analysis revealed four factors: 1) Organizational Structures (e.g., existing health ministry, health team), 2) Organizational Processes (e.g., records on health activities; instituted health policy), 3) Organizational Resources (e.g., health promotion budget; space for health activities), and 4) Organizational Communication (e.g., health content in church bulletins, discussion of health within sermons) that explained 62.3 % of the variance. The measure, the Faith-Based Organization Health Integration Inventory (FBO-HII), had excellent internal consistency reliability ( = .89) including the subscales ( = .90, .82, .81, and .87).

Seven data collection methods were used: patron surveys, patron panel studies, focus group discussions, key informant and staff interviews, secondary data analysis, media analysis, and observations. The goal of the evaluation was to assess library performance for both formative and summative purposes by addressing evaluation questions on areas such as library services, use, and operations. Building upon the literature review of how mixed-methods approaches can contribute to library evaluation, the aim of this article is to show how a mixed-methods evaluation can be designed to examine multi-faceted library performance and to illustrate how the evaluation design allows information complementarity and can be utilized to present diverse viewpoints of the above three perspectives. The evaluation design, analysis process, and lessons learned from this study may be useful to evaluators engaged in evaluation of public services or programs (including public libraries) that examine multiple aspects of service performance and involve a variety of stakeholders.

As increasing numbers of professionals began working in the CSP field, it became necessary to capture the know-how to make it better understood. This first phase of the initiative took advantage of one of the KM stages, the codifying process that is absent from KT models. The evaluation aim to answer the question: \"What is the CSPs practitioners level of familiarity with the codification document, as well as their perceptions of its utility and its contribution to the understanding of the CSP model\". The results, show that most respondents had consulted the codification document and were able to describe in detail parts of it. The results also show that they considered it to be a useful and necessary tool to guide practices and helpful in understanding the model. The results of this evaluation is paving the way for the next steps of the KT initiative.

The evaluation focused on delineating core processes, strategies, and external contextual elements of group prenatal care implementation and scale-up. Success of this scale-up was enhanced by the effective use and creation of windows of opportunity, which allowed stakeholders to pursue actions consistent with their own values, at both state and organizational levels. Most importantly, strong political advocacy and state-level financial commitment for group prenatal care made it possible for clinics throughout South Carolina to begin providing CenteringPregnancy to their patients. Improved understanding of the processes involved in scaling-up pilot interventions may enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of future expansion efforts.

The purpose of the study was to explore the feasibility of conducting a 12-week intervention utilizing a Fitbit to increase PA behavior in inactive rural adults recruited from a primary care clinic. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with study participants (n=10) and a focus group was held with nurses (n=7) from the primary care clinic. Data were analyzed using the process of immersion/crystallization. Participants and nurses both felt the program had a positive impact on PA and that the program was needed in the community. Study participants most often reported their favorite part of the study was being able to track their activity as well as the goal setting. However, study participants reported barriers to continued participation in PA related to a lack of time and ability to be active in cold weather. Further, nursing staff reported barriers in regard to a lack of resources (staffing and money) These barriers need to be examined further and addressed in order to implement a sustainable PA program that can be maintained through a primary care clinic.

Testing a model for training program evaluators in situation awareness Evaluation approaches should be appropriate for their contexts. Scholars and practitioners alike have widely acknowledged this view for at least four decades, and the ability to respond to context is clearly established as a core evaluator competency. Outside of evaluation, this knowledge of context, known as situation awareness, is seen as a critical feature of good decision making and as a factor that distinguishes experts from novices across a wide range of domains. Yet there are few opportunities for evaluators to explicitly build their skills in situation awareness. This study addressed that gap by examining the potential for one online training program, informed by research on deliberate practice, to accelerate evaluators' progress towards expertise in situation awareness. Built to align with evidence on developing situation awareness skills, the EvalPractice portal combined (1) an extensive 'case bank' of real-world evaluation scenarios, (2) repetitive practice that allowed novice evaluators to practice interpreting these evaluation scenarios, and (3) immediate feedback on the accuracy of these efforts based on events from the real-life version of the scenario. Findings from a small EvalPractice pilot suggest that it may be possible to improve foundational situation awareness skills using deliberate practice, but that further research is required to understand strategies for building higher-level situation awareness skills in evaluation.

Women and men living with disabilities engaged with IPV prevention programs in four countries were interviewed to explore how disability shaped their experiences of gender, violence, IPV, and whether the programs met their disability related needs. In-depth interviews were conducted with 16 women and 15 men living with disabilities in Ghana, Rwanda, Tajikistan and South Africa. The data were analysed thematically and compared across the settings. Participants described experiencing disability-related stigma, discrimination, exclusion, and for women, increased vulnerability to IPV. Barriers to full participation in programs included limited accessibility, and lack of disability-specific materials, recruitment or outreach. Enablers of inclusion included recruitment and monitoring strategies aimed at people with disabilities, partnering with a local disabled people's organization, training staff in disability inclusion, and raising awareness of disability rights. The data encouragingly suggests that inclusion of women and men with disabilities in IPV prevention programs designed for the general population has beneficial outcomes. Inclusion can prevent violence, promote their wellbeing, support economic empowerment, and challenge disability-related stigma and discrimination.

The conceptual framework presented herewith embraces the complexity, gender-sensitive and theory-based evaluation approaches ensuring that design and evaluation of gender equality interventions consider the complex systems that constitute the context in which the interventions operate. The evaluation framework offers a non-linear concept, where the notion of contribution - not attribution - to achieve impact is central to the integration of team, organizational and system factors in policy design and evaluation. The paper opens the \"black box\" to address the question of how and why a policy intervention works and in which context and discusses a systematic process on how to approach the interwoven linkages between input, implementation and effects in gender equality interventions in research and innovation, accounting for context sensitivity and methodological pluralism. The evaluation framework may serve as reference for researchers, evaluators, policymakers and other stakeholders in designing and assessing gender equality interventions, and in further developing their evidence, and theoretical and methodological base.

This research is distinctive in comparison to previous studies because it is structured in a two-stage DEA analysis for efficiency by distinguishing between the technology and operations of the current eight fields of weapon systems and by adding the external index for government competence and market competence. In 2016, in comparison to the year 2013, the eight major weapon systems' efficiency fields of the overall system of Korea, efficiency of technological competence, and efficiency of operations all increased. This research introduced the input and output variable that fits in with the defense industry by connecting the weapon systems efficiency with the national innovation system and the sectoral innovation system that are both projected in this industry. It also formed the concepts of technological competence efficiency and operations efficiency using the two-stage Network DEA method.

This mixed methods case study begins to address the dearth of empirical evidence assessing the impacts and learner experiences of competency-based approaches to evaluator education. A decade-in-the-making doctoral evaluation course based on the Canadian Evaluation Society's Competencies for Canadian Evaluation Practice created an opportune study setting. We applied a systems perspective to Stufflebeam's Context, Input, Process, and Product (CIPP) model to frame the case study analysis and presentation of the complex impacts generated by pre/post course competency self-assessments and reflections, integrated with an end-of-course focus group.

The article argues that to fully understand problem definitions, programme design and organisational change processes related to gender equality, scholars and practitioners cannot focus one-sidedly on expected outcomes and effects; we must also factor in cultural narratives, because gender equality actors never arrive at their work as 'tabulae rasae'. A community of actors always draws on shared dispositions that give sense, direction and shape to their anticipations of the future hereby guiding their actions in the present. Based on an ethnography of a multinational engineering company, the article shows how cultural narratives may serve in different ways as support factors for gender equality programme planning and implementation, if they are actively but mindfully engaged. This mindfulness is important as positive cultural narratives may entail problematic gender dimensions. On the other hand, negative cultural narratives may entail important learning outcomes that may benefit future gender equality initiatives. The analysis further points to the centrality of strategic communication, leadership commitment and comprehensive evaluation in order to mobilise the potential of cultural narratives as support factors to gender equality work. Finally, this article offers a rich example to scholars and practitioners of how to employ cultural analysis in relation to gender equality activities, and demonstrates the value of the insights produced by this analysis for the case company and its gender equality programme.

The case of Germany This article examines whether two of the major German flagship programmes to increase the participation of female researchers in the German science system, the \"Women Professorship Programme\" and the \"Pact for Research and Innovation\", have actually increased the number of women, especially in leadership positions. In a second step, we analyse whether such an assumed increase influences the publication patterns of authors with German affiliation. This article is based on literature and desk research as well as bibliometric analysis using Scopus. The most important result is that the number of women in research has indeed increased significantly in recent years and that, accordingly, more women are the (co)authors of scientific publications. In particular, it can be seen that quality indicators such as citations and excellence rates are high for female authors. This enables us to show that more women in the science system not only bring about a \"gain in justice\", but also a concrete scientific benefit.

While it is increasingly used in Quebec, Canada, studies have not analyzed its medium-term impacts and potential long-term impacts. We conducted a contribution analysis using in-depth interviews with key stakeholders, as well as documents, observation and images related to HIA in order to analyze its impacts on the revitalization of road infrastructure, parks and green spaces, and residential housing. Our analysis not only reflects on the decision-making process through the adoption and implementation of HIA recommendations, but also on the link between actions implemented in the field and health outcomes. Health impact assessment; Contribution analysis; Expanding evaluator competency research: Exploring competencies for program evaluation using the context of non-formal education The overlap of competencies between general program evaluation and specific contexts or content will always be reality because evaluators may need unique competencies to answer evaluation questions for particular contexts or content areas. Limited research exists that explores the essential competencies required by professionals who use evaluation as one part of their job portfolio, which leaves unanswered questions regarding the applicability of current evaluator competency models in such settings. We used a modified three-round Delphi technique to identify evaluator competencies for non-formal educators in Cooperative Extension (CE). Our panelists identified 36 competencies in the non-formal educational programming context for CE educators that they considered important to be included in evaluation capacity building efforts. We categorized our 36 identified competencies from the Delphi study into the five competency domains proposed by the American Evaluation Association. Our findings provide information to help guide professional development among non-formal educators related to program evaluation.

Furthermore, when the citizens are involved in co-design, the participation processes are seldom fully inclusive, and the results are not representative of the entire local community. The paper starts from these considerations for developing an innovative participatory design method to renew urban parks. This method simultaneously uses multiple and alternative participation tools for adapting to the different technical skills of the citizens and to their inclinations. Furthermore, it entails the analysis and interpretation of the expectations of the local community in light of the urban green network. The method uses the conceptual framework of the SWOT analysis and the Trochim's concept mapping for developing a card game playable face to face or online. The results of the card game are processed using the statistical analysis to identify the main design themes (the clusters), and to split the participants' suggestions into different design alternatives. Successively, the participants vote these alternatives for selecting the renewal design respondent to the local community's needs. Participatory process; Green urban M.

Grey relational analysis is one of the multiple attribute decision-making methods and data envelopment analysis is used to calculate the efficiency. Regarding the importance of water and wastewater companies' services, the present study, evaluates the performance and rank these companies by using grey relational analysis and data envelopment analysis approaches based on balanced scorecard criteria. Besides, balanced scorecard considers all levels of organization. In this research, statistical population includes thirty-five municipal water and wastewater companies in Iran for the year 2017. In order to ascertain grey relational grade, fuzzy normalization method was used then by subtracting normalized numbers from one, reference sequences obtained and in the next step, grey relational coefficient was calculated and finally, grey relational grade was determined by multiplying relative weight from Shannon entropy to relational coefficients. In order to assess companies' efficiency in data envelopment analysis, after ascertaining input and output indices, with the assumption of constant returns to scale and output-oriented viewpoint, the efficiency scores were calculated. Also, to rank efficient units Anderson-Petersen model implemented. Results demonstrated that, grey relational analysis is a more accurate method to measure the performance of water and wastewater companies.

This study provides an empirical inquiry into how ECB develops sustained evaluation practice. Interviews were conducted with 15 organizational leaders from non-profits, higher education institutions, and foundations that \"bought in\" to ECB and were at least six months removed from an ECB contract. The result of this work highlights how sustained evaluation practice developed over time and what these practices looked like in real-world settings. A developmental, iterative cycle for how ECB led organizations to sustain evaluation practice emerged around key components to sustainability. First, leadership supported ECB work and resources were dedicated to evaluation. Staff began to conduct and use evaluation, which led to understanding the benefits of evaluation, and promoted value and buy-in to evaluation among staff. Common barriers and emerging sustainability supports not previously identified by ECB literature\u2014the \"personal\" factor and ongoing ECB practitioner contact\u2014are described.

This methodological choice was intended to enable First Nation approaches to data generation and use in equal measure to non-indigenous approaches. The method is implemented as a nested, up-hierarchy of scale, enabling a pan-optican dimension of vision from \"below\" and \"above\". The paper does not present the evaluative results regarding the implementation of the Plan because that information is co-owned by the participating Nations for their uses. Instead, and in respect of that arrangement, the paper presents the evaluation practices funded by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. The methodology was negotiated and implemented with the Nations in the pilot study as a co-production across cultural boundaries. The approach was then evaluated by the participants, and these results are reported. All those reviewing the methodology were directly involved in some aspect of the evaluation, 64 % of whom identified as Traditional Owners, 67 % of whom were involved in high level decision-making about the evaluation approach. Traditional Owners rated cultural competence of the tested approach at 68 %, the benefits of the approach at 75 %, satisfaction with the standard of the evaluation at 72 %, and satisfaction with complying with the Basin Plan's requirements for evaluation at 78 %.

Although research training programs can empower RRPs to rise to these challenges, there is a lack of evidence on how they should be developed and refined. At Memorial University, a faculty development program (FDP) called 6for6 has been helping RRPs surmount their research quagmires and engage in scholarship since 2014. After an initial three-year (2014-17) pilot, we prepared a detailed plan to evaluate the 6for6 research FDP for RRPs and inform future years of delivery. Using a modified Delphi method and participatory action model a group of program team members, stakeholders and evaluation experts developed an evaluation plan including a logic model and an evaluation matrix addressing five key themes. To our knowledge, this is the first evaluation plan for a research-focused FDP targeting RRPs. While this plan was developed specifically for the 6for6 FDP, our approach to its development may be useful to any institution interested in evaluating an FDP with limited resources.

The Urban Mental Health Programme (UMHP) is a pilot initiative that has attempted the integration of mental health services in primary health care settings in two municipal wards in Kolkata, West Bengal, India. The overarching aim of this paper is to describe the methodology used for the evaluation of the community based mental health programme and to understand the processes of the programme in terms of barriers and facilitators. The current evaluation is based on a concurrent nested design, where qualitative and quantitative data are both collected at the same time but analysed separately and priority was given to qualitative data. This experience will contribute in helping other researchers to make some evaluations more effective, useful and manageable. Ethics approval was obtained from an institutional ethics committee of an organization (Ekjut) based in Ranchi, Jharkhand, India. The evaluation was undertaken by the George Institute for Global Health, New Delhi from February- June 2016.

White Physical Education for Progress (PEP) grant. A qualitative exploratory single case study (Yin, 2014) was utilized to examine the elements of the PEP grant that sustained or did not sustain after its conclusion, along with elements that were institutionalized and influences on this process. The findings were represented in the following three themes: (a) positive shifts, (b) backsliding, and (c) new directions, each with their own subthemes. Positive shifts includes sub-themes: (a) philosophy, (b) instruction, assessment and curriculum, (c) collaboration, and (d) respect. Backsliding includes sub-themes: (a) wellness team functioning, (b) the loss of PD and collaboration time, and (c) reduced data collection. New directions includes sub-themes: (a) mastery learning, (b) during school physical activity, (c) stress, and (d) administrative support. The factors that were institutionalized were quality physical education leadership roles, change in teachers' philosophies that influenced their instruction and assessment, and garnered administrative support. These elements were embedded into the physical education program and the school so much so that principals now expect the same type of programming from any new hire.

However, as a social practice, it has become hard to distinguish from auditing, inspection, quality assurance and other means of social control. As a result, the evaluation occupation is now widely viewed as intrusive and burdensome - a self-serving commercial enterprise. Yet, evaluation at its creation was conceived (or perhaps imagined) as a vocation devoted to the public good. This article probes the root causes of the spreading disenchantment; puts Weber's logic of social action to work; and puts his rationalities concepts to work to explore the ethical and professional challenges currently faced by the evaluation community. Bureaucracy; article Network assessment: Design of a framework and indicators for monitoring and self-assessment of a customized gender equality plan in the Mediterranean Engineering Education context With more than 28 active members, the Mediterranean Engineering Schools Network (RMEI) is the most active network on gender equality in the Mediterranean area. Supported by the HORIZON2020 TARGET project 'Taking a Reflexive Approach to Gender Equality for Institutional Transformation', in conceptualizing gender equality learning and system change, the network took a context-specific approach based on a theory of change and other STEM organizational frameworks, to design a self-assessment framework and indicators, considering the systemic view of SDG5 horizontally connected to all SDGs, national context complexity, and transdisciplinary requirements. 95 simple, practical, user-friendly indicators were designed, fitting in the specificities of the Mediterranean-Engineering context. The analysis showed that the network realized its vision, made the 'passage' from theory to praxis on gender equality change, effectively developed meaningful processes/structures, formulated a policy statement, built a community of practice and inspired members. It also achieved trustful relationships and inspired outputs, effective communication, sharing of information and resources, and top management commitment. Critical aspects are a) the analysis in depth of issues linked to the existence of gender-based stereotypes and bias in engineering schools of the Mediterranean that entails tackling gender ideologies considering the whole national social system and existing structures; b) sustainability of gender equality structures created at the member institutions with the support of TARGET project which is depending on the willingness of institution's leaders to continue/advance with gender-sensitive strategies in Program for people with Alzheimer's disease and dementia: Pilot feasibility trial outcomes Alzheimer's disease and dementia are common, highly disabling conditions frequently requiring residential care. This exploratory proof-of-concept study aimed to determine if the specialised Music Engagement Program (MEP) was sustainable, acceptable, and effective in improving quality of life, emotional wellbeing, and depression symptoms in this population. Sixteen residents, six staff members, and three family and community members took part in the evaluation of the MEP for people living with dementia in a residential aged-care nursing home in Canberra, Australia. Multiple methods were used. Quantitative evaluation assessed residents' depression symptoms (Cornell scale) at pre- and post-intervention, and emotional wellbeing pre- and post-session. Qualitative interviews with staff, and family and community members addressed the MEP's acceptability and potential sustainability. Results showed residents' mean depression scores were reduced from pre- to post-intervention (p = .039; dz = 0.72). Interviews established multiple benefits for residents including improved mood, calmness, and reduced aggression. However, staff did not believe it was feasible to continue the MEP sessions beyond the trial period without an external facilitator, citing potential difficulties in adhering to internal activities due to time constraints. This pilot study provides encouraging preliminary evidence for the MEP's acceptability and potential effectiveness for improving depression and wellbeing in this group.

This trend has highlighted the need for accessible and novel approaches to support healthy weights for children and their families to prevent childhood obesity. The purpose of this article is to describe the iterative development and scale-up of a community-led, national-level project to promote healthy weights among Canadian children and families who may be experiencing vulnerabilities. In this project, the Healthy Together program was designed to engage families in an interactive program to support healthy lifestyles. The program also provides a platform for creating supportive environments for healthful lifestyles through practice and policy change. Based on a process evaluation, we describe the iterative development of Healthy Together from Phase 1 through 3 to shed light on processes shaping implementation and scale-up of the program. Lessons learned during each phase were used to refine the program and further expansion. Indicators of successful scale-up include the Healthy Together program's cross-jurisdictional reach and promising evaluation results in real-world conditions. The practice-based program scaling approach provides practical guidance for planning and implementing similar health promotion programs in diverse communities.

Faith, Activity, and Nutrition (FAN) is an evidence-based program that increased physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake in faith-based settings. The aims of this adoption study were to quantify state-wide church level adoption rates and congregant reach of FAN in accordance with RE-AIM guidelines, and to explore the association of CFIR-derived constructs of the church inner setting and pastor characteristics with FAN adoption. Church recruitment was documented, and data were collected via telephone-administered surveys from 93 pastors in adopting churches and 60 pastors in non-adopting churches. Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) identified combinations of CFIR-derived church and pastor characteristics sufficient for FAN adoption. As defined by RE-AIM, church-level FAN adoption was 11.7 % and congregant-level reach was 20.0 %. Fourteen pathways to adoption were identified; seven of these featured the presence of a culture of concern for congregant health along with openness to new ideas. Results suggest early assessment of these two CFIR-derived inner setting constructs may help identify faith-based organizations predisposed to undertake a comprehensive, environmental intervention P.

This suggests that performance analysis and measurement of NPOs might also involve multiple perspectives, such as in Balanced Scorecard (BSC) or in the Logical Framework (LF) models. Balanced scorecard; pilot study of a culturally-grounded mindfulness-based stress reduction program with older First Nations Australians First Nations 'survivors' are ageing in increasing numbers. Life-course stress and depression are of concern for older First Nations Australians, yet there are limited psychosocial interventions. This study aimed to co-design a culturally-grounded mindfulness-based program ('Ngarraanga Giinganay') and evaluate acceptability/feasibility with an Aboriginal community on Gumbaynggirr Country. An expert Working Group guided program development, with Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal clinicians/consultants. A workshop, collaborative yarning group with older Aboriginal people (n = 9), and further consultation contributed to the design/refinement of the 8-session group-based program, ensuring content aligned with therapeutic principles of mindfulness and cultural understandings of the Gumbaynggirr community. A single-group pilot study was conducted (n = 7, 6281 years), co-facilitated by an Aboriginal clinician and Elder. Outcomes were qualitative (understandings of mindfulness, program acceptability, benefits to health/wellbeing). Pilot results demonstrated feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effectiveness. The program enhanced understandings of mindfulness and participants highlighted benefits such as helping anxiety, relaxation, focusing on the moment and connection to Country/land. Trends were seen for reducing depression, anxiety and stress symptoms, and blood pressure. This study provides insight into partnering with underrepresented populations through ageing research, highlighting the effectiveness of this co-design approach. Ngarraanga Giinganay has considerable potential for supporting health and wellbeing of First Nations peoples.

A critical synthesis of evaluation literature Validity is both a critical foundation for, and widely contested concept in the field of program evaluation. Given the wide and divergent treatment of the term, this article sought to enhance the field's understanding and application of validity by systematically identifying, collating and integrating existing conceptions of validity. A critical interpretive synthesis approach was taken to combine the best elements of systematic literature searching with integrative review. We found that conceptions of validity could be roughly collated into three categories pertaining to the evaluation research, evaluative judgement and reporting, and beyond the evaluation proper. The result was a wide-ranging map of validity concepts against the various stages of the evaluation process. This made clear several gaps in the validity thinking, resulting in the development of comprehensive but not yet complete framework that weaves together related aspects identified into a cohesive whole. It is our hope that this initial iteration of a cohesive validity framework will be the starting point for a cooperative effort to improve professional evaluation practice.

However, little translation of recovery knowledge has occurred in mental health services. The purpose of this research is to bridge the gap between recovery guidelines and practice by developing a new implementation strategy involving the formation of implementation teams made up of different stakeholders (service users, service providers, managers, knowledge users) and facilitating a 12-meeting implementation planning process. Sevenmental health organizations across Canada successfully completed the process of translating the guidelines into a recovery-oriented innovation that was implemented. Fifty-five implementation team members were interviewed upon completion of the 12-meeting process. Findings indicate that implementation team members perceived the structured planning process as positive. Nevertheless, the language of implementation science remains difficult to understand for a non-academic audience. Key elements of the 12-meeting process included the value of consensus building among implementation team members and the subsequent shifting power relationships. While working with diverse stakeholders came with certain challenges, the process in itself was a form of system transformation. This type of engaged planning process was a significant departure from the more top-down approaches to organizational change that staff were used to.

To achieve these goals, CRPs offer a variety of activities that research and theory suggests should produce positive outcomes among their students; yet the lack of systematic evaluation research in this area means it is unknown which programming components may drive outcomes. Recovery capital theory posits a variety of factors at multiple ecological levels that might influence students' recovery experience and their engagement and success in community programs like CRPs. To address this complexity in research and evaluation work on CRPs, we provide a recovery capital-oriented theory of change and logic model for CRP evaluations, and demonstrate how this model could be used with an exemplar case. This is followed by a recovery capital-oriented data collection toolkit for future research and evaluation. These efforts should help to inform program planners and evaluators interested in understanding the influence of the ecosystem of recovery-oriented systems of care in CRPs for emerging adults.

This paper describes the Quality Improvement and Fidelity Assessment Process (QIFAP), a program purveyor-agency partnership that uses a unique, multi-step method for supporting sustained implementation of the Therapeutic Crisis Intervention (TCI) system to manage crises in child serving organizations. It outlines the steps of the process and highlights how specific activities are linked to current knowledge and principles from implementation science. The QIFAP occurs over a period of about three months, during which time program developers and agency representatives conduct staff surveys, a two-day site visit, and fidelity assessments in order to gather information, discuss findings, and plan steps for improving the TCI system in the organization. The process is guided by principles that emphasize the importance of organization leadership, building relationships, co-learning, using an individualized approach, data informed decision making, acknowledging risk, and congruence. We describe ways in which the strategies and approaches within the QIFAP are rooted in implementation science literature. Thus, the model represents an illustration of how research-based knowledge can work in practice to support long-term, high-quality program implementation.

The main research focus of this study is the blended learning design. Based on the evaluation surveys of training participants, the results showed that participants were highly satisfied with their overall learning in the blended learning model. What was appreciated most was a well-designed course with an instructor to provide good instruction, positive interaction, and quality feedback. The findings show that online courses participants expect synchronous and asynchronous online activities and feedback.

At the first stage of the study, the efficiency of the hospitals was evaluated with input-oriented CCR (Charnes, Cooper, Rhodes) and Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI). At the second stage, panel Tobit regression analysis was utilized to find out the factors that affect the efficiency scores specified at the first stage. According to the results of the first stage, the mean efficiency values calculated for 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 were 0.83, 0.90, 0.86, and 0.80, respectively. At the second stage, it was revealed that the variables of not being in a metropolis and having 200 beds at least had statistically a significant effect on the efficiency score (p < 0.05) whereas being a training and research hospital was ineffective (p > 0.05). The number of the studies which assess the efficiency of maternal and child health hospitals in Turkey was quite limited. Moreover, such studies do not contain second-stage analyses. Lastly, it is thought that those results will provide health policy-makers substantial and evidence-based information in the allocation of the resources for the related services. Efficiency; DEA; the planning and evaluation of narrative intervention reviews: Systematic Transparency Assessment in Intervention Reviews (STAIR) Narrative reviews offer a flexible way to report intervention results and comprise the majority of reviews published in top medical journals. However variations in their transparency pose evaluation challenges, compromising their value and potentially resulting in research wastage. Calls have been made to reduce the number of narrative reviews published. Others argue narrative reviews provide an important platform and should even be placed on an equal footing to systematic reviews. We believe narrative intervention reviews can provide a vital perspective when transparent, and thus support Systematic Transparency Assessment in Intervention Reviews (STAIR). This research evaluates the transparency of 172 health-related narrative and literature reviews (K = 172), by assessing how they communicate information about the interventions they review. Eight points supporting transparency, relating to sample sizes, traceability, article numbers, and references, were assessed. Half of the reviews reported on at least four of the eight points, but 24% reported on none. Only 56% of the reviews clearly communicated full references. The STAIR* (Sample sizes, Traceability, Article numbers, Intervention numbers, References*) checklist comprises five sections, and nine points. It is proposed as a convenient tool to address STAIR and complement existing review guidelines to assist authors in planning, reviewers in evaluating, and scholars in utilising narrative reviews. The objectives of STAIR* are to: 1) encourage narrative review transparency and readability, 2) facilitate the incorporation of narrative reviews results into other research; and 3) enrich narrative review methodology with a checklist to guide, and evaluate, intervention reviews.

Based on the results of performance evaluation, organizations can embark on purposeful actions to improve their situation. Obviously, the success of organizations and the economic development of the country depend on the performance of human resources (HR). This paper proposes a novel hybrid evaluation framework for analyzing the performance of public sector organizations. The suggested setting allows for performance evaluation based on a comprehensive approach involving expert knowledge. For this purpose, the research integrates the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) approach and fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. Initially, the employees' performance factors (criteria) are identified from the literature based on the BSC dimensions. Then, the most relevant of them are finalized through the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) questionnaires and experts' opinions. In the second stage, the weights of criteria are determined by adopting the fuzzy best-worst method (FBWM). Moreover, two fuzzy MCDM techniques, namely VIKOR and Grey Relational Analysis (GRA), are used to examine the performance of the eight important public sector organizations of Iran. Finally, a Monte Carlo simulation-based (MCSB) approach and a scenario-based (SCB) approach are applied to compare the effectiveness of fuzzy VIKOR and fuzzy GRA. The results suggest that the critical employees' performance factors include sharing knowledge with colleagues (0.136), optimal use of facilities (0.123) and participation in solving organizational issues (0.118). Additionally, based on the implemented sensitivity analysis approaches, fuzzy VIKOR generates more reliable results and also has higher robustness than fuzzy GRA.

However, deficit approaches may lead young people to becoming dependent on services and face greater marginalization and stigmatization. Meeting long-standing calls to focus more on young people's positive attributes and abilities, the My Strengths Training for Life (MST4Life) program was developed as a community partnership with a large housing service. This paper describes the rationale, logic model, and content of the MST4Life program using the TIDieR (Template for Intervention Description and Replication) checklist. MST4Life is a strengths-based and experiential psychoeducation intervention for young people aged 16-24 years who are homeless or at risk. Grounded in positive youth development and basic psychological needs theory, its aim is to provide meaningful opportunities for participants to recognize, use, and further develop their mental skills and strengths. In turn, enhancing intentional self-regulation is expected to improve physical, mental, and social health and wellbeing, and support positive transitions to independent living. The potential long-term impacts include a reduction in the number of young people returning as homeless, lower rates of mental illness and mortality, and a cost saving to the public purse.

In this paper we have developed a modified approach that includes additional public effects and their distribution between project participants in the financial and economic model of the research infrastructure project. Evaluation methods are based on the transition from financial to economic efficiency by adjusting cash flows and including indirect effects (impact of technological spillovers), externalities (knowledge spillovers and ecological effects) and tax effects. Policy and practical implications are closely examined with a focus on the distributional effects for the Core Facility Project of the Catalyst Center in Novosibirsk Academic Town. The results show that a significant excess of economic returns compared to financial returns is determined mainly by the indirect benefits of private participants who use the results of the project, but are not direct participants in this project. The main impact on the financial efficiency arises at the investment stage through direct support measures, complemented by private funding. Indirect support measures only work successfully during the operational stage. Stimulation of the investments in research infrastructure through government support essentially depends on the choice of a certain combination of government support instruments and project financing. Research infrastructure; Investment project; Financial and economic organisational and system-level factors act to influence health promotion evaluation capacity: Validation of a conceptual framework The need to improve the practice and quality of evaluation in the health promotion and disease prevention field is widely recognised. In order to plan, implement and evaluate health promotion evaluation capacity building efforts, there is a need to better understand the practitioner, organisational and system-level determinants of evaluation capacity and practice. This study aimed to assess the validity Evaluation Practice Analysis Survey (EPAS) constructs using confirmatory factor analysis and validate a conceptual framework of health promotion evaluation capacity using path analysis. Experienced Australian health promotion practitioners completed the survey (n = 219). Twenty-one of the original 23 EPAS scales were assessed as reliable and valid. The final model was found to have good fit (214 = 18.72, p = 0.18, root mean square error of approximation = 0.04, 90% CI 0.00-0.82, Comparative Fit Index = 1.00, standardised root mean square residual = 0.04). This model supports the role of the organisation in facilitating evaluation practice through leadership, culture, systems, support and resources. It builds on existing frameworks from other fields to incorporate political, funding and administrative factors. This study provides an evidence-based model of evaluation capacity that organisations, funders and policy makers can use to plan and implement more effective evaluation capacity building strategies within organisations and the wider prevention field.

Incomplete stakeholder insight threatens long-term sustainability of new training programmes. We drew on collective experiential knowledge of capacity building for children's nursing in southern and eastern Africa to articulate a Capability Maturity Model (CMM), using a six-stage process to: identify necessary supportive conditions; specify levels of process maturity; develop domains; characterise levels of capability; consult with stakeholders; and finalise the model. We articulated a comprehensive CMM describing five levels of process maturity in relation to education, clinical and regulatory systems, human resources for health systems, and requirements related to overall stakeholder collaboration. The model makes visible the range of regulatory and associated processes involved in developing a new educational programme for specialist nurses, including educational standards, quality assurance, scopes of practice, and systems for licensing and registering specialist children's nurses. Stakeholders can use the model as a map to identify where they are in the process, and establish the resources and actions needed to make further progress. Health of e-government in times of disruption: The case of public education in Rwanda during Covid-19 lockdown The world has been in the grip of the Covid-19 pandemic since 2019. The Rwandan Government failed to establish e-government infrastructure to provide e-education during the lockdown (a.k.a Guma mu Rugo or Stay home), resulting in all children having to repeat the academic level they were in when the lockdown started in March 2020. The problems in Rwanda's education during Covid-19 are partly attributed to the government's ICT (a.k.a ikorana buhanga in Kinyarwanda) platform which does not prioritise e-education services, government's inability to provide infrastructures for e-government, and the lack of ICT equipment and skills. Research on the aspects of e-government and e-education in Rwanda is limited. Knowledge is scarce about what happened to public education in Rwanda during the lockdown. This study aimed to explore the effects of the lockdown on Rwanda's public education and how e-education could have helped provide public education. A desktop research method, involving collecting data from existing sources on e-government and the state of public education in Rwanda during Covid-19, was conducted. The results show that the lockdown has negatively affected public education because the country failed to provide e-education services. To address the impact of the Covid-19 lockdown and possible future lockdowns, the Government of Rwanda must establish an e-government infrastructure that provides e-education. It will also need to establish affordable infrastructure in rural areas where it does not exist. Covid-19; Government of article Using the science of positive psychology in the formative evaluation of social justice interventions: A case example The pursuit of culturally responsive approaches for designing and evaluating programs to promote social justice has become of the utmost importance to the evaluation community in the past decade. A strengths-focused evaluation approach has great promise for empowering individuals, groups, communities, and organizations, and identifying program strengths to build upon in addition to illuminating program deficits. However, there is a dearth of literature on using a strengths approach to evaluate interventions and programs to promote social justice. Drawing from the two disciplines of positive psychology and evaluation, this article illustrates a strengths-focused approach to formative evaluation using a case example of a halfway house for previously incarcerated women. The findings exemplify the positive psychological phenomena that emerge as a result of focusing the evaluation on program strengths. The case demonstrates that the application of a strengths-focused approach to evaluating social justice interventions can be empowering for institutions and the communities they serve.

In large-scale public projects, it is frequently observed that the client, who serves the public, seeks the services of several sub-contractors (project outsourcing firms) to execute projects. It also seeks the consulting firms' services to monitor the progress and performance of these sub-contractors. However, performance evaluation of a large number of sub-contractors is not only a challenging phase but also a source of conflict and mistrust between the evaluators and evaluatees because of the subjectivity in the evaluation process. The current study classifies perceived organizational performance into two streams, arguing that the one involving the opinions from the independent evaluators is more objective than the self-evaluation one. The study also makes a pioneering attempt in post-qualification performance evaluation of sub-contractors through the Ordinal Priority Approach (OPA), a promising multi-attribute decision-making methodology. The deployment of the OPA allows the decision-makers to estimate the weights of the evaluation criteria, the sub-contractors to be evaluated, and the experts who evaluated them simultaneously. Thus, the methodology can minimize the causes of mistrust by uncovering unreliable experts and inappropriate criteria. Also, a novel Relative Performance Index (RPI) has been proposed to standardize the performance evaluation system. The results show that evaluation of the firms does not end at their evaluation as without evaluating the evaluators, such an evaluation is only partially effective.

This requires evaluators to expand their evaluation repertoire to continue to provide useful and actionable information. Our study illustrates the application of user experience evaluation as part of the formative evaluation of the Community Engagement Toolkit (CETK), developed by the Network of the National Library of Medicine. The CETK is a website containing resources that help library staff deliver health-literacy programming more effectively. The overarching objective of the evaluation was to obtain in-depth feedback from potential users about the website design and content in order to make the toolkit user friendly and useful. We used an online video conferencing software to conduct contextual observations and interviews with geographically dispersed participants. Findings from the evaluation study indicated an overall favorable review of the toolkit's interface and navigation, but relatively less favorable review of content relevance and broad appeal for the participants. Feedback from the participants was used to inform the development of the toolkit to increase the likelihood of its use and value for intended users.

The critical role of qualitative data in teachers' decision making The push for data-based decision making in schools has largely centered on the use of quantitative data to inform technical-rational processes of teachers' decision making. Previous attention to teachers' reliance on qualitative data - particularly unsystematically collected qualitative data - tends to focus on their use of intuition and is often characterized as a counter to evidence based inquiry. Limited research, however, has been conducted to understand how teachers actually apply available data within their classrooms, the factors that shape teachers' decision making, or what they consider credible in assessing their students' progress and achievement. In this collective case study, 15 teachers from three high schools discuss how they exercise professional judgment and make instructional decisions based on qualitative evidence. It takes an intentionally grounded approach to exploring the many data points that teachers draw upon as they face decision moments in their daily practice. In interviews and observations over the course of one school year, teachers describe various types of qualitative data that shed light on students' experiences as they undertake processes of learning. As these teachers glean bits and pieces of systematically and unsystematically collected qualitative data, including informal, undocumented data through conversations and observation, these data inspire reflective questioning and hypotheses about their instructional practice. While student progress should not be wholly assessed based on qualitative data, the findings show that we must acknowledge the inevitable and critical role these data play in guiding teachers' actions and informing their professional judgment. The persistent integration of qualitative data - though sometimes pointed to as a threat to rational decision-making processes - instead confirms a reliance upon them in guiding classroom instruction and a need to ensure their appropriate use.

The nutrition intervention strategy under the Malnutrition Reduction Program [MRP] has the components of complementary feeding among children six months to below three years old and nutrition education among mothers/caregivers. This intervention was monitored and determined the facilitating and hindering factors in implementation. A total of 32 cities/municipalities were included in the monitoring using qualitative and quantitative methods, specifically, in-depth interviews among implementers. Results showed that the implementation of the intervention strategy at the local level was primarily facilitated by the commitment of local chief executives (LCEs) who gave full support to the intervention, presence of local resolution on its adoption, and accessibility of complementary food production facility which provided the complementary food supplies for the intervention. Other facilitating factors to implementation were the presence of manpower and other resources like the active involvement of local nutrition implementers. However, the multiple workload of key implementers and with nutrition program as least priority in the local agenda were challenges in program implementation. From this monitoring study, the commitment of LCEs, consideration of nutrition as a priority program, and active participation of both implementers and participants contributed in effective program implementation.

Specifically, through the use of baseline data from the Swedish government Staten's Institutions Styrelse (SiS) database, for 2658 individuals who were assessed at their compulsory care intake interview by social workers in the national social welfare system between 2001 and 2009 the study identified the associations between specific predisposing, enabling and need characteristics and repeated addiction compulsory care entries. The logistic regression model identified that individuals whose children have been mandated to the child welfare system, who have experienced prior compulsory care including compulsory treatment through LVU (law (1990:52) with specific provision about care of young people under 18), and those who have been in prison are more likely to have two or more entries in the addiction compulsory care system compared to their counterparts. Individuals who have been mandated to compulsory care for their substance use disorder two or more times have significant multiple complex problems and repeated experiences of institutionalization. These individuals are a group in need of a well-coordinated and integrated system of aftercare services to reduce the likelihood of re-entry into addiction compulsory care.

This article focuses on employee performance-management practices in the healthcare sector. We specifically aim to contribute to a better understanding of the impact of employee performance-management practices on affective well-being of nurses in hospitals. Theory suggests that the features of employee-performance management (planning and evaluation of individual performances) predict affective well-being (in this study: job satisfaction and affective commitment). Employee performance management; Vertical Performance centralised ethics review processes: Implications for multi-site health evaluations Increasingly, public sector programmes respond to complex social problems that intersect specific fields and individual disciplines. Such responses result in multi-site initiatives that can span nations, jurisdictions, sectors and organisations. The rigorous evaluation of public sector programmes is now a baseline expectation. For evaluations of large and complex multi-site programme initiatives, the processes of ethics review can present a significant challenge. However in recent years, there have been new developments in centralised ethics review processes in many nations. This paper provides the case study of an evaluation of a national, inter-jurisdictional, cross-sector, aged care health initiative and its encounters with Australian centralised ethics review processes. Specifically, the paper considers progress against the key themes of a previous five-year, five nation study (Fitzgerald and Phillips, 2006), which found that centralised ethics review processes would save time, money and effort, as well as contribute to more equitable workloads for researchers and evaluators. The paper concludes with insights for those charged with refining centralised ethics review processes, as well as recommendations for future evaluators of complex multi-site programme initiatives.

Effective child and family centered service planning is crucial to addressing vulnerable children's needs. However, there is limited evidence about what facets of these processes improve service use and outcomes. The current study used a Poisson random effects hazard model to test correlations between fidelity to NC's Child and Family Support Team model and time to service receipt, using case management data for 3396 children served by that program during the 2008-2009 school year. Students were more likely to receive recommended services more quickly when caregivers and the students attended planning meetings, when their plans included services for caregivers, and when child and family team leaders followed up after meetings to verify service receipt. Contrary to the Child and Family Support Team theory of change, match between student needs and the lead agency of the meeting was not associated with the odds of quicker service receipt, nor was attendance by natural supports. Findings from this study demonstrate the potential effectiveness of using case management systems to measure service planning process fidelity, as well as how results thereof can both inform process improvement and potential refinements to models' theories of change.

As part of a larger clinical trial, the current study investigates the feasibility of providing electronic case management (ECM) to homeless youth, using cell-phones, texts, email, and Facebook. Youth were given prepaid cell-phones and a case manager who provided four ECM sessions every 2-3 weeks over a 3-month period. Contact logs were used to record how many youth engaged in ECM, how many attempts were necessary to elicit engagement, and youths' preferred technology methods for engaging. Although engagement in the number of ECM sessions varied, the majority of youth (87.5%) engaged in at least one ECM session. Youth (41%) most commonly needed one contact before they engaged in an ECM session, and the majority responded by the third attempt. While youth most commonly answered calls directly, their chosen method of returning calls was texting. The majority of youth (80%) described ECM positively, reporting themes of convenience, connection, and accountability. The use of ECM, particularly of texting, offers promising implications for providing services to homeless youth.

Exploring participant involvement in the Active Living Coalition Health coalitions serve as an important \"vehicle\" to strengthen horizontal and vertical ties between organizations, community groups, and individuals whose intent and purpose is to improve wellness. Having a strong and diverse group of participants is essential for highly effective coalitions to carry out their mission in an organized and participatory manner. However, the extent that individuals become involved in coalition operations and activities remains ambiguous. A grounded theory approach was used to explore expressions of participant involvement of a local health coalition known as the Active Living Coalition (ALC). Open, axial, as well as domain and taxonomic coding were used to analyze transcripts from four focus groups (n=37 participants) in order to develop a participant continuum that captured six network aggregates within the coalition. Findings suggest that participation, for the most part, was heterogeneous and ever-changing given the expectations of the level of partnership that best individuals' personal and professional interests. Differentiating the type of participants in health coalitions can help coalition leaders more successfully \"manage\" new and existing relationships. Findings imply that health coalitions can maximize coalition capacity by drawing upon the full range of potential human and material resources by further understanding the types of individuals that make up their network.

In addition, researchers have recognized the need to empirically evaluate such programs to ensure that youth are provided with optimal opportunities to thrive. This study represents a utilization-focused evaluation of Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, a female-only physical activity-based life skills community program. A utilization-focused evaluation is particularly important when the evaluation is to help stakeholders utilize the findings in practice. The purpose of this study was twofold: (a) to gain an understanding of the ongoing successes and challenges after year two of program implementation and (b) to examine how the adaptations made based on feedback from the first year evaluation were perceived as impacting the program. From interviews with youth participants and program leaders, three main themes with eight sub-themes emerged. The main themes were: (a) applying lessons learned can make a significant difference, (b) continually implementing successful strategies, and (c) ongoing challenges. Overall, this evaluation represents an important step in understanding how to improve program delivery to better meet the needs of the participants in community-based programing.

This systematic review provides an overview of CM indicators used in evaluation and then focuses on the use of linking constructs\u2014those measures of the process of CM between programmatic outputs and outcomes. We identified 108 English-language articles evaluating 86 CM interventions that target SRMH. Content analysis was used to code CM indicators into five categories: qualitative descriptions of CM; participation, diffusion and community action indicators that measure tangible, programmatic outputs; and linking constructs that capture the process of moving from participation to empowerment. Fifty-five (64.0%) interventions include a CM indicator. Diffusion indicators are most common (56.4%); linking constructs are least common (20.0%). We found 23 linking constructs used in evaluations of 11 interventions, with limited information on psychometric properties available. Three evaluations report positive relationships between linking constructs and condom use, one of which was significant in multivariate analysis. To better understand how CM leads to improved outcomes, we recommend increasing the measurement of linking constructs in evaluations of CM interventions. Research should focus on developing and validating new linking construct indicators and better disseminating existing measurement tools.

This study examined whether mental health community service users completed outcome self-reports differently when assessments were supervised by internal vs. external staff. The examination of potential differences between the two has useful implications for mental health systems that take upon themselves the challenge of Routine Outcome Measurement (ROM), as it might impact allocation of public resources and managed care program planning. 73 consumers completed the Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA), a shortened version of the Recovery Assessment Scale (RAS), and a functioning questionnaire. Questionnaires were administered, once using support provided by internal staff and once using support provided by external professional staff, with a one-month time interval and in random order. A MANOVA Repeated Measures showed no differences in outcomes of quality of life and recovery between internal and external support. Functioning scores were higher for the internal support when the internal assessments were performed first. Overall, except for the differences in functioning assessment, outcome scores were not determined by the supporting agency. This might indicate that when measuring quality of life and recovery, different supporting methods can be used to gather outcome measures and internal staff might be a good default agency to do this. Differences found in functioning assessment are discussed.

The process involved identification of the relevant evidence base, development of a theoretical understanding of the phenomenon of unintended teenage pregnancy in relation to young men, and exploratory mixed methods research. The result was an evidence-based, theory-informed, user-endorsed intervention designed to meet the much neglected pregnancy education needs of teenage men and intended to increase both boys' and girls' intentions to avoid an unplanned pregnancy during adolescence. In prioritising the development phase, this paper addresses a gap in the literature on the processes of research-informed intervention design. It illustrates the application of the MRC guidelines in practice while offering a critique and additional guidance to programme developers on the MRC prescribed processes of developing interventions.

Much of the focus has been on defining organizational evaluation capacity, which can be thought of as the competencies and structures required to conduct high-quality evaluation studies (capacity to do), as well as the organization's ability to integrate evaluation findings into its decision-making processes (capacity to use). This paper seeks to contribute to this growing body of knowledge through a multiple case study of EC across three different organizations (e.g., non-profit, provincial government and federal government, herein named sectors); the novelty of this particular study is that each case study is based on the use of a common measurement tool developed by Bourgeois, Toews, Whynot and Lamarche (2013). The cross-case analysis presented in the paper reveals that evaluation capacity tends to be higher, both in terms of capacity to do and capacity to use, in organizations that have developed systematic mechanisms to institute an evaluation culture within their walls. Interestingly, however, we also found that capacity to use does not first require capacity to do, as evidenced in the non-profit organization under study.

The purpose of this paper is to document a practical process evaluation of a southeastern nonprofit, a local Meals on Wheels. Using a mixed methods approach, we sought to answer four evaluation questions: (1) What are the essential program components, as identified by key stakeholders; (2) To what extent are volunteers implementing the identified essential components as intended; (3) What is the level of volunteer satisfaction with the program; and (4) What suggestions do stakeholders have for improving the program? Our findings indicate that most aspects of the program were implemented as intended, but inconsistencies occurred when volunteers were unsure of their assigned duties. In addition, volunteers had high levels of satisfaction and specific suggestions for improvement. From these results, we developed a conceptual model of factors contributing to quality of implementation and volunteer satisfaction that may be generalizable to other volunteer-based nonprofits. Specifically, we identified three factors that helped to facilitate satisfaction and performance: leadership, social contact, and fulfillment.

This research was conducted as part of the 2013 comprehensive needs assessment for the Northeast Georgia Ryan White Consortium using an anthropologically informed mixed-methods design, and a deductive-inductive approach to thematic analysis of qualitative data obtained in interviews and focus groups with service providers and service utilizers. Our comprehensive needs assessment yielded two key components. First, we identified salient phenomena influencing introduction to, retention among, and satisfaction of patients in the Ryan White-coordinated treatment cascade in NE-GA. Second, we formulated actionable recommendations around leverage points identified in the current district-wide system of care. Results highlight spatial, institutional, and interpersonal aspects of the system of care that intersect around issues of patient privacy, psychological health, and social stigma. These intersections constitute pathways by which persons living with HIV are exposed to stigma and other negative social signals regarding their health status without sufficient access to behavioral health services. These negative issues, in turn, can erect significant barriers to long-term continuity in care.

Not only are there contextual differences related to project location, there are often relatively few programmatic requirements, which results in variations in program models, target populations and services. The Jail Diversion and Trauma Recovery-Priority to Veterans (JDTR) National Cross-Site Evaluation was tasked with conducting a multi-site evaluation of thirteen grantee programs that varied along multiple domains. This article describes the use of a mixed methods evaluation design to understand the jail diversion programs and client outcomes for veterans with trauma, mental health and/or substance use problems. We discuss the challenges encountered in evaluating diverse programs, the benefits of the evaluation in the face of these challenges, and offer lessons learned for other evaluators undertaking this type of evaluation.

The case of Tuscany The role of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems in the field of development cooperation has globally increased in last decades. International and regional organizations, as well as states, local governments and NGOs have largely adopted the tools provided by M&E in order to enhance transparency, effectiveness and efficiency. The paper aims at verifying how and to what extent the implementation of M&E systems has affected the overall quality of international cooperation projects financed by a local government. After a literature review on M&E in development cooperation, the research analyzes the wide range of activities (evaluation ex-ante, mid-term, final, monitoring, consultancy) carried out by the Evaluation Team of the XY in the last eight years in behalf of an Italian local government: the Region of Tuscany. The paper reveals the strategic significance of adopting M&E systems in the medium-long term. Monitoring; Ex-ante evaluation; Development an enhanced probation program: Evaluating process and preliminary outcomes Supervision, Monitoring, Accountability, Responsibility, and Treatment (SMART) is Kentucky's enhanced probation pilot program modeled after Hawaii's Opportunity Probation with Enforcement (HOPE). SMART is proposed to decrease substance use, new violations, and incarceration-related costs for high-risk probationers by increasing and randomizing drug testing, intensifying supervision, and creating linkages with needed resources (i.e., mental health and substance use). SMART adopts a holistic approach to rehabilitation by addressing mental health and substance abuse needs as well as life skills for fostering deterrence of criminal behavior vs. punitive action only. A mixed methods evaluation was implemented to assess program implementation and effectiveness. Qualitative interviews with key stakeholders (i.e., administration, judges, attorneys, and law enforcement/corrections) suggested successful implementation and collaboration to facilitate the pilot program. Quantitative analyses of secondary Kentucky Offender Management System (KOMS) data (grant Year 1: 07/01/2012-06/30/2013) also suggested program effectiveness. Specifically, SMART probationers showed significantly fewer: violations of probation (1.2 vs. 2.3), positive drug screens (8.6% vs. 29.4%), and days incarcerated (32.5 vs. 118.1) than comparison probationers. Kentucky's SMART enhanced probation shows preliminary success in reducing violations, substance use, and incarceration. Implications for practice and policy will be discussed.

Stakeholders of WellnessRx identified web-based education learning modules on nutrition and physical education as a priority to be integrated into existing health sciences curricula, as well as adapted for use by health professionals. Five learning modules were created with essential knowledge, skills, attitudes and resources or tools for health professional students and practitioners. As part of the 'developmental evaluation framework' for WellnessRx, two of these modules were piloted within two health professional student programs. This paper describes the pilot-evaluation experience involving student surveys, focus groups and interviews, and faculty perspectives. For both modules, student pre-post knowledge assessments indicated some improvements in post-module knowledge. Post module evaluations by students indicated benefits with the online delivery being flexible for access, self-health, case-based assessments and useful nutrition and physical activity guides. Challenges for students included their time to do the modules and the activity expectations. Instructors felt each module could be better targeted to different years within an undergraduate program. Through developmental evaluation, the pilot results along with recommendations and lessons learned provided the direction needed to further develop the WellnessRx logic model and proposed learning modules.

Merging data from three national level register databases of those sentenced to compulsory care from 2001 to 2009 (n=4515), the aims of this study were to: (1) compute mortality rates to compare to the general Swedish population; (2) identify leading cause of mortality by alcohol or narcotics use; and (3) identify individual level characteristics associated with mortality among alcohol and narcotics users. In this population, 24% were deceased by 2011. The most common cause of death for alcohol users was physical ailments linked to alcohol use, while narcotics users commonly died of drug poisoning or suicide. Average age of death differed significantly between alcohol users (55.0) and narcotics users (32.5). Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified the same three factors predicting mortality: older age (alcohol users OR=1.28, narcotic users OR=1.16), gender [males were nearly 3 times more likely to die among narcotics users (p<.000) and 1.6 times more likely to die among alcohol users (p<.01)] and reporting serious health problems (for alcohol users p<.000, for narcotics users p<.05).

In this paper we assess the validity of the Progress out of Poverty Index (PPI), a country-specific indicator based on ten closed questions on directly observable household characteristics, by its compliance to the SMART criteria. Each response receives a pre-determined score, such that the sum of these scores can be converted into the likelihood the household is living below the poverty line. We focus on the PPI scorecard for Rwanda, which was validated using two national household surveys conducted in 2005/06 and 2010/11. The PPI is Specific, Measurable, Available cost effectively, and Timely available. Yet, its Relevance depends on the way it is used. Although it accurately distinguishes poor from non-poor households, making it a useful reporting tool, its limited sensitivity to changes in poverty status restricts its usefulness for evaluating the impact of development projects.

Global efforts have helped to link women to surgical repair, but thus far no evidence-based interventions exist to address the psychological needs of these women during the hospital stay. In this paper, we describe the development of a psychological intervention for women in Tanzania who are receiving surgical care for an obstetric fistula. The intervention was developed based on theories of cognitive behavioral therapy and coping models. Content and delivery were informed by qualitative data collection with a range of stakeholders including women with fistula, and input from a study advisory board. The resulting intervention was six individual sessions, delivered by a trained community health nurse. The session topics were (1) recounting the fistula story; (2) creating a new story about the fistula; (3) loss, grief and shame; (4) specific strategies for coping; (5) social relationships; and (6) planning for the future. A trial run of the intervention revealed that the intervention could be delivered with fidelity and was acceptable to patients. A future randomized control trial will evaluate the efficacy of this intervention to address the mental health symptoms of this population.

This study sought to determine whether addressing previously identified implementation barriers to integrating on-site rapid HIV testing into the treatment admissions process would increase offer and acceptance rates. Results indicate that it is feasible to integrate rapid HIV testing into existing treatment programs for substance abusers when resources are provided. Addressing barriers such as providing start-up costs for HIV testing, staff training, addressing staffing needs to reduce competing job responsibilities, and helping treatment staff members overcome their concerns about clients' reactions to positive test results is paramount for the integration and maintenance of such programs.

The Christian Alliance for Children in Zambia (CACZ) operates a program called Milk and Medicine (M&M) that distributes food, formula, and medicine at churches in the compounds. This article reports on a mixed methods study to evaluate the outcomes of the M&M program. On-site interviews with families combined with an analysis of a longitudinal data set were the methods used. The results of the study showed families face continuous hardship including hunger, unemployment, disease, and loss. Families expressed appreciation for the program and its staff and suggested improvements. The longitudinal data review helped researchers to recommend an improved protocol for data management. Improved data will assist researchers in an on-going evaluation to compare the growth rates of children in the study to the Zambian normal growth charts. Lessons learned from this evaluation validated the use of mixed methods design for exploratory research on an emerging program. Lessons were also learned about the difficulty of working in natural settings with political and cultural variations. Future evaluations of the M&M program are expected to shed light on more specific program impacts.

One middle school was randomly assigned to the G.O.A.L. intervention and another from the same urban school district in the Midwestern U.S. to a comparison condition. Thirty boys, ages 10-14 years, participated in each school. The intervention, guided by the Health Promotion Model (HPM) and Self-Determination Theory (SDT), consisted of a 90-min after-school physical activity club 4 days/week and one motivational interviewing session with a registered (school) nurse. Data were gathered via attendance records, club observations, heart rate monitors, audio-taping of motivational interviewing sessions, and surveys. On average boys attended the club 2.11 days/week (SD=.86). A trained independent process evaluator reported that the physical activity club instructors provided the boys with the opportunity for a mean of 25.8min/day of MVPA. Using a four-point Likert scale (1=disagree a lot; 4=agree a lot), the process evaluator perceived that the club was delivered with high fidelity and adherence to the underlying theories (M=3.48; SD=0.39). Sessions with the nurse lasted an average of 13min, 29s. All boys attended. Two trained independent coders indicated that the nurse demonstrated at least beginning proficiency for all tasks associated with motivational interviewing, with the exception of using sufficient open- as opposed to closed-ended questions and reflections compared to questions. Fidelity related to session delivery and adherence to the theories was high (M=3.83; SD=0.19).

The limited treatment and rehabilitation programs that are available for these women are usually developed for male offenders and do not consider factors that are especially relevant to women, such as higher rates of mental health and substance use disorders as well as their likely histories of interpersonal violence. Moreover, women's trajectories into violent behavior - as well as their trajectories out - may differ from their male counterparts. Due to the absence of programs available for this unique population, a new gender-specific and trauma informed intervention, Beyond Violence, was developed. This paper describes a pilot study with a mixed-methods approach that assesses the feasibility and fidelity of the intervention within a state prison for women. Overall, various components of feasibility (i.e. engaging the target population, gaining institutional support, and finding skilled treatment staff), were realized, as were fidelity elements such as adherence to the intervention material, and high attendance and satisfaction by participants. The positive results of this pilot study increase the likelihood of dissemination of the intervention and a randomized control trial is currently underway.

Yet there is a paucity of evaluation tools for community engaged interventions aimed at closing the gaps and improving health. The Guide to Community Preventive Services (the Community Guide) developed by the Task Force on Community Preventive Services (the Task Force) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends two healthcare system level interventions, case management interventions and disease management programs, to improve glycemic control. However, as a public health resource guide for diabetes interventions a model for community engagement is a glaringly absent component of the Community Guide recommendations. In large part there are few evidence-based interventions featuring community engagement as a practice and system-level focus of chronic disease and Type 2 diabetes management. The central argument presented in this paper is that the absence of these types of interventions is due to the lack of tools for modeling and evaluating such interventions, especially among disparate and poor populations. A conceptual model emphasizing action-oriented micro-level community engagement is needed to complement the Community Guide and serve as the basis for testing and evaluation of these kinds of interventions. A unique logic model advancing the Community Guide diabetes recommendations toward measureable and sustainable community engagement for improved Type 2 diabetes outcomes is presented.

It is focused on the European Union context and specifically on the Greek LEADER operational program. The results of this application indicate that DEA, in contrast to traditional performance metrics, is an insightful tool in revealing administrative inefficiencies in program delivery by capturing the operational and scale components of performance while taking into account the complex mix of tasks and interventions carried out by its operators.

This generates the need to create socially acceptable and economically sustainable models for the protection of the elderly. The goal of this paper is to stress the necessity of analyzing and evaluating the efficiency of social protection services aimed at senior citizens. The first part of the paper underlines the need for economic analysis of these services; while the second part features the analysis of the two most frequently provided services for the elderly in Serbia: admission to social protection institutions and home care for senior citizens. Based on the research results, the paper also provides a comparative overview of the efficiency of the services mentioned. This overview clearly confirms that both services prove to be economically justifiable from a social perspective; nevertheless, it also indicates that the cost of home care per user is considerably lower than the cost of putting a senior citizen into a nursing home. After presenting and discussing the results of the studies, the paper also offers recommendations aimed at enhancing the development and sustainability of the social protection system for the elderly in Serbia.

An evidence-based professional development framework, the 5 Ms, has been effective in helping staff to improve PA in both girls and boys but further improvements in girls' PA are needed. Little is known about staff's perceptions of using PA promotion strategies to promote girls' PA. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore staff perceptions of the use of evidence-based PA promotion strategies for promoting PA in girls. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with staff from three community-based afterschool programs located within a school setting (n=18). Data were analyzed using the process of immersion/crystallization. A majority of staff had some knowledge of PA promotion strategies but few staff consistently utilized these strategies and a majority felt several strategies were unnecessary (i.e., having a PA policy). Newer staff reported depending on senior staff to promote PA in girls. Overall, findings suggest that staff's perceptions may impact their use of PA promotions strategies. The results of this study will contribute to the enhancement of an existing staff training framework (the 5 Ms) to improve girls' PA in afterschool programs.

This article reviews the discussion and use of complexity theory within academic journal literature. The aim is to identify the issues to be considered when applying complexity theory to evaluation. Reviewing 46 articles, two groups of themes are identified. The first group considers implications of applying complexity theory concepts for defining evaluation purpose, scope and units of analysis. The second group of themes consider methodology and method. Results provide a starting point for a configuration of an evaluation approach consistent with complexity theory, whilst also identifying a number of design considerations to be resolved within evaluation planning.

Findings from eight program staff focus groups, 351 youth participants' comments, four key program documents, and results from six previous Project K research projects were integrated to produce a theory of change for the program. A direct logic analysis was then conducted to assess the plausibility of the proposed theory against relevant research literature. This demonstrated that Project K incorporates many of the best practice principles discussed in the literature that covers the three components of the program. The contributions of this theory-building process to organizational learning and development are discussed.

We do this by linking two bodies of knowledge - the 70-year theoretical tradition of community-based research and the trans-discipline of program evaluation - that are seldom intersected within the evaluation capacity building literature. We use the three hallmarks of a community-based research approach (community-determined; equitable participation; action and change) as a conceptual lens to reflect on a case example of an evaluation capacity building program led by the Ontario Brian Institute. This program involved two community-based groups (Epilepsy Southwestern Ontarioand the South West Alzheimer Society Alliance) who were supported by evaluators from the Centre for Community Based Research to conduct their own internal evaluation. The article provides an overview of a community-based research approach and its link to evaluation. It then describes the featured evaluation capacity building initiative, including reflections by the participating organizations themselves. We end by discussing lessons learned and their implications for future evaluation capacity building. Our main argument is that organizations that strive towards a community-based approach to evaluation are well placed to build and sustain a culture of evaluation.

The study, which was conducted at an university in Spain, aimed to design, implement and evaluate a program for training faculty members to respond in an inclusive manner to the needs of students with disabilities. An initial, formative and summative qualitative evaluation was carried out and four instruments were used for collecting the data: group and individual interviews, written open-ended questionnaires and observations. The data were analyzed inductively, using a category and code system. The results reveal that, after the training program, faculty considered what they had learned to be useful for their professional practice and highlighted that they felt better-informed and better-trained in relation to disability and were more aware of the needs of students with disabilities. Finally, in the conclusions section, the paper discusses the results in relation to those reported by other studies, and offers some recommendations for universities planning to implement training policies designed to build more inclusive learning environments.

Introducing trainees to the risks of burnout and supporting identification and proactive responses to their 'warning' signs of compassion fatigue (CF) is critical in building resiliency. The authors developed and evaluated a burnout and CF program for third year trainees at a Canadian Medical School. Of 165 medical trainees who participated in the burnout and CF program, 59 (36%) provided evaluation and feedback of the program and its impact throughout their year. Participation included self-utilization of a validated CF and burnout tool (ProQOL) across three time-points, workshop feedback, and focus group participation. Results highlighted the importance of 1) Recognizing Individual Signs & Symptoms of Stress, CF and Burnout; 2) Normalizing Stress, CF and Burnout for Students and Physicians; 3) Learning to Manage One's Own Stress. A decrease in compassion satisfaction and increase in burnout between beginning and end of third year were found. Further outcomes highlighted the importance of learning, living and surviving CF and burnout in clerkship. Emergent theory reveals the important responsibility educators have to integrate CF and burnout programs into 'the sweet spot' that third year offers, as trainees shift from theoretical to experiential practice as future clinicians.

Through a continuous system of inquiry, reflection, and application of knowledge, developmental evaluation serves as a system of tools, methods, and guiding principles intended to support constructive organizational learning. However, missing from the developmental evaluation literature is a nuanced framework to guide evaluators in how to elevate the organizational practices and concepts most relevant for emergent programs. In this article, we describe and reflect on work we did to develop, pilot, and refine an integrated pilot framework. Drawing on established developmental evaluation inquiry frameworks and incorporating lessons learned from applying the pilot framework, we put forward the Evaluation-led Learning framework to help fill that gap and encourage others to implement and refine it. We posit that without explicitly incorporating the assessments at the foundation of the Evaluation-led Learning framework, developmental evaluation's ability to affect organizational learning in productive ways will likely be haphazard and limited.

The purpose of this paper is to explore potential uses of one such quantitative tool, agent-based modeling, in evaluation practice. To this end, we define agent-based modeling and offer potential uses for it in typical evaluation activities, including: engaging stakeholders, selecting an intervention, modeling program theory, setting performance targets, and interpreting evaluation results. We provide demonstrative examples from published agent-based modeling efforts both inside and outside the field of evaluation for each of the evaluative activities discussed. We further describe potential pitfalls of this tool and offer cautions for evaluators who may chose to implement it in their practice. Finally, the article concludes with a discussion of the future of agent-based modeling in evaluation practice and a call for more formal exploration of this tool as well as other approaches to simulation modeling in the field.

A survey methodology with systematic sampling techniques was used to select 138 households as insider group in four villages' of the Gareh-Bygone plain which is covered by FWSP. Furthermore, key person interview was used to assess the viewpoints of experts (outsider group) who had close, ongoing involvement with the project.

Case study of Kenya, Tanzania and South Africa This research is one of the few attempts to employ the conceptual framework of \"technology transfer\" to analyze the extent that participation in cross-national learning assessments has had on capacity development, particularly in the development of official public structures, by equipping educationists and influencing teachers' competency in Kenya, Tanzania and South Africa. The researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with key informants drawn from the Ministries of Basic Education, national examinations councils, civil society organizations and curriculum development institutions in the three countries. The in-depth interviews were complemented by relevant literature on this topic. The study established improved technical capacities in the public education sector in South Africa and Kenya to design and conduct independent large-scale learning assessments. This important research demonstrates a certain level of commitment by African countries to establish official structures necessary to design/implement and sustain a culture of monitoring learning outcomes through public funded large-scale learning assessments.

Participants (N=154) were children who had been referred by parents/guardians for current or past physical and/or sexual abuse. Parents/guardians of children were interviewed four times over a course of one year. Results indicated children demonstrated substantial improvements in their overall levels of emotional distress, conduct concerns, hyperactivity, and behavioral and emotional functioning. Overall, results support the premise that services provided by BACA may serve as a unique intervention for children who have experienced abuse.

In this article, we presented an evaluation case of a district-wide early learning improvement program. To strike a balance between practicability and academic rigor, we developed comparison groups from multiple perspectives, and used a series of tests consistent with WWC 3.0 standards to reach the most valid comparisons.

This article explores the effectiveness of a specific programme, which sought to improve outcomes of Pacific students in the tertiary environment. The aim of the evaluation was to determine the effectiveness of an intervention programme (2013-2015) to increase the participation and academic success of Pacific students in the first year in Health Sciences. The study found the academic results of Pacific students who participated in the intervention programme were significantly better compared to those who did not. The findings inform future research, suggesting that, when assessing the effectiveness of a programme, it is useful to explore the performance of the whole cohort separately to those who declared intention or interest to attend the programme. Strategies to support participation of each of these groups are likely to be different. Having a standardised approach when comparing groups will adjust for any confounding factors or prior differences. This will allow a more accurate assessment of the effectiveness of the programme being evaluated.

Health Literacy; Evaluation; Health Education; Behavior program costs, and outcomes, of including gender-sensitive services in intensive inpatient programs for substance use Gender-sensitive services (GSS) attempt to make substance use treatment better for women, but at what cost and with what results? We sought answers to these questions in a federally-funded study by measuring separately the patient and provider costs of adding GSS, outcomes, and cost-outcome relationships for 12 mixed-gender intensive inpatient programs (IIP) that varied in amounts and types of GSS. GSS costs to female inpatients included time devoted to GSS and expenses for care of dependents while in the IIP. GSS costs to providers included time spent with patients, indirect services, treatment facilities, equipment, and materials. Offering more GSS was expected to consume more patient and provider resources. Offering more GSS also was expected to enhance outcomes and cost-outcome relationships. We found that average GSS costs to patients at the IIPs were $585 ($515-$656) per patient. Average GSS costs to providers at the IIPs were $344 ($42-$544) per patient. GSS costs to patients significantly exceeded GSS costs to providers. Contrary to previous research, offering more GSS services to patients did not result in significantly higher costs to patients or providers. IIPs offering more GSS may have delivered fewer traditional services, but this did not significantly affect outcomes, i.e., days until returning to another substance use treatment. In fact, median cost-outcome for these IIPs was a promising 35 treatment-free days, i.e., over a month, per $100 of GSS resources used by patients and providers. treatment; Gender-sensitive Sarah E.

Contextual factors affecting ECB implementation have been explored theoretically and practically, but their influence within a changing environment has seldom been discussed. This study examined essential context-sensitive parameters, particularly those involved in implementing new governmental policies regarding higher education. Taiwan was used as a case study for exploring the effect of contextual change on ECB attributes from the perspectives of training receivers and providers. Surveys and interviews were used for data collection and importance-performance analysis was applied for data analysis. Four prominent features were identified. First, the ECB attributes perceived as important by receivers were performed adequately, whereas those perceived as less important were performed less well. Second, under new policies, training provider designed training covering a wide range of ECB, whereas receivers focused on those can be directly applied in evaluation process. Third, in a small education system such as Taiwan's, the complexity of peer review is high and ethical issues become important. Fourth, because the evaluation structure has been changed from single- to dual-track, receivers expect more training for institution staff, whereas providers insist on hierarchical training. Aligning ECB supply and needs is paramount for adaptation to new policies.

The analysis is based on the amount of resources allocated by each of the 645 municipalities in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, to each field, involving consolidated evaluation indicators (IDSUS and IAA, respectively). This study required the prior distribution of municipalities in clusters within homogeneous groups previously proposed in IDSUS calculation methodology. The results suggest that the addressed areas are intimately connected, indicating that larger (and better) environmental investments can produce promising outcomes toward health performance. Therefore, there is a demand for integrated public policies in the context of environmental health. Also, there is the indication that the resource management and the proper allocation thereof may be more relevant than the total amount spent; and that lower cost-effectiveness values do not necessarily demonstrate high scores in the assessed performance indicators.

As a tool to communicate complex social programs, theory based logic models are an effective visual communication. However, after initial development, theory based logic models are often abandoned and remain in their initial form despite changes in the program process. This paper examines the potential benefits of committing time and resources to revising the initial theory driven logic model and developing detailed logic models that describe key activities to accurately reflect the program and assist in effective program management. The authors use a funded special education teacher preparation program to exemplify the utility of drill down logic models. The paper concludes with lessons learned from the iterative revision process and suggests how the process can lead to more flexible and calibrated program management.

We make an attempt to capture a more comprehensive range of intended and unintended outcomes of ET services than those traditionally considered in the case of public transportation services. Using primary data from 23 locations across the country, we present a framework to evaluate how transportation improvements, in interaction with labor markets, can affect users' short-run economic welfare, users' long-run human capital accumulation and non-users' short-run economic welfare. These services were partially funded by a specialized program - the Job Access and Reverse Commute (JARC) program - which was consolidated into larger transit funding programs by recent legislation. In the sites examined, we found that low wage users benefited from self-reported increased access to jobs, improvements in earnings potential, as well as from savings in transport cost and time. Simulations show the potential of users to accrue long-term worklife benefits. At the same time, users may have accrued changes in leisure time as a result of transitioning from unemployment to employment, and generated a range of societal impacts on three classes of non-users: the general tax-paying public, the general commuting public in the service operating area and other low-wage workers in local labor markets. Employment transportation; Job Access article Swimming upstream: The challenges and rewards of evaluating efforts to address inequities and reduce health disparities Racial and ethnic disparities in the health of Americans are widespread and persistent in the United States despite improvements in the health of Americans overall. Increasingly, strategies for reducing disparities have focused on addressing the factors that contribute to - if not fundamentally underlie - health disparities: social, economic, and environmental inequities, which limit access to resources and cause unhealthy exposures. As public health shifts to interventions that seek to improve the circumstances of disproportionately affected populations and achieve equity through policy change, alternative methods to evaluate these efforts are also required. This paper presents an example of such approaches to addressing asthma disparities through Regional Asthma Management and Prevention's (RAMP) programmatic efforts and an evaluation of these activities. The paper describes RAMP's targets and strategies, as well as the specific evaluation methods applied to each, including activity tracking, observations, surveys, key informant interviews, and case studies. Preliminary evaluation findings are presented, as are lessons learned about the efficacy of the evaluation design features - both its strengths and shortcomings. Findings discussed are intended to contribute to the growing literature that provides evidence for the application of emerging approaches to evaluation that reflect non-traditional public health and support others interested in expanding or replicating this work.

To address this gap in the knowledge base, this paper explores the ways in which evaluation context has been addressed in the practical-participatory, values-engaged, and emergent realist evaluation literatures. Five primary dimensions that constitute evaluation context were identified for this purpose: (1) stakeholder; (2) program; (3) organization; (4) historical/political; and (5) evaluator. Journal articles, book chapters, and conference papers rooted in the selected evaluation approaches were compared along these dimensions in order to explore points of convergence and divergence in the theories. Study results suggest that the selected prescriptive theories most clearly explicate stakeholder and evaluator contexts. Programmatic, organizational, and historical/political contexts, on the other hand, require further clarification.

Logic modeling offers a potentially useful approach to learning about the assumptions, activities, and consequences described in an evaluation theory and may facilitate comparative analysis of evaluation theories. However, logic models are imperfect vehicles for depicting the contingent and dynamic nature of evaluation theories. Alternative approaches to studying theories are necessary to capture the essence of theories as they may work in actual practice.

Study cases (N=50) were adolescents with conduct and/or substance use problems randomly assigned to routine family therapy (RFT) or to a treatment-as-usual clinic not aligned with the FT approach (TAU). Observational analyses showed that RFT therapists consistently achieved a level of adherence to core FT techniques comparable to the adherence benchmark established during an efficacy trial of a research-based FT. Analyses of therapist-report measures found that compared to TAU, RFT demonstrated strong adherence to FT and differentiation from three other evidence-based practices: cognitive-behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, and drug counseling. Implications for rigorous fidelity assessments of evidence-based practices in usual care settings are discussed.

This study also identified areas of programmatic strength within the program, as well as areas for improvement. 193 participants in NYSP completed a pre- and post-test that assessed belonging, social competence, athletic competence, and competence related to eight specific sports. Significant improvements in perceptions of overall athletic competence and competence related to five specific sports were found. Although perceptions of social competence and belonging increased from pre-to-post test, findings were not statistically significant. Site observations resulted in the identification of strengths and areas that also inform areas for programmatic improvement. Implications for the design, implementation, and evaluation of sport-based youth development programs are discussed.

Using the logic models developed to depict each of the three evaluation theories (Hansen, Alkin, & Wallace, 2013) as a starting point, both quantitative and qualitative analysis techniques are employed to discuss the similarities and differences across the practice prescriptions. The approaches are then described according to Miller's (2010) standards for empirical examinations of evaluation theory. Specifically, I offer speculation about their operational specificity and feasibility in practice. I argue that none of the models is completely specific, or wholly unique, and they all present challenges of adaptation into the field. However, the models each offer varying degrees of guidance and unique elements through their prescriptions.

Reflections from an accidental theorist In this short paper I reflect on the application of a program logic modeling approach to visualizing evaluation theory as it relates to practical participatory evaluation (PPE). The work of Hansen, Alkin and associates presented in this volume is well-thought out, carefully done, rigorous, and important. I found that their application of the approach resonated well with my understanding of PPE with a few notable exceptions. Specifically, the essence of the partnership aspect of the approach was underemphasized as was stakeholders' role in augmenting the credibility of evaluation findings and PPEs contribution to conceptual use. I then reminisce about the development and evolution of the participatory evaluation framework that we have been working with for so many years. I raise the point that we think of it as a theoretical framework to bound inquiry, not as an evaluation theory per se, which raises an interesting question: when does a theoretical framework become a theory?

The program was initiated in 2004 to strengthen terrorism and emergency preparedness by linking academic expertise to state and local health agency needs. The purposes of the evaluation study were to identify the results achieved by the Centers and inform program planning for future programs. The evaluation was summative and retrospective in its design and focused on the aggregate outcomes of the CPHP program. The evaluation results indicated progress was achieved on program goals related to development of new training products, training members of the public health workforce, and expansion of partnerships between accredited schools of public health and state and local public health departments. Evaluation results, as well as methodological insights gleaned during the planning and conduct of the CPHP evaluation, were used to inform the design of the next iteration of the CPHP Program, the Preparedness and Emergency Response Learning Centers (PERLC).

The program was delivered across 27 geographically dispersed, elementary school sites over a two-year period. In this study we examined the level of fidelity achieved by program implementers across intervention components, the rate of child and parent participation across intervention components, and proximal child outcomes targeted by the intervention across two years of programming. Results showed that over the two-year intervention period the program was implemented with high fidelity, participation rates were acceptable, and children made positive gains on target outcomes similar to those found in previous randomized controlled trials. The results suggest that implementation support services may be advantageous in the wide-scale implementation of prevention programs that aim to achieve high implementation fidelity.

The discussion follows Mark's (2008) framework for research on evaluation and uses Miller's (2010) criteria of discernible impact and reproducibility in order to delineate the theories. The research on evaluation outcomes shows that some of the claims made by each evaluation theory are supported with evidence, but many substantial claims remain untested. The short term and long term goals espoused by each theory show noticeable differences in the consequences of each evaluation approach, with different emphases placed on organizational capacity, use of findings, or perceptions of the evaluation as outcomes of the prescribed evaluation approach.

In response to previous papers in this issue, I consider the ways that logic models of evaluation theories may improve practice. Our conceptions of how theory informs practice are colored by who we have in mind when we speak of practitioners and theorists. I offer working definitions of these roles. It is also colored by the process we imagine connects theory to practice. I present a theory-based explanation of the factors that may shape practice and describe how theorists, using logic models, may be able to exploit these factors to promote the use of their theories. Throughout, I argue that theorists are primarily responsible for the proper use of their theories just as evaluators are primarily responsible for the proper use of their evaluations. This responsibility is best fulfilled in collaboration with the larger community of evaluators. Recent methods and software allow theorists to conduct large-scale theory-building collaborations that are organized around logic models. I discuss the benefits these advances may have for the field.

The PCPS is a universal community-based program to support parenting, during the first 18 months, and to promote protective adaptive systems in children through a schedule of quarterly office-based appointments, starting at 3 months of age. Generally children attend for six visits. When the Program opens in a particular area, parents of all children under 18 months are invited. The different ages of the children who are joining present a unique opportunity to obtain groups to evaluate the program dose-effect using a cohort-sequential design. This dose-effect on parent and infant outcomes was examined by: (1) self-report of parental sense of competence and factors negatively affecting their parenting and (2) the quality of the child's attachment, using Ainsworth's Strange Situation Test. The study was based on 594 families. Results showed dose effects for parental sense of competence, in the parental self-efficacy dimension. The proportion of securely attached children was significantly higher in groups with medium and high program dose. These results were obtained after considering the effect on the parent and child outcomes of two socio-demographic factors that showed differences among the groups under study: single parenthood and working at home. In the variables under study the PCPS, serving a socially deprived area, showed dose effects. The evaluation strategy can be useful for evaluators and planners working with universal programs that offer a longitudinal service.

The current study examined predictors of satisfaction with treatment in patients from a randomized clinical trial of late-life generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in primary care. Higher treatment satisfaction was associated with receiving CBT rather than enhanced usual care. Treatment credibility, treatment expectancies, social support, and improvements in depression and anxiety symptoms predicted higher treatment satisfaction in the total sample. In the CBT group, only credibility and adherence with treatment predicted satisfaction. This suggests that older patients receiving CBT who believe more strongly in the treatment rationale and follow the therapist's recommendations more closely are likely to report satisfaction at the end of treatment. In addition, this study found that adherence mediated the relationship between treatment credibility and treatment satisfaction. In other words, patients' perceptions that the treatment made sense for them led to greater treatment adherence which then increased their satisfaction with treatment.

Quality improvement; Implementation science; evaluation of citizen participation in policymaking: Insights from Portugal While citizen participation in policymaking is on the rise worldwide, the scholarly debate centring around its evaluation has not developed to the same extent. The article discusses the methodology and findings of the evaluation of the project \"Portugal Participa: Caminhos para a Inova\u00e7\u00e3o Societal\" which started at the end of 2014, and was implemented in 2015 and 2016, in Portugal. As the project promoted actions at both national and local levels, the evaluation accounted for both layers with a major focus on the analysis of procedures and outputs to examine its success. Through the application of a multi-method approach - data collection and analysis, cost-effectiveness assessment, interviews, pre-post surveys, and counterfactual focus groups - involving a wide array of agents - political representatives, civil servants, NGOs, citizens, national academia, and the funding sponsor - findings have helped retrieve three main insights that aim to contribute to future research on the evaluation of citizen participation in policymaking, which should shed light on: the (re)connection of multiple agents; the role within the governance systems; and the pursuit of social inclusion. oai:RePEc:eee:epplan:v:84:y:2021:i:c:s014971892030197x2020-12-19RePEc:eee:epplan article A case study on the suitability of STARS for green campus in China With the continuous development of China's green campus, its future construction should learn from foreign advanced development experience and achievements. On the one hand, STARS, a global advanced green campus evaluation system, should be introduced to China's green campus construction and on the other hand, the suitability for China's actual needs should also be considered. Therefore, this study mainly studies the suitability of STARS indicators for green campus in China. Taking a representative university of green campus in China as a specific case, starting from the demand side, this paper uses the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to evaluate the users' satisfaction of green campus construction. Comparing the result of satisfaction assessment with the result of STARS's sustainable evaluation, the STARS's indexes are divided into four regional grades by two-dimensional suitability evaluation coordinate system. The results show that STARS is generally suitable for green campus evaluation in China, but two of the evaluation categories need to modify the evaluation scores and weights; the other two categories are not suitable and need to be removed or changed. The purpose is to provide suggestions for the optimization of the evaluation of green campus in China.

This study tested that recommendation by examining how informative or generic titles impact a visualization's visual efficiency, aesthetics, credibility, and the perceived effectiveness of the hypothetical program examined. Furthermore, this study tested how simple or complex graphs, and positive, negative, or mixed results (i.e., valence of the results) affected outcomes. Participants were randomly assigned to one of 12 conditions, representing a 2 (graph: simple or complex) x 2 (title: generic or informative) x 3 (valence: positive, negative, mixed) between-subjects study. The results indicated that informative titles required less mental effort and were viewed as more aesthetically pleasing, but otherwise did not lead to greater accuracy, credibility, or perceived effectiveness. Furthermore, titles did not interact with graph type or the valence of the findings. While the results suggest it is worthwhile to consider adding an informative title to data visualizations as they can reduce mental effort for the viewer, the intended goal of the visualization should be taken into consideration. Considering the goal of the visualization can be a deciding factor of the type of graph and title that will best serve its intended purposes. Overall, this suggests that data visualization recommendations that impact evaluation reporting practices should be scrutinized more closely through research.

CO-PrIDE implemented a multi-level framework featuring collaboration between health systems and community organizations to link clients to PrEP prescribers and provide support services intended to help clients overcome socioeconomic barriers to PrEP uptake. These services included payment assistance, insurance navigation, and healthcare navigation.

However, there is a dearth of literature describing navigation services in these areas. In the context of Chicago Project PrIDE, this project conducted process and implementation evaluations with eight agencies leading demonstration projects to address these gaps. The evaluation team conducted semi-structured, individual interviews with agency staff (N = 20) assessing navigation implementation and fit, as well as project successes and challenges. Additionally, agency staff collected patient surveys (N = 300) assessing services provided, service quality, and satisfaction. The interview transcripts were coded and analyzed thematically and descriptive analyses were performed on the survey data. Analyses indicated that screening for social determinants of health, providing healthcare engagement guidance, and providing service referrals were frequently cited navigation activities. Most staff members indicated that navigation fits well within their agencies, and that limited staff and clinic capacity were often barriers to navigation. Patient navigation to support engagement in HIV prevention and care services is critical due to the extensive support provided by navigators to address social determinants of health impacting HIV disparity populations.

CDC funded project PrIDE to support 12 health departments (HD) with implementing pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) strategies for men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender persons, with a health-equity focus established by HDs. Each HD conducted mixed-methods evaluation of at least one local strategy. CDC employed a cluster evaluation approach to maximize cross validation. As a result, this cluster evaluation focused on three HDs that evaluated health equity-focused PrEP implementation strategies. Findings suggest that integrating health equity strategies such as storytelling and healthcare worker (HCW) trainings can help reduce HIV-related disparities. Storytelling improved HCW's understanding of clients' experiences of stigma due to racial, gender, and sexual identities. Provider training increased competencies on culturally appropriate care and the use of clinic services by Black and Hispanic MSM and transgender persons. Good practices included community engagement, seeking leadership buy-in, and integration of programmatic staff in health equity and evaluation activities. Evaluating strategies and training policies addressing social determinants of health that adversely affect HIV outcomes may help mitigate barriers Black and Hispanic MSM and transgender populations encounter in their HIV prevention seeking efforts.

Corresponding to this shift, the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention (DHAP) began funding a series of multi-site demonstration projects to provide extra support and evaluative capacity to select health departments to initiate new HIP programming, with the intention of ascertaining and sharing lessons with other health departments. In this paper, we provide context for the PrEP, Implementation, Data2Care, Evaluation (PrIDE) evaluation by describing the evolution of evaluation goals and activities across three prior demonstration projects, highlighting four areas of change: 1) integrated evaluation and program implementation; 2) local program evaluation in addition to cross-site performance monitoring; 3) prescriptive allocation of resources to support local program evaluation; and 4) expansion beyond single site program evaluation to identify effective cross-site programmatic strategies. Together, these changes reflect our own learning about achieving the greatest contribution from multi-site projects and set the stage for unique aspects of program evaluation within PrIDE. We describe these features, concluding with lessons learned from this most recent approach to structuring and supporting evaluation within CDC DHAP's health department demonstration projects.

Each HD conducted a local evaluation (LE) and reported ongoing and planned utilization of evaluation findings in the final LE reports. Information from all reports was abstracted for qualitative analysis to identify main evaluation utilization themes. Findings showed that program evaluation was incorporated as early as the project development phase and designed with the goal of improving, and not just demonstrating the efficacy of the programs. Evaluation data were effectively utilized to improve PrEP and D2C activities, for example, by increasing community engagement throughout LEs, enhancing social media implementation, prioritizing the most effective referral sources at re-linking clients into HIV care, reducing client wait time between receiving PrEP referral and obtaining appointment with provider, and incorporating evaluation findings into program planning and development. Project PrIDE highlights the importance of a planned evaluation in providing ongoing improvements to HIV prevention services to better serve priority populations.

Five storytelling events, held biannually in Baltimore, Maryland from 2016 to 2018, were evaluated using post-event surveys, written reflections/notes during the event, and a survey of HCW in a citywide care collaborative focused on HIV prevention and treatment for LGBTQ + persons that did and did not attend a storytelling event. We analyzed surveys to measure differences in understanding, beliefs and practices and used thematic qualitative analysis of written reflections/notes from the storytelling events. 416 persons attended storytelling events; 124(30 %) completed post-event surveys and 449 56 HCW completed post-event surveys; 49(87.5 %) strongly agreed/agreed they better understood LGBTQ + patients. Emergent themes from the 43 HCW written reflections/notes included improved understanding and new approaches for engaging LGBTQ + patients. Among HCW survey respondents (n = 111), attending an event was associated with significant differences in beliefs (p = 0.024) and practices (p = 0.000) related to LGBTQ + patients. Storytelling events may serve as effective tools for increasing HCW's understanding, beliefs and practices. This strategy may ultimately help decrease anti-LGBTQ + bias, reduce medical distrust and lower barriers to HIV prevention/treatment for LGBTQ + persons.

All of the evaluated social marketing campaigns were developed in collaboration with health department staff, external marketing firms, and community advisory boards (CAB) aiming to produce changes in PrEP outcomes by reaching racial/ethnic and sexual and gender minorities. Jurisdictions demonstrated changes in PrEP awareness, knowledge, willingness to take PrEP, and/or PrEP literacy following initiation of the campaigns. In data from four sites, PrEP awareness significantly increased from 72 % at baseline to 86 % at mid-project, and to 90 % post-campaigns. The campaigns illustrate the importance of partnerships and stakeholder engagement, audience segmentation, and intentional evaluation planning. As PrEP services mature, evaluating PrEP demand and PrEP use resulting from campaigns, will be necessary. Also, future campaigns for racial/ethnic and sexual and gender minorities should identify the best channels to reach each group based on their input, disaggregate data by priority group, and determine campaign effectiveness.

This paper describes an evaluation of a multimedia art installation intended to promote awareness of health disparities as experienced by homeless persons living in Toronto (Canada). The objective of the evaluation was to determine whether the installation had an impact on audience members, and if so, to understand its influence on viewers' perspectives on homelessness and the health concerns of homeless persons. Key themes were identified through the analysis of direct observational data of viewer interactions with the exhibit and qualitative interviews with different audience members after the exhibit. The four key themes were: (1) Promoting recognition of common humanity between viewers and viewed (challenging previously held assumptions and stereotypes, narrowing perceived social distance); (2) functions fulfilled (or potentially fulfilled) by the exhibit: raising awareness, educational applications, and potential pathways by which the exhibit could serve as a call to social action; (3) stories that prompt more stories: the stories within the exhibit (coupled with the interview questions) prompted further sharing of stories amongst the evaluation respondents, highlighting the iterative nature of such approaches. Respondents told of recognizing similarities in the experiences recounted in the exhibit with their own interactions with homeless persons; (4) strengths and weaknesses identified: including aesthetic features, issues of audience 'reach' and the importance of suitable venues for exhibition. Theoretically informed by narrative analysis and visual anthropology, this evaluation demonstrates that arts-informed 'interventions' are highly complex and work in subtle ways on viewers, allowing them to re-imagine the lives of others and identify points of common interest. It also problematizes our assumptions about which outcomes matter and why.

Their level of analysis is often too broad or too narrow, and their aggregated statistical format often means that they represent the conflict-affected area in ways that are meaningless to local communities. This article takes the form of a proposal for a new generation of locally organised indicators that are based in everyday life. These indicators are inspired by practice from sustainable development in which indicators are crowd sourced. There is the potential for these to become 'indicators+' or part of a conflict transformation exercise as communities think about what peace might look like and how it could be realised. The article advocates a form of participatory action research that would be able to pick up the textured 'hidden transcript' found in many deeply divided societies and could allow for better targeted peacebuilding and development assistance.

This study identified factors associated with perspectives of housing services among 29 homeless emerging adults (ages 18-23years) through one-on-one interviews. Data were gathered and analyzed using grounded theory methodology for qualitative information. Major themes of peer support and positive personal and programmatic interactions in the context of emerging adult development were noted as important factors in housing service utilization. These major themes should be taken into consideration for current housing programs, due to homeless emerging adults' oscillation between their desire for formal support and personal independence. Greater emphasis on services that do not require long term commitments and are more flexible in addressing specific barriers to housing for homeless emerging adults may increase use.

This paper evaluates the effectiveness of the introduction of a Writing Center at a university, which aims at improving students' scientific writing abilities. In order to deal with the presumed limited utility of student feedback surveys for evaluating the effectiveness of educational programs, we use students' actual learning outcomes as our quality measure. Based on this objective measure, different statistical evaluation methods established in the labor market treatment literature are applied. We present and discuss the validity of these methods to evaluate educational programs and compare the results of these approaches to implications obtained using corresponding student surveys. Although almost all students reported the writing courses to be helpful, we find no significant effect of course participation on students' grades. This result highlights the need for institutions not to rely solely on student course evaluations for evidence-based policy decisions.

The evaluation methodology was based on prior evaluation resources and local food consumer research. Data were gathered through a web panel survey; 877 respondents completed the survey in June 2010. The results suggest that the program is reaching a wider audience than just those predisposed to local food initiatives. In addition, awareness of Select Nova was related to perceptions of local benefits and barriers, as well as purchase motivation and behavior. Respondents who were aware of Select Nova Scotia rated societal benefits as more important and viewed location and price as less of a barrier; they were also more likely to be highly motivated to purchase local foods. This study also informs results found in previous consumer research studies and identifies marketing opportunities to enhance the effectiveness of local food programs. The results suggest that societal benefits might be used as a way to differentiate products with similar attributes.

A 5-component EBO model is described that provides a framework for the activities involved in selecting, developing, and implementing evidence-based outcomes. Three international examples based on the reliable, valid, and standardized assessment of individual quality of life outcomes are presented that demonstrate how EBOs can be used to improve clinical, managerial, and policy decision making.

This paper describes the systematic adaptation of a U.S.-developed Evidence Based Intervention (EBI) using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Map of Adaption Process for use at a Pediatric Hospital in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The adapted intervention, Supporting Youth and Motivating Positive Action or SYMPA, a six-session risk reduction intervention targeted for youth living with HIV/AIDS (YLWH) in Kinshasa was adapted from the Healthy Living Project and guided by the Social Action Theory. This paper describes the process of implementing the first four steps of the ADAPT framework (Assess, Select, Prepare, and Pilot). Our study has shown that an EBI developed and implemented in the U.S. can be adapted successfully for a different target population in a low-resource context through an iterative process following the CDC ADAPT framework. This process included reviewing existing literature, adapting and adding components, and focusing on increasing staff capacity.

The link between teacher candidates' learning in teacher education programs and pupils' learning in K-12 classrooms implicit in the policy discourse suggests a one-to-one correspondence. However, the logical steps leading from what teacher candidates have learned in their programs to what they are doing in classrooms that may contribute to their pupils' learning are anything but straightforward. In this paper, we argue that the logic model approach from scholarship on evaluation can enhance research on teacher education by making explicit the logical links between program processes and intended outcomes. We demonstrate the usefulness of the logic model approach through our own work on designing a longitudinal study that focuses on examining the process and impact of an undergraduate mathematics and science teacher education program.

Moreover, empirical literature on EU in the context of humanitarian Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) is very limited. The current article focuses on the evaluability assessment (EA) of a West-Africa based humanitarian NGO's progressive evaluation strategy. Since 2007, the NGO has established an evaluation strategy to inform its maternal and child health care user-fee exemption intervention. Using Wholey's (2004) framework, the current EA enabled us to clarify with the NGO's evaluation partners the intent of their evaluation strategy and to design its program logic model. The EA ascertained the plausibility of the evaluation strategy's objectives, the accessibility of relevant data, and the utility for intended users of evaluating both the evaluation strategy and the conditions that foster EU. Hence, key evaluability conditions for an EU study were assured. This article provides an example of EA procedures when such guidance is scant in the literature. It also offers an opportunity to analyze critically the use of EAs in the context of a humanitarian NGO's collaboration with evaluators and political actors. Evaluability assessment; Evaluation use; Humanitarian Non-Governmental Organization (NGO); Africa; equity through theory-informed evaluations: A look at housing first strategies, cross-sectoral health programs, and prostitution policy The emergent realist perspective on evaluation is instructive in the quest to use theory-informed evaluations to reduce health inequities. This perspective suggests that in addition to knowing whether a program works, it is imperative to know 'what works for whom in what circumstances and in what respects, and how?' (Pawson & Tilley, 1997). This addresses the important issue of heterogeneity of effect, in other words, that programs have different effects for different people, potentially even exacerbating inequities and worsening the situation of marginalized groups. But in addition, the realist perspective implies that a program may not only have a greater or lesser effect, but even for the same effect, it may work by way of a different mechanism, about which we must theorize, for different groups. For this reason, theory, and theory-based evaluations are critical to health equity.

Qualitative data from interviews with 154 veterans in peer support programs were analyzed to identify factors promoting program entry and participation. Findings confirm the importance of both internal and external factors for program engagement. Internal factors included feeling a sense of disconnection, dissatisfaction with other programs, emotional needs, concrete needs, and a desire to serve others. External factors included encouragement from others, program culture, and program climate. Implications for program development and evaluation are discussed. While much of the current literature on veterans focuses on individual characteristics promoting or impeding service use, this study provides insight into programmatic features such as culture and climate which foster participation and meaningful engagement. Ultimately, programs serving veterans need input and influence by veterans, and should emphasize peer support and other opportunities for social connection.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic loss of human life worldwide and presents an unprecedented challenge to public health, food systems and the world of work. Conducting evaluation during COVID-19 pandemic was even more challenging as compared to the evaluation in conflict areas. Sudden lockdown and sustained restrictions was unexpected and affected the evaluators plan of actions for the ongoing as well as forthcoming evaluation activities. Not only primary data collection but secondary research also got hampered as access to knowledge resource centres/libraries stopped due to closure of these centres. As far as primary data collection is concerned, not only data collection exercise got stopped but even for those evaluations where data collection had been completed, the electronic data entry of filled-in survey schedules got stalled for a while. The paper discusses the critical components of evaluation, which gets affected during pandemic like situation such as use of participatory evaluation techniques; missing evidence based policy decisions; external and internal validity not ensured or ethical norms get compromised. To overcome such situations, the evaluation world should be ready with the suggested solutions such as, Use of Artificial Intelligence, computer-assisted interviews, capacity building of community members for participatory evaluation and making ethical review of evaluation protocols mandatory.

Patients experience diverse side effects, and difficulties in managing these side effects have been identified as obstacles for treatment continuation. The aim of this study was to describe the development of a support program for patients prescribed ET. Breast cancer; Endocrine therapy; an innovative integrated training for child and youth services: Lessons learned This article highlights one child and youth services agency's journey to develop and pilot a system for tracking training effectiveness for staff. Given the importance of intentional and strong staff training to the success of an agency, the purpose of this study was to report training outcomes across four-time intervals (i.e., immediately after training considered here as baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months) using a tracking system based on best practices in staff development. Results indicated that the tracking system allowed this agency to measure and describe post-training outcomes for staff across the four-time intervals. It can be inferred that such training positively influenced youth outcomes. Specifically, the training and follow-up expanded staff's ability to effectively internalize concepts and be more intentional with their time for the benefit of youth care.

User-centred impact evaluation of an eight-country, community-based early childhood programme This paper presents a unique approach to the Impact Evaluation of a project that focused on low-threshold intergenerational play-based interactions in order to support young children from marginalised communities in eight European countries. The approach builds upon the work of Fetterman's Empowerment Evaluation and Patton's Utilization Focused Evaluation and brings them together to form an adapted model of evaluation. We outline in this paper how these two well developed methods of evaluation have been applied to a real world context, that is, the impact evaluation of a complex international project. Our approach highlights the complexities of differing contexts and allows for surprising and unintended consequences to emerge. It results, through double loop learning, a type of feedback loop with the internal stakeholders and implementers that is useful to the project coordination team, with a view to further upscaling of the initiative. Recommendations for policy at local, national and European Union levels were provided to the project and potential external users. However, the predominant feedback was provided at two crucial points along the way; during a stakeholder mapping exercise and during the further development of monitoring data tools.

In the United States, federal policy outlines several goals designed to guide the development and implementation of state CCA programs, however the intended outcomes are difficult to quantify. Without the collection and analysis of data related to the families and providers involved in the program, states are not able to effectively evaluate their success. This leaves program administrators and community advocates without valuable information needed for decision-making. Administrative data collected by the state CCA programs as part of their implementation offers a low-cost and effective approach to assessing program performance and execution, but there is currently no guidance for distilling the large quantities of information existing in these complex records. In this article, we present a novel evaluation framework for using administrative data to evaluate CCA program success guided by both policy and literature. We illustrate the benefit of our approach using the state of Iowa's CCA data system and offer recommendations for decision-makers seeking to use a data-driven approach to program evaluation.

RRH provides short-term rental assistance for independent scattered-site housing, in addition to an array of support services for approximately 12-24 months. The aim of this study is to explore the experiences of young adults (18-23 years old) who had previously been homeless and who were enrolled in RRH programs set in two urban Northeastern cities, and their subsequent preparedness for independent living. Our sample mostly consisted of non-Hispanic Black females, many of whom identified as LGBTQ. Semi-structured interviews (n = 15) were conducted after participants had been in the program for nine months - three months prior to their initial program completion date. Thematic analysis revealed three themes: the importance of tangible support, communication among all parties: staff lead the way, and \"I gotta start learning to do it on my own\". These domains provided essential assistance for young people to attain their goals and through this process they learned skills to live independently and transition into adulthood. These findings suggest that rapid rehousing programs and service providers should focus on these domains to facilitate successful transition to independent living for this population.

The aim of this study is to explore how action learning processes can strengthen MHP capacity within and across organizations in a community setting. We applied an embedded case study design and a realist evaluation framework to explore key combinations of mechanisms and contextual factors that generated the emergent MHP capacity outcomes of an action learning program, i.e. context-mechanism-outcome-configurations (CMO-configurations). Data consisted of 18 semi-structured face-to-face interviews, 10 telephone interviews, two group interviews, observations, and documents. Interviewees (n = 21) were participants and management employees. Our analytical provision of CMO-configurations provides insights into how contextual factors, such as participant motivation, organizational support, and existing task descriptions, in combination with certain program mechanisms, such as legitimization of specific agendas, learning-by-doing, and collaborations across organizational boundaries, explain the identified outcomes. Outcomes ranged across implementation of MHP initiatives, personal development among participants, and relational and collaborative development. Taken together, our results strengthen the notion that mechanisms of action learning hold the potential to build MHP capacity on an individual, organizational, and community level. This study, also, illustrates that realist evaluation offers a relevant methodology for investigating the underlying workings of capacity building programs.

When implementing development assistance programmes in this context, the risk of unintended consequences tends to be higher as the conflict tends to increase complexity, and typically, FCAS development programmes are designed to deliver benefits only to parties on one side of the conflict. Searching for new insights, a systematic review of 121 documents was used to identify specific types of unintended consequences, their frequency and the nature of management strategies used to address them. Examination of these documents identified aggravation of the conflict and unintended support either for the opposing side's military regime or a non-state actor was the most common unintended consequence. As nearly all assessments only considered the nature of consequences from the donor's viewpoint, we conclude that there may be a case for assessing impacts from the alternative viewpoint - that is, of unsupported parties to the conflict. More generally, we conclude that FCAS programme guidelines would benefit from the development and deployment of more rigorous evaluation methods and the codifying of unintended consequences terminology.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the preference of senior high school students on online learning attributes during the COVID-19 pandemic by utilizing a conjoint analysis approach. Six attributes which consist of delivery type, assigned tasks, evaluation, virtual laboratory, interface layout, and delivery platform were simultaneously analyzed through orthogonal design. A total of 1189 senior high school students were collected via purposive sampling approach through the social media platform. The respondents voluntarily participated and answered 29 stimuli with 2 holdouts generated by using SPSS 25 utilizing a 7-point Likert scale. The results indicated that evaluation was found to be the most significant attribute and followed by virtual laboratory, delivery type, and delivery platform. Interestingly, multiple choice evaluation, not requiring virtual laboratories, mixed delivery type (synchronous with recorded lectures), and MS Teams as delivery platform were considered as the keys for the preference. This study is the first study that utilized a conjoint approach to analyze the senior high school students' preference on the online learning attributes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the conjoint approach can be applied and extended to evaluate the online learning attributes globally by utilizing the attributes and design created in this study.

Yet, while recent scholarship critiques evaluation at the macro level for reproducing societal inequities and calls the profession and individual evaluators to change, this research overlooks evaluation ecosystems - though dynamic interactions among evaluation teams, workplaces, community stakeholders, funders, and informal professional networks form crucial connections between the macro and micro levels and can be spaces for promoting equity within and through evaluations. Addressing this gap, this exploratory study proposes and uses an adapted socioecological framework to organize thematic analysis of data from interviews with evaluators in New England (n = 21) about factors that help and hinder equity-oriented evaluation practices. We identify nine domains and twenty-three factors across macro, meso, and micro levels that influence these evaluators' capacity to practice equity-oriented evaluation in regional, national, and international contexts. The study contributes a framework that future research can adapt to explore the relevance of identified domains and factors to other geographical settings. We also provide questions to guide evaluators, program leaders, and others in reflecting on leverage points for change within their own contexts and outline future directions for research on equity and evaluation.

The purpose of this study was to measure how substance use prevention coalitions in Mexico functioned across their first 1.5 years, and to test associations between initial community contextual factors and subsequent coalition functioning and outcomes. Members of 19 coalitions participated in three waves of surveys about coalition context and functioning. We used paired t-tests to assess changes in coalition functioning and outcomes. Regression models estimated associations between coalition functioning and outcomes and initial community context. Among coalition functioning factors, over coalitions' first 1.5 years, member engagement increased, as did coordinator skill and participatory leadership style. Two initial community context factors - community support for prevention and community champions - predicted several measures of process competence, but only community champions predicted perceived community improvement. Thus, community champions may play a pivotal role in later coalition success. The observed increases in member engagement and process competence may support subsequent coalition sustainability, a crucial component to realizing their potential impact on public health.

In order to strengthen and expand the Illinois Asthma Partnership (IAP), external evaluators determined the degree to which local rates of Pediatric Asthma Related Emergency Department (PARED) visits aligned with local hospital Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNA), asthma prioritization, and IAP engagement. The majority of counties with high PARED rates also had high levels of concentrated disadvantage. Combining these data enabled identification of 15 out of 102 counties where PARED visits were high and the program was not engaged. In these counties, there was an opportunity for the IAP to assist. Potential actions in these counties could include identification of a local asthma champion and development of a new program, actions to raise community awareness of asthma, and engagement with health care community leaders to discuss perceptions of need and competing priorities. This study provided a unique and cost-effective way of utilizing easily accessible data in order to plan the expansion of the IAP.

Knowledge and skills gaps among these stakeholders are noted as the most critical factors affecting food safety systems in developing countries. Competent professionals who can help identify and address those gaps either by themselves or by informing and educating others are critical to improve food safety situations. Within these contexts, Michigan State University (MSU) held a week-long food safety short course virtually in November 2020. A descriptive study employing web surveys was administered to study the effectiveness of and lessons-learned from this course. Thirty-seven out of 42 participants attending the food safety short course filled out pre-and post-course surveys. The findings revealed a significantly higher level of knowledge of participants on the topics taught compared to their knowledge prior to the course. Participants appreciated the course management, course contents, and course offering, however, they preferred this course to be offered in person providing opportunities for hands-on learning and interactions with faculty and professionals and visits to the food processing industries.

From this perspective, investing in projects or organizations aligned with the principles of circularity can be characterized as impact investments. However, a challenge that emerges for these investments that is gaining increasing prominence in the academic and corporate environment is related to the development of an efficient evaluation model concerning its real impact on business. Based on the Theory of Change and in the context of circular business models, this paper aims at proposing an integrative tool to evaluate impact investments and applying it to a circular business of the home appliance segment. The articulation between the ToC and circular business models can support the structuring of an evaluation model on the production logic of the desired (economic, environmental, and social) impact. Results present that an integrative tool can provide a way for companies, institutions and investors to compare the impact investment opportunities related to Circular Business Model. Circular economy; Circular business model; Evaluation; Theory Effectiveness of strategy implementation and e-governance performance E-governance projects generally face many planning and implementation related challenges. It is well acknowledged that the complexities involved ask for adequate strategic planning before launching these projects. However, it is observed that many times even the well-planned e-governance projects may not perform as per expectations due to ineffective strategy implementation. This could perhaps be one of the causes of the unsatisfactory performance of e-governance projects, particularly in the context of developing countries, as reported by some studies. The article attempts to analyze the effectiveness of strategy implementation and performance of e-governance based on a study of a few agriculture related e-governance projects in India. Suitable measures and hypotheses have been conceptualized for studying the effectiveness of strategy implementation and e-governance performance. The empirical support is provided by a survey of operational level officers involved in the implementation of projects. The analysis has brought out four constituents of the construct 'effectiveness of strategy implementation' which has been revealed as a predictor of 'performance of e-governance'. The study findings are expected to contribute in terms of giving more thrust to identified factors of strategy implementation while planning for e-governance initiatives. The findings may also trigger corrective actions in several such ongoing projects which are struggling to deliver the intended outcomes. Overall, the research based interventions by practitioners may lead to better performance of e-governance projects for the benefit of society at large.

The effective use of resources is a crucial issue in Chile's higher education reform. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) has been widely applied to measure efficiency in universities, sometimes focused on teaching or research. Universities function as a complex production process in which teaching and research are linked in the internal structure, share some inputs, and continue across multiple periods. To deal with this complexity, we developed a new DEA model that incorporates network structures, carryover activities, and shared inputs in a dynamic approach. We applied this model to a set of 33 Chilean universities and compared the results to their rankings and accreditation status. Our proposed DEA model has advantages: (a) there are no subjective criteria, and (b) the model considers the internal structure of the university production model, as well as the inputs and outputs over time. The objectivity of the model allows us to evaluate overall efficiency in terms of the quantity and quality of teaching and research, removing exogenous criteria and judgments regarding the performance of higher education institutions. This new quantitative approach could generate disaggregated data to analyze efficiency improvement over time or serve as a benchmarking tool according to the universities' and the co-creation of an evaluation framework for Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) implementation: a two-country experience Persistent gaps exist in healthcare workers' capacity to address HIV and tuberculosis in Asia and Africa due to constraints in resources and knowledge. Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) leverages video-enabled technology to build workforce capacity and promote collaboration through mentorship and case-based learning. To understand current perceptions of ECHO participants and develop a comprehensive evaluation framework for ECHO implementation, we utilized modified appreciative inquiry guided focus group discussions (FGD) in India and Tanzania and called it SCORE (Strengths, Challenges, Opportunities, Results, and Evaluation). Content and thematic analysis of transcripts from FGDs and key-informant interviews triangulated perceptions of diverse stakeholders about ECHO implementation and identified key elements for development of the framework. The perceived strengths (S) were capacity building and establishing communities of practice. The perceived challenges (C) included securing resources, engaging leadership, and building systems for monitoring impact. Improved internet connectivity, addressing logistical challenges, encouraging session interactivity, and having strategic scale-up plans were perceived opportunities (O). Additionally, gathering measurable results (R) led to development of a comprehensive evaluation (E) framework. Contextualizing and facilitating SCORE with qualitative analysis of findings 6-12 months post-ECHO implementation may serve as a best practice to assess mid-course corrections to improve ECHO implementation quality.

Worldwide cause 71% deaths, in Mexico during 2016 were the cause of 80% of registered deaths; population in socioeconomic disadvantage is more vulnerable. It is urgent to develop strategies that can prevent NCD, thus, the objective of this study was to design, implement and evaluate an educational intervention strategy (EI), to prevent and control risk factors for the development NCD in families of two vulnerable communities. The research design was mixed, the stages were developed based on a risk communication (RC) model and was performed in three stages: 1) EI Design, 2) Implementation and 3) Evaluation of the intervention. In the contextualization, risk factors were found in the participants who were integrated in the design of the educational strategy. The EI implemented was effective in increasing knowledge about NCD and practice of healthy habits, such as increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables. Additionally, the guidance of EI at the family level has the advantage of creating a support network for these changes. However, pending issues remain, such as the design of effective strategies to reduce the consumption of sugars and sugary drinks.

The program was notable for being one of a relatively small number of comprehensive DBT programs in the VA system, and for including patients with psychosis and psychotic disorder, with a majority of patients (58%) having a documented history of psychosis or endorsing psychotic symptoms in assessments. We describe the process of creating this program at a VA medical center and present preliminary program evaluation data. All patients completed assessments of suicidality (C-SSRS), emotion dysregulation (DERS), skills use and dysfunctional coping (DBT-WCCL), borderline symptomatology (BSL-23), and depression (PHQ-9) at program entry and subsequently every 6-8 weeks through program completion. Suicide attempts and hospitalizations were also tracked. Twelve patients completed multiple (up to six) assessment timepoints, allowing for evaluation of change during treatment. Patients demonstrated improvements on most measures and no hospitalizations or suicide attempts during active treatment, and the subsample with psychosis showed average improvements on every outcome measure. Eleven of 12 patients completed a full six-month rotation.

The effectiveness of the program was evaluated through various data collection methods (i.e. focus group discussions, questionnaires, and semi-structured interviews) taking into account the perspectives of teachers, supervisors, and teacher educators. Besides, the possible effects of the program on students' foreign language achievement were investigated. The results of evaluations indicated that although needs-based peer-coached TPDPs were more likely to consolidate English teachers' knowledge, improve their teaching practices, and promote students' academic achievement, teacher education policy-makers and professional development (PD) designers/providers in Iran still followed more traditional approaches, keeping teachers in isolation and not allowing the exchange of ideas to take place among them. The results provide insights for and offer practical suggestions to education policy-makers and TPDP designers/providers in many developing countries including Iran to avoid future failures and discouraging outcomes due to the provision of improper TPDPs that do not take into account the actual professional needs of the teachers.

Understanding the mechanisms of action of an intervention focused on daily activities and health from the perspective of participants Evaluation of a complex healthcare intervention should include careful exploration of the mechanisms through which it brings about change. This paper describes a qualitative evaluation of the Redesigning Daily Occupations (ReDO\u00ae-10) programme as it was implemented for the first time with women with stress-related issues in a primary care setting in Ireland. The ReDO\u00ae-10 is a 10-week group intervention designed to support participants make changes to their daily activity patterns to have a more satisfying and balanced daily life. Fourteen women were interviewed after completing the programme. The aim was to explore changes that participants perceived they experienced and to understand how the content of ReDO\u00ae-10 was thought to bring about this change (if it did). Directed content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data using the Behaviour Change Wheel and Theoretical Domains Framework as a coding framework. Overall, four BCW functions of ReDO\u00ae -10 were identified: Education, Persuasion, Modelling and Enablement. Participants described improved belief in their own capabilities, knowledge and goals around life changes. Many behaviour changes were also described, particularly in relation to doing more restorative activities in daily life. Behaviour change techniques that were identified as important for change were practicing new, restorative occupations in group sessions and as homework and the use of self-analysis activities to understand the relationship between activities and health for these participants. Modelling, support and other effects of group dynamics were also vital in changes that occurred.

Participants rated their interactions with the network very highly, and they accessed a wide variety of resources from the network. Finally, participants reported a variety of systems-level outcomes associated with TA Network support. Together, these findings underscore the importance of structuring TA systems to tailor support to fit with recipients' needs, build positive, proactive relationships, and offer services of sufficient dosage. Given the lack of rigorous evaluations on provision of TA, future studies can confirm the degree to which such tailored approaches to TA result in increased satisfaction, more effective implementation of SOC principles, and ultimately improved outcomes for youth and families.

Indigenous methodologies include knowledge and data that are inclusive of historically marginalized groups, are highly meaningful, valid, and useful for all. A paradigm shift from Western evaluation methodologies to Indigenous evaluation is necessary when evaluating STEM programs that are committed to increasing recruitment, retention, and graduation of students from historically marginalized groups. This paper describes the use of the Indigenous Evaluation Framework during the first two years of the newly created Environmental Stewardship of Indigenous Lands program at the University of Colorado Denver. We discuss the importance of the Indigenous Evaluation Framework and how it informs the development and continued improvements to the program that also provides agency to program leads and participants.

The challenges to conducting high-quality evaluations are exacerbated by historical issues of inequity and systemic racism that are pervasive in the United States and globally. We reviewed the literature on culturally responsive approaches to evaluation to propose a culturally responsive evaluation framework and consider its application in EE. This framework helps EE organizations and evaluators consider how issues of race, power, privilege, and inequity influence the evaluation process and the validity of evaluation findings. Implementing this framework may be resource-intensive, but it has the potential to improve evaluation processes and produce actionable results to further address issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the field of EE. We call for organizations that support EE efforts to recognize the importance of this approach, and provide adequate resources to encourage its implementation.

Patients consider hospital websites as highly important sources for health information and services. As a number of health institutes are carrying out projects to improve their websites, the need to design proper assessment means to measure whether they have achieved or are going to achieve their targets arises. Proper assessment of these websites gives us crucial information on the kind of changes needed to make them successful. To satisfy this need, an instrument called Health Sector Website Assessment Index (HSWAI) was developed, integrating the assessment of content, services, community interaction and technology features criteria, under a multi-indicator approach. Many of the considered indicators could be used to monitor progress towards the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3, which is the United Nations health-focused goal. The purpose of this study is to highlight the challenges of developing and applying the assessment instrument for health institute websites. The paper covers key issues and challenges in conceiving, designing, developing, refining and validating HSWAI, and finally in applying it to a set of Portuguese health institutes. The results of this study could provide several insights and recommendations to e-Government assessment researchers and practitioners at the national and agency levels on the development of relative e-Government assessment tools. Studies such as the current one, apart from presenting applied solutions and relative lessons learned, are valuable to the conceptualization and application of present and future e-Government assessment initiatives, regardless of the sector where the effort occurs. E-Government; article Healthy Summer Learners: An explanatory mixed methods study and process evaluation Healthy Summer Learners (HSL), a novel, 6-week summer program for 2-4th grade children from low-income families in the Southeastern United States, aimed to prevent accelerated summer BMI gain and academic learning loss by providing healthy meals and snacks, 15 min of nutrition education, 3 h of physical activity opportunities and 3.5 h of reading instruction daily. This three-armed pilot quasi-experimental study used a repeated measure within- and between-participant design to compare HSL, to an active comparator\u201421st Century Summer Learning Program (21 C), and no-treatment control. A mixed-methods process evaluation was employed to evaluate program implementation and provide insight for future program development. Though the program was well received, student attendance was lower than anticipated and full program fidelity was not achieved. During interviews, both parents and teachers noted that the bussing schedule was inconsistent, making attendance difficult for some families. These process evaluation findings may help explain why no statistically significant group-by-time interactions at 3- or 12-month follow up were found for the primary outcomes of zBMI or MAP reading score. Future iterations of HSL should seek to extend program hours, lengthen program duration, and explore ways to lower projected cost of attendance.

Substance use, mental illness, health disparities, and barriers to treatment can contribute to women clients' unsuccessful completion of probation. The current study describes a process evaluation of the pilot Female Offenders Can Ultimately Succeed (FOCUS) program, which aimed to meet women probation clients' complex needs and improve their probation outcomes. Two women FOCUS Probation Officers had smaller-than-typical caseloads of 132 Medium- to Greatest-Risk women clients and received ongoing training in motivational and trauma-specific supervision strategies. To facilitate linkage to all needed treatment and social services, clients were referred to a primary care Transitions Clinic. Comparing non-FOCUS to FOCUS women clients with Violations of Probation, FOCUS clients had more successful completions of probation (higher non-punitive Restorations of Probation and lower punitive Revocations of Probation). At the Transitions Clinic, 52% of FOCUS clients received treatment. FOCUS clients and stakeholders provided narrative feedback reflecting a range of experiences in FOCUS, guiding future program implementation efforts. Promising outcomes from FOCUS demonstrate the potential of theory-based supervision and probation-medical collaboration to facilitate women clients' success in probation.

This action represented a significant investment of resources, such as staff time and organisational funds, and demonstrates SDN's strong commitment to research and evaluation as a means of supporting organisational learning and development. This paper highlights the innovative nature of the approach by positioning the role of the embedded researcher within the current theoretical and socio-political context. It also provides evidence of the success of the approach by reporting on the findings of a study that investigated staff's experiences of being involved in this type of collaborative investigation of their work.

Research has documented program successes and plans for replication have proliferated, yet very little is known about how the Proposition 36 program works or practices for achieving optimal program outcomes. In this article, we identify policies and practices that key stakeholders perceive to be most responsible for the successful delivery of court-supervised substance abuse treatment to offenders under Proposition 36. Data was collected via focus groups conducted with 59 county stakeholders in six high-performing counties during 2009. Discussion was informed by seven empirical indicators of program performance and outcomes and was focused on identifying and describing elements contributing to success. Program success was primarily attributed to four strategies, those that: (1) fostered program engagement, monitored participant progress, and sustained cooperation among participants; (2) cultivated buy-in among key stakeholders; (3) capitalized on the role of the court and the judge; and (4) created a setting which promoted a high-quality treatment system, utilization of existing resources, and broad financial and political support for the program. Goals and practices for implementing each strategy are discussed. Findings provide a \"promising practices\" resource for Proposition 36 program evaluation and improvement and inform the design and study of other similar types of collaborative justice treatment efforts.

It focuses on three types of impacts - environmental quality, health and wider economic impacts - to examine how transportation project evaluation methods have evolved in recent years and how they compare to methods used for evaluation of non-transportation programs. Examples of recent practice are provided to show how transport agencies are continuing to refine performance measures to include broader impacts in project evaluation. A classification is provided to distinguish direct traveler effects from indirect effects on non-travelers, a step important to maximize coverage and minimize double-counting of impacts. For each type of impact, the paper discusses the range of variation in monetized values and shows that the variation is due less to imprecision in measurement than to fundamental issues about whether to use damage compensation, impact avoidance costs, stated preferences or behavioral valuation perspectives to define those values. Case studies as diverse as Australian roads, Wisconsin energy programs and Appalachian economic development programs are used to show how common methods are evolving among transport and non-transport agencies to improve impact measurement and its use in project evaluation.

In order to optimize evaluative outcomes, the author suggests an approach based on ideas borrowed from the science of cybernetics as a method of evaluation--one that enables in-depth perception of the evaluated field without jeopardizing a rigorous study or the evaluator's professionalism. The paper focuses on the main concepts that deal with this dilemma - showing how cybernetics combines the different bodies of knowledge of the different stakeholders, including the professional evaluator, resulting in a coherent body of knowledge created mainly by those internal to the process, owned by them, and relevant to all - those who are internal and those who are external and their different purposes.

An updated definition and values and principles are proposed, and the importance of always presenting the definition along with the accompanying specification of the philosophy is emphasized in order to increase its utility in assisting the field to move from theory to practice.

Using this narrow population definition excludes the other 80-90% of the youth who have mental health challenges but have not risen to the highest level of need. If all children and their families receive the right amount of support from the system of care at the right time, they will avoid the need for more intensive and expensive services and supports later. This public health approach helps to build more stable communities and redirects scarce resources to interventions that are less costly than those needed for youth who already have developed serious emotional disturbances. The key to successfully supplying the \"right amount at the right time\" is to ensure that the system of care is truly needs driven, rather than agency or service system driven. A system of care for children, youth and their families should reflect community preferences and embrace a public health approach where all levels of need are served.

This paper presents an evaluation of the Integrated Services Centre (ISC) Pilot Project that was conducted in Australia in 2007 and early 2008. The purpose of the ISC program was to provide integrated support to humanitarian refugees in settlement, physical health, mental health and employment. The Pilot Project was based in two primary schools in Perth, Western Australia. The evaluation utilized a flexible qualitative [`]engaged' methodology and included interviews, focus groups and telephone interviews with the key stakeholders, project staff and a small number of refugee families. The strength of the qualitative methodology (including data that is narrative rich) is that it highlights issues as perceived by each stakeholder and provides insights into the daily work by ISC staff that helped to uncover unintended outcomes. Despite the fact that the ISC evaluation was supposed to be a [`]before and after' design, the researchers acknowledge a common weakness in many evaluations (including the ISC) that when baseline data is required, evaluators are recruited after the project has begun. This issue is discussed in the paper. It is critical that independent evaluators are able to begin collecting baseline data as soon as programs are launched, if not before.

This paper presents definitions for four different types of sustainability as potential outcomes of health programs. We then illustrate these definitions with descriptive findings from an on-line survey to \"look back\" at the extent and types of sustainability that occurred among 48 community-based projects that had received short-term funding from a foundation-funded health program in New Jersey. We found that large percentages of respondents reported positively to each of four types of sustainability measures--maintaining program activities, continuing to serve substantial numbers of clients, building and sustaining collaborative structures, and maintaining attention to the ideas underlying the projects by disseminating them to others. Strengths and limitations of this methodology for future evaluation are also discussed.

Responsive evaluation facilitates a dialogical process by creating social conditions that enhance equal input from all stakeholders. However, when multiple stakeholders are involved, some groups tend to go unheard or not be taken seriously. In these cases, empowerment of the more silent voices is needed. The inclusion of marginalized groups in evaluation is thus a challenge for evaluators. It raises questions about how to include all stakeholders in the evaluation process in a way that empowers marginalized stakeholder groups, and at the same time is acceptable for the dominant stakeholder groups. In this article we describe our experiences with a responsive evaluation project on the participation of client councils in policy processes in a Dutch residential care and nursing home organization. We focus on the value of hermeneutic dialogue (fostering mutual understanding and learning processes) in addressing the challenges of working with stakeholders in unequal relationships.

Whaley (2003) developed a cognitive-cultural model of identity to explicate the process by which ethnic-racial socialization impacts ethnic-racial identity and subsequent social and behavioral outcomes among adolescents of African descent. The present study tests the cognitive-cultural model of identity utilizing pilot data from a modified Africentric intervention program. Both explicit and implicit aspects of ethnic-racial identity were evaluated between two cohorts: one group in 2003, which represented historical controls, and another group in 2008 which received the intervention and has pre-test and post-test data. We hypothesized that the evaluation of underlying implicit or schematic processes would be more sensitive to changes in ethnic-racial identity resulting from cohort and intervention effects. Our results confirmed this hypothesis. Implications of applying mainstream behavioral science research paradigms to issues of special concern to the Black community are discussed.

The analysis was aimed at getting indications for neighbourhood improvement, which can lead to residential satisfaction and neighbourhood attachment. We considered both constructs as the result of the relationships between the physical attributes of the environment, the cognitive perceptions and the affective appraisals of residents, and the activities they carry out. The role of socio-demographic and residential variables was also considered. Theoretical implications of results and indications for neighbourhood improvement are discussed. Residential satisfaction and neighbourhood attachment have a different pattern of predictors, emerging from all the dimensions of analysis we considered. Using hierarchical linear models, cognitive, affective and behavioural variables emerged as significant first-level predictors of both criterions, and physical attributes were found to be significant second-level predictors. In addition, the joint analysis of objective neighbourhood features and residents' experience within a place-specific framework showed to be an effective approach to identify relevant domains for neighbourhood improvement. Commercial and leisure facilities can contribute to make the neighbourhood more lively; building density and green areas have inverse effects on the prevalence of social activities.

Many reports are cursory, however, and few, if any, fully portray the long and winding path taken when developing evaluation instruments, particularly observation instruments. In this article, we describe the development of an observational method for evaluating the degree to which K-12 inquiry science programs are implemented, including the many steps and decisions that occurred during the development, and present evidence for the reliability and validity of the data that we collected with the instrument. The article introduces a method for measuring the adherence of inquiry science implementation and gives evaluators a full picture of what they might expect when developing observation instruments for assessing the degree of program implementation. 3 2008 31 8 247 258 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149-7189(08)00018-9 Brandon, P.R.

In this article I make a case for adopting a cost-utility approach, illustrating the argument with data generated in a NA of central library services in a Canadian school district. Using survey data from eight stakeholder groups, I found that (1) NAs based on the service preferences of a single stakeholder group can be misleading; (2) service preferences can be integrated into a single set of priorities, even when there are disagreements, by using the stakeholder group as the unit of analysis and assigning weights that privilege input from knowledgeable respondents; and (3) that the ranking of service operations produced by user preferences was not significantly correlated with the ranking produced by integrating preferences with costs. Cost-utility analysis would be more helpful if the utilities represented rigorously determined benefits of the services assessed, as well as stakeholder perceptions of the value of these benefits. Cost-utility analysis in NA will not reach its potential until cost considerations are routinely included in educational program evaluations.

The ten steps are a combination of the usual recommended practice such as developing program theory and implementing rigorous evaluation designs with a stronger focus on more unconventional steps including developing learning frameworks, exploring pathways of evaluation influence, and assessing spread and sustainability. Consideration of these steps can lead to a focused dialogue between program planners and evaluators and can result in more rigorously planned programs. The ten steps can also help in developing and implementing evaluation designs that have greater potential for policy and programmatic influence. The paper argues that there is a need to go beyond a formulaic approach to program evaluation design that often does not address the complexity of the programs. The complexity of the program will need to inform the design of the evaluation. The ten steps that are described in this paper are heavily informed by a Realist approach to evaluation. The Realist approach attempts to understand what is it about a program that makes it work.

At a time when the need for such evaluations is growing, health care professionals have limited information on the methodological challenges of performing these evaluations. In this study, we used the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program to illustrate these potential underlying variations. We performed site visits to four grantees and collected activity-based cost data from nine additional representative programs. We identified five specific types of cost factors that should be considered when evaluating and comparing health care programs: clinical services, service mix, in-kind contributions, indirect costs, and year-to-year expenditures of specific activities. A key lesson is that case studies and pilot testing should be performed before initiating cost analysis to identify underlying variation and to test appropriate methods to adequately control for these differences. 2 2008 31 5 136 144 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149-7189(08)00009-8 Subramanian, Sujha Ekwueme, Caren oai:RePEc:eee:epplan:v:12:y:1989:i:3:p:271-2782019-08-10RePEc:eee:epplan article Steps toward a multifactorial satisfaction scale for primary care and mental health services, 3 1989 12 1 271 278 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0149-7189(89)90038-4 Greenfield, Thomas K.

A key factor in this study was the acceptance by program stakeholders to conduct the evaluation using a utilization-focused evaluation approach to promote usability and accuracy of evaluation results. Using a quasi-experimental non-equivalent group design, more than 2000 students in participating classrooms throughout Montana received a pre-survey, post-survey and an extended post-survey; 114 teachers participated in an Internet survey and 16 program instructors took part in a structured open-ended telephone interview. The participatory approach and mixed methods enhanced abilities to interpret results of student surveys in particular. The user-focused approach was discovered to be personal and situational, allowed the facilitation of the evaluation process with consideration for increased application of evaluation findings and implementation of recommendations from beginning to end. Further development of evaluation pathways is needed to more effectively evaluate outcomes and implement practical and transferable measures to determine if environmental education activities produce desired participant outcomes.

In an effort to help evaluators bridge the gap between the potential for high quality evaluation systems to improve environmental education, and the low level of evaluation in actual practice, we reviewed recent environmental education literature to reveal the challenges and opportunities for evaluating environmental education programs. The literature review identified strategies for confronting the challenges in environmental education evaluation, as well as notable opportunities for increasing the quality of evaluation in environmental education.

This paper analyzes the Alameda-Contra Costa (AC) Transit District's five alternative fare proposals introduced for public discussion in March 2005. The proposals combined fare hikes, base fare reductions, eliminations of free transfers, and discontinuation of periodic passes. Using the agency's 2002 on-board survey data, the study assessed the impacts of individual fare proposals on different subsets of riders and evaluated if they were equitable; and estimated potential fare revenues, using alternative price elasticities to estimate changes in ridership due to changes in price. The analysis revealed that proposals that increased the cost of transfers or eliminated unlimited-use passes produced dramatically unequal impacts on certain riders. Proposals for flat fares per ride were found to be least equitable, even when the base fare was lowered, because lower income riders, youth, and minorities made more trips and transferred more frequently than their more affluent counterparts. Proposals that maintained existing pass instruments and allowed transfers for small fees were the most favorable. The paper demonstrates the utility of on-board surveys and details an approach that could be widely used for evaluation of equity in public transit and other areas.

A survey was conducted among 95 members of A-BVs in Zanjan province, Iran. To collect data, a questionnaire was designed. Two distinct groups of A-BVs with low (group 1) and high (group 2) perceived (evaluated) levels of effectiveness were revealed. The study showed that there were significant differences between the two groups on important characteristics of A-BVs and their members. The study also found that there were statistically significant relationships between A-BVs' governance structure and capacity, management and organization characteristics and the perceived effectiveness, whereas there were no statistically significant relationships between A-BVs' advisory methods characteristic applied by members and the perceived effectiveness. Logistic regression results also showed that level of application of rules encouraging members' active participation in important decision makings, clear terms of reference to guide contracting procedures, roles, and responsibilities of parties involved, type of people served and geographical area of program coverage, and members' ability to use Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) were predictors of the perceived (evaluated) effectiveness of A-BVs. The study showed that evaluation of members of effectiveness of A-BVs would not be the same. It is suggested that Iranian public agricultural extension organization, as responsible organization for monitoring and evaluating services conducted by A-BVs, considered these differences between members with different levels of some important variables.

We conducted phone surveys with a representative sample of directors (N=375), teachers (N=1145) and parents (N=625), and we collected more in-depth data through interviews and focus groups in 16 of these schools. The results indicate that access to the reports is not an obstacle to use for school actors, but it is for parents. While summative ratings of the reports in terms of their clarity and utility were generally very positive, the actual recall and interpretation of even basic information (assessed through case scenarios) was incorrect for a majority of teachers and parents, and reported uses of the information were both intended and unintended in nature. We also found some statistically significant differences regarding comprehension and use among subgroups of our sample. Our findings are especially relevant given the expectations attached to the use of the reports for school improvement on the one hand, and parents' behavior as critical consumers of education on the other hand.

However, the major criticism to this approach is the lack of scientific grounded evaluation methods to assess development and implementation of this type of research. This paper describes the process of development and implementation of a participatory evaluation framework within a CBPR program to reduce breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer disparities between African Americans and whites in Alabama and Mississippi as well as lessons learned. The participatory process involved community partners and academicians in a fluid process to identify common ground activities and outcomes. The logic model, a lay friendly approach, was used as the template and clearly outlined the steps to be taken in the evaluation process without sacrificing the rigorousness of the evaluation process. We have learned three major lessons in this process: (1) the importance of constant and open dialogue among partners; (2) flexibility to make changes in the evaluation plan and implementation; and (3) importance of evaluators playing the role of facilitators between the community and academicians. Despite the challenges, we offer a viable approach to evaluation of CBPR programs focusing on cancer disparities.

A secondary objective was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Perceived Improvement Questionnaire (PIQ).Data sources/study setting Two hundred and thirty-two clients of a methadone maintenance treatment program filled out self-reported questionnaires and two open-ended questions measuring their perceived improvement and their level of satisfaction with the services received.Principal findings Correlation analyses revealed a significant relationship between participants' perceived improvement and their level of satisfaction with services received throughout their treatment. A factor analysis identified 3 sub-scales of the PIQ: emotional health, social relations and physical health. The PIQ's internal consistency and construct validity supported the adequacy of the metric properties of the questionnaire.Conclusion Further research is needed to investigate the link between clients' input and treatment satisfaction in different substance abuse populations. The scale's potential to provide valuable information such as clinical assessment and program evaluation should be explored.

At the same time, child welfare agencies are faced with the challenge of providing services to an increasingly diverse population of children and families. As a result, there is a need for evidence-based practice models that respond to these challenges and promote positive outcomes for children and families. This paper describes the development of a program designed to train child welfare staff on the application of an existing evidence-based framework, systems of care, to practice with immigrant Latino children and families as a means of responding to these multiple calls for systems change and practice improvement. Immigrant Latino children and families represent the largest and fastest-growing population in the United States, and thus require the attention of child welfare systems and the development of evidence-based practices designed to respond to the unique needs of this population. Recommendations for program planners and evaluators on the application of systems of care to child welfare practice with immigrant Latino children and families are provided.

Through literature reviews and experts who have real practical experiences in extension education, adequate performance evaluation indices have been selected and then utilizing the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and analytic network process (ANP), respectively, further establishes the causality between the four BSC perspectives as well as the relative weights between evaluation indices. According to this previous result, an empirical analysis of the performance evaluation of extension education centers of three universities at Taoyuan County in Taiwan is illustrated by applying VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR). From the analysis results, it indicates that \"Learning and growth\" is the significant influential factor and it would affect the other three perspectives. In addition, it is discovered that \"Internal process\" perspective as well as \"Financial\" perspective play important roles in the performance evaluation of extension education centers. The top three key performance indices are \"After-sales service\", \"Turnover volume\", and \"Net income\". The proposed evaluation model could be considered as a reference for extension education centers in universities to prioritize their improvements on the key performance indices after performing VIKOR analyses.

The framework guides the process of identifying and explaining operative relationships and perspectives within human service program systems. Self-Determination Theory exemplifies how a foundational theory can be used to support the framework in a wide range of program evaluations. Two examples illustrate how applications of the framework have improved the evaluators' abilities to observe and explain program effect. In both exemplars improvements involved addressing and organizing into a single logic model heretofore seemingly disparate evaluation issues regarding valuing (by whose values); the role of organizational and program context; and evaluation anxiety and utilization.

Concurrently, research on the effects of evaluation has evolved significantly. Recently, one type of result has been the object of particular attention: the effects and lessons directly attributable to the evaluative process, or process use. Analyses generally underline the direct link between participatory approaches and this type of result. However, few empirical studies testing this concept are available. Our analysis aims to enrich evaluative research on this theme and is founded on a case study of a participatory evaluation project on practices carried out in a social services organization (Centre Jeunesse de Qu\u00e9bec - Institut universitaire [Qu\u00e9bec Youth Centre - University Institute, Canada]). The results of our analysis show that the evaluative process favours participant learning and has had several direct and indirect effects on the practices of the involved clinical teams. The results also demonstrate the existence of a link between the intensity of actor participation (individuals, groups) and process use. Both constraining factors and factors favourable to participation and the development of the evaluative process are identified, and avenues for improvement are suggested to accentuate the effects of process use.

This paper deals with the implementation of a program designed to improve the acculturation of immigrant families in Spain (EU). Implementation followed a process that has proved successful in other settings, but is being applied here for the first time. Qualitative and quantitative measures are employed to assess each stage of implementation, with a particular emphasis on fidelity to program design. The intent was to guide effective revision of the program, and to establish it in a form that can be implemented on a larger scale.

However, several challenges impede developing and implementing performance measurement systems at the federal level, including the complexity of public health problems that reflect multiple determinants and involve outcomes that may take years to achieve, the decentralized and networked nature of public health program implementation, and the lack of reliable and consistent data sources and other issues related to measurement. All three of these challenges hinder the ability to attribute program results to specific public health program efforts. The purpose of this paper is to explore these issues in detail and offer potential solutions that support the development of robust and practical performance measures to meet the needs for program improvement and accountability. Adapting performance measurement to public health programs is both an evolving science and art. Through the strategies presented here, appropriate systems can be developed and monitored to support the production of meaningful data that will inform effective decision making at multiple levels.

However, evaluators are in a privileged position because they have access to information from a wide range of sources and can play an important role in helping stakeholders to hear and appreciate one another's opinions and ideas. Indeed, in some cases a difference in perspective can be utilised by an evaluator to engage key stakeholders in fruitful discussion that can add value to the evaluation outcome. In other instances the evaluator finds that the task of facilitating positive interaction between multiple stakeholders is just [`]an uphill battle' and so conflict, rather than consensus, occurs as the evaluation findings emerge and are debated. As noted by Owen [(2006) Program evaluation: Forms and approaches (3rd ed.). St. Leonards, NSW: Allen & Unwin] and other eminent evaluators before him [Fetterman, D. M. (1996). Empowerment evaluation: An introduction to theory and practice. In D. M. Fetterman, S. J. Kaftarian, & A. Wandersman (Eds.), Empowerment evaluation: Knowledge and tools for self-assessment (pp. 3-46). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications; Patton, M. Q. (1997). Utilization-focused evaluation (3rd ed.). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications; Stake, R. A. (1983). Stakeholder influence in the evaluation of cities-in-schools. New Directions for Program Evaluation, 17, 15-30], conflict in an evaluation process is not unexpected. The challenge is for evaluators to facilitate dialogue between people who hold strongly opposing views, with the aim of helping them to achieve a common understanding of the best way forward. However, this does not imply that consensus will be reached [Guba, E. G., & Lincoln, Y. S. (1989). Fourth generation evaluation. Newbury Park, CA: Sage]. What is essential is that the evaluator assists the various stakeholders to recognise and accept their differences and be willing to move on. But the problem is that evaluators are not necessarily equipped with the technical or personal skills required for effective negotiation. In addition, the time and effort that are required to undertake this mediating role are often not sufficiently understood by those who commission a review. With such issues in mind Markiewicz, A. [(2005). A balancing act: Resolving multiple stakeholder interests in program evaluation. Evaluation Journal of Australasia, 4(1-2), 13-21] has proposed six principles upon which to build a case for negotiation to be integrated into the evaluation process. This paper critiques each of these principles in the context of an evaluation undertaken of a youth program. In doing so it challenges the view that stakeholder consensus is always possible if program improvement is to be achieved. This has led to some refinement and further extension of the proposed theory of negotiation that is seen to be instrumental to the role of an evaluator. 3 2008 31 8 259 265 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149-7189(08)00029-3 McDonald, Diane oai:RePEc:eee:epplan:v:18:y:1995:i:3:p:219-2252019-08-10RePEc:eee:epplan article Homeless mentally ill clients and the quality of life 3 1995 18 219 225 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149-7189(95)00016-X Calsyn, Robert J.

The study is described followed by a discussion of the difficulties in participant recruitment and selection, sample size, instrumentation, data collection and analysis and attempts to resolve them. Some of these problems are generic to the Delphi whereas others related to the specifics of the investigation.

The intent of the survey was twofold. First, the survey was designed to collect comprehensive data on costs in a uniform and consistent manner that would be appropriate for economic evaluations and to inform policy. Second, the survey was constructed such that program administrators potentially could use it as a tool for internal purposes related to operations and planning. We begin by describing the economic conceptual framework on which the survey is based and the need for a cost data collection instrument that can be used both within and outside of a traditional research setting. We then outline the survey components and how they were developed, pilot-tested, and refined. We conclude with a discussion of how this survey is currently being used and how a survey of this type can be applied in other settings to collect program cost data for economic evaluations.

This article describes the development of a QOL conceptual and measurement framework, and summarizes how this framework is currently being used both nationally and internationally to assess and report personal QOL-related outcomes, to guide quality improvement strategies, and to evaluate the effectiveness of those strategies. Implications of such use are discussed, including those related to understanding mental models, developing internal data systems, supporting organization change, and building on current public policies. The article concludes with reference to the evolving nature of the QOL concept and the impact of this on model development and transdisciplinary research. 2 2008 31 5 181 190 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149-7189(08)00010-4 Schalock, Robert L.

In this paper the research assessment tool \"face validity\" is discussed as one way to help planners decipher when the community is sharing empirically grounded observations that can advance the applicability of the plan making process. Face validity provides a common sense assessment of research conclusions. It allows the assessor to look at an entire research project and ask: \"on the face of things, does this research make sense?\" With planners listening to citizen comments with an ear for face validity observations, holds open the opportunity for government to empirically learn from the community to see if they \"got it right.\" And if not, to chart out a course on how they can get it right.

Teachers' lack of understanding of new, competence-based assessments as well as the lack of key stakeholders' involvement, hamper effective and efficient self-evaluations by teachers of innovative, competence-based assessments (CBAs). While evaluating two CBAs in Agricultural Vocational Education and Training institutions, two interventions in the evaluation process aimed to tackle these problems were examined: (1) starting with explicating the CBA in the teacher team using a concrete explication format and (2) qualitatively involving key stakeholders (i.e., teachers, students and employers) in the evaluation of the CBA through mixed-group interviews. Quantitative and qualitative analysis, as well as stakeholders' perceptions are used to find indications for the added value of these interventions for evaluation and further improvement of the CBAs. Results show that external facilitation is needed to make both interventions work. However, under this condition, explicating the CBA led to more complete, concrete and shared understandings of the actual CBA among teachers and mixed-groups interviews resulted in more concrete and elaborate evaluations of the CBAs' quality and more ideas for improvement. Both interventions can facilitate building up elaborate, more valid and concrete arguments for CBA quality in self-evaluations, certainly in the case of evaluating innovative assessments. Lessons learned will provide guidelines for incorporating the interventions into other evaluations of innovative programs.

A large number of these families come from African and Middle Eastern countries and have common experiences of trauma, dislocation, loss and many are victims of genocide, war, and torture. Pre-migration experiences together with the considerable challenges of settling into a new country can significantly affect family well-being and parenting practices. It is therefore important that child and family welfare service planners are well informed about how best to support refugee families using culturally competent family intervention and community development practices. This paper draws on the findings of a research project designed to examine why recently arrived families from refugee backgrounds are presenting in the South Australian child protection system and to identify culturally appropriate strategies for intervention. The paper presents findings from the project that relate to (1) refugee parents', community members' and child protection practitioners' perspectives on the challenges to being a refugee parent in Australia and (2) strategies and resources relevant to prevention and early intervention in refugee families before statutory child protection intervention becomes necessary.

In setting the context for future chapters appearing in this special issue of the Journal of Evaluation and Program Planning, attention is devoted to the political circumstances associated with retrenchment in the public sector and increased involvement of citizens in environmental issues in their regions. It further is nested in the context of potential political reforms in a stable market democracy where education is but one strategy that can be bundled with regulations and taxes/subsidies. Additional attention is directed to explaining many of the key evaluation theories - utilization-focused evaluation, evaluative capacity building, and program-theory driven evaluation. The final section of this chapter situates the subsequent chapters of this volume based on the demographic target (youth or adult) as well as connection to a particular evaluation theory.

Educational institutions have to adopt new strategies to make best use of the opportunities and counter the challenges. One of these challenges is how to assess the performance of academic programs based on multiple criteria. Keeping this in view, this paper attempts to evaluate the performance efficiencies of 19 academic departments of IIT Roorkee (India) through data envelopment analysis (DEA) technique. The technique has been used to assess the performance of academic institutions in a number of countries like USA, UK, Australia, etc. But we are using it first time in Indian context to the best of our knowledge. Applying DEA models, we calculate technical, pure technical and scale efficiencies and identify the reference sets for inefficient departments. Input and output projections are also suggested for inefficient departments to reach the frontier. Overall performance, research performance and teaching performance are assessed separately using sensitivity analysis.

These attitudes and opinions are directly related to an employee's engagement within the company. In many instances, employees wait in vain for the survey response and the subsequent employer actions, but the truth is sometimes management does not know what to do with the results. For this reason, we theorize that this type of survey, typically utilizing the Likert-scale, is not adequately assisting management in addressing employee engagement and retention issues. For instance, in many occasions, once the survey results are tabulated, companies are doing little or nothing to address the issues. In fact, far too many companies make the mistake of conducting employee engagement surveys, and then ignore the answers. Thus, we propose that a company should take advantage of the survey results, and utilize them to provide data to bridge employees' needs and goals with stakeholders' responsibilities and goals by refining and incorporating them into a hierarchical decision model (HDM). Thus, this would essentially be utilizing the quantitative data to determine what to measure qualitatively. We use a case from the high tech industry, specifically focusing on the engineering environment. Engineering environments are known to be more creative and such approaches would be more beneficial.

These theories will serve as the basis for evaluating the intended consequences of this evaluation system, while not losing sight of emerging unintended consequences. We first analyzed legal and policy documents and then interviewed fourteen representatives of the four stakeholder groups involved in the program's design and implementation, in order to gain insight into their respective conceptions of the program's functioning and intended effects. The results show that, as to be expected and despite the long and difficult negotiation process that preceded implementation of this program, multiple political stakeholders still view the program's intended effects differently. However, there was substantial overlap regarding a number of intended effects, such as building the capacity of, and triggering change in, teachers with shortcomings, and informing the selection of new teachers and facilitating the exit of unsatisfactory teachers from the system. It was difficult to get interviewees to talk about how exactly these intended effects are supposed to be achieved. The paper draws conclusions regarding theory elaboration process involving multiple stakeholders in a highly political context.

Due to lack of rail capacity, mainly trucks will haul this volume of freight, challenging an already much constrained highway network. What are the total costs associated with this additional traffic, in particular, congestion, safety and emission? Since a major source of this expected flow is the Port of New York-New Jersey, this paper focuses on the estimation of the full marginal costs of truck traffic resulting from the further expansion of the port's activities.

Findings, issues, and lessons learned about program evaluation are examined from a national qualitative study of 15 faith-based human service programs targeting those in need in urban areas. Using a grounded theory design, five properties emerge as part of the evaluation network: (1) philosophy of accountability, (2) legitimacy, (3) evaluation design, (4) feedback loop, and (5) barriers to evaluation. While funders expect measurable outcomes to evaluate service effectiveness, respondents acknowledge other competing expectations of multiple constituents in religious and secular communities. What emerges is an excellent example of managing multiple program evaluation demands in programs that are particularly facile at process evaluation in the interest of quality service and relationship building. The article concludes with important lessons learned about the process of program evaluation.

This article focuses on an online course, Applied Environmental Education Program Evaluation (AEEPE), which provides nonformal educators with an understanding of how evaluation can be used to improve their EE programs. The authors provide descriptions of key aspects and strategies for addressing challenges they face in teaching AEEPE, such as: reducing attrition, developing and maintaining a social learning environment online, and improving students' understanding of attribution and logic models. While the course equips environmental educators with the skills necessary to design and implement basic evaluations, there is less certainty that the course contributes to generating demand for evaluation within organizations and the profession. Therefore the authors call on national organizations and associations for help with increasing the demand for ECB in the EE community.

Over time, in response to national funders' pursuing system of care for different populations and their own experience, states, tribes and localities have applied system of care principles, values and operational characteristics to other populations (children and adults). The definition offered by Hodges et al., has an unintended effect of constraining the properties (and potential) of system of care in its limitation to a single population. This paper argues that the adaptations made to the original Stroul and Friedman definition in the training curriculum Building Systems of Care: A Primer adequately encompass properties that reflect state, tribal and local implementation experience and are specific to planning, implementing and evaluating a system of care, without limiting system of care to any one population.

This paper critically reviews and synthesizes the results and lessons learned from 24 evaluated peer-led programs with an HIV/AIDS risk reduction component that target youth in the communities where they live and are delivered in low- and middle-income countries. Interventions were identified through a comprehensive search of the peer reviewed AIDS-related literature as well as publication lists of major organizations in the UN family that address HIV and AIDS. Our synthesis of study results finds that these programs have demonstrated success in effecting positive change in knowledge and condom use and have demonstrated some success in changing community attitudes and norms. Effects on other sexual behaviors and STI rates were equivocal. We include an overview of characteristics of successful programs, a review of program limitations, and recommendations for the development and implementation of successful community-based peer-led programs in low-income countries.

Programs, systems and a cumulative science of children's mental health services The system of care approach as a strategy for serving children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbance (SED) is by any measure a success with one exception: there is controversy regarding the scientific evidence documenting that the services provided through systems of care improve the symptomatic and functional outcomes of the youth and their families served when compared to the services provided through more traditional service systems. This paper traces this essential problem to challenges in the definitions of systems of care, particularly the level at which systems of care are conceived to exist and the impact of these challenges on the collection of relevant and meaningful data that could otherwise create a cumulative science regarding systemic interventions for youth with SED. In many regards, systems of care are often viewed in the context of programs of care that are predominantly evaluated within program evaluation rather than system evaluation perspectives. This article elucidates the problems created by the varying definitions of systems of care for the development of a cumulative practice and policy relevant research base pertaining to children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbance. Alternative strategies for future research are discussed in the context of alternative definitions of the system of care concept.

This article describes the development of a 33-item, survey questionnaire measuring community members' perceptions of the impact of research partnerships addressing health or social issues. The Community Impacts of Research Oriented Partnerships (CIROP) was developed using information from the literatures on health promotion, community development, research utilization, and community-based participatory research, and from focus groups involving 29 key informants. Data from 174 community members were used to determine the factor structure, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability of the four CIROP scales, and to provide evidence of construct validity. The CIROP informs research partnerships about the extent of their impact in the areas of Personal Knowledge Development, Personal Research Skill Development, Organizational/Group Access To and Use of Information, and Community and Organizational Development, allowing them to demonstrate accountability to funding bodies. As well, the CIROP can be used as a research tool to assess the effectiveness of knowledge sharing approaches, determine the most influential activities of research partnerships, and determine structural characteristics of partnerships associated with various types of impact. The CIROP provides a better understanding of community members' perspectives and expectations of research partnerships, with important implications for knowledge transfer and uptake.

By doing so, we begin to identify the necessary and sufficient components that, at minimum, move us from usual care within a naturally occurring system to a true system of care. Further, by documenting and measuring the degree to which key components are operating, we may be able to identify the most successful strategies in creating system reform. The theory of change and logic model offer a useful framework for communities to begin the adaptive work necessary to effect true transformation. Using the experience of two system of care communities, this new definition and the utility of a theory of change and logic model framework for defining local system transformation efforts will be discussed. Implications for the field, including the need to further examine the natural progression of systems change and to create quantifiable measures of transformation, will be raised as new challenges for the evolving system of care movement.

In 1998, the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine began drawing attention to the discrepancy between research findings and practice patterns in the treatment of substance abuse. The community coalition described in this study was developed to create a partnership between substance abuse treatment providers, policy makers, university-based researchers, and consumers to examine treatment advances and evaluate their possible application in local community settings. In the first year the community coalition conducted a needs assessment, with the goal of prioritizing areas for practice change. The needs assessment process included focus groups, key informant interviews, and a survey of substance abuse treatment providers. The questions addressed at each stage of the assessment varied, but collectively all methods formed the basis for consensus-building for a change in practice in substance abuse treatment. The results of the needs assessment were further refined and influenced the development and implementation of two evidence-based practices (EBPs) within multiple agencies. Implications for using a community needs assessment to highlight coalition building and identify and adopting EBPs are discussed.

Information was obtained on a sample of 164 caregivers' use of eleven different types of support service. Descriptive and comparative analyses were used to detect the differences between users and nonusers of caregiver support services. Six measures included were caregiving appraisal scale, caregiving burden, caregiving mastery, caregiving satisfaction, hour of care, and service satisfaction. Using consulting and education services is associated with lessening of subjective burden; using financial support services is associated with more beneficial caregiver appraisal, such as better caregiver mastery. The findings are practical and helpful for future caregiver service and program development and evaluation and policy making for supporting caregivers. In addition, the evaluation method demonstrated in the study provided a simple and moderately effective method for service agencies which would like to evaluate their family caregiver support services.

International Journal of Public Sector Management 18(2), 151-163.]. The purpose of this paper is to empirically compare the effectiveness criteria used by a nonprofit Canadian sport organization and its partners embedded in multiple cross-sectoral relationships. To that end, three levels of effectiveness criteria were investigated: the community, network, and organization levels. A qualitative case study was conducted on the nonprofit sport organization and its multiple cross-sectoral partners. The results suggest that some criteria for measuring IOR effectiveness among partners were highly interrelated, some reflected competing values, some were shared across all partners, and some were ambiguous in the measures of effectiveness of IOR outcomes. Implications for future research and for practice are discussed.

This paper presents the first that we know of a qualitative study that explores staff and resident experience of the change process of a therapeutic community to an evidence-based modified therapeutic community for homeless individuals with co-occurring substance abuse and mental illness disorders. The sample consists of 20 participants; 10 staff and 10 residents. Interviews were conducted at the agency, recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were organized and coded from a grounded theory perspective. Themes and patterns of staff and resident experience were identified. The change in program structure from TC to MTC were perceived by staff as efforts to accommodate the particular needs of the homeless individuals with mental and substance abuse disorders and feeling they were inadequately prepared with inadequate resources to facilitate a successful transition. Participant descriptions were described in terms of loss of structure, loss of peers and being helped. Findings have potential to shape implementation of evidence-based practices in community substance abuse treatment.

Three alternative data collection methods for estimating service-level costs in methadone treatment programs were evaluated: key informants, staff surveys, and staff diaries. We analyzed data from 25 methadone clinics across the United States. Results indicate that for the three primary services offered at methadone clinics--individual counseling, group counseling, and methadone dosing--no statistically significant differences exist in the mean estimates of costs per session across programs. Of the other five services analyzed, we found no statistically significant differences in two of the mean costs per session and a small but statistically significant difference in another service. We found large and statistically significant differences in mean costs for two services, initial patient assessment and initial medical services. Although there is no gold standard available to judge which method is the best to use, we concluded that the key informant method yields more reliable cost estimates compared with the staff methods and is less burdensome to both the treatment programs and to researchers. Our findings suggest that the key informant method is the preferred method for costing substance abuse treatment services.

Far less frequent is careful attention to analysis of stakeholders' interests, needs, concerns, power, priorities, and perspectives and subsequent application of that knowledge to the design of evaluations. This article is meant to help readers understand and apply stakeholder identification and analysis techniques in the design of credible evaluations that enhance primary intended use by primary intended users. While presented using a utilization-focused-evaluation (UFE) lens, the techniques are not UFE-dependent. The article presents a range of the most relevant techniques to identify and analyze evaluation stakeholders. The techniques are arranged according to their ability to inform the process of developing and implementing an evaluation design and of making use of the evaluation's findings.

Action research is distinctive in the sense that the researcher has a dual role as both researcher and implementer of the program studied. The article is based on two Norwegian action-oriented studies that aimed to explore the potential role of online self-help groups for breast cancer patients and adolescents with mentally ill parents respectively. We argue that action research can contribute both to the generation of knowledge, as well as a greater sense of ownership to the program among those who are intended to use it. Nonetheless, a potential conflict between the researcher's pursuit of data, and ethical considerations became apparent in the contexts studied here. Bearing these challenges in mind, we still conclude that action research offers an important contribution for the further development of health care services.

Applying a deterministic data matching methodology, we linked 6545 Californians admitted to 43 substance abuse treatment programs between 2000 and 2001 to administrative data acquired from three state agency databases. We compared self-reported treatment outcome measures to equivalent measures derived from official records on motor vehicle driving incidents, criminal history, and mental health services utilization. Administrative data provided analogous results in some measures (e.g., percent of people using mental health services, percent ever arrested) and more accurate results in others (e.g., frequency of service utilization, and frequency of arrests). Similar to findings based on the interview data, the administrative data also revealed improvements in several domains 1-year post-treatment compared to 1-year pre-treatment. Experiences with data linkage procedures and strategies for enhancing record linkage accuracy are discussed. Findings illustrate the value of using administrative records for substance abuse treatment outcome evaluation, while highlighting areas for improvement for future cross-system data linkage efforts. 2 2008 31 5 125 135 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149-7189(08)00011-6 Hser, Yih-Ing Evans, Elizabeth oai:RePEc:eee:epplan:v:2:y:1979:i:3:p:197-2072019-08-10RePEc:eee:epplan article Assessment of client/patient satisfaction: Development of a general scale 3 1979 2 1 197 207 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0149-7189(79)90094-6 Larsen, Daniel L.

However, many CBOs, particularly, small- to medium-size organizations, lack the capacity to plan, implement, and evaluate their successes. Moreover, little assistance has been provided to enhance their capacity and the effectiveness of technical assistance to enhance capacity is likewise limited. A unique private-academic partnership is described that simultaneously conducted program evaluation and addressed the capacity needs of 24 CBOs funded by the Pfizer Foundation Southern HIV/AIDS Prevention Initiative. Assessments of key program staff members at 12 and 18 months after the initial cross-site program assessment survey indicated a significant improvement in the CBOs' knowledge, skills, and abilities and a substantial reduction in their technical assistance needs for HIV/AIDS prevention. Full participation of CBOs in technical assistance and a concurrent empowerment evaluation framework were necessary to enhance prevention capacity.

The present study exposes underlying social cognitive factors for donation to relief campaigns.

The aim was to expand and improve an already existing model by Cheung and Chan [Cheung, C. K., & Chan, C. M. (2000). Social-cognitive factors of donating money to charity, with special attention to an international relief organisation. Evaluation and Program Planning, 23, 241-253]. The expanded model showed a better fit. Furthermore, the expanded model explained two-thirds of the variance of the intention to donate to a disaster relief campaign. The greatest predictor of the intention to donate proved to be \"Past donation to disaster relief campaigns.\" The factor \"News exposure\" was indicated to be a valuable additional factor, as it had a significant direct effect on \"Awareness of a disaster relief campaign\" and was the only factor that had a total effect on all other factors, including \"Intention to donate to a disaster relief campaign.\" Donation Social cognitive theory Disaster relief campaigns 2 2009 32 5 148 157 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149-7189(08)00107-9 Oosterhof, Liesbeth Heuvelman, Ard Peters, Oscar oai:RePEc:eee:epplan:v:21:y:1998:i:4:p:437-4482019-08-10RePEc:eee:epplan article Evaluation of the orphans reunification project in Eritrea 4 1998 21 11 437 448 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149-7189(98)00033-0 Morah, E.

This study finds that firm size, industry, and ratio of public subsidy on research and development (R&D) budget of recipient firm significantly influences the technical efficiency of GSP in Taiwan. After controlling these external variables, the mean value of technical efficiency in the third stage increases and becomes significantly different to that in the first stage. Most GSPs increase their returns when their projects are scaled up. Furthermore, government policy makers must establish the upper-limit ratio of subsidies on R&D budgets of recipient firms to avoid inefficient use of public funds.

We provide a detailed overview of the evaluation and an assessment of the costs incurred during the service delivery (screening) phase of the program.Methods Tailored cost questionnaires were completed by staff at the five CRCSDP sites for the first 2 years of the program. We collected cost data for clinical and programmatic activities (program management, data collection and tracking, etc.). We also measured in-kind contributions and assigned values to them.Results During the first 2 years of the demonstration excluding the start-up cost, the average cost per person was $2569. Per person cost of clinical services alone ranged from $264 to $1385, while per person programmatic costs ranged from $545 to $3017.Conclusion Colorectal cancer screening programs can incur substantial costs for some non-clinical activities, such as data collection/tracking, and these support activities should be managed carefully to control costs and ensure successful program implementation. Our findings highlight the importance of performing economic evaluation to guide the design of future colorectal cancer screening programs.

This article describes the use of an integer programming tool, Multiple Choice Knapsack Problem (MCKP), to provide optimal solutions to transportation programming problems in cases where alternative versions of projects are under consideration. In this paper, optimization methods for use in the transportation programming process are compared and then the process of building and solving the optimization problems is discussed. The concepts about the use of MCKP are presented and a real-world transportation programming example at various budget levels is provided. This article illustrates how the use of MCKP addresses the modern complexities and provides timely solutions in transportation programming practice. While the article uses transportation programming as a case study, MCKP can be useful in other fields where a similar decision among a subset of the alternatives is required.

The research addressed gaps in knowledge about the specific needs of these organizations for improved effectiveness and long-term sustainability. A telephone survey of 659 organizations, supplemented by focus groups with 37 participants in the state's largest cities, indicated substantial need and interest in capacity-building technical assistance in areas such as revenue-generating activities, marketing and public relations, information technology training, program evaluation, and board leadership development. The limited ability of these organizations to pay for the needed assistance creates challenges for planning approaches to meet these vital needs.

After an introductory exposition, in the first part of the paper, a broad overview of international experiences regarding information systems on transportation is given, focusing in particular on the relationship between transportation system's performance monitoring and the decision-making process, and on the importance of this connection in the evaluation and planning process, in Italian and European cases. Next, the methodological design of an information system to support efficient and sustainable transportation planning and management aiming to integrate inputs from several different data sources is presented. The resulting framework deploys modular and integrated databases which include data stemming from different national or regional data banks and which integrate information belonging to different transportation fields. For this reason, it allows public administrations to account for many strategic elements that influence their decisions regarding transportation, both from a systemic and infrastructural point of view.

The New Mexico study on office-based prescribing and community pharmacy dispensing of methadone is a research demonstration project that phases a small group of female methadone maintenance patients out of methadone clinics and into a program where they will obtain their scheduled doses of methadone at pharmacies that work in collaboration with physicians and a social worker.The patient's methadone treatment will in this way become part of their overall health care. Early detection of problems of implementation (e.g., the omission of program content or the delivery of inaccurate information) enables the researcher to make adjustments before the problems become unmanageable and the integrity of the original research design is compromised. A model-guided process evaluation can critically inform health services research demonstrations designed for enabling continuous, ongoing feedback and improvement of client-related services.

Participants from the first two groups generated 90 unique food items in response to the question \"What are the foods you associate with being African American?\" Participants individually ranked their top three most unhealthy foods. The next two groups generated 116 unique food items in response to the question \"What foods do you consider to be healthy?\" Participants individually ranked their top three foods that were considered most associated with AA.Results The top five foods associated with AA were chitterlings, fried chicken, pig parts, greens prepared with ham hock, and pork ribs. Of the foods associated with AA, chitterlings, pig parts, fatback, fried chicken, and greens prepared with ham hocks were ranked as the unhealthiest. The top five healthy foods were broccoli, boiled greens, baked fish, grapefruit, and broiled fish. From these top five healthy foods, only boiled greens were considered to be associated with AA.Conclusions Many of the foods AA consider as traditional foods are also perceived as unhealthy. On the contrary, foods perceived to have the most health value may not be a routine part of AA food patterns. Understanding AA perceptions of the healthfulness of foods can be informative for culturally appropriate nutrition intervention development.

This report presents the development and conduct of this evaluation study; how funding was obtained; and how foster youth were hired, trained, and employed to produce a timely and informative evaluation of the performance of 32 group homes where some of the foster youth formerly resided. The results of the study are described in another paper. This report contributes to evaluation practice in the newly emerging field of youth-led evaluations. The achievements of this project in utilizing group home clients to evaluate services with which they were familiar may stimulate other evaluators to develop similar projects, thereby enriching the development of our youth and promoting more informative evaluation findings. 2 2008 31 5 174 180 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149-7189(08)00012-8 Green, Rex S.

The aim of CTPP was to improve HIV knowledge and to contribute to positive behavior changes in the targeted populations. This paper describes the evaluation of the CTPP, one year after implementation. The evaluation combined qualitative interviews with key informants and trainers and a post-intervention survey of 142 community members. The successes of the CTPP included capacity building of trainers through an innovative training approach and HIV and AIDS knowledge transfer to community trainers and targeted communities in remote mining towns. The Soul City edutainment brand is popular and emerged as a major reason for success. Challenges included insufficient attention paid to contextual factors, resource constraints and the lack of a monitoring and evaluation framework. Independent evaluations are useful to strengthen program implementation. In remote areas and resource constraint settings, partnerships between non-governmental organisations and corporations may be required for successful community HIV and AIDS initiatives.

There has been considerable debate as to whether different research methods (e.g. stated versus revealed preference) will lead to different values of travel time savings, and which segmentations (e.g. by income or mode) are most important to capture the heterogeneity in these values. In addition there are many countries where no specific valuation studies have been done. In this paper new equations are estimated on the outcomes of value of travel time savings studies from various countries. In the data set, several countries appear more than once, which is taken into account by estimating random effects panel models. The meta-analysis sheds some new light on the variation of the value of travel time savings by income, country, travel purpose, mode, distance and by survey method. Furthermore, the resulting meta-models are applied to produce new values of travel time savings for business travel, commuting and for other purposes in passenger transport, for 25 European Union Member states. Similar methods could be used to statistically analyse studies carried out on other non-monetary effects, both for transport and non-transport projects, and for inclusion in cost-benefit analysis.

At intake, dropouts had lengthier criminal histories, lower treatment motivation, more severe employment and psychiatric problems, and more were using drugs, especially heroin. Relatively fewer dropouts received residential treatment and their retention was much shorter. A similar proportion of dropouts received services as completers and the mean number of services received per day by dropouts was generally more, especially to address psychiatric problems, during the first three months of treatment. The most commonly offender-reported reasons for dropout included low treatment motivation (46.2%) and the difficulty of the Proposition 36 program (20.0%). Consequences for dropout included incarceration (25.3%) and permission to try treatment again (24.0%). Several factors predicting drug treatment dropout were identified. Both groups demonstrated improved functioning at one-year follow-up, but fewer dropouts had a successful outcome (34.5% vs. 59.1%) and their recidivism rate was significantly higher (62.9% vs. 28.9%) even after controlling for baseline differences. Understanding factors associated with drug treatment dropout can aid efforts to improve completion rates, outcomes, and overall effectiveness of California's Proposition 36 program. Findings may also aid a broader audience of researchers and policy analysts who are charged with designing and evaluating criminal-justice diversion programs for treating drug-addicted offenders.

Complex, emergent programs, where implementation varies considerably over time and across sites to respond to local needs and opportunities, present challenges to conventional methods for cost-benefit evaluation. Such programs are characterized by: ill-defined boundaries of what constitutes the intervention, and hence the resources used; non-standardized procedures; differing short-term outcomes across projects, even within the same long-term goals; and outcomes that are the result of multiple factors and co-production, making counter-factual approaches to attribution inadequate and the use of standardized outcome measures problematic. The paper discusses the advantages and limitations of this method and its implications for cost-benefit evaluation of complex programs.

The programme, implemented in two low-income communities, focused on the reduction of risks to unintentional childhood injuries. The evaluation comprised a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, including observations in conjunction with an evaluator's journal, diaries kept by the home visitors, interviews and focus group discussions. Short questionnaires were administered to programme staff and home visitors. Caregivers were visited to attain their assessment of visitors and the programme. These methods resulted in a detailed description of implementation processes, but more importantly gave insight into the experiences and perceptions of the social actors, i.e. programme staff, visitors and caregivers. It also offered possible explanations for the difference in the intervention effect between the two sites. Two major challenges to the evaluation were: (i) the power-imbalance between the evaluator and community participants (visitors and caregivers) and (ii) the language- and cultural barriers between evaluator and community participants. The evaluation demonstrated that process information can contribute towards explaining outcome results, but also that active participation from all social actors is a necessary condition if process evaluations are to result in programme improvement. 2 2008 31 5 209 216 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149-7189(08)00014-1 Odendaal, Willem A.

Recently, two theoretical frameworks have been offered - Daigneault and Jacob's participatory evaluation measurement index and Champagne and Smits' model of practical participatory evaluation. In this case report, we apply these frameworks to test alignment with practitioner experience and to examine the degree to which they contribute to the understanding of the case. The context of the case report is an on-going program evaluation at a college of nursing believed to be an example of a successful participatory evaluation. Application of the participatory evaluation measurement index indicated the evaluation qualified as participatory at a minimal level historically and increased to a moderate level of participation after a re-design to involve an external evaluator. Ratings aligned with the intentional goals of evaluators. The model of practical participatory evaluation was found to be a good fit and descriptive of the case, although the planning and design processes may need to be added to the model. The exercise of applying the index and the P-PE model enlightened both evaluators and stakeholders concerning factors that contributed to the successful partnership and outcomes of the evaluation.

The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility and utility of linking program performance scores and expenditures into a Report of Performance Measures (RPM). We analyzed secondary data on performance indicators, selected by HD staff, and expenditures, related to six surveillance activities, from two, similar, high-incidence, tuberculosis (TB) programs in Florida from 2002 to 2003. We compared the findings between the county HDs as an illustration of basic cost-effectiveness benchmarking, based on the cost-effectiveness grid. Data included here provide examples of: (1) two instances in which one county was operating relatively inefficiently compared to the other; (2) two instances in which performance and expenditures were similar for the counties; and (3) two instances in which one county spent more for higher performance scores than the other. These data illustrate how the RPM can be used to facilitate benchmarking, a basic evaluation tool. They also demonstrate ways to identify potential operational inefficiencies in a single time period and ultimately over time. It is thus likely to be a feasible and useful management tool.

The Delphi method, a consensus-building tool, is a promising process to promote and encourage involvement from all stakeholders during the evaluation framing process. The Delphi method removes geographic challenges and time boundaries allowing all stakeholders to participate. The Delphi method uses a series of surveys interspersed with controlled feedback designed to gather information and build consensus without requiring face-to-face meetings. Two different formats of the Delphi method, a paper-and-pencil, postal-mail version and a web-based, real-time computer version are compared in this study. Both versions of the Delphi were administered to a non-profit community based organization as part of framing an evaluation. Participation rates were better with the paper-pencil version. The quantity and quality of data collected were comparable in both versions.

However, there is disagreement about what constitutes systems thinking. Its meaning is ambiguous, and systems scholars have made diverse and divergent attempts to describe it. Alternative origins include: von Bertalanffy, Aristotle, Lao Tsu or multiple aperiodic \"waves.\" Some scholars describe it as synonymous with systems sciences (i.e., nonlinear dynamics, complexity, chaos). Others view it as taxonomy--a laundry list of systems approaches. Within so much noise, it is often difficult for evaluators to find the systems thinking signal. Recent work in systems thinking describes it as an emergent property of four simple conceptual patterns (rules). For an evaluator to become a \"systems thinker\", he or she need not spend years learning many methods or nonlinear sciences. Instead, with some practice, one can learn to apply these four simple rules to existing evaluation knowledge with transformative results. 3 2008 31 8 299 310 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149-7189(08)00002-5 Cabrera, Derek Colosi, Laura Lobdell, Claire oai:RePEc:eee:epplan:v:28:y:2005:i:1:p:15-212019-08-10RePEc:eee:epplan article Contacting participants for follow-up: how much effort is required to retain participants in longitudinal studies? 1 2005 28 15 21 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149-7189(04)00075-8 Cotter, Robert B.

In this study, we examined whether team member and leader personality dimensions assessed at the time of team formation predicted local prevention team functioning 2.5-3.5 years later. Participants were 159 prevention team members in 14 communities participating in the PROSPER study of prevention program dissemination. Three aspects of personality, aggregated at the team level, were examined as predictors: Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, and Agreeableness. A series of multivariate regression analyses were performed that accounted for the interdependency of five categories of team functioning. Results showed that average team member Openness was negatively, and Conscientiousness was positively linked to team functioning. The findings have implications for decisions about the level and nature of technical assistance support provided to community prevention teams.

This paper presents a case study of capacity assessment at the local level. Capacity evaluation methods are presented, with emphasis on the theoretical framework used to guide the evaluation. The capacity evaluation framework presented herein was theoretically based and designed to generate practical information to facilitate the adoption of a locally tailored youth obesity prevention program, VERB(TM) Summer Scorecard (VSS). Using multiple methods, four aspects of community capacity were assessed, including community, knowledge and skills, resources, and power. Within each category, factors that facilitated or impeded program implementation were distinguished. The evaluation protocol was designed to generate information increasing community capacity to sustain a community-based obesity prevention program. Capacity tables were used as a program-planning tool and as a system for sharing implementation and sustainability requirements with potential adopters. This case study also explores how to use capacity assessment results to empower coalitions to serve as catalysts for development of local programs in other communities. 2 2008 31 5 145 159 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149-7189(08)00004-9 Alfonso, Moya L.

In response, the National Science Foundation formed statewide partnerships of universities to develop programs to address this disparity. The deliberations and experiences in evaluating one such partnership are retrospectively reviewed. Problems and issues encountered during conceptualization and implementation are presented. Lessons learned from this endeavor should generalize to similar situations and provide guidance for others new to or interested in evaluating STEM retention programs as well as those evaluating collaborative endeavors. 3 2008 31 8 277 283 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149-7189(08)00032-3 White, Jeffry L.

The fundamental methods of the focus group technique have been well discussed, as have their potential advantages. Less guidance tends to be provided regarding the analysis of data resulting from focus groups or how to organize and defend conclusions drawn from the analysis. This article reviews the methodology of the focus group with an emphasis on thematic analysis of latent data at three levels, articulated, attributional, and emergent. The three levels are described and illustrated with respect to their value and contribution to evaluation within the framework of the group method and qualitative standards of thematic analysis.

The performance benchmarks resulting from this strategy have become the basis for allocation of government funding and other scarce resources. In this work, data envelopment analysis (DEA) was used to construct a scalar measure of efficiency for all police precincts. Further analyses on the effect of degree of urbanization and possible weight restrictions on the outputs upon the efficiency scores of each decision making unit (DMU) were conducted. In addition, a three-stage DEA model was applied to explicitly incorporate environmental factors into the DEA model. The results show that the external environmental factors specified in this study may have some effects on the efficiency scores of each district, albeit not statistically significant. Most decision making units are technically efficient; the average technical efficiency of all DMUs was as high as 98.46% when external environmental factors were accounted for.

While useful in describing some programs, the linear nature of the logic model makes it difficult to capture the complex relationships within larger, multifaceted programs. Causal loop diagrams based on a systems thinking approach can better capture a multidimensional, layered program model while providing a more complete understanding of the relationship between program elements, which enables evaluators to examine influences and dependencies between and within program components. Few studies describe how to conceptualize and apply systems models for educational program evaluation. The goal of this paper is to use our NSF-funded, Interdisciplinary GK-12 project: Bringing Authentic Problem Solving in STEM to Rural Middle Schools to illustrate a systems thinking approach to model a complex educational program to aid in evaluation. GK-12 pairs eight teachers with eight STEM doctoral fellows per program year to implement curricula in middle schools. We demonstrate how systems thinking provides added value by modeling the participant groups, instruments, outcomes, and other factors in ways that enhance the interpretation of quantitative and qualitative data. Limitations of the model include added complexity. Implications include better understanding of interactions and outcomes and analyses reflecting interacting or conflicting variables.

Together, these models comprise a tailored, collaborative approach to enhancing research-informed practice in community-based clinical service organizations. The models place different degrees of emphasis on the development of research-related skills in practitioners, the generation of knowledge tailored to clinical practice, and knowledge sharing. The nature, philosophical basis, roles of research staff members, outputs and impacts, and strengths and limitations of each model are described, in the context of a long-standing, interdisciplinary research program in a children's rehabilitation service organization. The use of the model framework as a tool for the design of interdisciplinary, community-based research programs is discussed. 2 2008 31 5 160 173 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149-7189(08)00006-2 King, Gillian Currie, Melissa Smith, Linda Servais, Michelle McDougall, Janette oai:RePEc:eee:epplan:v:15:y:1992:i:1:p:33-432019-08-10RePEc:eee:epplan article Priority setting in government : Beyond the magic bullet 1 1992 15 1 33 43 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0149-7189(92)90058-3 Bosin, Morris Robert oai:RePEc:eee:epplan:v:30:y:2007:i:4:p:404-4092019-08-10RePEc:eee:epplan article Trustworthiness in evaluation practice: An emphasis on the relational 4 2007 30 11 404 409 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149-7189(07)00065-1 Rallis, Sharon F.

All were involved in one or more of three types of research activity: discovery, development, and delivery, consistent with the 3D continuum developed by the National Cancer Institute. Data were collected in 2007 using surveys of key informants in each organization. Using network analysis methods, we examined the structure of each type of network as well as the relationship between network position and the importance of cancer research to each organization's mission. Findings indicated that while both the discovery and delivery networks were comparably densely connected, their centrality structures were quite different. In contrast, the structures of both these networks were similar to the development network. Centrality in the discovery and development networks was positively related to the importance of cancer research to the organization, but not in the delivery network. Implications of the findings for future research, policy, and planning are discussed.

This evaluation plan utilized a survey of sixth grade students, administered before and after exposure to a year-long abstinence education program. Components of the logic model were linked to specific survey questions. Exploratory factor analysis was then used to assess whether and how the questions in the survey fit with the constructs of the model; confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the hypothesis that the factors identified in the exploratory analysis were consistently represented in the survey.Major conclusions A logic model is a tool that engages stakeholders to link evaluation instruments more closely to specific program objectives. Thus, stakeholders can more closely assess the extent to which project outcomes have been achieved. In addition, use of factor analysis in the evaluation process can help the stakeholders better understand whether evaluation instruments such as a survey adequately assess program effectiveness. Lastly, a logic model process can help to achieve consensus among diverse stakeholders, by allowing them to focus on objectives that are concrete, measurable, and mutually acceptable.

Methods: A total of 488 HIV-infected patients, aged 18 years and older, receiving HCT service at clinics in Mpumalanga, received an \"Options for Health\" intervention delivered by clinic lay counsellors. Intervention lay counsellors implemented a brief risk reduction intervention at on average 2.3 sessions to help patients reduce their unprotected sexual behaviour. Questionnaires were administered at baseline and 4 months following the intervention to assess HIV risk behaviour in previous 3 months. Results: A significant increase in AIDS knowledge, behavioural intentions and risk reduction efficacy among participants at follow-up was found. Participants at 4-month follow-up reported a significant reduction of multiple partners, unprotected sex, alcohol or drug use in a sexual context, and transactional sex. In addition, sexual abstinence increased and alcohol use decreased, in the past 3 months. Conclusions: A lay counsellor-delivered HIV prevention intervention targeting HIV-infected patients seems to be feasible to implement with fidelity in the South African HCT setting and promising at reducing risk behaviour.

That model includes the concepts of internal and external validity and within that model, the preeminence of internal validity as demonstrated in the top-down approach. Evaluators and researchers have, however, increasingly recognized that in an evaluation, the over-emphasis on internal validity reduces that evaluation's usefulness and contributes to the gulf between academic and practical communities regarding interventions. This article examines the limitations of the Campbellian validity model and the top-down approach and provides a comprehensive, alternative model, known as the integrative validity model for program evaluation. The integrative validity model includes the concept of viable validity, which is predicated on a bottom-up approach to validity. This approach better reflects stakeholders' evaluation views and concerns, makes external validity workable, and becomes therefore a preferable alternative for evaluation of health promotion/social betterment programs. The integrative validity model and the bottom-up approach enable evaluators to meet scientific and practical requirements, facilitate in advancing external validity, and gain a new perspective on methods. The new perspective also furnishes a balanced view of credible evidence, and offers an alternative perspective for funding.

This study examines gender differences in client-provider relationship as an important treatment ingredient affecting retention in treatment and reduced post-treatment substance use. The study uses data collected for the National Treatment Improvement Evaluation Study (NTIES), a prospective, cohort study of U.S. substance abuse treatment programs and their clients. Data on individual characteristics were collected at the pre-treatment interview; on client-provider relationship and services received at treatment exit; and on post-treatment drug use at 12 months post-treatment. The analytic sample consists of 3027 clients from 59 service delivery units (1922 men and 1105 women). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to assess the structural relations and causal connections between relationship and service variables and treatment outcome variables. Results indicate that a positive client-provider relationship is related directly to longer duration and reduced post-treatment drug use for the total sample and for men analyzed separately. For women, a positive client-provider relationship was related directly to treatment duration and only indirectly to reduced post-treatment drug use. The findings point to the significance of including client-provider relationship in service delivery models - both as a therapeutic element as well as an element facilitative of matching services to specific client needs.

This paper presents a description of the successful utilization-focused evaluation process. Successful strategies are summarized in three main categories: (1) motivated leadership; (2) regular, planned communication; and (3) consistent and continued commitment of all parties involved. Three main prerequisite conditions for success were found to include: (a) have in place a widely representative Evaluation Taskforce with as many, if not all, key stakeholders represented; (b) have the program of concern and the focus of the evaluation flexible enough to actually accommodate change; and (c) adhere to a pre-determined timeline.

However, incomplete enrolment and attrition over time can introduce bias. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of evaluative information on cohorts in developing countries. This paper documents various strategies adopted to minimize loss to follow up and describes a retrospective analysis of a small group of families who were missed during initial enrolment and through several subsequent rounds of data collection of the Birth to Twenty (BT20) birth cohort in Soweto-Johannesburg, South Africa that began in 1990. A purposive case study approach was used, and 10 of the 119 families missed at enrolment were interviewed to investigate why these families were not enrolled into the study. The findings demonstrate that high mobility, both within urban areas and between urban and rural areas, are a major challenge for longitudinal studies in densely populated urban areas. In addition, enrolment was also affected by individuals changing their names, largely motivated to facilitate access to employment under Apartheid, as well as varying motivations for participating in research. Longitudinal studies in the developing country context must be mindful of the political, social and economic climate that influences enrolment and ongoing cohort maintenance.

The research literature has documented the benefits of stakeholder participation in smaller-scale program evaluations. However, given the scope and diversity of projects in multi-site program evaluations, traditional notions of participatory evaluation do not apply. The purpose of this research is to determine the ways in which stakeholders are involved in large-scale, multi-site STEM evaluations. This article describes the findings from a survey of 313 program leaders and evaluators and from follow-up interviews with 12 of these individuals. Findings from this study indicate that attendance at meetings and conferences, planning discussions within the project related to use of the program evaluation, and participation in data collection should be added to the list of activities that foster feelings of evaluation involvement among stakeholders. In addition, perceptions of involvement may vary according to breadth or depth of evaluation activities, but not always both. Overall, this study suggests that despite the contextual challenges of large, multi-site evaluations, it is feasible to build feelings of involvement among stakeholders.

Despite its promise as an alternative to traditional sequential residential rehabilitation programs, supported housing has not been evaluated to an extent that supports firm conclusions concerning the efficacy of specific program elements. We conducted a comprehensive review of the literature on supported housing and similarly labeled programs, to determine the degree of clarity in the supported housing model and the degree of fidelity to that model within the empirical literature, and to determine whether lack of clarity or fidelity are barriers to widespread, systematic program implementation and evaluation. We encountered a number of limitations in the literature, including conflicting use of program labels, inconsistent definitions of supported housing and its elements, and use of inadequate measurement indices in assessing adherence to program elements. Our findings suggest that greater model clarity, better specification of model elements, and greater standardization in measurement of program dimensions would aid in supported housing program implementation and evaluation. We present a number of recommendations for the field and suggestions for future research.

Such survey methods, relying exclusively on drug use as self-reported on interviews or questionnaires, have been criticized by the United States Government Accountability Office as well as by independent experts, This paper critiques a major validity study of self-reported illicit drug use among youth commissioned by the federal government, showing that the favorable conclusions and summaries offered for public consumption are not warranted. Specifically, the findings of the validity study, which compared self-reports with urine tests, are consistent with prior research showing that self-reports substantially underestimate illicit drug use and can dramatically affect indicators of change. Thus, these national surveys are largely inadequate for evaluating national drug demand reduction policies and programs.

The necessity of multidimensional evaluation of the likely impact of policies and programmes on the territory - understood as the dimension on which all the other relevant dimensions (economic, social, environmental and cultural) converge and with which they integrate - emerged as a natural consequence of the importance of spatial aspects in the future development of the Union and of widespread preoccupations about certain emerging spatial trends. A proposal for a TIA methodology combining logical consistency vis-\u00e0-vis the Union's present institutional and policy guidelines with operational viability is being developed and applied to Trans-European Networks policy of the EU. Territorial impact is linked to an innovative definition of the objective of \"territorial cohesion\" of the Treaties in terms of territorial efficiency, quality and identity. Utilising sectoral impact studies developed inside the ESPON programme and developing territorial indicators for impact, vulnerability and desirability (territorial utility functions), a multicriteria model (TEQUILA) is implemented on priority projects as defined by the Commission, and results mapped and described for the 1360 NUTS-3 regions of the Union. 4 2009 32 11 342 350 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149-7189(09)00058-5 Camagni, Roberto oai:RePEc:eee:epplan:v:3:y:1980:i:2:p:95-1032019-08-10RePEc:eee:epplan article Systems engineering: A problem-solving approach to improving program performance 2 1980 3 1 95 103 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0149-7189(80)90057-9 Gooding, Richard Z. oai:RePEc:eee:epplan:v:20:y:1997:i:1:p:7-152019-08-10RePEc:eee:epplan article Changing roles: Evaluator and teacher collaborating in school change 1 1997 20 2 7 15 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149-7189(96)00032-8 Lau, Genevieve LeMahieu, Paul oai:RePEc:eee:epplan:v:21:y:1998:i:1:p:31-452019-08-10RePEc:eee:epplan article Consumer satisfaction of parents and their children with child/adolescent mental health services 1 1998 21 2 31 45 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149-7189(97)00043-8 Godley, Susan Harrington Fiedler, Elisa Mustari Funk, Rodney R. oai:RePEc:eee:epplan:v:27:y:2004:i:4:p:423-4312019-08-10RePEc:eee:epplan article Successfully exiting homelessness: experiences of formerly homeless mentally ill individuals 4 2004 27 11 423 431 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149-7189(04)00057-6 Thompson, Sanna J.

This position paper presents evaluator education as an initiative and provides a foundation for its evaluation. In it, the authors use Stufflebeam's Context, Input, Process, and Product (CIPP) model to frame a review of the literature and practice. We follow this analysis of the current state of evaluator education in formal settings, with discussion of its implications, and directions for future research and action. Our analysis suggests that there is much work to be done to understand the needs for evaluator education, to delineate standards for quality in both education and practice, to identify the inputs and processes most effective for addressing those needs, and to document its ultimate impacts. The paper provides a call to action for improving the quality, consistency, and integrity of this important work.

Exercise might benefit eating changes through a transfer of self-regulatory skill improvements. However, related research is minimal, and degrees of obesity might influence the utilization and efficacy of self-regulatory processes. Women of Class 1 obesity (body mass index [BMI] = 30-34.9 kg/m2; n = 53), Class 2 obesity (BMI = 35-39.9 kg/m2; n = 41), and Class 3 obesity (BMI 40 kg/m2; n = 53) enrolled in a community-based cognitive-behavioral weight-management program were assessed over 6 months on changes in exercise, self-regulation for both exercise and eating, and the consumption of fruits/vegetables and sweets. Within-group improvements were all significant, with the greater self-regulation changes consistent with lower degrees of obesity. Within serial multiple mediation analyses, the hypothesized path from exercise changeself-regulation for exercise changeself-regulation for eating changeeating behavior change was supported in both the prediction of changes in fruit/vegetable intake and sweets consumption. However, the direct effect of increased exercise on improved eating was not significant. BMI score or obesity class did not significantly moderate embedded relationships among variables. Findings suggested weight-loss programs incorporate supported exercise, and dedicate high proportions of their curricula to the development of self-regulatory skills.

National efforts exist for establishing policies, protocols, evaluation, and education for students, administrators, and staff to prevent hazing at the college level, but this work has yet to be applied broadly in a high school context. In response to this gap, researchers implemented a pilot project at two high schools in Maine that consisted of hazing prevention training and assessment. This paper discusses the design, methods, and lessons learned through this collaborative, utilization-focused, and mixed-method training and evaluation with school personnel and high school student participants.

We identified capacity building needs in the areas of training (e.g., HF principles, clinical services, landlord engagement) and technical assistance (e.g., intake coordination, client prioritization, fidelity assessment). These findings were used to tailor training and technical assessment (TTA) to the stages of HF implementation in these cities.

Results from a 3-year tribal substance use prevention program American Indian youth substance use is a major public health concern. To date, there has been limited evaluation of American Indian youth substance use prevention programs. Evaluation of prevention programs is necessary to understand the aspects of programming that are effective or not effective. This mixed-methods evaluation focuses on select outcomes of a 3-year culturally-based prevention program located in six American Indian communities in the Rocky Mountain Region. The goals of the prevention program are to reduce binge drinking by 30% and increase community readiness by 1-point over a 5- year period. In the first year of the program, community members worked with program staff to develop an evaluation plan that would measure the following outcomes: lowering substance use, increasing community readiness, and increasing the reach of prevention messaging through culturally based prevention. The primary research questions this outcome evaluation sought to answer were as follows: 1) Are there differences in American Indian youth who participate in culturally-based prevention activities compared with American Indian youth who do not participate in these activities? 2) Was the prevention program effective in increasing community readiness over a 3-year period? 3) Did community involvement in prevention activities increase overtime? Results from this evaluation indicate that substance use was similar among intervention (n = 200) and non-intervention youth (n = 369). This was somewhat surprising because Intervention youth reported higher levels of social support and community connections than non-intervention group youth. Community readiness decreased .81 point from 2015 to 2017. The reach of prevention activities increased 365% from 2015 to 2017. We provide lessons learned that may help other communities as they document outcomes related to prevention efforts. Substance use is a multi-faceted problem facing our communities, families, schools, and nation. Innovative, effective, culturally-based prevention programs like the one highlighted in this paper underscore the need for primary prevention strategies.

As teachers' role in leadership continues to be redefined, research and professional development in teacher leadership will continue to evolve. Given the lack of a clear conceptualization of teacher leadership in the empirical literature, there is a clear methodological challenge for evaluators who are charged with assessing the impact of teacher leadership professional development programs. This paper describes how both the Utilization-Focused Evaluation and Theory-Driven Evaluation frameworks were used concurrently to design evaluation methods that were effective for assessing the impact of a dynamic teacher leadership program. The evaluation is specifically situated within the context of a Robert Noyce Scholarship Program, which aimed to grow veteran science teachers into teacher leaders. The paper describes how the evaluation frameworks used guided the evaluation methods, provides illustrative evaluation results, and states lessons learned from the author's experiences working within this context.

As a result, external evaluators are placing increased focus on evaluation capacity building as a practice. However, empirical evidence of how to foster evaluation capacity in different contexts remains limited. This study presents findings from an evaluation capacity survey conducted within a multisite Empowerment Evaluation initiative, in which an external evaluator worked with 20 project teams at diverse community agencies implementing HIV prevention projects. Survey results revealed representatives from project teams (n = 33) reported significantly higher overall evaluation capacity after engaging with the external evaluator on planning and implementing their evaluation. Improvements differed across organization type, intervention type, staff position, and reported engagement on various activities throughout the course of the evaluation. Results indicated empowerment evaluation and other stakeholder-focused evaluation approaches are broadly applicable when evaluation capacity building is a desired outcome, particularly when able to engage project staff in the planning of the evaluation and in delivering technical assistance services. Accordingly, efforts should be made by program funders, staff, and evaluators to encourage active engagement starting in the early stages of program and evaluation planning.

Access to dental care is poorer for people experiencing homelessness and disadvantage due to barriers such as lengthy waiting lists, lack of transport, lack of information and fear of authorities and treatment. This study aimed to evaluate a system integration model for oral health care for clients of homeless services in Brisbane, Australia. This model aimed to provide a facilitated access pathway between homeless community organisations and a public dental service to improve access to dental care. Participants were adult (18 years) clients Brisbane homeless community organisations. Those who participated in the intervention evaluation completed a questionnaire, had their oral health screened and followed up for feedback at their dental appointment. Seventy-six clients of community organisations in Brisbane participated in the intervention and its evaluation. Fear was a barrier to accessing dental services for 23% (n = 18). Attendance to the subsequent appointments at the public dental clinic was high, with 85% (n = 64) attending their first appointment. A higher proportion of participants who had surgical and prosthodontic treatment needs at the screening did not attend their appointment compared to those with other needs. Overall the model piloted in this study had positive outcomes; with high attendance rates to the dental facility and positive experiences by participants.

Therefore, researchers should continuously propose and evaluate alternative policies that may mitigate bullying as a social issue. One such strategy that has been proposed is the use of police officers in schools, best known as School Resource Officers (SROs). The current study evaluated the efficacy of SROs as an intervention against bullying in schools in the United States. Using a longitudinal sample consisting of three years of data from the School Survey on Crime and Safety (n = 480), schools that initiated, discontinued, and continued their use of SROs from one time point to another were compared to a control group of schools. The findings indicate that SROs do not have an effect on bullying in schools. Policy implications of these findings suggest that programs that focus on components such as teaching social and emotional competency skills, improving relationships between students and adults, and creating a positive school environment may be more effective in reducing bullying than a security procedure such as the use of SROs. Alternative programs should be explored to mitigate bullying and improve the well-being of students.

These evaluative judgments are based on comparing an evaluand's performance to what the evaluand is supposed to do (criteria) and how well it is supposed to do it (standards). The aim of this four-phase study was to test whether criteria and standards can be set via crowdsourcing, a potentially cost- and time-effective approach to collecting public opinion data. In the first three phases, participants were presented with a program description, then asked to complete a task to either identify criteria (phase one), weigh criteria (phase two), or set standards (phase three). Phase four found that the crowd-generated criteria were high quality; more specifically, that they were clear and concise, complete, non-overlapping, and realistic. Overall, the study concludes that crowdsourcing has the potential to be used in evaluation for setting stable, high-quality criteria and standards. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149718918300417 Harman, Elena Azzam, Tarek oai:RePEc:eee:epplan:v:71:y:2018:i:c:p:51-572018-10-03RePEc:eee:epplan article Comparative analysis of the factors contributing to sustainability of a food and nutrition intervention programme: Two case studies from South Africa Sustainability of health interventions is a consistent and ongoing issue in Africa. Understanding key aspects of sustainable interventions provides the necessary methods for success. This research evaluates a nutrition intervention implemented in two peri-urban communities in the Free State and Gauteng province in South Africa (SA) respectively. A case study approach was employed using cross-case study analyses, including triangular data collection (empirical research through surveys of respondents; qualitative data collection through researcher journals, diaries, communications and photographs; and research team reflections). The information from these case studies is organized according to a framework from the United States (US) Office of Organizational Health (OAH) to evaluate the sustainability of intervention programmes. All eight of the OAH criteria were met in the Free State community and supported the importance of these key factors for sustainability compared to only three in the Gauteng community. The OAH framework provided a compelling rationale for the relative success of the intervention and clearly showed the Free State project was sustainable. The Gauteng project was not sustainable. Planned interventions should devote significant effort and time towards ensuring sustainability. The OAH guidelines provide key steps that the research shows is relevant to the South African context.

This article situates the project vita as a knowledge management tool for use by large-scale research and development projects or coalitions. In such complex endeavors, the variety and scope of the knowledge generated can quickly outpace project staff attempts to collect, classify, disseminate, and support the effective use of the constant stream of information being produced.

Peer support and services is critical component, providing a transformational space from basic survival into recovery, supporting personal development and skills building and further social development. This study demonstrates that adult public mental health consumers actively receiving services can engage in collaborative research in meaningfully determining what their needs are, conceptualizing what the services should be and how developed, and articulating service prioritization.

Indashyikirwa is a blended approach of evidence-based programming, primarily drawing on SASA! developed by Raising Voices in Uganda, as well as program innovations. Indashyikirwa consists of four major components; 1) a five-month curriculum with couples to support equitable, non-violent relationships, 2) supporting a sub-set of trained couples to engage in community activism for an additional two years, 3) establishment of women's safe spaces for dedicated support and referral of IPV survivors, 4) training and engaging opinion leaders to support an enabling environment for IPV prevention and response. This paper is based on implementation experience and qualitative evaluation research conducted at various time points with trained couples, women's safe space attendees and facilitators, opinion leaders and programme staff, as well as observations of program activities.

In the current manuscript, we present the results of a literature search of peer-reviewed articles in health-related research where concept mapping was used in collaboration with the community. A total of 103 articles met the inclusion criteria. We first address how community engagement was defined in the articles and then focus on the articles describing high community engagement and the associated community outcomes/benefits and methodological challenges. A majority (61%; n=63) of the articles were classified as low to moderate community engagement and participation while 38% (n=39) of the articles were classified as high community engagement and participation. The results of this literature review enhance our understanding of how concept mapping can be used in direct collaboration with communities and highlights the many potential benefits for both researchers and communities.

From initial discussions with graduate students, through the rise of the theory-driven approach to program evaluation and the development of a theoretical framework for conceptualization methodology, the paper highlights some of the key early efforts and pilot projects that culminated in a 1989 special issue on the method in Evaluation and Program Planning that brought the method to the attention of the field of evaluation. The paper details the thinking that led to the standard version of the method (the analytic sequence, \"bridging\" index, and pattern matching) and the development of the software for accomplishing it. A bibliometric analysis shows that the rate of citation continues to increase, where it has grown geographically and institutionally, that the method has been used in a wide variety of disciplines and specialties, and that the literature had an influence on the field. The article concludes with a critical appraisal of some of the key aspects of the approach that warrant further development.

The UK-based program aimed to reduce CO2 emissions and encourage behavioral change through community-led environmental projects. It, thus, employed six community development facilitators, with expertise in environmental issues. These facilitators supported and learnt from 18 community groups over an 18-month period. The paper explores the narratives of the six professional facilitators. These facilitators discuss their experiences of supporting community groups. They also explain their contribution to the wider evaluation of the community-led projects. This paper reflects on the facilitator experience of the program's outcome-led evaluation process. In turn, it also explores how the groups they supported experienced the process. The facilitator's narratives reveal that often community-group objectives did not align with predefined outcomes established through theory of change or logic model methodologies, which had been devised in attempt to align to program funder aims. Assisting community action emerges in this inquiry as a stochastic art that requires funder and facilitator willingness to experiment and openness to the possibilities of learning from failure. Drawing on in-depth accounts, the article illustrates that a reflexive, interpretive evaluation approach can enhance learning opportunities and provides funders with more trustworthy representations of community-led initiatives. Yet, it also addresses why such an approach remains marginal within policy circles. Community-led; Climate change; Failure; Program evaluation; 122 Dunkley, Ria A.

Cognitive style could explain diversity in the participants' behaviour in different phases of the GCM process. At the same time, the concept map as a group's common cognitive construct can consolidate individual differences and serves as a tool for managing diversity in groups of participants. Some of the results were that: (a) the more adaptive participants generated ideas that fit to a particular, well-established and consensually agreed paradigm, frame of reference, theory or practice; (b) the more innovative participants produced ideas that were more general in scope and required changing a settled structure (paradigm, frame of reference, theory or practice); and (c) the empirical comparison of the map configurations through Procrustes analysis indicated a strong dissimilarity between cognitive styles.

Ideas about health literacy were generated by 99 experts and resulted in 105 statements that were subsequently organized by 27 experts in an unstructured card sorting. Multidimensional scaling was applied to the sorting data and a two and three-dimensional solution was computed. The three dimensional solution was used in subsequent cluster analysis and resulted in a concept map of nine \"clusters\": (1) self-regulation, (2) self-perception, (3) proactive approach to health, (4) basic literacy and numeracy skills, (5) information appraisal, (6) information search, (7) health care system knowledge and acting, (8) communication and cooperation, and (9) beneficial personality traits. Subsequently, this concept map served as a starting point for developing a \"qualitative\" structural model of health literacy and a questionnaire for the measurement of health literacy. On the basis of questionnaire data, a \"quantitative\" structural model was created by first applying exploratory factor analyses (EFA) and then cross-validating the model with confirmatory factor analyses (CFA). Concept mapping proved to be a highly valuable tool for the process of model building up to translational research in the \"real world\".

Since then, the application of concept mapping has spread widely and an easy prediction for the future is that this trend is likely to continue; a more important and greater challenge is to think about the ways in which concept mapping may and should evolve. Discussed here are thoughts about the future of concept mapping including some predictions of likely directions and suggestions for new possibilities. Thoughts on the future are grounded in concept mapping applications that have emerged and gained ground in recent years; these include exploring wicked problems in communities and integrating concept mapping with other methods of inquiry. Thoughts on the future are also grounded in the social and cultural milieu in which we find ourselves at this time. The influence of social media and internet technologies has led to the emergence peer production and crowdsourcing as approaches to co-create information, knowledge, products and services. These tactics may create fertile ground for the further spread of concept mapping. This same collaborative milieu has produced the open software movement which in turn, offers opportunities to enhancing the methodology of concept mapping.

A collection of concept mapping projects conducted in the Netherlands was identified, in part in the archive of the Netherlands Institute of Mental Health and Addiction (Trimbos Institute). Some of the 90 identified projects are internationally published. The 90 concept mapping projects reflect the changes in mental health care and can be grouped into 5-year periods and into five typologies. The studies range from conceptualizing the problems of the homeless to the specification of quality indicators for treatment programs for patients with cystic fibrosis. The number of concept mapping projects has varied over time. Growth has been considerable in the last 5 years compared to the previous 5 years. Three case studies are described in detail with 12 characteristics and graphical representations. Concept mapping aligns well with the typical Dutch approach of the \"Poldermodel.\" A broad introduction of concept mapping in European countries in cooperation with other countries, such as the United States and Canada, would strengthen the empirical basis for applying this approach in health care policy, quality, and clinical work.

Fusing and organizing many different ideas, opinions, and interpretations into a coherent and acceptable plan or project evaluation is challenging. This is especially true when seeking contributions from a large number of participants, especially when not all can participate in group discussions, or when some prefer to contribute their perspectives anonymously. One of the major breakthroughs in the area of evaluation and program planning has been the use of graphical tools to represent the brainstorming process. This provides a quantitative framework for organizing ideas and general concepts into simple-to-interpret graphs. We developed a new, open-source concept mapping software called R-CMap, which is implemented in R. This software provides a graphical user interface to guide users through the analytical process of concept mapping. The R-CMap software allows users to generate a variety of plots, including cluster maps, point rating and cluster rating maps, as well as pattern matching and go-zone plots. Additionally, R-CMap is capable of generating detailed reports that contain useful statistical summaries of the data. The plots and reports can be embedded in Microsoft Office tools such as Word and PowerPoint, where users may manually adjust various plot and table features to achieve the best visual results in their presentations and official reports. The graphical user interface of R-CMap allows users to define cluster names, change the number of clusters, select rating variables for relevant plots, and importantly, select subsets of respondents by demographic criteria. The latter is particularly useful to project managers in order to identify different patterns of preferences by subpopulations. R-CMap is user-friendly, and does not require any programming experience. However, proficient R users can add to its functionality by directly accessing built-in functions in R and sharing new features with the concept mapping community.

However, when the evaluation sample does not reflect a program's intended audience, the discrepancy may lead to evaluation results that are not valid for that audience. We conducted evaluation activities for a state Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program-Education (SNAP-Ed) intervention that promotes consumption of fruits and vegetables (F&V) in low-income areas. Previous program evaluations efforts had failed to obtain a sufficient proportion of individuals identified as low-income based on their participation in SNAP. We used state Medicaid data as a means of identifying low-income families to recruit for a telephone survey (n=311) and an in-depth qualitative interview (n=30) that we designed for the program being evaluated. We chose to focus on the dynamics of parent-child communication around F&V because we considered this previously unevaluated component of the intervention vital to understanding program effectiveness. Our results indicated that the Medicaid database provided an appropriate sample and that parents reported frequent F&V requests from their children. Parents also reported that they would positively respond to requests in many different settings, such as grocery stores (92.6%), restaurants (88.1%), and fast Elizabeth H. Baquero, Barbara Momany, T.

Consensus seems to be emerging regarding the need for national strategies to improve water sector capacity development. This paper analyses the dynamics of actors' interactions and their characteristics (motivation, cognition and power) during the formulation and implementation of a specific capacity development strategy, namely the Water Sector Skills Plan (SSP) in South Africa. Based on the Contextual Interactive Theory and empirical findings, our analysis indicates slow progression and challenges with implementing the SSP, mainly due to the lack of consultation with key stakeholders during the formulation stage, a lack of data sharing among the target group (the Sector Education Training Authorities), and a lack of capacities within the key implementing organizations. These policy dynamics need to be taken into account when advocating for national capacity development strategies as a solution for challenges with water sector capacity development. The paper proposes the recommendations that are of relevance for the SSP as well as similar initiatives in other countries.

Seven published concept mapping projects are detailed to document how each of the phases were modified to meet the specific aims of each project. Concept mapping was found to be a useful tool to complement public health roles such as assessment, program development, and priority setting. The phases of concept mapping allow for a blending of diverse perspectives, which is critical to public health efforts. The adaptability of concept mapping permits the use of multiple modalities such as the addition of face-to-face brainstorming; use of qualitative methods, including structured interviews; and review and use of published literature and guidelines. Another positive aspect of concept mapping for public health practice is its ability to identify program elements, provide a visual map of generated ideas and their relationships to one another, and assist in identifying priorities. Our reflections on the adaptability should help inform another generation in designing concept mapping projects and related products that may benefit from unique adaptations and the rapidly expanding social media technology and platforms.

Few health promotion programs target the group home setting which is the pre-dominant form of residential accommodation for persons with intellectual disability. A process evaluation of a physical activity health promotion program, Menu-Choice, was conducted with five group home sites for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Menu-Choice assists group home staff in including physical activity goals within resident schedules. The physical activity program was designed based on theoretical frameworks, community-based participatory approaches, and established health promotion guidelines for adults with disabilities. Fourteen program coordinators (age M 39; 77% females), 22 staff (age M 39; 82% females), and 18 residents (age M 59; 72% females; 56% ambulatory) participated. Results from the fidelity survey and program completion highlight potential challenges with implementation.

The purpose, application, and utility of concept mapping have varied across this emerging literature. Despite the variety of uses and range of outputs, little has been done to critically review how researchers have approached the application of concept mapping in the measurement development and evaluation process. This article focuses on a review of the current state of practice regarding the use of concept mapping as methodological tool in this process. We systematically reviewed 23 scale or measure development and evaluation studies, and detail the application of concept mapping in the context of traditional measurement development and psychometric testing processes. Although several limitations surfaced, we found several strengths in the contemporary application of the method. We determined concept mapping provides (a) a solid method for establishing content validity, (b) facilitates researcher decision-making, (c) insight into target population perspectives that are integrated a priori, and (d) a foundation for analytical and interpretative choices. Based on these results, we outline how concept mapping can be situated in the measurement development and evaluation processes for new instrumentation.

A comprehensive search produced a set of 108 eligible dissertations; of which 104 were available as full-text or hard copy. The studies were coded on 77 variables, which were summarized in descriptive analyses. The dissertations were conducted in a wide variety of topic areas and completed at 35 different universities in the US and Canada. On comparable variables, the results were similar to two prior syntheses (Trochim, 1993; Rosas & Kane, 2012). The mean multidimensional scaling analysis stress value for 96 concept maps was 0.26 with a standard deviation of 0.05. Cumulative rates of dissertation completion and resulting citations of the dissertations and any resulting articles were plotted over the study period.

Multidisciplinary interventions working to close this gap may benefit from incorporating an empirically supported treatment (EST) into their approach that targets a universal mechanism implicated in resilience, like attachment. ESTs should be selected based on their level of empirical support and cultural adaptability, and then modified on the basis of qualitative evaluations conducted with the local population and stakeholders. This paper will provide an overview of attachment as a mechanism of resilience, a critical analysis of existing attachment-based ESTs, and recommendations for overcoming EST implementation barriers in LMIC.

Despite obvious needs and some NGO presence in the bateyes, little assessment has been done to identify specific needs as understood and experienced by community members themselves. This article describes a community health needs assessment and action planning process developed and implemented by university researchers, NGO staff, and community members to identify needed areas for community-based health intervention in seven Dominican bateyes. Surveys and focus groups were used to collect data about the needs and assets of the bateyes and their residents around the following broad topics: demographics, health, education, financial/economy, legal issues, and transportation/infrastructure. These data were then used to guide an action-planning process that identified clean water, access to food and nutritional diversity, and economic development as primary and immediate needs in the communities. The process, its outcomes, and lessons learned are discussed.

The broader set of systems thinking methodologies (of which GCM is one), have only recently found their way into the field. We present an overview of systems thinking emerging from a system dynamics (SD) perspective, and illustrate the potential synergy between GCM and SD. As with GCM, participatory processes are frequently employed when building SD models; however, it can be challenging to engage a large and diverse group of stakeholders in the iterative cycles of divergent thinking and consensus building required, while maintaining a broad perspective on the issue being studied. GCM provides a compelling resource for overcoming this challenge, by richly engaging a diverse set of stakeholders in broad exploration, structuring, and prioritization. SD provides an opportunity to extend GCM findings by embedding constructs in a testable hypothesis (SD model) describing how system structure and changes in constructs affect outcomes over time. SD can be used to simulate the hypothesized dynamics inherent in GCM concept maps. We illustrate the potential of the marriage of these methodologies in a case study of BECOMING, a federally-funded program aimed at strengthening the cross-sector system of care for youth with severe emotional disturbances.

Participants (n=197) were predominantly white, middle-aged, college-educated women. At 12 weeks, 73.2% had read 90% of the program materials (at nine months>70% had \"occasionally\" or \"often\" looked back over each of the five parts of the materials); 63.3% had set goals (52.5% at nine months), and 83.9% had \"some\" or \"a lot\" of success following their plan (64.2% at nine months), while 90.4% rated the program \"good\" or \"excellent\" (87.5% at nine months). At 12 weeks, the majority (89.3%) used written logs to self-monitor (mean=9.3 logs); by nine months, >70% never kept logs. Most (>80%) rated twelve of thirteen program components as helpful, and 98.6% would recommend the program. From 38% to 62.4% endorsed each of eight program benefits, with small declines of 9% at nine months. Qualitative response identified ways the program met and did not meet expectations.

There are insufficient practices in existing EA evaluation models in terms of considering all EA functions and processes, using structured methods in developing EA implementation, employing matured practices, and using appropriate metrics to achieve proper evaluation. The aim of this research is to develop a hybrid evaluation method that supports achieving the objectives of EA implementation. To attain this aim, the first step is to identify EA implementation evaluation practices. To this end, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted. Second, the proposed hybrid method was developed based on the foundation and information extracted from the SLR, semi-structured interviews with EA practitioners, program theory evaluation and Information Systems (ISs) evaluation. Finally, the proposed method was validated by means of a case study and expert reviews.

However, research regarding validity of knowledge and outcomes produced with concept mapping is sparse. The current study describes quantitative validity analyses using a concept mapping dataset. We sought to increase the validity of concept mapping evaluation results by running multiple cluster analysis methods and then using several metrics to choose from among solutions. We present four different clustering methods based on analyses using the R statistical software package: partitioning around medoids (PAM), fuzzy analysis (FANNY), agglomerative nesting (AGNES) and divisive analysis (DIANA). We then used the Dunn and Davies-Bouldin indices to assist in choosing a valid cluster solution for a concept mapping outcomes evaluation. We conclude that the validity of the outcomes map is high, based on the analyses described. Finally, we discuss areas for further concept mapping methods research.

A limited number of evaluation capacity measurement instruments have been validated in government or non-government organisations (NGO), however there is no instrument designed for health promotion organisations. This study aimed to develop and validate an Evaluation Practice Analysis Survey (EPAS) to examine evaluation practices in health promotion organisations. Qualitative interviews, existing frameworks and instruments informed the survey development. Health promotion practitioners from government agencies and NGOs completed the survey (n = 169). Principal components analysis was used to determine scale structure and Cronbach's used to estimate internal reliability. Logistic regression was conducted to assess predictive validity of selected EPAS scale. The final survey instrument included 25 scales (125 items). The EPAS demonstrated good internal reliability ( > 0.7) for 23 scales. Dedicated resources and time for evaluation, leadership, organisational culture and internal support for evaluation showed promising predictive validity. The EPAS can be used to describe elements of evaluation capacity at the individual, organisational and system levels and to guide initiatives to improve evaluation practice in health promotion organisations.

An effective community health promotion program is needed but there is a lack of knowledge of community barriers and health factors affecting children's health in these migrant villages. The purpose of this study was to conduct a community health needs assessment to develop strategies for a child health promotion program in these migrant villages. This study conducted using a mixed method that included literature review, reginal statistics, focus group and key person interviews, and a community survey. The analysis method was descriptive statistics for the questionnaires, and content analysis for the interviews. Results showed the following priorities for child health promotion: strengthening health care provider capacity, overcoming resource shortages, managing child health and preventable diseases, improving public hygiene, promoting a healthy lifestyle, and empowering school health.

Obesity prevention strategies have not been effective, and currently, Mexico has one of the highest prevalence of childhood obesity. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop strategies that can prevent childhood obesity and also to avoid these children to remain overweight/obese through adulthood. The objective of this study was to provide a step-by-step description of the design, implementation and evaluation of an intervention plan for Mexican mothers of school aged children to promote healthy eating and to prevent childhood obesity. The program Ni\u00f1o Sano Adulto Sano was developed using the Intervention Mapping Approach and the Social Cognitive Theory frameworks to provide Mexican mothers with knowledge and skills to positively modify their children's food behavior, thus preventing future weight gain. The program was developed, piloted and delivered to the target population with positive results on the mothers' nutrition knowledge and children's BMI. Intervention Mapping and Social Cognitive Theory are useful models to design and deliver an intervention that provides a holistic approach to promote healthy eating.

While logic models have been used in many ways to support evaluation, and data visualization has been used widely to present and communicate evaluation findings, adopting logic models for portfolio evaluation and using data visualization to share findings simultaneously is surprisingly limited in the literature. With the data from a sample portfolio of 209 projects which aims to improve the system of early care and education (ECE), this study illustrated how to use logic model and data visualization techniques to conduct a portfolio evaluation by answering two evaluation questions: \"To what extent are the elements of a logic model (strategies, sub-strategies, activities, outcomes, and impacts) reflected in the sample portfolio?\" and \"Which dominant paths through the logic model were illuminated by the data visualization technique?\" For the first question, the visualization technique illuminated several dominant strategies, sub-strategies, activities, and outcomes. For the second question, our visualization techniques made it convenient to identify critical paths through the logic model. Implications for both program evaluation and program planning were discussed.

A remote Aboriginal community initiated a collaboration to work towards elimination of RHD. Based in 'both-way learning' (reciprocal knowledge co-creation), the aim of this study was to co-design, implement and evaluate community-based participatory action research (CBPAR) to achieve this vision. Activities related to understanding and addressing RHD social determinants were delivered through an accredited course adapted to meet learner and project needs. Theory-driven evaluation linking CBPAR to empowerment was applied. Data collection comprised focus groups, interviews, observation, and co-development and use of measurement tools such as surveys. Data analysis utilised process indicators from national guidelines for Aboriginal health research, and outcome indicators derived from the Wallerstein framework. Findings include the importance of valuing traditional knowledges and ways of learning such as locally-meaningful metaphors to explore unfamiliar concepts; empowerment through critical thinking and community ownership of knowledge about RHD and research; providing practical guidance in implementing empowering and decolonising principles / theories. Lessons learned are applicable to next stages of the RHD elimination strategy which must include scale-up of community leadership in research agenda-setting and implementation. action knowledge co-creation; Knowledge Phillips, Jodi Bessarab, Dawn Walker, Roz Cook, Jeff Ralph, Anna P. oai:RePEc:eee:epplan:v:74:y:2019:i:c:p:102-1092019-05-02RePEc:eee:epplan article Pathways to becoming an internal evaluator: Perspectives from the Australian non-government sector There is a lack of clarity around intra-organisational evaluation roles and pathways into these roles in non-government organisations (NGOs). This article presents three auto-narratives from the authors who are working as internal evaluators in the NGO sector. We examine this phenomenon of role ambiguity by exploring our evaluation journeys and struggles to find identities in the formal evaluation community. Findings from the auto-narratives identify implications for the evaluation field regarding professionalisation. This article explores how aspects of professionalisation, such as clarification of roles and tasks of internal evaluators, could facilitate their recruitment, assess credibility and guide career trajectory. Elucidating internal evaluation career pathways contributes to the evaluation discipline by providing information relevant for evaluation capacity building, evaluator training, and the professionalisation movement.

Yet, there is a paucity of evidence about programs that successfully develop competent frontline managers to navigate these complex systems. There is even less evidence about developing frontline managers in areas of contextual complexity such as geographically remote and isolated health services. This study used a customised management development program containing continuous quality improvement (CQI) approaches to determine whether additional levels of evaluation could provide evidence for program impact. Generalisability is limited by the small sample size; however, the findings suggest that continuous improvement approaches, such as action learning workplace-based CQI projects not only provide for real-world application of the manager's learning; they can potentially produce the type of data needed to conduct evaluations for organisational impact and cost-benefits. The case study contributes to the literature in an area where there is a scarcity of empirical research. Further, this study proposes a pragmatic method for using CQI approaches with existing management development programs to generate the type of data needed for multi-level evaluation.

Identifying health behaviors and disparities in underserved communities is needed to guide the development of targeted interventions. The Community Assessment for Public Health Emergency Response (CASPER) is a set of tools designed for public health emergencies, but the utility of CASPER in non-emergency settings has not been explored. The purpose of this study was to use CASPER to obtain information on household-based behaviors of and barriers to fruit/vegetable consumption and physical activity, and explore the utility of these methods for future health assessments. Cross-sectional survey data included households (n=100) in a low-income neighborhood. Half of adults did not meet recommendations for fruit/vegetable consumption and 20% reported no physical activity during the previous week. Cost was significantly associated with healthy eating and physical activity in our community. Four primary advantages of using CASPER methodology included a user-friendly CDC toolkit, yield of a representative community sample with a relatively low sample size, low-cost/low-tech requirements for implementation, and the strengthening of an academic-practice-community partnership. Our work demonstrates the utility of CASPER for assessing healthy living in a geographically-defined community where household health behaviors and barriers are unknown.

Consenting employees with disabilities (18years) at two worksites in South Australia underwent dental examinations at baseline, three and six months. Referrals were arranged as needed to public dental clinics. At one and two months a dental hygienist provided group oral health education to the employees. Employees' demographics, self-rated oral health, dental behaviours and OHRQol were collected via face-to-face interviews. Of the 39 referred employees, 28 (72%) of them completed the recommended treatment. Self-rated oral health improved and there were significant reductions in the prevalence of oral health impact on quality of life (percentage of employees reporting 1+ items fairly/very often) from 27% to 11% (McNemar's test, p<0.05); the extent of impact (mean number of items reported fairly/very often) from 1.3 to 0.6 and the severity of impact (mean of summed OHIP item scores) from 3.6 to 1.8 (paired t-tests, p<0.01). As this pilot study indicates that enabling urgent referral for treatment and regular oral health education can improve OHRQol and self-rated oral health among employees with disabilities, a larger study with a control group should be undertaken.

A definition is provided of a CSP drawing on examples from different fields, and an evaluation case is analyzed in depth to derive seven (7) major sources of complexity that typify CSPs, threatening assumptions of textbook-recommended experimental designs for performing impact evaluations. Theoretically-supported, alternative methodological strategies are discussed to navigate assumptions and counter the design challenges posed by the complex configurations and ecology of CSPs. Specific recommendations include: sequential refinement of the evaluation design through systems thinking, systems-informed logic modeling; and use of extended term, mixed methods (ETMM) approaches with exploratory and confirmatory phases of the evaluation. In the proposed approach, logic models are refined through direct induction and interactions with stakeholders. To better guide assumption evaluation, question-framing, and selection of appropriate methodological strategies, a multiphase evaluation design is recommended.

In 2013, the CDLI initiated The Evaluation for Learning and Dialogue Project to provide the opportunity for organizations and supporters to work together to establish a shared vision and goals through discussions about evaluation learning and outcomes. It was intended that the project would be a useful learning tool for participating organizations by enabling them to engage in an evaluative methodological process, and record relevant information and to compare and learn from each other's projects. Outcome Harvesting was chosen as the evaluation methodology for the project. This article reviews critical learning from the project on the use of Outcome Harvesting methodology in the evaluation learning and outcomes of local community development projects, and it provides lessons for other jurisdictions interested in implementing this methodology.

Collectively, the authors provide a broad overview of existing and emerging approaches to the articulation and use of assumptions in evaluation theory and practice. The authors reiterate the rationale and key terminology as a common basis for working with assumption in program design and evaluation. They highlight some useful concepts and categorizations to promote more rigorous treatment of assumptions in evaluation. A three-tier framework for fostering agency for assumption-aware evaluation practice is proposed-agency for themselves (evaluators); agency for others (stakeholders); and agency for standards and principles.

The tools we use as evaluators are the primary artifacts of our profession, reflect our practice and embody an amalgamation of paradigms and assumptions. With the increasing shifts in evaluation purposes from judging program worth to understanding how programs work, the evaluator's role is changing to that of facilitating stakeholders in a learning process. This involves clarifying purposes and choices, as well as unearthing critical assumptions. In such a role, evaluators become major tool-users and begin to innovate with small refinements or produce completely new tools to fit a specific challenge or context.

The use of a transformative philosophical framework is presented as a way for evaluators to become more aware of the implications of various assumptions made by themselves and program stakeholders. The argument is examined and demonstrated that evaluators who are aware of the assumptions that underlie their evaluation choices are able to provide useful support for stakeholders in the examination of the assumptions they hold with regard to the nature of the problem being addressed, the program designed to solve the problem, and the approach to evaluation that is appropriate in that context. Such an informed approach has the potential for development of more appropriate and culturally responsive programs being implemented in ways that lead to the desired impacts, as well as to lead to evaluation approaches that support effective solutions to intransigent social problems. These arguments are illustrated through examples of evaluations from multiple sectors; additional challenges are also identified.

Theories of program reflect assumptions on how to conceptualize an intervention program for evaluation purposes, while theories of evaluation reflect assumptions on how to design useful evaluation. These two types of theories are related, but often discussed separately. This paper attempts to use three theoretical perspectives (reductionism, systems thinking, and pragmatic synthesis) to interface them and discuss the implications for evaluation practice. Reductionism proposes that an intervention program can be broken into crucial components for rigorous analyses; systems thinking view an intervention program as dynamic and complex, requiring a holistic examination. In spite of their contributions, reductionism and systems thinking represent the extreme ends of a theoretical spectrum; many real-world programs, however, may fall in the middle. Pragmatic synthesis is being developed to serve these moderate- complexity programs. These three theoretical perspectives have their own strengths and challenges. Knowledge on these three perspectives and their evaluation implications can provide a better guide for designing fruitful evaluations, improving the quality of evaluation practice, informing potential areas for developing cutting-edge evaluation approaches, and contributing to advancing program evaluation toward a mature applied science.

Assessing African American caregiver's perceptions of childhood obesity in rural communities is an important prevention effort. This article's objective is to describe the development and psychometric testing of a survey tool to assess childhood obesity perceptions among African American caregivers in a rural setting, which can be used for obesity prevention program development or evaluation. The Childhood Obesity Perceptions (COP) survey was developed to reflect the multidimensional nature of childhood obesity including risk factors, health complications, weight status, built environment, and obesity prevention strategies. A 97-item survey was pretested and piloted with the priority population. After pretesting and piloting, the survey was reduced to 59-items and administered to 135 African American caregivers. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to test how well the survey items represented the number of Social Cognitive Theory constructs. Twenty items were removed from the original 59-item survey and acceptable internal consistency of the six factors (=0.70-0.85) was documented for all scales in the final COP instrument. CFA resulted in a less than adequate fit; however, a multivariate Lagrange multiplier test identified modifications to improve the model fit. The COP survey represents a promising approach as a potentially comprehensive assessment for implementation or evaluation of childhood obesity programs.

But the authors note that currently, there is no integrative framework for evaluating the training programs, although it is crucial for improving program implementation and developing knowledge and theories related to travel training. Therefore, this research aims to build an integrative theory-driven evaluation framework of the programs on the basis of prior studies on travel training and the literature on program evaluation and learning and training theories. The framework considers (1) a wide range of key elements related to the delivery systems and outcomes of travel training; (2) diverse stakeholders that engage in designing, operating, and assessing travel training; and (3) the short-term, intermediate, and long-term outcomes of the programs. Based on the framework, the authors develop a flexible logic model for travel training programs to help scholars and practitioners design and conduct actual evaluation studies. Thus, this research is expected to make theoretical and practical contributions to theory-driven program evaluation and travel training programs.

We focus specifically on one component of our ET promotion approach involving the creation and analysis of theory of change (ToC) models. We describe our recent efforts to pilot this ET ECB approach with Catholic Relief Services (CRS) in Ethiopia and Zambia. The use of ToC models, plus the addition of ET, is a way to encourage individual and organizational learning and adaptive management that supports more reflective and responsive programming.

A trauma-informed public behavioral health system that emphasizes core principles such as understanding trauma, promoting safety, supporting consumer autonomy, sharing power, and ensuring cultural competence, is needed to support traumatized youth and the providers who work with them. This article describes a case study of the creation and evaluation of a trauma-informed publicly funded behavioral health system for children and adolescents in the City of Philadelphia (the Philadelphia Alliance for Child Trauma Services; PACTS) using the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment (EPIS) as a guiding framework. We describe our evaluation of this effort with an emphasis on implementation determinants and outcomes. Implementation determinants include inner context factors, specifically therapist knowledge and attitudes (N=114) towards evidence-based practices. Implementation outcomes include rate of PTSD diagnoses in agencies over time, number of youth receiving TF-CBT over time, and penetration (i.e., number of youth receiving TF-CBT divided by the number of youth screening positive on trauma screening). We describe lessons learned from our experiences building a trauma-informed public behavioral health system in the hopes that this case study can guide other similar efforts.

However, recruiting participants to health education programs and ensuring the continuity of health education for underserved populations is often challenging. The goals of this study are: to describe the attendance of health education programs; to identify stages of change to a healthy lifestyle; to determine cues to action; and to specify factors affecting perceived benefits and barriers to healthy food choices and physical activity among uninsured primary care patients. Uninsured primary care patients utilizing a free clinic (N=621) completed a self-administered survey from September to December of 2015. US born English speakers, non-US born English speakers, and Spanish speakers reported different kinds of cues to action in attending health education programs. While self-efficacy increases perceived benefits and decreases perceived barriers for physical activity, it increases both perceived benefits and perceived barriers for healthy food choices. The participants who had attended health education programs did not believe that there were benefits for healthy food choices and physical activity. This study adds to the body of literature on health education for underserved populations.

Knowledge about sexually transmitted infections (STIs), attitudes towards HIV, intention to use condoms, and sexual behavior were evaluated. Results indicated that adolescents receiving the intervention displayed improved STI knowledge (p<0.001) and improved attitudes toward HIV (p<0.05) as compared to the control group. Between the two intervention groups, a high-fidelity group intended to engage more in safe sex behaviors (p=0.05) and displayed greater STI knowledge (p=0.05) as compared to the low-fidelity group.

In educational institutions, the purpose of education is producing knowledgeable students and improving quality of the university system. Among many evaluation models, the CIPP model or Context, Input, Process, Product model is very beneficial and recommendable method to educational evaluation. This is a descriptive study conducted in four selected faculties of Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS) (Public health, Nursing and Midwifery, Rehabilitation and Allied Medical Sciences), undergraduate educational departments in 2014. This research found out quality level of undergraduates courses in viewpoint of students and graduates and determined their weak points. Data were collected through researcher- made questionnaires. Collected data were then analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.

Documenting and interpreting this conversation are necessary to advance our understanding of the significance of using STCS in planning, implementing, and evaluating social interventions. Guided by a generic framework for evaluation practice, this paper reports on an inter-disciplinary literature review and argues that STCS raises some new ways of thinking about and carrying out the following six activities: 1) supporting social problem solving; 2) framing interventions and contexts; 3) selecting and using methods; 4) engaging in valuing; 5) producing and justifying knowledge; and 6) facilitating use. Following a discussion of these issues, future directions for research and practice are suggested.

We expand on this research by exploring the utility of a GSV-based neighborhood audit to measure and match target and comparison study areas. We developed a GSV-based inventory to measure characteristics of retail alcohol stores and their surrounding neighborhoods. We assessed its reliability and assessed the utility of GSV-based audits for matching target and comparison study areas. We found that GSV-based neighborhood audits can be a useful, reliable, and cost-effective tool for matching target and comparison study areas when archival data are insufficient and primary data collection is prohibitive. We suggest that researchers focus on characteristics that are easily visible on GSV and are relatively stable over time when creating future GSV-based measuring and matching tools. Dividing the study area into small segments may also provide more accurate measurements and more precise matching.

These groups inspect policies and practices related to child protection responsibilities and are tasked with making recommendations for systemic improvement. Despite the federal mandate for each state to develop a CRP and the potential of these groups to positively impact child welfare practices, there is a dearth in the literature related to CRPs. Consequently, planning and evaluation processes of these groups vary widely. This study reports on the use of concept mapping (CM) to outline a framework for planning and subsequently evaluating the CRP in one southeastern state. CM is a mixed-method research approach that uses multi-dimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analyses to explore an area of study. Through these analyses, the method creates visual depictions of conceptual relationships between ideas. Data yielded a seven cluster concept map that CRP members (N=36) utilized for planning processes, and subsequently for developing an internal evaluation tool. Results from this study offer a unifying framework by which CRPs, and similar groups in other areas can utilize for planning and evaluation purposes. After a review of pertinent literature on CRPs, this article explicates CM processes utilized in this study, describes results, discusses lessons learned, and outlines apposite areas for future CRP research.

To promote this understanding, evaluators can work collaboratively with organization staff and leaderships to gather information on program implementation, adaptations, organizational buy-in, and project outcomes. In 2011, SAMHSA funded two Miami health clinics to implement integrated care models in co-located settings. Changes in the federal healthcare landscape, non-Medicaid expansion for Florida, and the complexity of projects goals led evaluators to facilitate a core component review as part of evaluation. A manual was developed throughout the project and captured a description, adaptations, inputs needed, lessons learned, and sustainability for each integrated care component. To increase chances for program success, evaluators should institute a method to better define core components of new programs and implementation adaptations, while keeping program replication in mind. Breaking down the program structurally gave the evaluation utility for stakeholders, and ultimately served as a resource for organizations to better understand their program model. The manual also continues to serve as a dissemination and replication source for other providers looking to implement integrated care.

Furthermore, these interventions are rarely built on explicit theoretical foundations, making their critical analysis difficult, even a posteriori. For these reasons, it appeared relevant to revisit the results of a qualitative evaluation undertaken in the province of Quebec in parallel with a Canada-wide randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating various KB strategies in public health. This paper looks critically at the theoretical foundations of the KB interventions in light of two conceptual models: (1) the dissemination model underlying the KB interventions used in the Canadian trial and (2) a systemic KB model developed later. This critical analysis sheds light on the processes involved in KB interventions and the factors influencing their implementation and effects. The conclusions of the critical analysis are consistent with the systemic model, in which interpersonal contact is an essential condition for effective KB interventions. This analysis may advance knowledge in the field by enhancing our understanding of the role of knowledge brokers as essential mediators in KB processes and outcomes.

Clinicians applied to learn Child-Parent Psychotherapy (CPP), imported to Israel from the U.S. A focus group of six graduates of a CPP training program responded to questions concerning their experiences learning and using CPP. All 39 CPP graduates from two cohorts also completed a cross sectional survey related to their use of CPP. Within the focus group, the openness of the workplace and the intervention's characteristics were considered major factors impacting CPP use; the training program was perceived to promote CPP implementation, and lack of supervision and secondary traumatic stress were the major inhibiting factors. Using CPP-informed therapy, as opposed to CPP with fidelity, was perceived to be one of the main outcomes of the training. Survey results showed that 53% of graduates were using CPP in over three cases, and almost all intended to use CPP within the next year. Ninety-five percent were using CPP principles in their therapeutic work.

The ACE-IS was established as an efficient mechanism to collect and document ACE research and programmatic activities. Performance indicators for the ACE Program were established in an ACE Program logic model. Data on performance indicators were collected through the ACE-IS biannually. Data assessed Centers' ability to develop, implement, and evaluate YV prevention activities. Performance indicator data demonstrate substantial progress on Centers' research in YV risk and protective factors, community partnerships, and other accomplishments. Findings provide important lessons learned, illustrate progress made by the Centers, and point to new directions for YV prevention research and programmatic efforts.

The political influence of the situation can have major effects on the evaluation design, approach and methods. Politics also has the potential to influence the decisions made from the evaluation findings. The current study focuses on the influence of the political context on stakeholder decision making. Utilizing a simulation scenario, this study compares stakeholder decision making in high and low stakes evaluation contexts. Findings suggest that high stakes political environments are more likely than low stakes environments to lead to reduced reliance on technically appropriate measures and increased dependence on measures better reflect the broader political environment.

Additionally, while studies have generally focused on barriers to shelter use, studies on what might facilitate shelter use are lacking. This study explores barriers and facilitators to shelter use among homeless young adults from a large city in the Southwest region. Focus groups were conducted with a diverse sample of 49 homeless young adults ages 18-24. Drawing on models of health service use, findings were categorized into two domains - attitudinal and access. Themes related to attitudinal barriers include stigma/shame and self-reliance/pride. Attitudinal facilitators include the desire to extricate themselves from street life and turn their lives in a new direction. Access-related themes include barriers such as a lack of shelters and services available to meet the needs of youth, adverse shelter conditions, staff attitudes that are not acceptable to youth, restrictive shelter rules, restrictive definitions of homelessness, and a desire to differentiate themselves from older homeless individuals. Certain characteristics or circumstances (e.g., being pregnant), having supportive others, and shelters' ability to connect them to other services emerged as access facilitators to shelter use. Implications for policymakers, service providers, and future research are discussed.

Infrastructure projects in developed countries are rarely evaluated ex-post. Despite their number and scope, our knowledge about their various impacts is surprisingly limited. The paper argues that such projects must be assessed in a broad perspective that includes both operational, tactical and strategic aspects, and unintended as well as intended effects. A generic six-criteria evaluation framework is suggested, inspired by a framework frequently used to evaluate development assistance projects. It is tested on 20 Norwegian projects from various sectors (transport, defence, ICT, buildings). The results indicate that the majority of projects were successful, especially in operational terms, possibly because they underwent external quality assurance up-front. It is argued that applying this type of standardized framework provides a good basis for comparison and learning across sectors. It is suggested that evaluations should be conducted with the aim of promoting accountability, building knowledge about infrastructure projects, and continuously improve the tools, methods and governance arrangements used in the front-end of project development.

In order to be re-elected or to achieve desirable policies, parliamentarians can either appeal to their constituency or to their party by adopting legislative roles. The study is based on twelve case studies of parliamentary requests from the Swiss parliament between 2010 and 2014. The analysis shows that parliamentarians of legislative committees submit parliamentary requests to oppose a policy, while parliamentarians of oversight committees submit parliamentary requests to obtain information on specific policies. On the contrary, the party membership of the responsible Federal Councillor does not influence the strategy. These findings suggest that parliamentarians use evaluations as an instrument rather than using the actual findings. This conclusion might be very relevant to understand how evaluations are used in the political process.

Results show that those newspaper articles containing evaluations exhibit higher levels of justification, reciprocity and respect, tend to argue in terms of the common good, and contain less storytelling than newspaper articles that do not refer to evaluations.

Results showed that evaluation use facilitated formal and informal changes at the individual and the organizational level; and, this pattern occurred in a predominantly non-linear fashion, interconnected and overlapping, while gradually decreasing in time and space. Evaluation use was mostly unpredictable, which reflected how meanings are constructed by staff members, as they adjusted and interpreted the findings in opportunistic ways.

Among various factors, we investigate the individual time preferences of Russians. To estimate individual time preferences, we use an experiment in which survey respondents are given hypothetical money prizes. We find that being middle-aged, being unmarried and having parents who smoke are positively correlated with both men and women's likelihood of taking up smoking in Russia. We consider the possible endogeneity of an individual's health status and find a positive relationship between smoking and the time preferences of Russians. Our findings confirm that decisionmakers should devote their efforts primarily to developing restrictive anti-smoking policy. The choice of policy measures should be guided by the individual characteristics of target population groups. Social advertising, public lectures and preventive care should be actively engaged in forming public attitudes towards smoking. Smoking; Program planning; Policy measures; Socioeconomic factors; Rate of time arguments in direct democracy: The case of smoking bans in Switzerland This article analyses the use of evidence, such as policy evaluation studies, in arguments in direct-democratic campaigns. Set in the context of 16 Swiss direct-democratic campaigns on smoking bans, the article compares evidence-based arguments with arguments that do not refer to evidence. The study adds to the argumentative direction in evaluation and program planning by showing that in direct-democratic campaigns, the political use of evaluation results to substantiate policy preferences is rare. The study shows that around 6% of the arguments refer to evidence and that evaluation results are mostly cited in support of causal arguments referring to the effects of policy interventions. Above all, the results show that policy information is available, at least for causal arguments, and apparently known in the public discourse but only cited explicitly when the speaker wants to raise credibility. This applies especially to researchers, such as evaluators. The results further indicate that the political use of evaluation results fosters an informed discourse and the evidence may eventually become common public knowledge. The credentials of evaluators make them suitable not only for bringing more evaluation results into the direct-democratic discourse but also for acting as teachers in this discourse.

UWALK incorporated various communication and marketing strategies via mass media, on- and off-line platforms. Participants (N = 127) reported unprompted then prompted awareness of UWALK followed by measures of attentional bias and implicit attitudes, watched a 30-second UWALK video, then completed a thought listing task and questionnaires measuring instrumental and affective attitudes, leisure time physical activity, and demographics. Results showed that participants with unprompted awareness of UWALK demonstrated attentional bias toward UWALK images, positive implicit attitudes, and greater physical activity participation compared to unaware counterparts. Attentional bias, awareness, and implicit attitudes significantly predicted behavior, accounting for 15.2% of the variance.

The results of the Complex Adaptive Systems as a Model for Network Evaluations (CASNET) project indicate that complex adaptive system concepts help to explain evaluation capacity building in a network. The NISE Network was found to be a complex learning system that was supportive of evaluation capacity building through feedback loops that provided for information sharing and interaction. Participants in the system had different levels of and sources of evaluation knowledge. To be successful at building capacity, the system needed to have a balance between both centralized and decentralized control, coherence, redundancy, and diversity. Embeddedness of individuals within the system also provided support and moved the capacity of the system forward. Finally, success depended on attention being paid to the control of resources.

This theoretically grounded study tested the effectiveness of a recruitment strategy - a simulated parent-led support group (PSG) - to increase intentions to attend a PSG in a predominantly low income, minority sample. The study also examined sociodemographic characteristics that may influence the effectiveness of the recruitment strategy and engagement in PSGs. Surveys assessing intentions to attend a PSG were administered before and after the simulation, and a 2-month follow-up survey assessed subsequent PSG attendance. A total of 95 participants were included in this study. Results indicate that participants' intentions to attend a PSG significantly increased following the PSG simulation (Cohen's d = 1.15), especially among Hispanics. However, PSG attendance in the 2 months following the PSG simulation was relatively low, with only 13% of parents attending a PSG or a planning meeting to start a new PSG. Nevertheless, this recruitment strategy may serve as an important component of a larger engagement effort, especially given the substantial challenges of engaging vulnerable populations in PSGs and other parenting interventions to reduce educational and health disparities.

This study set out to examine this evaluative culture in one of the world's largest non-formal educational organizations through the use of an online survey and quantitative methodology. A path model was developed to examine the factors affecting evaluation culture. Results show perception regarding evaluation, program area, college major, location, training in evaluation, degree level, and years of experience explained 28% of the variance within evaluation culture.

Studies show that evaluators are repeatedly put under pressure to deliver results in line with given expectations. The study of pressure and influence to misrepresent findings is hence an important research strand for the development of evaluation praxis. A conceptual challenge in the area of evaluation ethics research is the fact that pressure can be not only negative, but also positive. We develop a heuristic model of influence on evaluations that does justice to this ambivalence of influence: the BUSD-model (betterment, undermining, support, distortion). The model is based on the distinction of two dimensions, namely 'explicitness of pressure' and 'direction of influence'. We demonstrate how the model can be applied to understand pressure and offer a practical tool to distinguish positive from negative influence in the form of three so-called differentiators (awareness, accordance, intention). The differentiators comprise a practical component by assisting evaluators who are with influence.

However, the evaluative scholarship of such programs overwhelmingly reflects studies in developed countries while barely showcasing the realities of addressing domestic violence in developing countries. This paper features a multi-year (2008-2011) evaluation study that measured the fidelity of the United Nations Partnership for Peace (PfP) domestic violence diversion program in the Eastern Caribbean country of Grenada. Our findings illuminate organic engagement strategies that were built within existing multi-sectoral partnerships that included magistrate court judges, law enforcement officials, and social service agencies. Furthermore, we documented how the locally-devised implementation strategies ensured the program's fidelity within a resource-limited context. This paper contributes to the global evaluative scholarship, highlighting the lessons learned about implementing culturally-adapted and theoretically-driven domestic violence diversion within a developing country.

In Indian context, all these goals are very relevant and critical, as India missed the target on many components of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The author strongly feels that one of the key reasons was lack of an in-built robust system for measuring the progress and achievements of MDGs. Monitoring and Evaluation of programmes and schemes, aiming at different SDGs, in a robust and regular manner is therefore need of the hour. A National evaluation policy (NEP) would set the tone in the right direction from the very beginning for achieving SDGs.

Using a community-based participatory research model (CBPR) we developed a collaboration between our university and a small Pacific Island nation. We established an advisory council of local stakeholders and then conducted an extensive needs assessment with youth, parents, professionals, and lay public. Only 9% of participants had tried a weight loss program. There was a strong tendency to engage in binge-eating cycles; difficulty eating healthy during frequent community celebrations with few healthy food options available in general; and limited traditions that involved physical activity. Participants wanted to learn how to increase their physical activity, make healthier food choices, and learn to reward themselves for healthy behaviors. Diets were most frequently high in energy or protein foods, followed by starch, sugary and fried foods; they ate vegetables and fruits least often. Together, our team then created the culturally relevant Fit Kit Palau\u00a9. We highlight lessons learned including how to determine partnerships; manage multiple cultural and geographic barriers; build capacity; and balance program fidelity with responsivity. As the program moves forward, we hope to increase access, engagement, and adherence and provide a model for other PI countries.

We applied a youth participatory research and evaluation approach (PRE) to inform research and evaluation on the impact of a Chagas disease control program in southern Ecuador. Our main interest was to examine the methodological contributions of PRE to knowledge sharing for health intervention planning in the context of global health and neglected tropical diseases. The results of this study suggest that by demystifying research and evaluation practices and rendering them accessible and relevant, marginalized youth can develop critical and reflexive thinking skills that could be useful for decision-making on health promotion. Our findings also reveal the potential of youth as active participants in project development in ways that enhance, validate, and improve health interventions. Young people are interested in learning about and sharing local knowledge that can benefit research and evaluation processes. Despite the numerous strengths demonstrated by PRE, the inherent complexities of international development, such as cultural differences, asymmetrical power relations, and the ongoing challenges of sustainability, remain.

There is limited research on factors that predict placement in permanent housing following prevention and rapid rehousing interventions, particularly for single adult populations. The present study examined demographic and program-related predictors of permanent housing upon program exit among two groups of adults enrolled in HPRP in Indianapolis, IN: Homelessness Prevention (HP) recipients (n = 219) and Rapid Re-housing (RRH) recipients (n = 296). Results revealed that 76.3% of HP and 68.8% of RRH recipients were living in permanent housing when they exited HPRP. For HP recipients, completion of HPRP and outreach and engagement services were significant predictors of remaining in permanent housing. For RRH recipients, individuals who were African American, did not have a disabling condition, completed HPRP, received a greater amount of financial assistance, and received case management services had significantly greater odds of permanent housing. Findings have implications for informing short-term housing support programs for precariously housed or homeless single adults and highlight the need for future research on prevention and rehousing interventions.

However, it is also argued that the function of evaluations in an inherently political context such as parliament is to provide arguments and justifications rather than simply supply information for policymaking. This paper provides a fine-grained account of the use of evaluations by members of parliament in the context of political conflict. Previous research has highlighted the importance of this factor, but the findings are controversial. Here, four case studies of policy processes in two Swiss cantonal parliaments illustrate that political conflict is highly context-specific. Documentary analysis and interviews show that the members of parliament used evaluations to inform themselves as well as to gain political support in the moderately contested case. This both supports and challenges previous research. Comparing the cases reveals that the administration's use of evaluations strongly influences their use in the non-professional cantonal parliaments. However, Switzerland's semi-direct democracy and its conflict-resolving mechanisms shape and limit this role, particularly if political conflict is high.

This study examined, through semi-structured interviews, how a rare group of nine rubric-using seasoned evaluators from across the globe use and learned to use rubrics in their program evaluation practice. Key findings revealed rubrics were a critical component to the practice of these evaluators to make determinations, but also as frameworks to sharpen an evaluation's focus. Additionally, findings support the notion that there is a paucity of formal channels for learning about rubrics and indicate these early adopters are instead, honing their skills through informal channels such as trial and error and by tapping into a community of practice. Future directions for training and research should include expanding understanding, application, and acceptance of use.

When fear is pervasive, it constrains people's ability and willingness to participate in an evaluation and their candor if they do. It can also be dangerous. Safety and well-being of participants and researchers in his view take priority over the evaluation's goals. Evaluation involving people who are survivors of violence, torture and conflict requires special sensitivity and examples are offered of appropriate methodologies. Stakeholders in evaluations presumably have beneficent interest in a program's success. However in conflict situations 'malevolent' stakeholders, who standing to gain from a project's failure, will actively try to thwart it. Undermining the evaluation as well and impugning the evaluator's objectivity, skill, knowledge and credibility are among the tactics they employ. Evaluators are urged to stay attuned to field conditions, consider alternative methods and locations for collecting data and be self-conscious and deliberate about how their study and role are defined and understood by contending parties.

This study examines the extent to which external and internal organizational pressures contributed to the degree of adoption of culturally and linguistically responsive practices in the nation's outpatient substance abuse treatment system early in the period of development of this system of care. Findings show that a higher degree of adoption of culturally competent practices was most likely in treatment programs with high dependence on external funding and regulation. Internally, programs with a larger number of professionals were associated with the lowest degree of adoption, while managers' cultural sensitivity contributed significantly to a high degree of adoption of these responsive practices. Considering the passage of recent legislation enforcing the use of cultural and linguistic competence in health care, implications of these baseline findings on early adoption patterns are discussed for future research and health care policy evaluation.

To enhance awareness of this diversity among patients and to provide holistic care for them, health professionals should first be aware of the relation between dimensions of diversity and patients' health and health demands. This paper presents a formative process evaluation of a diversity sensitivity training programme for healthcare professionals. The training was implemented in three healthcare settings (mental healthcare, nursing home and hospital care). Mixed methods were used to monitor the implementation of the training and its effects after three years. Findings demonstrate that the training stimulated participants' awareness, knowledge and critical attitudes towards diversity. Their motivation and willingness to take action regarding diversity was also enhanced. Yet these developments were less apparent among nursing home participants who felt less satisfied and did not develop a critical perspective on this issue. Qualitative data were helpful to explain differences between the settings. By means of the combination of quantitative and qualitative data, we can conclude that individual learning was not enough to guarantee a sensitive approach to diversity at the organizational level.

We examined the propensity for PPE of health professionals by focusing on four components: learning, working in groups, using judgment and using systematic methods. We interviewed the professionals at a Haitian health institution to determine their positioning on a scale of propensity (low, medium and high) for the four components. The professionals defined each component in relation to the energy puts into them, being more or less proactive. Facilitating elements for all three levels of propensity integration included past positive experiences, external pressure and a desire for better individual and organizational performance. Impeding factors included a lack of available resources perceived responsibilities and commitments toward private patients. The reported advantages included improved organizational performance and idea sharing, and the disadvantages included availability of, difficulty implementing solutions and altered human relationships.

Critical to the success of outcome monitoring was the ability of CBOs to recruit and retain clients in evaluation studies. Two EBIs, Video Opportunities for Innovative Condom Education and Safer Sex (VOICES/VOCES) and Healthy Relationships, were evaluated using repeated measure studies, which require robust follow-up retention rates to increase the validity and usefulness of the findings. The retention rates were high for both VOICES/VOCES CBOs (95.8% at 30 days and 91.1% at 120 days), and Healthy Relationships CBOs (89.5% at 90 days and 83.5% at 180 days). This paper presents an overview of the retention of clients, challenges to follow-up, and strategies developed by CBOs to achieve high retention rates. These strategies and rates are discussed within the context of the CBOs' target populations and communities.

A State-led intervention (2004-2005) and two action research projects (2007-2010) were implemented in a health district in Burkina Faso to exempt the indigent from user fees. This article presents the results of the process evaluation of these three interventions. Individual and group interviews were organized with the key stakeholders (health staff, community members) to document the strengths and weaknesses of key components of the interventions (relevance and uptake of the intervention, worst-off selection and information, financial arrangements). Data was subjected to content analysis and thematic analysis. The results show that all three intervention processes can be improved. Community-based targeting was better accepted by the stakeholders than was the State-led intervention. The strengths of the community-based approach were in clearly defining the selection criteria, informing the waiver beneficiaries, using a participative process and using endogenous funding. A weakness was that using endogenous funding led to restrictive selection by the community. The community-based approach appears to be the most effective, but it needs to be improved and retested to generate more knowledge before scaling up.

Each site is required to forge partnerships with representatives from education, mental health, juvenile justice, and law enforcement, coordinating and integrating their efforts and working together to contribute to comparable outcomes (e.g., reduced violence and alcohol and drug use, improved mental health services). The evaluation uses multiple data collection techniques (archival data, surveys, site visits, interviews, and focus groups) from a variety of sources (project directors, community partners, schools, and students) over several years. Certain characteristics of the SS/HS initiative represent unique challenges for the evaluation, including the absence of common metrics for baseline, outcome data, and lack of comparison group. A unifying program theory was required to address these challenges and synthesize the large amounts of qualitative and quantitative information collected.

CAFAS scores were measured every 90 days, providing multiple CAFAS scores for each individual. Results demonstrated that on average residents improved in functioning over time. Sensitive to the evolving needs of residents who had been entering the program, the treatment center made significant program changes in 2006 to attempt to better serve residents through a broad array of specialized programming. Compared to the overall results, the analysis suggested that residents who entered the program since October 2006 appeared to have made larger improvements in their CAFAS scores. Results were derived by employing multilevel models appropriate for estimating growth trajectories with repeated measures data.

To better understand which factors influence engagement, this study examines several predictors of couple engagement in Family Foundations (FF), a preventive intervention for first-time parents shown to enhance parent mental health, couple relations, parenting quality, and child adjustment through age 3 years. FF consists of a series of classes delivered through childbirth education departments at local hospitals. Baseline data on socio-demographics, parent mental health, and couple relationship quality were examined as predictors of participants' level of engagement in FF (n=89 couples, 178 individuals). Sociodemographic variables such as parent gender, socioeconomic status, and age predicted program engagement to a limited extent. However, findings indicated that marital status was the best predictor of engagement. Discussion focuses on how findings can inform the development of practices that promote engagement, such as the use of targeted outreach efforts for individuals most at risk of disengagement.

The program, run by the Multiple Sclerosis Society of WA (Inc.) provides in-home care and supports and respite for people who are under the age of sixty-five and diagnosed with a rapidly degenerative neurological condition. In 2009, the identified barriers to the better provision of services included: shortage of quality out-of-home respite providers, and convoluted paperwork requirements to qualify for the program. Some service providers were unaware of the program and so were not referring them into the NCCCP, a number of service providers were unwilling to refer their clients into the program, neurologists were unwilling to give a final diagnosis for a client, that would enable them to qualify for the service, there was a general lack of knowledge about what services were available in the general community, and existing equipment pools were under-resourced. In 2010, the study found that most of the issues had been addressed however, out-of-home respite services were still very limited especially in rural areas, and the eligibility criteria for entry to the program is confined to those 65 years and under. This paper discusses the issues that still remain with the program as examples of barriers to better provision of services.

This article reports on the Evaluability Assessment (EA) study that aimed to orient decisions for its evaluation in close relationship with the information needs of the stakeholders. Various methods were used, including document reviews, individual interviews, focus group discussions, meetings, literature reviews and site visits. A description of the intervention theory and philosophy is provided with its logic models and its reality documented. Lessons on the procedure include the importance of the position of the evaluability assessor, the value of replicating some steps of the assessment and the relationships between EA and process evaluation. The evaluability study concludes that the intervention had some evaluable components. To satisfy the stakeholders' needs, the initially planned community randomized controlled trial can be maintained and complemented with a process evaluation. There is a need to provide sufficient information on the cost of the intervention. This will inform decision makers on the possibility of replicating the intervention in other contexts.

The concern of the public health sector has lead to the development of public health campaigns, focusing on two-fold goals: to inform the public as to the health risks inherent in being overweight, and the benefits of a change in nutritional behaviour. Recent studies indicate that the effects of the average public health campaign on the target community is around 5%.

Most of the time, right-wing extremism remains latent. However, as soon as a constituency is confronted with manifest right-wing incidents (right-wing extremist group meetings, racist assaults or violence against individuals and groups), the issue reappears in the political sphere. The countermeasures available to governments frequently remain unclear: empirically based evidence on the effectiveness of specific measures is often simply lacking. In this article we argue that this inadequacy is mostly due to the specific characteristics of the particular conditions of conflict and violence that are associated with the phenomenon of 'right-wing extremism'. These conditions include an often only insufficiently clarified understanding of the phenomenon of 'right-wing extremism' as well as a highly sensitive political, social and legal context for countermeasures. Furthermore, the effectiveness of countermeasures is typically strongly dependent on the actors involved as well as their actions and interactions. Implementation is therefore often unique and, as a consequence, difficult to replicate. We will address these specific challenges for evaluation under such conditions in seven case studies. Each case study includes an evaluation of a measure that has been taken against phenomena of right-wing extremism in Switzerland on the federal, state or community level. The case studies show that certain challenges for evaluation can be met by adopting an adequate evaluation design. Other aspects require further investigation and may not be adequately addressed through the evaluation of countermeasures.

This paper first seeks to identify what is currently known about internal evaluation through a synthesis of the literature in this area. It then presents a case narrative illustrating how internal and external evaluation approaches may be used together to strengthen an evaluation project and to develop the evaluation capacity of the organization. Lessons learned include the need to integrate internal and external resources throughout the evaluation and to clarify expectations at the outset of the project.

The SS/HS national evaluation team developed a survey to collect partners' perceptions of functioning within SS/HS partnerships. Average partnership functioning scores were used to rank each site from lowest to highest. Sites with the most favorable perceptions of partnership functioning were defined as having average scores in the top 10% (n=10) and sites with the least favorable perceptions of partnership functioning were defined as having average scores in the bottom 10% (n=10). Qualitative data for these 20 sites were inductively open coded for emergent themes and analyzed for patterns using grounded theory approach. Six themes emerged that distinguished sites reporting the most favorable and least favorable perceptions of partnership functioning: partner engagement, facilitators, barriers, shared decision making, partnership structure, and sustainability. Sites reporting the most favorable perceptions of partnership functioning effectively utilized collaboration processes that facilitate coalition building, such as shared decision making, effective communication, and developing a clearly defined structure. Qualitative themes from this analysis provide evidence of validity for the partnership functioning scale used and illustrate distinguishing features between sites with the most favorable and least favorable perceptions of partnership functioning.

External evaluators control most of the process while stakeholders are the most consulted but are rarely participants. Yet, we believe that not all evaluators are comfortable with that sort of practice and that it is possible to involve stakeholders in the evaluation process in the field. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate, that even in a post-conflict setting such as Afghanistan in 2003, a short term consultancy allowed for the adoption of a collaborative and useful evaluation approach. After the description of the whole process in order to facilitate its reproduction by humanitarian evaluators, we discuss strengths and weaknesses of the process and highlight some positives and negatives factors affecting the use of evaluation finding. Afghanistan; Participative evaluation; Consultancy; A government perspective Government authorities are seeking new, cost-effective ways to stimulate growth and job creation by increasingly favoring the development of innovation ecosystems. Corporate-startup collaboration as a phenomenon has therefore progressively been supported by government authorities as a way of simultaneously helping startups to scale and providing opportunities for incumbents to renew themselves. However, evaluating the results of such collaborations is complex, which means that it can be a challenge for any government agency to evaluate its related interventions. This paper is explorative and based on empirical data from a study of the Swedish innovation agency, Vinnova. The purpose is to improve our understanding on how governments today evaluate government funded corporate-startup collaboration initiatives and how evaluations can be improved by utilizing methods based on theory-driven and realist approaches. An evaluation framework for policy makers based on a theory-driven and learning cycle approach is presented in this paper.

Nevertheless, market demand for these banquets has lately fallen drastically, causing a severe impact on the industry. In this study, the critical factors influencing the choice to conduct roadside wedding banquets were investigated from the consumer's standpoint. Initially, on the basis of expert screening and literature study, 14 criteria covering five dimensions were developed. Subsequently, causal connections and impact weights were determined using the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and DANP (DEMATEL-based analytic network process) models. The findings indicate that customers prioritise service quality in improvement initiatives. Dish quality, hygiene, and marketing are the most appreciated dimensions. Overall, customers place the highest significance on pricing. The industry is recommended to create online marketing platforms, raise the standard of wedding banquet services, combine the value chains of wedding services, and support the sustainable growth of the industry. The method used enriches existing theoretical approaches concerning roadside wedding banquets and is applicable in assisting wedding banquet providers' management in holding roadside weddings.

However, logistical challenges with traditional in-person conferences can detract from the reach of educator PD (Corcoran, 1995; Johnston, 1994; Shaffer & McNinch, 1997; Stephens, 1991). Project ECHO is a model of PD that utilizes videoconferencing technology to provide training to educators in rural or underserved areas through didactic presentations and case-based learning (Arora et al., 2007; Root-Elledge et al., 2018) while eliminating some of the challenges faced by traditional conferences. However, cost comparisons between ECHO and various forms of PD have not previously been considered. The current study utilizes an in-depth cost comparison to examine PD delivered by ECHO relative to traditional conferences. Findings suggest that ECHO is more affordable for funders and attendees overall. ECHO for Education may, therefore, be a useful tool in delivering PD to educators in rural and remote communities.

This article describes a retrospective, summative evaluation to determine the extent to which LLS has met its short-term goals for PHL workforce development. The evaluation relied on existing data from routine LLS data collection and reporting, supplemented with a new alumni survey. The purpose of the design was threefold: 1) to reduce data collection burden on program staff and participants, 2) to assess the value and limits of routine fellowship data for comprehensive public health workforce development program evaluation, and 3) to identify ways to improve LLS's routine data collections for program evaluation. We used descriptive statistics, qualitative analysis, and participatory methods (i.e., a data party) to analyze and interpret data. Results show LLS short-term outcome achievement and highlight opportunities for program improvement, particularly related to the design of certain training requirements and for future evaluations. Overall, the evaluation contributes to lessons learned for PHL workforce development efforts, including how routine data collections can contribute to comprehensive public health workforce development evaluations.

Researchers establish that the current challenges of human resources management to attract and retain talent are based on fostering and increasing the participation of relationships with employees and sustainably managing the organization and teams. The objective of this article is to evaluate the effect that sustainable human resource management has on social capital, and employee retention and loyalty programs. The information required to carry out the empirical analysis was obtained from an online survey to Spanish universities. Data processing was conducted by using the PLS-SEM technique. The results obtained show that social sustainability actions influence the social capital perceived by employees significantly and that social capital influences their loyalty and retention significantly. However, we found that social sustainability actions influence employee loyalty and retention significantly and positively only when it mediates between social capital. This research contributes to the management of organizations and suggests human capital managers to have a greater relational management of human resources in the connection, involvement and transparency of their social sustainability actions in order to achieve greater loyalty and retention ratios, better performance of the organization and, in general, a greater benefit for society.

In this study, we report on findings from four years of data collected from the Community Research Scholars Initiative (CRSI) in Cleveland, Ohio. CRSI provided intensive research training over two years to two cohorts (N = 9) of frontline workers (\"Scholars\") from CBOs focused on health disparities. Scholars completed one year of didactic training and one year of mentoring to complete a research project based at their organization. Findings from surveys, focus groups with Scholars, and supervisor interviews indicated changes in Scholars' knowledge, confidence, and comfort with research concepts and skills. Scholars also demonstrated greater confidence in interacting with academic researchers, enhanced networks and career opportunities, and increased capacity for conducting community-based research. Scholar and organization engagement with community-based research was maintained after the program's end through a community-based research network (CBRN). Findings suggest that the intensive training program for community members with a broad curriculum, mentoring, and strong support helped changed how CBOs think about data and research and demonstrate the impact of their work.

This evaluation assessed the effect of The Positive Life Workshop (TPLW)\u2014a 7-session peer-led HIV self-management program\u2014on psychosocial and HIV treatment outcomes. The overall sample included 1360 PWH who completed TPLW during 3/2015-2/2019. Surveys were administered before and after the program, and three months following program completion. Analyses examined changes in outcomes from pre-test to both post-test and 3-month follow-up using non-parametric tests. Subgroup analyses were conducted for 406 participants with 1 characteristic of the priority population for TPLW (i.e., recent HIV diagnosis, not taking antiretroviral therapy (ART), suboptimal ART adherence, unsuppressed viral load). In the overall sample, there were statistically significant improvements in HIV-related knowledge, social support, patient self-advocacy, and confidence in self-management between pre-test and post-test/3-month follow-up assessment. Analyses for the priority population showed significant increases from pre-test to 3-month follow-up in the proportion of participants who were 90 % adherent to ART (59-83 %, p < 0.01) and virally suppressed (42 % to 66 %, p < 0.01). The findings suggest the importance of ensuring HIV self-management interventions reach vulnerable populations of PWH who struggle with initiating and maintaining HIV-related health-promoting behaviors.

Frameworks that assume stability and predictability may not match the system dynamics within which a program resides. This paper seeks to further evaluators' understanding of how to improve problems in complex systems by offering a \"problem-bound\" evaluation approach. This model is grounded in theoretical concepts from complexity science, complex adaptive systems, systems thinking, and improvement science. As such, it provides an agile and flexible framework for continually learning from emergent findings related to the problem. By offering this model, we seek to contribute to the limited knowledge base on how to apply systems change theoretical ideas in evaluation practice, along with practical implications regarding the evaluator's role.

Strategic planning is the process of setting long-term goals, prioritizing actions to achieve the goals, and mobilizing human and financial resources to execute the actions. Although there has been considerable debate about the appropriate scope, content, and procedures for strategic planning in local government, less attention has been paid to the quality of municipal strategic plans, meaning the presence or absence of key characteristics that analysts typically associate with good plans. This article explores the content and quality of municipal strategic plans in Canada. It presents results of a comparative plan quality evaluation, which assessed the official strategic plans of the 66 most populous Canadian municipalities using a comprehensive set of criteria derived from existing scholarship on plan quality and strategic planning. The findings indicate that there is considerable room to improve municipal strategic plans, which lack many of the features commonly associated with good quality plans. Municipal strategic plans should contain a comprehensive fact base to prioritize and rationalize the goals within the plan, and there should be appropriate provisions for implementing, monitoring, and evaluating plan progress and outcomes.

The study aims also to determine whether LPint reduces domestic violence due to mediating effects of reduction of psychopathology, improved positive masculinity attitudes, family and social life and psychological states. This study uses a Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial design, with person-level and cluster-level outcomes. The counterfactual is villages that are listed as being affected by the conflict in North and South Kivu of Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Sixty villages with 1736 participants were included in the study. The primary analysis will use generalized estimating equations to compare treatments versus control groups on their mean change in domestic violence between baseline and endline one and two. The allocated group will be regarded as fixed effects whilst villages and time points are regarded as random effects in the model. This is a unique study in the context of a protracted violent humanitarian crisis notably the DRC. It uses a Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial (CRCT) to obtain hard empirical evidence to prove the scalability of the Living Peace intervention in close humanitarian contexts. Positive masculinity; Domestic is the societal impact of university research? A policy-oriented review to map approaches, identify monitoring methods and success factors The discussion on the 'societal impact of university research' has emerged within the recent decade with different utilisation from the British REF impact stories to the EU Framework Programmes' criteria. The fundamental idea is that (university) research should contribute to addressing societal challenges, such as climate change, and not just pursue 'scientific excellence'. Several approaches have been developed, from case studies of the 'productive interactions' that co-create knowledge with societal stakeholders to the so-called 'altmetrics' tracking online dissemination of research outputs. Nonetheless, these experiences do not always point in the same direction, and the notion of 'societal impact' seems still unclearly defined. Given the growing policy pressure on universities to address societal challenges, this paper reviews the scientific literature on the so-called 'societal impact' of university research. By querying three scientific archives (Web of Science, Scopus and ScienceDirect), 135 relevant scientific publications are selected and discussed, looking for conceptualisations, monitoring methods and success factors. The review maps a value-laden discussion arguing for longer-term, multi-dimensional perspectives on university research impacts beyond bibliometric indicators. Findings highlight a progressive shift from 'attribution', i.e., looking for causal relationships between research and societal changes, to 'contribution', acknowledging researchers' efforts to engage with societal challenges. Societal impact; Research study of a long-standing research-practice partnership Research-practice partnerships (RPP) provide opportunities to connect researchers, practitioners, and/or community development professionals in meaningful ways, thereby improving the quality of research, evaluation, and practice in communities. Yet, there is still much to learn about how successful partnerships between researchers and practitioners develop. Historically, research on this topic has emphasized challenges that prevent RPP from developing to their highest potential, with limited information available on ways to promote RPP and how to ensure RPP are mutually beneficial for participants. However, research on partnerships more generally, such as multisector partnerships, can contribute meaningfully to the RPP field. We present an in-depth case study on a successful, long-term partnership. In this study, we pull from the broader partnership literature to explore contexts that are likely to promote partnerships, as well as the activities that can strengthen RPP. Findings focus on addressing ways to promote RPP and highlight the importance of preexisting factors, such as a culture that values both researcher and practitioner expertise, history, and chemistry between partners. Additionally, non-professional space and time, productive disagreements, clear but evolving roles, and shared power were found to strengthen collaboration within the partnership. Specific advice for anyone considering joining an RPP is also discussed. Research-practice Agans, Jennifer P. Lawhon, Ben Mateer, Timothy J. Freeman, Stephanie Taff, B.

Despite their accomplishments and strengths, women SSM/Vs can be challenged by their military and gender identities in a university environment surrounded by peers who differ in age and life experience (Iverson et al., 2016). Guided by King's (2004) meaning of life meta-model, the Fellowship was designed to increase sense of belonging, understanding of self, and engagement in behaviors tied to academic and career success. We gathered longitudinal evaluation data from two early program cohorts comprising 19 women. Analyses indicated that women reported significant gains in knowledge and use of personal strengths, identity integration, resume preparation, and networking skills, with baseline assessments controlled. No gains were found for sense of belonging or engagement in networking with career professionals or military peers. Based on existing literature, improvement in identity integration is a particularly positive contribution to women students' academic and career success.

HDC is a tool for data collection and a reference for pluralist-constructivist thinking, considered a form of fourth-generation evaluation. Hofstede's cultural dimensions were also integrated into the investigation in order to facilitate mediation in an evaluative context. Students' performances (N = 25) from a S\u00e3o Paulo-Brazil public school were statistically evaluated. Their cultural profile was determined via the Hofstede Value Survey Model 1994 questionnaire. The elaborative process of arranging concept maps was individual (CM-individual) and integrated with HDC in groups (CM-HDC). Concept map assessment methods were based off existing literature. An improvement in students' performances (p < 0.05) that presented concept maps integrated to HDC in a more complex structure when compared to individually-built maps was observed. Employment of HDC helped form motivational/interactive dialogues between students and teachers, which, in turn, assisted in achieving greater learning through the use of concept maps. The application of the fourth-generation evaluation was improved via knowledge regarding students' cultural profiles.

Our study first sought to analyze service statistics of Primary Health Care (PHC) facilities for the years 2017 and 2018 to develop PHC key performance indicators (KPI).This was then followed by a thorough discussion of these KPIs with staff and service providers. Finally, re-rating these PHC (KPI) changes by analyzing service statistics infographs for 2017 and 2018 relative to 2019. El-Aiat Health District-Giza Governorate and its 15 PHC facilities served as the study's setting. A quasi-experimental intervention design was used based on operation research with quantitative and qualitative data analysis. The pre-test consisted of a mathematical analysis of service and vital statistics for 2017 and 2018 to calculate composite indices and create infographs (simple colored matrices) for these indices. The intervention included two discussion meetings (2 h each). It included reviewing the Performance Knowledge Matrices (infographs) with the service providers for subsequent problem specification, solving, and suggestion extraction to enhance performance. The SWOC (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Challenges) framework was used to analyze the qualitative data extracted from these conversations. Among the identified flaws were a deficiency in the number of physicians and nurses, inadequate training, insufficient work environments, and a lack of moral appreciation and recognition for the staff. The proposed solutions include providing health education services by nurses and follow-up services in certain units via home visits and mobile clinics. Post-test also entailed analyzing service and vital statistics for 2019 and redisplaying KPI infographics. Four of fifteen PHC facilities achieved a positive response based on the staff-suggested info-action-based intervention, according to our findings after comparing data for the pre-intervention and post-intervention periods of 2017-2018 and 2019. We concluded that reviewing the information derived from the \"knowledge performance colored matrix\" inspired district and PHC service providers to identify their weaknesses (avoided them as much as possible) and their strengths (practiced the solutions they suggested themselves) in the meetings which eventually improved their performance. Ultimately, the outcome scores and impact indicators of the provided PHC services were enhanced.

Pastors in each church completed a church organizational capacity assessment. The study team, including community partners representing church leadership, co-created a channel and content to disseminate the capacity data back to Project HEAL church leaders. This consisted of a 4-page lay report that included the church's capacity scores, and recommendations for future evidence-based health promotion programming matched to their capacity. The study team was able to meet with nine of the 14 churches to review the report, which took an average of six and a half weeks to schedule. The individualized church reports were well-received by pastors, who expressed an intention to share the information with others in the church and to sustain health promotion activities in their organizations. Though the individualized reports were embraced by the pastors, it is unknown whether this process will result in sustainable health promotion in these organizations without further follow-up.

CBPR principles and evaluation frameworks highlight an emphasis on equitable group dynamics (e.g., shared leadership and power, participatory decision-making, two-way open communication) that promote both equitable processes within partnerships and health equity in the communities with whom they engage. The development of an evaluation framework that describes the manner in which equitable group dynamics promote intermediate and long-term equity outcomes can aid partners in assessing their ability to work together effectively and improve health equity in the broader community. CBPR principles align with health equity evaluation guidelines recently developed for Health Impact Assessments (HIAs), which emphasize meaningful engagement of communities in decision-making processes that influence their health. In this paper, we propose a synergistic framework integrating contributions from CBPR and HIA evaluation frameworks in order to guide efforts to evaluate partnership effectiveness in addressing health inequities. We suggest specific indicators that might be used to assess partnership effectiveness in addressing health equity and discuss implications for evaluation of partnership approaches to address health disparities; determinants of health; C 2018 70 25 34 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149718917303166 Ward, Melanie Schulz, Amy J.

The aim of this study was to collaborate with researchers who have not been involved directly in Family Wellbeing interventions to lead a review of characteristics of the Family Wellbeing intervention evaluation output to date, and to assess for evidence of the FWB intervention's impact on participants and their communities. The study found that where it is not appropriate or viable to conduct research, such as randomised control trials, alternative ways of providing evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of an intervention is vital. This review suggests that Family Wellbeing interventions are having a positive impact and promoting change in the lives of participants, their families and their communities. Hence, for complex interventions, such as those with Indigenous populations, evidence should demonstrate effectiveness against prescribed outcomes, as well as critical aspects behind how and why a complex intervention was successful.

However, school-based programmes often face implementation challenges, and the identification of factors influencing the implementation process is considered important in order to secure the effectiveness of future interventions. The aim of this study was to identify factors influencing the various implementation stages during the initial years of a programme tripling the amount of physical education at the primary school level. Document analysis of publicly available programme descriptions and meeting minutes, were conducted. Document analysis was complemented by two semi-structured group interviews with main programme managers to gather in-depth programme experiences and perspectives. Results show that early involvement of schools may ensure the best possible match between programmes and the needs and resources of schools, and that an ongoing shared partnership may help programme managers address program challenges in early stages. It seems that predetermined core elements in programmes are essential. At the same time programmes must be flexible enough for adaptation to individual school contexts. Finally, the implementation of triple the amount of physical education, is supported by teachers receiving a professional development course focusing on how to organise outdoor physical education in different seasons and weather conditions.

We specifically aim to contribute to a better understanding of how the combined effect of performance planning and performance evaluation fosters the well-being of police officers. In the slipstream of public sector reforms many public organizations adopted employee performance management. Although such system is found to increase performance, it might simultaneously elevate job demands, jeopardizing employees' well-being. Based on data gathered in one of the largest police departments of Belgium, structural equation modelling results demonstrate that the combination of performance planning and evaluation positively affects police officers' well-being. Satisfaction with the system was found to explain this relationship. The findings imply that police forces should ensure that performance evaluations are preceded and combined by performance planning in order to foster well-being.

We conducted a mixed-methods assessment of preliminary outcomes and implementation processes in three primary schools in Soweto, South Africa, from August to December 2013. Quantitative methods included participant attendance and SMS platform usage tracking, pre/post questionnaires, and structured observation. Qualitative data were collected from program participants, parents, teachers, and a social worker during 6 focus group discussions and 4 in-depth interviews. Of 394 participants enrolled, 97% (n = 382) graduated, and 217 unique users accessed the SMS platform. Questionnaires completed by 213 participants (mean age: 11.9, SD: 3.02 years) alongside qualitative findings showed modest improvements in participants' perceptions of power in relationships and gender equity, self-esteem, self-efficacy to avoid unwanted sex, communication with others about HIV and sex, and HIV-related knowledge and stigma. The coach-participant relationship, safe space, and integration of soccer were raised as key intervention components. Implementation challenges were faced around delivery of soccer-based activities. Findings highlight the relevance and importance of programs like SKILLZ Street in addressing challenges facing adolescent girls in South African townships.

However, empirical studies focusing on stakeholders' attitudes toward evaluation are scarce. The present paper explores the approach of assessing social representations as indicators of people's attitudes toward evaluation. In an exploratory study, two groups were surveyed: University students (n = 60) with rather theoretical knowledge of evaluation and stakeholders (n = 61) who had shortly before taken part in participatory evaluation studies. Both groups were asked to name their free associations with the term \"evaluation\", which were subsequently analyzed lexicographically. The results indicate different social representations of evaluation in the two groups. The student group primarily saw evaluation as an \"appraisal\", whereas the stakeholders emphasized the \"improvement\" resulting from evaluation. Implications for further evaluation research and practice are discussed. Attitudes; Stakeholders; Social representations; Free associations; pre-post designs: The need for mixed-method pilot data The retrospective pre-post design affords many benefits to program staff and, accordingly, has piqued renewed interest among applied program evaluators. In particular, the field has witnessed increasing application of a post-program-only data collection strategy in which only posttest and retrospective pretest data are collected. A post-program-only assessment strategy takes considerably less time than is required for collecting pre-program data and presumably has the added benefit of eliminating the impact of response-shift bias. Response-shift bias occurs when the knowledge, skills, or experiences participants gain through program participation leads them to interpret questionnaire items in a qualitatively different manner at pretest versus posttest. In this article, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses associated with administering retrospective pretest assessments and underscore the importance of thoroughly evaluating any application of a retrospective measurement strategy prior to its broader implementation. We provide a practical illustration of this evaluation process using a mixed-method study that assesses one measure of parenting education program effectiveness\u2014the Parenting Skills Ladder.

Thus, the aim of this study was to identify factors influencing the adoption, implementation and maintenance of the Svendborgproject (SP) - an effective real-world programme comprising schools to implement triple the amount of physical education (PE) in pre-school to sixth grade in six primary schools in the municipality of Svendborg, Denmark. SP has been maintained for ten years and scaled up to all municipal schools since it was initiated in 2008. The Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance framework (RE-AIM) was applied as an analytic tool through a convergent mixed method triangulation design. Results show that SP has been implemented with high fidelity and become an established part of the municipality and school identity. The successful implementation and dissemination of the programme has been enabled through the introduction of a predominantly bottom-up approach combined with simple non-negotiable requirements. The results show that this combination has led to a better fit of programmes to the individual school context while still obtaining high implementation fidelity. Finally, the early integration of research has legitimated and benefitted the programme. Health promotion; Physical just the right thing to do: Conceptualizing a theory of change for a school food and beverage sales environment interv ention and implications for implementation evaluation School food environments are the target of nutrition interventions and evaluations across the globe. Yet little work to-date has articulated the importance of developing a theory of change upon which to base evaluation of both implementation and outcomes. This paper undertakes an interpretive approach to develop a retrospective theory of change for an implementation evaluation of British Columbia's school food and beverage sales Guidelines. This study contributes broadly to a nuanced conceptualization of this type of public health intervention and provides a methodological contribution on how to develop a retrospective theory of change with implications for effective evaluation. Data collection strategies included document analysis, semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, and participant observation. Developing the logic model revealed that, despite the broad population health aims of the intervention, the main focus of implementation is to change behaviors of adults who create school food environments. Derived from the analysis and interpretation of the data, the emergent program theory focuses on the assumption that if adults are responsibilized through information and education campaigns and provided implementation tools, they will be 'convinced' to implement changes to school food environments to foster broader public health goals. These findings highlight the importance of assessing individual-level implementation indicators as well as the more often evaluated measures of food and beverage availability.

Given the policy's importance and complexity, an elaborated monitoring and evaluation system has been established. While attention has been dedicated to evaluating policy impact, the monitoring of inputs (i.e., allocated financial resources) has been limited to the control of financial dimensions (i.e., funds' absorption rate). As the implementation process entails a sequence of steps, this research explores whether financial proxies alone are adequate to monitor the policy inputs. To test this hypothesis, a system dynamics model is built. Simulations highlight that the absorption rate captures shocks that might occur during the inputs' expenditure with significant delay. To that end, we elaborate three novel operative monitoring indicators (i.e., funds' demand, funds' offer, procedural efficiency), which may overcome the financial indicators' mono-dimensionality and time lags' limitations. Cohesion Policy; article How and why are Theory of Change and Realist Evaluation used in food security contexts? A scoping review The complex ways in which food security actions lead to nutrition and other health outcomes make it important to clarify what programs work and how, with theory-driven evaluation emerging as a promising approach to evaluate complex programs. However, it is unclear how and why theory-driven evaluation is applied in food security contexts. Our objective is to examine the development and use of Theory of Change and Realist Evaluation to support food security programs globally. Using a systematic search and screening process, we included studies that described a food security program, used a Theory of Change or Realist Evaluation, and presented original research or evaluations. We found a total of 59 relevant Theory of Change studies and eight Realist Evaluation studies. Based on our analysis, Theories of Change arose in response to three main problems: 1) the need to evaluate under complexity; 2) challenges with evaluation; and, 3) information gaps surrounding a program. In contrast, Realist Evaluation was reported to be developed primarily to understand a program's outcomes. Reflecting on the problem to be addressed in the evaluation would help improve understandings of the evaluation context, which would then inform the choice and design of an evaluation approach.

To discover the potential value and evaluation of the night market, we interviewed 46 experts from several industries and occupations in Taiwan to investigate the relationships between brand equity, benefits, motivations of and satisfaction with night market tourism and development. The results show that travel motivation has both direct and indirect effects on brand equity, benefits and satisfaction. Furthermore, customer satisfaction is the most critical performance attribute of night market tourism, which may be influenced by brand equity, benefit, and motivation.

The drivers of change in M&E systems over the last 50 years have included a series of health concerns that have animated global donors (e.g., family planning, vaccination campaigns, and HIV/AIDS); the data requirements of donors; improved national economies enabling LMICs to invest more in M&E systems; and rapid advances in digital technologies. Progress has included the training and expansion of an M&E workforce, the creation of systems for data collection and use, and processes for assessing and ensuring data quality. Controversies have included the development of disease-specific systems that do not coordinate with each other, and a growing burden on health care deliverers to collect data for a proliferating number of health and process indicators. Digital technologies offer the promise of real time data and quick adaptation but also raise ethical and privacy concerns. The desire for speed can cast large-scale evaluations, considered by some to be the gold standard, in an unfavorable light as slow and expensive. Accordingly, there is a growing demand for speedy evaluations that rely on routine health information systems and privately collected \"big data\" from electronic health records and social media.

Behavioural interventions are rarely developed systematically and, when reported, inadequate description often becomes a barrier for subsequent replication and scalability. In this article, we describe the development and characteristics of Move for Life, an intervention to reach and help inactive adults aged 50 years and older increase their physical activity. It was designed to fit within existing group-based structured physical activity programmes run by Local Sports Partnerships, thus maximising the likelihood of translation into policy and practice. Constructs from social cognitive theory, self-determination theory, and the conceptual model of group cohesion in exercise informed the conceptual model and the development of behavioural skills, social support, and group cohesion intervention strategies. Physical activity instructors supported by peer mentors, who also contributed to sustaining the intervention, implemented these strategies. Moving away from accounts of intervention development as a relatively simple linear process, we illustrate the complex interplay of theory, evidence, practice, and real-world contextual circumstances that shaped the development of Move for Life. Against this backdrop, we discuss issues relevant to the planning and reporting of behavioural and physical activity interventions in public health.

We discuss lessons learned from an evaluation completed for the International Development Research Centre's Food, Environment and Health (FEH) program, which investigated the integration and outcomes of five strategic program priorities: partnerships, southern leadership, gender and equity, scale, and environmental sustainability. We present interpretations from a secondary, thematic content analysis that categorized evaluation findings across four complexity constructs: emergence, unpredictability, contradiction and self-organization. Viewing the evaluation through these constructs surfaced some important features of the FEH program to date, specifically its evolving approach, adaptiveness to emergent issues, non-linear outcomes, and self-organizing agents, which had several implications for the evaluative process. We conclude that the most appropriate evaluation designs for complex funding programs are participatory (to explore all stakeholders' influence), adaptive (to capture the unexpected) and assess external contexts. The application of complexity constructs may be useful for evaluators to gain a deeper understanding of how program contexts change in the face of complexity and why some evaluation methods work more effectively than others.

While numerous interventions to address vaccination uptake exist, vaccination rates remain low. We conducted a concept mapping exercise to solicit perspectives on barriers and facilitators to HPV vaccination from state-level stakeholders in five states in the Midwest and West Coast of the U.S. We identified 10 clusters of barriers and facilitators based on participants' statements. For rural areas specifically, clusters rated as most important included education and provider influence; those rated as most feasible were education and coordinated/consistent messaging. Our results suggest that a combination of important (but potentially more difficult to implement) strategies, combined with those rated as most feasible (but potentially less impactful) may be beneficial. Our findings highlight similarities across diverse states, suggesting that states can learn from each other and work together to improve HPV vaccination rates. Using concept mapping proved to be an efficient way to collect information from diverse, stakeholders in different locations, and is a methodology that could be used for program planning in areas beyond HPV vaccination.

When an evaluation includes cost and efficiency considerations, economic and other concepts can be added to a theory of change to articulate a theory of value creation that articulates the mechanisms by which the intervention should use resources efficiently, effectively and create sufficient value to justify the resource use. Value for money; Cost-benefit analysis; and transformations for evaluators and economists As evaluators and economists expand their domains of research, consulting, teaching, and publication, they find themselves needing each other more and yet increasingly at odds. Often surprised at the resistance they encounter from one another, sometimes dismissive of contributions the other can make, all should consider adaptations and transformations of roles, approaches, methods, analyses, and decision-making algorithms that would allow better collaboration. The particularly multidisciplinary area of cost-inclusive evaluation requires (a) changes in approaches and methods used by evaluators and economists, (b) changes that evaluators need to make when working with economists, and (c) changes that economists need to make when working with evaluators. Some of the changes needed are illustrated with examples drawn from proposals and manuscripts for contemporary cost-inclusive evaluations. A key reframing needed is that cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses are \"and\" rather than \"or\" activities: cost-inclusive evaluation works best, and perhaps only really works, when evaluators and economists interweave their efforts to support and learn from each other.

The Casebook was shared and semi-structured interviews were conducted with established and developing EIMC-OC groups. Five themes discussing the usability, value, and future directions of the Casebook were identified. Participants implemented the Casebook to varying degrees, found it to be a valuable communication medium, and recommended revisions, which may enhance its implementation. The EIMC-OC Casebook is a valuable tool that exemplifies campus-based efforts to promote physical activity, augments between-group communication, and helps groups conduct effective initiatives. Program leaders and researchers may benefit from a similar Casebook approach, and recommendations are provided to evaluators aiming to enhance the effectiveness of multi-site programs.

Most correctional institutions constitute conservative and closed societies. Generally, people do not have sufficient knowledge or understanding of penal correction. Therefore, it is difficult but necessary to break the stereotyped impression people hold about correctional institutions, actively integrate them into society, and encourage people to assume a more humane attitude towards correctional institutions. We conducted an inductive analysis of Penghu Prison administered by the Agency of Corrections, Ministry of Justice, Taiwan. After creating evaluation indices for the development of more humane correctional institutions, we conducted a survey to classify the evaluation indices into criteria under the four major evaluation dimensions. Using DEMATEL, we determined the causal relationship among different evaluation indicators and generated an influential network relation map about the evaluation criteria. Using DANP, we subsequently calculated weightings for the influence of each criterion. Finally, using the modified VIKOR, we conducted a gap analysis. The results of this study can be used to build a more positive and human reputation for correctional institutions and enable their sustainable creation.

Regional health authorities have implemented integrated WNV surveillance following a One Health approach, based on collaboration between human, animal and environmental health institutions. We evaluated this integrated WNV surveillance system in Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy and Piedmont regions by means of a process evaluation. We examined the system's implementation fidelity, dose delivered and received, reach, and we identified strengths and weaknesses in the system. Qualitative and semi-quantitative data were obtained from three regional focus groups. Data were discussed in a follow up focus group, where participants suggested recommendations for improving the surveillance system.

Evaluators and decision-makers should, therefore, continuously seek to explore the use of tools that can produce more meaningful, insightful, and useful data so that decision-making can be enhanced and improved. Traditional economic appraisal methods offer much and are very useful and relevant. Standard financial accounting reporting for tax purposes also provide insightful information on the organization's financial health and that of its individual programs. However, neither offer insight into cost behavior\u2014an important consideration for making program operations more efficient and for long-term strategic planning, forecasting, and design of program operations. Before COVID-19, programs were already challenged with competition for donor dollars and the pursuit for financial sustainability. The COVID-19 environment has considerably exacerbated these challenges. In this current environment, it is more important than ever for nonprofits to optimize limited financial resources to do more societal good. This paper will illustrate how selected concepts from cost and management accounting can be used by both independent program evaluators to improve their recommendations, as well as program administrators in-charge of nonprofits to enhance decision-making.

Therefore, preventing children from becoming overweight is a major public health challenge. Here, we used a mixed-method research approach - including a quasi-experimental design and three surveys - to create a formative evaluation of a social marketing campaign on healthy nutrition and lifestyle in Italian primary school children. The social marketing campaign was organized around the 4 Ps of the marketing mix (product: the educational activities; place: the involved schools the in-person and technology-based communication; and price: hours spent by the targeted children in fulfilling the educational activities). The campaign involved primary-school children across four Italian cities. The findings suggest that social marketing education campaigns can be effective tools to improve children's knowledge about healthy food and lifestyle, reduce their sedentary behavior, and increase their consumption of healthy food. Also, increasing children's acceptance of healthful nourishment is a valuable tool to improve the dietary habits of the entire family. With relation to the educational program assessment method, this study can inform societal interventions especially those involving children through the integration of different qualitative and quantitative research methods, which collect data from different subjects and perspectives. Social marketing education campaign; Children's nutrition and article Video-based observation in impact evaluation This paper reviews the literature on the use of video-based observation (VBO) with particular attention to monitoring and evaluation (M&E) on development projects. While the use of video both as a research tool and as a strategy for supporting professional development is well-documented across several disciplines, the extent to which VBO has been utilized in M&E contexts is less clearly defined. In order to provide theoretically-grounded recommendations for the development and implementation of one organisation's innovative VBO impact evaluation scheme, this review examines recent evidence of VBO in M&E contexts and draws on VBO literature more generally to identify its advantages and challenges together with advice for enhancing its effectiveness. Based on this analysis, the paper highlights a number of practical issues that should be considered when VBO is being developed for M&E in development contexts, particularly where videos are being made by participants themselves. The value of VBO in responding to COVID-19 and reducing carbon emissions is also noted.

The current study aimed to examine the short- and long-term (12-month follow-up) effectiveness of SSL, depending on implementation fidelity. Participants were 123 Spanish-speaking children aged 6-8 years with internalizing symptoms and their parents. High (n = 41) and low fidelity (n = 26) groups were established and compared with a control group (CG) (n = 56). Compared to CG, the high-fidelity group (HFG) achieved better outcomes than the low-fidelity group (LFG) at short and long term, including symptoms of anxiety, depression, and internalizing problems, and also externalizing problems at long-term. The LFG improved key symptoms at short term (depression) and long term (anxiety and depression). Findings suggest that SSL is beneficial even if not delivered at maximum fidelity, although considering the influence of implementation fidelity is critical because the high-fidelity implementation yielded the greatest effects when compared to the CG. This research provides valuable data, analyzing for the first time the influence of fidelity on SSL outcomes in young school-aged children exhibiting internalizing symptoms, while there is still a lack of studies of these characteristics concerning transdiagnostic prevention programs targeting childhood anxiety and depression.

Study protocol for two realist explanatory case studies Evidence on health inequalities has grown in recent decades, however, the capacity to generate health inequalities research is uneven, worldwide. A recent bibliometric analysis found notable inequalities of the global production of health inequalities scientific research across countries. What determines the capacity to produce high volumes of health inequalities scientific research, in different settings? What mechanisms are involved? To answer these questions requires in-depth knowledge on the health inequalities research production process, in different settings. We plan to conduct two realist explanatory case studies, to understand why and how particular settings (e.g. the United Kingdom and the city of Barcelona) have generated high volumes of health inequalities research over past decades, and identify the potential key contextual conditions and causal mechanisms involved. This study protocol outlines the rationale and methodology involved, highlights the strengths and limitations of the approach, and provides guidance on how to overcome certain operational challenges and ensure validity of research findings. Valuable learning may be derived from these case experiences, with implications for research, policy and practice. This work can serve as a tool for researcher and planners to guide the development of further case studies to evaluate health inequalities research capacities in other settings.

In the PK-12 education sector, school-based teacher collaboration is the primary vehicle through which educators are able to gain access to essential social capital, and through which leaders promulgate diffusion of innovation and continuous organizational learning. In partnership with school administrators, the authors undertook an evaluation to examine the size, structure, and composition of school-based networks. Social network analysis (SNA) was used to measure and visualize connections (or lack thereof) of ties between teams and between educators. Isolate and disconnected network actors were revealed through visual inspection of the sociograms. Administrators used findings to reconfigure team membership to enhance teacher ability to give and receive support and collaboratively problem-solve, and to ensure greater capacity for diffusion of instructional innovation and organizational learning. This paper contributes to the field's understanding of how evaluators and organizational leaders can use SNA to measure, visualize, and more purposefully design effective patterns of connection between people through which professional knowledge, support, and innovation will travel.

In this way, the present study proposes an evaluative approach that aims to measure efficiency taking into account the diverse activities characteristic of university institutions. To this end, a data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach, known as Network DEA, is used, which encompasses the different processes and subprocesses that take place within these institutions. In all, the evaluation considers eleven variables organized in three distinct stages, which reflect the performance of the HEIs in different perspectives: financial, undergraduate level and graduate level (student training and scientific production and innovation). Finally, the model was applied at 45 Brazilian federal universities. This case study allows a comprehensive efficiency analysis to be carried out for the set of institutions considered, from each perspective taken into account in the approach. Higher education; Efficiency evaluation; Network DEA; UPSTREAM! Together evaluation results from community efforts to prevent mental, emotional, and behavioral health problems Mental, emotional, and behavioral (MEB) health problems are prevalent globally. Despite effective programs that can prevent MEB problems and promote mental health, there has not been widespread adoption. UPSTREAM! Together was a planning project in three Colorado communities. Communities partnered with academic and policy entities to 1) translate evidence about MEB problem prevention into locally-relevant messages and materials and 2) develop long-term plans for broad implementation of interventions to prevent high-priority MEB problems. Community members recognized the need to talk about MEB problems to prevent them. The UPSTREAM! communities localized messages designed to start conversations and sustain attention on preventing MEB problems. The communities understood that prevention takes sustained community attention and advocacy, knowing that important outcomes may be years away. Long-term implementation plans aimed to strengthen families and enhance social connections among youth. Despite community readiness and capacity to implement evidence-based programs, there were few funding opportunities, delaying program implementation and revealing gaps between funding policies and community readiness. This community-engaged experience suggests an achievable approach, acceptable to communities, and worthy of further development and testing. Policies that cultivate and support local expertise may help to increase wider community adoption of evidence-based programs that promote mental health among youth. Prevention; Community John M.

All but one hospice offered multiple different bereavement programs, with routine in-house evaluations of all programs performed. In all cases, staff and client unsolicited and solicited comments made during and at the end of each program provided data for continuing program refinement. Most hospices also routinely employed a self-devised questionnaire to gain specific sought information to retain or change programs. Other information, including news about program developments elsewhere, was also actively sought for program adoption or for the improvement of existing programs. With most bereavement programs having been in place for many years, participants were confident their programs are needed, safe, and effective.

The study builds on a partnership evaluation framework that identifies practices related to preconditions, factors linked with success, implementation structures and processes, contribution of collaboration to performance, and collaboration outcomes. A survey instrument developed statements of positive practices and asked respondents to agree or disagree with each one. The analysis includes exploration of differences in perception. Respondents generally expressed agreement with the statements in the survey instrument associated with the various dimensions of effective partnerships. All projects mentioned the presence of partnership champions. Problems with joint action (e.g., planning, budgeting, managing) were the most frequently cited constraints. The study confirms most of the hypotheses embedded in the evaluation framework regarding partnership's potential for creating synergies and improved outcomes and affirms the framework's usefulness as a developmental evaluation tool. Positive outcomes result from intentional efforts to build relationships, cultivate champions, and design systems and processes that support a partnership culture and contribute to each partners' success as well as the success of the partnership itself.

Embedding this work in Ghere, King, Stevahn, and Minnema (2006) Essential Competencies for Program Evaluators Self-Assessment (ECPE), researchers investigated student perceptions of their evaluator competencies, scored end-of-course proposals, and interviewed program leaders to understand differences between the two teaching methods, as well as the extent to which the applied evaluation component of the master's-level course may have impacted differential, practice-based outcomes. Researchers analyzed program leader interviews and student data derived via survey, and a six-person team analyzed students' end-of-course proposals. Findings showed master's-level students independently rated all applied components of their course significantly higher than their and their PhD counterparts' rating of the theoretical components, which partially aligned with results of students' final, end-of-course proposals.

This objective was operationalized as the following question: How did facilitators manage to buy in to, and align themselves with, program principles while avoiding an expert stance and remaining focused on participating families' strengths? This question has not been investigated before in connection with the SFP program. This study was conducted between 2011 and 2014, and relied on semi-annual group interviews. The results indicate that facilitators' first step was to acknowledge their expectations. Once they had accomplished this, they were able to let go and distance themselves from an expert stance. This allowed them to recognize the benefits flowing from application of the program's principles, and understand how they could repurpose their expertise for intervention with program participants. Facilitators also came to realize that they had developed strong relationships with the families and better understood the latter's realities. Finally, this article explores the implications of the results, both for practice (in terms of program compliance) and research (in terms of program evaluation). Evaluation research - Qualitative approach - Challenges - Buy-in - Families facing difficulties; of program participants: Endogenous evaluative criteria Evaluative conclusions are grounded in implicit and explicit criteria that describe a successful or high-quality intervention. Most often, evaluative criteria are drawn from program objectives that reflect the values and priorities of program designers and funders. Yet, an exclusive focus on program goals risks overlooking the values of program participants, the extent to which their actual needs and priorities are addressed, and, in certain types of programs, the choices participants make and agency they exercise. This article presents concepts and methods to guide evaluators in drawing some of the criteria used in an evaluation from program participants. The article outlines a typology of evaluative criteria and seven methods for drawing outcomes-focused criteria from program participants. The article concludes with a discussion of implications and future directions for research and practice.

The present study proposes a relatively objective approach, hierarchical data envelopment analysis (H-DEA), to rank higher education systems. Unlike the subjective approach, H-DEA utilizes endogenous weight determination, allowing assessors to identify the relative importance of each attribute and subattribute. Utilizing the U21 Ranking of National Higher Education System 2020 data, our analysis indicates that the output attribute is a crucial factor influencing the overall performance of higher education systems, even considering countries' stage of development and culture. The computed weights of the H-DEA framework show various attributes' different contributions by group. Resources allocated to the higher education system are important for developing countries, while a high degree of internationalization and a strong link between academia and industry matter for advanced countries. Surprisingly, Asian and Western cultures experience similar performance in their higher education systems, reflecting the Asian higher education system's development toward the Western style. The performance of countries with non-Asian-non-Western cultures, as expected, lags behind, and putting more resources into these countries' higher education system is a way to enhance the overall performance.

Parental education programs are a key element in achieving family reunification because they help mothers and fathers improve their parenting skills and increase the parent-child relationship. Perceptions of change are examined among children and parents who participated in Spain's \"Caminar en familia\" (\"Walking family\") program, which was implemented among families served by the Sistema de Protecci\u00f3n a la Infancia y a la Adolescencia (System for the Protection of Children and Adolescents). A qualitative design enabled comprehensively describing the experiences of families in the Spanish Child Protection System. A discussion group was the main data collection source. Study participants were from 16 families (23 parents and 20 children), either preparing to return home or newly reunified, and had completed Modules 3 and 4 of the program. The results indicated that the program contributed to increasing families' awareness of their parenting-related abilities, skills, and competencies, and helped them understand the need for making adjustments as part of coexistence and preparations for adaptations in family dynamics to facilitate the children's return home. This research highlights the importance of involving parents and their children in improving parenting skills and the reunification process by implementing parental education programs through a unique work plan.

This was done by using a Likert-type evaluation instrument consisting of 21 items with an excellent reliability score for the general scale (Cronbach = 0.955) and specifically for the school climate dimension ( = 0.969) and school satisfaction ( = 0.927). The instrument was applied to a sample of 2189 subjects (1881 teachers and 308 members of the school management team) at 85 schools in Spain where ISO:9001 has been implemented for at least 3 years. The results show that implementation of this QMS has generally had a medium level impact on school climate and on satisfaction among the teachers, students, and families at the schools in the sample. Moreover, descriptive and differential analyses have been carried out to identify any significant differences in the impact of implementing the QMS on improvements in the two dimensions as a function of the position, gender, seniority at the school, ownership, and size of the school, and length of time with the QMS implemented there. In addition, other analyses were carried out using single-variant general linear models that revealed an effect of interaction between the variables of position and age. Furthermore, cluster analyses were also performed to identify three teacher and management profiles attending to the levels of improvement brought about from implanting the QMS on the dimensions under study. Quality Management Systems; as a moral practice: The case of virtue ethics Evaluation is a moral practice. With this in mind, we look to moral philosophy and the theory of virtue ethics as a case study to identify instances where virtue ethics undergirds professional evaluation. To aid in this we also contrast virtue ethics with the more commonly discussed philosophies of consequentialism and deontology and their corresponding evaluation practices. An important question we hope to address is: why does it matter for evaluators to understand connections between moral philosophy and practice? We argue that a greater awareness of moral philosophy will aid evaluators in seeing both the plurality of moral considerations that undergird an evaluation practice, as well as aid in their ability to make judgements among these considerations. In particular, identifying the moral perspectives that ground evaluation practices will aid in evaluation flexibility and use by helping evaluators to tailor evaluations to the situations and moral issue at hand and bringing evaluations explicitly closer to their implicit moral roots.

Five categories of assessment, a program evaluation framework, logic model, theory of change, project plan, metrics spreadsheet, and the A+ Inquiry model are synthesized to demonstrate how they supported the development of an evaluation plan. Types of evidence are described to provide an overview of the need for improved instructional supports relevant to educator data utilization, how the activities to develop and implement an online curriculum are appropriate to meet the need, how well the activities are implemented as planned, and the extent to which intended outcomes of the curriculum are achieved. Applying the methods outlined in this paper yielded a plan to help ensure the curriculum would be assessed through a comprehensive evaluation lens. Limitations are acknowledged. Methods described in this paper could be adapted to support program evaluation planning and implementation beyond the scope of this project.

The evaluation work reported here was carried out in a more challenging context, where large, complex, interwoven systems were targets for change as a means to influence a diffuse array of outcomes. Our evaluation of an NIH-funded program to improve statewide infrastructure for clinical and translational health research (\"Advance-CTR\") used qualitative data provided by investigators who used the program's services, were funded awardees, or were members of an internal advisory committee (leadership representatives from partnering institutions). We examined perceived barriers to systemic changes to enhance research, as well as how systems have changed due to the Rhode Island Advance-CTR program's efforts, to what degree, and with what effects. Using the causal logic of our program to connect these more distal systemic outcomes to the services and components of Advance-CTR, we discuss the effects this program has had on researchers and their environments, contributing to the development of sustainable programs of research that ultimately improve the health and well-being of our state's residents.

My Strengths Training for Life (MST4Life) uses a strengths-based approach with the aim to improve young people's resilience, self-worth, wellbeing and engagement in education, employment, and training. This mixed methods study assessed the fidelity of delivery style of the MST4Life programme, the extent to which frontline service staff can delivery psychologically informed programmes to service users and identified barriers and enablers to delivering with fidelity to the intended style. Observations of programme delivery (two facilitators per session) took place across early, middle, and late phases of the programme across a pilot phase (n = 18) and main study (n = 45). Facilitators also completed self-reflection forms following each session. The mean observation score was 82.2 \u00b1 15.7 %, and facilitator self-report mean adherence score was 89.3 \u00b1 6.2 % which indicate that the programme was delivered with high fidelity. Quantitative data was also analysed using non-parametric statistical test (Mann-Whitney U Test). There was a significant difference between observation scores for deliverers with postgraduate psychology training compared to deliverers without postgraduate psychology training (p = .029). Qualitative data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Barriers and enablers included communication, frontline staff support, logistics, and participant behaviours. Overall, this study highlights that despite the challenges of delivering complex community programmes to young people experiencing homelessness, it was possible for frontline service staff to deliver MST4Life with high fidelity.

It provides data to judge whether the program attained its goals and to help plan future training. This study aimed to implement an exploratory sequential research framework to evaluate the Master Trainer-Faculty Professional Development Program (MT-FPFP). MT-FPDP was a teachers training program designed for higher education faculty to develop their teaching skills. The current study was divided into two phases. In phase I, qualitative data was collected through document analysis and semi-structured interviews with coordinators of MT-FPDP. A self-developed questionnaire was used for data collection from Master Trainers (MTs) in phase II. Thematic analysis, percentages, and mean scores were used to analyze the data. The findings indicated that exploratory sequential framework was a best fit for evaluating MT-FPD. MT-FPDP was discovered to be a successful university-level teachers' training program. MTs encountered several challenges during the cascade training process at Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). This work contributes to the literature from both an academic and a practical standpoint. First, this study contributes to the literature by implementing exploratory sequential framework as an evaluation design and by providing detailed information regarding the training program's objectives, design, process, implementation, and challenges. Secondly, policy-makers and decision-makers will benefit from the results of the current study. In addition, exploratory sequential framework can aid future evaluators and researchers in systematic evaluations of teachers' training and other programs both inside and outside the education profession.

Using data from the Mid-South Congregational Health Survey, top health needs (physical, mental, social determinants of health) were identified, and differences in needs by key demographic variables (age, sex, race/ethnicity, education) were examined. Church leaders and members (N = 828) from 92 churches reported anxiety/depression (65 %), hypertension/stroke (65 %), stress (62 %), affordable healthcare (60 %), and overweight/obesity (58 %) as the top health needs in their congregations. Compared to individuals < 55 years old and with a college degree, individuals 55 years old (ORrange=1.50-1.86) and with high school degree (ORrange=1.55-1.91) were more likely to report mental health needs (anxiety/depression; stress). African Americans were less likely to report physical health needs (hypertension/stroke; overweight/obesity) than individuals categorized as Another race/ethnicity (ORrange=0.38-0.60). Individuals with high school degree were more likely to report affordable healthcare as a need compared to individuals with some college or a college degree (ORrange=1.58). This research highlights the need for evaluators and planners to design programs that are comprehensive in their approach to addressing the health needs of congregations while also considering demographic variation that may impact program participation and engagement.

This study examines ways of enhancing community participation in environmental health-related initiatives in rural areas of Tanzania. A total of one hundred people (n = 100) were engaged in this study. An embedded case study design was employed, in which multiple methods such as household questionnaires, in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and document analysis were used in collecting empirical data. Findings show that integration of the community into the development agenda and facilitating communities to access required equipment and tools is vital for enabling participation in environmental health-related matters. Effective and efficient leadership, mobilisation, and sensitisation of communities are operational and functioning strategies to improve environmental health through community participation, while retribution measures may prevent environmental pollution. There is a definite need for the integration of community participation as a key aspect of environmental-related projects and programs in the development policy aiming at improving the environmental health of communities.

This paper explores evaluation methods of four fully or partially public-funded agricultural research organisations and how they are building evaluative capacity to respond to the impact agenda. Drawing on cross-organisational comparison of the readiness of each organisation to implement evaluation, the implications for improving evaluative capacity building (ECB) are discussed. This study extends the current literature on ECB, as very little has focussed on research organisations in general, and particularly agricultural research. Driven by the impact agenda, the organisations are beginning to emphasise summative evaluation. Organisational leaders valuing the demonstration of impact and commitment to building evaluation capacity are important precursors to other aspects of organisational readiness to implement evaluation. However, organisational emphasis remains on using evaluation for accountability and to improve efficiency and allocation of funding. The organisations have yet to systematically embed evaluation processes and capabilities for learning at programme and organisation-levels. There is, therefore, an opportunity to develop organisation and programme-level evaluation processes that inform each other and the pathways to impact from science. To realise this opportunity, organisations could strengthen internal and external networks of evaluation practitioners and academics to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of monitoring and evaluation for learning (MEL) and to begin to reshape organisational culture by using evaluation methods that are grounded in co-production and integrated scientific and societal values. agricultural research impact; monitoring and evaluation, evaluation capacity building; C 2022 94 S0149718922000817 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149718922000817 Turner, James A Guesmi, Bouali Gil, Jos\u00e9 M.

This work investigates the effect of containment policies and economic support measures on economic growth in the short run, investigating a time window of six quarters in a cross country perspective. Our results confirm the existence of a negative effect of stringency measures on GDP; we also detect a positive effect from economic support measures. Moreover, looking at the interaction between these two kinds of interventions, our findings suggest that up to a relatively low level of stringency policies, economic support measures are able to positively counterbalance the negative impact of containment and closure policies. When the level of closures became more severe, however, the economic support measures that countries adopt are not able to completely recoup, in the short run, the economic losses due to stringency policies. Results suggest that in order to have a positive net effect, policymakers should take into account the level of stringency measures implemented before investing in economic support. COVID-19; social media-based intervention in reducing youths' propensity to engage in drug abuse in Nigeria Drug abuse is one of the serious social problems facing the globe today. There have been cases of young people under the influence of drugs; engaging in different crimes such as kidnapping, rape, and armed robbery. The goal of this study was to test the effectiveness of social media-based intervention in reducing drug abuse propensity among youths in Nigeria. The design of the study was a two-way ANOVA with repeated measures. The Substance Abuse Proclivity (SAP) scale was used to collect data for the study. The study showed that social media-based intervention effectively reduced drug abuse propensity for participants in the treatment group compared with those in the control group. A follow-up intervention after two years shows a steady decline in drug abuse propensity among youth in the treatment group, unlike those in the control group. Comparatively, the training skills type of intervention was more effective than motivational interviewing. Drug abuse; Social media; The importance of administrative data in the evaluation of the incidence of social housing allowance programmes The aim of this work is to assess the rental assistance programme that was implemented by the Catalan regional government in the 2010s using administrative data provided by the Catalonia Housing Agency to analyse whether it achieved its aims to enhance the design of similar programmes. Linear probability models to explain the probability of receiving the grant were estimated and some significant variables were identified: age; rent price; expertise; being a woman; non-EU citizenship and the number of old, young or disabled members. Multiple regressions were estimated in regard to the grant's rate in relation to the rent price and the effort required to pay relative to income after having received the grant. The results suggest that rental assistance facilitates access to housing to groups that face more difficulties and that the revenue captured by landlords, although statistically significant, is small, since they capture approximately 3% by raising prices. This aid, despite being controlled by different variables, benefits elderly people more than young people, which must be addressed because, theoretically, when access requirements are met, no group should benefit more than others.

Between 2015 and 2018 the scaling up of three varieties of yellow potatoes was carried out in Colombia within the framework of the \"More Nutritious Potatoes\" project, which had results beyond the objectives and goals proposed in a period of 28 months. One of the results of the project was the design of a Scaling-up model of innovations that linked agriculture with nutrition. This article answers the question: Which were the elements of the scaling-up model that allowed the results obtained in the More Nutritious Potatoes Project? To respond, a set of reference criteria was constructed from the literature. These criteria were contrasted with the theoretical project scaling-up model and its subsequent implementation in the field, using focus groups as a methodology and the model design analysis and its execution by the leaders and the evaluator of the project. The project's Scaling-up Model (SM) was found to include all benchmarks, in addition to identify three key elements that made the results possible: (i) the characteristics of the innovation, (ii) the trans-disciplinary work and (iii) facilitating elements of the process. The results of this exercise complement the evaluated scaling-up model and become benchmarks in the design of innovation scaling-up processes.

The literature to date, however, lacks examples of state level policy strategies that promote evidence-based practices (EBPs). This mixed-methods study documents changes in two critical state-to-provider strategies aimed at accelerating use of evidence-based practices: purchasing levers (financial incentives and mechanisms) and policy or regulatory levers. A sample of 51 state representatives was interviewed. Single State Authorities for substance abuse treatment (SSAs) that fund providers directly or through managed care were significantly more likely to have contracts that required or encouraged evidence-based interventions, as compared to SSAs that fund providers indirectly through sub-state entities. Policy levers included EBP-related legislation, language in rules and regulations, and evidence-based criteria in state plans and standards. These differences in state policy are likely to result in significant state level variations regarding both the extent to which EBPs are implemented by community-based treatment providers and the quality of implementation.

A case study was conducted of efforts to evaluate the new protected area management system in Trinidad and Tobago using a participatory approach. The aim of the case study was to (1) examine whether stakeholder involvement better captures the multi-faceted nature of success and (2) identify the role and influence of various stakeholder groups in this process. An holistic and systematic framework was developed with stakeholder input that facilitated the integration of expert and lay knowledge, a broad emphasis on ecological, socio-economic, and institutional aspects, and the use of both quantitative and qualitative data allowing the evaluation to capture the multi-faceted nature and impacts of protected area management. Input from primary stakeholders, such as local communities, was critical as they have a high stake in protected area outcomes. Secondary and external stakeholders, including government agencies, non-governmental organizations, academia and the private sector, were also important in providing valuable technical assistance and serving as mediators. However, a lack of consensus over priorities, politics, and limited stakeholder capacity and data access pose significant barriers to engaging stakeholders to effectively measure the management success of protected areas.

Given that most economies are now in recession, policymakers are looking to small firms to act as engines of economic growth; this has led to a revived interest in the role of enterprise policy. The 'new' enterprise policy is systemic, promoting and shaping externalities and capabilities. At its core are R&D, innovation and education. It encapsulates a shift from direct intervention towards creating an enabling environment for small firms and entrepreneurship. At present there is a research lacuna regarding the evaluation of such policies. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by making two key contributions. First, I demonstrate that traditional enterprise evaluation metrics are too narrow: they focus almost exclusively on private firm impacts, rather than broader societal impacts caused by the pervasive nature of 'new' enterprise policies. Second, I illustrate how logic models could be expanded to account for these broader impacts.

CSIRO is Australia's national science agency and is a publicly funded part of Australia's innovation system. It conducts mission-driven scientific research focussed on delivering results with relevance and impact for Australia, where impact is defined and measured in economic, environmental and social terms at the national level. The Australian Government has recently signalled an increasing emphasis on performance assessment and evaluation, which in the CSIRO context implies an increasing emphasis on ensuring and demonstrating the impact of its research programs. CSIRO continues to develop and improve its approaches to impact planning and evaluation, including conducting a trial of a program logic approach in the CSIRO Preventative Health National Research Flagship. During the trial, improvements were observed in clarity of the research goals and path to impact, as well as in alignment of science and support function activities with national challenge goals. Further benefits were observed in terms of communication of the goals and expected impact of CSIRO's research programs both within CSIRO and externally. The key lesson learned was that significant value was achieved through the process itself, as well as the outcome. Recommendations based on the CSIRO trial may be of interest to managers of scientific research considering developing similar logic models for their research projects. The CSIRO experience has shown that there are significant benefits to be gained, especially if the project participants have a major role in the process of developing the logic model.

Despite inadequate evidence of relevance and effectiveness of TBA training programmes, there has been a policy shift since the 1990s in that many donor agencies funding TBA training programmes redirected funds to providing skilled attendants during delivery. This study aimed to assess the ways in which a TBA training programme in India has been successful in disseminating evidence-based knowledge on birthing practices. TBAs practicing within 16 villages targeted by training programme initiatives were administered with structured questionnaires. The post training birthing practices of trained (24) and untrained (14) TBAs was compared and birthing practices adopted by women assisted by trained (16) and untrained (9) TBAs was analysed. Positive post training practices were hand washing, use of a clean blade for cutting the cord, immediate breastfeeding and weighing of babies. Nevertheless, the training could be further improved with up to date and evidence-based information and more comprehensive instructions. The findings suggest an integration of local and evidence-based knowledge is needed to improve the training.

The outcomes of the self-evaluations of two schools are systematically compared: a novice school with little experience in competence-based education and assessment, and an innovative school with extensive experience. The self-evaluation was based on 12 quality criteria for CAPs, including both validity and reliability, and criteria stressing the importance of the formative function of assessment, such as meaningfulness and educational consequences. In each school, teachers, management and examination board participated. Results show that the two schools use different approaches to assure assessment quality. The innovative school seems to be more aware of its own strengths and weaknesses, to have a more positive attitude towards teachers, students, and educational innovations, and to explicitly involve stakeholders (i.e., teachers, students, and the work field) in their assessments. This school also had a more explicit vision of the goal of competence-based education and could design its assessments in accordance with these goals.

The Family Cap is a component of welfare reform policy that denies additional cash benefits to children born 10 or more months after a woman entered the welfare rolls. We use data from the New Jersey Family Development Program (FDP) evaluation that employed a classical experimental design. We find that fertility behaviors are influenced by both Family Cap price and message mechanisms but that these effects are conditioned by welfare recipients' time on welfare and race. Black women who have longer stays on welfare are more likely to be influenced by price while women with shorter stays are influenced by both price and the social message. We believe our results have implications not only for future public welfare policy initiatives but for any social policies that attempt to influence behavior directly, through individual rewards and punishments, and indirectly through the activation of social or community pressures.

Research into the factors that enable some coalitions and partnerships to meet the challenge when others fail is limited. This study begins to fill this gap in our understanding by examining influences on the process of sustainability planning in the context of a collaborative partnership focused on youth development. We report on a longitudinal examination of the quality of planning and attitudes underpinning the sustainability of PROSPER community prevention teams whose members implement evidence-based programs designed to support positive youth development and reduce early substance use and other problem behaviors. The current research concentrates on a particular dimension of partnership effectiveness to establish whether perceptions about team functioning in play at 6 and 18 months predict the quality of sustainability planning at 36 and 48 months. How well teams functioned in the early stages was found to be strongly related to the quality of their later preparations for sustainability. Recruitment and integration of new team members, and the encouragement they subsequently received were also found to be key factors. The results strengthen the argument for providing technical assistance to meet the needs of those who promote prevention partnerships, and they provide longitudinal empirical data to support the hypotheses of other researchers who have similarly found a correlation between effective sustainability and early planning and support.

Data are from 23 focus groups conducted with coalition members, and 76 semi-structured interviews with local coordinators and community leaders. Multiple case study methods were used to identify major themes related to how five contextual domains influenced collaborative planning and implementation. Results showed that history of collaboration can influence resources and interpersonal and organizational connections available for planning and implementation, as well as priorities selected for action. Community politics and history can affect which segments of the community participate in a planning process and what issues are prioritized, as well as the pool of partners willing to aid in implementation. Some community norms and values bring people together and others appear to limit involvement from certain groups. Community demographics and economic conditions may shape outreach strategies for planning and implementation, and may also shape priorities. Geography can play a role in assessment methods, priority selection, partners available to aid in implementation, and participation in activities and events. Results suggest that community context plays a substantive role in shaping how community-based health promotion projects unfold.

Using data from telephone interviews with 250 administrators of publicly funded SUD treatment programs, this study estimated a model of adoption of medication assisted treatment (MAT) for SUDs and examined the relative importance of regulatory, cultural, medical resource, patient-level, and funding barriers to MAT implementation. MAT-adopting programs had significantly greater medical resources, as measured by the employment of physicians and nurses, than non-adopting programs. Administrators of non-adopting programs were asked to rate the importance of 18 barriers to MAT implementation. The most strongly endorsed barriers were regulatory prohibitions due to the program's lack of medical staff, funding barriers to implementing MAT, and lack of access to medical personnel with expertise in delivering MAT. Barriers related to insufficient information about MAT and unsupportive staff attitudes were not widely endorsed. These findings suggest that efforts to promote the implementation of MAT that are inattentive to funding barriers and weaknesses in medical infrastructure may achieve sub-optimal results.

Phone interview responses from 172 CBO staff directly involved in EBP implementation were analyzed using content analysis, a method for making inferences and developing themes from the systematic review of participant narratives (Berelson, 1952).Results Staff described different types of barriers to implementing each EBP. For MI, the majority of barriers involved staff resistance or organizational setting. For A-CRA, the majority of barriers involved specific characteristics of the EBP or client resistance. For CBT, the majority of barriers were associated with client resistance, and for ACT, the majority of barriers were associated with resources.Discussion EBP designers, policy makers who support EBP dissemination and funders should include explicit strategies to address such barriers. Addiction programs proposing to use specific EBPs must consider whether their programs have the organizational capacity and community capacity to meet the demands of the EBP selected.

This paper presents a program evaluation drawn from volunteer counselor and user perceptions and experiences during the second year of operation of the NSAOH.Method Outcome data are presented from 731 session evaluations submitted by 94 volunteers and session evaluations from 4609 user sessions collected between June 1, 2008 and May 30, 2009. Evaluation includes ratings of usefulness, topics discussed, length of sessions, services provided, and session difficulties.Results The results indicate that the model is viable and useful, and the majority of volunteers and users are satisfied. Volunteer knowledge and skills are strongly associated with satisfaction with the hotline. Nevertheless, one-fifth of volunteers rate their session as not useful and users rate 8.2% of volunteers low in knowledge and skills.Discussion NSAOH is reaching many who have not previously sought services or did not resolve issues through other means. Findings suggest the importance of preparing volunteers in both crisis intervention and a wide variety of long-term issues related to sexual assault. Recommendations for program development, evaluation, and further research are presented.

A comprehensive content-based course criterion model extracted from existing literature and expert opinions was developed. Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was used to identify the relative importance of course criteria for the purpose of tailoring an optimal one-week immersion English as a second language (ESL) curriculum for elementary school students in a suburban county of Taiwan. The hierarchy model and AHP analysis utilized in the present study will be useful for resolving several important multi-criteria decision-making issues in planning and evaluating ESL programs.

Nevertheless, adoption of HIV testing in substance abuse treatment programs has been slow. This article describes the experience of a substance abuse treatment agency where, following participation in a clinical trial, the agency implemented an HIV testing and counseling program. During the trial, a post-trial pilot, and early implementation the agency identified challenges and developed strategies to overcome barriers to adoption of the intervention. Their experience may be instructive for other treatment providers seeking to implement an HIV testing program. Lessons learned encompassed the observed acceptability of testing and counseling to clients, the importance of a \"champion\" and staff buy-in, the necessity of multiple levels of community and agency support and collaboration, the ability to streamline staff training, the need for a clear chain of command, the need to develop program specific strategies, and the requirement for sufficient funding. An examination of costs indicated that some staff time may not be adequately reimbursed by funding sources for activities such as adapting the intervention, start-up training, ongoing supervision and quality assurance, and overhead costs.

The paper presents a method for territorial impact assessment and the results of applying this method on Slovenian energy policy. A two phase approach first disaggregates the problem into a three-dimensional matrix, consisting of policy measures, territorial objectives and territorial units. The synthesis phase aggregates measures and objectives in physical, economic or socio-cultural groups and observes their interrelation through an input-output matrix. The results have shown that such a two level approach is required to obtain complete and useful information for policy developers. In contrast to the relatively favourable evaluation of individual measures on the first level of assessment, the synthesis has revealed substantial and systemic weaknesses: considerable imbalance of energy policy favouring territorial effectiveness and mainly neglecting territorial identity as well as its counterproductiveness in reducing regional disparities.

The structure of the local learning collaborative requires careful attention to old relationships and challenges local governmental leaders to help move participants from a competitive to collaborative environment. This study describes one county's experience applying the NIATx process improvement model via a local learning collaborative. Local substance abuse and mental health agencies participated in two local learning collaboratives designed to improve client retention in substance abuse treatment and client access to mental health services. Results of changes implemented at the provider level on access and retention are outlined. The process of implementing evidence-based practices by using the Plan-Do-Study-Act rapid-cycle change is a powerful combination for change at the local level. Key lessons include: creating a clear plan and shared vision, recognizing that one size does not fit all, using data can help fuel participant engagement, a long collaborative may benefit from breaking it into smaller segments, and paying providers to offset costs of participation enhances their engagement. The experience gained in Onondaga County, New York, offers insights that serve as a foundation for using the local learning collaborative in other community-based organizations.

Societal estrangement is often associated with substance use, particularly among this population. The current study sought to identify four domains of social estrangement (disaffiliation, human capital, identification with homeless culture, and psychological dysfunction) in relation to alcohol and drug addiction. Homeless young adults were recruited from three disparate urban areas: Los Angeles, CA (n\u00c2 =\u00c2 50), Austin, TX (n\u00c2 =\u00c2 50) and St. Louis, MO (n\u00c2 =\u00c2 46) using comparable research methods and measurement instruments. Findings demonstrated that variables measuring psychological dysfunction and homeless culture predicted alcohol addiction, while institutional disaffiliation and homeless culture predicted drug addiction. Findings affirm distinct patterns of estrangement related to alcohol compared to drug addiction. Understanding these features and the heterogeneity of this population has strong potential for assisting development of programs targeting substance use among this underserved population.

Among child factors, higher levels of internalizing behavior problems (Odds Ratio (O.R.)\u00c2 =\u00c2 3.60), externalizing behavior problems (O.R.\u00c2 history of neglect (O.R.\u00c2 =\u00c2 4.23) were associated with greater family support service use. Among caregiver factors, prior reports of maltreatment (O.R.\u00c2 =\u00c2 6.77), a mental primary caregivers' history of arrests (O.R.\u00c2 =\u00c2 6.47) and domestic violence (O.R.\u00c2 =\u00c2 2.87), were associated with heavy service use. Caseworkers' training on cultural issues (O.R.\u00c2 =\u00c2 61.35), their concerns over bureaucracy (O.R.\u00c2 =\u00c2 25.38) and concern over rules and regulations (O.R.\u00c2 =\u00c2 6.08) were also associated with greater service use among immigrant families. This research suggests that use of family support services may be determined not only by the family's demographic factors and risk level but also by caseworkers' training in cultural competence and their perception of organizational problems.

This longitudinal panel study investigates whether receipt of services from one or more helping professionals outside of the MMTP confers a benefit for drug treatment outcomes among a random sample of male MMTP patients (N\u00c2 =\u00c2 356). Each participant was interviewed 3 times, with 6 months between each interview. Since this observational study did not employ random assignment, propensity score matching was employed to strengthen causal validity of effect estimates. Results support hypotheses that receiving additional off-site services has significant beneficial effects in increasing the likelihood of abstaining from cocaine, heroin, and any illicit drug use over both the ensuing 6- and 12-month time periods. These findings indicate that receipt of additional medical and/or psychosocial services enhances the efficacy of methadone treatment in increasing abstinence from illicit drug use.

Awareness of the campaign, perceived credibility of the source, intentions to visit a promoted website, and intentions to perform the healthy behaviors were evaluated using mixed methods research. Results from a population level survey (n\u00c2 =\u00c2 1600) showed low unprompted and prompted awareness of the campaign and no differences in intentions or behaviors among those who were aware of the campaign. Unprompted recall resulted in a very wide range of responses including the citation of many commercial advertisers. Qualitative themes that emerged from the focus groups included neutral, positive, and negative comments about the advertisements, source credibility, website considerations specific to seniors, and suggestions about appropriate advertising for older adults. This research showed that the increased attention paid to the advertisements was due in a large part to negative reactions to the character used in the advertisements. Another important finding was the government was not considered to be a credible source of health information.

Effectiveness measures were the prevalence of at least one self-reported post-intervention mammogram and two post-intervention mammograms 6-15 months apart. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were the incremental cost per additional person screened. Uncertainty was examined with sensitivity analysis and bootstrap simulation.Results The targeted intervention cost $25 per person compared to $52 per person for the tailored intervention. About 27% of the cost was incurred in identifying and recruiting the eligible population. The percent of women reporting at least one mammogram were .447 in the control group, .469 in the targeted group, and .460 in the tailored group. The ICER was $1116 comparing the targeted group to the control group (95% confidence interval (CI)\u00c2 =\u00c2 $493 to dominated). The tailored intervention was dominated (more costly and less effective) by the targeted intervention.Conclusion Decision-makers should consider effectiveness evidence and the full recruitment and patient time costs associated with the implementation of screening interventions when making investments in mammography screening promotion programs. Identification and recruitment of eligible participants add substantial costs to outreach screening promotion interventions. Tailoring adds substantial cost to the targeted mammography promotion strategy without a commensurate increase in effectiveness. Although cost-effectiveness has been reported to be higher for some in-reach screening promotion interventions, a recent meta-analysis revealed significant heterogeneity in the effect sizes of published health-plan based intervention studies for repeat mammography (i.e., some studies reported null effects compared with control groups).

This article details the evaluation approach, which comprised these areas of the TOC: grantees' use of evidence-based interventions, cultural competency, quality improvement, community collaboration, and use of integrated care. Inductive analyses identified grantees' use of innovative practices, trauma-informed care, and use of validated instruments. In an iterative exercise spanning multiple years, the foundation and researchers found ways to gather information about community capacity and impact while simultaneously minimizing grantee data collection/reporting burden. Findings revealed that community agencies were improving in their uptake of evidence-based interventions and use of validated instruments. Community grantee use of trauma informed care also improved over the study period. Grantee desire to collaborate and coordinate services within the community was also strong. The research also revealed that in multiple domains (such as technology and non-profit operating costs) grantees needed support in building agency capacity. These findings shed light on which aspects of the foundation's TOC were being addressed through funding, and which areas of the community needed additional support.

The present study evaluates a local government sponsored dialogue on social identity and diversity aimed at promoting the civic integration of immigrant participants. Based on models for community dialogues across cultural differences and on the literature on immigrant civic integration, the researcher designed, implemented and evaluated the dialogue. The evaluation was based on an exit questionnaire completed by participants, observation notes taken by the researcher, and a follow-up interview with the program coordinator. The evaluation suggests that dialogues among newcomers about social identity and diversity that match most of the ideal conditions for positive intergroup contact stated in the literature likely facilitate immigrant civic integration. Participants reported improved feelings of mutual understanding and inclination to collaborate across cultural differences. The findings also indicate that participants developed a capacity to balance appreciation for cultural differences and group identities with proclivity to collaboration across cultural groups.

A Pre-test-Posttest intervention study was conducted at the National Population Council (NPC)-Giza governorate (GG) where all data were collected from all governmental organizations on an annual basis at the district level (19 districts), which include 28 indicators. Composite indices and indicators (n = 9) had been ranked and presented as a matrix that assigned districts into three situations: Best (green zone), prospective (yellow zone) and critical (red zone). Intervention: Presentation of the \"Districts' Enactment Matrix\" (DEM) for the year 2014 in GG -Regional Council for Population (RCP) quarterly meetings, headed by the governor and attended by representatives of all ministries. The feedback and recommendation for action taking by participants were reported by the researchers. Evaluation of the intervention was done by comparing DEM 2014 and DEM 2016. Results: At the governorate level, short-term strategies were used to improve the situation. All the districts in red zone 2014 and two districts in the yellow zone had demonstrated positive changes in their 28 indicators. Conclusion: The DEM model is a simple tool that facilitates communication between researchers and decision-makers that could be applied in different public health and population programs.

To address these challenges, we used SenseMaker\u00ae as a mixed methods M&E tool for GBV services and programs in Lebanon. Over a three-month period in 2018, a total of 198 self-interpreted stories were collected from women and girls accessing GBV programs from six service providers across five locations. The resultant mixed-methods analysis provided holistic and nuanced insights on how perceived benefits differed by type of GBV program, how motivations for accessing programs differed by location, and how feelings while accessing programs differed by participant nationality. SenseMaker reinforced the intersectionality between events leading up to the accessed services, the experiences of accessing the services, and subsequent outcomes as a result of having accessed the services, helping to contextualize the findings within the broader experiences of participating women and girls. Limited literacy and technology skills among participants proved to be a challenge and future work should investigate how technology might facilitate use of the tool among participants with lower literacy and technology skills in addition to exploring the feasibility and added value of SenseMaker as an M&E tool in acute humanitarian settings.

These structures call for bottom-up models of network evaluation and accountability instead of the current hierarchical arrangements where single schools are evaluated by a central agency. This paper builds on available research about network effectiveness to present evolving models of network evaluation. Network effectiveness can be defined as the achievement of positive network level outcomes that cannot be attained by individual organizational participants acting alone. Models of network evaluation need to take into account the relations between network members, the structure of the network, its processes and its internal mechanism to enforce norms in order to understand the achievement and outcomes of the network and how these may evolve over time. A range of suitable evaluation models are presented in this paper, as well as a tentative school inspection framework which is inspired by these models. The final section will present examples from Inspectorates of Education in Northern Ireland and Scotland who have developed newer inspection models to evaluate the effectiveness of a range of different networks.

The state health department provided a grant, guide, and training for health districts to implement the program and report quarterly and annually to the M&E. Some health districts did not meet this requirement. We also found that the M&E did not adequately capture the actual work of the districts in communities as related to the work plan. We identified several factors that negatively affected the performances of the M&E. For example, the state and health districts did not have a shared vision on how to develop and implement the program, and what to report to the M&E. We proposed strategies that could improve the timeliness and content of reports to the M&E, as well as its utilization in the future.

A documental collection, revision and analysis was performed in order to enhance our understandings of the impact of quality audit in terms of Governance and Management. The study focused on analysing the quality audit reports of 25 assessed Omani HEIs. It covered published reports of all private institutions who already completed the first stage of national accreditation process. From one side, the data analysis showed us that the majority of the Omani private higher education institutions operate their activities without having a clear strategic direction. Also, they don't have performant governance and management systems. From another side, a progress was observed in terms of institutional Affiliations for Programs and Quality Assurance, Student's grievance processes and Health and Safety management. Among other things, the findings revealed that the Omani HEIs perceive quality assessment programs as strategical imposed tool made under the constraint of accountability, rather than an effective mechanism of development.

Firstly, the aim was to explore if involving 39 local fifth-grade children (10-11 years old) from a deprived neighbourhood in creating playable installations in a public open space influenced their use of this space. Secondly, we wanted to explore if the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance framework (RE-AIM) was useful for evaluating different stages in the intervention project. RE-AIM was applied through a convergent mixed-methods triangulation design using survey, accelerometer, GPS, and interviews as data sources. Effectiveness outcomes revealed that on average the space was used less by the 39 children after the intervention. The implementation and maintenance dimensions revealed aspects of why most children involved in the project did not use the space after intervention. The evaluation cast light on children's perceptions of their role, and importance of maintenance when the intervention was completed. In future, all dimensions of built environmental projects would benefit from being planned and evaluated in a collaboration with all project partners using an evaluation framework integrated and applied from the beginning of the project.

The article aims to assess how rigorously the Korean field of disaster management research resources has been managed or how it can be improved for the ultimate goal of disaster management. Descriptive content analysis has been used as the major methodology by referring to the Johari window. In doing so, electronic research resources have been systematically compared with integrated research resources via the perspective of Korean-speaking researchers and that of English-speaking researchers. The conclusion is that two researchers have to be integrated with all four research resources (open, blind, hidden, and unknown resources) by implementing assigned responsibilities as well as freely asking questions. Ultimately, this will be conducive to reducing down the impacts of disaster in Korea.

It applies the evaluation framework developed in the EFFORTI project that recognizes the complexity of evaluating gender equality interventions in R&I, the importance of factoring in context to any sound evaluation as well as the need to distinguish between the design and implementation of interventions in evaluations. It is based on the analysis of 19 empirical case studies carried out throughout Europe and focuses on those structural and procedural factors that have either facilitated or hindered the implementation process of these interventions. Findings include how the governance framework; top-management commitment; bottom-up participation; framing synergies with other initiatives, strategies for tackling resistance; resources; sustainability of actions; gender competence, experience and knowledge and transparency, targets, standards and monitoring; and accessible data and information all contributed to the successful implementation of the interventions.

Since the programs' inception, assessments of the SBIR/STTR programs at several federal agencies have utilized surveys of former grantees as the primary source of data. Response rates have typically been low, making non-response bias a potential threat to the validity of some of these studies' results. Meanwhile, the availability of large publicly-available datasets continues to grow and methods of text mining and linking databases continue to improve. By linking NIGMS grant funding records, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office data, and business intelligence databases, we explored innovation, commercialization and survival for recipients of NIGMS SBIR/STTR funding. In doing so, we were able to more completely assess several key outcomes of the NIGMS SBIR/STTR program. Our evaluation demonstrated that the NIGMS program performed above baseline expectations along all dimensions, and comparably to other federal agency SBIR/STTR grant programs. In addition, we show that the use of extant data increasingly is a viable, less expensive, and more reliable approach to gathering data for evaluation studies.

This study used qualitative methods to examine whether individual differences in autonomous motivation offers a useful framework for developing targeted intervention programs for African American women. Focus groups (k = 6) were conducted to examine how different levels of autonomous motivation for physical activity related to differences in physical activity barriers and facilitators among African American women (N = 31). Sessions were audiotaped, transcribed, and coded by independent raters (r = 0.70). QSR NVivo 11 was used to analyze data, and themes were identified separately for women with low, medium, or high autonomous motivation. Those with high autonomous motivation focused on themes of wanting novelty, excitement, and competition, whereas those with low autonomous motivation focused on themes of wanting instrumental support and financial incentives for increasing engagement in physical activity. Implications for developing physical activity intervention programs for African American women that are targeted toward differences in autonomous motivation are discussed.

However, selecting Information Technology (IT) projects is a difficult task due to the complexities and uncertainties inherent in the strategic-operational nature of the process, and the existence of both quantitative and qualitative criteria. We propose a two-stage process to select an optimal project portfolio with the aim of maximizing project benefits and minimizing project risks. We construct a two-stage hybrid mathematical programming model by integrating Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) with Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). This hybrid framework provides the ability to consider both the quantitative and qualitative criteria while considering budget constraints and project risks. We also present a real-world case study in the cybersecurity industry to exhibit the applicability and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method.

However, given current fiscal constraints faced by governmental agencies, a recent report from the Institute of Medicine and National Research Council highlighted the need for cost-benefit analyses to inform decision making by policymakers. Furthermore, performance management tools such as balanced scorecards and dashboards do not generally include cost-benefit analyses. In this paper, we describe the development of an Excel-based decision support tool that can be used to evaluate a selected family-based program for at-risk children and adolescents relative to a comparison program or the status quo. This tool incorporates the use of an efficient, user-friendly interface with results provided in concise tabular and graphical formats that may be interpreted without need for substantial training in economic evaluation. To illustrate, we present an application of this tool to evaluate use of Boys Town's In-Home Family Services (IHFS) relative to detention and out-of-home placement in New York City. Use of the decision support tool can help mitigate the need for programs to contract experts in economic evaluation, especially when there are financial or time constraints.

Early-stage interventions have innovative content necessitating evaluation; however existing evaluation frameworks omit constructs and guidelines relevant to this evaluation. Early-stage interventions require planning and evaluation that supports creating, testing, and exploring content to establish general feasibility and enable refinement for further testing, prior to randomised controlled trialling and wider dissemination. Feasibility, Reach-out, Acceptability, Maintenance, Efficacy, Implementation, Tailorability (FRAME-IT) was developed for a mixed methods feasibility study of a novel well-being intervention. FRAME-IT was conceived as a complementary framework to Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM; Glasgow et al., 1999) which is better suited for mid- and late- stage interventions. FRAME-IT is proposed to support: (1) early-stage intervention planning and design, by guiding research focus and data sourcing strategy with relevant constructs; (2) comprehensive evaluation, by including constructs appropriate for early-stage interventions, i.e. feasibility, acceptability, and tailorability; (3) future intervention scalability, by including and adapting some of RE-AIM's constructs to encourage a smoother translation of research into practice as interventions are scaled-up.

Utilizing a process analysis approaches, the PM&E data gathered through key informant interviews, formal surveys, and policy frameworks were analyzed. The study revealed three dominant power struggles between youth and programme implementers in three districts at the Greater Accra region, Ghana. The first and pervasive form of power dynamics involves the youth and programme implementers. The second involves a variety of arrangements with the government on one hand and implementers and youth on the other side. The third is who qualifies to be a beneficiary and for that matter participate in the PM&E. In these three forms of power struggles the paper reveals superior implementers control of who participate in the programme PM&E and at what stage in the process. The power imbalance between programme implementer and target beneficiaries impeded the level of beneficiaries' participation in the PM&E.

The paper focuses on how to improve academic output of a granted fund when the adding of new members changes principal investigator's network position. This objective is refined by exploring how new members affect the relationship between principal investigator's network position and the academic output of granted funds, and whether this effect is similar in high-output and low-output collaboration networks. New members are divided into two groups, namely, international collaboration and inbound mobility. Using negative binomial regression on research funds supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the results indicate that new members indeed have moderating effects on the relationship between principal investigator's network position and the academic output of granted funds. Moreover, we find that this moderating effect in high-output collaboration networks is larger than that in low-output collaboration networks. Our findings provide practical implications for the decision makers to design funding planning and for the principal investigators to improve academic output.

The present study aimed to explore patients' reasons for dropping out of psychotherapy in Kermanshah, Iran. The present qualitative study was performed using conventional content analysis. The current sample included 15 participants consisting of 7 patients who dropped out of psychotherapy and 8 psychotherapists who have previously experienced patient dropout. A semi-structured interview was used for data collection. All interviews were audio recorded and subsequently transcribed. Content analysis using constant comparisons was performed for transcribed interviews. Four main categories emerged as reasons for dropping out of psychotherapy: dissatisfaction with the quality of psychotherapy, financial problems in psychotherapy, unprepared socio-cultural context of psychotherapy, and psychotherapy as a non-user friendly treatment. Additionally, specific subcategories within each main category were documented. The results revealed distinct reasons for psychotherapy drop out in the current Iranian-based sample. These identified reasons should be considered and addressed at the onset of treatment as well as in the development of formal interventions aimed at reducing dropout. Further research investigating the antecedents leading to patient drop out is recommended.

While there is an active line of research assessing the impacts of such programs, little has been written about the process of successfully implementing them. As such, this paper uses a multisectoral nutrition-sensitive agriculture program implemented in four African countries as a case study to address key challenges in and lessons learned from implementation. We highlight the overall flexibility of nutrition-sensitive agriculture but also the need to adapt certain aspects to the particular context, as well as the opportunities for cross-context learning (and the limits to this). Integrating rigorous evaluation into such complex programs and forging diverse cross-sectoral partnerships offer both rewards and challenges, upon which we reflect. Main lessons learned from the program include the importance of carefully sequencing interventions, retaining flexibility in implementation, allowing for considerable time for cross-sector integration and coordination, and considering community impacts when designing research.

We provide an in-depth case study of tailoring a program for the residents of Berkshire County, Massachusetts. The formative research process includes collection and analysis of secondary data sources, extensive in-person interviews with community leaders, and in-depth focus groups with members of the population of interest. Findings from the formative research are then applied to tailoring the program materials and presentations and the training of the integrative team of health professionals that offer the program. Distinct components of program are tailored to the realities of the social, cultural, historical, and health and medical contexts in each community while other components of the program are tailored to individual participants. Overall, we believe this case study fully illustrates the utility of formative research in tailoring evidenced-based programs to increase program relevance and positive outcomes while maintaining fidelity to a program's learning objectives and evaluation. We hope this in-depth account with specific examples proves useful as a guide to others when designing and conducting formative research to tailor health and medical interventions to the audience.

Yet planning such multi-sectoral programs and designing appropriate evaluations, to respond to different disciplinary cultures of evidence, remain a challenge. We describe the context, program development process, and evaluation design of the Mama SASHA project (Sweetpotato Action for Security and Health in Africa) which promoted production and consumption of a bio-fortified, orange-fleshed sweetpotato (OFSP). In planning the program we drew upon information from needs assessments, stakeholder consultations, and a first round of the implementation evaluation of a pilot project. The multi-disciplinary team worked with partner organizations to develop a program theory of change and an impact pathway which identified aspects of the program that would be monitored and established evaluation methods. Responding to the growing demand for greater rigour in impact evaluations, we carried out quasi-experimental allocation by health facility catchment area, repeat village surveys for assessment of change in intervention and control areas, and longitudinal tracking of individual mother-child pairs. Mid-course corrections in program implementation were informed by program monitoring, regular feedback from implementers and partners' meetings. To assess economic efficiency and provide evidence for scaling we collected data on resources used and project expenses. Managing the multi-sectoral program and the mixed methods evaluation involved bargaining and trade-offs that were deemed essential to respond to the array of stakeholders, program funders and disciplines involved.

This lack was addressed by two large-scale surveys that were launched in the course of the EU-funded MoRRI project (Monitoring the evolution and benefits of RRI, Contract number RTD-B6-PP-00964-2013, Duration 09/2013-03/2018). The analysis shows that the institutional environment positively influences the degree of RRI activities and the general attitudes towards more responsible research and innovation: researchers working in an institutional environment that systematically supports the practice of RRI are more active in RRI practices than researchers who do not rely on such structures. For the gender equality dimension, this means that institutions with a gender equality plan (GEP) in place are more inclined to support female researchers than institutions without such institutional incentives. Furthermore, researchers with experiences in EU-funded projects are more likely to be engaged in RRI activities. Even if female researchers have a stronger inclination to engage with society than their male counterparts, gender competence proves to be the relevant distinguishing criterion. Gender competent researchers are more often involved in other RRI activities.

However, their effectiveness has been variable, and evaluation methods have been insufficient and inconsistent. Thus, we propose a mixed-methods evaluation framework and discuss pilot study findings. CHCs in our pilot study partnered with Purdue Extension. Extension links communities and land grant universities, providing programming and support for community-engaged research. We conducted social network analysis and effectiveness perception surveys in CHCs in 8 rural Indiana counties during summer 2017 and accessed county-level health statistics from 2015-16. We compared calculated variables (i.e., effectiveness survey k-means clusters, network measures, health status/outcomes) using Pearson's correlations. CHC members' positive perceptions of their leadership and functioning correlated with interconnectedness in their partnership networks, while more centralized partnership networks correlated with CHC members reporting problems in their coalitions. CHCs with highly rated leadership and functioning developed in counties with poor infant/maternal health and opioid outcomes. Likewise, CHCs reporting fewer problems for participation developed in counties with poor infant/maternal health, poor opioid outcomes, and more people without healthcare coverage. This pilot study provides a framework for iterative CHC evaluation.

Service planners remain unsure about how to implement such partnerships in maternity care, and there is a lack of appropriate tools designed to gauge the state of such partnerships for the Australian Indigenous context. In 2013, two Aboriginal health services and a major tertiary hospital partnered to deliver best practice maternity care to Indigenous families in Brisbane, Australia. A participatory action research approach underpinned this study. Semi-structured qualitative interviews and focus groups were conducted with 21 of the partnership staff. All interviewees emphasized the partnership's commitment to improving long-term health and wellbeing for Indigenous families. Strategic planners were more likely to report a positive partnership than staff involved in service delivery who had diverse views. This highlights the challenges of change management when conducting such a significant service redesign in this cross-cultural context. We detail changes made within the partnership in response to the findings and provide suggestions for future development of an evaluation tool to review the state of Aboriginal-Mainstream Partnerships.

Evidence from the Kaonafatso ya Dikgomo (KyD) Scheme in South Africa The objective of the study was to develop an index which circumvents the need for quantitative measures in evaluating Livestock Development Programmes (LDPs). This was done through a conceptual framework which integrates indexing and the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework (SLF) to attain qualitative benefits. The study utilised a cross-sectional survey of Kaonafatso ya Dikgomo (KyD) Scheme participants in KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape and Limpopo Provinces, South Africa, as a case. Data were collected through a questionnaire. Multiple sampling methods were used to identify 164 respondents. The results showed low benefits as exhibited by an index of 0.26. The Scheme showed highest benefits through social capital, followed by human, natural, financial and physical capital, respectively. The study concluded that concentrating on income proxies through conventional cost-benefit analysis (CBA) tends to mask the qualitative benefits exhibited by livestock improvement programmes. The theoretical lessons learnt included the exhibition and possibility of measuring qualitative benefits through indexing. Recommendations include further inquiry and refining the construction of the index to circumvent its subjectivity.

Yet, few participatory models for carrying out these aims exist. For this study, researchers utilized concept mapping (CM) to explicate a conceptual framework for planning, and subsequently evaluating, a wellness initiative at a multi-state social service organization. CM is a participatory approach that analyzes qualitative data via multi-dimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analyses. Outputs include a number of visual depictions that allow researchers to explore complex relationships among sets of the data. Results from this study indicated that participants (N=64), all of whom were employees of the agency, conceptualized organizational wellness via an eight-cluster solution, or Concept Map. Priority areas of this framework, specifically importance and feasibility, were also explored. After a brief review of pertinent literature, this article explicates the CM methodology utilized in this study, describes results, discusses lessons learned, and identifies apt areas for future research.

This strategic learning is based on the logic that S3 presents a new paradigm within the innovation policy scope that requires the inclusion of monitoring schemes that integrate the assessment of the dynamic process under which both public administration and other innovation stakeholders learn and improve their activities (within and without the strategy) thanks to the learning gathered throughout S3 (and its instruments and projects) implementation.

Accepted behavioral theory might increase understandings of those changes so program training architectures can be improved. As part of larger-scale longitudinal research, participants (N = 129; 64 % female, Mage = 14.6 years, SD = 0.6) were selected by senior camp administrators for a structured leadership training program that required in-person conferences, viewing training videos every 2 weeks, obtaining ongoing mentoring from senior camp staff, and attending several weeks of summer camp where further training was provided. Validated surveys of proposed dimensions of self-control and interpersonal functioning were administered twice over 6 months to assess training program-associated changes. There were significant improvements in total self-control, self-control specifically related to coping, and family-related functioning. Although no demographic factor was associated with score change, baseline score was a significant predictor across measures. After controlling for baseline scores, stepwise multiple regression analyses indicated that higher self-control scores (i.e., planful behavior, coping efficacy, affective thought management) significantly predicted improvements in general, family, and peer-related functioning. Theory-based relationships between changes in self-control and interpersonal functioning enabled the identification of training program areas that might be targeted for improvement.

Technology use and integration can help ease the burdens associated with program evaluation by reducing the resources needed (e.g., time, money, staff) and increasing evaluation efficiency. This paper reviews how program evaluators, across disciplines, can apply internet and mobile technologies to key aspects of program evaluation, which consist of participant registration, participant tracking and retention, process evaluation (e.g., fidelity, assignment completion), and outcome evaluation (e.g., behavior change, knowledge gain). In addition, the paper focuses on the ease of use, relative cost, and fit with populations. An examination on how these tools can be integrated to enhance data collection and program evaluation is discussed. Important limitations of and considerations for technology integration, including the level of technical skill, cost needed to integrate various technologies, data management strategies, and ethical considerations, are highlighted. Lastly, a case study of technology use in an evaluation conducted by the Clearinghouse for Military Family Readiness at Penn State is presented and illustrates how technology integration can enhance program evaluation.

However, there is paucity of information on practical insights and best practices that have helped implementing organisations to successfully embed VfM in practice for programming and evaluation. In this article, we discuss strengths and weaknesses of approaches that been used and insights on best practices to manage for, demonstrate, and compare VfM, using a health pooled fund programme implemented in conflict-affected South Sudan as case study supported by evidence reported in the literature while critiquing adequacy of the available approaches in this setting. An expanded and iterative process framework to guide VfM embedding for health programming and evaluation is then proposed. In doing so, this article provides a very relevant one-stop source for critical insight into how to embed VfM in practice. Uptake and scale-up of the proposed framework can be essential in improving VfM and aid effectiveness which will ultimately contribute to progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.

The two reviewers' assessments of photographs were in agreement. The assessment of emotional/behavioural display showed 82% agreement. Agreement between reviewers' judgements of proxemics (W = .866), interaction (W = .722), engagement (W = .932) and overall impression (W = .804) were all significant (p < .005).

Community mobilization is a potential strategy for reducing men's IPV perpetration, but this has rarely been examined globally. We conducted a mixed-methods process evaluation alongside a trial testing community mobilization in peri-urban South Africa. We used in-depth interviews (n=114), participant observation (160 h), and monitoring and evaluation data to assess program delivery. Qualitative data (verbatim transcripts and observation notes) were managed in Dedoose using thematic coding and quantitative data were descriptively analyzed using Stata13. We learned that outreach elements of community mobilization were implemented with high fidelity, but that critical reflection and local advocacy were difficult to achieve. The context of a peri-urban settlement (characterized by poor infrastructure, migrancy, low education, social marginalization, and high levels of violence) severely limited intervention delivery, as did lack of institutional support for staff and activist volunteers. That community mobilization was poorly implemented may explain null trial findings; in the larger trial, the intervention failed to measurably reduce men's IPV perpetration. Designing community mobilization for resource-constrained settings may require additional financial, infrastructural, organizational, or political support to effectively engage community members and reduce IPV.

Fifty-five percent (n = 69) of extension agents were selected to collect data through an electronic survey. Results indicated that extension agents in the Riyadh Region cited on job training as a main source for acquiring knowledge in OA. Agents expressed interest in receiving training in OA in general, OA marketing, and transitioning to OA. The most useful resources were field days at organic farms, OA training sessions at colleges, and attending OA trial plots. There were no differences in the level of interest in training; however, there were significant differences between individuals in terms of their experience in OA, job responsibility for providing information related to OA, and area of specialization in their job. This study recommends developing professional training programs based on the current knowledge of extension agents.

However, bottlenecks often hinder the attainment of objectives and the timely delivery of intervention packages leading to sub-optimal performance of health systems. Bottleneck identification, analysis and removal approaches to planning, which requires key stakeholders' participation, have been recommended to improve health system outcomes in LMICs. This study demonstrates how integration of participatory action research (PAR) within a quality improvement model can help navigate the complexities of health system bottleneck analyses, planning and performance improvement in a Nigerian sub-national context. Primary health care; Quality A key step in program evaluation and planning State tobacco prevention and control programs (TCPs) require a fully functioning infrastructure to respond effectively to the Surgeon General's call for accelerating the national reduction in tobacco use. The literature describes common elements of infrastructure; however, a lack of valid and reliable measures has made it difficult for program planners to monitor relevant infrastructure indicators and address observed deficiencies, or for evaluators to determine the association among infrastructure, program efforts, and program outcomes. The Component Model of Infrastructure (CMI) is a comprehensive, evidence-based framework that facilitates TCP program planning efforts to develop and maintain their infrastructure. Measures of CMI components were needed to evaluate the model's utility and predictive capability for assessing infrastructure. This paper describes the development of CMI measures and results of a pilot test with nine state TCP managers. Pilot test findings indicate that the tool has good face validity and is clear and easy to follow. The CMI tool yields data that can enhance public health efforts in a funding-constrained environment and provides insight into program sustainability. Ultimately, the CMI measurement tool could facilitate better evaluation and program planning across public health programs.

Despite a significant investment in SBIR/STTR and an interest in increasing geographic diversity in the institute's research portfolio, there has not been an assessment of the distribution of NIGMS's SBIR/STTR funding, outcomes associated with that investment, and relationships between the two. The geographic distribution of NIGMS' SBIR/STTR funding was highly concentrated in a small number of states, with a high correlation between each state's funding and its number of small scientific research and development businesses. Affiliation with a major research university was correlated with several measures of innovation and firm success. Our findings are consistent with earlier research showing that economic activity in research and development and research output tend to cluster in geographic regions where knowledge can be generated and shared more efficiently.

In the early stages of such a complex project, with multiple teams separated by geography and disciplines, the evaluation program has been integral in connecting internal and external stakeholders at the center and project levels. We used a developmental evaluation (DE) framework to respond to the complex political environment surrounding agricultural health and safety in the southeast; to engage external stakeholders in guiding the center's research and outreach trajectories; to support center research teams in a co-creation process to develop logic models and tailored indicators; and to provide timely and feedback within the center to address communications gaps identified by the evaluation program.

This is particularly problematic for programs aimed at veterans with mental health concerns, as evaluation typically focuses narrowly upon mental health symptom severity, even though program participants may have other health-related priorities. We analyzed responses to free-text questions on 237 surveys completed by veterans with mental health concerns enrolled in a yoga program at six VA clinics in Louisiana to characterize veteran participants' experiences with yoga. Qualitative analysis resulted in 15 domains reflecting veterans' individual health-related values and priorities. We use results to illustrate the potential for analysis of free-text responses to reveal valuable insights into patient experiences, demonstrating how these data can inform patient-centered program evaluation. The approach we present is more accessible to those responsible for decision-making about local programs than conventional methods of analyzing qualitive evaluation data.

Often, resources are limited and not every agency's interest can be represented in the final evaluation plan. The article illustrates how the Antecedent Target Measurement (ATM) approach to logic modeling was adapted to meet this challenge. The key adaptation is the context map generated in the first step of the ATM approach. The context map makes visually explicit many of the underlying conditions contributing to a problem as possible. The article also shares how a prioritization matrix can assist the evaluator in filtering through the context map to prioritize the outcomes to be included in the final evaluation plan as well as creating realistic outcomes. This transparent prioritization process can be especially helpful in managing evaluation expectations of multiple agencies with competing interests. Additional strategic planning benefits of the context map include pinpointing redundancies caused by overlapping collaborative efforts, identifying gaps in coverage, and assisting the coordination of multiple stakeholders.

Currently, evaluators have minimal guidance in navigating this essential professional competency, professed to be a necessary part of their practice.

The \"T\" concentrates on a practice-oriented form of (T)heorizing, which comes from analysis and serves as a basis for the resulting (A)ct. The last \"A\" focuses on the specifics of an action plan to change one's evaluation practice in light of the practical theory developed through theorizing.

Likewise, fathers' relationships with health and social services have also begun to be explored. Yet despite the problems fathers experience in interactions with healthcare services, few programs have been developed for them. To explain this, some authors point to the difficulty practitioners encounter in developing and structuring the theory of programs they are trying to create to promote and support father involvement (Savaya, R., & Waysman, M. (2005). Administration in Social Work, 29(2), 85), even when such theory is key to a program's effectiveness (Chen, H.-T. (2005). Practical program evaluation. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications). The objective of the present paper is to present a tool, the logic model, to bridge this gap and to equip practitioners for structuring program theory. This paper addresses two questions: (1) What would be a useful instrument for structuring the development of program theory in interventions for fathers? (2) How would the concepts of a father involvement program best be organized?

This exploratory study examined, through a program theory approach, the design and implementation of a small-scale, community-based fund in Ireland. Observations, documentary analysis, interviews and group discussions with 19 participants were utilized to develop a detailed understanding of the program mechanisms, activities and processes, as well as the experiences of key stakeholders engaged with the funding scheme and its implementation. The findings showed that there were positive perceptions of the scheme and its function within the community. Overall, the availability of funding was perceived by key stakeholders as being beneficial. However, there were concerns over the accessibility of the scheme for more marginalized members of the community, as well as dissatisfaction with the openness and transparency surrounding funding eligibility. Lessons for the implementation of small-scale CDD funds are elaborated and the utility of program theory approaches for evaluators and planners working with programs that fund community-based initiatives is outlined.

Several evidence-based programs have been developed to prevent adolescent substance use. Many of the most rigorously tested and empirically supported prevention programs were initially developed and tested in the United States. Increasingly, these interventions are being adopted for use in Europe and throughout the world. This paper reports on a large-scale comprehensive initiative designed to select, adapt, implement, and sustain an evidence-based drug abuse prevention program in Italy. As part of a large-scale regionally funded collaboration in the Lombardy region of Italy, we report on processes through which a team of stakeholders selected, translated and culturally adapted, planned, implemented and evaluated the Life Skills Training (LST) school-based drug abuse prevention program, an evidence-based intervention developed in the United States. We discuss several challenges and lessons learned and implications for prevention practitioners and researchers attempting to undertake similar international dissemination projects. We review several published conceptual models designed to promote the replication and widespread dissemination of effective programs, and discuss their strengths and limitations in the context of planning and implementing a complex, large-scale real-world dissemination effort. 2015 52 27 38 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149718915000282 Griffin, Kenneth W. Antichi, for now: A mixed-methods evaluation of a short-term housing support program for homeless families The use of short-term rental subsidy vouchers offers a new approach to addressing the housing needs of families facing homelessness. In Massachusetts, the Family Home pilot program placed homeless families in housing instead of shelter, providing two years of rental subsidy plus support services with the goal of enabling families to maintain market rate housing. This mixed-method case study complements staff and participant interview data with participant survey and administrative data to evaluate the implementation and short-term outcomes of Family Home in one region. Data point to improved family well-being in housing but also persistent barriers to achieving longer-term housing and economic stability. Of the families who had exited the program at the end of the study, one quarter were able to retain their housing at market rate, only 9% returned to shelter, and one in five moved in with families/friends. Lack of affordable housing in a high rental cost region and jobs that pay living wages were among the major reasons that families struggled to maintain housing. This research points to the need for integrating supportive services from the program's start, including targeted workforce development, to plan for the end of the short-term rental subsidy.

The goal of the Office Community Research and Engagement (OCRE) of the Puerto Rico Clinical and Translational Research Consortium (PRCTRC) is to establish a stable and sustainable translational research capacity. Early efforts toward achieving this goal included sponsoring two independent research training programs. A description of the implementation of the five step Success Case Method is presented. Results reveal that SCM would deem both trainings as highly successful, based upon the overall impact of a low number of success cases. However, a traditional summative evaluation would consider this disappointing. Strengths of SCM are discussed. It was concluded that the Success Case Method is a useful and valuable evaluative method for measuring the success of health promotion and public health training initiatives and provides sufficient information for decision-making processes.

However, evaluation instruments are often limited, for example to single student competencies or specific elements of the teaching process. The present paper provides a more comprehensive evaluation concept that contributes to sustainable improvement of competence-based teaching in higher education institutions. The evaluation concept considers competence research developments as well as the participatory evaluation approach. The evaluation concept consists of three stages. The first stage evaluates whether the competencies students are supposed to acquire within the curriculum (ideal situation) are well defined. The second stage evaluates the teaching process and the competencies students have actually acquired (real situation). The third stage evaluates concrete aspects of the teaching process. Additionally, an implementation strategy is introduced to support the transfer from the theoretical evaluation concept to practice. The evaluation concept and its implementation strategy are designed for internal evaluations in higher education and primarily address higher education institutions that have already developed and conducted a competence-based curriculum.

Examining whether a practitioner evaluation toolkit can promote instrumental use In large-scale, multi-site contexts, developing and disseminating practitioner-oriented evaluation toolkits are an increasingly common strategy for building evaluation capacity. Toolkits explain the evaluation process, present evaluation design choices, and offer step-by-step guidance to practitioners. To date, there has been limited research on whether such resources truly foster the successful design, implementation, and use of evaluation findings. In this paper, we describe a multi-site project in which we developed a practitioner evaluation toolkit and then studied the extent to which the toolkit and accompanying technical assistance was effective in promoting successful completion of local-level evaluations and fostering instrumental use of the findings (i.e., whether programs directly used their findings to improve practice, see Patton, 2008). Forensic nurse practitioners from six geographically dispersed service programs completed methodologically rigorous evaluations; furthermore, all six programs used the findings to create programmatic and community-level changes to improve local practice. Implications for evaluation capacity building are discussed.

A team of four researchers affiliated with the Center for Research on Educational and Community Services (CRECS) at the University of Ottawa conducted the evaluation. The purpose of the evaluation was to identify the supervision needs and challenges of coordinators and front line staff, assess the efficiency of the current supervision practices, and evaluate the supervisors' and supervisees' satisfaction with these current practices. A literature review was performed to help provide a clear definition of 'supervision' and the different professional roles it encompasses. Additionally, research evidence pertaining both to what contributes to supervision efficacy and supervisor competency was reviewed to distill the most robust findings in the existing literature. The lines of evidence consisted of a document and file review, an online employee survey, group discussions (i.e. focus groups), and interviews with key informants. The results of the evaluation helped the research team formulate recommendations to the agency for the development of enhanced supervision practices across its various service areas.

This paper attempted to achieve both goals through the use of intervention-oriented evaluation of a professional development program intended to diagnose and correct students' misconceptions of climate change. Data was gathered, monitored and analyzed in three stages of a time-series design: the baseline, treatment and follow-up stages. The evaluation itself was the 'intervention' such that the data was allowed to 'contaminate' the treatment. This was achieved through giving the teacher unimpeded access to the collected information and to introduce midcourse corrections as she saw fit to her instruction. Results showed a significant development in students' conceptual understanding only after the teacher's decision to use direct and explicit refutation of misconceptions. Due to the accessibility of feedback, it was possible to locate specifically at which point in the process that the intervention was most effective. The efficacy of the intervention was then measured through comparing the scores across the three research stages. The inclusion of a comparison group to the design is recommended for future studies.

Research demonstrates that such programs yield positive returns on investment and are replacing more expensive, less effective options. However, programs are unlikely to produce expected benefits when they are not well-matched to community needs, not sustained and do not reach sufficient reach and scale. We argue that achieving these benchmarks for successful implementation will require states and county governments to invest in data-driven decision infrastructure in order to respond in a rigorous and flexible way to shifting political and funding climates. We conceptualize this infrastructure as diagnostic capacity and evaluative capacity: Diagnostic capacity is defined as the process of selecting appropriate programing and evaluative capacity is defined as the ability to monitor and evaluate progress. Policy analyses of Washington State, Pennsylvania and Louisiana's program implementation successes are used to illustrate the benefits of diagnostic and evaluate capacity as a critical element of EBP 197 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149718915000609 Walker, Sarah Cusworth Bumbarger, Brian K.

There is a growing body of research on the diffusion of EBP in addiction treatment; however, less is known about individual state initiatives to implement EBPs among community providers. The current study aimed to evaluate the progress of an initiative of the Mississippi Department of Mental Health (MDMH) to increase the implementation of evidence-based substance abuse treatment practices by certified providers. In addition, the study examines potential barriers to implementing these practices. To accomplish this goal, we reported the findings of two surveys of Mississippi addiction professionals conducted in 2010 and in 2013.

Whilst its use has been widely reported in the area of social programmes, it is less applied in the field of energy and climate change policy evaluations. This paper reports a recent study that has evaluated the effectiveness of the national biofuel policy (NBP) for the transport sector in Malaysia by adapting a TBE approach. Three evaluation criteria were derived from the official goals of the NBP, those are (i) improve sustainability and environmental friendliness, (ii) reduce fossil fuel dependency, and (iii) enhance stakeholders' welfare. The policy theory underlying the NBP has been reconstructed through critical examination of the policy and regulatory documents followed by a rigorous appraisal of the causal link within the policy theory through the application of scientific knowledge. This study has identified several weaknesses in the policy framework that may engender the policy to be ineffective. Experiences with the use of a TBE approach for policy evaluations are also shared in this report.

The purpose of this study was to empirically explore faculty, student, and employers' perceptions of what should be included in a graduate level introductory course on program evaluation. The researchers used a mixed methods approach (survey and focus group) to build consensus on and articulate key elements of an introductory evaluation course, as well as the approximate amount of time that stakeholders feel should be invested in each topic area. The results suggested consistency among stakeholders, suggesting the topics covered could form the basis for an introductory course that is consistent across instructors, programs, and institutions.

This article presents the method that we used to evaluate a professional development MOOC for postdoctoral trainees that was created by a university consortium in the US. Most approaches to evaluating MOOCs focus on analysis of participation, outcomes from course assignments, self-reported learning outcomes, course completion and user pathways through the online content or clickstream data. Few published evaluations describe in detail how learning happens within online courses and the anticipated medium and longer term cognitive and behavioral outcomes on participants. This work aims to guide those who are designing, implementing and evaluating MOOCs through applying theories of change to focus evaluation on the process of learning. This approach can be used as a complement to traditional approaches for evaluating MOOCs. We described how we worked with the MOOC team building the content to develop a theory of change for each module (or lesson) within the MOOC and used the theory of change to guide evaluation of short and medium term participant cognitive, affective and attitudinal, and behavioral outcomes. Finally, we share lessons learned and suggestions for implementing theories of change in both the design and evaluation phases of MOOC development.

This study applies a content analysis to investigate the extent of voluntary Intellectual Capital disclosure (ICD) provided through performance reports by a sample of 59 Italian public universities. Four multivariate regression models are estimated to examine the associations between academic performance and the level of ICD and its sub-components, namely Human Capital, Structural Capital and Relational Capital. The content analysis findings show that Italian public universities place a high value on disclosing human capital information. The results based on the multivariate analysis confirm the view that, in the case of higher performance, Italian Public Universities tend to convey a greater extent of information on both IC and its sub-components. This study broadens the scope of mainstream ICD literature's actions by bringing new expertise about the interconnections between university performance and voluntary ICD provided via performance reports. Connecting university performance to ICD can enhance the practical and theoretical understanding of the role that ICD may exert for universities to signalling their excellence and explain to stakeholders how they create value and achieve superior performance, focusing on their strategic - IC-based resources. Intellectual Capital; University performance; Intellectual Capital and successes to the implementation of a zoo conservation-education program Zoo conservation-education programs have potential to address biodiversity loss, although evidence of their effectiveness to encourage social change is in its infancy. Moreover, how a program is implemented may influence program efficacy, yet there is little evidence of the factors that shape this process in zoos. Accordingly, through a process evaluation of Zoos Victoria's 'When Balloons Fly\" (WBF) conservation-education program against marine debris, we identified barriers and enablers to the implementation of the program which can be addressed to improve future initiatives. Between April-May 2018, 24 Zoos Victoria professionals completed an online survey focussed on identifying challenges and successes in implementing WBF. Four participants additionally completed a follow-up telephone interview. Themes were identified and organised according to the model of diffusion in service organisations (Greenhalgh, Robert, Macfarlane, Bate, & Kyriakidou, 2004). Our results illuminate that features of the organisation (e.g., structure, culture) rather than features of individuals (e.g., skills, motivation) or characteristics of the conservation-education program itself (e.g., messaging), were most influential to implementation success. Based on these findings, attention to the organisational context is critical for promoting and evaluating the success of conservation-education programs and must be given significant attention alongside program characteristics and staff capability to deliver them.

The 'Evidence to End FGM/C: Research to Help Girls and Women Thrive' programme created a research consortium that brought together African institutions and the world's leading and most experienced researchers in Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) abandonment. The priority countries for research were Burkina Faso, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, Somalia, and Sudan, given their stages of abandonment, the scale of the practice, and socio-cultural variations. Given the ambitious scope of the research component, the consortium outlined a theory of change (ToC). The ToC was designed to facilitate an exploration of the attendant complexities of researching a social practice underpinned with political and religious sensitivities and strong links to individual, family and community identity. Overall, we believe that efforts to encourage FGM/C abandonment would be more effective, more efficient and with greater value for money if a theory of change were used routinely to inform research, programming and evaluation design. This commentary contributes to this goal by documenting our experiences with using a theory of change in designing and implementing research to inform the uptake of research for the design and evaluation of FGM/C interventions. A substantial portfolio of robust evidence is now online. This evidence provides new knowledge, insights, methods, and tools that are valuable to diverse end-users such as researchers, programme implementers, the health, legal and education systems, governments, donors, and the media.

A scoping review was conducted to retrieve peer-reviewed original manifestations of politics in evaluation: An exploratory study across the evaluation process Evaluation has been described as a political act. Programs and policies are generated from a political process, and the decision to evaluate and how to use the evaluation are manifestations of the political dynamic. This exploratory study was conducted with practicing evaluators to understand what they view as political situations in the evaluation process and how they responded to these situations. Findings suggest that, in relation to the potential evaluation phases in which each respondent has been involved, evaluations are susceptible to politics when initially attempting to identify stakeholders and when it's time to report the evaluation findings. Evaluators have also developed multiple strategies for dealing with these situations, including finding allies for the evaluation and working to explain the evaluation process and its implications. We hope that this study will help to inform novice and expert evaluators about the various political situations they may encounter in their practice.

The Teens Opinions Count (TOC) project utilized the group concept mapping methodology to develop a framework for after school time program development for teens in 16 counties in the Southeast Michigan and Western New York regions. This extensive planning effort demonstrated a large-scale, geographical approach to the implementation of GCM, where multiple sites (in this case counties) simultaneously engaged in independent processes on the same topic, with the purpose of producing separate locale-specific conceptualizations. TOC was the largest GCM project ever conducted in terms of the number of participants and volume of data submitted. This report details GCM recruitment, data collection, data compilation, and analysis of ideas from over 20, 000 teens and 2, 000 adults. Although implementation was conducted at the county level, many of the separate county-level GCM processes were larger than what is typically encountered in the literature. Operationalizing GCM at such a scale required significant planning, design, communication, and data management solutions. The extensive data collection effort required the need for creative and innovative procedures to engage teens and process the sheer volume of data.

In recent years, articles in Evaluation and Program Planning have noted the importance of evaluating programs' unintended consequences, and the need to increase our knowledge in that area. To that end, this paper considers the information that can be obtained about the unintended consequences of foreign assistance programs through an automated textual analysis and review of publicly-available monitoring reports and evaluations. Automated full text searches for terms synonymous with 'unintended consequences' were conducted of more than 1, 300 monitoring reports and evaluations downloaded from a publicly-available database of foreign assistance programs. The reports identified by the automated searches were screened and analyzed to determine which had considered and/or reported about such consequences. Positive and negative consequences were identified, as were the assistance sectors and recipient countries. While this study makes available more information on the unintended consequences of foreign assistance programs, it also emphasizes the need for greater research in this area, and outlines how a future research project of this nature might obtain more data.

Through interviews with 43 unsheltered homeless individuals in the borough of Manhattan (age range 21-74 years), this qualitative study examined barriers they face in accessing housing and other services as well as experiences surviving on the street. Through thematic analysis of the interview data, the most common barriers found were obtaining required identification documents, lack of accessibility of shelters amid complex healthcare needs, waiting as part of the process, and exclusion of pets from shelters and housing options. Themes capturing survival on the street included sleeping safe, avoiding shelters, and meeting daily needs. Virtually all barriers street homeless New Yorkers face stem from bureaucratic policies that, however well-intentioned, do not address their diverse needs. Thus, long delays and poor communication, combined with crowded, unsafe shelters, lead to frustration and alienation. While homelessness is ultimately the result of a severe and chronic shortage of affordable housing, creating accessible, safe, pet-friendly shelter and safe haven options and instituting a smoother, more transparent process for moving from the streets could substantially reduce street homelessness.

The matched and unmatched samples (e.g., all unique surveys across all time periods) included 10, 135 surveys. Eighty-eight percent of these surveys were matched into the final longitudinal dataset. Findings suggest that students with certain characteristics were more likely to be matched over time (i.e., students who participated in student government, Latino/a students, and Asian students). In addition, students who did not comply with RCT protocol were less likely to be matched. Student history of victimization or perpetration of sexual violence was not associated with being matched over time. This study provides recommendations for preventing matching problems in longitudinal studies, a process for rectifying matching issues and a critique of studies that do not address issues of matching-related sample bias in their final analytic sample.

Following substance abuse treatment, individuals that were assigned to an OH condition (n=68) were compared to individuals assigned to a usual care condition (n=61). Economic cost measures were derived from length of stay at an Oxford House residence, and derived from self-reported measures of inpatient and outpatient treatment utilization. Economic benefit measures were derived from self-reported information on monthly income, days participating in illegal activities, binary responses of alcohol and drug use, and incarceration. Results suggest that OH compared quite favorably to usual care: the net benefit of an OH stay was estimated to be roughly $29, 000 per person on average. Bootstrapped standard errors suggested that the net benefit was statistically significant. Costs were incrementally higher under OH, but the benefits in terms of reduced illegal activity, incarceration and substance use substantially outweighed the costs. The positive net benefit for Oxford House is primarily driven by a large difference in illegal activity between OH and usual care participants. Using sensitivity analyses, under more conservative assumptions we still arrived at a net benefit favorable to OH of $17, 830 per person.

This article illustrates a way in which these evidence-based outcomes may be used not only to improve clinical decisions, but also managerial and policy strategies. To that end, the quality of life of 11, 624 social service recipients was assessed by means of the application of the GENCAT Scale, a questionnaire to assess quality of life according to the eight-domain model (Schalock & Verdugo, 2002).

Online evidence-based program registers (EBPRs) have been developed to address this need. However, the methods by which these registers determine programs and practices as being \"evidence-based\" has not been investigated in detail. This paper examines the evidentiary criteria EBPRs use to rate programs and the implications for how different registers rate the same programs. Although the registers tend to employ a standard Campbellian hierarchy of evidence to assess evaluation results, there is also considerable disagreement among the registers about what constitutes an adequate research design and sufficient data for designating a program as evidence-based. Additionally, differences exist in how registers report findings of \"no effect, \" which may deprive users of important information. Of all programs on the 15 registers that rate individual programs, 79% appear on only one register.

The objective of the study was to gather qualitative insights from CDP planners to inform effective CDP implementation. Ten semi-structured interviews with program planners were conducted via telephone (response rate of 58.8%). Condom distribution channels included site-based distribution (n = 6), web-based distribution (n = 4), and distribution via Uber (n = 1). Site-based distribution programs had distribution networks ranging from 100 to 3500 sites in a given jurisdiction. Planners of site-based CDPs experienced challenges with ensuring quality control at sites and supplying condoms to sites. Web-based CDPs allow individuals to order free condoms online. These CDP planners reported growing demand for this discreet service, particularly among young people. Web-based CDPs leveraged e-mail surveys to collect data on sexual behavior and behavior change, yielding response rates as high as 63%. All CDPs emphasized the importance of supplying a variety of products. Total supplies distributed (male condoms, internal condoms, lubricant sachets) ranged from 16, 000 to 45 million per year. Novel channels of distribution should be explored to ensure reach to adolescents and young adults.

To promote appropriate complementary feeding of young children, an economic development (ED) program involving income-generating asset transfer was implemented alongside a social and behavior change (SBC) program. This paper introduces a collaborative monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system in which diverse collaborators (\"research group\", \"implementation team\", and \"coordinators\") facilitate M&E data acquisition by leveraging their comparative advantages. The implementation team built a monitoring system to track the ED (n = 2960) and SBC participants (n=10, 000) over 12 months. Based on the baseline design and the monitoring records, the collaborators planned an impact evaluation introducing a quasi-experimental design using two cross-sectional surveys and a prospective cohort survey of child feeding and nutritional status. Using various data sources generated from the M&E system, the collaborators will also reveal the program impact pathway through which each intervention component is delivered, received, and utilized alongside the context-specific facilitators and barriers, including the programs' uptake. The collaborative M&E system enables the sharing of program goals, strengthens collaborators' commitment to the program, and extends the understanding of the program's progress and evaluation activities.

The rising incidence and global predictions are alarming since a HF is a major, and potentially fatal, trauma to the citizen, requiring acute surgery, a multimodal approach and post-operative crosssectoral rehabilitation. However, continuity of the rehabilitation program is frequently interrupted in the transition between sectors, compromising optimal recovery of frail citizens. Thus, there is a need to develop and implement optimized cross-sectoral rehabilitation after HF. The purpose of this explorative study was to develop, implement and evaluate an optimized cross-sectoral rehabilitation program (OCRP) after HF surgery using validated theoretical frameworks. OCRP was developed, implemented and evaluated in one municipality using a pragmatic user-centered approach, quantitative and qualitative data collection and theoretical frameworks including the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW) and RE-AIM. Results of OCRP showed optimized rehabilitation based on motivated health professionals, high patient satisfaction and tendencies of improved levels of physical function. No re-referrals to rehabilitation were reported after OCRP. The BCW, RE-AIM and user-centered approach to program development, implementation and evaluation are useful to apply in program development and evaluation processes across sectors, professions, and medical specialties.

However, the limited availability of social and fiscal resources requires an analysis of the relationship between a program's effectiveness and its costs. Outcome costs associated with a sample of 105 participants discharged for more than 1 year - and grouped by completion status - were compared to an eligible sample not enrolled (n=45). Transactional costs analysis (TCA) was used to calculate outcomes associated with treatment, arrest, and confinement in the 12-month post-MHC. Total outcome costs for the Successful Group ($16, 964) significantly differed from the Unsuccessful ($32, 258) and Compare Groups ($39, 870). Costs associated with the higher number of arrests for those in the Compare Group created the largest differences. Total cost savings between Successful and Compare (M=$22, 906) equated to $916, 240 and savings between Unsuccessful and Compare (M=$7612) were $494, 708. The total combined cost savings for participants in the 12-month post-MHC period was $1, 411, 020. While it is important to understand that MHCs and the individuals that they serve vary and these results are for a felony-level court, policy makers and researchers can use these results to guide their decision-making.

These prime issues in the conceptualization of SOCs are addressed, drawing on ecological theory to underscore the need for broader systems - including factors in the proximal and distal contexts of children and families - to be engaged in the process of promoting well-being and helping children and families function and participate fully in their communities.

There is growing interest in understanding the contribution of children and youth to socially valued reproductive activity within immigrant households in the United States. Ethnographic studies reveal that children and adolescents in immigrant families have significant responsibilities related to daily life and family functioning. This article focuses on the practice of sibling caretaking, in which older children supervise and socialize younger children, according to culturally informed family roles, responsibilities, and obligations. The purpose of this review is twofold: (1) to familiarize practitioners and evaluators with this cross-cultural practice; and (2) to discuss the implications of sibling caretaking with regard to the identification of familial risk and protective factors associated with migration and acculturation, and factors that inform culturally sensitive assessments, interventions, and evaluations related to family functioning and social support.

Although much has been published about program models and their successes, little detail is available to policy makers and community stakeholders on the resources required to start and implement a jail diversion program and which agencies bear how much of the burden. The current study used data on a model jail diversion program in San Antonio, Texas, to address this research gap. Data on staff costs, client contacts, planning, and implementation were collected for three types of diversion: pre-booking police, post-booking bond, and post-booking docket. An activity-based costing algorithm was developed to which parameter values were applied. The start-up cost for the program was $556, 638.69. Pre-booking diversion cost $370 per person; 90% of costs were incurred by community mental health agencies for short-term monitoring and screening (>80% of activities). Post-booking bond and docket diversion cost $238 and $205 per person, respectively; the majority of costs were incurred by the courts for court decisions. Developing a multiple-intercept jail diversion program requires significant up-front investment. The share of costs varies greatly depending on the type of diversion.

A cost-effectiveness analysis Oral health training is often introduced into community-based residential settings to improve the oral health of people with intellectual disabilities (ID). There is a lack of appropriate evaluation of such programs, leading to difficulty in deciding how best to allocate scarce resources to achieve maximum effect. This article reports an economic analysis of one such oral health program, undertaken as part of a cluster randomized controlled trial. Firstly, we report a cost-effectiveness analysis of training care-staff compared to no training, using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Effectiveness was measured as change in knowledge, reported behaviors, attitude and self-efficacy, using validated scales (K&BAS). Secondly, we costed training as it was scaled up to include all staff within the service provider in question. Data were collected in Dublin, Ireland in 2009. It cost between \u20ac7000 and \u20ac10, 000 more to achieve modest improvement in K&BAS scores among a subsample of 162 care-staff, in comparison to doing nothing. Considering scaled up first round training, it cost between \u20ac58, 000 and \u20ac64, 000 to train the whole population of staff, from a combined dental and disability service perspective. Less than \u20ac15, 000-\u20ac20, 000 of this was additional to the cost of doing nothing (incremental cost). From a dental perspective, a further, second training cycle including all staff would cost between \u20ac561 and \u20ac3484 (capital costs) and \u20ac5815 (operating costs) on a two yearly basis. This study indicates that the program was a cost-effective means of improving self-reported measures and possibly oral health, relative to doing nothing. This was mainly due to low cost, rather than the large effect. In this instance, the use of cost effectiveness analysis has produced evidence, which may be more useful to decision makers than that arising from traditional methods of evaluation. There is a need for CEAs of effective interventions to allow comparison between programs. Suggestions to reduce cost are presented.

We estimate and compare the cost of developing an i-Pad based tailored interactive multimedia intervention (TIMI) and a print based (Photonovella) intervention to increase human papillomavirus (HPV) immunization. The development costs of the interventions were calculated using a societal perspective. Direct cost included the cost of planning the study, conducting focus groups, and developing the intervention materials by the research staff. Costs also included the amount paid to the vendors who produced the TIMI and Photonovella. Micro cost data on the staff time and materials were recorded in logs for tracking personnel time, meeting time, supplies and software purchases. The costs were adjusted for inflation and reported in 2015 USD. The total cost of developing the Photonovella was $66, 468 and the cost of developing the TIMI was $135, 978. The amortized annual cost for the interventions calculated at a 3% discount rate and over a 7-year period was $10, 669 per year for the Photonovella and $21, 825 per year for the TIMI intervention.

To this end, funders might use multi-site evaluation (MSE) approaches to examine the impact of their collective investments. However, it is important to recognize that each program\u2014and its own program evaluation\u2014must be tailored to its setting, population, and local context to best meet the needs of its target population. Therefore, multi-site evaluations need to account for this complexity. This paper describes the S\u00ed Texas project, a large initiative of eight grantees implementing different integrated behavioral health models to improve physical and mental health outcomes along the Texas-Mexico border. With over 4, 200 MSE study participants, the evaluation for S\u00ed Texas used a partnership-centered approach to both enhance the evidence base and build local organizational capacity. This paper describes this approach, the process of tailoring evaluation practices to the grantees' context, and the challenge of balancing consistency at the grantee-level for the portfolio multi-site evaluation.

Using Data Envelopment Analysis, we obtain the efficiency levels and the targets that the input and outputs have to reach to be efficient in the provision of the police service. Next, and based on the literature, the effect of the following environmental variables is verified: young population, number of foreigners, unemployment, municipal per capita income, tourist level of the municipality, and ideology and political strength of the municipal government. Findings show that an increase in the number of young people in the municipality means an improved efficiency in the local police service. In contrast, cultural diversity (measured by the percentage of foreigners in the total population), unemployment, the mayor's ideology and political fragmentation of government do not have a significant effect on the level of efficiency. On the other hand, higher municipal per capita income means less efficiency, while an increase in tourism activity is related to the improvement of this.

Design and evaluation of a teacher-training program The article exposes the process of design and implementation of a training program for teachers that teach people with Visual Functional Diversity (VFD), taking into account their needs both in training and in the provision of resources in Nicaragua. To verify the effectiveness of the program, a quasi-experimental design was carried out with a non-equivalent pretest and posttest control group. The experimental group received training while the control group did not receive training. The evaluation of the results obtained after the application of the program was carried out through two instruments: an efficacy questionnaire and a satisfaction questionnaire.

This seems surprising as experienced planners and evaluators are well aware that unintended consequences frequently occur. Most evaluation designs are intended to determine whether there is credible evidence (statistical, theory-based or narrative) that programs have achieved their intended objectives and the logic of many evaluation designs, even those that are considered the most \"rigorous, \" does not permit the identification of outcomes that were not specified in the program design. We take the example of RCTs as they are considered by many to be the most rigorous evaluation designs. We present a numbers of cases to illustrate how infusing RCTs with a mixed-methods approach (sometimes called an \"RCT+\" design) can strengthen the credibility of these designs and can also capture important unintended consequences. We provide a Mixed Methods Evaluation Framework that identifies 9 ways in which UCs can occur, and we apply this framework to two of the case studies.

The purpose of this study is to identify the reasons for unplanned adaptations during implementation of an evidence-based sexual health education program in California. Evaluators reviewed fidelity checklists from the implementation of 571 cohorts for activities with reported unplanned adaptations. Reasons were qualitatively coded and compared across two phases of implementation and by setting. Educators reported 319 unplanned adaptations, affecting 21.5% of the 571 cohorts and 2.9% of 13, 782 activities. The most common reasons for unplanned adaptations were due to time management issues, site logistic issues, and to increase participant engagement. Over time, health educators reported fewer unplanned adaptations, particularly those due to time management, resulting in a decrease in the cohorts and activities affected. Adaptations to evidence-based curricula are necessary and often occur during implementation to fit local conditions and populations. Ongoing review of adaptation data provides an opportunity to refine training and technical assistance efforts. Guidance about the types of permitted adaptations and how to anticipate and plan for adaptations for future implementation can ensure fidelity to the core curriculum components and responsiveness to youth participants. Sex education; Adolescent; article An assessment scale of ECB: Perspectives from the faculty and staff of technical colleges in Taiwan Faculty and staff in Taiwanese technical colleges are required to perform school self-evaluations. Most members of technical colleges come from postsecondary schools and are thus unfamiliar with school self-evaluation procedures. An effective school self-evaluation involves a complete ECB, 1 making it necessary to build faculty and staff evaluation capacity. In this research, we analyzed previous studies, interviewed experts, conducted expert reviews, constructed an ECB assessment scale, and collected the opinions of 1054 faculty and staff, to confirm the validity of the proposed assessment scale. This scale included 21 items summarized in four dimensions: understanding the evaluation guidelines, familiarizing with evaluation requirements, participating in the evaluation activity, and implementing the evaluation connotation. We explain the four dimensions behind the ECB model, and propose three lessons learned from it.

Alongside companies, universities engage in a collaborative exploration for a shared knowledge base that does not pursue immediate exploitation. Drawing on research evaluation and the regional and entrepreneurial studies on University-Industry Collaborations (UICs) and knowledge ecosystems, this article assesses the digital training partnerships the University of Naples in Italy has established with some global technology and advanced manufacturing companies. By examining their innovative performance, the case study evaluation explores university-business 'productive interactions, ' highlighting such critical issues as the management and risks of co-innovation, the attraction of talents, and the development of human capital in a peripheral and moderate innovative region. The article critically discusses the regional development outcomes and the evaluation designs to assess the societal impact of university research and education. Productive interactions; Social impact pathways; University-industry collaborations (UICs); Knowledge ambiguities of performance-based governance reforms in Italy: Reviving the fortunes of evaluation and performance measurement Over the past two decades, Italy's administrative reforms have institutionalized evaluation to improve program effectiveness, staff productivity, and results-driven accountability against waste and corruption. Across ministries, regional governments, universities, schools and environmental protection agencies, seemingly unexpected consequences have emerged out of the implementation of performance measurement and evaluation regimes within public organizations. Formal compliance to legally binding evaluation procedures, judicially-sanctioned managerial accountability and lack of cross-agency coordination coupled with long-standing cultural separations among evaluators are some of the ambiguities associated with a performance-based governance system within Italian public administration. Building upon the 'new governane theory, ' and qualitative fieldwork, I explore the political consequences of evaluation and performance measurement for possible improvements. From a normative perspective, greater integration between program evaluation and performance measurement can support organizational learning and democratic accountability both at the central and local level.

The literature lacked empirical evidence on the cost efficiency of voluntary work in the public-sector context. Most previous studies have paid attention to the cases of nonprofit organizations, although there have been many volunteer programs in public organizations. In this research, we focused on the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary Boat Crew Program which may help distressed boaters in distress, patrol regattas and marine events, and assist in maritime observations. We discovered that approximately $1.39 million was invested in volunteers to run the boat crew program for 2019. We also estimated the total monetary benefit of volunteer contributions by using the replacement cost method. As a result, we found that 5369 volunteers contributed approximately 199, 000 h to the boat crew program in 2019. It means that the program extended the equivalent of 104 full-time Coast Guard personnel in 2019. The total economic benefit attributed to the volunteer contributions of labor ranged from $4.8 million to $5.4 million. Therefore, for every dollar the Coast Guard invested in the volunteer program, they obtained an additional return of $3.42 to $3.89 from volunteer contributions.

Regional Ryan White Planning Councils (RWPC) are responsible for setting priorities and deciding CARE Act fund allocations, using local data to identify greatest need. However, RWPC are challenged with interpreting complex epidemiological, service utilization, and community needs data to inform priority setting and resource allocations. We piloted system dynamics (SD) learning, using a validated HIV care continuum SD simulation model calibrated to one northeastern U.S. Ryan White funding area. The pilot applied systems thinking to understand the complex HIV care continuum and to simulate and compare outcomes of various resource allocation decisions. Three scripted workshops provided opportunities to learn the SD modeling process and simulation tool, simulate various resource allocations, and compare population health outcomes. Mixed methods evaluation documented the SD modeling process, member responses to the modeling sessions, and attitudes regarding benefits and limitations of SD modeling for RWPC decision-making. Despite high member turnover and complexity of the SD model, members could understand the simulation model and propose strategies to seek greatest improvements in HIV care retention, viral suppression, and reduced infections.

Evaluation; Evaluation quality; Evaluation use; Evaluation decision-making method for planning exhibitions in arts organizations: A case study of CaixaForum Barcelona Museum directors play a fundamental role in the management of arts institutions, and they need to constantly adapt to the changes and requirements of the society. Questions have been raised about how decisions are made in museums, and if any specific method exists to analyze and select exhibitions for a complete annual program. Interviews conducted with several directors and experts have confirmed that, in general, the decision-making process within cultural institutions is intuitive and based on the experience and subjectivity of the director, who has an artistic background but sometimes lacks experience in arts management. In order to address this subject, this study applied the Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) to CaixaForum Barcelona, an important cultural institution in Spain, and analyzed the decision-making process followed while selecting artists and topics for a temporary exhibition. This research contributes to a new decision-making method and the improvement of exhibition scheduling in arts organizations.

E-governance is the most widely used term for the result of this digital transformation in view of the changing nature of politics. This special issue zooms into digitalised public services by discussing practices and challenges in their provision, usage and evaluation. In doing so, it highlights interaction of e-governance (relationship among citizens, government, public and private actors notably in the context of digitalisation and innovation) and e-government (public services enabled by ICT). Contributions to the special issue identify challenges and pitfalls in implementing and evaluating e-governance by analysing different policy areas and geographical regions. The findings of the contributions suggest that factors of e-governance performance that potentially serve as evaluation criteria tend to be (overly) sensitive to context, i.e. policy area, systemic constellations, institutional settings, and administrative traditions in question. Consequently, attempts to evaluate e-governance, at least based on the empirical insight demonstrated in this special issue, remain limited to specific tools, instruments and contexts through which e-governance is operationalised and delivered (e.g., websites, projects and policy initiatives).

A set of practices derived from the matrix, together with pertinent adult learning approaches and driving instruction research formed the basis of an evaluation checklist developed to review the Keys2drive program (a national single-session interactive education program for learner drivers in Australia). The checklist criteria consisted of 18 practices, including: having a sound theoretical base; reflecting various GDE components; facilitating parental involvement; provision of building resilience; use of coaching approaches; commentary driving; self-assessment; understanding of risk factors; and supporting safe vehicle choices and graduated licensing schemes. The program review sought to determine the extent to which Keys2drive is aligned with best practice according to the checklist criteria. Evaluations of driver education programs should recognize that novice drivers, in discussions with their instructors/supervisors, may have differing interpretations and values concerning various GDE goals, such as their awareness of critical risk factors. As a best practice, instructors should be prepared to ask the novice 'How?' and 'Why?' questions relevant to their GDE goal interpretations and values.

Particularly, African American women are more likely to be infected with HIV from heterosexual sex. Yet, much of the intervention research has focused on men who have sex with men. This article describes the development and feasibility study of a six-session socio-behavioral health intervention that utilized sociodrama to reduce substance use and HIV/STI risk among heterosexual, African American men and women who have multiple sex partners. The intervention was developed based on theories and models of critical consciousness, social scripts, and group work practice. Content and delivery were informed by qualitative data collection with a range of stakeholders including service providers and members of the target population. The resulting intervention was six group sessions, delivered by two licensed social workers, with one of the facilitators trained in sociodrama. The results of the qualitative study explored the feasibility of conducting this six-week intervention and evaluated a trial run of the intervention. The data was obtained through focus group interviews and observations. Findings revealed that the intervention could be delivered with fidelity and was acceptable to participants and indicated that the intervention's innovative components of sociodrama and critical consciousness resonated with the participants and has potential to reduce HIV/STI risk and substance use. Reported barriers and suggested revisions need to be examined further and addressed to develop and implement a sustainable program that can be delivered in community-based settings. A future randomized control trial of the revised intervention will evaluate the intervention's efficacy.

A consortium was formed to assist Native Hawaiian and Pilipino women addressing abuse and strengthening support from the community. A quasi-experimental community-based participatory research study was designed to assess a community \"talkstory\" intervention for IPV. \"Talkstory\" refers to informal gatherings considered to be a laid-back conversation involving a \"reciprocal exchange of thoughts, ideas, feelings about self, and other issues\" (Affonso et al., 1996. Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, & Neonatal Nursing, 25, 738). This article describes the development of an intervention to address IPV in Hawaii and presents the findings obtained from the pilot studies. Results from the pilot study were used to modify the proposed \"talkstory\" intervention, revise the data collection tools, and provide the program developers with insights into how the community viewed IPV. The most significant change was an increased perception of their awareness, knowledge, and confidence to address IPV following the intervention.

Gender, the socially constructed roles and activities deemed appropriate for men and women, is an important factor in women's physical inactivity. To better understand how gender influences participation in leisure-time physical activity, a gender analysis was conducted using sex-disaggregated data from a county-wide health assessment phone survey and a qualitative analysis of focus group transcripts. From this gender analysis, several gender-based constraints emerged, including women's roles as caregivers, which left little time or energy for physical activity, women's leisure time activities and hobbies, which were less active than men's hobbies, and expectations for women's appearance that made them uncomfortable sweating in front of strangers. Gender-based opportunities included women's enjoyment of activity as a social connection, less rigid gender roles for younger women, and a sense of responsibility to set a good example for their families. The gender analysis was used to gain a deeper understanding of gender-based constraints and opportunities related to physical activity. This understanding is being used in the next step of our research to develop a gender-specific intervention to promote physical activity in women that addresses the underlying causes of physical inactivity through accommodation or transformation of those gender norms.

A national evaluation is assessing whether gender-focused public health systems approaches are sustainable and cost effective in addressing health disparities in women and girls. To inform the evaluation, a systematic examination was conducted of literature in both the public and private sector designed to track, assess, understand, and improve women's health, public health systems approaches, and the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of gender-based programs. A two-person team assured the quality of the results following the review of abstracts and full-text articles.

This is largely due to the complex design of many of the interventions, coupled with difficulties in measuring the outcome and impact of these interventions. This article proposes a number of ways to improve these evaluations both at the community and individual level. We recommend use of organizational theory and narrative inquiry methods, such as the appreciative inquiry technique, to examine how communities design gender-based interventions. In addition, we suggest a variety of methods to measure the effects of these interventions on gender norms in the community for example, policy analysis, multilevel modeling, and social conversations. With respect to measuring outcomes at the individual level, we argue for more rigorous evaluation designs in order to improve internal and external validity claims. Additionally, we suggest that evaluations should incorporate different methodologies, for example autobiographical narratives, which allows one to give saliency to the subjective voices of participants. Finally, we emphasize that evaluation designs need to document the long term effects of intervention programs and define the expected outcomes with greater specificity.

Underpinning CHC is a gender-based focus that uses a network of community partners working collaboratively to generate relevant behavior change and improved health outcomes. Ten programs are trying to determine whether gender-focused system approaches are cost-effective ways to address health disparities in women and girls. Programs implemented through coalitions made up of academic institutions, public health departments, community-based organizations, and local, regional, and national organizations, are addressing health issues such as domestic violence, cardiovascular disease prevention, physical activity, and healthy eating. Although these programs are ongoing, they have made significant progress. Key factors contributing to their early success include a comprehensive needs assessment, robust coalitions, the diversity of populations targeted, programs based on findings of the needs assessments, evaluations taking into consideration the effect of gender, and strong academic-community partnerships. A noteworthy impact of these programs has been their ability to shape and impact public, social, and health policies at the state and local levels. However, there have been challenges associated with the implementation of such a complex program. Lessons learned are discussed in this paper.

The health of rural women, in particular, is influenced by their knowledge, work and family commitments, as well as environmental barriers in their communities. In rural southern Illinois, the seven southernmost counties form a region that experiences high rates of cancer and other chronic diseases. To identify, understand, and prioritize the health needs of women living in these seven counties, a comprehensive gender-based community health assessment was conducted with the goal of developing a plan to improve women's health in the region. A gender-analysis framework was adapted, and key stakeholder interviews and focus groups with community women were conducted and analyzed to identify factors affecting ill health. The gender-based analysis revealed that women play a critical role in the health of their families and their communities, and these roles can influence their personal health. The gender-based analysis also identified several gender-specific barriers and facilitators that affect women's health and their ability to engage in healthy behaviors. These results have important implications for the development of programs and policies to improve health among rural women.

Thus, adolescents' engagement in health risk or promoting behaviors is influenced by perceptions of masculinity and femininity and the differences in expectations, norms and responsibilities for girls and boys (WHO, 2007). Girls and boys have different needs, and gender-based interventions that consider similarities as well as differences are needed. A gender-based nutrition and sexual health promotion program was developed and piloted by the Philadelphia Ujima Coalition in a high school setting. To explore the gender differences in adolescents' perceptions of the influence of gender norms on weight, nutrition, physical activity, and sexual health and the implication of these differences in future gender-integrated health promotion programming for youth, a content analysis of student and facilitator debriefing forms were implemented for the participating schools. The content analysis was used to identify central themes, concepts gained, and overall impact of the intervention sessions. Overall, gender norms influence healthy eating practices and activity through influencing perceptions of body type in adolescents. Gender norms also influence sexual activity and decision making through influencing perceptions of beauty, masculinity, femininity, pressures and popular concepts related to sexual activity. Thus, interventions that address gender may more effectively promote health and wellness in adolescents.

These challenges place them at high risk for poor health outcomes. The purpose of this article is to describe the formation of a strong cross-system Coalition representing both the criminal justice and healthcare systems to address the health needs of sex workers in Delaware. The Delaware Coalition for Health and Justice implemented a Coalition-building strategy to design interventions and streamline systems to promote health and reduce criminal justice contact for sex workers. The sequential intercept model was utilized to organize Coalition membership and build consensus among varied stakeholders. The model assisted the Coalition in understanding differing primary objectives for key system programs, recognizing the limitations and barriers of each stakeholder group, sharing findings and discovering opportunities for partnership, and engaging stakeholders in designing and providing a comprehensive \"systems\" approach. This work suggests that aligning the criminal justice, healthcare, and community social services in a systemic process to build consensus can result in the implementation of effective systems change initiatives that address gender disparities and promote the health of justice-involved women.

Within the United States, there is both a paucity of research as well as planned programs that take into account how socio-cultural roles and expectations for men and women may differentially affect symptoms, access to care, and treatment. Viewing women's health exclusively as a function of sex (i.e., biological) differences represents a narrow understanding that does not fully explain gaps in health disparities between men and women. In September 2010, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) launched a national initiative entitled the Coalition for a Healthier Community (CHC) to employ a gender-based framework in several urban, suburban and rural communities across the nation.

We utilized a gender-based mixed methods approach to learn about the underlying social, cultural and gender issues that contribute to the increased obesity risk among these women and to inform intervention development. A literature review and analysis of Utah's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data informed the development of a focus group guide. Focus groups were conducted with five groups of women: African immigrants from Burundi and Rwanda, African Americans, American Indians/Alaskan Natives, Hispanics/Latinas, and Pacific Islanders. Six common themes emerged: (1) health is multidimensional and interventions must address health in this manner; (2) limited resources and time influence health behaviors; (3) norms about healthy weight vary, with certain communities showing more preference to heavier women; (4) women and men have important but different influences on healthy lifestyle practices within households; (5) women have an influential role on the health of families; and (6) opportunities exist within each group to improve health. Seeking insights from these five groups of women helped to identify common and distinct cultural and gender themes related to obesity, which can be used to help elucidate core obesity determinants.

This is a problem for programme planners and evaluators as the ability to measure programme success is grounded in the plausibility of the programme's underlying causal logic. Where the programme theory has not been documented, conducting a theory evaluation offers a foundational evaluation step as it gives an indication of whether the theory behind a programme is sound. This paper presents a case of a theory evaluation of a Global Citizenship programme at a top-ranking university in South Africa, subsequently called the GCSA Programme. This evaluation highlights the need for documented programme theory in global citizenship-type programmes for future programme development. An articulated programme theory produced for the GCSA Programme, analysed against the available social science literature, indicated it is comparable to other such programmes in terms of its overarching framework. What the research found is that most other global citizenship programmes do not have an articulated programme theory. These programmes also do not explicitly link their specific activities to their intended outcomes, making demonstrating impact impossible. In conclusion, we argue that taking a theory-based approach can strengthen and enable outcome evaluations in global citizenship programmes.

In fact, the strikingly scant empirical attention that these settings have received so far contrasts with the role that they often play as gateway into the child welfare system. To answer these calls, this work presents and tests a framework for assessing a service model in residential emergency care. It comprises seven studies which address a set of different focal areas (e.g., service logic model; care experiences), informants (e.g., case records; staff; children/youth), and service components (e.g., case assessment/evaluation; intervention; placement/referral). Drawing on this process-consultation approach, the work proposes a set of key challenges for emergency residential care in terms of service improvement and development, and calls for further research targeting more care units and different types of residential care services. These findings offer a contribution to inform evidence-based practice and policy in service models of residential care.

However, there are few published works that consider the opinions of health care professionals. This article aims to conjointly analyse two organisational strategies that determine professional health care practice: continuous training and quality of care. The objective is to examine the opinions of physicians and nurses on the improvement of the quality of care after a 'learning by doing' program. An evaluation method was designed that integrates the main variables that intervene in quality of care. An online questionnaire was utilised for collecting opinions on the effects of the training program. A total of 184 nurses and 180 other medical professionals participated in the program and all of them were asked to complete the questionnaire. A descriptive, and inferential statistical analysis was undertaken and results showed that there is a direct relationship between perceptions about: satisfaction, professional competence, training modality, optimisation of health resources and quality of care.

Home visitation programs to support parenting may offer hope as a preventive resource but these programs are rarely linked with child welfare. This article describes findings from a formative evaluation of a program designed to connect child welfare-involved families to an existing evidence-supported home visitation program. The program, Early Childhood Connections (ECC), was developed by a field-university partnership including leaders from a public state child welfare system, regional early childhood education systems, and several local agencies providing family support services. Despite extensive and rigorous planning by the workgroup and collaborative refining of the intervention approach as agency needs changed, the continued structural and policy changes within both the home visitation agency and the child welfare agencies created significant ongoing barriers to implementation. On the other hand, child welfare-involved families were receptive to engaging with home visitation. Implications of lessons learned for ongoing program development in this area are discussed.

Interest in SI has intensified rapidly in the last decade, making it an important area of practice for evaluators, but a difficult one to navigate. Learning from developments in SI and evaluation approaches applied in SI contexts is challenging because of 'fuzzy' concepts and silos of activity and knowledge within SI communities. This study presents findings from a systematic review and integration of 41 empirical studies on evaluation in SI contexts. We identify two isolated conversations: one about 'social enterprises' (SEs) and the other about non-SE 'social innovations'. These conversations diverge in key areas, including engagement with evaluation scholarship, and in the reported purposes, approaches and use of evaluation. We identified striking differences with respect to degree of interest in collaborative approaches and facilitation of evaluation use. The findings speak to trends and debates in our field, for example how evaluation might reconcile divergent information needs in multilevel, cross-sectoral collaborations and respond to fluidity and change in innovative settings. Implications for practitioners and commissioners of evaluation include how evaluation is used in different contexts and the voice of evaluators (and the evaluation profession) in these conversations.

It also promotes the principles of listening to parents and involving them in decision-making. The present review analysed published research that investigated parental perspectives on the child protection services they received. It identified 52 studies published between 2000 and 2016 on parent satisfaction. Most used qualitative methods, and eight standardised survey instruments were used in quantitative studies. Factors related to parent satisfaction or dissatisfaction related to the attitudes and skills of workers, the interventions provided, and aspects of the child protection system.

It combines a quantitative pattern matching framework traditionally used in theory-driven evaluation with crowdsourcing to analyze qualitative interview data. A sample of crowdsourced participants are asked to read an interview transcript and identify whether program theory components (Activities and Outcomes) are discussed and to highlight the most relevant passage about that component. The findings indicate that using crowdsourcing to analyze qualitative data can differentiate between program theory components that are supported by a participant's experience and those that are not. This approach expands the range of tools available to validate program theory using qualitative data, thus strengthening the theory-driven approach.

Los Angeles County has the largest and most diverse population of homeless individuals in the nation. We randomly selected for analysis 52 drug-treatment programs and 2158 participants who identified as homeless in the Los Angeles County Participant Reporting System in 2011. We included their living arrangements (indoors and stable, indoors and unstable, and outdoors) and individual and program characteristics (particularly whether their programs used six culturally competent practices) in multilevel regression analyses. The outcome was days of primary drug use at discharge.Results showed that higher levels of staff personal involvement in minority communities (IRR=0.437; 95% CI=0.222, 0.861) and 0.406; 95% CI=0.213, 0.771) were associated with fewer days of drug use at discharge. Homeless individuals living outdoors used their primary drug more often than any other group. Yet, compared to individuals with other living arrangements, when outdoor homeless individuals were treated by programs with the highest community resources and linkages (IRR=0.364; 95% CI=0.157, 0.844), they reported the fewest days of drug use.

However, it is often neglected due to limited knowledge and skills of the community health workers (kader). We conducted health promotion training for the kader and village midwives in four villages in Cianjur district. This study describes the use of \"most significant change\" (MSC) technique to evaluate impact of health promotion to the beneficiaries and community at large. The MSC uses stories as raw data. Through interviews focused on perception of change, stories were collected from four pregnant women, eight kader and three village midwives. A Panel consisting of policy and programme managers and implementers read all the stories. The story by a pregnant woman who routinely attended Posyandu was selected as the story with most significant change. Her story highlighted changes in kader's knowledge and communication of health messages and attitude towards pregnant women. She expressed these changes impacted community awareness about health and to seek help from kader.The MSC technique enabled stakeholders to view raw data and evaluate the impact of health promotion from the beneficiary's perspective. At the same time, recipients of health promotion contributed to the decision process of evaluation through their stories. The different perspectives on the MSC reflected individual's objectives of the health promotion. The application of this technique is limited in maternal health promotion programme in Indonesia, and none have been published in peer reviewed journals.

Most interventions that aim to prevent sexual violence before it occurs target individual-level change or promote bystander training. Community-level interventions, while increasingly recommended in the sexual violence prevention field, are rarely documented in peer-reviewed literature. This paper is a targeted process evaluation of Project Envision, a 6-year pilot initiative to address social norms at the root of sexual violence through coalition building and community mobilization in three New York City neighborhoods, and reflects the perspectives of those charged with designing and implementing the program. Evaluation methods included a systematic literature review, archival source document review, and key informant interviews. Three themes emerged from the results: community identity and implications for engagement; capacity and readiness for community mobilization and consequences for implementation; and impacts on participants. Lessons learned include the limitations of using geographic boundaries to structure community interventions in urban settings; carefully considering whether communities should be mobilized around an externally-identified issue; translating theoretical frameworks into concrete tasks; assessing all coalition partners and organizations for readiness; critically evaluating available resources; and recognizing that community organizing is a skill that requires investment from funders. We conclude that Project Envision showed promise for shifting institutional norms towards addressing root causes of sexual violence in addition to providing victim services.

The program draws conceptual guidance from the Head-Heart-Hands model that informs the current educational movement to foster environmental understanding and sustainability. Employing an experimental design and data from seven cohorts of students, we find some promising, albeit preliminary, indications that the program can increase students' science knowledge and grades in mathematics, science and language arts.

However, measuring R&D performance and assigning the same level of importance to different R&D measures, which is the common approach in existing studies, can oversimplify the R&D measuring process, which may result in misinterpretation of the performance and consequently fallacy R&D strategies. The aim of this study is to measure R&D performance taking into account the different levels of importance of R&D measures, using a multi-criteria decision-making method called Best Worst Method (BWM) to identify the weights (importance) of R&D measures and measure the R&D performance of 50 high-tech SMEs in the Netherlands using the data gathered in a survey among SMEs and from R&D experts. The results show how assigning different weights to different R&D measures (in contrast to simple mean) results in a different ranking of the firms and allow R&D managers to formulate more effective strategies to improve their firm's R&D performance by applying knowledge regarding the importance of different R&D measures.

The transformative paradigm is a research framework that centers the experiences of marginalized communities, includes analysis of power differentials that have led to marginalization, and links research findings to actions intended to mitigate disparities. We argue that a community needs assessment is a natural fit for the use of a transformative framework, serving as an entry-point for the development of responsive programmatic and funding decisions. Based on a case study of efforts initiated by a local community health foundation to document disparities in their city, we show how an evaluation team used principles aligned with the transformative framework to guide the design and implementation of a community needs assessment. The needs assessment provided a better understanding of the power of community relationships, demonstrated how lack of trust can continue to constrain community voices, and revealed why agencies must actively support a social justice framework beyond the end of an assessment to ensure transformative change.

This issue has been identified as a top priority for many correctional administrators in the United States. Managed access, a technology that utilizes cellular signals to capture transmissions from contraband phones, has received notable attention as a promising tool to combat this problem. However, this technology has received little evaluative attention. The present study offers a foundational process evaluation and draws upon output measures and stakeholder interviews to identify salient operational challenges and subsequent lessons learned about implementing and maintaining a managed access system. Findings suggest that while managed access captures large volumes of contraband cellular transmissions, the technology requires significant implementation planning, personnel support, and complex partnerships with commercial cellular carriers. Lessons learned provide guidance for practitioners to navigate these challenges and for scholars to improve future evaluations of managed access.

Nowadays, there are a lot of online resources, such as MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) and distance learning courses. One aspect that is common to all of these is a high dropout rate: about 90% in MOOCs and 50% in the courses of the Spanish National Distance Education University, among other examples. In this paper, we analyze a number of actions undertaken in the Master's Degree in Computational Mathematics at Universitat Jaume I in Castell\u00f3n, Spain.

Parents have expressed dissatisfaction with the care they received at the ED and few interventions have been developed for improving miscarriage care. When planning an intervention, it is crucial to develop a program theory specifying what must be done for an intervention to achieve its objectives. The purpose of this paper is to describe the logic model process for developing an intervention intended to improve parents' miscarriage experience at the ED. The six steps of W. K. Kellogg Foundation (2004) theory logic model were used to 1) describe the problem; 2) conduct a needs assessment; and to identify 3) expected results, 4) influential factors, 5) intervention strategies, and 6) assumptions related to change strategies. A community-based participatory approach was used. It included two planning groups: parents who had visited the ED for a miscarriage (N = 9) and health professionals (N = 8). The theory logic model provided a rigorous framework for intervention development based on theories, scientific evidence, and the experiences of parents and health professionals. Detailed description of the intervention should facilitate its implementation, evaluation, and replication for other health problems.

Such information is particularly relevant for 'vulnerable' workers, whose employment situation has the potential to alter their social and economic position in life. Based on data gathered from 111 leaders and 547 vulnerable workers in 36 social profit organizations, multilevel regression analysis demonstrates that EPM is related to vulnerable workers' quality of life. Moreover, authentic leadership and psychological empowerment buffer the negative relationship between EPM and vulnerable workers' quality of life. These findings imply that organizations that employ vulnerable workers need authentic leaders to foster a positive impact not only on performance through EPM but also on vulnerable workers' quality of life. In addition, organizations can also pursue vulnerable workers' psychological empowerment by providing tasks that are meaningful to them and in which they experience self-efficacy to reduce the potential negative effects of EPM on vulnerable workers' quality of life.

Corresponding to this shift, the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention (DHAP) began funding a series of multi-site demonstration projects to provide extra support and evaluative capacity to select health departments to initiate new HIP programming, with the intention of ascertaining and sharing lessons with other health departments. In this paper, we provide context for the PrEP, Implementation, Data2Care, Evaluation (PrIDE) evaluation by describing the evolution of evaluation goals and activities across three prior demonstration projects, highlighting four areas of change: 1) integrated evaluation and program implementation; 2) local program evaluation in addition to cross-site performance monitoring; 3) prescriptive allocation of resources to support local program evaluation; and 4) expansion beyond single site program evaluation to identify effective cross-site programmatic strategies. Together, these changes reflect our own learning about achieving the greatest contribution from multi-site projects and set the stage for unique aspects of program evaluation within PrIDE. We describe these features, concluding with lessons learned from this most recent approach to structuring and supporting evaluation within CDC DHAP's health department demonstration projects.

The empirical investigation took the form of mixed-methods approach with the objectives to determine the extent to which PM&E influences citizen empowerment; establish the extent to which citizen empowerment influences social sustainability; and establish the joint influence of PM&E and citizen empowerment on social sustainability. The study employed a concurrent parallel design, in which samples for quantitative and qualitative components were different but drawn from the same population, and data collected within the same timeframe. Quantitative data were analyzed through bivariate and multiple regression analyses. Conversely, the qualitative component utilized interpretive technique and recursive abstraction to organize, summarize and give impression on the causal mechanisms at play in the quantitative data. Evidence from the study revealed that citizen empowerment mediates the relationship between PM&E and social sustainability. The study also found that when PM&E and citizen empowerment are considered together, citizen empowerment seems to have a dominant influence on social sustainability than PM&E itself. Thus, the government and development practitioners should prioritize citizen empowerment as a precursor to the realization of social sustainability outcomes.

In this evaluation, we assess the feasibility, acceptability, fit, and potential efficacy of the MOSH curriculum to improve proximal provider-level outcomes, including self-efficacy to provide MOSH-related independent living skills and supports. Homeless-services providers (N = 49) from a range of programs and settings participated in the training. Findings from focus groups and pre- and posttest surveys indicate high levels of overall satisfaction with the training. The majority of trainees perceived the training to be useful to their work and potentially useful for service recipients, felt the training would fit well within their existing day-to-day work, and said they were very likely to use MOSH skills in such work. Statistically significant improvements in self-efficacy regarding all skills but one were also found. MOSH holds promise as an intervention that can enhance provider practice and promotion of independent living skills in homeless services. Although these initial findings on MOSH are encouraging, further research will be needed to evaluate provider knowledge gains and effective use of these skills in practice.

This study aimed to determine factors influencing farmers' satisfaction with extension services. Data were collected through a questionnaire from a random sample of 393 farmers in the Kafr El Sheikh governorate. Farmers assessed the quality of extension services by five main indicators: (1) availability, (2) accessibility, (3) diversity, (4) relevance, and (5) effectiveness. Descriptive statistics and a logistic-regression model were used to analyze the data. Results showed that farmers had lowly participated in the provided extension services. The accessibility of services was ranked first with regard to satisfaction, while diversity of services was the lowest-ranked quality attribute. Results also revealed that factors significantly influencing farmers' satisfaction included farm size, diversity of farming activities, annual income, and participation in extension services.

However, evaluators have faced a number of challenges linked to the lack of consensus on the meaning of the concept of \"sustainability\". This paper aims to describe a methodology, the Sustainability Analysis Process, based on several conceptual frameworks and tested in five different countries in the physical rehabilitation sector. The methodology consists of five successive steps: (i) overview of the context; (ii) system boundary; (iii) consensus vision of sustainability, and derivation of stakeholder perspectives; (iv) selection of sustainability indicators and characterization and analysis of local system sustainability; and (v) verification and modification. The paper also discusses the place of the evaluator and researcher in the process: the methodology aims to help evaluators objectively measure the level of sustainability of a health system with the challenge of dealing with a subjective notion, the concept of sustainability, and a diversity of actors. The Sustainability Analysis Process also aims to capture the dynamics of systems by repeating the process on a regular basis. The methodology highlights the need for evaluators build consensus amongst stakeholders on a common vision of the future of a health system.

The purpose of this article is to explain how participatory, responsive, educative, and qualitative approaches to formative evaluation can facilitate a partnership between evaluators and educational researchers and program managers to generate data useful to inform program implementation and improvement. This partnership is critical, we argue, because it enables an awareness of when to take appropriate action to ensure successful educational programs or \"kairos\". To illustrate, we use examples from our own evaluation work to highlight how formative evaluation may facilitate opportune moments to (1) define the substance and purpose of a program, (2) develop understanding and awareness of the cultural interpretations of program participants, and (3) show the relevance of stakeholder experiences to program goals.

Research policy has taken on an increasingly prominent role in the broader political scene, where research is seen as a critical factor in maintaining and improving growth, welfare and international competitiveness. This has motivated growing emphasis on the impacts of science funding, and how funding can best be designed to promote socio-economic progress. Meeting these demands for impact assessment involves a number of complex issues that are difficult to fully address in a single study or in the design of a single methodology. However, they point to some general principles that can be explored in methodological design. We draw on a recent evaluation of the impacts of research grant funding, discussing both key issues in developing a methodology for the analysis and subsequent results. The case of research grant funding, involving a complex mix of direct and intermediate effects that contribute to the overall impact of funding on research performance, illustrates the value of a mixed methods approach to provide a more robust and complete analysis of policy impacts. Reflections on the strengths and weaknesses of the methodology are used to examine refinements for future work.

Humanitarian NGOs and intergovernmental organisations are usually assessed by their funders, not their beneficiaries. In most cases, their evaluation relies on interviews with \"professionals\", neglects field surveys, does not use opinion polls and seldom tries to assess the socioeconomic impact of relief. Moreover, it is commissioned by stakeholders at the risk of being judge and party. Such a system brings several conflicts of interest: (1) it needs to be approved by those who are evaluated and so does not deal with \"bad eggs\" that refuse to be investigated; (2) it produces biased analysis, does not name names and passes over fundamental issues; (3) it is very formal and technocratic, if not meaningless; (4) it does not help to learn from past mistakes. Hence this article proposes a framework to develop third party evaluations. It is suggested that, to be really independent, evaluation should neither be paid or commissioned by stakeholders, i.e. NGOs and institutional funders. To facilitate learning, its methodology and its results must also be available to the general public. To be accepted by those who are evaluated, finally, it should highlight the difficulties, explain the political context, acknowledge its subjectivity, recognize its limits, focus on processes more than results and develop qualitative analysis out of quantitative indicators.

One area of interest concerns the possible benefits that on-site child care could have for improving veterans' access to VA mental health care. Child care programs are currently being piloted at the VA for the first time, although the need for them has not been evaluated. We conducted a brief survey of a convenience sample of 147 veterans (132 men, 15 women) seeking mental health care at outpatient clinics and/or at a psychiatric rehabilitation center at one VA. Participants were asked about their attitudes and experiences regarding child care and parenting support at the VA. Of the 52 (35.4%) participants who responded and had children under 18, the majority of both men and women surveyed agreed that the VA should offer child care services and that they would use child care services at the VA if it were available. These results are based on a small sample of participants, but they may contribute to ongoing discussion and efforts to develop \"family-friendly\" mental health services.

Social network characteristics have been known to be influential in motivating people's decision to seek services. Traditional theoretical frameworks applied to studies of service use emphasize individual factors over social contexts and interactions. Using key social network, social capital, and social influence theories, this paper developed an integrated theoretical framework that capture the social network processes that act as barriers or facilitators of use of employment services by homeless youth, and understand empirically, the salience of each of these constructs in influencing the use of employment services among homeless youth. We used the \"Event based-approach\" strategy to recruit a sample of 136 homeless youth at one drop-in agency serving homeless youth in Los Angeles, California in 2008. The participants were queried regarding their individual and network characteristics. Data were entered into NetDraw 2.090 and the spring embedder routine was used to generate the network visualizations. Logistic regression was used to assess the influence of the network characteristics on use of employment services. The study findings suggest that social capital is more significant in understanding why homeless youth use employment services, relative to network structure and network influence. In particular, bonding and bridging social capital were found to have differential effects on use of employment services among this population. The results from this study provide specific directions for interventions aimed to increase use of employment services among homeless youth.

This study adapted and piloted a contextual validity assessment framework on a selection of health inequity-related programs funded by the Canadian Health Services Research Foundation (CHSRF) between 1998 and 2006. The two overarching objectives of this study were (1) to determine the relative amount and quality of attention given to conceptualizing, measuring and validating context within CHSRF funded research final reports related to health-inequity; and (2) to contribute evaluative evidence towards the incorporation of context into the assessment and measurement of health inequity interventions. The study found that of the 42/146 CHSRF programs and projects, judged to be related to health inequity 20 adequately reported on the conceptualization, measurement and validation of context. Amongst these health-inequity related project reports, greatest emphasis was placed on describing the socio-political and economical context over actually measuring and validating contextual evidence. Applying a contextual validity assessment framework was useful for distinguishing between the descriptive (conceptual) versus empirical (measurement and validation) inclusion of documented contextual evidence. Although contextual validity measurement frameworks needs further development, this study contributes insight into identifying funded research related to health inequities and preliminary criteria for assessing interventions targeted at specific populations and jurisdictions. This study also feeds a larger critical dialogue (albeit beyond the scope of this study) regarding the relevance and utility of using evaluative techniques for understanding how specific external conditions support or impede the successful implementation of health inequity interventions.

The control group has companies which planned to participate in the Program but had not done so up to that date. The response variable measures the ratio of export to total sales for each company. Four covariates have been taken into account: activity, location, sales and number of employees.

The context is Grand-Popo, a fishing municipality located on Benin's southwest Atlantic coast. The fishery management interventionists and the fishing communities in the municipality all espoused concern for the sustainable improvement of fishing actors' livelihood conditions, but differed about the reasons for this livelihood impairment, and about what should be done, when, where, and by whom. Given this ambiguity, we identified RE as a promising action research approach to facilitate dialogue and mutual learning, and consequently to improve stakeholders' ability to resolve problems. However, this approach seems to have some shortcomings in the Grand-Popo context, regarding the repetitive ineffectiveness of interventions, high complexity, and uncertainty. Therefore, based on our empirical study, we add three dimensions to the existing RE framework: historical analysis to deal with routine interventions, exploration and discussion of incongruities of action theories to trigger double-loop learning, and system analysis to deal with complexity and uncertainty. This article does not intend to address the implications or impact of this adapted RE framework. Instead, we suggest some criteria and indicators for evaluating whether the proposed amended RE approach has assisted in resolving the fishery problems in Grand-Popo after the approach has been applied.

The monitoring plan, a key component in our multiyear participatory statewide evaluation process, was co-developed with the end users: representatives of the health councils. Guided by the Institute of Medicine's Community, Health Improvement Process framework, we first developed a logic model that delineated processes and intermediate systems-level outcomes in council development, planning, and community action. Through the online system, health councils reported data on intermediate outcomes, including policy changes and funds leveraged. The system captured data that were common across the health council system, yet was also flexible so that councils could report their unique accomplishments at the county level. A main benefit of the online system was that it provided the ability to assess intermediate, outcomes across the health council system. Developing the system was not without challenges, including creating processes to ensure participation across a large rural state; creating shared understanding of intermediate outcomes and indicators; and overcoming technological issues. Even through the challenges, however, the benefits of committing to using participatory processes far outweighed the challenges.

Process evaluation; Multicomponent intervention; your impact\": Evaluating transitional justice in contested spaces This paper discusses some of the most significant challenges and opportunities for evaluating the effects of programs in support of transitional justice - the field that addresses how post-conflict or post authoritarian societies deal with legacies of wide spread human rights violations. The discussion is empirically grounded in a case study that assesses the efforts of the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and one of its Guatemalan partners to evaluate the effects of a museum exposition that is attempting to recast historic memory and challenge racist attitudes in post-conflict Guatemala. The paper argues that despite the increasing trend to fund transitional justice programs, many international aid donors are stuck in traditional and arguably orthodox paradigms of program evaluation. This is having a negative effect not only upon the administration of aid but also upon how transitional justice research is perceived and valued by local populations. The case study experience indicates that there is no perfect evaluation model or approach for evaluating transitional justice programming - only choices to be made by commissioners of evaluation, evaluators, and those being evaluated. These are profoundly influenced by the extreme politics and moral values that define transitional justice settings as contested spaces in which calls to remember the tragic past must be balanced with aspirations to re-build a hopeful future.

Evaluating participatory decision processes serves two key purposes: validating the usefulness of specific interventions for stakeholders, interveners and funders of conflict management processes, and improving practice. However, evaluation design remains challenging, partly because when attempting to serve both purposes we may end up serving neither well. In fact, the better we respond to one, the less we may satisfy the other. Evaluations tend to focus on endogenous factors (e.g., stakeholder selection, BATNAs, mutually beneficial tradeoffs, quality of the intervention, etc.), because we believe that the success of participatory decision processes hinges on them, and they also seem to lend themselves to caeteris paribus statistical comparisons across cases. We argue that context matters too and that contextual differences among specific cases are meaningful enough to undermine conclusions derived solely from comparisons of process-endogenous factors implicitly rooted in the caeteris paribus assumption. We illustrate this argument with an environmental mediation case. We compare data collected about it through surveys geared toward comparability across cases to information elicited through in-depth interviews geared toward case specifics. The surveys, designed by the U.S. Institute of Environmental Conflict Resolution, feed a database of environmental conflicts that can help make the (statistical) case for intervention in environmental conflict management. Our interviews elicit case details - including context - that enable interveners to link context specifics and intervention actions to outcomes. We argue that neither approach can \"serve both masters.\" Evaluation instruments; Participatory decision processes; Environmental conflicts; 2014 11 20 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149718913000700 Kaufman, Sanda Ozawa, Connie P.

This article examines how the evaluation process surrounding a regional public health plan (referred to as PRSP) - itself being a new instrument for regional planning in France - accords with one of these principles, which specifies that evaluation must be framed according to \"a three-fold logic involving public management, democracy and scientific debate.\" Our analysis shows that while this evaluation was driven primarily by managerial concerns (i.e., assessing the capacity of the plan to structure health policy in a region), it also provided an Opportunity for restoring dialogue with a range of actors by opening up a space of cooperation and consultation. In addition, in order to ensure the legitimacy of the evaluation's conclusions, the knowledge produced by the evaluators had to rest on an irreproachable methodology. This example illustrates how evaluation, in the French tradition, is a process that strives to reconcile the viewpoints and expectations of managers, scientists and the general public; it is also a process that brings out lines of tension and areas of complementariness between these three logics.

This represents a step-wise, significant, change in provision for the assessment of values-based achievements that are of absolutely key importance to most civil society organisations (CSOs) and values-based businesses, and fills a known gap in evaluation practice. In this paper, we demonstrate the significance and rigour of the toolkit by presenting an evaluation of it in three diverse scenarios where different CSOs use it to co-evaluate locally relevant outcomes and processes to obtain results which are both meaningful to them and potentially comparable across organisations. A key strength of the toolkit is its original use of a prior generated, peer-elicited 'menu' of values-based indicators which provides a framework for user CSOs to localise. Principles of participatory, process-based and utilisation-focused evaluation are embedded in this toolkit and shown to be critical to its success, achieving high face-validity and wide applicability.

Such practical participatory evaluation (PPE) aims to increase the use of evaluation results through the participation of stakeholders. This study focuses on the propensity of health managers for PPE, as measured through the components of learning, working in groups, use of judgment and use of systematic methods. We interviewed 16 health managers to determine the meaning they ascribe to these four components in their practice in a developing country, Ha\u00efti. We found that learning was often informal and that all managers attached a negative meaning to the use of judgment. Working in groups was favored by all managers, while the health managers viewed the use of systematic methods differently than do evaluators. The administrative health managers generally ranked lower in propensity for PPE than did their clinical colleagues. Implications for the practice of evaluation are discussed in relation to the work styles exhibited by managers in everyday practice, the proactive repetition of actions, the control exercised by formal procedures, and the collective versus \"solitary\" image of one's environment of action.

Champagne, Fran\u00e7ois Farand, Lambert Implications for evaluators, researchers, practitioners, funders and the evidence-based program mandate Evolutionary theory, developmental systems theory, and evolutionary epistemology provide deep theoretical foundations for understanding programs, their development over time, and the role of evaluation. This paper relates core concepts from these powerful bodies of theory to program evaluation. Evolutionary Evaluation is operationalized in terms of program and evaluation evolutionary phases, which are in turn aligned with multiple types of validity. The model of Evolutionary Evaluation incorporates Chen's conceptualization of bottom-up versus top-down program development. The resulting framework has important implications for many program management and evaluation issues. The paper illustrates how an Evolutionary Evaluation perspective can illuminate important controversies in evaluation using the example of the appropriate role of randomized controlled trials that encourages a rethinking of \"evidence-based programs\". From an Evolutionary Evaluation perspective, prevailing interpretations of rigor and mandates for evidence-based programs pose significant challenges to program evolution. This perspective also illuminates the consequences of misalignment between program and evaluation phases; the importance of supporting both researcher-derived and practitioner-derived programs; and the need for variation and evolutionary phase diversity within portfolios of programs.

In this study, we helped design a service to support the transition of youth from residential care to independent living by exploring the perspectives of staff and of youth regarding: (a) the concept and development of autonomy; and (b) key factors in developing this type of service. We gathered the data through 10 interviews with staff (n=10) and 4 focus groups with youth (n=21), and subjected the data to a thematic content analysis. Staff defined autonomy as self-regulation and self-care, and identified three paths to foster autonomy - a sense of normality, meaningful relationships, and planning for emancipation. The staff and youth identified the following important aspects in designing the service: achieving normality (e.g. limited number of residents), promoting youth capacity (e.g. skill-building activities), providing social support (e.g. trust and respect between residents), and assuring guidance and boundaries (e.g. supervision of youth).

We call this a \"blended approach\" and describe these methods. Satisfaction and demand for TCEC services are documented to provide measurements for evaluation capacity building.

This methodology provided a novel approach and diagnostic tool for understanding HIV infection transmission risk and drug use in the typical niche of IDUs, i.e., a \"shooting gallery\" (a gathering site for injection drug activity). Furthermore, component IDUs may have memberships in multiple \"shooting galleries\" revealing subsequent interconnectivities. Charting of IDU connectivity diagrams illustrated the relationships of peripheral sites to the critical central core of high HIV transmission risk. Members of this highly interlinked and infectious central core of IDUs had high HIV transmission risk and severe drug use\u2014producing high morbidity and mortality that resulted in great public health concern. In addition, connectivity diagrams reveal very high HIV transmission risk in component IDUs in \"dual memberships\", i.e., membership in more than one central core (with the highest number of partners). Therefore, IDUs with \"dual memberships\" were the most infectious members of the \"shooting gallery\". In summation, network mapping of HIV transmission risk in IDUs allows for subsequent socio-behavioral analysis and the development of focused individual and programmatic interventions.

The government scholarship programme started in the 1950s already as a part of the Czechoslovak technical assistance to countries in the South. Even though the programme left tens of thousands of graduates all over the world, the recent programme evaluation has revealed that it is characterised by a relatively poor performance. This article brings forward the main outcomes of the programme evaluation, highlights the policy recommendations and summarises policy reflections that occurred following the evaluation. The programme evaluation was done under unfavourable circumstances and could be accordingly defined as 'shoestring evaluation'.

The programme under analysis is the National Reading Plan (NRP), a public policy initiative that aims to increase literacy levels and reading habits among the Portuguese population. It was evaluated throughout its first phase, which lasted five years (2006-2011), using an evaluation model that made it possible to continuously and systematically monitor and analyse the way in which this programme was developed and implemented. A number of different quantitative and qualitative methodological operations gathered information from a broad range of sources and social actors, covering the vast set of projects promoted by the NRP. We particularly look at the contributions made by mixing methods to the evaluation of the programme's impacts, and point out its potentials when it comes to evaluating wide-ranging, long and complex programmes.

The present study evaluates infrastructure capacity-building strategies and barriers and facilitators of two federally funded health-related research capacity building programs within the United States. We developed a conceptual framework and abstracted 223 data elements from existing project files. We administered questionnaires to 17 principal investigators and conducted 2-h interviews of 15 principal investigators. Finally, we conducted one-and-a-half-day site visits with five projects. We aggregated data and analysis results across the two programs. Impacts and strategies were also analyzed as to whether host institutions had little or no existing research infrastructure (\"seed projects\") or had well-developed research infrastructure (\"fertilizer projects\"). Projects were associated with increases in publication and presentation rates by Principal Investigators and staff, increases in research funding, changes in organizational research culture, and positive impacts on the community. Project characteristics and activities associated with each of these outcomes were identified. It was also noted that the correlations between these outcomes were small and non-significant.

Referred to as physical activity-based youth development programs, these program designs have great potential for promoting healthy youth development. This study examined how one such physical activity-based positive youth development program was implemented in order to identify design features critical to maximizing positive youth outcomes. This mixed method, multi-site process evaluation of Girls on the Run (GOTR) utilized focus groups, site visits, and self-report implementation checklists. Implementation scores were calculated to assess implementation fidelity across twenty-nine sites, and qualitative data were inductively analyzed to identify factors influential for implementation. Results reveal variability in how GOTR was implemented. Five themes emerged from the data that represented factors serving as facilitators or barriers to programmatic implementation. These included contextual/environmental factors (e.g., parental involvement, relationships with school personnel), organizational factors (e.g., implementation support and responsiveness of staff), program-specific factors (e.g., curriculum design), coach factors (e.g., existing relationships with participants, responsiveness to participant's needs), and youth factors (e.g., behavioral and discipline issues). Study findings have implications for improving the design of physical activity-based and other positive youth development programs, with relevance to evaluators, program planners, youth development leaders, and others working with children and youth.

With the help of the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF), advocacy groups that were able to navigate a complex intervention implementation process were identified. In all, 25 people involved in the Montreal At Home/Chez Soi project were surveyed through interviews (n=18) and a discussion group (n=7). Participant observations and documentation (minutes and correspondence) were also used for the analysis. The start-up phase of the At Home/Chez may be broken down into three separate periods qualified respectively as \"honeymoon;\" \"clash of cultures;\" and \"acceptance & commitment\". In each of the planning phases of the At Home/Chez Soi project in Montreal, at least two advocacy coalitions were in confrontation about their specific belief systems concerning solutions to address the recurring homelessness social problem, while a third, more moderate one contributed in rallying most key actors under specified secondary aspects. The study confirms the importance of policy brokers in achieving compromises acceptable to all advocacy coalitions.

The survey was conducted in an Ear-Nose-Throat outpatient clinic of a Greek public pediatric hospital. A total of 127 parents in outpatient waiting areas were chosen; 74.8% of the sampled parents were under 40, and 78% were mothers. A factor analysis was performed; while a Fischer's exact test and multinomial logistic regression analysis was conducted. All Cronbach's exceeded 0.70 and all factor loadings exceeded 0.50. Twenty-three items were retained through the scale development process and seven factors were formed that appear to be statistically valid and clinically meaningful: access and convenience, doctor's attention, customization, reliability, assurance, satisfaction and loyalty. Findings were discussed in relation to parents' overall satisfaction and intention of reusing and recommending outpatient clinic. Satisfaction was found to be positively affected by access and convenience and doctors' attention. Staff attitude and the telephone procedure of scheduling the child's examination found positively correlated to the likelihood of recommending services to friends and relatives. Time and communication in the waiting room influenced parents' satisfaction. Overall, results reveal the measures that need to be taken in order to improve outpatient service quality.

From 2007 to 2010 the Andean Change Alliance evaluated an agricultural research and development approach known as the \"Participatory Market Chain Approach\" (PMCA). Based on a study of four cases, this paper examines the fidelity of implementation, the factors that influenced implementation and results, and the PMCA change model. We identify three types of deviation from the intervention protocol (lapses, creative adaptations, and true infidelities) and five groups of variables that influenced PMCA implementation and results (attributes of the macro context, the market chain, the key actors, rules in use, and the capacity development strategy). There was insufficient information to test the validity of the PMCA change model, but results were greatest where the PMCA was implemented with highest fidelity. Our analysis suggests that the single most critical component of the PMCA is engagement of market agents - not just farmers - throughout the exercise. We present four lessons for planning and evaluating participatory approaches related to the use of action and change models, the importance of monitoring implementation fidelity, the limits of baseline survey data for outcome evaluation, and the importance of capacity development for implementers.

The first stage involved a theoretical conceptualization using a participatory method of concept mapping. This process identified the modes of evaluation utilization within the organization, produced a representation of the relationship between them and led to a theory. The second stage examined the practical implications of this conceptualization in terms of how different stakeholders in the organization perceive the actual and preferable state of evaluation utilization within the organization (i.e. to what extent is evaluation utilized and to what extent should it be utilized). The participatory process of the study promoted the evaluation utilization by involving stakeholders, thus giving them a sense of ownership and improving communication between the evaluation unit and the stakeholders. In addition, understanding the evaluation needs of the stakeholders in the organization helped generate relevant and realizable evaluation processes. On a practical level, the results are currently shaping the evaluation plan and the place of evaluations within the organization.

Through interviews with 43 unsheltered homeless individuals in the borough of Manhattan (age range 21-74 years), this qualitative study examined barriers they face in accessing housing and other services as well as experiences surviving on the street. Through thematic analysis of the interview data, the most common barriers found were obtaining required identification documents, lack of accessibility of shelters amid complex healthcare needs, waiting as part of the process, and exclusion of pets from shelters and housing options. Themes capturing survival on the street included sleeping safe, avoiding shelters, and meeting daily needs. Virtually all barriers street homeless New Yorkers face stem from bureaucratic policies that, however well-intentioned, do not address their diverse needs. Thus, long delays and poor communication, combined with crowded, unsafe shelters, lead to frustration and alienation. While homelessness is ultimately the result of a severe and chronic shortage of affordable housing, creating accessible, safe, pet-friendly shelter and safe haven options and instituting a smoother, more transparent process for moving from the streets could substantially reduce street homelessness.

Fidelity ratings for 10 Housing First programs in five cities were made by an external quality assurance team along five key dimensions of Housing First based on 84 key informant interviews, 10 consumer focus groups, and 100 chart reviews. An additional 72 key informant interviews and 35 focus groups yielded qualitative data on factors that helped or hindered implementation. Overall, the findings show a high degree of fidelity to the model with more than 71% of the fidelity items being scored higher than 3 on a 4-point scale. The qualitative research found that both delivery system factors, including community and organizational capacity, and support system factors, training and technical assistance, facilitated implementation. Fidelity challenges include the availability of housing, consumer representation in program operations, and limitations to the array of services offered. Factors that accounted for these challenges include low vacancy rates, challenges of involving recently homeless people in program operations, and a lack of services in some of the communities. The study demonstrates how the combined use of fidelity assessment and qualitative methods can be used in implementation evaluation to develop and improve a program.

In this study, we investigated the relationship between gender and the relative importance of mental health service satisfaction domains to overall satisfaction, in addition to gender differences in satisfaction across domains. People receiving mental health services (1765 males and 1950 females) completed questionnaires regarding their overall service satisfaction and satisfaction along six domains: Access to Services, Quality and Appropriateness, Participation in Treatment Planning, Outcome of Services, Social Connectedness, and Functioning. While all were important to overall satisfaction across genders, women reported slightly higher overall satisfaction. Linear regression analyses were used to determine the relative importance of these subscales to overall satisfaction for each gender. While the correlations between each subscale and overall satisfaction were significant for both, gender was found to moderate the relationship between some subscales and overall satisfaction. Although predictive of overall service satisfaction across the sample, we found Functioning, Outcome of Services, Social Connectedness, and Access to Services were relatively more important to overall satisfaction for men than women. Consistent feedback of results and improved access to services may be particularly effective for engaging both men and women in treatment.

Through a dynamic process, this evaluation of the early phases of an initiative led to continuous program alterations based on feedback. The relationship of the evaluation team to the initiative's coordinating team enabled seamless transfer of observations, suggestions, and recommendations to decision makers. The multidisciplinary character of the evaluation team provided a diverse set of perspectives with a depth of subject matter and knowledge from relevant fields. One lesson is that developmental evaluators must be flexible, nimble, creative, and adaptive. When expected data are imperfect or nonexistent, the team must collect alternate information and make recommendations to improve data collection. As the initiative proceeded and modifications came about, the evaluation team had to recognize the changes in the program and focus on different questions. This experience with developmental evaluation provides insights into how interdisciplinary teams may need to change course and conduct a developmental evaluation when a formative evaluation was originally envisioned.

Alternative case management models have not been adequately explored. This study evaluates satisfaction with a novel group-intensive peer support (GIPS) model of case management for the Housing and Urban Development-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) program. A total of 95 HUD-VASH clients rated their satisfaction with services and responded to open-ended questions about what they liked best and least about the program. Quantitative and qualitative analyses compared clients who attended groups as part of the GIPS model and those who did not. No significant difference in satisfaction between group and non-group attenders were found. Clients reported what they liked best about the program was the staff; those who attended groups reported what they liked best was the social interaction and peer support. These findings suggest clients who attend groups for their primary source of case management may be as satisfied as those who receive only individual case management. GIPS offers a feasible and acceptable service model and should be further explored along with other alternative models of care in supportive housing services.

The Health-Promoting Church framework, developed collaboratively with faith-based partners, guided the intervention and a comprehensive process evaluation. The Health-Promoting Church components related to healthy eating and physical activity were getting the message out, opportunities, pastor support, and organizational policy. There was no evidence for sequential mediation for any of the healthy eating components. These results illustrate the complexity of systems change within organizational settings and the importance of conducting process evaluation. The FAN intervention resulted in increased implementation for all physical activity and most healthy eating components. Mediation analyses revealed no direct association between implementation and increased physical activity; rather, sequential mediation analysis showed that implementation of physical activity messages was associated with improved self-efficacy at the church level, which was associated with increased physical activity.

However, researchers know little about the specific evaluation activities occurring in these settings or the extent to which evaluators/service providers uphold FCS in their program evaluation activities. Through a questionnaire survey, this study aimed to document evaluators/service providers' perceptions of the level of program evaluation occurring in their Canadian pediatric rehabilitation centers. It also investigated the extent to which evaluators/service providers perceive program evaluation practices at their centers to be consistent with the FCS context of Canadian pediatric rehabilitation settings. The findings suggested that the amount of evaluation activities occurring within the respondents' centers is variable; that the majority of individuals working in program evaluation do not have formal training in it; and that the respondents' centers have limited resources for evaluation. The study also showed that staff members believe their centers' evaluation activities are somewhat consistent with FCS philosophy, but that improvements are needed.

A three-day Positive Prevention (PP) training intervention for health care providers that focused on pressing issues for PLHIV in Mozambique was adapted and delivered at sites in three provinces. In-depth interviews were conducted with 31 providers trained in the PP curriculum. Qualitative data were used to assess the appropriateness of the training materials and approach, which lessons providers learned and were able to implement and which PP messages were still difficult to deliver. Providers reported gaining numerous insights from the training, including how to conduct a risk assessment and client-centered counseling, negotiating disclosure, partner testing, condom use, PMTCT, treatment adherence and approaches for positive living. Training topics not commonly mentioned included discordance counseling, STIs, family planning, alcohol and drug use, and frank sexual risk discussions. While areas for improvement exist, the PP training was useful in transferring skills to providers and is a viable component of HIV care. This evaluation helps identify areas where future PP trainings and specific strategies and messages can be refined for the Mozambican context.

Data were gathered at four time points over a 2-year period from front-line mental health therapists (N=64) from 10 community-based agencies that participated in a DBT implementation initiative. We examined change on therapist attitudes toward consumers with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), confidence in the effectiveness of DBT, and use of DBT model components. All measures were self-report. Participating in DBT training was associated with positive changes over time, including improved therapist attitudes toward consumers with BPD, improved confidence in the effectiveness of DBT, and increased use of DBT components. Therapists who had the lowest baseline scores on the study outcomes had the greatest self-reported positive change in outcomes over time. Moreover, there were notable positive correlations in therapist characteristics; therapists who had the lowest baseline attitudes toward individuals with BPD, confidence in the effectiveness of DBT, or who were least likely to use DBT modes and components were the therapists who had the greatest reported increase over time in each respective area. DBT training with ongoing support resulted in changes not commonly observed in standard training approaches typically used in community settings. It is encouraging to observe positive outcomes in therapist self-reported skill, perceived self-efficacy and DBT component use, all of which are important to evidence-based treatment (EBT) implementation. Our results underscore the importance to recognize and target therapist diversity of learning levels, experience, and expertise in EBT implementation.

However, few validated measures assess this type of capacity. The YMCA commissioned a study to validate its Capacity Assessment for Youth Development Programming (Y-CAP), which examines the organizational infrastructure required to implement YD programs and processes in seven areas. Survey development was an iterative process informed by existing frameworks, instruments, and pilot testing of items. The Y-CAP was reviewed and revised three times prior to this study, with a final round of revisions made at the start of the validation phase as a result of thorough content, survey methodology, and psychometrics reviews. The revised Y-CAP was completed by 123 YMCA implementation teams. Rasch analyses were used to determine the extent to which validity evidence supports the use and interpretation of the Y-CAP scores. Convergent validity was assessed by comparing Y-CAP scales to the Algorhythm staff survey for youth-serving organizations, and focus groups informed the consequential validity of the Y-CAP. The results provide strong evidence for the reliability and validity of the Y-CAP, which can be used to guide continuous quality improvement initiatives that support capacity and functioning in youth-serving organizations and programs.

In the study, the cultural competence of the public administration students was analyzed. A total of 599 public administration students from twenty public and two foundation universities in eighteen different provinces of Turkey responded to a survey. The questionnaire survey was derived from a literature review; validated by exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The study proposes a CC evaluation model with five principal attributes: political awareness, civic action, belief in collective action, social justice attitudes, and ethical leadership. Accordingly, the model included 29 items that address all aspects of cultural competence. The model can be used to evaluate the CC level of public administration students. Besides, this model can also be applied in public organizations to evaluate their responsiveness to the public. Because public institutions today are supposed to be responsive to the cultural needs of citizens.

The measure is of a voluntary nature and its main aim is to prevent long-term unemployment among young people and to support a competitive ability of young school-leavers and thus their employability and sustainability in the labour market through the acquisition of work experience, professional skills and work habits. In the study, we analyse the selected characteristics of young jobseekers who participated in this measure in 2016 and their counterfactuals who did not participate. In addition to 2016, the observed period includes a subsequent 2 years - the individual impact period of the measure for each participant, i.e. the years 2017 and 2018. We evaluated the effects of the measure by applying the exact matching of treated and non-treated individuals using the outcome variables, namely wages and placement in the labour market in the impact period of the measure. The results indicate that the Graduate practice had a positive impact on the employability and sustainability of its participants, but rather in short-term or maximum long-term. Regarding the wage levels referring to the financial appraisal of the participants of the measure, the results suggest that non-treated individuals were better financially evaluated and so the Graduate practice did not guarantee better salary to its participants. The findings of the study are important in the setting of conditions of the measure for future periods in order to achieve its better functioning and efficiency in the way of proper targeting, more efficient use of funds, and for a system of their redistribution. Active labour market policy; Graduate practice; Evaluation; evolution of the SASA! approach to prevent violence against women One in three women globally will experience intimate partner violence (IPV) with devastating consequences for individual survivors, their families and communities. While prevalence remains high, violence against women is not inevitable and community mobilization approaches have emerged as particularly promising for transforming the gender inequitable norms and practices that underlie violence. The SASA! Activist Kit to Prevent Violence Against Women (SASA!), developed by Raising Voices in 2008, provides a theory-based approach for mobilizing communities to transform power imbalances between women and men through critical discussion and positive action. In this article, we provide the rational for revising SASA! after ten years of program learning and formal research. We aim to contribute to the knowledge base around what works to prevent IPV by describing the core enhancements in the revised version--called SASA! Together\u2014and linking these changes to Raising Voices' program learning and broader advancements in the field. In addition, we reflect on how current debates\u2014such as how best to \"scale up\" violence prevention programs\u2014were considered and resolved in SASA! Together. The paper concludes by sharing lessons learned that may provide guidance for future revisions development and revisions of evidenced-based programs.

A positive youth development approach was undertaken by the Boys and Girls Clubs of America to develop and implement a Military Teen Ambassadors (MTA) training for youth in military families that would facilitate knowledge of resiliency and reintegration and foster leadership skills to build assets for themselves as well as their peers within their local communities. To determine if MTA was functioning as intended and to refine future programming, this preliminary formative study assessed perceived participant learning outcomes associated with MTA on variables pertaining to knowledge acquisition, perceived skill acquisition, and community needs awareness. Data were collected prior to the training, immediately following the training, and 6 months after the training. Repeated measures analysis indicated significant mean increases over time in knowledge and awareness of resiliency and reintegration; perceived leadership skills; and community awareness. Qualitative findings provided triangulation in the aforementioned areas. These findings strengthen the body of knowledge on resiliency by demonstrating that the 7 Cs model may be an effective strategy to incorporate into leadership development programs seeking to build knowledge of resiliency among military youth.

Yet methods for collecting and analyzing data on unintended outcomes remain under-utilized. Ripple Effects Mapping (REM) is a promising qualitative evaluation method with a wide range of program planning and evaluation applications. In situations where program results are likely to occur over time within complex settings, this method is useful for uncovering both intended and unintended outcomes. REM applies an Appreciative Inquiry facilitation technique to engage stakeholders in visually mapping sequences of program outcomes. Although it has been used to evaluate community development and health promotion initiatives, further methodological guidance for applying REM is still needed. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the methodological development of evaluating unintended outcomes and extend the foundations of REM by describing steps for integrating it with grounded theory.

However, the daily intake of these food and drink items falls below recommended standards among Mexican adults, posing a high risk of non-communicable diseases such as overweight and obesity across all age groups in the country. The objective of this article is to describe the design, implementation and evaluation of an educational initiative conducted in a Mexican locality with the aim of promoting the consumption of fruits, vegetables (FVs) and simple water (SW) among preschoolers through the influence of their mothers and teachers. We used the Intervention Mapping methodology with qualitative and quantitative components. Mothers attended eight theoretical and practical sessions and two school meetings, while teachers were offered two workshops. Our results revealed positive changes among both groups: participants took greater interest in healthy nutrition, increased their purchase, preparation and intake of FVs and SW and promoted their consumption. This confirms that it is possible to achieve favorable changes in eating habits among those who participate in educational initiatives in Mexico. Intervention Mapping; Health promotion; Obesity prevention; Fruit and vegetable programs: A look at inter-organizational mentoring strategies Community-based non-profit organizations rarely have access to research or evaluation evidence to inform their programs and often lack the capacity to gather or use this information independently. In 2016, Wisdom2Action\u2014a network of knowledge mobilization (KMb) experts, policy makers and service providers across Canada\u2014launched an inter-organizational mentorship program to facilitate the implementation and sharing of best and promising practices within community-based programs for young people. This article outlines the findings from a developmental evaluation of eight mentoring relationships. Drawing on the Promoting Action on Research in Health Sciences (PARiHS) model of KMb, we look at mentoring as a type of facilitation that supports the increased use of evidence and evaluation information by non-profit organizations and identify key themes that support effective organizational mentorship in this sector. Findings reinforce the importance of establishing connected relationships and understanding context in mentoring relationships, creating adaptive and responsive work plans, ensuring consistent communication, and maintaining a focus on capacity-building if knowledge mobilization is to occur. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149718918301770 Laura Lagace, Marie Claude oai:RePEc:eee:epplan:v:76:y:2019:i:c:82019-10-06RePEc:eee:epplan article A logic model development for an adolescent based intervention to improve benefits from Therapeutic Residential Care (TRC) There is a significant need to comprehensively describe and illustrate via a logic model what processes work for adolescents in residential treatment facilities and how to make improvements (Bean, White, Neagle & Lake, 2005).The purpose of this article is to highlight one Adolescent TRC's journey to develop and implement a working Logic Model.

This paper describes the development of an educational intervention for the promotion of healthy eating and physical activity among two-to-four-year-old children in public child care centers (CCCs) in Mexico City. Following the Intervention Mapping (IM) protocol, we developed the Bright Futures multidisciplinary intervention. First, a formative research process to identify the personal and environmental determinants of childhood overweight and obesity, behavioral outcomes and performance objectives was conducted. Then, a matrix of change objectives by intersecting the performance objectives with the determinants was integrated. Bright Futures lasted six months and included 24 weekly sessions, each composed of five phases: warm-up, theory, active movements, relaxation, and hydration. Ad hoc interactive teaching materials focused on recreational activities, and formulated plans for the adoption, implementation and process/impact evaluation of the intervention was developed. IM successfully guided the design of a theory-driven and evidence-based intervention for children in CCCs within a socio-ecological and participatory planning framework. This is one of the first studies in Mexico to use IM in the context of CCCs.

The implementation of CJ in two public health care centers (HCC) in Chile's Metropolitan Region was assessed based on Donabedian's theoretical model, focusing on the dimensions of the program's structure (e.g., infrastructure and supplies), processes (e.g., coordination of CJ team with the HCCs, participants' attendance, CJ team interaction with participating children), and preliminary outcomes (i.e., parenting stress, caregiver-child interaction). A total of 63 main caregiver-child dyads participated in the study, which took place over a six-month period. Results indicated that the CJ program was feasible to be implemented in two HCCs and would benefit from improving the coordination with the HCCs and the quality of interaction of the CJ team with participating children. After participation in the CJ program, caregivers showed a decrease in their parenting stress. Lessons learned are discussed.

This logic consists of four parts: (1) establish criteria, (2) set standards, (3) measure performance on criteria and compare to standards, and (4) synthesize into a value judgment. Nearly three-fourths (71.84% \u00b1 5.98%) of AEA members are unfamiliar with this logic, yet a majority also indicate its importance and utility for evaluation practice. Moreover, and despite unfamiliarity with the four steps of the logic of evaluation, many AEA members identify evaluative criteria (82.41% \u00b1 3.34%), set standards (62.14% into an evaluative conclusion (75.00% \u00b1 5.80%) in their evaluation practice.

A subsector of the population vulnerable to inactivity is college students. There is a disconnect between evidence-based physical activity programming and dissemination into college communities, which may be overcome through logic model development and evaluation. The purpose of this paper is to discuss logic model development for a service-learning, dog walking program for undergraduates. Participants were undergraduates (18-25 years). Process evaluations and observational data were used in a content analysis to determine major themes to create the logic model. A set of resources were needed to complete program activities, which led to short- and long-term outcomes. The overarching goal of the program is to improve the overall health status of college students and companion animals. This logic model may have significant public health impact as it can serve as a framework for universities wanting to develop, implement, and evaluate a service-learning, dog walking program for students.

However, these individuals may lack the time and, for some, the required expertise to search for and identify such interventions. To address this concern, several online registers that list or categorize programs according to their empirical evidence of effectiveness have been established. Although these registers are designed to simplify the task of selecting evidence-based interventions, the use of distinct review processes and standards by each register creates discrepancies in final program classifications, which can pose a challenge for users. The present case study highlights three programs that have been evaluated by more than one register and have received similar or different classifications. Reasons for inconsistencies are discussed, and several recommendations for evaluating organizations and register users are provided to enhance the functionality and ease of use of online program registers.

This includes documentation of the extent to which programmes are compatible with the basic views of providers and their local practices. The present study explores the Svendborgproject - a programme tripling the amount of physical education in six public schools, sustaining it for 10-years and documenting a decreased incidence of overweight, obesity and cardiovascular risk factors. The aim was to analyse provider and programme characteristics of the Svendborgproject to gain insights into providers motives for adopting, implementing, and maintaining the programme. Six school heads and six teachers were interviewed to explore how they perceived programme compatibility to their school's practice and their own role as providers. Both teachers and school heads found the additional lessons a valuable asset that fitted existing school values and priorities. Additionally, physical education teachers participated in a course providing new perspectives and teaching methods that aided the implementation of the programme. Lastly, school heads stressed that implementation fidelity was heavily dependent on the dedication of physical education teachers and on having simple programme requirements that made it clear what could be expected of the programme.

Current literature offers little with respect to the use of CBPR and DE in combination, although the two approaches are complementary. Through the current paper, we outline how CBPR and DE were used to develop a model of supportive housing for teen families. More specifically, we describe the structures and processes that contributed to this development, including (1) our partnership approach, (2) pooled resources, (3) regular opportunities for collaboration and reflection, (4) integration of multiple data sources, (5) ongoing feedback and knowledge dissemination, and (6) adjustments to program practices. We end by providing insights into the lessons that we learned through this project. Through this paper, we describe how researchers and community partners can collaboratively use CBPR and DE to develop a program model in complex community settings.

To better understand long-term gains from job skills training, this study compared employment and earnings trajectories between program participants who received job skills training and those who received basic services only. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, we estimated 33-year employment and earnings trajectories among U.S. baby-boomer cohorts while accounting for baseline group heterogeneity using inverse propensity score weighting. We found increases in employment rates over the life course, especially among Black women. Job skills training also increased earnings by up to 69.6 % compared to basic services only. Despite the long-term gains in employment and earnings, job skills training participation is not sufficient to address gender as well as racial and ethnic gaps in full-time employment. Findings reinforce the importance of incorporating job skills training as an essential service element of government-sponsored employment programs to improve long-term labor market outcomes among Americans with economic disadvantages.

This study examined the relationship between student- and school- characteristics and different implementation parameters of \"Active All Year Round\", a nationwide Danish school-based physical activity program. The study is based on data from multiple sources: questionnaire data from students from 16 fifth-grade school classes (n = 276) and their teachers (n = 16), in-class observations (n = 15) and register data. Predictors included the student-level characteristics of gender, family affluence, immigration background, and perception of school connectedness as well as the school-level characteristics of school size, school parental education level, school physical activity policy and school's prioritization of health promotion. Implementation was assessed by creating an implementation score from data on program psychological reach, dose delivered, dose received and fidelity. Data were analyzed by multilevel linear regression analysis. Findings indicated that the program was more easily implemented for students with higher school connectedness. To conclude, school-based health promotion programs can be improved by knowing, before the program is implemented, which factors increase the odds of better implementation.

The purpose of this study is to identify, assess and synthesise the facilitators and barriers to sustainably implementing evidence-based health innovations in a low- and middle-income country (LMIC) context. To identify the LMIC specific facilitators and barriers, a systematic literature review was conducted. 79 studies were analysed, and the implementation barriers and facilitators identified in each study were extracted. The extracted barriers and facilitators were categorised and synthesized into one of seven concepts: context, innovation, relations and networks, institutions, knowledge, actors or resources.

For effective interprofessional discharge planning, the evaluation that clarifies the differences in assessment viewpoints between various healthcare professionals is needed. This study aimed to clarify the assessment viewpoints of multiple healthcare professional groups when discharging patients from a long-term care hospital (LTCH) to home. We reviewed 102 medical records from an LTCH in Japan, extracted descriptions of discharge planning assessments written by 3 doctors, 13 nurses, 3 physical therapists, 13 care workers, and 2 social workers, linked these to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, and conducted the statistical analysis. Doctors and nurses significantly focused on \"Body Functions\". Physical therapists and care workers significantly focused on \"Activities and Participation\". Social workers significantly focused on \"Environmental Factors\". We also identified the factors less or missing from assessments in the clinical field of the LTCH. Our findings could be contributed as a base of knowledge to foster a better understanding of different healthcare professionals' assessment viewpoints. The further development of comprehensive discharge planning assessment tools, service programs, and research on discharge planning methods that could contribute to effective interprofessional discharge planning is needed.

Results indicated that parents who participated did increase both their parental self-efficacy in regard to influencing their child's school-related performance and helping their child succeed in school. Qualitatively, parents also reported the parent education was helpful and that they had tried suggested interventions at home. Though a small-scale pilot project, results are promising and suggest parent education is a feasible technique school districts can use to reach parents of students with EBD.

In early 2020, the US Peace Corps/Georgia office commissioned a retrospective evaluation of these projects. The key evaluation questions were: 1) To what degree were SPA Program projects successful in achieving the SPA Program objectives over the ten years, 2) To what extent can the achieved outcomes be attributed to the SPA Program's interventions, and 3) How can the SPA Program be improved to increase likelihood of success of future projects.

We discuss theory-driven evaluation applied to a community-based intervention implemented by Dancing With Parkinson's in Toronto, Canada, targeting Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative condition affecting movement. A major gap in the literature is understanding the mechanisms by which dance might make a difference in the daily lives of people living with PD. This study was an early exploratory evaluation to better understand mechanisms and short-term outcomes. Conventional thinking generally favors \"permanent\" over \"transitory\" changes, and \"long-term\" over \"short-term\" effects. Yet, for people living with degenerative conditions (and also people experiencing chronic pain and other chronic symptoms), transitory and short-term changes may be highly valued and welcomed relief. In order to study and link multiple longitudinal events to explore key linkages in the theory of change, we piloted the use of diaries, with brief entries filled out daily by participants. The aim was to better understand the short-term experiences of participants using their daily routines as a means of learning about potential mechanisms, what matters to participants, and to see if small effects could be observed on days when participants danced versus days when they did not dance and also longitudinally over several months. Our initial theoretical stance began with a view of dance as exercise and the well-established benefits of exercise; yet, we explored through the diary data collected, as well as client interviews and literature review, potential other mechanisms of dancing (such as group interaction, touch, stimulation by the music, and esthetics including \"feeling lovely\"). This paper does not develop a full, comprehensive theory of dance but moves towards a more comprehensive view that locates dance within the routine activities of participants' daily lives. We argue that given the challenges of evaluating complex interventions comprising multiple, interacting components, there is a need for an evolutionary learning process to understand heterogeneities in mechanisms -- what works for whom -- when faced with knowledge incompleteness in the theory of change.

Organizations involved must address this issue by providing supportive infrastructures. Among the elements to consider are competency drivers, which refer to the selection, training, and supervision of caseworkers. The purpose of this study was to describe the perspectives of caseworkers and representatives on competency drivers that organizations put in place to support the implementation of early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) in large-scale community-based services. The sample consisted of 109 caseworkers and 23 organization representatives who completed questionnaires. Results demonstrated that respondents consider clinical support and training as key elements in EIBI implementation. However, despite recognizing these factors, respondents reported considerable variability in practices. It appears necessary to better define and plan the implementation of these competency drivers with a view to improving EIBI implementation. Early intensive behavioral intervention; Implementation; Training; Supervision; impact of Master's programmes in development studies: Insights from a mixed-methods and multicultural alumni action research project To understand the impact of the international Master's programmes offered at the Institute of Development Policy (University of Antwerp), a theory-based evaluation was undertaken. In the first phase, a Theory of Change (ToC) was elaborated, distinguishing between three levels of impact (individual, organisational and societal), four learning dimensions (knowledge, skills, attitudes and networks) and five implicit pathways (change agent, social network, widening access, academic diversity, international understanding). Given the multifaceted and vague nature of the 'impact' concept under study, we selected an international, gender-balanced, multi-sectoral team of alumni researchers who fostered inclusiveness of different perspectives, at the same time capitalising on their depth of understanding, having gone through the study experience themselves. A mixed-methods approach was adopted to validate the ToC, combining a Most Significant Change approach, categorisation and text analysis of 101 alumni impact stories. Our findings demonstrate the importance of the three levels of impact and four learning dimensions in capturing graduate impact. While the impact stories confirmed the dominant 'change agent' pathway, they also hinted at the importance of hybrid complementary configurations of pathways to fully grasp how impact materialises.

Yet, there are key gaps in knowledge about the dynamics of the utilization of these programs, with scant attention paid to examining the duration of homelessness prevention and RRH service episodes or to patterns of repeated use of these programs over time. To address these gaps, we use data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) program\u2014the largest program in the country providing homelessness prevention and RRH services\u2014to assess the relationship between individual and program-level factors and exits to stable housing, length of service episodes, and patterns of repeated service use over time. We analyze data for a primary cohort of 570, 798 of Veterans who received SSVF services during Fiscal Years (FY) 2012-2021, and for separate cohorts of Veterans who received SSVF prevention and RRH services, respectively, during FY 2016-2021. We find that participants' income, indicators of their health status, their use of other VA homeless programs, and rurality are consistent predictors of our outcomes. These findings have implications for how to allocate homelessness prevention and RRH resources in the most efficient manner to help households maintain or obtain stable housing.

The program, an Australia Awards South and West Asia (AASWA) short course, delivered by an Australian university, was designed to build on the existing capacity of the participants to lead the implementation of inclusive education reforms and system enhancements within the school system in Nepal. Data collected before, during and after the program provide insights into the ways in which participants responded to the program. Our findings indicate that a deep understanding of context is needed by program planners to identify how and why particular mechanisms are triggered that lead to transformative learning of the participants. We suggest that backward mapping as a methodology is a viable realist evaluation process to evaluate complex programs such as the short-term international aid program on IE. Our paper concludes with recommendations for developers of similar programs in the future.

The ambition of this paper is to bridge this gap between evaluators and proponents of alternative indicators, by highlighting how an approach dedicated to the construction of alternative indicators can support evaluation practice. To do so, we draw on a participatory project conducted in Grenoble (France), that focused on the construction of indicators of sustainable wellbeing (IBEST). The project and its outputs have been used to support three evaluations over the past five years, which were each conducted with the aim of challenging policy objectives and evaluating interventions in terms of their contribution to the wellbeing of local people. Our results show that the work carried out within the framework of this type of project can feed into every stage of an evaluation. It is therefore in the interest of evaluators to integrate these alternative indicator approaches into evaluation. Moreover, this enrichment of evaluation could be useful in other places that have developed or wish to develop wellbeing indicators to support alternative policy making. Transformative evaluation; Wellbeing; Alternative process evaluation of an ergonomic train the trainer program: How to learn from mechanisms and the temporal structure of processes? In implementation process evaluation, the analysis of the temporal structure of processes is key for understanding the successive interactions between the flow of practitioners' actions and evolving workplace reactions and context. However, capturing the temporal structure of processes in data analysis is a methodological challenge, and available literature to overcome this challenge is scarce, especially for workplace ergonomic interventions. The aim of this paper was to perform an implementation process evaluation of an ergonomic train the trainer program taking into account the temporal structure of processes. We provided a method for qualitative data analysis based on a three-stage strategy: 1) producing the timeline of the implemented intervention, 2) identifying influential factors, 3) identifying determinant mechanisms (sequence of influential factors that intervened in the implementation process). This method allowed us to identify six determinant mechanisms positioned on the timeline of the intervention. Obstacles and levers were identified as a sequence of interrelated causes and consequences rather than isolated factors. We recommended success strategies for practitioners, while also shedding light on how organizations can better be prepared to undertake the intervention and their required actions to attain targeted intervention objectives.

This article reports on our efforts to document the success of agricultural aid interventions. The study is focused on evaluating cacao projects in Colombia, specifically on assessing the success of the rural Productive Partnerships Project (PAAP). The two approaches used to assess the project's success included the degree of accomplishment of four of the PAAP project's objectives and a measurement of the project performance at the local level, for which an existing performance index was utilized. Quantitative data were obtained from the project's evaluation platform developed by the PAAP project coordinators. Based on our first evaluation approach, we found that the four project objectives evaluated were not fully accomplished. While our results using the performance index provide baseline data for upcoming work assessing cacao projects' performance, the absence of precedent information constrained its interpretation. Finally, the paper offers feasible, affordable, and practical recommendations that could benefit future program planning and evaluation of international aid interventions, particularly on cacao projects worldwide.

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration operationalizes TIC through six key principles: 1) safety, 2) transparency and trustworthiness, 3) peer support, 4) collaboration, 5) empowerment and, 6) sensitivity to cultural, gender, and historical issues (SAMSHA, 2014). However, there has been little attention paid to how these principles should be operationalized in the context of evaluation. This methodological article first identifies the need for evaluation of TIC programs to mirror the core principles of TIC and then offers specific strategies for conducting research and evaluation in accordance with them. The goal of this work is to define a set of principles for research and evaluation that utilizes the process to reinforce key tenets of TIC and enhance trauma treatment.

The existing gap between the traditional literatura reviews and previous bibliometric studies, is covered as it is the first comprehensive analysis carried out in applying quantity, quality, and structural indicators. Web of Science Core Collection was used as the source of information, considering it the most accurate and suitable data base for these studies. This research covers the wider period-of-time possible, from 1992 to 2020, with a final sample of 771 articles in 466 reviews. Quantity indicators show the high interest that the BSC still has in the scholar's community, pointing out Kaplan and Norton as the most productive authors, and confirming that 'management', 'business' and 'accountability' are its most common field of activity, although others as 'systems' and sustainability' are coming to prominence; 'Balanced Scorecard' appears as the most remarkable keyword. Quality indicators found 32, 706 citations, with Kaplan and Norton occupying again top positions as well as 'Harvard Business Review' as the most impacting review both in cited articles and in average.

For this purpose, the Pyramid method is first adapted to the Turkish Preschool Education Program by authors after studying the method in the Netherlands for about two months. Then a study was conducted in a private preschool in Ankara, Turkey with a total of 44 children. We collected the data using the 'Turkish version of Test of Early Language and Development' and 'Early Literacy Skills Assessment Tool'. Data was then analyzed using Wilcoxon Signed Rank and Kruskal Wallis-H Tests. Results of the study show that the Pyramid method adapted to the Turkish Pre-School Education Program has positive effects on 5-year-old children's language skills and phonological awareness, print awareness, story comprehension, visual matching, and pre-writing skills. These findings are in agreement with similar studies of the Pyramid Method in different countries.

This review paper summarizes a decade of findings (2007-2017) from the NY/NY III evaluation team, to analyze this program's impact on various housing and health outcomes. The evaluation team linked NY/NY III eligible persons with administrative data from two years pre- and two years post-eligibility and compared housing and health outcomes between placed and unplaced groups using propensity score analysis. Placement into NY/NY III housing was associated with improved physical and mental health outcomes, increased housing stability, and statistically significant cost savings per person after one year of placement. The evaluation team recommends that municipalities invest in supportive housing as a means for mitigating homelessness and improving health outcomes in this vulnerable population.

This introductory paper reviews some of the critical challenges that arise in developing and learning from theory-driven evaluations. These challenges include the relationship between theories of change and ecologies of evidence, the need for epistemic fluency in learning, and coming to terms with the initial incompleteness of knowledge in program mechanisms. The nine papers that follow, which represent a geographically diverse set of evaluations and evaluators (including Scotland, India, Canada, USA), help develop these and other themes. This volume of papers also serves as a celebration of the work of John Mayne, one of the foremost theory-driven evaluators of the last few decades. John passed away in December of 2020.

COVID-19 information from the government may influence the public's information-seeking behavior regarding OFD services. Thus, exploring the relationship between contactless OFD and consumer perceptions of the government response during the pandemic is essential. This paper probed the effects exerted by three behavioral beliefs, namely health consciousness, self-efficacy, and perceived benefits, on consumers' intention and attitude toward contactless online food delivery (OFD) services. This study explored the moderating impact exerted by perceived government response to the COVID-19 pandemic on the relationship between attitude and intention toward OFD services. The study results indicated that self-efficacy and perceived benefits positively influenced the respondents' attitude toward contactless OFD services. Health consciousness negatively influenced their attitude toward these services. The respondents' attitude toward contactless OFD services to be positively related to their behavioral intention toward such services.

The aim of this study was to explore capacity outcomes in five dimensions - resources, infrastructure, knowledge and skills, culture and climate, and engagement and partnership - achieved by child welfare jurisdictions who received Center services. Analyses describe the capacities targeted for improvement and the amount and type of services provided by Centers; assess the relationship between services and capacity increase; and explore whether that relationship differs depending on the jurisdiction's level of foundational capacity. Data collected through surveys and a service delivery tracking system reflect the perspectives of service recipients and service providers. Results reveal jurisdictions typically targeted capacity outcomes in the dimensions of knowledge and skills and infrastructure and received an average of 28 hours of direct services to support their capacity-building efforts. Dosage of service was positively associated with achievement of capacity outcomes, though no interaction was found between service dosage and foundational capacity in the effect on outcomes.

Healthcare infrastructure and healthcare services, including their accessibility, belong to objective factors influencing their perception of their health. The growing disparity between supply and demand for specialized inpatient facilities due to the aging population calls for new solutions, including eHealth technologies. Automatized activities could be taken over by eHealth technologies that do not require a constant presence of staff. We tested whether eHealth technical solutions reduce patients' health risks on a sample of 61 patients on the covid-19 unit in Tomas Bata hospital in Zlin. We have applied the randomized control trial to select patients for the treatment and the control groups. Moreover, we tested eHealth technologies and their help to staff in the hospital. Due to the severity of the covid-19 disease and its rapid course and the size of the sample in our research, we did not demonstrate a statistically significant impact of eHealth technologies on patient health. The evaluation results confirm that even the limited number of technologies deployed proves to be an effective help for staff in critical situations like the pandemic. The main issue is psychological support to staff in hospitals and relieving stressful work.

This paper presents a practical approach to embedded evaluation that can be used by services to interrogate assumptions about relationships. The approach includes a simple framework for developing theories of change that centres relational aspects of the change process. This framework is complemented by a structured approach to surfacing risks and assumptions. Using the example of the evaluation of Future Pathways, a new and ground breaking service provided to people who experienced abuse or neglect as children In Care in Scotland, the paper describes how this approach was used in practice. Focusing in on assumptions identified by the service around trust, the paper describes the process undertaken to interrogate these assumptions through data collection with people using the service and staff. This process led to rich learning to support the development of the service as well as the identification of new elliptical assumptions. The paper concludes by sharing reflections on the learning from this work for the wider evaluation community highlighting the need for evaluators to take a relational approach to interrogating assumptions about relationships.

Ambulatory outpatient alcohol use disorder treatment has been clinically shown to increase abstinence, which could decrease the chance of subsequent DWI offences. Aiding clients in successful completion of this treatment is imperative to lower the recidivism rates of DWI offenses. The research question focused on if employment status can predict successful outpatient treatment completion in court mandated adults. The TEDS-D archival data set was used, consisting of data collected between 2006\u20142011 from federally funded substance abuse treatment centers throughout the USA. The variables of treatment level, gender, employment status, and age were used as controls.

Its main objective is to uncover the mechanisms that lead to observed outcomes following an intervention and the contextual conditions that enabled this. The focus is on explaining why, for whom and in what circumstances an intervention works. It is a theory-driven approach and is explicitly method neutral, meaning that both quantitative and qualitative data collection methods can be used to unearth the underlying mechanisms that cause the intervention outcomes. In this review, we aim to map the methods used in realist evaluation studies, to draw lessons from the findings and to reflect on ways forward. We found that qualitative methods and interviews specifically are most commonly used in realist evaluations; that theory is often absent behind the methods and sampling techniques used; and that more innovative methods remain underexplored. We conclude the review by proposing four ways forward: (1) developing realist surveys, (2) exploring the relevance of innovative methods, (3) increasing the attention paid to sampling procedures and (4) strengthening the theory-driven nature of method. We believe that these four action points can strengthen the practice of realist evaluation and its outcomes.

It was hypothesized that participants would experience a decline in type 2 diabetes symptoms following the 12-month program of bi-monthly healthy groceries, nutritional guidance, educational sessions, and group health coaching. For this initial pilot study, four cohorts of patients were admitted consisting of 20 participants. The 12-month program included bi-monthly food pick-ups, nutritional recipes, and bi-monthly group educational and health coaching sessions for participants. They also completed pre- and post-program assessments, including a medical history questionnaire, biometric screening (HbA1c, weight, BMI, and blood pressure), and health behavior questionnaires. While there were not statistically significant differences from pre- to post-program, mean HbA1c slightly decreased from the time of the initial test (i.e., month 1) to follow-up testing (i.e., month 12). The pre- to post-program trends for diabetes self-care activities indicated improvements for general and specific diet maintenance, days of exercise per week, blood glucose testing per week, foot care, and smoking habits. Participants also exhibited a decrease in diabetes distress for emotional, physical, regimen, and interpersonal distress from pre- to post-program. This is very important as self-regulation of behaviors is necessary to successful management of diabetes. The results are discussed in relation to the limitations created by COVID-19, along with future implementation suggestions.

However, studies have yet to explore the essential competencies required by evaluation capacity builders working in the community sector. Our qualitative study aimed to examine the perceptions of ECB practitioners (n = 12) regarding essential competencies for building evaluation capacity in this sector. Our findings reveal that ECB practice requires competencies not found in known evaluation competency frameworks, such as instructional design, knowledge of organizational change models, motivating stakeholders, and understanding of the community sector. Our findings provide valuable information to help guide future education and training related to building the evaluation capacity of community organizations.

Those who received higher levels of gender-sensitive treatment were expected to better offset treatment costs through greater reductions in subsequent service costs and economic assistance, and greater increases in earned income. Compared to the 24 months preceding treatment, archival data from state databases showed that use of health and criminal justice services, and receipt of economic assistance, actually increased during the 24 months following treatment, and that earned income decreased, resulting in unexpectedly negative net benefits, i.e., a net loss, from a taxpayer perspective. More gender-sensitive treatment was less costly per participant, however, making the net loss less for persons receiving more gender-sensitive treatment. Alternative explanations for these findings are explored, including utilization of archival records of service use rather than the more bias-sensitive self-reports of service use that others have examined previously. The importance of evaluating nonmonetary, as well as monetary, outcomes of substance use disorder (SUD) treatment is noted as well.

A quasi-experimental design of repeated measures pretest-posttest with a control group was used. The sample consisted of 137 university students (67.9% women, with a mean age of 19.94 years). Participants were randomly assigned to the experimental group (n = 69) and the control group (n = 68). Results showed that the program stimulated a significant improvement in dispositional mindfulness, describing, non-reactivity, trait emotional intelligence, mental health and emotional confusion in the experimental group. Given the obtained results, we consider the importance and incorporation of these mindfulness-based programs in university students. Due to the general characteristics of this population, having resources that lead to improvements, such as those obtained in this study, can be of great help since, in general, we find ourselves in a context, the university, in which students are subject to high levels of stress and anxiety.

We estimate the treatment effects of two R&D financial support activities using a semiparametric efficient estimator with over-identified moment conditions and inverse probability weighting. The impact assessment uses population data on small and medium-sized enterprises in Estonia, the European Union member state that benefits most per capita from Cohesion Fund allocations. We found that support for R&D and innovation from the Cohesion Policy had a positive short-term effect on labour productivity and employment over the estimation period 2014-2018, and that the size and robustness of the effect were strongest for labour productivity. The short-term effect on exporting was ambiguous.

Information collected through a specific survey allowed to build a dataset with more than 350 observations. Regressors were carefully selected and compared through a radar chart. The estimation of a logistic model was then carried out. The results outlined the relevant factors for patient satisfaction: they depend both on the ambulatory where the care is provided and the judgement about quality of care. Other crucial factors in determining a higher satisfaction were the availability of parking lots, the cleaning of structures and the judgment on physicians, the latter endorsing the probability of being highly satisfied when expectations on physicians' competences and professionalism are confirmed. The \"Contact details\", i.e., the indications of the people to contact in case of need, strengthen the overall patients' positive experience. The study enriches the existing literature on patient satisfaction and is aimed at rethinking the organization of the health assistance offered at University Polyclinics, outlining the aspects to improve, with the objective to guarantee the highest patient satisfaction.

This article reviews the use of data in nonprofit organizations, including the types of data collected and accessed, the motivations for data capture, and the barriers to systematic use of data. The literature shows that nonprofit organizations capture a variety of data, including public and financial data, performance measures, program evaluation data, and volunteer information. Organizations use these with diverse motivations such as program or organizational improvement, marketing, and accountability. Prominent barriers faced by organizations include challenges in identifying meaningful information, lack of technical ability, inability to prioritize data work, as well as external influences. The article highlights the challenges in synthesizing the available literature, with a high degree of fragmentation, including research from distinct intellectual traditions resulting in many disconnected constructs, measurements, and theories. Finally, the paper discusses challenges in the study of nonprofit data use and strives to provide guidance for future inquiry.

As resources are often limited, evaluators must carefully choose methods that yield the best information for their particular program. A concern with FGDs and IIs is how well they elicit information on potentially sensitive topics; very little is known about differences in disclosure by methodology in the domain of justice. Using FGDs (n = 16) and IIs (n = 46) from a USAID project in Haiti, we systematically coded responses based on a shared elicitation guide around access to and engagement with the formal and informal justice systems and performed thematic and statistical comparisons across the two methods. We introduce the continuous thought as the novel standard unit for statistical comparison. Participants in IIs were statistically more likely to provide themes relevant to genderbased violence. Importantly, sensitive themes extracted in IIs (e.g., related to sexual violence, economic dimensions, and restorative justice) did not emerge in FGDs. Given these results and other limitations to the FGD, prioritizing interviews over focus group modalities may be appropriate to guide targeted, effective programming on justice or other socially sensitive topics.

We conducted multigroup latent class analysis using significant individual risk factors. Our sample included 13, 453 opioid treatment episodes from 135 unique substance use disorder treatment programs in Los Angeles County, California, in four waves: 2011 (66 programs, 1035 clients), 2013 (77 programs, 3671 clients), 2015 (75 programs, 4625 clients), and 2017 (69 programs, 4106 clients). Groups at risk of waiting longer included clients who were female, had mental health issues, received medication for OUD, had criminal justice involvement, received mandated referrals, had children in child protective services, and had caretaker responsibilities. All clients with children in protective services were likely to wait longer than those not in protective services, but women waited longer. Findings highlight that: (a) women and men in OUD treatment have significant health and social problems; (b) female and male clients have distinct risk profiles; and (c) targeted services responding to risk profiles may improve treatment access and engagement. Findings have implications for health policy and program evaluation and planning in the delivery of treatment services considering gendered risk factors.

However, there is a lack of in-depth knowledge about how smoking practices and rules about smoking actually change over time. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine how smoking practices changed during a three-year period in which a smoking preventive intervention with strict anti-smoking rules was implemented at schools.

We developed a 12-session blended e-learning intervention for youth involved in juvenile justice systems to encourage healthy sexual decision-making by improving self-regulation skills. This paper describes the development of the program, e-Practice Self-Regulation, as well as an assessment of program acceptability and perceived effectiveness among youth participants. Data were collected using a feedback survey from youth who both completed (n = 95) and did not complete (n = 80) the intervention. Program acceptability was high among all participants, and over 70 % of both completers and non-completers would recommend e-Practice Self-Regulation to peers. Youth reported positive interactions with facilitators and described sessions as helpful, interesting, and educational. The most common criticism was online session length. A majority in both groups reported perceived effectiveness related to sexual health and self-regulation, which increased with more sessions completed. Results suggest e-Practice Self-Regulation is acceptable to youth participants, who reported learning skills necessary for self-regulation and sexual health and intended to use these skills to avoid unplanned pregnancy.

This paper articulates a conceptual framework and describes survey scales for measuring buy-in. The paper applies the framework and survey to a program evaluation of an effort implementing the early college model in 16 high schools. The paper empirically connects teacher buy-in to perceptions of program implementation. In our main regression analysis, we found a significant relationship between teacher buy-in and model implementation. Through a dominance analysis, we also found that items related to collective buy-in were stronger predictors of implementation than items measuring individual buy-in. Our results suggest that it is important to measure both individual and collective buy-in because both are predictive of implementation. The survey items and framework presented could be of use to evaluators through modification for use in implementation studies of other program evaluations. PreK-12 education; Quantitative methods; M.

An ecological conceptual framework was used to examine barriers and facilitators to implementing social and health care services from the perspective of the professionals involved at the national, state, and local level of government. A single case study following a qualitative research strategy was conducted with a total of 29 professionals from social development and health ministries, one municipality and a family health center responsible for implementing the Chile Grows with You system. The results show that at the national level, the main factors include socio-political aspects, funding, and the empathy that professional employees hold for peers who are at lower rungs in the hierarchy. At the state level workplace conditions play a key role. For the local level those factors include information system management and the political support of the local government. The discussion section emphasizes the relevance of considering the interdependence of such factors that influence implementation outcomes and the need to move away from a single program evaluation to a multilevel implementation analysis of public policy.

This study aimed to determine the appropriateness of a novel exercise training program for wheelchair users with MS. Ten wheelchair users with MS were recruited from a previous cross-sectional research study to attend one of three focus groups with 3-4 participants that lasted between 69 and 87 min. The focus groups were conducted online using a semi-structured format and participants were invited to complete an evaluation survey. During the focus groups, participants provided qualitative feedback regarding the exercise prescription, exercise modes (resistance and aerobic), training manual, exercise equipment, fitness tracker, rating scale, newsletters, logbook, and coaching. Most feedback focused on minor considerations such as avoiding the color red as it can be an issue for individuals with optic neuritis. Among quantitative evaluation survey ratings, coaching calls were rated the highest 4.7 \u00b1 0.4 on a 5-point scale, followed by the exercise prescription (4.4 \u00b1 0.8) and fitness tracker (4.3 \u00b1 0.9). Focus group participants provided invaluable feedback for finalizing a novel exercise training program for wheelchair users with MS and provided focal suggestions for further improvements.

This paper describes and illustrates the surfacing of \"elliptical assumptions, \" which involve the unknown ingredients that are necessary for a program to be effective. Identifying the ingredients of program success is important for several reasons, which include (a) guiding the development of an improved theory of change, which in turn can guide program improvement, and (b) informing efforts to transfer the program to other settings and populations. However, when an observed pattern, such as differential program effects, points to the existence of a previously unidentified but important ingredient, this might be a just-so story, a seemingly compelling but inaccurate account. Accordingly, the testing of previously unidentified elliptical assumptions is recommended and illustrated.

The present paper studies the role of environmental education based on transformative learning theory. It intends to present and test a model proposal using sequential mediation analysis of several constructs as the Environmental Education Support (EES) and Volunteer Attitude (VA). A quantitative study was carried out by using data obtained through online questionnaires from several Indian and Brazilian Higher Education Institutions. A multivariate statistical method was employed to analyse the data by using partial least squares structural equation modelling. The results demonstrated that environmental education positively influences students' environmental concern, willingness to be environmentally friendly, and volunteer attitude. As a novelty, it reports that environmental education beliefs, concern for the environment and willingness to be environmentally friendly sequentially mediate the relationship between environmental education support and volunteering attitude. Transformative learning; Environmental future: Are we trapped in our past? This paper is a reflection on how evaluators could approach theories of change through a foresight lens. It explores the role of assumptions and especially anticipatory assumptions in how we design our theories of change. It argues for a more open approach, a transdisciplinary approach to the multiple knowledges we bring to bear. It goes on to argue that if we do not build and use our imaginations to think differently about the future than the past, as evaluators we risk being trapped in findings and recommendations that assume continuity in a highly discontinuous world.

It is beneficial for the planet if we engage in more sustainable behaviors, such as using reusable items instead of single-use ones, thus reducing plastic pollution. We implemented an intervention to increase the use of reusable coffee cups, by employing behavior change techniques that targeted values towards environment, intention to use a reusable cup, and habit. The intervention was successful in increasing the participants' use of reusable cups. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the acceptability of the intervention and research methods, as well as opinions of participants about the process and intervention effectiveness, using a mixed methods approach. Participants (N = 156) answered open and closed survey questions about the acceptability of the intervention, and 11 participated in interviews regarding their experience of intervention. The intervention was deemed acceptable and useful by all participants, regardless of which intervention condition they were allocated to, according to both survey and interview data.

Yet, there is limited understanding of the processes and pathways to change through such programs, especially from the Global South. This paper presents key findings of a qualitative evaluation of the parenting 'Program P', which was implemented in El Alto, Bolivia. The study complements and aims to provide additional insights to an experimental evaluation of this program, which found limited impact on the intended objectives, including a reduction in violence against children and women and more gender equitable attitudes among parents. Thirty-six qualitative interviews and 6 focus groups were conducted with men and women that attended Program P, and facilitators of the program. Findings were analyzed thematically and organized around key successes and challenges of the program including motivations and ability to engage with the program, opportunities for supportive group-based processes, addressing hegemonic gender and social norms, and learning and applying skills as a platform to change behaviours. We use these findings to offer implications for more effective design and implementation of gender transformative, parenting programs in Bolivia and globally.

A formative evaluation of Project stRIde was conducted to gain insight from experts and identify revisions to the curriculum. Project stRIde is a science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) and nutrition-based curriculum developed for 4th and 5th grade students from low-income and diverse families. Nine experts spanning the fields of nutrition education, cultural competency, elementary education, summer programs, and STEAM outreach were recruited to participate in an expert content review (ECR) survey and virtual interviews. Seven core themes were identified: effectively promoting student engagement, increased guidance or support needed, activity too difficult for age, time, confidence in teaching lessons, cultural appropriateness, and strengths of curriculum in promoting STEAM education and innovation. Across the lessons, all reviewers agreed that the lessons were accurate, incorporated STEAM concepts, and were culturally appropriate for this population. Future major edits to the curriculum include creating supplemental videos, modifying some activities for age level, and incorporating more opportunities for participant engagement. Overall, an ECR is an effective way to examine a program's strengths and limitations and should be included in the beginning stages of program planning.

In this study, we introduced factors (i.e., evaluation design, attrition, outcome measures, analytic approach, and fidelity of implementation) that are often times required in the Federal Notice for application by the U.S. Department of Education, with an emphasis on What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) standards. We further presented a federally funded research protocol with a multi-year, clustered RCT design to determine the impact of an instructional intervention on students' academic performance in high-needs schools. In the protocol, we elaborated on how our research design, evaluation plan, power analysis, as well as confirmatory research questions and analytical approaches were aligned with the grant requirement and WWC standards. We intend to provide a road map to meeting WWC standards and to increase the likelihood of successful grant applications.

To shed light on the research done on this topic over the last 20 years and propose a roadmap for the policy evaluation of microenterprise business support services and the development of microenterprise indicators, this work conducts a systematic review, following the PRISMA guidelines, of peer-reviewed journal articles examining the impact of business support services on microenterprise performance in low- and middle-income Latin American countries. We identified 679 studies, and 17 studies met the inclusion criteria. We found that the literature is surprisingly scarce; most studies focus on credits and impacts on financial performance and concentrate on Mexico; and only three articles involve randomised controlled trials.

One criticism of the project-focused approach is its failure to focus on broader system-level changes. This paper explores how Mayne's COM-B Theory of Change model can enhance the evaluation of how projects and system-level investments can lead to system-level changes, especially in a development context. Using a real-world example, we offer several evaluation questions to initiate thinking about what might be needed to extend the ideas in the COM-B theory of change to facilitate better interrogation of systems-level change efforts.

Early and ongoing formative evaluation can make a major impact on program outcomes; however, there are few frameworks that provide actual guidance on how programmatic or research teams can systematically perform this kind of important work. In this article we describe the use of an iterative real-time interview feedback framework we developed for Check It, a community-wide chlamydia screening and treatment program for young African American men in New Orleans, Louisiana. The framework considers the diverse and needed perspectives of multiple stakeholders, including participants, interviewers, transcribers, program staff, and lead researchers and/or administrators. Interviews were conducted with N = 15 Check It participants utilizing this approach. Employing the framework led to critical insights that resulted in several vital programmatic and evaluation improvements. Lessons learned, including strengths and challenges of utilizing the framework, are also shared so that this model can be replicated or adapted by program planning and evaluation professionals for other kinds of programs.

Additionally, if there has been a change in organisational culture, to what extent does this change differ from the preferred type? Cameron and Quinn's OCAI questionnaire was used to determine the types of organisational culture. 453 valid responses were obtained from teachers of randomly selected public secondary schools in all regions of the Czech Republic. Pre-Covid-19, the present and preferred status were assessed. It was found that initially hierarchy culture was predominant, while currently preferences for adhocracy and market culture have increased significantly, although the hierarchy type still prevails. In the type of future, respondents will see the clan of organisational culture. The shift in each type, but also in each of its dimensions in the three periods studied, provides the researcher with a theme for deeper research into the context, and for school institutions and principals to develop strategies to support the creation of a healthy organisational culture. Organisational capacity to create community change (BC4): A model to support successful program planning and implementation Community-based interventions (CBIs) are increasingly used to address health problems and are usually implemented by organizations outside and/or inside the community. CBIs are complex and organizations need to have, or be able to build the capacity needed to implement CBIs effectively. The importance of organizational capacity building is well established in the literature, but less attention is focused on how to build capacity, particularly for prevention-focused and mental health CBIs. As part of the longitudinal process evaluation of a national initiative to promote the mental health and wellbeing of men and boys in the United States, this study developed a capacity-building model to identify areas and associated factors that were integral to grantee organizations' ability to build capacity to create change in their communities. The findings identified five domains used to comprise the Building Capacity to Create Community Change model, which contributed to organizational capacity building and as a result, implementation progress: Administrative Support, Leadership, Vision and Mission, Partnership Development, and Community Engagement. Strength in each domain increased grantees' capacity to impact the lives of participants and progress towards the goal of creating community change.

Identifying at-risk young people is a core service priority. This report describes a \"Youth Social Inclusion Program\" developed in Australia to assist young people identified as having social difficulties that prevent them linking into formal mental health services. This report describes the Australian service context and uses the \"program explication\" methodology to document: the program activities, therapeutic processes, and underpinning evidence for the benefits of this service. Program explication is a consulting method designed to assist services to identify and review implicit program logic assumptions against evaluation literature. We demonstrate the application of this method in exploring the assumptions and evidence for the Youth Social Inclusion Program, targeting outreach to socially anxious young people in Australia. The Youth Social Inclusion Program involved seven logically consistent activities. Our literature search revealed moderate evidence for the expected benefits of the activities. This practice-based design drew on several theoretical perspectives. Given that the program logic has been established, we outline a proposal for further evaluation.

This has added urgency in the context of rising rates of poverty-related unemployment in the UK in 2022. The current paper details the protocol used in the evaluation of the Back Onside Programme; a community-based programme delivered by the Bradford Bulls Foundation in the Bradford District. The Programme supports people from low socio-economic backgrounds who are unemployed or at risk of unemployment to maintain regular physical activity through a ten-week physical activity intervention. This pilot study evaluates how a physical activity intervention may impact the mental and physical health of people who are unemployed or at risk of unemployment in an uncontrolled pragmatic pilot study. Four cohorts run back-to-back between May 2021 and May 2022, with separate groups for men (N = 100) and women (N = 60). Physical and wellbeing assessment at baseline and post-intervention is conducted. If the intervention works in this context for these individuals, it will be a promising low-cost community-based intervention for people who are unemployed or at risk of unemployment.

Higher attendance is associated with greater benefit. Using data from two trials, conducted in Tanzania from 2014 to 2019 (MAISHA study), we retrospectively examined associations between individual and group-level factors and attendance at a gender training intervention, among women in established microfinance groups (CRT01, n = 528), and in newly-formed neighbourhood groups (CRT02, n = 629). High attendance was defined as participation in 7 or more of 10 sessions. More women were high attenders in CRT02 (81.74 %) than CRT01 (66.67 %). In both trials, older age was positively associated with attendance (CRT01: adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.43, In CRT01 only, past IPV victimization was positively associated with attendance (aOR: 1.71, 95 %CI: 1.07-2.73, p = 0.024), while secondary education and larger group size were negatively associated with attendance (aOR: 0.59, 95 %CI: 0.36-0.97, p = 95 %CI: 0.19-0.75, p = 0.006 respectively). There was limited evidence of associations between factors examined and attendance in CRT02. Programme implementers should consider potential barriers to women's engagement and implement strategies to support participation, particularly for younger women, given their increased risk of IPV.

To test the applicability of the quality of life concept (QoL) in evaluations of financial assistance programs to sovereigns, we apply the OECD well-being framework to the programs in a euro area country, and find that the multidimensional framework promises policy-relevant findings, capable of informing other approaches for evaluating program relevance and effectiveness. The framework's headline indicators nevertheless, needed to be complemented with additional indicators owing to data challenges. The well-being dimensions demonstrate that our primary country case and other assisted euro area countries struggled to protect some vulnerable groups before and during the crisis years, although many QoL indicators depict improvement once program completion approached. In many cases, gender, age and education level related differences were apparent, and should be better considered in future crisis programs. The framework also facilitates considering governance elements with our enhancements. It offers good grounds for deepening the understanding of stakeholders' perception of reform benefits or shortcomings, thus of program ownership. By using the OECD framework we explore some interpretative limits of QoL in evaluation, and underscore that a full program evaluation would require careful integration in primary case data. Further research and data set improvements would enhance this approach's utility.

Results showed that the retrospective approach yielded a greater magnitude of change in participants' perceptions of changes in their understanding and practices related to the LEI content. In addition, the retrospective approach identified changes in participant's beliefs that were unable to be detected using traditional pre-posttest surveys due to ceiling effects at the time of the pretest. Implications for evaluators are to consider retrospective designs to measure changes in beliefs when participants self-select into interventions and therefore presumably hold high beliefs about the content at the outset of the intervention.

In this paper, we examine the design and implementation of a WP in Kazakhstan. We do so by executing a cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) and performing a case study analysis which investigates how the implementation process unfolded and what factors shaped it most. We find that the high cost per unit of current benefit of Kazakhstan's WP is, in part, the result of benefit 'leakage' to the non-poor, high levels of informal labor, and means-testing applicants. Furthermore, overly bureaucrat requirements of official residency and household asset documents, poor staff training because of high staff turnover, staff not following standardized procedures because of low wages and corruption, and central government KPIs resulted in \"creaming\" of the best applicants and improper blending with other active labor market policies. Our findings provide important lessons, such as (1) formal restrictions on eligibility lead to expensive means-testing of applicants and (2) official residency and household asset documents lead to \"creaming\" of the best applicants.

In 2010, the Patient Protection Affordable Care Act (PPACA) standardized and expanded the eligibility criteria for the Medicaid program across the United States. In 2012, the constitutionality of this expansion was challenged and the Supreme Court rules that states were only required to expand their Medicaid program if they wanted to utilize the additional funds allotted by the federal government. This research paper examines the effects of the expansion by looking at health data in expansion and non-expansion states. Specifically, this study compares metrics designed to gauge healthcare access, health behaviors and health outcomes to determine if expansion has had positive overall effect on expansion states. We conclude that expansion states have demonstrated improved access to healthcare and improved health outcomes than the non-expansion states. Changes in health behaviors reflect mixed results - HIV screenings are higher in expansion states but participation in flu vaccinations show no statistical significance difference between the two groups. Given the results of this analysis, we conclude that Medicaid expansion is an effective policy for states to pursue in order to further the original objectives of Medicaid by improving the health of low-income recipients.

Student satisfaction is a major factor in the overall success of outdoor environmental education programs. While the impact of these programs on student knowledge, attitudes, and behavior has been assessed often, student satisfaction has been subject of much less research. This study analyzes student satisfaction with four outdoor environmental education programs in the Czech Republic. The authors collected qualitative (N = 68) and quantitative (N = 323) data from the program participants after they had completed their respective programs. According to the results, the students appreciate a clearly defined program with meaningful activities. Also important is the role of the program leader and the students' having the opportunity to influence the activities during their free time in the program. Student satisfaction can in some cases be decreased by challenging weather and by demanding social interactions with their peers.

These interventions are considered \"complex\" in that they have many mechanisms of change and related outcomes. Few HVIPs clearly identify the underlying mechanisms of intervention and explicitly link those with key outcomes however, limiting the field's ability to know what works best and for whom. To develop a program theory of change for these \"complex interventions, \" a non-linear, robust methodology that is grounded in the lived experience of those delivering and receiving services is needed. To aid researchers, evaluators, students, and program developers, we describe the use of Grounded Theory as a methodology to enhance the development of complex interventions, illuminating a non-linear approach that engages key stakeholders. To illustrate application, we describe a case example of The Antifragility Initiative, a HVIP in Cleveland, Ohio. The development of the program theory of change was conducted in four phases: (1) review of existing program documents, (2) semi-structured interviews with program developers (n = 6), (3) a focus group with program stakeholders (n = 8), and (4) interviews with caregivers and youth (n = 8). Each phase informed the next and culminated in a theoretical narrative and visual model of the Antifragility Initiative. Together, the theoretical narrative and visual model identify the underlying mechanisms that can promote change by the program.

Quality Assurance; Higher education institution; care access for planning purposes: The Basilicata Region experience The delivery of healthcare services at regional level should be modeled on population needs, stemming from patients' consumption pattern and trying to include unexpressed needs and exclude excesses of demand due to both moral hazard behaviors and inducements from the supply side. We propose a model able to estimate the frequency of access in outpatient care (OC) based on the characteristics of the population. According to empirical evidence, among the determinants of outpatient access we include variables addressing health, socioeconomic status and place of residence, plus variables related to the supply of services. We run generalized linear models for counting data of the Poisson family with the aim of both identifying the determinants of OC utilization and quantifying the related effects. We use the regional administrative database of Basilicata region, year 2019. Results are consistent with literature findings and provide new insights into the analysis of OC, suggesting that our model could easily be implemented by regional policymakers to plan the supply of ambulatory services on population needs.

In Utah, Salt Lake County's transition from a large, centralized emergency shelter sited in a free transit zone to a decentralized scattered-site model outside of a no-cost transit zone provided the context to evaluate how transportation access and mobility patterns of PEH were affected as they were displaced from a centralized service network in a downtown core. We conducted 19 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with PEH aged 18 + who were staying in one of three distributed resource centers who had also previously stayed at the former centralized shelter. Thematic analysis of the interviews resulted in three categories, each with distinct sub-categories: 1) Pre-decentralization transportation and mobility, 2) Post-decentralization transportation and mobility, and 3) Recommendations to improve transportation access for PEH, including lowering or eliminating financial barriers to transportation and expanding transit and shuttle van frequency and route radius. Study findings demonstrate that there is a significant need for community planners to collaborate on the siting of homeless shelters to provide more affordable, flexible, and equitable access to transportation networks.

The objectives indicated in the national strategic plans are monitored through the definition of a set of milestones and targets. This makes it necessary to define realistic and financially consistent target values. The aim of this paper is to outline a methodology to quantify robust target values for result indicators. As the main method, a machine learning model based on multilayer feedforward neural networks is put forward. This method is chosen for its ability to model possible non-linearities in the monitoring data and estimate multiple outputs. The proposed methodology is applied to the Italian case, more specifically to estimate target values for the result indicator related to enhancing performance through knowledge and innovation for 21 regional managing authorities. The related performance is then compared with that of traditional methods adopted to estimate target values. Results demonstrate the superiority of neural networks and suggest that this methodology might be used as a tool to help all Member States fulfill the key task of setting coherent and realistic targets for all result indicators. 2023-2027 Common Agricultural Policy; New Delivery Model; Result indicators; Carta, V.

However, in non-Anglophone countries, using EMI in undergraduate programs may contribute to human rights violations and inequalities. This qualitative study explores the lack of justice and fairness in EMI policy implementation in undergraduate programs, resulting in structural inequity based on students' experiences. Open-ended responses were collected from undergraduate students in four colleges, including healthcare, sciences, engineering, and computer science. A thematic analysis of students' responses revealed three major themes: the roots of inequities in EMI undergraduate programs, struggles faced by English as Foreign Language (EFL) undergraduates, and suggested tactics and solutions to address injustice in EMI classes. The study aims to provide international educators and policymakers with a better understanding of the challenges EFL students face in EMI classes and amplify the voices of students often neglected in internationally published studies. The findings suggest the need for policymakers to re-evaluate the effectiveness of EMI policies in non-Anglophone countries and promote equity, fairness, and social justice in universities to help students achieve equal opportunities to learn and succeed, irrespective of their English proficiency.

Fidelity monitoring of interventions is important for preserving program adherence, impact outcomes and to make evidence-based adaptations. The aim of this study was to develop a fidelity tool for the TOP program following an iterative and co-creative process and subsequently evaluate the reliability of the tool. Three consecutive phases were carried out. Phase I: Initial development and pilot testing two methods namely self-report and video based observation. Phase II: Adaptations and refinements. Phase III: Evaluation of the psychometric properties of the tool based on 20 intervention videos rated by three experts.The interrater reliability of the adherence and competence subscales was good (ICC.81 to .84) and varied from moderate to excellent for specific items (ICC between .51 and .98). The FITT displayed a high correlation (Spearman's rho.79 to.82) between the subscales and total impression item. The co-creative and iterative process resulted in a clinical useful and reliable tool for evaluating fidelity in the TOP program. This study offers insights in the practical steps in the development of a fidelity assessment tool which can be used by other intervention developers.

Similar factors have also affected recruitment in the outlying island of Penghu, Taiwan. Multiple-attribute decision-making (MADM) techniques for evaluation model development were incorporated in the present research to investigate the key determinants of talent recruitment by the coffee house operators in the outlying island of Penghu. The decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) approach was first implemented to (i) examine the extent of mutual impact between evaluation predictors and (ii) develop an influential network relation map (NRM) for indicator and sub-indicator assessments. Subsequently, the DEMATEL-based analytic network process (DANP) technique was utilised to compute the weights of every indicator and sub-indicator. Additionally, the modified VlseKriterijumska Optimizcija I Kaompromisno Resenje or VIKOR (in Serbian) approach evaluated every indicator and sub-indicator performance gap for empirical data analysis with suggested conclusions and recommendations. The results showed that the first dimension that should be improved is past experience, followed by personality traits and professional competence, according to the causal diagram of the NRM. The weights acquired through the DANP indicated that professional competence was the most influential dimension, followed by personality traits, whereas past experience was the least influential. Past experience revealed that the highest gap value is the most important for development if coffee house operators want to attain the appropriate levels. Finally, the theoretical, managerial, and practical implications were discussed. Notably, the research outcomes could optimise talent recruitment, establish appropriate talent recruitment methods for coffee house operators, and enhance the human resource quality in the outlying island of Penghu.

Existing well-being frameworks and tools provide a relevant starting point. Taking into account its multidimensional nature, well-being assessment is well suited to assess both the expected positive effects of the technology as well as unintended negative consequences. To-date the establishment of causal links mostly stems from intuitive causal models. Such approaches neglect the fact that to prove causal links between the operation of an AI system and observed effects is difficult due to the immense complexity of the socio-technical context. This article aims at providing a framework for ascertaining the attribution of effects of observed impact of AI on well-being. An elaborated approach to impact assessment potentially enabling causal inferences is demonstrated. Furthermore, a new Open Platform for Well-Being Impact Assessment of AI systems (OPIA) is introduced, which is based on a distributed community to build reproducible evidence through effective identification, refinement, iterative testing, and cross-validation of expected causal structures.

One potential way to provide systematic evaluations of programs and build evaluation capacity for practitioners is through a facilitated community of practice (CoP). We developed a CoP involving 37 organizations who were pivoting to online EE programs within the United States due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our goals were to build organizational capacity in evaluation and adaptive management to improve these organizations' online EE programs. We describe our CoP design, challenges associated with its implementation, and the benefits reported by participants in the CoP. Participants reported that they improved their evaluation skills and attitudes towards evaluation and developed social capital with a new network of colleagues. They also reported positive changes in practice, both individually and organizationally; considered new outcomes for their programs; and learned about using evaluation data to systematically improve programs. Educators shared their learning both within and outside of their organizations. Those who were more regularly involved in this community reported more positive benefits than others who were less involved. We share our reflections on the process and make suggestions for other evaluators to consider in similar CoP designs.

Although these evidence-based programs have demonstrated benefits for students, it is also well-established that programs must be implemented with quality and sustained to maximize positive outcomes. To support schools in implementing SEL that is integrated into all aspects of a school community, the CASEL School Guide implementation model was developed to guide school leadership teams in establishing a vision; selecting, implementing, and sustaining evidence-based programs; and integrating SEL schoolwide. The School Guide model is based on CASEL's School Theory of Action which includes planning, implementing, and monitoring schoolwide SEL. This paper describes findings about the feasibility and degree of implementation of this model as carried out by 14 school leadership teams who were supported by SEL coaches. The participating schools implemented an evidence-based SEL program as the foundation of their efforts to promote schoolwide SEL. Findings demonstrate the feasibility of implementing this model in urban schools that primarily serve students of color, as all teams successfully carried out the implementation model and demonstrated increased levels of capacity related to supporting schoolwide SEL.

A preceptor-training programme was developed that build on this model and implemented through an intervention. The initial programme theory hypothesised that trained preceptors would promote support and develop competence in students in comparison to untrained preceptors. Results showed a poor outcome because few preceptors participated and a high student attrition rates. The authors then posed the question \"Why did the preceptorship training programme not work?\" This article offers insight into the context, mechanism, and outcome of the preceptor-training programme through a realist evaluation. Reflective field notes, gathered during the intervention, were used and gave insight regarding how, for whom, and under which circumstances the programme could work and offered a refined programme theory for preceptorship. The main conclusion drawn showed that a preceptor-training programme alone is not the sole determining factor to ensure preceptors' motivation to transfer their learning; a systems approach, ensuring the effectiveness of the programme, should be followed. Reflection on findings indicated the implementation context as a major determining factor of the training programme.

The underlying programme theory In healthcare, moving and handling people (MHP) often cause musculoskeletal disorders. To prevent musculoskeletal disorders due to MHP, many national evidence-based guidelines have been developed. However, little is known about how these guidelines were intended to work, i.e. their 'programme theory', how implementation by intended users is influenced by contextual factors and mechanisms to produce outcomes. This paper identifies the programme theory of a national MHP guideline (MHPG) using thematic analysis of the MHPG document, three organisational planning documents, and interviews with MHPG developers. The analysis identified the intended users of the MHPG as health and safety managers and MHP coordinators. The programme theory comprised contextual factors, potentially hindering (e.g. budget constraints) or facilitating (e.g. changing demographics) implementation, being influenced by mechanisms mainly based on ethical (quality of care, evidence-based practices), and economic reasoning (reducing cost of MHP, return on investment) to reduce injuries caused by MHP - the intended outcome.

E Exploring challenges and lessons learned in cross-cultural environmental education research The field of environmental education (EE) has been criticized for scarcity of research findings that can be used to compare the approaches and outcomes of various interventions and contexts. This is particularly problematic for EE programs that are implemented across multi-cultural settings because very little academic attention has been devoted to cross-cultural EE research methods. Intending to address this gap, we set out to develop and pilot a pre/post survey in Costa Rica that could help us investigate the impacts of a bird-focused curriculum on Latin American children's knowledge, attitudes, behavioral intentions, and behaviors toward birds and the natural world. This article describes the challenges encountered and subsequent adaptations made throughout our ongoing, iterative survey development process, in order to appropriately address language, sociocultural context, audience, and research-to-practice tensions. We present key lessons learned, including the importance of having strong local partners, the need to create a realistic research timetable that accounts for unique challenges involved in undertaking cross-cultural EE research, and the limitations of quantitative methods in this sort of research.

However, the challenges they encounter in developing their impact case studies against specified government assessment criteria and how pitfalls can be mitigated are not reported. This paper examines the key steps taken to develop an Aboriginal Family Wellbeing (FWB) empowerment research impact case study in the context of an Australian Research Council (ARC) pilot research impact assessment exercise and the challenges involved in applying the ARC criteria. The requirement that researchers demonstrate how their institutions support them to conduct impactful research has the potential to create supportive environments for researchers to be more responsive to the needs of users outside academia. However, the 15-year reference period for the associated research underpinning the reported impact and the focus on researcher's current institutional affiliation constitute potential constraints to demonstrating the true impact of research. For researchers working with Indigenous people, relationships that build over long periods of time, irrespective of university affiliation, are critical to conducting impactful research. A more open-ended time-frame, with no institutional restrictions for the 'associated research' provides the best opportunity to demonstrate the true benefits of research not only for Indigenous people but for Australian society more broadly.

The general theme behind this trend is that greater community involvement provides researchers and practitioners with culturally relevant information to make interventions successful. This involvement is usually solicited through the formation of community coalitions and advisory boards. Although the positive influence of community partnerships is well established, strategies for successfully developing and sustaining these partnerships are less clear. To address this gap, this paper presents evaluation findings from The Making Connections Initiative, a national effort emphasizing community-level prevention strategies for improving the mental health of men/boys. Sixteen grantees were tasked with developing a coalition of community organizations to provide input into the development and implementation of a local prevention initiative. An evaluation of the 16 grantees' planning activities identified four themes related to developing and sustaining successful community partnerships. This article reports on the strategies that were found most successful across grantees. With the increasing popularity of community-based programs, strategies for successfully partnering with local organizations are particularly important.

Data from invoices, inventories, rapid market assessments, and customers surveys were analyzed for evidence of impact on the service delivery and personal domains of food access. For some indicators, initial gains were concentrated between pre- and interim evaluation periods, followed by either a leveling off or decline between interim and post. However, overall results were promising, with increases noted in the number of healthy items ordered by store owners, in daily foot traffic and transactions, and in consumer confidence for certain healthy behaviors.

OPR is based on a sound partnership between all stakeholders to improve organizational practices. However, little research on the evaluation of OPR health partnership exists. This systematic mixed studies review sought to produce a new theoretical model that structures the evaluation of the OPR processes and related outcomes of OPR health partnerships. Six bibliographic databases were searched together with grey literature sources for OPR health partnership evaluation questionnaires. Six questionnaires were included, from which a pool of 95 OPR health partnership evaluation items were derived. The included questionnaires were appraised for the quality of their origin, development and measurement properties. A framework synthesis was performed using an existing OPR framework by organizing questionnaire items in a matrix using a hybrid thematic analysis. This led to our proposed Organizational Participatory Research Evaluation Model (OPREM) that includes three axes, Trust, Collective Learning and Sustainability (with specific dimensions) and 95 items. This model provides information to help stakeholders comprehensively structure the evaluation of their partnerships and subsequent improvement; thus, potentially helping to improve health organization practices.

Program evaluation was conducted using Interrupted Time Series (ITS) modeling. Results showed significant (p < .05) decreases in nonconformities across all five models with small to moderate effect sizes. Based on the relative effects, values for reductions in civil penalty costs between 16% and 47%, were predicted.

Current debate questions the ability of logic modelling techniques to incorporate contextual factors into logic models. We share experience of developing a logic model within an ongoing realist evaluation which assesses the extent to which, and under what circumstances a community health workers (CHW) programme promotes access to maternity services in Nigeria. The article contributes to logic modelling debate by: i) reflecting on how other scholars captured context during LM development in theory-driven evaluations; and ii) explaining how we explored context during logic model development for realist evaluation of the CHW programme in Nigeria. Data collection methods that informed our logic model development included documents review, email discussions and teleconferences with programme stakeholders and a technical workshop with researchers to clarify programme goals and untangle relationships among programme elements. One of the most important findings is that, rather than being an end in itself, logic model development is an essential step for identifying initial hypotheses for tentative relevant contexts, mechanisms and outcomes (CMOs) and CMO configurations of how programmes produce change. The logic model also informed development of a methodology handbook that is guiding verification and consolidation of underlying programme theories.

Thus, the EU supports such training via the European Social Fund (ESF). The evaluation community evaluates the support by using either qualitative or quantitative methods. The simultaneous application of these two approaches is rare. The purpose of this paper is to combine quantitative (counterfactual impact evaluation) and qualitative (qualitative comparative analysis) methods in order to fill the methodological gap. Based on the combination of both approaches, it explores their strengths, complementarity and disadvantages to evaluate public support for employee training in the Czech Republic.

This intervention is designed to keep youth with a mental health problem out of the criminal/legal system by equipping police officers with developmentally appropriate information and techniques. Whereas much is known about the adult-focused CIT training, little is known about the youth-focused training. This preliminary investigation uses multiple methods (training observations, officer interviews, and pre/post-tests) to assesses the implementation of CIT-Y in two Midwest counties. Multiple 8-hour training sessions were offered in both counties with 127 officers participating and completing the pre/post measure. The findings of this study confirmed that CIT-Y training was feasible in these counties and acceptable to the officers who participated. Outcomes from the pre/post-tests show that 86% of officers positively changed their knowledge and attitudes regarding youth with mental health problems.

This study evaluated an MI training delivered in a low socioeconomic elementary school that had recently invested in three movement facilitative classrooms (a kinesthetic classroom and two activity labs). We investigated (a) the training's fidelity in meeting recommended best practices for professional development and (b) school professionals' perspectives of the training. Eight school professionals participated in the study, including five classroom teachers, two activity lab supervisors, and the principal. The researchers used a video of the training to rate the fidelity of the training to best practice recommendations. Interviews, field notes, and informal conversations with participants were qualitatively analyzed for themes. The training received a total fidelity score of 42%. Qualitative findings highlighted participants' varied perspectives of the training's purpose, challenges associated with the training and future recommendations for MI trainings. For MI trainings to be a valuable asset in increasing teachers' value and effective implementation of MI, trainings need to be designed to be in line with best practice recommendations and teachers' perceived needs.

Studies abound, but do not examine roles and practices to reveal the processes through which networks create transformative capacity. This participatory single case study provides a framework to examine structures, roles and practices. The framework details common network substructures, across which critical practices occur, and provides a typology of specific network practices of curators and sojourners. The primary claim is that a variety of structures and interdependent roles and practices work in concert to support transformation across sites and scales. Results have implications for network design, leadership, practice, and evaluation.

In 2014, the Government of Malawi launched the Right Foods at the Right Time (RFRT) program in Ntchisi district delivering nutrition social and behavior change communication, a small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement to children 6-23 months, and nutrition sensitive activities. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems are key aspects of successful program implementation. We describe these and the methodology for an impact evaluation that was conducted for this program. Two monitoring systems using traditional and electronic platforms were established to register and track program delivery and processes including number of eligible beneficiaries, worker performance, program participation, and to monitor input, output, and outcome indicators. The impact evaluation used comparative cross-sectional and longitudinal designs to assess impact on anthropometric and infant and young child feeding outcomes. Three cross-sectional surveys (base-, mid-, and end-line) and two longitudinal cohorts of children followed in 6-month intervals from 6 to 24 months of age, were conducted in sampled households in the program and a neighboring comparison district. Additional M&E included qualitative studies, a process evaluation, and a cost-effectiveness study. The current paper describes lessons from this program's M&E, and demonstrates how multiple implementation research activities can course-correction and program scale-up.

Our aim is to provide an overview of the characteristics of published research impact case studies, including translation activities, and their reporting quality. We searched for peer-reviewed impact studies published between 2000 and 2018 using a case study approach and selected 25 suitable papers. We applied descriptive statistics to study characteristics, conducted thematic analysis of research translation activities and assessed reporting quality using the 10-point ISRIA statement. 24 papers reported intermediate impacts, such as advocacy, or the development of statements, tools, or technology. 4 reported on longer-term societal impacts, such as health outcomes and economic return on investment. 7 reported on translation activities. Papers scored well against the ISRIA statement on 5 domains of reporting quality. Weakest scores centred around identification of stakeholder needs and stakeholder involvement, and ethics and conflict of interest. We identified the need for more consistency in reporting through a case study approach, more systematic reporting of translation pathways and greater transparency concerning estimated costs and benefits of the research and its translation and impact assessment.

The contemporary post-truth phenomenon is characterised by denial of facts and tolerance of politicians' lies. It has enhanced the appeal of authoritarian and nationalist leaders as a populist reaction to policy failures. While emerging market countries hugely benefited from globalization, the hourly wages of working people in high-income countries have stagnated while inequality has surged, and environmental stresses have escalated. Post-truth dispositions are distorting decision making in the public sphere and they have increased public distrust of knowledge professionals. This is likely to aggravate the very problems that gave rise to the post-truth phenomenon. Evaluation can help reverse the trends that underlie voters' anxieties, amplification of tribal prejudices and appeals to national pride through sound advice, transparency and public education. This will require new evaluation policy directions.

Effective after-school programs could positively impact both physical activity and overweight/obesity, however previous reviews and meta-analyses have indicated minimal effects. Both 4- and 3-day/week versions of a social cognitive theory-driven physical activity/nutrition after-school program were evaluated against unstructured care to assess effects in children (overall Mage = 10.00 years, SD = .80). For changes over 9 months in body mass index (BMI), effects sizes (Cohen's d) were .68, .40, and .07 in the 4-day (n = 70), 3-day (n = 70), and unstructured (n = 50) groups, respectively. Similar patterns of effects were found for changes in free-time physical activity and cardiovascular endurance. Incorporating a theory-based prediction model previously supported in teens through older adults, with and without medical disorders and health-risk factors, improvements in exercise-related self-regulation and self-efficacy, and mood, significantly predicted increased free-time physical activity (R2 = .48). Effects significantly strengthened to R2 = .62 when completion/non-completion of the recommended 300 min/week of physical activity was also accounted for. Change in BMI was inversely related to physical activity change, =-.14, p < .05. The present evaluation process indicated promising effects, and indicated theory-based targets to foster future program improvements.

With resilience theory now emphasising the complex and dynamic nature of resilience capacities, processes and outcomes, resilience programming stands to benefit from approaches such as design-based research and realist research/evaluation. The aim of this collaborative (researcher/practitioner) study was to explore how such benefits can be achieved when programme theory spans individual, community and institutional outcomes, with a focus on the reciprocal processes involved in effecting change across the social system. The context of the research was a regional (Middle East and North Africa) project operating in contexts with an escalated risk of marginalised young people being drawn into illegal/harmful activity. The project's youth engagement and development approach combined participatory learning, skills training, and collective social action, adapted for diverse localities and during the COVID-19 crisis. Quantitative measures of individual and collective resilience were at the centre of a set of realist analyses evidencing systemic connections in changes to individual, collective and community resilience. Findings demonstrated the value, challenges and limitations of the applied research approach for adaptive, contextualised programming.

Analysing the effects of financial education on student knowledge gain This paper describes the results of an experiment conducted in a technical university in Italy in 2019, involving the implementation and evaluation of an innovative short course on financial education. The programme applied a novel approach based on online learning and its effectiveness is compared against the effects of a traditional on-campus lecture, within an experimental setting. The findings indicate that the programme is effective: one week after taking the course, the students improved their pre-course test scores by about 4 points out of 10. No statistically significant difference in gains is found between students assigned to the online vs the on-campus mode of learning, suggesting a potential positive role of digital learning in this specific setting. An exploratory analysis of factors associated with the outcome reveal that the course has been particularly beneficial for those students initially less interested in finance.

Surveys measuring various outcomes that are used in program evaluation are frequently modified from their original versions in response to the unique context of programs. Modifying existing published surveys by removing or adding items can affect the psychometric properties of the original scale and may produce differing results. The results of the comparisons found that unmodified and modified surveys had similar reliabilities; however, one of the scales produced contradictory evaluation findings. Lessons learned from this study suggest that scales can be modified in evaluation, but great care is needed to address the potential strengths and limitations of the modified scale and balance the technical needs with responsiveness to program context.

Previous research has demonstrated PA-based charity fundraising events may act as a catalyst for increased motivation for PA by fulfilling basic psychological needs while providing an emotional connection to a greater good. Therefore, the current study used a behavior-change based theoretical paradigm to develop and assess the feasibility of a 12-week charity-based virtual PA program intended to increase motivation and PA adherence. Forty-three participants were enrolled in a virtual 5 K run/walk charity event that included a structured training protocol, web-based motivation resources, and charity education. Eleven participants completed the program and results indicated no differences pre- and post-participation in motivation (t(10) = 1.16, p = .14) and self-efficacy (t(10) = 0.66, p = .26), but increased scores on charity knowledge (t(9) = 2.50, p = .02). Attrition was attributed to timing, weather, and isolated nature of a solo virtual program. Participants enjoyed the structure of the program and felt the training and educational information was beneficial, but could have been more robust. Thus, in its current format, the program design lacks efficacy. Integral changes to increase program feasibility should include group programming, participant-chosen charity, and more accountability.

Through an example of a drop-in located in the inner-city of Toronto, we describe how, first, theories of change based on funder and even staff perspectives may have program goals that do not connect with the lives and values of clients. Second, engagement with clients should surface heterogeneities in their expectations; many theories of change, even when they are developed with clients, assume there is a 'homogenous' clientele. Third, programs that address the needs of marginalized individuals need to pay attention to the dynamics of marginalization. These points have consequences for the development of the initial theories of change.

To address this Ethiopian government ratified Rural WASH sanitation and hygiene promotion through a community-centered approach, and to improve WASH service evidence on the effectiveness of an intervention at the household level is needed in developing countries. However, in our country one WASH in rural areas called community centered approach intervention was planned and delivered for 3 years (2018-2020) Nevertheless, as to our review and researchers knowledge, the outcome of this intervention is not evaluated yet in our country as well as in this evaluation study area. WASH; Program; Project; perspectives on a national model public health and public safety partnership to reduce overdose deaths NYC RxStat, the United States' first public health and public safety partnership aiming to reduce overdose deaths, began in 2012 and established a national model for cross-sector partnerships. The partnership aimed to integrate data-driven policing with actionable public health interventions and surveillance to develop and implement cross-sector overdose responses. With federal support, jurisdictions nationally have implemented public health and public safety partnerships modeled on RxStat. To inform partnership replication efforts, we conducted a stakeholder evaluation of RxStat. We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 25 current and former RxStat stakeholders. Interviews probed stakeholder perceptions of RxStat's successes, challenges, and opportunities for growth. Interview data were iteratively coded and thematically analyzed. Stakeholders reported certainty about the need for cross-sector collaboration and described cross-disciplinary tensions, challenges to collaboration and implementation, and opportunities for partnership optimization and growth. Findings informed 12 strategies to improve RxStat and partnerships in its model, organized into three opportunity areas: (1) ensure stakeholder and agency accountability; (2) build secure and mutually beneficial data systems; and (3) structure partnerships to facilitate equitable collaboration. Cross-sector partnerships offer a promising strategy to integrate the public health and safety sectors, but disciplinary tensions in approach may hamper implementation. Findings can inform efforts to implement and scale cross-sector partnerships.

The present evaluation investigated mental health and social connection within the context of COVID-19 by remotely evaluating a virtual animal-assisted activity at the University of Saskatchewan - PAWS Your Stress. The purpose of this article is to outline our evaluation methods and findings, while calling specific attention to the collaborative strategies that were implemented within a remote, time-sensitive context. The evaluation findings revealed that remote animal-assisted programming can facilitate connections with humans and animals, and promote multiple mental health benefits, despite the lack of physical interaction with the animals. Our lessons learned indicate that remote program logic modelling workshops are feasible when suited to audience demographics. Further, our experience suggests that the Most Significant Change technique (a qualitative, participatory, storytelling method that elicits outcome data) can be useful in time-restricted evaluations, and the necessity of central steps in the process may vary depending on evaluation goals. This project has implications for future evaluation work, by demonstrating the effective use of remote methods that allowed for successful stakeholder collaboration.

One significant change was the new public management-inspired commissioner's document, first issued in 2013 by the Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care Services, to establish medical and surgical departments' identification of patients with underlying substance abuse problems (Ministry of Health and Care Services, 2013). Herein, we investigate how multiple stakeholders and actors, who bear responsibility in regional and local health trusts, have responded to the commissioned services to establish routines for identifying alcohol and substance abuse problems among patients admitted to medical and surgical wards. First, an extensive literature search was conducted. Second, we conducted qualitative interviews with informants who have responsibility for applying the commissioner's document in regional health authorities and local hospitals. The study results demonstrate that responsible actors at all levels take establishing alcohol routines seriously, and that hospitals' self-assessment of their achievements on internal goals indicate that they have made satisfactory progress. Nevertheless, improvement is needed to meet the goal of discussing alcohol use with all patients admitted to medical and surgical wards within local health trusts. Recommendations for the next steps, based on these findings, include further research and training priorities.

The intervention was integrated with women's self-help groups (SHGs) in Uttar Pradesh, India. The key assumption tested in this paper was the linkage between SHG membership, program exposure, and maternal, newborn, and child health practices. Learnings were substantiated through empirical investigations, including structural equation modeling and mediation analysis, as well as 'co-learning' workshops within the community. The workshops aimed to capture and interpret the heterogeneity of local contexts through deep dialogs with the community and program implementers at various levels. Statistical analyses indicated a significant association between the amount of women's program exposure and their health practices. SHG membership was shown to affect maternal health practices; however, it did not have a direct effect on neonatal or child health practices. The 'co-learning' workshops revealed crucial aspects, such as prevailing socio-cultural norms, which prevented pregnant or recently delivered women from participating in SHG meetings. This paper encourages evaluators to work with the community to interpret and co-construct meaning in unpacking the contextual forces that seldom appear in the program ToC.

Within this two-phase study, women with obesity participating in community-based treatments with educational (Phase 1 n = 57, Phase 2 n = 44) and behavioral (Phase 1 n = 80, Phase 2 n = 53) formats were contrasted on psychosocial variables over 3 and 6 months and their interrelations based on the mood-behavior-model and coaction theory. Phase 1 findings informed curricular extensions in Phase 2. In Phase 1, there were significant overall improvements in total mood disturbance, self-regulation of exercise, self-regulation of eating, and weight, which were more pronounced in the behavioral vs. educational format group (3.5 % vs. 1.4 % weight loss, respectively). Mediation analyses indicated that change in self-regulation of exercise mediated the prediction of change in self-regulation of eating by mood change. Phase 2 findings were similar; however, effect sizes were greater (6.2 % vs. 2.9 % weight loss, respectively). Within both phases, increased self-regulation of eating significantly predicted weight reduction. Paths from changes in moodself-regulation of exerciseself-regulation of eating suggested future program attention focus on treatment-associated mood change reinforcing self-regulation, and self-regulation generalizing from an exercise to eating context.

The purpose of this organizational evaluation project's evaluation activities was to engage with Quality of Life (QOL) Grant recipients, namely leaders at disability-related organizations across the United States, to better understand their definitions and operationalization of the term, \"quality of life\". To do so systematically, researchers compiled a list of all QOL grant recipients from two 2016 grant cycles and divided them into three categories based on the award amount. From these categories, we randomly selected organizations to invite to provide input. Phone interviews were completed with 19 grant recipients. A thematic content analysis was completed across the resulting transcripts using MAXQDA software. The sub-themes identified by researchers included: community connection, independence, self-determination, caregiver communication, and including caregivers in programs. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of both community and caregiver relationships to organizations that focus on QOL for people with SCI. Novel findings suggest the importance of community and connection as well as a reframing of both the constructs of independence and control within QOL. Lessons for evaluators are also provided.

Theoretically, autonomy is important because the evaluation professional ought to be free to make recommendations in several key areas: framing the evaluation questions, including questions of unintended consequences; developing evaluation plans; choosing methods; analyzing data; making conclusions, including negative findings in reports; and, increasingly, ensuring that historically underrepresented stakeholders without voice are represented and involved in the evaluation process. This study found that evaluators in Canada and the USA reportedly did not perceive autonomy as related to the larger role of the field of evaluation, but rather as a contextual personal concern, that is, related to matters of personal circumstance, such as their workplace, years of experience, financial security, and the backing or lack thereof from professional associations.

A WPL places a charge off-street parking provided by employers. The scheme acts as a transport demand management measure with the revenue hypothecated for funding transport improvements. The WPL and the measures that it funds thus form an integrated package aimed at achieving social, economic and environmental benefits. The approach afforded a robust evaluation of the outcomes and impacts of a WPL package of measures.

Research has grown about the EMI versus non-EMI lecturers and students' performance measured through perception, motivation, discursive analysis or satisfaction measures. However, results have not been conclusive in the scarce number of papers comparing quantitative course grades of EMI versus non-EMI students. The aim of this research paper is to prove that there is no difference in attaining learning objectives among students within a Business Administration Degree in Spain regardless the language of instruction. The present observational study considers all enrolled freshman throughout a horizon of six consecutive years allowing more reliable results not affected by the specificities of courses or years. All 212 students in the EMI track were matched to non-EMI track counterparts taking into account all available covariates. Results not only show that there is no difference in the attained learning objectives between the two tracks, but also that EMI students' grades are in fact better than their non-EMI counterparts, which might help to remove the believe many still have on the lower academic attainment of those following an EMI track.

Over the years, NIH has implemented several programs to attract early-stage investigators and other applicants without prior NIH support. The latest of these is the Next Generation Researchers Initiative. These programs have been shown to be successful in meeting NIH-wide goals but their success for any particular NIH institute or center (IC), and in any particular year, is determined by a variety of factors, some extrinsic to an IC's funding decision process. Each IC must balance support for new investigators with funding for productive ongoing programs of research. We examine historical trends in support of new investigators at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) over a 22-year period, as well as trends in some major extrinsic influences on that support. The results indicate that NIH's new investigator programs have succeeded in maintaining a balance between the support for new NIAID investigators while also continuing to support an expanded pool of established investigators. The programs have been particularly effective in providing support to early-stage investigators.

In this era, we need leaders with strong emotional and social skills to create a positive and ethical impact in society. In this study, due to the requirements of the Post-Truth Era which necessitates a new approach to leadership development, an arts-based learning intervention entitled Arts-Based Creative Leadership Communication Program is designed for leaders with three main objectives to increase, firstly, their creative communication skills; secondly, healing effect of arts for their resilience; and, thirdly, their social sensitivity through arts. After the design and implementation of this program, its targeted effects on the participants were analyzed. Results indicated that all of the expected outcomes were achieved successfully. The highest development was seen in the healing effect, while change in social sensitivity appeared as the lowest. Emotional skills as non-verbal communication element was developed more than social skills. Meanwhile, the emergence of the pandemic with its digital transformation process increased the effects of the program. To sum up, the program was found successful for the leaders in the Post-Truth Era.

While large-scale rigorous research on welfare-to-work programs has demonstrated effectiveness towards employment in other countries, no such micro-level evaluation of a policy has ever been conducted in Singapore. This article describes the process of developing a large experimental evaluation of the Work Support Program, which the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports started in 2006. The lessons learned from planning and implementing the research can be helpful to future researchers in negotiating long-term rigorous evaluations in an environment where collaborators lack sufficient research knowledge.

Federal programs stress performance-based outcomes, valid and reliable data, addressing important problems, ensuring efficiency and fiscal responsibility, reducing burden on federal staff and grantees, and developing and disseminating useful solutions and recommendations. MANILA Consulting Group, Inc., (MANILA), in partnership with Battelle Centers for Public Health Research and Evaluation (Battelle) and RMC Research Corporation (RMC), has been conducting the SS/HS national cross-site evaluation, which involves the coordinated efforts of federal Project Officers, local education agencies, technical assistance providers, communication specialists, and national and local evaluators across a diverse set of socioeconomic and cultural contexts. To date, the national cross-site evaluation has provided data indicating that the SS/HS Initiative is, in fact, meeting these goals. Findings revealed that fewer students reported they had experienced violence and fewer students reported they had witnessed violence. Fully 96 percent of school staff said SS/HS had improved school safety. There was a 263 percent increase in the number of students who received school-based mental health services and a 519 percent increase in those receiving community-based mental health services. In addition, more than 80 percent of school staff reported that they saw reductions in alcohol and other drug use among their students. These encouraging results stress the need for ongoing coordination at all levels of the Initiative to continue to ensure safer schools and healthier students. This article provides an overview of the initiative and introduces four articles in this special issue.

Researchers in academic, organizational, and community-based settings have applied concept mapping successfully without the benefit of systematic analyses across studies to identify the features of a methodologically sound study. Quantitative characteristics and estimates of quality and rigor that may guide for future studies are lacking. To address this gap, we conducted a pooled analysis of 69 concept mapping studies to describe characteristics across study phases, generate specific indicators of validity and reliability, and examine the relationship between select study characteristics and quality indicators. Individual study characteristics and estimates were pooled and quantitatively summarized, describing the distribution, variation and parameters for each. In addition, variation in the concept mapping data collection in relation to characteristics and estimates was examined. Overall, results suggest concept mapping yields strong internal representational validity and very strong sorting and rating reliability estimates. Validity and reliability were consistently high despite variation in participation and task completion percentages across data collection modes. The implications of these findings as a practical reference to assess the quality and rigor for future concept mapping studies are discussed.

The article argues that organizations should embrace qualitative approaches more widely and introduces ethnographic vignettes as one example to explain the complexity of post-conflict situations. By understanding the personal dimension, the life- and work-styles of international peacebuilders, the current evaluation discourse can become more meaningful-both for organizational learning and sustainable peace efforts on the ground.

As one component of the national cross-site evaluation of the SPF State Incentive Grant Program (SPF SIG), an instrument was developed to assess state substance abuse prevention system infrastructure in order to measure infrastructure change and examine the role of state infrastructure in achieving prevention-related outcomes. In this paper we describe the development of this instrument and summarize findings from its baseline administration. As expected, states and territories were found to vary substantially with respect seven key characteristics, or domains, of state prevention infrastructure. Across the six domains that were assessed using numeric ratings, states scored highest on data systems and lowest on strategic planning. Positive intercorrelations were observed among these domains, indicating that states with high capacity on one domain generally have relatively high capacity on other domains as well. The findings also suggest that state prevention infrastructure development is linked to both funding from state government and the presence of a state interagency coordinating body with decision-making authority. The methodology and baseline findings presented will be used to inform the ongoing national cross-site evaluation of the SPF SIG and may provide useful information to guide further research on state substance abuse prevention infrastructure.

To estimate the impact of grantee characteristics, grant operations, and near-term outcomes in reducing violence and substance use, promoting mental health, and enhancing school safety, logged odds ratios (LORs) were calculated contrasting Year 3 with Baseline performance from grantee-provided data on seven outcome measures. After comparing grantee performance across outcomes and outcomes across grantees, the LORs were entered as dependent variables in a series of meta-regressions in which grantee characteristics, grant operations, and near-term outcomes were tested after controlling for pre-grant characteristics. Findings indicate that the SS/HS Initiative significantly improved most outcomes, that within-grantee performance varied greatly by outcome, and that random-effects meta-regression appreciably decreased the variance available for modeling. The approach demonstrates that the SS/HS Initiative is effective and that locally collected performance data can be used to estimate grantee success in improving youth outcomes.

Of the 281 clients who scheduled an appointment for an evaluation to initiate mental health services, 64% completed the evaluation. In the multivariate analysis, Latinos were significantly less likely than whites to complete the mental health evaluation. Further, there was a significant decrease in the likelihood of completing the mental health evaluation as the number of days between the Rapid Response System contact and the date of the evaluation appointment increased.

Worksite leaders teamed with co-workers to select and implement environmental changes to increase walking steps over individual baseline and to choose healthy eating options over 10 weeks. Participants were 226 primarily white, women employees in 5 sites. A mixed methods process evaluation, conducted to identify determinants of intervention effectiveness and to explain differences in outcomes across worksites, included surveys, self-reports of walking and eating, interviews, focus groups, and an intervention log. The evaluation assessed reach, characteristics of recruited participants, dose delivered, dose received, and context and compared sites on walking and eating outcomes. Emergent elements of participant-reported dose received included: active leadership, visible environmental changes, critical mass of participants, public display of accomplishments, accountability to co-workers, and group decision making. Participants at sites with high reach and dose were significantly more likely than sites with low reach and dose to achieve intervention goals. Although this small pilot needs replication, these findings describe how these evaluation methods can be applied and analyzed in an environmental intervention and provide information on trends in the data.

Spatial analysis was used to identify rental properties based on three inclusion criteria (affordability, proximity to public transportation, and proximity to grocery stores), three exclusion criteria (areas of high crime, prostitution, and sexual predator residence), and three suitability criteria (proximity to health care, mental health care, and youth serving organizations). The results were applied to four different scenarios to test the utility of the model. Of the 145 affordable rental properties, 27 met the criteria for safe and effective housing. Of these, 19 were located near bus routes with direct service to post-secondary education or vocational training programs. Only 6 were considered appropriate to meet the needs of youth who had children of their own. These outcomes highlight the complexities faced by youth when they attempt to find affordable and suitable housing following emancipation. The LEASE prototype demonstrates that spatial analysis can be a useful tool to assist with planning services for youth making the transition to independent living.

This article presents a community prevention model (CPM) focusing on this problem among pre and early adolescents. The model, consisting of a community mobilization strategy and environmental strategies targeting homes, schools, and retail outlets, is designed to increase community readiness and reduce the availability of HLPs, which is hypothesized to reduce HLPs use among children. The CPM is being tested in Alaskan rural communities as part of an inprogress eight-year National Institute on Drug Abuse randomized-controlled trial. This paper presents the CPM conceptual framework, describes the model, and highlights community participation, challenges, and lessons learned from implementation of the model over a 21-month period.

With the rapid development of economy, China's higher education has entered a new stage and made a series of extraordinary achievements. However, the uneven development of higher education has become a critical factor restricting China's overall progress. In this paper, we propose Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach to evaluate the performance of higher education resource utilization from the perspective of provincial level. In addition, we assess productivity changes of each province with the help of Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI). Further, by considering the enrollment quota as a special kind of resource, we construct a more reasonable allocation scheme, while keeping the total number of newly added enrollment quota unchanged in the next year. Finally, according to the results, some suggestions are put forward to help the Chinese government better solve the unbalanced development of higher education among provinces.

Formative participatory research was undertaken to design a program for young Aboriginal people in a remote town in North West Australia with a high level of health needs and relatively few prevention initiatives. Focus groups and advisory discussions with Aboriginal community members were used to determine the nature of the program. The need for a comprehensive program was consistently expressed and limited healthy lifestyle knowledge and difficulties with healthy eating influenced by food environments were noted to be important. With guidance from the Derby Aboriginal Health Service, findings were integrated with previous international research evidence to develop a program tailored to local Aboriginal people aged 15-25 years and refine it after piloting. This 8-session program, 'Maboo wirriya, be healthy' involved an education component consistent with the US Diabetes Prevention Program and practical activities including group exercise. Changes to program structure and documentation were made after piloting for future use. The community-directed approach used in this study is vital to ensure relevance of localised chronic disease prevention programs in a range of settings.

Critics advocate that traditional cultural competence training focusing on individual, professional skills-building should be replaced by cultural humility approaches that focus on humble engagement of participants. Little is known about how home visiting programs serving broadly diverse populations experience cultural competence and/or cultural humility efforts and initiatives on the ground. Interviews approximately 90120 min in length were conducted with 34 home visiting program administrators in a large Midwestern state. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded thematically, and subjected to content analysis. Two themes were identified from interviews. Respondents emphasized that: 1) cultural competency training was required by home visiting program models, so cultural competency questions were always addressed in home visitation, especially in training for new home visitors; and 2) cultural competence also included many aspects of cultural humility, commitment to continuous self-evaluation and self-reflection on cultural encounters that identified cultural knowledge gaps and sought more information. Respondents did not see cultural competency and cultural humility as oppositional and saw both concepts as important for engaging participants in home visitation.

This area of research has integrated and modified the existing CCA approach to provide a means of evaluating components of programs without a solid evidence-base, across a variety of target outcomes. This adapted CCA approach (a) captures a variety of similar program characteristics to increase the quality of the comparison within components; (b) identifies components from four primary areas (i.e., content, process, barrier reduction, and sustainability) within specific programming domains (e.g., vocation, social); and (c) proposes future directions to test the extent to which the common components are associated with changes in intended program outcomes (e.g., employment, job retention). The purpose of this paper is to discuss the feasibility of this adapted CCA approach. To illustrate the utility of this technique, researchers used CCA with two popular employment programs that target successful Veteran reintegration but have limited program evaluation - Hire Heroes USA and Hire Our Heroes. This adapted CCA could be applied to longitudinal research designs to identify all utilized programs and the most promising components of these programs as they relate to changes in outcomes.

These challenges are well documented, but there is a relative absence of papers devoted to addressing them based on examples and evidence. In this paper, we report our review of 51 empirical studies of participatory evaluations conducted in the international domain, focusing on the methods of inclusion used in the evaluations. Our findings address \"the who\" (which stakeholders are included and which excluded), \"the why\" (rationales for participation) and \"the how\" (by what means and in what manner) of inclusion. We were struck by the scale of some development programs, geographically and in terms of the number of diverse program sponsors and stakeholders, and how this necessitated highly creative, innovative participatory techniques to ensure that anyone (and in some cases everyone) could have a voice in the process, regardless of location, language ability, privilege, power, gender, age or culture.

Since the available official statistical microdata were insufficient to conduct reliable impact evaluations, the main findings were obtained through a counterfactual impact evaluation using newly produced micro survey data. Moreover, the research provides a heterogeneity analysis of groups of trainees, in order to identify the categories for which the programme performs best. The main results reveal that the training measure has a positive, but modest impact upon employability in Romania: participation increases employment chances properly controlled by 15%. It is most successful for women and for people living in urban areas. Measures for increasing the impacts of the vocational training programme in Romania are identified in terms of better targeting and profiling the trainees and closer adjustment of the programme to the specific needs of the labour market.

A trial found exposure to SHARE was associated with reductions in IPV and HIV incidence. This mixed methods process evaluation was conducted between August 2007 and December 2009, with people living in SHARE intervention clusters, to assess awareness about/participation in SHARE, motivators and barriers to involvement, and perceptions of how SHARE contributed to behavior change. Surveys were conducted with 1407 Rakai Community Cohort Study participants. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 20 key informants. Most (77%) were aware of SHARE, among whom 73% participated in intervention activities. Two-thirds of those who participated in SHARE felt it influenced behavior change related to IPV. While some felt confident to take part in new IPV-focused activities of a well-established program, others were suspicious of SHARE's motivations, implying awareness raising is critical. Many activities appealed to the majority (e.g., community drama) while interest in some activities was limited to men (e.g., film shows), suggesting multiple intervention components is ideal for wide-reaching programming. The SHARE model offers a promising, acceptable approach for integrating IPV prevention into HIV and other established health programs in sub-Saharan Africa.

Data were collected using a group-administered survey among 39 agricultural development professionals participating in a national workshop in December 2015. The survey consisted of 48 competencies representing eight core competencies, and each competency had level of importance and level of competency parts. The findings show that extension workers in Cambodia deemed all competencies highly or very highly important to their extension work; however, their perceived level of competency in those competencies appeared not to meet the expectations. The level of competency in all but communication skills and diversity significantly differed by gender but not by age and experience. Respondents indicated all four methods\u2014preservice, in-service, basic induction training, and participation in seminars, workshops, and webinars\u2014equally appropriate to acquire core competencies. The findings imply that the agricultural development authority in Cambodia should review, update, or design extension education curricula incorporating the competencies highlighted in this study and train its extension cadres on those competencies.

As such, it is important to understand what contributes to the success of such partnerships. This paper describes the Alaska Fourth R collaborative, a multisectoral group of agencies (including education, health and human services, the violence against women sector, the governor's council on domestic violence, and an external evaluator) that successfully planned, implemented and evaluated a multi-focus health education program statewide. The purpose of this paper was to explore the ways in which seven pre-identified factors contributed to the successful achievement of the collaborative's goals. This project was grounded in community-based research principles, and collectively, the group chose to use Roussos and Fawcett's (2000) seven-factor model as the basis for the project. Using this model as a guide, semi-structured interviews were conducted with five leaders from the key organizations in the collaborative. In interviews, stakeholders described how each of the seven factors functioned in the Alaska collaborative to contribute to project success, with a particular focus on the critical role of relationships. Three specific relationship facets emerged as cross-cutting themes: flexibility, transparency, and prioritization. In sum, taking the time to build deep and authentic relationships, and then developing a shared vision and mission within the context of relationships that are flexible, transparent and prioritized, provided a strong foundation for future success in this collaborative.

Data were collected through a self-reported survey in 2007, semi-structured interviews in 2009, and EWPH-CP program documentation throughout the 2006-2010 funding cycle. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were used along with an integrative framework for assessing local capacity building to characterize the capacity built by the study coalitions. Four coalitions rated membership characteristics as a challenge at the beginning of the funding cycle. Towards the end of the funding cycle, all seven coalitions reported activities that were initially focused on building their membership (i.e., member capacity) or positive working relationships (i.e. relational capacity), before eventually pursuing support and resources (i.e., organizational capacity) for implementing their chosen community-oriented programmatic goals (i.e., programmatic capacity). Five coalitions reported environmental changes aimed at increasing physical activity or fruit and vegetable intake. Technical assistance provided to coalitions was credited with contributing to the achievement of programmatic goals. These results suggest that the coalitions succeeded in building local capacity for increasing age-appropriate physical activity or fruit and vegetables intake in the target communities.

This article presents the findings from an evaluability study of 40 interventions of Belgian development cooperation. A study framework was developed focusing on three key dimensions (i.e. theoretical evaluability, practical evaluability and the evaluation context) and subdivided over the different OECD/DAC criteria. Drawing upon a combination of desk and field research, the study framework was subsequently applied on a set of 40 interventions in Benin, DRC, Rwanda and Belgium. Findings highlight that the context dimension scores remarkably better than the theoretical and practical evaluability in particular. The large majority of the interventions have the conditions in place to satisfactorily evaluate effectiveness and efficiency while the opposite holds for sustainability and impact in particular. These findings caution against commissioning of evaluations that ritually focus on all OECD/DAC criteria regardless of their readiness. It underscores the usefulness of a flexible 'portfolio' approach towards evaluations, in which a more systematic use of evaluability assessment from the start of interventions could play a role.

School-university partnerships are recommended to leverage teachers' capacity to use MI. A mixed method process evaluation was conducted of the first year of implementing Partnerships for Active Children in Elementary Schools (PACES). Classroom teachers (N=12) from four schools participated. Data were collected in Fall 2014 (baseline) and Spring 2015 ( four months of intervention) using the System for Observing Student Movement in Academic Routines and Transitions and semi-structured interviews. There were no significant differences between intervention classrooms and control classrooms MI promotion. Differences approaching significance (U=5, p=0.04, d=1.2) were observed when comparing classrooms that received two (community of practice, community-based participatory research) or three components (two components plus service learning) of the intervention and classrooms that received one (community of practice) or no components. Qualitative findings revealed that teachers in classrooms that were more successful responded more favorably to the intervention components than teachers in classrooms that were less successful. Quantitative and qualitative results supported the effectiveness of community-based participatory research as a component of PACES.

More recently, the Essential Competencies for Program Evaluators (Ghere et al., 2006; Stevahn, King, Ghere & Minnema, 2005a) have proven to be a useful taxonomy for learning and improving evaluation practice. Evaluation is critical to diversity training activities, and diversity training providers face the challenge of conducting evaluations of their training programs. We explored what competencies are viewed as instrumental to conducting useful evaluations in this specific field of evaluation practice. In an online survey, N = 172 diversity training providers were interviewed via an open answer format about their perceptions of evaluator competencies, with n = 95 diversity training providers contributing statements. The Essential Competencies for Program Evaluators were used to conduct a deductive qualitative content analysis of the statements. While systematic inquiry, reflective practice, and interpersonal competence were well represented, situational analysis and project management were not. Implications are discussed for evaluation capacity building among diversity training providers and for negotiating evaluation projects with evaluation professionals.

Identifying critical performance variables provides a mechanism by which funders can understand what they are purchasing without getting caught up in restrictive service specifications that restrict the ability of service providers to meet the needs of the clients. An implementation pathway and benchmarking programme called IN TOUCH provided contracted providers of home support and funders with a consistent methodology to follow when developing and implementing new restorative approaches for service delivery. Data from performance measurement was used to triangulate the personal and social worlds of the stakeholders enabling them to develop a shared understanding of what is working and what is not. The initial implementation of IN TOUCH involved five District Health Boards. The recursive dialogue encouraged by the IN TOUCH programme supports better and more sustainable service development because performance management is anchored to agreed data that has meaning to all stakeholders.

This paper, based on an evaluation conducted by the Independent Evaluation Group of the World Bank Group, examines how, and how well, the Bank uses feedback loops to enhance the poverty focus of its operations. Feedback loops are important for every element of the results chain running from data, to diagnostics, to strategy formulation and finally to strategy implementation. The evaluation uses a range of instruments, including surveys of stakeholders and World Bank staff, focus group meetings, country case studies and systematic reviews of Bank lending and non-lending operations. We find that while the Bank generates useful information on poverty reduction from its projects and programs, the feedback loops - from outcomes to data analysis to diagnostics to strategy formulation and implementation - have generally been weak, with sizable variation across countries.

We examined (a) the effect of PACES on the extent of movement integration (MI) and (b) changes in teachers' perceptions regarding MI. Purposively selected classrooms (grades 1-3) across four schools (3 intervention, 1 control) participated in the study. The sample included classroom teachers (N = 12) in Fall 2014 and Spring 2015, but the number of participants dropped to eight in Fall 2015 and Spring 2016. PACES consisted of three partnership approaches (a virtual community of practice, community-based participatory research, and university service learning) intended to increase the extent of MI in the intervention classrooms. We collected process data using the System for Observing Student Movement in Academic Routines and Transitions (SOSMART) and teacher interviews. PACES did not significantly impact the extent of observed MI. Interviews indicated that the intervention had both strengths and limitations. Building interpersonal support for teachers is important to their use of MI. A different measurement schedule (e.g., collecting MI data each day of the school week) may be required to more thoroughly capture MI instances.

Looking in the future of Information and Communication Technology in education in Vietnam Over the last two decades, crucial factors for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in education have improved significantly in Vietnam. Nevertheless, it is clear that, as in other countries, no educational revolution is taking place. We argue that there is a need for a broad dialogue on the future of ICT in education in Vietnam as discussion of ideas about future possibilities can be instrumental in rationalizing and generating educational change. We explore how a group of key players representing the public and private sector as well as development partners in the field look at the future of ICT in education in the country. Following the Delphi method, these key players assessed in different survey rounds the current situation of ICT in education, identified a series of targets and were asked to assess these targets in respect of their importance. The key players reached a consensus that the purpose of technology integration is to achieve learning goals and enhance learning. However, there is more controversy on targets that could potentially transform education practice in Vietnam. We discuss the value of the Delphi technique and argue for increased participation of all involved stakeholders in policy development on ICT in education.

Most unemployment insurance studies focus on whether increases in unemployment insurance generosity are predictive of poverty and health outcomes. Less work has used theory-driven approaches to understand and explain how and why unemployment insurance works, for whom, and under what circumstances. Given this, we present a realist synthesis protocol that seeks to unpack how contextual influences trigger relevant mechanisms to generate poverty and health outcomes. In this protocol, we conceptualize unemployment insurance as a key social protection policy; provide a supporting rationale on the need for a realist synthesis; and describe our process on identifying context-mechanism-outcome pattern configurations. Six methodological steps are described: initial theory development, search strategy; selection and appraisal of documents; data extraction; analysis and synthesis process; and presentation and dissemination of revised theory. Our forthcoming realist synthesis will be the first to build and test theory on the intended and unintended outcomes of unemployment insurance policies. Anticipated findings will allow policymakers to move beyond 'black box' approaches to consider 'mechanism-based' explanations that explicate the logic on how and why unemployment insurance matters.

Education evaluation has become increasingly important in the English-speaking Caribbean. This has been in response to assessing the progress of four regional initiatives aimed at improving the equity, efficiency, and quality of education. Both special interest groups and local evaluators have been responsible for assessing the progress of education and providing an overall synthesis and summary of what is taking place in the English-speaking Caribbean. This study employed content analysis to examine the indicators used in these education evaluation studies since the declaration of the Caribbean Plan of Action 2000-2015 to determine these indicators' appropriateness to the Caribbean context in measuring education progress. Findings demonstrate that the English-speaking Caribbean has made strides in operationalizing quality input, process, and output indicators; however quality outcome indicators beyond test scores are yet to be realized in a systematic manner. This study also compared the types of collaborative partnerships in conducting evaluation studies used by special interest groups and local evaluators and pinpointed the one that appears most suitable for special interest groups in this region.

Principals from 135 such interventions were invited to participate in a second review, and an exploratory study of the Principals' responses to this invitation was conducted. The study used a mixed-method approach, quantitatively describing characteristics of Principals and their interventions and qualitatively summarizing feedback from phone interviews with a convenience sample of Principals participating in a second review. Of the Principals invited, 21% accepted a second review, 24% were interested but unable or not ready to submit materials, and 56% did not accept or did not respond. Mental health treatment interventions were more likely to undergo a second review, and substance abuse treatment interventions were less likely. Similar percentages of interventions undergoing a second review had received funding from the National Institutes of Health (86%) and had been evaluated in a comparative effectiveness research study (79%). Overall ratings for interventions improved in each second review completed. The interviewed Principals perceived potentially lower ratings as the only risk in participating in a second review.

These prevention and disease management programs communicate critical information to the public, those affected by the disease, and health care providers. The National Diabetes Education Program (NDEP), the leading federal program on diabetes sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), uses primary and secondary quantitative data and qualitative audience research to guide program planning and evaluation. Since 2006, the NDEP has filled the gaps in existing quantitative data sources by conducting its own population-based survey, the NDEP National Diabetes Survey (NNDS). The NNDS is conducted every 2-3 years and tracks changes in knowledge, attitudes and practice indicators in key target audiences. This article describes how the NDEP has used the NNDS as a key component of its evaluation framework and how it applies the survey results for strategic planning and program improvement. The NDEP's use of the NNDS illustrates how a program evaluation framework that includes periodic population-based surveys can serve as an evaluation model for similar national health education programs.

Using canonical correlation analysis and a collection of 20 interviews, this study describes and tests the relationship between these two critical conceptual powerhouses in evaluation. Using data that were collected as a part of the NSF-funded research Beyond Evaluation Use (Lawrenz & King, 2009), this study found that some theories and beliefs about participatory evaluation contribute to use and influence in similar ways as in single-site evaluations. The differences identified in this research highlight potential planning and implementation considerations that might allow multi-site evaluators and funders of multi-site evaluation to enhance use of multi-site evaluations.

However, clinicians and other decision makers typically lack the time and ability to effectively search and synthesize the relevant research literature. In response to this opportunity, and to increasing policy and funding pressures for the use of evidence-based practices, a number of \"what works\" websites have emerged to assist decision makers in selecting interventions with the highest probability of benefit. However, these registers as a whole are not well understood. This article, which represents phase one of a concurrent mixed methods study, presents a review of the scopes, structures, dissemination strategies, uses, and challenges faced by evidence-based registers in the behavioral health disciplines. The major findings of this study show that in general, registers of evidence-based practices are able, to a degree, to identify the most effective practices meet this need to a degree. However, much needs to be done to improve the ability of the registers to fully realize their purpose.

Through educational offerings, these sites can generate excitement and curiosity about nature and motivate stewardship behavior, but only if their programs are high quality and meet the needs of their audiences. Evaluation is, therefore, critical: knowing what works, for whom, and under what conditions must be central to these organizations. Yet, many zoo and aquarium educators find evaluation to be daunting, and they are challenged to implement evaluations and/or use the findings iteratively in program development and improvement. This article examines how zoo education professionals engage with one another in a learning community related to evaluation. We use a communities of practice lens and social network analysis to understand the structure of this networked learning community, considering changes over time. Our findings suggest that individuals' roles in a networked learning community are influenced by factors such as communicative convenience and one's perceptions of others' evaluation expertise, which also contribute to forming and sustaining professional relationships. This study illuminates how project-based professional networks can become communities of practice.

Nonetheless, street youth are one of our most vulnerable yet underserved populations. Consequently, a medical and dental clinic was created in downtown Ottawa, Ontario to respond to their needs. The purpose of this study is to describe a process evaluation of the clinic during its first year of operation with a focus on program fidelity, dose, reach, and satisfaction. A mixed methods approach was used involving interviews with providers, focus groups with street youth, analysis of Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data, and supplemental information such as document reviews. The evaluation identified areas that were working well along with challenges to program implementation. Areas of concerns and possible solutions were presented to the management team that then helped to plan and make improvements to the clinic. Our evaluation design and working relationship with clinic management promoted the integration of real-time evidence into program improvements.

It was developed and evaluated using Drum and colleagues (2009) guidelines for implementing health promotion programs for individuals with disabilities. The purpose of this feasibility study is to describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of the HEMS program. Thirteen individuals with MS completed the 8-week health education program. A mixed method approach for evaluation was implemented (i.e., survey and focus groups). Process and resource feasibility demonstrated that over half of the participants attended at least 80% of the weekly sessions. Focus group data provided valuable feedback for future iterations of the program including critiques on the delivery, content, and group support provided. Outcome evaluation showed increases in self-efficacy (survey), improvements in theoretical constructs (focus groups), and increased physical activity (focus groups). Results show that health promotion programs for persons with MS can improve physical activity and related constructs. Next steps will be to revise, implement, and reevaluate the HEMS program in a larger randomized control trial.

This study examines the extent to which organizational factors, such as structure, leadership and readiness for change contribute to the implementation of community, policy and staffing domains representing organizational cultural competence. Analysis of a randomly selected sample of 122 organizations located in primarily Latino and African American communities showed that programs with public funding and Medicaid reimbursement were positively associated with implementing policies and procedures, while leadership was associated with staff having greater knowledge of minority communities and developing a diverse workforce. Moreover, program climate was positively associated with staff knowledge of communities and having supportive policies and procedures, while programs with graduate staff and parent organizations were negatively associated with knowledge of and involvement in these communities. By investing in funding, leadership skills and a strategic climate, addiction health services programs may develop greater understanding and responsiveness of the service needs of minority communities. Implications for future research and program planning in an era of health care reform in the United States are discussed.

This paper presents a formative process and outcome evaluation of the recovery PWP in Blantyre City, Malawi. The evaluation used longitudinal household survey data of PWP beneficiaries, programme records and interview responses from programme staff and community leaders. Largely, the process evaluation findings showed an agreement between actual and planned activities. The outcome evaluation found indications that the PWP community assets offered some potential benefits to the communities, and that PWP wages allowed the beneficiaries to purchase some food. This however, did not translate into more meals per day, nor did the earnings prevent the decline in household assets as expected. Given a plausible PWP theory and high implementation fidelity, the PWP wage rate or number of days was either just enough to smooth participant income, or insufficient altogether, to enable achievement of more distal outcomes.

We used concept mapping to elicit and integrate perspectives on kind discipline from teachers, administrators, and other school staff. Three core themes describing kind discipline emerged from 11 identified clusters: (1) proactively developing a positive school climate, (2) responding to conflict with empathy, accountability, and skill, and (3) supporting staff skills in understanding and sharing expectations. We mapped the identified components of kind discipline onto a social ecological model and found that kind discipline encompasses all levels of that model including the individual, relational, environmental/structural, and even community levels. This contrasts with the dominant individual-behavioral discipline approaches that focus on fewer levels and may not lead to sustained student and staff motivation. The findings illustrate the importance of setting and communicating clear expectations and the need for them to be collaboratively developed.

This course is designed to provide Federal Transit Administration (FTA) grantees an overview of regulations and best practices related to the procurement process. Our objective in conducting the evaluation was to understand how transit agency staff made changes in procurement practices in response to the course training. The evaluation was mixed mode: an Internet survey followed by in-depth interviews with a small group of respondents. Survey respondents were also provided with an open-ended question providing us with additional context for our evaluation. Results show that the training is substantially successful at meeting the goal of improving procurement practices at transit agencies; indeed, most respondents report making changes at their agencies as the proximate result of the training. This was at odds with our exploration of knowledge of procurement topics, as most respondents gave inaccurate answers on multiple-choice \"knowledge questions\". This may have been due to question structure or, more likely, the nature of online surveys. Suitable training on the procurement of information technology was also a main concern. The lack of training in this area is indicative of the broader challenge facing public transit agencies in how to incorporate new forms of technology into their existing practices and bureaucratic structures.

Likewise, its poor productivity in comparison with other sectors, such as manufacturing, has historically been criticized. Similar features are found in the Spanish traditional construction sector, which it has been described as not very innovative. However, certain characteristics of the sector may explain this behavior; the companies invest in R+D less than in other sectors and release fewer patents, so traditional innovation evaluation indicators do not reflect the true extent of its innovative activity. While previous research has focused on general innovation evaluation models, limited research has been done regarding innovation evaluation in the macro-construction sector, which includes, apart from the traditional construction companies or contractors, all companies related to the infrastructure life-cycle. Therefore, in this research an innovation evaluation model has been developed for macro-construction sector companies and is applied in the Spanish case. The model may be applied to the macro-construction sector companies in other countries, requiring the adaption of the model to the specific characteristics of the sector in that country, in consultation with a panel of experts at a national level. Macro-construction sector; Model; different stakeholders in participatory evaluation of health promotion: A literature review Participatory evaluation has been increasingly used in health promotion (HP) and various forms of participatory evaluation have been put into practice. Simultaneously, the concept of participation has become more important for evaluation research in general, which is equally diverse and the subject of various discourses. This study addresses the issue of how the concept of participation has been established in HP evaluation practice. An analytical framework was developed, which served as a basis for a literature review, but can also be used as a general framework for analyzing and planning the scope of participation by various stakeholders within different phases of participatory evaluation. Three dimensions of participation, which refer to decision making (decision power, deliberation) and action processes are distinguished. The results show that only a few articles discussed participatory evaluation processes and participatory (evaluation) research was largely put forth by participatory (action) research in communities. The articles analyzed referred mostly to three stakeholder groups - evaluators, program staff and beneficiaries - and to participation processes in the initial evaluation phases. The application of the framework revealed that decision power seems to be held predominantly by program staff, evaluators seem to be more involved in action processes and beneficiaries in deliberation processes. Participatory evaluation; Participatory research; Participation; mapping internal validity: A case of misconceived mapping? Since the early 1990s, the concept mapping technique developed by William M. K. Trochim has been widely used by evaluators for program development and evaluation and proven to be an invaluable tool for evaluators and program planners. The technique combines qualitative and statistical analysis and is designed to help identify and prioritize the components, dimensions, and particularities of a given reality. The aim of this paper is to propose an alternative way of conducting the statistical analysis to make the technique even more useful and the results easier to interpret. We posit that some methodological choices made at the inception stage of the technique were ill informed, producing maps of participants' points-of-view that were not optimal representations of their reality. Such a depiction resulted from the statistical analysis process by which multidimensional scaling (MDS) is being applied on the similarity matrix, followed by a hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) on the Euclidian distances between statements as plotted on the resulting two-dimensional MDS map. As an alternative, we suggest that HCA should be performed first and MDS second, rather than the reverse. To support this proposal, we present three levels of argument: 1) a logical argument backed up by expert opinions on this issue; 2) statistical evidence of the superiority of our proposed approach and 3) the results of a social validation experiment.

However, there is lack of comprehensive information on the time and costs borne by low-income patients and the persons accompanying the patient (caregiver) for colonoscopies in the United States. We surveyed patients in three health clinics in Philadelphia retrospectively who had undergone free colonoscopies in the previous 18-month period. Participants were asked questions about time and out-of-pockets expenses for themselves and their caregivers. Even when colonoscopies were free to the patient through Colorectal Cancer Control Program funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the patient and caregivers still incurred costs in relation to preparing for, undergoing, and recovering from a colonoscopy. These costs can be substantial and may account for some of the low colorectal cancer screening rates especially among the low-income populations. Patients' and caregivers' costs need to be considered when designing and implementing colorectal cancer control programs.

We describe the screening promotion costs of CRCCP grantees to evaluate the extent to which the program model resulted in the use of funding to support interventions recommended by the Guide to Community Preventive Services (Community Guide). We analyzed expenditures for screening promotion for the first three years of the CRCCP to assess cost per promotion strategy, and estimated the cost per person screened at the state level based on various projected increases in screening rates. All grantees engaged in small media activities and more than 90% used either client reminders, provider assessment and feedback, or patient navigation. Based on all expenditures, projected cost per eligible person screened for a 1%, 5%, and 10% increase in state-level $34, and $17, respectively. CRCCP grantees expended the majority of their funding on Community Guide recommended screening promotion strategies but about a third was spent on other interventions. Based on this finding, future CRC programs should be provided with targeted education and information on evidence-based strategies, rather than broad based recommendations, to ensure that program funds are expended mainly on evidence-based interventions.

In this context, logic analysis can be a particularly useful option, since it can be used to test the plausibility of a program's intervention theory using scientific knowledge. Professional development in public health is one field among several that would truly benefit from logic analysis, as it appears to be generally lacking in theorization and evaluation. This article presents the application of this analysis method to an innovative public health professional development program, the Health Promotion Laboratory. More specifically, this paper aims to (1) define the logic analysis approach and differentiate it from similar evaluative methods; (2) illustrate the application of this method by a concrete example (logic analysis of a professional development program); and (3) reflect on the requirements of each phase of logic analysis, as well as on the advantages and disadvantages of such an evaluation method. Using logic analysis to evaluate the Health Promotion Laboratory showed that, generally speaking, the program's intervention theory appeared to have been well designed. By testing and critically discussing logic analysis, this article also contributes to further improving and clarifying the method. Logic analysis; Intervention theory; Theory-based evaluation; Program evaluation; cancer screening provision in CDC's Colorectal Cancer Control Program: Comparisons of colonoscopy and FOBT/FIT based screening We assess annual costs of screening provision activities implemented by 23 of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Colorectal Cancer Control Program (CRCCP) grantees and report differences in costs between colonoscopy and FOBT/FIT-based screening programs. We analysed annual cost data for the first three years of the CRCCP (July 2009-June 2011) for each screening provision activity and categorized them into clinical and non-clinical screening provision activities. The largest cost components for both colonoscopy and FOBT/FIT-based programs were screening and diagnostic services, program management, and data collection and tracking. During the first 3 years of the CRCCP, the average annual clinical cost for screening and diagnostic services per person served was $1150 for colonoscopy programs, compared to $304 for FIT/FOBT-based programs. Overall, FOBT/FIT-based programs appear to have slightly higher non-clinical costs per person served (average $1018; median $838) than colonoscopy programs (average $980; median $686). Colonoscopy-based CRCCP programs have higher clinical costs than FOBT/FIT-based programs during the 3-year study timeframe (translating into fewer people screened). Non-clinical costs for both approaches are similar and substantial. Future studies of the cost-effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening initiatives should consider both clinical and non-clinical costs.

The evaluation was guided by the theories of cultural competence (American Psychological Association, 2003; Bamberger, 1999; Wadsworth, 2001) and established frameworks for the evaluation of professional development/training and instructional design (Bennett, 1975; Guskey, 2002; King, 2014; Kirkpatrick, 1967). The explicit and implicit stakeholder assumptions about the connections between program resources, activities, outputs, and outcomes are described. Participant knowledge and skills were measured via scores on a pre/posttest of professional knowledge, and a standards-based performance assessment rubric. In addition to measuring short-term program outcomes, we also sought to incorporate theory-driven thinking into the evaluation design. Hence, we examined participant self-efficacy and access to social capital, two evidenced-based determinants or \"levers\" that theoretically explain the transformative space between an intervention and its outcomes (Chen, 2012). Data about program determinants were collected and analyzed through a pre/posttest of self-efficacy and social network analysis. Key evaluation findings include participant acquisition of new instructional skills, increased self-efficacy, and the formation of a nascent professional support network. Lessons learned and implications for the design and evaluation of cross-cultural teacher professional development programs are discussed.

Meanwhile, policy-makers look for research reports written in plain language with clear application, which are attuned to current policy settings and produced quickly. In a context where there are calls in western nations for evidence based policy with stronger links to academic research, such a mismatch can present significant challenges to policy program evaluation. The purpose of this paper is to present one attempt to overcome these challenges. Specifically, the paper describes the development of a conceptual framework for a large-scale, multifaceted evaluation of an Australian Government health initiative to expand Nurse Practitioner models of practice in aged care service delivery. In doing so, the paper provides a brief review of key points for the facilitation of a strong research-policy nexus in public health evaluations, as well as describes how this particular evaluation embodies these key points. As such, the paper presents an evaluation approach which may be adopted and adapted by others undertaking public health policy program evaluations.

The Borich's Needs Assessment Model was used to achieve the objectives of the study. A sample of 298 respondents was randomly selected and interviewed using a pre-tested structured questionnaire. Thirty-three core competency items were assessed. Instrument validity and reliability were ensured. The cross-sectional data obtained was analysed using SPSS for descriptive statistics including mean weighted discrepancy score (MWDS). Results of the study showed that on a scale of 5, the most important core extension competency items according to respondents' perception were: \"Making good use of information and (M=4.81, SD=0.76). In terms of proficiency, the highest competency identified by the respondents was \"Conducting farm and home visits (M=3.62, SD=0.82) followed (M=3.13, SD=0.64). The discrepancies implying competency deficits were widest in \"Acquiring and allocating resources\" (MWDS=12.67); use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and web-based resources in agricultural extension (MWDS=12.59); and report writing and sharing the results and impacts (MWDS=11.92). It is recommended that any intervention aimed at developing the capacity of extension workers in Peninsular Malaysia should prioritize these core competency items in accordance with the deficits established in this study.

The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore strategies involved in fostering youth needs support within six leadership programs. Two leaders and 30 youth participated in semi-structured interviews to better understand the strategies used to foster needs support. Findings revealed that leaders were able to foster a sense of relatedness among youth through building trusting adult-youth relationships and nurturing an inclusive environment. Maximizing choice and negotiating youth voice helped to foster youth's autonomy. Finally, creating a task-oriented climate and providing intentional opportunities for skill-building helped to foster youth's competence. Findings suggest that training for leaders is critical in understanding what, and how strategies should be employed to help foster youth needs support in leadership programming.

The article notes several advantages of mainstreaming the SMART method including program capacity building and being able to independently monitor progress toward process and outcome objectives. It is argued the one size fits all approach for writing SMART objectives is misleading. The context in which the evaluation is conducted is a key deciding factor in how and when the SMART criteria should be applied. Without an appreciation of the evaluation context, mainstream users may be developing objectives that are far from smart. A case example is presented demonstrating a situation where a stepwise, rather than simultaneous application of the SMART criteria was necessary. Learning from this case, recommendations are forwarded for adjusting how SMART criteria should be presented in mainstream evaluation manuals/guides.

Concept mapping and focus groups were implemented as complementary methods to investigate the conditions of use of a health equity tool by public health organizations in Quebec. Using a hybrid integrated research design is a richer way to address the complexity of questions emerging from intervention and planning settings. This approach provides a deeper, operational, and contextualized understanding of research results involving different professional and organizational cultures, and thereby supports the decision-making process. Concept mapping served to identify and prioritize in a limited timeframe the conditions to be considered for incorporation into a health equity tool into public health practices. Focus groups then provided a more refined understanding of the barriers, issues, and facilitating factors surrounding the tools adoption, helped distinguish among participants' perspectives based on functional roles and organizational contexts, and clarified some apparently contradictory results from the concept map. The combined use of these two techniques brought the strengths of each approach to bear, thereby overcoming some of the respective limitations of concept mapping and focus groups. This design is appropriate for investigating targets with multiple levels of complexity. Methodology; Mixed methods; Concept mapping; Focus groups; Health equity; into the affective domain The experimental study was undertaken to examine the effect of emotionalized learning experiences on the academic achievement of students at Preston University. The major objectives of the study were to identify the effect of teaching methods on students' academic achievement and to evaluate the relationship between affective learning conditions and students' academic achievement. Based on four intact semesters, the population of the study comprised 140 students from the Bachelors of Business Administration Program. The whole population was considered as the sample. The control group (28 students) was taught through the interactive lecture method, whereas, the experimental group 1 (35 students), experimental group 2 (46 students) and experimental group 3 (31 students) were taught through the activity method, reflective learning method and cooperative learning method respectively. Results indicated a significant difference between the pretest and posttest scores obtained in the achievement test as a result of the effect of teaching methods used for offering the emotionalized learning experiences. There was also a significant relationship between affective leaning conditions and students' academic achievement. Furthermore, it was found that students' academic achievement in the affective domain was highest with regard to workshops 1, 2 and 3. It was concluded that the emotionalized learning experiences offered to the students via the four teaching methods helped students in enhancing their knowledge, changing their attitudes and developing their skills with regard to living a happy, healthy and meaningful life. However, the reflective learning method proved to be the most suitable followed by the interactive lecture method, the cooperative learning method and the activity method.

Individuals with mental illnesses who experience homelessness have frequent interactions with the criminal justice system. Correctly measuring this involvement is essential to develop and evaluate the efficacy of intervention programs. Criminal justice involvement is typically assessed through administrative records or self-reported accounts. The aims of this study are to: 1) assess agreement between self-report and administrative data related to court appearances, and 2) identify individual characteristics that affect discrepancies between sources. Participants were 468 homeless persons with mental illness from the Montreal site of the At Home/Chez Soi randomized controlled trial, in Canada. Self-reported data was collected through an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Administrative data was collected through provincial and municipal court databases. Overall, agreement was good. Discrepancies were more common among those with a diagnosis of mood disorder with psychotic features, and those with a criminal history. Increased age and interviewer's perception of sincerity and interest increased likelihood of concordance. Generally, high agreement between self-report and administrative data suggests that either source can provide reliable information. Further work to understand predictors of discrepancies could further enhance the quality of data collected through these different sources.

Since other state child welfare agencies may adopt a similar training model, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness of these CSEC trainings. Therefore, in the present study, we used a randomized, control group design to evaluate the effectiveness of a CSEC webinar training program for child protective service (CPS) employees. We discuss our findings and make recommendations for child welfare agencies interested in providing CSEC training to their staff. Given the lack of sophisticated research evaluating the effectiveness of child welfare training programs, in general, and CSEC training programs, more specifically, this study fills a gap in the literature and offers a training model that could be replicated with child protection systems in other states.

In the beginning, we present some elements of the international and Italian legislation referred to the efficacy evaluation and about the child protection. Subsequently this work describes the process of efficacy evaluation of an intervention of minor protection delivered by a public Italian Service, the Minor and Family Service, MiFa. The MADIT Methodology is applied to the efficacy evaluation and it is interested in discursive repertoires, defined as \"a linguistically intended mode of construction of finite reality\". The aim of the research is to show, through the description of every step of the implementation of the Methodology based on text analysis, how is possible to notice if there are progress in the direction of the objective of intervention of child protection. The results describes how from a starting situation of \"first appearance of psychiatric career\" referred to the minor, the work of the psychologist of the Service MiFa has enabled to produce a shifting in the direction of objective of the intervention, that was \"developing the competence of the minor to identify objectives\". Through this work, we show how a rigorous methodology for assessing effectiveness may contribute to improve the quality of service of Minor Protection and may also be suitable for new fields of social science.

This study used outcome data from a sample of participants (N=272) who took the online Parents Forever course between 2012 and 2014. Participants were asked questions about positive and negative co-parenting behaviors as well their levels of conflict before and after the divorce or separation. There was on average a slight increase in conflict from post to follow-up (M=0.397, SD=1.54). Simple linear regression analyses indicated that change in conflict explained a significant proportion of the variance in positive co-parenting scores, Results suggest that conflict significantly impacts co-parenting behaviors targeted in the Parents Forever course.

However, people's reasons for desistance vary considerably. This study evaluated the acceptability, utility, and predictive validity of questions that ask about people's reasons for wanting to successfully complete probation. Substance-using probationers (N=113) participated in a web-based computer intervention that targeted substance use and treatment initiation. Questions around seven dimensions of reasons for completing probation were developed to provide tailored feedback during the web-based program. A principle components factor analysis found that survey items loaded onto two distinct factors. Factor one, \"Tangible Loss\" focused on external and present-focused reasons. Factor two, \"Better Life\" focused on internal and future-focused reasons. There was a significant negative association between Better Life scores and days of substance use after two months (=0.31, SE=0.13, p<0.05). There was a significant positive association with Better Life scores and days of treatment attendance (=1.46, SE=0.26, p<0.001). Tangible Loss scores were no associated with substance use and treatment attendance. These findings may help to create more effective motivational tracks in e-health interventions, and may complement traditional motivation measures with an explicit focus on people's stated reasons for wanting to complete probation.

However, evaluating large-scale collaborative projects is especially difficult as: (i) stakeholders from different countries are involved who, almost inevitably, have diverse technological and/or application domain backgrounds and objectives; (ii) multiple and sometimes conflicting application specific and user-defined requirements exist; and (iii) multiple and often conflicting technological research and development objectives are apparent. In this paper, we share our experiences based on the large-scale integrated research project - The HUMBOLDT project - with project duration of 54 months, involving contributions from 27 partner organisations, plus 4 sub-contractors from 14 different European countries. In the HUMBOLDT project, a specific evaluation methodology was defined and utilised for the user evaluation of the project outcomes. The user evaluation performed on the HUMBOLDT Framework and its associated nine application scenarios from various application domains, resulted in not only an evaluation of the integrated project, but also revealed the benefits and disadvantages of the evaluation methodology. This paper presents the evaluation methodology, discusses in detail the process of applying it to the HUMBOLDT project and provides an in-depth analysis of the results, which can be usefully applied to other collaborative research projects in a variety of domains.

Understanding the perspective of elementary classroom teachers (ECTs) toward MI is critical to program planning for interventions/professional development. This study examined the MI perceptions of ECTs in order to inform the design and implementation of a school-based pilot program that focused in part on increasing children's PA through MI. Twelve ECTs (Grades 1-3) from four schools were selected to participate based on their responses to a survey about their use of MI. Based on the idea that MI programming should be designed with particular attention to teachers who integrate relatively few movement opportunities in their classrooms, the intent was to select the teacher who reported integrating movement the least at her/his respective grade level at each school. However, not all of these teachers agreed to participate in the study. The final sample included two groups of ECTs, including eight lowest integrating teachers and four additional teachers. Each ECT participated in an interview during the semester before the pilot program was implemented. Through qualitative analysis of the interview transcripts, four themes emerged: (a) challenges and barriers (e.g., lack of time), (b) current and ideal resources (e.g., school support), (c) current implementation processes (e.g., scheduling MI into daily routines), and (e) teachers' ideas and tips for MI (e.g., stick with it and learn as you go). The themes were supported by data from both groups of teachers. This study's findings can inform future efforts to increase movement opportunities for children during regular classroom time.

In recent years, an increasing number of health researchers have been studying arts-based interventions to transform knowledge into action. This article reports on the results of an online questionnaire aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a knowledge dissemination intervention (KDI) conveying findings from a study on the scientific and ethical challenges raised by nutrigenomics-nutrigenetics (NGx) research. The KDI was based on the use of four Web pages combining original, interactive cartoon-like illustrations accompanied by text to disseminate findings to Canadian Research Ethics Boards members, as well as to NGx researchers and researchers in ethics worldwide. Information dissemination; Knowledge; Attitude; Practice; of resource-limited evaluations: Lessons from an INGO in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo The emphasis on demonstrable program results in international development work has produced countless evaluation guidelines and numerous scholars have championed specific, ethical-based evaluation approaches to guide international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs). Yet few studies have examined the ethical implications of current evaluation practices among INGOs or the resulting effects on INGO-funded programs. This article focuses on one among a growing population of young, U.S.-based INGOs whose evaluation practices reflect limitations of time, methodological expertise and funding. Drawing on existing principles of ethical evaluations, the author explores the circumstances and potential implications of one evaluation performed by an INGO in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and concludes that an ethically defensible evaluation exceeds the capacity of this young INGO. Four propositions are forwarded to highlight the tensions between currently accepted evaluation guidelines and INGO realities. Finally, to help under-resourced INGOs minimize the potential ethical implications for their programs, the article recommends that they prioritize their limited resources to: (1) build local capacity and decentralize evaluation tasks and responsibilities; (2) share program agendas and solicit feedback on implementation from evaluands; (3) share field impressions with local and expert stakeholders; and, (4) translate communications into local dialects to facilitate discussion about structuring future programs and their evaluation.

MPC was originally designed for inner city, African-American youth in high HIV communities, but implemented recently in diverse settings shown to be at high risk of teen-pregnancy in Missouri. In light of the pressures for local adaptation of the comprehensive sexual education curriculum, we created a three-pronged fidelity assessment tool. We find that significant gains are reported in terms of knowledge as well as intent to use a condom. Furthermore, these findings are consistently achieved in both urban and rural settings, with foster care youth, and for Whites and African-Americans.

Three indicators, level of awareness, frequency of use, and perception of usefulness, were examined according to a firm's export status. The global evaluation suggests that exporters are more frequent users of EPPs and perceive them to be more useful than non-exporters. Nonetheless, both groups demonstrate higher levels of awareness, are frequent users, and perceive the programs relating to export info/knowledge are more usefulness than programs relating to financial assistance. Further analysis also reveals that the frequency of use and the perception of usefulness for most programs are positively related to export experience, but not to export turnover. This study offers insights into the effectiveness of export programs for encouraging export initiation and expansion in an emerging economy.

To evaluate the implementation of programs that provide care for frail older people a Community of Practice (CoP) was developed in the Netherlands. The purpose of this paper is to describe and reflect on the role of a CoP in the implementation of these programs. Using a responsive evaluation approach this study was based on interviews with participating stakeholders and transcripts of the CoP meetings with 13 professionals, project managers and patient representatives. Findings showed that CoP members had unanticipated concerns regarding the pro-active approach of the programs and older people not being open to receiving care. The heterogenic composition was appreciated and fostered learning. A social infrastructure was created for active learning inside and outside the CoP. We conclude that a CoP is a useful strategy as part of an evaluation aimed at improving program implementation. Lessons learned include the importance of creating ownership among CoP members by sharing responsibilities and paying attention to the heterogenic group composition and professional language spoken to involve all members.

This paper reports on the initial implementation and formative evaluation of a journaling program used as a means of communicating health information to pregnant and parenting adolescents (young women age 15-19) while also providing participants with a means of self-expression. The journaling prototype was implemented in a community-based agency in the Midwest by Family Support Specialists (FSSs) who made home visits on a monthly basis to assist pregnant and parenting adolescents (n=52) with successful family planning and public health education. A mixed method approach of qualitative (analysis of journals, field notes, and responses of semi-structured interviews with FSSs) and quantitative (questionnaires from pregnant and parenting adolescent respondents) data with purposive sampling was employed to evaluate the implementation of the journaling intervention. Twenty of the 52 study participants were pregnant when the journaling intervention was implemented, while 32 were not pregnant, but recently had a child and were currently parenting. Two core themes emerged from analysis of the data after the implementation of the journals: (1) usefulness of the journal and responsiveness to participants' information needs and (2) functionality challenges. The results offer practical starting points to tailor the implementation of journaling in other contexts. Further, areas for improvement emerged regarding the distribution timeline for the journal and the content of the journal itself. As such, we discuss the lessons learned through this collaborative project and suggest opportunities for future phases of the journal intervention.

The framework was used to measure the progress of five countries that received direct assistance to strengthen regulations and to benchmark the status of regulations in the 17 countries participating in the initiative. The framework captured meaningful advancements in regulatory strengthening in the five supported countries and the level of regulatory capacity in participating countries. The project uses the framework to assess yearly progress of supported countries, track the overall impact of the project on national and regional nursing regulation, and to identify national and regional priorities for regulatory strengthening. It is the first of its kind to document and measure progress toward sustainably strengthening nursing and midwifery regulation in Africa.

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the progress toward program goals and objectives. This study was a process evaluation. Qualitative data were collected from recipient health departments at two time-points during the program year. Structured, open-ended questions were asked through telephone interviews. This study examined: (1) progress toward program goals and objectives, (2) problems encountered during implementation, and (3) evaluation measures employed to assess program impact. All health departments reported making significant progress toward program goals and objectives and reported successful collaboration with other healthcare providers. The use of breast pumps, educational classes, and professional training of staff were reported as providing the best outcome in the promotion of breastfeeding. The majority of respondents did not measure program impact. From a public health perspective, it is important that infants receive breast milk for the first six months of life. It appears that goals and objectives set a priori guided health departments with the administration of their breastfeeding program. Results may be used to enhance and sustain delivery of breastfeeding support programs in Kansas communities.

However, though the economic costs associated with experiencing such an event are high, the probability of such events occurring is quite low. At the same time, less catastrophic events that temporarily disrupt essential services to local areas, such as water and electricity, are quite common. However, there is little research that documents residents' actual economic costs when their water service is disrupted. In this paper, we contribute to the growing literature assigning economic value to residential water service by documenting the economic costs residents report from routine, small-scale water disruptions through focus groups and in-person interviews. We find that residential impacts ranged from over $1400 in savings (from working more hours than usual and eating out less than usual) to a cost of over $1000, with an overall average of $93.96. These costs, particularly when multiplied over a substantial population, become quite significant and demonstrate the importance of studying the economic costs of such events.

This paper presents a method for analyzing and prioritizing potential evaluations to improve the selection of a portfolio of activities that give the greatest pay-off. The method establishes the relative priority of 'evaluation opportunities' against criteria that relate to the usual primary purposes of an evaluation function. The method was developed in the context of a multilateral organization but is of general utility to the wider evaluation community and, with suitable adaptation can be applied to help ensure that scarce evaluation resources are used to their best advantage.

GFE is an evaluation model where the independent evaluator is intentionally screened from the program's stated goals and objectives in hopes of reducing potential goal-related tunnel vision. The findings from these GFE case studies are focused in three areas: (1) elements of the programs that were evaluated and their existing evaluation contexts (e.g., pre-evaluation conditions, size of evaluation budget), (2) design of the GFEs (e.g., screening method, data collection methods), and (3) expertise of the goal-free evaluators (e.g., training, degrees attained). The findings indicate that, when employed, GFE is used as a qualitative data collection method; and the GFEs conducted have been relatively small in size and scope. The conclusions are that a more explicit operationalization of GFE is needed for increased use, and that systematic and empirical study comparing GFE with other evaluation models is warranted.

Participating RCHs (n=29) were randomized to Early (n=17) or Delayed (n=12) groups from 2004 to 2006 and 2006 to 2008, respectively. Children's PA was measured at three time periods (2004, 2006, 2008). Intent-to-treat analysis revealed no intervention impact on PA. Subsequent analyses used process evaluation data to group organizations into high and low PA-promoting RCHs to compare PA level, controlling for assignment to condition. Organizations with high PA-promoting environments were found to have more active youth. Utility of a comprehensive implementation monitoring plan and the need for formative assessment of organizational capacity is discussed.
