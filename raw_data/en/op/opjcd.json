The Tennessee Vaccine -Preventable Diseases and Immunization Program (VPDIP) uses these results to track progress toward achieving the national Healthy People 2020 (HP2020) objectives for immunizati on coverage with routinely recommended early childhood vaccines. HP2020 is a national framework established by the Fe deral Department of Health and H uman Services (HHS) for meeting health goals by the year 2020. For best results, vaccines should be administered as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Methods The survey is composed of random, statistically -valid samples drawn from birth certificates of infants born during the first quarter of 201 7 in each of Tennessee's six metropolitan counties and seven rural TDH regions . Local or state public health staff attempted to locate each child and confirm immunization histories with parents or guardians and healthcare pro viders. Statewide immunization rates are calculated , as well as rates for the six major metropolitan counties and seven rural multi -county regions. County rates within the rural regions are not calculated due to the small number of children sampled in each county. Complete on -time immunization in the 2019 survey of Tennessee 24 month olds is defined as having received four doses of diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DTaP) vaccine , three doses of polio (IPV) measles, mumps, rubella vaccine , three or four doses of Haemophilus influenza type b (HIB) vaccine (depending on brand received) or any child clinically considered complete on the CDC's \"catch -up\" schedule, three doses of HBV vaccine , one dose of Varicella (Var) vaccine and four doses of pneumococcus ( PCV) vaccine or any child considered complete for PCV based on the CDC's \"ca tch-up\" schedule. Combined these are known as the 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS series. Additionally, this survey analyzes completion of hepatitis A (HAV), rotavirus (RTV), and seasonal influenza (Flu) vaccines. Results There were 1,573 children in the original survey sample and an additional 21 oversampled children for inclusion in the racial disparity analysis. After exclusion of 105 records (87 had moved out of state, two were sealed through adoption or placement in foster care, and one child had died) the final sample of 1,468 children was analyzed . Of the 1,468 children analyzed , 76.6% were fully immunized for the 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS vaccination series. There wa s no statistically significant difference in the series completion rates between black and white children; however, black children continue to be significantly under -immunized against influenza compared to their white peers (35.3% compared to 50.0%, respec tively). Vaccine exemptions continue to increase; 4.2% (n=61) of parents claimed vaccine exemptions in 2019 with the majority of parents citing religious exemptions. At the end of the decade, Tennessee was able to meet only three of the 12 Healthy People 2 020 objective s: PCV (91.9%), HBV (91.4%), and IPV (91.0%) . In 2018, Tennessee met Healthy People 2020 objectives for five of the 12 antigens: IPV (90.8%). Because Healthy People 2020 evaluates two doses of HAV by 35 months of age and the 24 Month Old survey assesses one dose at age 24 months, comparison is no longer made between HAV and the HP2020 objective as of the 2019 report. The following table summarizes Tennessee's 2019 results alongside nat ional Healthy People 2020 objectives: 24 MONTH OLD SURVEY - 2019 7 Antigen HP2020 objective (19-35 months) Tennessee 2019 (24 months) Diphtheria, N/A *87.7 % Rotavirus (RTV) 80% 77.3 % Influenza (Flu) 70% 47.7 % Indicates value is above HP2020 objective . *Hepatitis A is excluded from HP2020 objective comparisons as Tennessee measures receipt of one dose, while the HP2020 objective goal references two doses. Comparison to National Rates The National Immunization Survey -Child (NIS -Child) is an annual survey conducted by the CDC to assess ACIP recommended vaccination coverage of children 19 -35 months. The 24 Month Old -Survey assesses coverage of the same ACIP vaccinations at 24 months of age. According to 2019 NIS -Child results, Tennessee children only met the HP2020 objective for polio with a coverage rate at 90.3%. Nationwide, children met four of to the 2019 NIS -Child survey, Tennessee ranks in the bottom 20% of states for vaccine series completion of DTaP, HBV, birth dose HBV, HIB, PCV, MMR, and the 4:3:1:FS:3:1:4 series. Tennessee ranks in the bottom 40% of states for the remaining antigens: HAV, Flu, VAR, Polio, and RTV .1 Antigen NIS-Child 2019 TN NIS-Child 2019 NIS -Child evaluates receipt of 2 or 3 doses, depending on product type received. 24 Month Old S urvey accounts for brand and doses needed if first dose was after ACIP -recommend ed age, but before 24 months NIS -Child evaluates receipt of 4 doses. 24 -Month Old survey accounts for doses needed if 1st dose was after ACIP recommendation but before 24 months of age Both NIS -Child and 24 -Month Ol d Survey results reported are for one dose of HAV as of 24 months of age 24 MONTH OLD SURVEY - 2019 8 Racial Disparity Influenza vaccination rates continue to be significantly lower among black children compared to white children. In 2019 , 35.3 % of black children received at least two doses of influenza vaccine compared to 50.0 % of white children. Although completion of the full childhood series (4 :3:1:FS:3:1:FS) has been consistently lower for black children than white children, the difference is not statistically significant. The 2019 series completion rate among blacks and whites was 73.3 and 77.3 %, respectively. Influenza Vaccination Children six months through eight years of age require two doses of the influenza vaccine in their first season; thus, they should have received three doses prior to the second bir thday. The percentage of infants receiving two and three doses of influenza vaccine in Tennessee has been variable. In 2018 , two dose coverage increased from 45.9% to 49.0% and three dose coverage increased from 25.6% to 27.0 %. However, i n 2019, two dose coverage decreased from 49.0% to 47.4%, and three dose coverage decreased from 27.0% to 26.0%. Trends in Vaccination Refusals Over the past 5 years, percentage of children included in the survey whose parents refused some or all immunizations has ranged from 1.6% to 3.5%. This 2019 survey marks the first year in the history of the survey where vaccine refusals have risen above 4%, with 4.2% (61/1468 ) of parents refusing some or all immunizations. The number of medical refusals in Tennessee has remained low over the past five years (< 1%) , while religious and philosophical refusals have continued to rise. In 2019, 2.2% (n=33) of refusals were religious and 1.7% (n= 25) were philosophical refusals. Discussion While overall vaccination rates among children in Tennessee remain relatively high, the reintroduction of previously eliminated vaccine -preventable diseases across the United States emphasizes the importance of continued vigilance in ensuring that every me dically -eligible child is fully vaccinated on- time and according to the ACIP and CDC recommended childhood vaccination schedule. Tennessee currently meets HP2020 targets for only three of 12 measures in 24 month old children and ranks among the bottom 20% of states for completion of six of the 12 vaccines assessed , as well as the 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS series. Furthermore, the increasing percentage of parents who are refusing immunizations is placing all Tennesseans at greater risk for significant morbidity and mortality from vaccine -preventable diseases. 24 MONTH OLD SURVEY - 2019 9 Definitions of Abbreviations in Charts 1.

The s urvey is composed of random, statistically -valid samples drawn from birth certificates of infants born in each of the 13 health department regions, which are aggregated to give statewide statistics on immunization coverage rates in Tennessee. Safety and E fficacy of Immunizations The United States has the safest and most effective vaccine supply in its history. Prior to licensure, rigorous clinical trials are carried out by the vaccine manufacturer s and reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) . Vaccines are recommended only when proven to be safe, effective, and beneficial. After licensure , vaccines continue to be monitored for rare adverse reactions. The majority of vaccinated children never experience an adverse reaction to a vaccine. The most frequently reported adverse reactions are minor and include soreness at injection site, a rash, or a mild fever that subsides within a day or two2. Vaccines help the body build immunity against disease. Because of the success of vaccines, many diseases that were historically common place have become rare or have been eliminated from the United States. By vaccinating a child, benefits also extend to other s. Individuals who cannot develop immunity from vaccines, have medical conditions that do not allow them to be vaccinated, and babies who are too young to be vaccinated rely on the immunity of those around them to protect them from serious infectious diseases.3 Value of Immunizations Timely routine vaccination of children protects health, saves money, and saves lives. The federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, implemented in 1994, assures affordable access to all routine vaccines for children who are without private insurance cov erage. In Tennessee, over 600 providers across the state are administering VFC vaccines and there is at least one VFC provider in each of Tennessee's 95 counties. The CDC has reported that the routine vaccines already given to U.S. children born between 19 94 and 2013 will prevent an average of 4.1 illnesses per child, prevent the hospitalization of one in four and prevent the premature death of nearly one in 100 of these children over their lifetimes.4 The CDC calculates that vaccination of each U.S. birth cohort according to the current immunization schedule yields a net savings of nearly $14 billion in direct medical costs and $69 billion in total costs to society.5 With roughly two percent of the U.S. population living in Tennessee, this suggests Tennessee has benefitted from the prevention of approximately 480,000 cases of disease in the past decade, with annual savings of $280 million in direct medical costs and $1.38 billion in total costs to society. In Tennessee specifically, unvaccinated and under -vaccinated children have comprised substantial proportions of cases of vaccine -preventable diseases such as measles, mumps, and pertussis (whooping cough), and the majority of children who die each year fro m seasonal influenza are unvaccinated.6,7 These diseases not only place Tennesseans at risk for significant morbidity and mortality, but also create significant fiscal burden upon the State. A 2016 outbreak of seven cases of measles in west Tennessee, for example, resulted in an estimated cost of more than $4 million. Even small outbreaks place tremendous strain upon our public health system and its resources and divert attention from other crit ical public health initiatives. Vaccines A ssessed This survey assesses vaccine completion according to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ' (ACIP) recommendations for protection against ten serious illnesses before the age of 24 months: diphtheria, tetanus , pertussis (combined as DTaP), poliomyeli measles, mumps, rubella (combined as MM R), Haemophilus influenza type B (HIB), hepatitis B (HBV), v aricella (Var), and pneumococcus (PCV). Combined , these are known as 24 MONTH OLD SURVEY - 2019 11 the 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS series8. Additionally, this survey ana lyzes completion of hepatitis A (HAV), rotavirus (RTV), and seasonal influenza (Flu) vaccines. Table 1. ACIP List of Diseases to Prevent through Vac cination of C hildren < 24 Months of Age Disease(s) Possible complications of disease Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis Diphtheria : upper airway obstruction, pneumonia, respiratory failure, death Tetanus : spasms of respiratory and skeletal muscles, death Pertussis : outbreaks; severe, long -term cough, vomiting, breathlessness, death in infants Poliomyelitis Paralysis, death Measles, Mumps, Rubella outbreaks; death Mumps : outbreaks; decreased fertility , impairment Rubella: arthritis, birth defects Haemophilus influenzae type B Pneumonia, meningitis, neurologic problems, death Hepatitis B Fulminant hepatitis, jaundice, liver cancer, cirrhosis, premature death Varicella (chickenpox) Rash illness, severe disease in immunocompromised, birth defects , encephalitis, death Pneumococcus (certain strains) Ear infections, pneumonia, meningitis, blood stream infections, death Hepatitis A Outbreaks: fever, nausea, jaundice, death Influenza Outbreaks: secondary pneumonia, exacerbation of chronic diseases, hospitalizations, death Rotavirus Outbreaks in daycare settings, dehydration, hospitalization , death Special Vaccine Considerations Hepatitis A vaccine (HAV) HAV is a two -dose series, starting on or after the first birthday. As the recommended dose spacing is 6 -18 months, children who have only one dose by the second birthday are still on schedule. For this reason, this survey reports 24 Month Old children as up- to-date with one dose of HAV. HAV will not be compared to HP2020 objecti ves in this report, as the HP2020 objective reflects completion of the 2 -dose series. Hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) birth dose In 2016, the CDC revised its guidance to recommend routine administration of a hepatitis B birth dose within 24 hours of life (rather than prior to discharge). A birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine is defined in the 24 Month Old survey as a dose given within the first three days of life. Birth dose hepatitis B is a key strategy to eliminate transmission of the hepatitis B virus from an infected mother to her infant. 24 MONTH OLD SURVEY - 2019 12 Influenza vaccine (FLU) Influenza vaccine (FLU) is given annually to children aged six months and older ; two doses should be given during a child's first influenza season. Because prot ection is conferred only after two doses, this survey measures the proportion of children who have received two or more doses by their second birthday. Haemo philus influenzae type B vaccine (HIB) Two HIB schedules exist, depending upon the vaccine used. The full series (FS) of the Merck product requires three doses; the FS of the Sanofi Pasteur product requires four doses. Any mixed -brand schedule requires fou r doses. Any child receiving one or more doses of the 4 -dose HIB product must have received four doses before the 25th month of life in order to be considered complete and on -time. This classification by HIB products administered reduces the degree of overestimation of on -time completion demonstrated by past reports. Rotavirus vaccine (RTV) Similarly to HIB vaccine, two rotavirus vaccine products are available with different dosing schedules. Rotateq\u00a9 (Merck), requires three doses; Rotarix\u00a9 (GSK) require s two doses. Mixed brand schedules require three doses. RTV is unique among vaccines as the series must be initiated no later than 15 weeks of age and no doses should be given after eight months of age. Healthy People 2020 objectives Healthy People 2020 ( HP2020 ) objectives are established by the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide national targets for population health. These objectives include vaccine coverage levels among children 19 -35 months of age and are tracked national ly through the National Immunization Survey (NIS) . TDH aims to reach or exceed each of these targets . The following objectives for the percentage of children immunized between 19-35 months of age have been established by HP2020 and are relevant compariso ns to the results of this survey: 80% complete the 4:3:1:FS:3:1: FS series 90% complete each individual vaccine included in the 4:3:1:FS:3:1 :FS series 80% complete rotavirus vaccina tion with two or more doses 70% complete influenza vaccination with two or more doses 85% of all children receive their first dose of hepatitis B vaccine within three days of life Methods In each of the 13 public health jurisdictions in Tennessee, 121 children born in the first three months of 2017 were sampled. Oversampling for black children was done in each region where the random sample contained fewer black children than the actual proportion of black children born in the first quarter of 2017 in that region. Vaccine informatio n made available through the Tennessee Immunization Information System (TennIIS) for all sampled children is provided to l ocal or state public health staff. These staff then attempt to locate each child and confirm immunization histories with parents or gu ardians and healthcare providers. All information is tracked in a secure, online database system, REDCap. 24 MONTH OLD SURVEY - 2019 13 Vaccine Completion L ogic Complete on -time immunization in this survey is defined as having received four doses of DTaP vaccine , three doses of IPV vaccine , one dose of MMR vaccine , three or four doses of HIB vaccine (depending on brand received or any child clinically considered complete on a \"catch -up\" schedule ), three doses of HBV vaccine , one dose of VAR vaccine and four doses of PCV vaccine (or any child considered complete for PCV based on the CDC's \"catch -up\" schedule ). Prior 2014, Haemophilus influenzae type B (HIB) and rotavirus (RTV) vaccination were counted as complete with three doses or two doses, respectively, as bran d information was unavailable. Beginning in 2014, a change in methodology was introduced to provide a more accurate assessment of HIB vaccination and RTV vaccination rates, as different formulations of vaccines require different numbers of doses. This survey now takes into account the vaccine brand, if known, and classifies a child as complete only if the appropriate number of doses has been administered. If any documented HIB dose was given as the 4 -dose product, then only receipt of four doses was considered as a complete series. In the absence of documentation of vaccination brand, receipt of four doses of HIB is classified as series completion. Likewise, if any documented RTV dose was given as the 3 -dose product, then only receipt of three doses was considered as a complete series. In the absence of documentation of vaccination brand, three doses of RTV is classified as a complete series. As a result, point estimates for HIB a nd RTV coverage rates are lower than previous estimates, but also more accurate and more consistent with methods used by the CDC. In 2019, additional analysis was included to account for the HIB and PCV catch -up schedules. Prior to 2019, counts of vaccinations were used to calculate series completion for both HIB and PCV; however, this inaccurately capture d completion for these vaccines due to the unique vaccination schedules that exist when a child receives their first dose after the recommended ag e, but prior to 24 months . By assessing completion based off of dosing needs from the first vaccination event, HIB and PCV completeness more a ccurately mirrors ACIP forecasting and clinical decision- making. Table 2. Catch -Up Guidance for PCV and HIB, Cen ters for Disease Control and Prevention9 Age at Dose 1 Age at Dose 2 Age at Dose 3 Recommendation PCV < 12 months old < 12 months old < 12 months old Needs 4th dose 8 weeks later < 12 months old Between 7 -11 months old Needs 3rd dose 8 weeks later > 12 months old Needs 2nd dose 8 weeks later 24-25 months No additional dose needed HIB < 12 months old < 12 months old < 12 months old Needs 4th dose 8 weeks later < 12 months old Between 12 -14 months old Needs 3rd dose 8 weeks later < 12 months old > 15 months old No additional dose needed Between 12 -14 months Needs 2nd dose 8 weeks later > 15 months old No additional dose needed Program Enrollment The survey captures the immunizing provider type (public, private or both), TennCare (Medicaid) participation, and enrollment in the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) n utrition program for each child. Children are counted 24 MONTH OLD SURVEY - 2019 14 under TennCare or WIC if they were ever enrolled in these programs. Infants in WIC have immunization records reviewed at WIC visits. Targeted education and telephone follow- up are the primary tools used to encourage catch -up immunization of WIC infants. Statistical N otes The survey is designed to allow valid statistical comparisons of the populations in each of the 13 health department regions; however, the sample size within multi -county regions is too small for meaningful results at the county level or useful comparisons among subpopulations within a region. Ninety -five percent confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and are displayed as grey bands on the graphs in this report to permit readers to visualize the statistical significance (or absence of significance) of differences in point estimates. Confidence intervals that do not overlap indicate that the point -estimate s being compared have at least a 95% chance of representing true differences in the populations being compared (statistically significantly different) . When CIs overlap, differences are not considered to be statistically significant. Sampling Comparison Limitation For the seven multi -county TDH regions (Northeast [NER], East Tennessee [ETR], [SCR], Mid -Cumberland [MCR], West Tennessee [WTR]) in this survey, children were chosen in different proportions from the counties that make up each region . There is no consistent pattern for choosing these participants from year to year. Results are presented as the summation of all counties in that region; therefore , use of the results of this survey for county -level estimates is not appropriate . Results The 2019 Sample P opulation In 2019, the statewide sample consisted of 1,573 children and an additional 21 black children for inclusion in the racial disparity analysis. Children who moved out of the state , for whom the birth record was sealed (e.g. through adoption or placement in foster care) , for whom the parents or guardi ans refused to participate in the survey , and children who had died were excluded from the survey . Of the 1, 573 sampled births, 105 records were excluded from the final analysis: one child had died; parents of 15 refused to participate; 87 had moved out of state; and two had been adopted, put in foster c are or were in state's custody. None of the 21 oversampled children were excluded from the racial disparity analysis. The point estimates reported in this survey were based off of the 1,468 analyzed sample population; the 1,573 sampled births minus the 105 excluded records. When reporting on racial analysis, the oversampled population is included in the denominator . Due to small sample size, children of other races (n=29 or 2% of children sam pled ) were not included in analysis. The final number of children included in the racial analysis sample was 1,460 (1,468 + 21 oversampled records - 29 other races = 1,460 total records). The children sampled were 81.3% white, 16.7 % black, and 2% other races . 8.4% (125) considered themselves Hispanic/Latino. This survey does not differentiate between Hispanic whites and non -Hispanic whites ; for that reason, racial disparity based upon Hispanic ethnicity was not analyzed. The majority ( 81.9 %) of children received all of their vaccinations at a private provider office, while 14.4 % received vaccinations from both a health department and a private provider, and 3. 7% of children received vaccinations at a health department alone. 64.6 % of children had been enrolled in TennCare, 5 6.5% had been enrolled in WIC, and 52 .2% had been enrolled in both TennCare and WIC. Nearly one -third (29.6%) of all mothers of sampled children had a high -school diploma , 14.8% had less than a high -school diploma , and 55.6% had more than a high -school diploma . The father' s education level was unknown for 16%, 12% had less than a high -school diploma , 30% had a high -school diploma , and 42% had more than a 24 MONTH OLD SURVEY - 2019 15 high -school diploma . Of the 1 ,468 children, 573 (39%) ha d no siblings, 493 (33.6%) had one sibling, and 402 (27.4%) had two or more siblings; the number of siblings is known to impact completion of vaccines. Table 3.

Non -Compliance Vaccine Refusals There were 61 (4.2%) documented vaccine refusals reported in 2019; this is the highest number of vaccine refusals reported since this survey's inception. Thirty -three claimed religious exemption, twenty -five claimed philosophical objection, and three claimed a medical exemption. Regionally, vaccine -refusals ranged from 1.7% t o 11.3% of the sampled population s. Nine of the 61 children whose parents refused vaccines were partially immunized (ranging from 3 -26 total doses). Parents of six of the nine partially immunized children c ited philosophical reasons and three cited medical reasons for refusal of vaccines. There has been an annual incremental increase in parents refusing immunizations. While medical refusals have remained consistent over the past five years ( 5% of refusals year), refusals for philosophical and r eligious reasons have increased, with religious exemptions increasing at a higher rate than philosophical exemptions. In 2015, parents of 10 (0.7%) children claimed religious exemption compared to 25 (1.7%) in 2019, and parents of 17 (1.1%) children claimed philosop hical exemption compared to 33 (2.2%) in 2019. 24 MONTH OLD SURVEY - 2019 16 Table 4.

(See Table 5 for the breakdown of those unable to be located by region.) TDH uses Accurint, a subscription -based database compiling publicly available address information, to generate contact details for parents of each child. These were provided to local and regional health department staff at the beginning of the survey period. Table 5.

While coverage has fluctuated slightly over the years, no statistically significant changes have been observed. 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS series rates in 2019 include d catch -up HIB and catch -up PCV completion for those who received first dose after the ACIP recommended age but before 24 months. The ove rall statewide coverage estimate for the full, recommended 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS series was 76.6% (95% CI: 74.4 - 78.7) and is shown in Figure 3 . The light blue bars represent the individual antigens that make up the 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS series, the navy bar is the 4:3 :1:FS:3:1:FS, and the dark grey bars represent the additional antigens assessed in the survey. The red lines represent HP2020 objective s for each antigen assessed, and the lighter grey bands represent the 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). Figure 4 shows the statewide and regional percentages of children immunized on -time with all vaccines in the 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS series. Among the lowest completed vaccinations are DTaP and HIB, both of which require a final dose after 12 months of age. Influenza vaccination rates remain low with 47.4% of children having received at least two doses. The first dose of HAV vaccine was received by 87.7% (95% CI: 86.0 -89.3) of children by 24 months of age. 24 MONTH OLD SURVEY - 2019 18 Figure 2. 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS Immunization Rate Trends, Tennessee, 2015 - 2019 Full Series The statewide and regional percentages of children immunized on -time with all vaccines in the 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS series are shown in Figure 3 . Statewide series completion was 76.6% (95% CI, 74.4 -78.7 ). No region was statistically significantly different from the statewide completion rate . Southeast region, Knox County region, and Northeast Region were the only regions with point -estimates meeting the HP2020 objective of 80%.

Percent of 24 Month Old Children With On -Time 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS Series, by Health Department Region (point estimate and 95% confidence intervals, n=1468) Progress towards Healthy People 2020 O bjective s In 2019, Tennessee met HP2020 objective s for three of the 1 2 vaccinations evaluated: p olio (91.0 %), hepatitis B (91.4%), and PCV (91.9%). The HP2020 objective for HAV is based upon completion of the two- dose series; however, TN only measures one dose of HAV because children who receive the first dose by their 2nd birthday may wait up to 18 months to receive dose two. A s a result , the survey rate is not comparable to the HAV HP2020 objective . In 2019, Tennessee met three HP2020 objective s compared to five out of 12 in 2018. While Tennessee maintained HP2020 objective s of greater than 90% complet ion for both p olio and hepatitis B vaccines, MMR vaccination dropped from 90.1% to 88.3% and v aricella dropped from 90.3% to 87.3%. Completion rate for PCV increased from 82.4% to 91.9%. Tennessee did not met the HP2020 objective of 80% completion of the 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS series in any year of the past decade. The majority of vaccine coverage rate s decreased over the past decade. Polio and hepatitis B are the only vaccination rates that remained above the HP2020 objective of 90% for the entire decade. MMR, v aricella, and H IB rates achieved HP2020 objective s at some point within the past decade but did not meet objectives in 2019. Flu and DTaP are the only two vaccines that have consistently been below the HP2020 objective every year of the past decade. With the exception of 2019, PCV was also below the HP2020 objective every. Notable increases in both HIB and PCV rates in 2019 are likely attributed to implementation of new completion logic which accounts for unique catch -up schedules. 24 MONTH OLD SURVEY - 2019 20 Figure 4.

These complications include pneumonia, dehydration, acerbation of chronic illnesses (such as asthma), brain dysfunction (encephalopathy), and death. During the 2017 -18 flu season, 187 children were reported as dying from influenza within the United States; however, the CDC estimates that number may be as high as 600 children.10 The annual seasonal influenza vaccine helps save lives. Influenza vaccine was shown to reduce the risk of pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admissions by 74% from 2010 -2012. During the 2017 -18 flu season, proper flu vaccination of all people prevented an estimated 6.2 million influenza illnesses, 3.2 million influenza -associated medical v isits, 91,000 hospitalizations, and 5,700 influenza associated deaths11. Despite its benefits, influenza vaccine remains the least administered of the recommended immunizations in Tennessee. 60.6% of all children surveyed had at least one dose of seasonal influenza vaccine, 47.4% had two, and 26.0% received the recommended three doses of influenza vaccine prior to the second birthday. Figure 7. Percentage and Count of Children with Zero, One, Two, or Three Seasonal Influenza Vaccine in the First 24 Months of Age, Tennessee, 2019 (point estimates and 95% confiden ce intervals, n=1468) Seasonal Influenza Vaccine in First Year of Life Of the 1,468 children surveyed, 48.5% (95% CI: 45.9 -51.0) received their first flu vaccine between 6 months and one year of age. Nashville- Davidson region was the only health department region with statistically significantly more children who received their first dose of influenza vaccine between 6 months and one year of age (62.8%, 95%CI: 53. 8-77.9) compared to Tennessee as a whole. 24 MONTH OLD SURVEY - 2019 23 Figure 8. Perc entage of Children Who R eceived First Dose of I nfluenza Vaccine in First Year of Life, by Health Departme nt Region, Tennessee, 2019 (point estimate and 95% CI, n=1468) Racial Disparity All racial analysis reports include the 21 oversampled children . The 2019 survey population included 266 black and 1,194 white children. Due to small numbers, children of other races (n= 29) w ere excluded from this analysis. This survey does not differentiate between Hispanic whites and non -Hispanic whites ; for that reason, racial disparity involving Hispanic ethnicity wa s not analyzed . The final sample for racial analysis consisted of 1,460 children. Black children were less likely to be fully immunized for six of the twelve recommended CDC vaccinations and statistically significantly less immunized against Flu and RTV compared to their white peers. Only 70.7% of black children were properly immunized with RTV vaccine compared to 78.8% of white children, and 35.3% of black children were immunized against influenza compared to 50% of white children. Of the 1,194 white children, 77.3% (95% CI: (95%CI: 67.9 -78.7) of the 266 black children completed the series. 2018 was the first time in the last five years in which there was a decrease in the racial disparity of 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS immunization rates between black and white children; this trend cont inued in 2019. The racial disparity in the overall 4:3:1:FS:3:1: FS series was driven by the disparity in the DTaP completion rates. Black children were less likely to be fully immunized on time with DTaP ( 75.6 % black vs. 81.1 % white) , although this diffe rence was not statistically significant . 2019 was the first year that black children had a higher rate of PCV immunization than whites, with 93.6% complete vs 91.8% of white children; this could suggest more black children are being vaccinated after the AC IP recommended age but before their second birthday. 24 MONTH OLD SURVEY - 2019 24 Black children also had higher vaccination completion rates for polio and hepatitis B than did whites ; 91.3% compared to 91.0% for polio and 93.2% compared to and 91.1% for hepatitis B, respectively.

This difference has been documented annually sin ce the first assessment of influenza coverage rates in 2007. In 2019, 35.3% (95% CI: 29.6 - 42.7 ) of black children received at least two doses of influenza vaccine compared to 50.0% (95% CI: 47.2 -53.6 ) of white children. Figure 1 1.

Of the 1,468 surveyed children, 48.5% received their first dose between 6 months and one year of age. White children were more likely to receive their first dose of influenza vaccine before their first birthday than black children (50.8% compared to 36.8 %, respectively). Figure 12.

The number s of children enrolled in TennCare and WIC are not mutually exclusive of each other. In 2019, children who were covered by TennCare and WIC had 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS series completion rates that were not significantly different from their non -enrolled peers. Of those enrolled in TennCare, (95% CI: 72.4 -78.2) of WIC enrollees were complete 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS series compared to 78.2% (95% CI: 75.0 -81.4) not enrolled Immunization Source 1138 (81.9%) children sampled were immunized by a private medical provider, 200 (14.4%) children sampled were immunized by a health department only, and 51 (3.7%) children sampled w ere immunized by both a private provider and a health department. Children who received vaccines exclusively from a private provider were statistically significantly more likely to be fully vaccinated (82.0%) compared to children vaccinated by a health department only (60.8%) or by a combination of private pr ovider and health department (74.0%). 24 MONTH OLD SURVEY - 2019 27 Figure 13. Comparison of Children C omplete for the 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS S eries by Immunization P rovider Type, Tennessee, 2019 (point estimate and 95% confidence intervals, n=1468) Children immunized in health departments were more likely to have risk factors for failure to receive immunization s compared to children who were only immunized by private providers . These risk factors include black race, having two or more siblings and re ceipt of a first dose of any vaccine (except RTV and birth dose of hepatitis B) after the 120th day of life. Table 6.

Of the children surveyed, 98.8% (1,111) began immunizations prior to 4 months of age and 80.6% of those children were completely immunized for the 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS series by 24 months of age , com pared to 59.1% (n= 13) o f the 22 children who began immunizations after 4 months of age . Impact of Siblings on Immunization Completion Of the 1 ,468 children included in the survey, 573 (39.0%) had no siblings, 493 (33.6%) had one sibling, and 402 (27.4%) had two or more siblings. As the number of siblings increased, there was a statistically significant decrease in the percentage of children who were complete for the 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS series. While 87.1% (95% CI: 24 MONTH OLD SURVEY - 2019 28 84.3 -89.8) of children with no siblings were complete, only 73.4% with two or more siblings achieved series completion . Figure 1 4.

The c omplete DTaP immunization rates had at least three doses of DTaP. The regional differences between receipt of three doses of DTaP vaccine compared to receipt of four doses of DTaP vaccine ranges from 8.0% to 20.9% . In order for a child to be properly protected against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, a 4th dose of DTaP is necessary between 15 -18 months of age. If all children who had received 3 doses of DTaP had received their fourth dose, Tennessee would have met the HP2020 objective for DTaP immunization (90%). Figure 15.

Of these, 147 (48.2 %) were considered complete for HIB vaccine . Of the 204 children vaccinated with PCV after the CDC recommended age, 180 (61.2%) were considered complete for PCV vaccine . When the catch -up schedule is considered, Tennessee exceeds the HP2020 objective for PCV vaccine coverag e. 24 MONTH OLD SURVEY - 2019 30 Figure 16.

Tennessee has not met HP2020 objective s for the 4:3:1:FS:3:1:FS at any point in the past decade; polio and hepatitis B have remained above the HP2020 objective of 90% for the entire decade Black children were statistically significantly less lik ely than white children to be completely immunized for RTV and Flu . Black children were more likely to be completely immunized for PCV compared to their white peers. 4.2% of surveyed parents reported refusing some or all immunizations, compared to 3. 2% of parents in 201 8. There has been a trend of increasing philosophical and religious exemptions for the past five years; this trend has also been observed in other states and is of concern due t o the increased risk of vaccine- preventable disease among groups of unimmunized and under -immunized children. 24 MONTH OLD SURVEY - 2019 32 Discussion While overall vaccination rates among children in Tennessee remain high, the reintroduction of previously eliminated vaccine -preventable diseases across the United States emphasizes the importance of continued vigilance in ensuring that every medically -eligible child is fully vaccinated on- time and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended childhood immunization schedule. Tennessee currently meets HP2020 targets for only four of 12 vaccination -related measures for 24 month old children. The vast majority of parents in Tennessee vaccinate their children. Of the 1 ,468 children surveyed, 4. 2% (61) reported objectio n or exemptions. Religious exemption was cited by 54 % of t hose objecting immunizations, philosophical exemption was cited by 41% of those objecting immunizations, and medical exemption was cited by 5% of those objecting immunizations. As Tennessee law allo ws only religious and medical exemptions in lieu of complete immunization as required for public school entry, philosophical objections often transition to religious exemptions prior to school entry. Three elements are critical to ensuring that every med ically -eligible child in Tennessee is fully immunized on-time and according to the CDC's recommended childhood vaccination schedule: Parental and community education and messaging around the safety, efficacy and critical importance of childhood immunization Ready access to, and provision of, immunizations at every opportunity Reliable and readily accessible immunization records that ensure immunizations are provided on -time while avoiding duplication Key Strategies for I mproving Immunization Rates Among 24 Month O ld Children Parental and community education and messaging around the safety, efficacy and critical impo rtance of childhood immunization Parents should be skeptical of information posted to social media and refer to credible sources vaccine information and their child's medical provider when seeking information about vaccines. The ability of public health and healthcare providers to provide a strong and credible message that \"vaccines are safe, vaccines are effective, and vaccines sa ve lives\" is critical to ensuring the protection of Tennesseans of all ages. Ready access to, and provision of, vaccinations at every opportunity The federally -funded Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program ensures that children who are covered by TennCare or otherwise lack insurance coverage for vaccines are able to receive them free of charge through a statewide network of healthcare providers and local departments of health. Expansion of this network of VFC Providers will provide more opportunities to vacci nate children. Providers should review vaccine records and administer missing vaccinations at every opportunity. The Tennessee Immunization Information System (TennIIS) is built with the ACIP forecaster for each child. Physicians should utilize TennIIS to identify gaps in immunizations, especially DTaP and Flu , at every opportunity . Reliable and readily accessible vaccination records that ensure vaccinations are provided on -time while avoiding duplication The Tennessee Immunization Information System, \"Te nnIIS\" ( www.TennesseeIIS.gov ) is an online immunization registry that is available to all immunizing providers, including hospitals, clinics and 24 MONTH OLD SURVEY - 2019 33 pharmacies, and includes a suite of tools which may help to improve immunization rates among children and adults. Standards implemented in 2017 require clinics participating in the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program report all immunizations administered to children under 19 years of age to TennIIS. This enables providers to use system features designed to improve patient immunization services, such as vaccine forecasting, practice -based patient reminders and immunization coverage rate reports. Reporting all immunizations to an Immunization Information System (IIS) such as TennIIS improves healthcare by establishing a permanent immunization record that is available to all healthcare providers. TennIIS is linked to the electronic health record (EHR) systems of hundreds of medical facilities and pharmacies statewide, allowing for seamless electronic immunization record reporting from those systems. TennIIS provides providers with a validated immunization certificate, which families use for daycare, school, college entry, and employment requirements. Provider participa tion in TennIIS is critical to build these lifelong records. Policy States that have eliminated non -medical exemptions have benefited from higher overall immunization rates than states which allow non -medical exemptions. Recommendations to Improve Immuni zation Coverage in 24 Month Old Children The following recommendations may improve on-time immunization of Tennessee children: 1. Provider p ractices should implement strategies that remind parents when their children are due or overdue for booster doses of DTaP, HIB and PCV. Most children who fell short of complete immunization could have achieved series completion with just one additional immunization visit prior to the second birthday . Minority children are especially vulnerable to missing immunizations . 2. Parents and providers should strictly adhere to the early infant schedule of immuni zations at 2 -, 4-, and 6 - months. Doing so will enable providers to administer the 4th DTaP and all other needed immunizations as early as the first birthday, maximizing the number of opportunities to immunize children on time. 3. Providers should continue to strive to improve immunization rates. The Tennessee Immunization Information System (TennIIS ) maintains patient immunization records and special tools which may assist providers in improving the quality of their immunization services. Use of user guides and other TennIIS resources available through the training information posted at www.TennesseeIIS.gov may assist providers in recognizing opportunities to immunize their patients. a. TennIIS provides individual patient forecasting of immunizations due, based upon the patient's immunization history . b. TennIIS is able to generate patient reminders through the use of manual, autodialer, text or other reminder methods . This feature assists providers in reminding patients of immunization appointments and recall ing children who are due or overdue for immun izations . c. Practices may run their own practice -level immunization coverage reports based on their active patients in TennIIS. Coaching on the use of these reports is available in the training section of TennIIS. d. There are more than 5,600 private provider offices enrolled in TennIIS. All immunizing providers should enroll and report immunizations to TennIIS. This will allow for more accurate shared clinical decision making and the most complete immunization record for Tennesseans. 4. VPDIP provides local health departments (LHDs) with lists of children aged 20 -24 months who have received immunizations in a LHD and whose records show they are incompletely immunized with DTaP vaccine. These reports facilitate LHD efforts to recall tho se chil dren who are incompletely immunized . 24 MONTH OLD SURVEY - 2019 34 5. Patients enrolled in WIC and TennCare should continue to receive immunization education , immunization record review, and immunization administration at every opportunity. 6. VPDIP will broadly communicate the results of th is survey to public health leaders, VFC program participants and professional or ganizations, including immunizing providers. The VPDIP program should continue to identify opportunities to provide VFC providers with immunization education and strategies to improve immunization coverage across the state. 7. The importance of continuous quality improvement should be emphasized and providers should be encouraged to participate in individualized quality improvement. The VFC Quality Assurance team and immunization field staff in each regional and metro public health department provide practice -level quality assessments and feedback to VFC providers with the lowest rates of 4th DTaP completion. 8. The public should be continually reminded of the morbidity and mortality associated with seasonal influenza. Barriers to universal influenza immunization should be continuously addressed and eliminated. 9. VPDIP should continue to seek partnerships with external organizations, such as the Tennessee Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, TennCare, and Federally Qualified Rural Health Clinics (FQHCs) to ensure every medically -eligible child is immunized on time. 1 CDC.
