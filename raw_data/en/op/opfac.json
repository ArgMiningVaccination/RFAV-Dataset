Northwestern is squarely on that listof 10 top universities. This is a landmark acknowledge-ment of the University's steady rise in quality of instruc-tion and research, educational resources, financial health,and visibility. Such recognition necessarily arrives afterthe fact: External reputation has now caught up to cam-pus realities. It validates Northwestern's course over thepast 20 years, both our achievements and our commit-ment to reviewing periodically the performance of eachprogram and finding ways to make it better. After the fact, too, is the acknowledgement of the accom- plishments of Northwestern alumni. Y our activities inprofessions, government, voluntary organizations, educa-tion, and other sectors demonstrate to the larger worldthe caliber of students recruited in the past \u2014 their energy, ingenuity, and intellectual strength. These quali-ties \u2014 the ones you demonstrate after you leave the campus \u2014 likewise contribute to raising the external perception of Northwestern. Y our commitment to sup-porting the College with your gifts has also contributedto our rise in national attention. In all of these ways, our alumni have helped Northwestern gain this increasedrecognition for educational excellence. So what does this mean for us now? As you know, ourapplicant pool has grown steadily stronger over the years,and the University is highly selective in terms of our students' academic and personal profiles. Our so-calledyield rate \u2014 the proportion of admitted students whochoose Northwestern \u2014 has risen as well. The combina-tion of selectivity and yield means that we can focusmore effectively on those high school juniors and seniorswho will do well in our rigorous curriculum and benefitfrom our many interdisciplinary initiatives. At the sametime, we are able to achieve our goal of cultivating a student body that is diverse intellectually, geographically,and ethnically, and diverse in their talents and goals. Indoing so, we continue together to create an atmospherethat year by year draws more of the nation's best facultyand students to the \"third coast\" on Lake Michigan. Eric Sundquist, Dean DCOURSE9222/WCAS/Crosscurrents 6.13 8/21/02 2:46 PM Page 12UNFORGETTABLE FACULTY In the fall Crosscurrents Dean Sundquist requested stories about teachers who made a lasting imprint on our lives. I was in the 1948 class of theCollege of Arts and Sciences. BERGEN EVANS brought literature to life; WILLIAM MCGOVERN, political science; and PAUL SCHILPP, philosophy (he was a communist). BILL BYRON made sociology electric for me. Monsieur ALPHONSE V. ROCHE was a great French teacher, a native speaker. The women's dean, RUTH MCCARN, helped me over some rough spots. I went through on scholarships that had to be earned by grade point average, notmerely need. When the men returned after World W ar II, we called them\"DARs\" (damned average-raisers). They made subjects such as economicsdifficult for the rest of us: They knew too much. I am proud of being aNorthwestern alumna. \u2014 Jean Norberg Eaglesong '48 LARRY WRIGHT was the English teacher who really shook me up as he challenged us students to question everything we had been brought up to automatically accept, whether it was r eligion, parental authority, morals, or whatever. We needed to do that if we were to mature and become independent thinkers, and the conclusions we were able to draw wereentirely up to us. . . . CLARK KEEBLER was my Greek professor. Not only did he make that ancient language sound like music, he taught us to trans-late into English the great philosophical ideas and literature that have been handed down from generation to generation. He was a great teacher for those who cherish language, words, and intellectual thinking. . . . Both of those wonderful teachers made an indelibleimpression on me and certainly influenced the rest of my life. \u2014 June Tarnopol Packer '41 In the late '70s and early '80s I spent several happyyears as a graduate student studying medieval poetry in Northwestern's French and Italian department. NORMAN SPECTOR insisted that we approach poetry from its simplest base: Each word had to be examined to its third level of meaning; each phoneme had to be consid- ered and then strung into words, phrases, lines, and verses. He taught usto relate sounds, meter, vocabulary, and images to the whole poem and to consider the normative values of the poet's time and culture. the mornings of R. BARRY FARRELL' s Soviet Policy class, a crowd would come early and fill every seat. A few minutes after the hour of class, R. Barry entered the big room inHarris Hall in a flurry. The flurry continued unabated throughout the hour, as R. Barrycaptivated the class with tales of his time with the highest reaches of the Politburo and atthe Kremlin. He made it seem like the entire Cold W ar could have ended years earlier, ifonly he and his good friend Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev could have sat down, smoked cigars,toasted each other with high-quality Russian vodka, and been left alone to make peace. R. Barry was well known on campus for his after-hours wine and cheeses with foreign dignitaries. On one occasion his guest du jour was Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, leader of the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coisseparatist movement. Labatt's was flowing freely, and R. Barry was feeling no pain. At justthe opportune moment, while R. Barry was discussing foreign policy with Ren\u00e9, I grabbeda Labatt's, stuck my head between the two foreign-policy dynamos, and with Mike Heeger,editor of Syllabus, at the ready, had my picture taken. R. Barry gave me a look that could have started World W ar III. The picture still adorns my wall 20 years later. For better or worse, R. Barry Farrell's whole life revolved around his students and his As an economics major at Northwestern I had the opportunity to listen to and learn from some of the great minds in economics: ROBERT EISNER, MARTIN EICHENBAUM, ROBERT J. GORDON, JONATHAN HUGHES, and others. The training I received has served me well in my career in investment banking. However, despite my capitalistic inclinations, I must admit that some of my most enjoyable and memorable classes at the University were with REBECCA BLANK (Theories of Income Distribution) and JAMES MONTGOMERY (Economics and the Social Sciences). These professors taught me \"compassionate economics\" \u2014 why Adam Smith's \"invisible hand\" or utility maximization didn't always work in reallife, that welfare for most wasn't a choice but a way of life. In truth, these are lessons I think I could have learned elsewhere . . . but isn't that something we can say for just about everything? The fact of thematter is, I learned it at Northwestern . . . and I am grateful to these people.\u2014 Albert Chung '92 poetry into its base components and then reassembling them led to a multilayered appreciation of what the poet had created. I have enjoyed poetry for many years, even sharing my delight with my three children, who grew up on tales of Roland, Beowulf, and Arthur. Norman Spector died several years after I left Northwestern, but his insight into how to read a poem continues to guide my reading. Merci mille fois, Professor Spector.\u2014 Shannon K. Hackett, French graduate student, 1979-81, and mother of Claire Adams '03 andJohn Patrick Adams '05 university. Testament to this fact is that when he died in 1991, he left virtually his entire estate to Northwestern to reward and promote undergraduate teaching in political science. \u2014 Jamie Rosenthal '81R. BARRY FARRELL9222/WCAS/Crosscurrents 6.13 8/21/02 2:46 PM Page 34Weinberg College produced a healthy list of major fellowship award winners again this year. \"With two Marshall scholarships, a George Mitchell scholarship the first year a Northwestern student has competed, and one winnereach for the Luce, Carnegie, and Truman awards, we're in a great groove now,\" says Sara Anson V aux, director ofNorthwestern's fellowships office. Her office has recently stepped up efforts to alert students to the awards and their requirements through a comprehensive handbook, a constantly updated Web site, and \"a critical nag factor\" to make sure students stay on top of deadlines. \"We are being aggressive,\" says V aux, \"and once we get students toapply, we know certain strategies to help them present themselves in the best light.\" BRITISH MARSHALL SCHOLARSHIP Two years of graduate study at any of nearly 100 universities in the United Kingdom Richard P.

Armed with a vision ofhow governments, businesses, andnongovernmental organizationscooperate to manage the global econ-omy, Johnson believes that the insti-tutions of government must bereformed to ensure that globalization leads to widespread prosperity. Hisvolunteer experience on a Sioux reservation in South Dakota helped focus his intellectual gifts on addressing economic injustice. In hispresent work with the CarnegieEndowment for International Peace,Johnson combines the theoretical and practical \u2014 both assessing globalization's impact on inequality and proposing innovative reforms tomake the international system moretransparent and accountable. He willuse his Marshall Scholarship tostudy at the London School ofEconomics and Political Science,taking him one step closer to his goalof formulating economic policywithin organizations like theInternational Monetary Fund andWorld Trade Organization. A former member of Northwestern's Jazz LabBand and Jazz Combos, Johnson is ajazz enthusiast who enjoys playingthe alto saxophone. Political science and music major Richard Caldarone '01 has been anexchange student to Japan in the Rotary International Program, served as speaker of the senate and in otherpositions in Northwestern's Student Government Association, and is amember of the Deru Senior HonorSociety and Pi Sigma Alpha PoliticalScience Honors Fraternity. He is anaccomplished musician and hasserved as musical director for localtheater productions in Chicago. Described by Northwestern's fellowships office as \"a resilient thinker who moves quickly and easily through a labyrinth of argu-ments,\" Caldarone has formidableknowledge on a range of topics. His interest in government and poli-tics, particularly citizen participationand apathy, will be the focus of hisstudies in philosophy, politics, andeconomics at Oxford University.

In an October 2000 ceremony in his office, Dean Eric J. Sundquist presented the students with their prizes and checks for $300. This year's Oliver Marcy Award recipients for achieve- ment in the natural sciences and mathematics were biologymajors Kirsten E. Nelson and Umasuthan Srikumaran andAnanth Raja Ram, a major in the Integrated Sciences Pro-gram and computing and information systems. Oliver Marcywas a professor of natural science at Northwestern from 1862 to 1899 and acting University president for six years. For the most distinguished junior-year record in the social sciences, the James Alton James Award was pre-sented to Laurie Eisengart, who is majoring in psychology;Michael J. Mueller, in economics and political science; andErica Sitkoff, in American studies. The award honors the former chair of the history department and the first dean of the Graduate School (1917-31). The 2000-01 Daniel Bonbright Award for outstanding students in the humanities was given to Neela E. Kale,majoring in religion and history; Victoria D. Nguyen, inHispanic studies and biology, and Samuel E. Tilsen, inEnglish and linguistics. Daniel Bonbright was professor ofLatin for 56 years and acting University president from 1900to 1902.

SUNDQUIST, ASSOCIATE DEAN ROBERT MICHAEL 2:46 PM Page 6Allergic reactions have skyrocketed in the past two decades. Northwestern's Ted Jardetzky (below, right, with postdoctoral fellow Scott Garman) does not know why, but his molecular images will help pharmacologists develop treatments for asthma and other allergies. He's not promising a cure, just new tools to help develop therapeutics for those who suffer from this growing health problem.Between 1980 and 1993 the death ratefrom asthma in the United States doubled, according to the Journal of the American Medical Association' s Asthma Information Center. There is no cure for asthma, which affects4.8 million children under 18. Untilrecently, doctors have prescribed anti- inflammatory agents and brocho-dilators, treating the symptoms, notthe cause. Antibody therapy, in con-trast, stops asthma attacks before theystart. Antibodies \u2014 specifically, theimmunoglobulin that triggers aller-gies \u2014 are what Jardetzky, an associateprofessor in the Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Cell Biology, is working on. Asthma attacks are triggered when allergens such as animal dander, dustmites, mold, food additives (sulfites),medication (penicillin), or pollen con-strict and inflame the airways of asth-matics. Similarly, hay fever sufferersendure a season of snif fles and itchy eyes. Chronic sinusitis, an inflamma- tion of the nasal passages due to aller-gic reactions, affects 35 million people each year. MOLECULAR IMAGES ADVANCE BREAKTHROUGHS IN ASTHMARESEARCHBY MARYLEE MACDONALD PHOTO COURTESY OF ARGONNE NATIONAL LABORATORY9222/WCAS/Crosscurrents 6.13 8/21/02 2:46 PM Page 78And, in 5 percent of the population, the allergic response is so severe andsudden, it is fatal. The human body fights off aller- gens the same way it fights off infec-tions: with antibodies. There are five kinds of antibodies \u2014 known technically as immunoglobulins \u2014 that act as the body's defensive line.Only one of these antibodies \u2014 theone that fights off parasites and caus-es allergic reactions \u2014 seems to beworking overtime. For decades researchers have studied the structure of the four other antibodies, includ-ing those that combat infection, butno one had come up with a good picture of the molecules involved inallergic reactions. Jardetzky set about trying to build a three-dimensional model ofthe molecular coupling that initiatesthe allergic response. The antibodiesand their receptors were tiny: 1,000times smaller than a cell. To make his model, Jardetzky needed to use X-rays to image the receptor \u2014 antibody complexes in a crystal \u2014 in order to figure out the details oftheir structures. Jardetzky and his team found their way through the maze. Magni-fying crystals of pure protein with the help of the synchrotron beam at Argonne National Laboratory, Jardetzky came up with the first three-dimensional images of this central interaction in the human allergic response, showing the recep-tor on the surface of mast cells (white blood cells) that are concentrated onthe skin, in nasal passages, and in thelining of the lungs. \"I've been waiting 15 years for this,\" said collaborator Jean-PierreKinet, professor of pathology at Harvard Medical School and directorof the Laboratory of Allergy andImmunology at Beth Israel DeaconessMedical Center. Kinet, who hadcloned the gene for the receptor 14years ago, was astonished. \"The crys- tals and the structures they show usare fantastic.\" The receptor had a hinged elbow at about the nine o'clock position. \"Other antibodies \u2014 the IgG anti- bodies that fight off bacterial andviral infections \u2014 are structurallysimilar to the receptor-bound IgEantibody. This arrangement of theantibody structure has been observedmany times over the past twodecades,\" said Jardetzky. \"But in theabsence of the receptor the immuno-globulin E structure was observed tochange to a shape never seen beforeon any other antibody.\" Now researchers can study the complete chain reaction of an allergicresponse from the moment the aller- gen prompts the immune system toproduce an antibody. They canobserve how the antibody (immuno- globulin, or IgE) binds to a receptor and how the antibody docks to the receptor in only one of its possible shapes. Once docking takes place, thecell can react to allergens to producehistamines and other substances thatcause the allergic reaction \u2014 wheez-ing in asthmatics, sneezing and itchyeyes in those allergic to pet dander, and conditions as severe as anaphy-lactic shock in people stung by bees. Antibody therapy of the type Jardetzky is helping to advance blocks the docking part of the IgE antibodyby using an \"anti\"-antibody. This is a bit like wrapping duct tape aroundthe notches of a key. Just as the thelock fails to recognize the key, the cellfails to produce an allergic reaction. This type of drug therapy has proveneffective in clinical trials, and patientsreceiving the monthly shot have seen their asthma attacks drop dramatically. There's just one hitch. The \"anti\"-antibody blocks allreactions, including some that may be beneficial.Jardetzky thinks that the site where the antibody hinges open might be a betterplace to intervene. Tinker with thelock, in other words, not the key. Jardetzky summed up his research this way: \"High-resolution images speed up the design of newdrug therapies. Pharmaceuticalchemists can go right to the mostpromising site, tweak it, and if thatdoesn't work, see the effect quickly,then go back to work. We have thetools to make medication a lot better in 5 to 10 years.\" JARDETZKY CAME UP WITH THE FIRST 3-D IMAGES OF THE HUMAN ALLERGIC RESPONSE. PHOTOS BY JEAN LACHAT. REPRINTED WITH PERMISSION9222/WCAS/Crosscurrents 6.13 8/21/02 2:46 PM Page 89MFA SSHAPING AT WEINBERG For a select few the answer is to return to school to earn a master's degree in fine art (MFA) through theprogram offered by Weinberg College's Department ofArt Theory and Practice. The department accepts a small number of graduate students each year, ensuring that each receives a highdegree of attention from faculty members who are cele-brated artists in their own right and devoted to helpingstudents in their creative growth. The department pro-vides several teaching fellowships each quarter to helpdefray the costs of graduate school and prepare artistsfor teaching positions in higher education. According to department chair Jeanne Dunning, \"It's exciting for artists to be at Northwestern becausethey're surrounded by people working at the top of somany different fields. That's a great opportunity as thevisual arts become more and more interdisciplinary.\" In the last few years the department has been sought out by more of the best and brightest artists working in a variety of media. Three recent MFA graduates werefeatured last fall in a Chicago Sun-Times article profil- ing the rising stars of Chicago's art scene. MOLLY BRIGGS: CELLULAR MAGIC While most Chicagoans get more than their fill of gray days, Molly Briggs (MFA '98) learned to appreciateovercast skies as a graduate student. \"My studio on the second floor of Kresge had huge, beautifully constructedwindows that went across the whole wall. On sunnydays there was almost too much light, but gray light wasperfect. I still love it,\" she says. The daughter of two painters, Briggs is well aware of the importance of light. Her own abstract paintings and prints explore degrees of translucence and a widerange of tones. Her most recent works depict vaguely cellular forms as if magnified, in both high-octane colorson Mylar and in round blue prints called photograms.\"Different colors absorb light to different degrees,\"Briggs explains. \"I like to look at how the paint impedes light, whether the color is purple or hot red or blue.\"THE PHRASE \"SUCCESSFUL ARTIST\" MAY NOT BE AN OXYMORON, BUT ITS USE IS RARE. WHAT CAN A STRUGGLING ARTIST DO TO ADVANCE HIS OR HER CAREER?MOLLY BRIGGS BY LISA STEINPHOTOS BY JEAN LACHAT. REPRINTED WITH PERMISSION FROM THE CHICAGO SUN-TIMES, INC., \u00a92001.9222/WCAS/Crosscurrents 6.13 8/21/02 2:46 PM Page 9Briggs studied painting and printmaking as an undergraduate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, earning her degree in 1991. A few years latershe moved to Chicago and, after surveying the city'sMFA programs, decided to apply to Northwestern. \"I knew a lot of artists who had gone to art schoolsdowntown, but I was impressed by what Northwesternoffered in terms of faculty and facilities.\" Although she considers herself first and foremost a painter, at Northwestern Briggs concentrated on print-making, wanting to take advantage of the University'sstate-of-the-art equipment and enhance her opportuni-ties for teaching. Her commitment paid off: After graduating she found teaching jobs first at ChicagoPrintmakers' Collaborative and, most recently, at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Briggs also has made big strides in her art career. In 1998 she received a grant from Northwestern's Centerfor Interdisciplinary Research in the Arts to complete a collaborative project with writer David Daskal. Called Habitat, the work joined Briggs's images inspired by scientific photography with Daskal's monologues ontopics such as Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and cyberspace. Habitat caught the eye of Ingrid Fassbender of Fassbender Gallery in Chicago, who staged a month-long exhibition of the work in 1999 and has representedBriggs ever since. Looking back on her years at Northwestern, Briggs recalls in particular the guidance of William Conger, Pamela Bannos, Judy Ledgerwood, James V alerio, and, most of all, Jeanne Dunning. \"Jeanne knew how to takein what students were doing and push them to a higherlevel of understanding. That's what I hope I can do withmy students.\" SUSAN GILES: VIDEO REVELATIONS Although many of her video works focus on people talking, Susan Giles (MFA '01) is just as interested inwhat her subjects don't say. Two of her most recent videos, for instance, show Giles herself in self-conscious pauses just before speak-ing. \"I've edited out everything except the spaces inbetween words,\" she explains. \"There's a lot of anxietyin those moments when you're about to say something.\" SUSAN GILES 109222/WCAS/Crosscurrents 6.13 8/21/02 2:46 PM Page 1011 Mother/Daughter, a video that was exhibited recently at V edanta Gallery in Chicago, expands on her theme of distorted communication. In the first halfof the video Giles speaks to the camera about herselfand her childhood \u2014 but from her mother's perspec-tive. Assuming a tone of maternal disapproval, Gilestells stories about her messy room when she was grow- ing up and her doubts about an artist's ability to earn a decent income. In the second half Giles's mother discusses herself from her daughter's point of view. In contrast to Giles's critical voice, her mother's takes on a kind of wide-eyed disbelief.Watching the video is as unnerving as rummaging through a stranger's closet. Even more revealing than their stories are the women's nonverbal clues \u2014 the shrugs, sighs, and glances they affect as they adopt each other's identities. \"The main reason I film myself and my family is that it adds another layer of meaning to the work,\" Giles says. \"The work is partly about how we define ourselves by what we say and how we are defined by what our friends and family say about us.\" Giles began working in video fairly recently. She earned her undergraduate degree in sculpture and\"I'VE EDITED OUT EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE SPACES IN BETWEEN WORDS ... THERE'S A LOT OF ANXIETY IN THOSE MOMENTS WHEN YOU'RE ABOUT TO SAYSOMETHING.\"\u2014 SUSAN GILES ANNA KUNZ9222/WCAS/Crosscurrents 6.13 8/21/02 2:46 PM Page 1112ceramics in 1992 from the University of Colorado and has used such offbeat materials as chipboard and spices. \"Butmy work is conceptually based, and I've found that video and photography are more conducive to my ideas.\" Giles accomplished a lot before gaining admission to Northwestern. She has taught art classes for elementary school children and developmentally disabled adults, andshe led a workshop at the Field Museum in Chicago. Shereceived a master's degree in art education in 1997 from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and soon afterwon a Fulbright scholarship to serve as artist in residence in a gallery in Bali for a year. When she returned home she decided to enroll in an MFA program. She chose Northwestern, she says, for its\"excellent, diverse faculty. Th ey've helped me think about my subject matter and encouraged my work in video. It's been great to have two years to really focus on making art.Now I'm ready to find a tenured teaching job.\" ANNA KUNZ: PAINTING AS PERFORMANCE Were it not for a wheeled cart, painter Anna Kunz (MFA '00) might still be pursuing a career in performance art. After receiving her undergraduate degree with a concentration in performance art from the School of theArt Institute of Chicago, she spent time creating theatri-cal monologues that dealt with the coming-of-age themesexplored by many young artists. But one day in her stu- dio Kunz decided to stage an experiment. She set up sev-eral small wooden panels around the room and wheeledherself across the floor from one to another on a platformthat her husband, artist Bryan Schuetze, had made for her. \"I would make a mark on one panel and move on toanother until I was spinning a web of images around the room,\" Kunz recalls. \"I was approaching painting as a performance, as an extension of a gesture.\" Pleased with the results of her experiment, Kunz poured her energy into painting. Viewers responded wellto her paintings, which were abstract works depicting natural shapes and geometric forms floating in fields ofsensuous color. Kunz says that it was important to herthat her paintings were aesthetically appealing \u2014 not acommon goal in much contemporary art. Before long, aChicago gallery began representing her, and her worksappeared in group shows around the city. After painting professionally for seven years, how- ever, Kunz felt she needed some feedback to continue her growth as an artist. \"It was a huge risk to go back toschool,\" she admits. \"My career as a painter was prettymuch in place at the time. But I wasn't really a part of theart community in Chicago, and I thought it would be agood thing to invite a critical perspective on my work.\" At Northwestern Kunz found the supportive com- munity she had been looking for. \"I learned somethingfrom everyone in the department. It was clear to me thatthey all really wanted to see students succeed in the artworld, and they always tried their best to answer our questions and challenge us.\" After finishing her MFA, Kunz resumed her success- ful career without a hitch. She will have an exhibition atthe Elmhurst Art Museum outside Chicago in July, andher last three solo exhibitions at the Thomas McCormickGallery in Chicago have sold out. \"Selling is not a bigmotivation for me, but it is a sort of validation,\" Kunzremarks. \"It's a big compliment when people choose to live around my work day in and day out.\"\"I WAS APPROACHING PAINTING AS A PERFORMANCE, AS AN EXTENSION OF A GESTURE.\"\u2014 ANNA KUNZ 9222/WCAS/Crosscurrents 6.13 8/21/02 2:46 PM Page 1213Discussing the problems of big-city public education in a college classroom is one way to learn about them; experi-encing them firsthand in the schools is another. Even better is getting the opportunity to devise plans to improvethings and to put those plans to work. Not every student intern sees the dramatic results Weinberg's Ryan Crosby (profiled later in this story) did in his field work with the Chicago public schools, butscores of Northwestern students each year are takingadvantage of their proximity to Chicago and enrolling ininternships with organizations as diverse as the ChicagoPublic Schools system, Amoco Foundation, the Chicago Cubs, Steppenwolf Theater, and Goldman Sachs. The pedagogical rationale for internships is that students bettergrasp the significance of their academic training by seeinghow ideas from the classroom work in real-world contexts;the practical reason is that graduate schools and employershave come to expect undergraduate-degree earners to comewith work experience under their mortarboards.SHARON BAUTISTA AND RHIANNON CARABAJAL: AN INSIDE LOOK AT MUSEUM LIFE Minority groups have been underrepresented in posi- tions of authority in the nation's museums. The National Museum Fellows Program, sponsored locally by the Chicago Historical Society and the Knight Foundation,hopes to begin to change that by demystifying what museums do and involving students in the engrossingwork that goes on behind the scenes. Rhiannon Carabajal '02 and Sharon Bautista '01, two of the Chicago Historical Society's first fellows, arefinding the 12-month program of study, apprenticeship, and travel both fascinating and fun. They also get paid \u2014 a $1,500 stipend and $4,500 for summer work/ study, plus academic credit. Carabajal, a junior from Santa Fe, New Mexico, and Bautista, a senior from Des Plaines, Illinois, belong to a small group of college students who have met once aweek since last fall with experts in museum work. They've STUDENT INTERNSMAKE THEIR MARK ON CHICAGO BY NANCY DENEEN9222/WCAS/Crosscurrents 6.13 8/21/02 2:46 PM Page 1314toured all the departments of the Chicago Historical Society and gained hands-on experience with every-thing from acquisitions and collections care to fund-raising and staging an exhibit. This summer they hope to produce something concrete, perhaps a portfolio or a CD-ROM, as evidence of what they have learned. Carabajal, who is double-majoring in political science and history, hopes to work in education-related public policy after she graduates. She says the mostintellectually stimulating part of her museum studieshas been learning how to create an exhibition that isclear and interesting without diluting the educationalcontent. \"Museums are first and foremost prime edu-cational institutions, but they also have a responsibil-ity to interpret and present educational material in aninteresting and interactive way,\" she says. For art history major Bautista, the biggest draw has been exhibition development. \"I wouldn't have said thatbefore the fellowship,\" she says. \"I've gotten a bettersense of what the public expects from museums. Thepublic's expectations are changing, and museum profes-sionals have to change the way they do their jobs. Theyhave to keep in touch with people's concerns and appealto publics that are broader than those of the past.\" On a more hands-on level, she's enjoyed her close con-tact with the Chicago Historical Society's renownedLincoln collection. \"I've been able to photograph thecloak that Mrs. Lincoln wo re the night the president was shot, and Lincoln's own comb and brush.\" A plus for Carabajal has been justifying her passion for history. \"I hear people say you can't really do any- thing with a history degree. My response to them is,'Well, I am doing something, and I'm having a fabulous time doing it.'\" RYAN CROSBY: MAGNETIC FORCE AT THE CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOLS How did a Northwestern junior with little relevant work experience become a vital force in shaping pro- grams for the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) during thecourse of a two-month internship? During his brief ini-tial stint in the offices of former schools CEO PaulVallas, Ryan Crosby '00 helped figure out how to bring enhanced learning opportunities to tens of thousands of students who would never get to step into one of thecity's 33 highly desirable magnet schools. For Crosby, V allas's first Northwestern intern, success stemmed from the convergence of timing andopportunity with skills and desire. Crosby credits LucyMillman, program assistant of the 20-year-old ChicagoField Studies Program at Northwestern, with making the connections that brought his name to the attentionof decision makers at CPS. \"I had a 10-minute interview,\" recalls Crosby, who double-majored in sociology and history. \"[CPS offi-cials] were really happy to see someone from a school like Northwestern. They definitely had a role for me.\" PREVIOUS PAGE: TIM LONG, CHICAGO HISTORICAL SOCIETY COLLECTIONS MANAGER, EXPLAINS THE FINER POINTS OF GOWNS FROM THE 1930S TO SHARON BAUTISTA (LEFT) AND RHIANNON CARABAJAL.

A believer inrunning an office with \"entrepreneurial spirit\" \u2014 beliefsthat Duncan says he shares with the school board andVallas himself \u2014 Duncan became Crosby's mentor. \"There was so much work going on that the opportu- nity to make a substantive c ontribution was there,\" says Duncan. \"Also Ryan was so good. He was uniquelyskilled and committed to seize the opportunity and runwith it. And hours were never an issue for him \u2014 he didfar beyond what an intern would be expected to do.\" When Crosby first entered the CPS offices in the old Edison building at Clark and Adams in spring 1999,Duncan was already at the drawing board fleshing out hisidea of magnet clusters. The problem to be solved wasthis: While the city's magnet schools were sought out bymany parents, they served only 8 percent of the system'sstudents. Magnet programs in hundreds of neighborhood elementary schools were uneven in quality and far less effective. It was Duncan's idea \u2014 an idea that Crosby'sresearch backed up \u2014 to organize neighborhood schools in clusters of four to six. Each school in the cluster woulddevelop excellence in one of four areas: math/ science, fineand performing arts, world language, or the InternationalCPS Scholars' Program, modeled on a Swiss program fordiplomats' children. Students, with guidance from parents,would then have a set of high-quality programs to choose from without having to leave their neighborhood. \"Rather than focusing on those 33 schools that every- one wants to get into, we wanted to show people that weare building up viable programs in the neighborhoodschools as well,\" said Crosby. Crosby conducted his own research on the programs that existed to show where resources were being usedeffectively and where they were not. \"Ryan is very brightand got up to speed on the issues in a very short time,\"said Duncan. \"He's thoughtful and analytical in his approach. He isn't shy about asking questions.\" Theresults of his work highlighted a lack of accountability for the additional funding schools had received and a cor- responding lack of achievement. The intern then helped map out a plan for structured and systematic change. The results? In the first year of the program, begin- ning in fall 2000, there were 20,000 applicants for clusterprograms in schools other than their own. \"Kids whonever had the chance before are learning world languages,\"said Duncan. \"They're in dance and drama; they're beingprepared for the rigorous International Baccalaureate pro-grams in high schools.\" As for Ryan Crosby, he now has afull-time job with the Chicago Public Schools. \"We'd hirelots more Northwestern grads if we could,\" said Duncan. RYAN CROSBY HELPED FIGURE OUT HOW TO BRING ENHANCEDLEARNING TO TENS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS.9222/WCAS/Crosscurrents 6.13 8/21/02 2:46 PM Page 1516JONATHAN KATZ: GIVING JELLY ROLL MORTON HIS DUE Not long ago jazz enthusiast Jonathan Katz '02 regarded Jelly Roll Morton as a relic of the jazz era of the '20s and '30s whose music seemed a bit staid: \"Like your grandfa-ther, he might have been cool once, but you just couldn'tsee it.\" Then a summer internship at the ChicagoHumanities Festival led Katz to a deeper understandingof the composer's innovations \u2014 \"he employed rhythmsand harmonies that are still new\" \u2014 and an increasedrespect for his role as a founder of the all-American art form. It led, in fact, to Katz's creating what may be the definitive Jelly Roll Morton Web site. The Humanities Festival brings respected artists and scholars to Chicago each November to take part inlectures, concerts, panel discussions, dramatic perform-ances, and film screenings organized around a theme ofuniversal interest. Each year Northwestern sends internsto the festival through the Alice Berline Kaplan Center for the Humanities. Last November's program included a section on the genius and influence of Jelly Roll Mortonthat was prompted by recent discoveries of remarkableMorton scores and an investigative report by Chicago Tribune writers Howard Reich and William Gaines on how the music industry cheated Morton out of fame androyalties. While working on some routine tasks like designing an invitation and writing press releases, Katzfound himself growing fascinated with Morton and pondering what project he could undertake to fulfill theinternship's requirements. \"I wasn't going to do groundbreaking research \u2014 Howard Reich and William Gaines had just done that,\"says Katz, a junior from Louisville, Kentucky. \"I found it was better to point people to information already out there. It didn't make sense to write a paper that's going toget put in a file and not help anyone. This is where theWeb comes in \u2014 it's a library to the world. Y ou need a navigating portal to get through all the material: Some of it's funny, some useless, some deceptively useful. Creatinga Web site was the one thing I could do to make any sort ofdifference.\" Working with Michael Kocour, a lecturer in the School of Music, Katz spent countless hours using searchengines to piece together the best of academic, commer-cial, and cultural Web material on Morton. Katz expresses pride in the site's lively graphic design and the narrative he wrote to thread Morton's storytogether: \"The site has a voice. It has cohesion and there's a story.\" He regrets not having the time to research andinclude sources other than those found on search engines. He hopes the site will help enhance Morton's reputa- tion. \"Louis Armstrong gets his due because he was sucha major figure on the world stage. Jelly Roll doesn'tbecause he came along before LP records were invented,\"Katz explained. \" A little of that is also not-so-latent racism. The white establishment saw him as a prototype of an African American entertainer, not a composer. . . .I'll be pleased if this site contributes to giving him hisdue.\" (Check out Katz's Web site at http:// pubweb.northwestern.edu/~jmk941/jellyroll). \"JELLY ROLL MORTON EMPLOYED RHYTHMS AND HARMONIES STILL NEW.\" \u2014 JONATHAN KATZ9222/WCAS/Crosscurrents 6.13 8/21/02 2:46 PM Page WHERE YOU WANT TO GO\" NICKOL ROBINSON '92, HISTORY Vice president, investment banking, Bear, Stearns & Company CURRENT OCCUPATION'S JOYS AND FRUSTRATIONS: In investment banking I have observed how rapidlybusiness models evolve in all industries. I am ofteninvolved early in the dialogue as management contem-plates the direction of the company and evaluates thecourse. I am able to help companies by identifying the appropriate capital solution and the right strategic part-ners. Often companies are reluctant to change despitethe competitive pace of their industry. In those situa-tions not even the most compelling ideas and businesseconomics can convince a company to embrace change.HOW NORTHWESTERN PREPARED ME: Northwestern offers a strong cross-disciplinary curricu- lum that emphasizes education rather than vocation. AtNorthwestern I was encouraged to challenge and dissect ideas and develop my own theses on a range of subjects.The scope of the curriculum, programming, and experi-ence played a tremendous role in shaping my analyticalframework and ability to tackle complexity. This hasbeen an important factor in my career as well as inpreparing me for graduate school. I have found thatmany experiences throughout my career have been anextension of my learning at Northwestern. MEMORIES THAT BRING A SMILE: I have many fond memories of Northwestern, particu-larly from my freshman year. I still miss munchies at the Plex, movie nights at Tech, and the featured protestof the week at the Rock. Dillo Day my freshman yearYOUNG WILSON MEMBERS: GIVING THANKS FOR THE DEGREE THAT CAMPAIGN NORTHWESTERN Whether it's the (until recently) healthy economy, an increase in the number of successful young entrepreneurs, or a simple case of loyalty to one's alma mater, university development officers say they're seeing more recent graduatesgive back to the schools that helped them succeed. There is even a course in creative philanthropy that teaches MBAstudents at a West Coast university to give responsibly. Even without a formal course in philanthropy, many youngWeinberg graduates have decided not to postpone charitable giving. Case in point: In fall 1999, the first year in which recent graduates were designated a separate category from others, 59 young alumni became members of the Wilson Society, contributing to the College's Alumni Fund. \"Like students working for programs such as Habitat for Humanity, young alumni want to contribute to worth- while causes,\" says Matthew TerMolen, Weinberg's director of development. In addition to the strong economy ofthe recent past, he mentions as influences on giving an appreciation for education and scholarship, opportunities fornetworking, and the desire to stay connected to Northwestern. Assistant director Jennifer Bryant says she hears thefollowing from young alums: They recognize the value of their degrees is enhanced as the University gains stature, so they view their gifts as investments in themselves as well as in the University. They simply feel a strong sense of loyalty to their alma mater and often to a specific professor, department, or program within Weinberg College. We've selected a random handful of young Wilson Society members and asked them to reflect on their careers, their time at Northwestern, and their philosophies of giving.9222/WCAS/Crosscurrents 6.13 8/21/02 2:46 PM Page 1718was the only Dillo Day with sunshine and good tempera- tures I can remember. My best memory was my senioryear when the rap group A Tribe Called Quest performed and hung out with us after the show at one of the partiesat the Shack. It nearly turned into a block party as it spilled outdoors. It really capped off a great four years.Many of my friendships from Northwestern remainstrong, and I am proud to witness the many accomplish-ments of my classmates. WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS: My long-term plan continues to evolve, being shaped by my collective experiences. I try to keep it flexible because the opportunities usually surpass my expectations. Ulti-mately, I plan to assume a principal position in my ownventure but look forward to many things along the way as well as setting a strong foundation for my family. ON GIVING: My Northwestern experience was very rich. I know that the generosity and involvement of others touched my lifeat Northwestern, enabling me to pursue my interests without limitation. I want to contribute to the quality of experience of students in the same way through giving, mentoring, recruiting, and programming to help otherstake advantage of all that Northwestern has to offer. JOHNMCCAREINS '98, PSYCHOLOGY Investment services account manager, The Northern Trust Company THE BEST AND WORST OF CAREER LIFE: What I love: the client contact and being in a position toadvise my clients on the appropriate course of action fortheir investment products. What I don't love: the clientcontact when the market isn't cooperating or technologi-cal difficulties halt all productive activities.HOW LIBERAL ARTS HELPED PAVE THE WAY: Although I didn't get the traditional financial backgroundfrom Northwestern, the well-rounded liberal arts educa-tion offered an opportunity to develop and apply peopleskills and problem-solving skills across varying situa-tions. That has helped in my current position because my perspective and appreciation for the bigger picture complement the perspectives of many of my colleagues,who tend to be more detail and analytically oriented.\" WHAT I REMEMBER FONDLY: Dorm life, complete with afternoon naps and no dishesto wash after meals. THE CRYSTAL BALL SAYS: I will be attending the Tuck School of Business atDartmouth this fall. Who knows from there? WHY THE WILSON SOCIETY? I've got fond memories of student life, and Northwesternhas done a lot for my career up to this point. Got to give alittle back from time to time. OMAR DAGHESTANI '96, ECONOMICS Graduate student at Harvard University, working toward a master's in public policy in June 2002 BACK TO SCHOOL: I'm working toward a degree in public policy with a focusin business and government. Being a student again hasbeen a significant change compared with working andwas a big shock during the first months. The academic grounding that I received from faculty like Mark Witte,Bob Coen, Lou Cain, Henry Binford, and others servedas excellent preparation for the program here, and Iappreciate it. DAGHESTANI JOHN MCCAREINS 2:46 PM Page 1819 \"THE GENEROSITY AND INVOLVEMENT OF OTHERS TOUCHED MY LIFE AT NORTHWESTERN . . . .\" \u2014 NICKOL ROBINSON ON THE DEGREE THAT TRAVELS WELL: As my career progressed at First USA, the world's largestcredit card bank, I found myself pushed outside the comfort zone in taking on responsibilities in areas likemarketing strategy, compensation policy, and operationsmanagement. Northwestern really helped me meet thosechallenges, giving me the ability to think critically and towork well with others. Northwestern credentials and experience take people wherever they want to go. WHAT I NEVER THOUGHT I'D LIKE AT NORTHWESTERN: Much as I embraced talk of the new global economy, I had no interest in taking a foreign language at North-western, considering that I was lucky to squeak through two years of high school French. Convinced that I mightbe able to circumvent the requirement, I went to talkwith Dean [Richard] Weimer, and he assured me that Ididn't have to take a foreign language \u2014 unless I wantedmy degree to say \"Northwestern\" on it. He advised me to take German with Denise Meuser, which I did. Studying with her and the German department faculty ended up as the best academic experience I had at North-western and one that I wouldn't trade for anything. WHAT'S NEXT: This summer I am looking forward to an internship with Booz, Allen & Hamilton in their New Y ork finan-cial services strategy practice. More long-term, it's harderto say, but I think that more of my work will take me abroad, and I look forward to that challenge. ON GIVING BACK TO NORTHWESTERN: It seemed like the right thing to do, and I am glad I did it. 9222/WCAS/Crosscurrents 6.13 8/21/02 2:47 PM Page 1920The moon bears of Southeast Asia \u2014 large coal-colored creatures with white crescent-shaped fur on their chests(thus their name) and lion-like manes \u2014 are the most primitive of bears. They retain, for example, short, curvedclaws for tree climbing, unlike the long, relatively straightclaws of the grizzly, which are specialized for digging. Inrecent years they have lost much of their natural habitat and have become easy prey for poachers. The bears' dramatically dwindling numbers have made them anendangered species. But the bears have a champion in Gary Galbreath, college lecturer in biological sciences at Northwestern.Galbreath travels twice a year to remote places in Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia with the twofold goal oflearning more about the bears and helping governmentofficials return them to their natural environment. Wildlife workers are able to rescue hundreds of bears; Galbreath then uses mitochondrial DNA analysis tomatch hair samples of bears in captivity to those of bearsin the wild in order to locate the captive bears' originalhomes. We spoke with Galbreath about his work \u2014 both its impact on the bears' welfare and its broader scientificimplications, such as the mapping of bear migrations thattook place thousands of years ago. HOW DID YOU GET INVOLVED IN BEAR CONSERVATION IN SOUTHEAST ASIA? I was in China in the late 1980s and thought I saw a unique bear \u2014 like a moon bear but with totally differentcoloring. I was unable to find more information at thetime, but 10 years later I learned of a similarly coloredbear in Cambodia, and the deputy director of that country's wildlife program arranged for me to visit.Everything followed from that. Although the animal turned out not to be a new species, I learned a lot aboutconservation efforts, took many DNA samples of moonbears, and have been involved ever since. I work with Sy Montgomery, a science journalist and author of Walking with the Great Apes: Jane Goodall, Dian Fossey, Birute Galdikas. AS AN EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGIST, WHAT IS YOUR BROADER SCIENTIFIC INTEREST IN RESCUING MOON BEARS? I study mainly mammals: their adaptations, relation- ships, and paleontology. I hope eventually to combineknowledge of moon bear migrations derived from DNAstudies with the fossil record of moon bears. One of theneatest aspects of this sort of mitochondrial DNA work is that data collected from living animals in a single snap-shot of time (the present) can be used to reconstructevents such as the crossing of river or mountain barriers, GARY GALBREATH'S MOON B GARY GALBREATH (FAR RIGHT) WITH GUIDES AND WILDLIFE OFFICIALS IN CAMBODIA9222/WCAS/Crosscurrents 6.13 8/21/02 2:47 PM Page 2021long-distance migrations, the severing of gene exchange between populations, etc., that took place thousands ofyears ago. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE A TYPICAL DAY IN THE FIELD? It all depends on the country. Last time in Laos we trav- eled by four-wheel drive to remote villages, where weasked people if they knew of any bears in captivity or inthe wild. But while Laos means bumping along muddyroads, Thailand means zipping along modern highways. You can hire a driver and a Mercedes and cover much of the country for less cost than a cab ride from Evanston to O'Hare. Much of my work in Thailand entails takinghair samples of bears that have been rescued by the ThaiRoyal Forest Department and whose care is overseen by the Thai Society for the Conservation of Wild Animals,both very active and effective groups. Traveling inCambodia can be very tricky. One day I was a passengeron a motorcycle going over rough logging roads; we hitrocks and tree stumps and fell off three times. The next day I was walking like a robot. I don't want to repeat that. WHAT IS THE HARDEST PART OF YOUR WORK? Seeing the environmental destruction and how few animals are left. There are an awful lot of \"empty forests\"where you can walk for a long time and not ever hear abird sing.DO MOON BEARS BELONG IN ZOOS IN DEVELOPED NATIONS? While Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos are overflowingwith rescued moon bears \u2014 some government workersare even keeping them in their backyards \u2014 Western zoosare not very interested in them. Zoo officials are afraid ofbeing accused of taking bears out of the wild. The storyI'm trying to get out is that many of the bears are alreadyin captivity and will die if zoos don't take some of them.Zoos could promote conservation of the species by pursu-ing captive breeding programs with animals sent fromSoutheast Asia. WILL RESCUED BEARS BE RETURNED TO THE WILD? We're hoping some of the bears will be released this year, first into a seminatural habitat with fences, so they can get used to acquiring food naturally. Since most of themwere rescued as cubs, some are too tame to be released, and the rest have almost no experience in the wild.They'll be radio-monitored to make sure they keep awayfrom villages. WHAT ARE THE CHIEF REWARDS OF YOUR WORK? The best scientific result is the wonderful data we've col-lected on the migrations of the moon bear over the lastmillion years. The work we do also has a real conserva-tion aspect. If we can correlate genetic variation withmorphological variation, we may be able to define distinct subspecies within the moon bear species Ursus thibetanus . Once the subspecies are identified and named, the animal becomes the subject of conservationwork, and then its chances of survival greatly increase. Moon bears are going fast: Less than 1 percent of thenumber that existed in the wild 50 years ago still remain. We are also saving many individual bears we find in captivity, moving them to better facilities where theywon't starve. As an animal lover, I am very pleased. N BEAR MISSION \"MOON BEARS ARE GOING FAST. LESS THAN 1 PERCENT OF THE NUMBER THAT EXISTED IN THE WILD 50 YEARS AGO STILL REMAIN.\" BY NANCY DENEEN9222/WCAS/Crosscurrents 6.13 8/21/02 2:47 PM Page 2122When \u2014 too many years ago to mention \u2014 I was a newly appointed department chair at the University of Pennsylvania, and filled over the brim with things I wanted to accomplish, I was fortunate to have a colleague in the econom ics department who had once served on the Soviet Union's top planning unit. Once Aron posed a question to a group of faculty: Nature, he began, has designed fabulously complex structures \u2014 think of the eye or the liver. It can engineerthings far beyond human capacity. Why, then, has it never designed an animal that moves withwheels? As we all pictured a wheeled cheetah accelerating towards a turbo-rhinoceros, and con-jured an arms race of gears between predator and prey, Aron explained why wheels would notcontribute to survival after all: \"Because the world isn't paved.\" If things were smooth like I-94, wheels would be an advantage. They are highly specialized and in the appropriate conditions are far better than legs. Who would walk from here to San Francisco? But what if there is a fallen tree inyour way? What about the hundred thousand obstacles, from a ditch to a stone, that one cannot predict? In an uneven world, a world of radical uncertainty, legs and flexibility are better than wheels and specialization. Aron's parable teaches us something fundamental about life: Do not expect the orderly, the familiar, or the symmetrical. Think of how we are made: Our hands have a built-in tremble, or we would not need tripods; our eyes scan without our willing it; we are always shifting our position and find it hard to focus our attention. It's as if our bodies and ourminds were continually attuned to perceiving the unexpected before it is too late. Everywhere, the world is telling us not to be too sure of ourselves, not to take our sometimes helpful oversimplifi- cations for fact. Y ou know the old story about the social scientist who begins a talk: \"Now, assume a square cow.\" How many right angles have you seen in living creatures? How many with a single color or regular geometric shape? I confess to having a soft spot for the gourd, the walrus, and the ostrich. And how many social institutions are not rifeBY GARY SAUL MORSONSPARE,STRANGEORIGINAL ,COUNTER, GARY SAUL MORSON IS FRANCES HOOPER PROFESSOR OF SLAVIC LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES.

Anyone who expects an institution or a reform to acco mplish its supposed purpose without constant tinkering is in for a surprise. No one can guess the consequences of conse-quences of consequences. These observations have a moral \u2014 in fact, more than one: Keep in mind that what you most believe may prove false, and, whenever possible, act as ifflexibility and self-skepticism are virtues: because they are. If there is a point to the novels of Jane Austen, it is that our pride and prejudice, our habits of 9222/WCAS/Crosscurrents 6.13 8/21/02 2:47 PM Page 22R THAN WHEELS AND SPECIALIZATION.\" perception, and our egotistic desire not to see what might prove us wrong lead us to constant mistakes. And that is especially so if the people we most like all think the same way. Knowing a lot is not the same as thinking, and, when you forget all your Spanish grammar and chemical formulae, I hope you remember this: If, in examining a social or moral problem, it appears to you that people on the other side must be either ill-intentioned or stupid, then you aren't thinking. A few weeks ago I attended a ceremony in which a prominent sociologist here, Professor NicolaBeisel, described how, though a committed feminist, she found herself working one-on-one with a pro-life Catholic, and how she learned to see the world and the issue in question better precisely byencountering someone intelligent and well-intentioned who disagreed with her. That is what thinkingis about. Take your favorite issue: If you can't imagine how a decent person with different experiences from yours could be on the other side, then see that lack of imagination as your own deficiency and find out. If you're a liberal, make a point of reading The Wall Street Journal and Commentary frequently, and if you are a conservative, at least The New York Times and The New Republic. Keep in mind the following golden rule: There are the same proportion of swine to decent people on your side of the issue as on the other. And so imagine not only how an opponent might have motives as good as yours, but also how someone on your side might be entirely self-interested. Every issue has its tobacco companies, on both sides. And if the reform is passed, those are the people who will control how it is administered \u2014 after all, with theirinterests at stake, they will persist long after the idealists. Democracy depends on a strong appreciation of opinion. Do not imagine that we are in a battle of good and evil, right and wrong, whichfor some historical reason is determined by elections. In that case, you don't really believe in democracy and would not be troubled by simplybeing able to impose your point of view. No, recall that the world is notpaved, that many times in the past the most intelligent and well-intentioned people on your side have been eventually proven wrong. Think of all those people who became communists for the good of humanity, and the tens of millions of corpses they wound up apologizing for. In Tolstoy's War and Peace, the hero realizes what is wrong with a man he has idolized: It had never crossed that man's mind that allhe believed might be utter nonsense. The reason to know different cultures is the same as the reason to read realist novels: They allow us to see theworld through a different set of eyes. Once one can see a set of values from the perspective of a different culture, andunderstand how we look to them, how they notice thingsthat aren't even an issue among us, we can no longer think 239222/WCAS/Crosscurrents 6.13 8/21/02 2:47 PM Page 2324\"IF THINGS WERE SMOOTH, WHEELS WOULD BE AN ADVANTAGE.\" that the way we divide up the world is the only reasonable one. It's like stereoscopic vision: Just as we can only judge distance because we have two eyes, so knowing two cultures helps us to see things we otherwise couldn't. So here's a plea: Those of you who are fortunate to speak a language other than English at home, do your best to keepand improve it. It's not just another language, but also another set of eyes. And let me also make a plea for the great realist novels. Their main premise is that it is possible to get inside the mind and feelings of a person very much unlike yourself \u2014 someone from another class, of the opposite sex, of adifferent personality complex and different era. No one could be more unlike me than the upper-class beautiful heroine of Edith Wharton's House of Mirth, but I grew so to identify with her that her death brought me to tears. Once you have had that experience, you see other people differently. And yourself, as well. God willing, you will change your mind many times in your life. The only way not to is to shut out inconven- ient evidence. The world does not go according to plan. If it did, we wouldn't need insurance. The world is notsmooth or monochromatic; no, it is motley, dappled, patchy \u2014 pied, like the clothes of the pied piper. And if you don't want to be like the children the pied piper led to destruction, never think a single song has all beauty. Creativity happens when one loves an activity, a process, and is totally immersed in it, so that one wants to play with all the possibilities and invent new ones. The same is true with knowledge in general: One needs to know a lotto know reasonably specifically the next thing one wants to know. The more one knows and wants to know, the more this circle of informed ignorance expands. At least, that is true if one loves the very process of learning, which, more than any specific knowledge, is what I hope Northwestern helped you foster. Students often come to me to talk about what occupation to take up when they graduate. To my great pleasure, they often mention choosing work that is meaningful, with idealistic goals,which demonstrates their good character \u2014 but also their yo uth. The problem is, that if one chooses an occupation with goals one values but day-to-day work one does not like, one will not advance even the goals. Take it from anold professor: Choose an occupation where you love the process of day-to-day work, what you are doing when youare not even thinking of the goals. Love the work itself! Life is not smooth, but that is a good thing. It is an endless source of wonder. Think of all those odd shapes you will see: A trip to a hardware store, no less than a field set off in odd-shaped plots, or the asymmetrical markings ona fish can be a source of wonder. Oh, maintain your sense of wonder! I would like to close by reciting my favorite short poem in English, \"Pied Beauty,\" by Gerard Manley Hopkins: Glory be to God for dappled things. For skies of couple-colour as a brinded cow.

In fact, their entire frame of reference \u2014 at least insofar as technology, politics, history, and entertainment are concerned \u2014 radically differs from that of their parents and many of their teachers. Then we came across a list entitled \"Mindset of First-Y ear Students\" from Beloit College. We've borrowed from that list (items marked *) and come up with some observations of our own about the world \u2014 the United States in particular \u2014 inhabited by the incoming freshman class, most of whom were born in 1983.
