Rice, MD2; Carlos G. Grijalva, IVY Network; HAIVEN Investigators On April 28, 2021, this report was posted as an MMWR Early Release on the MMWR website (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr). Adults aged 65 years are at increased risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19 and were identified as a priority group to receive the first COVID-19 vaccines approved for use under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the United States (1-3). In an evaluation at 24 hospitals in 14 states,* the effec- tiveness of partial or full vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines against COVID-19-associated hospitalization was assessed among adults aged 65 years. Among 417 hospi - talized adults aged 65 years (including 187 case-patients and 230 controls), the median age was 73 years, 48% were female, 73% were non-Hispanic White, 17% were non-Hispanic Black, 6% were Hispanic, and 4% lived in a long-term care facility. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19-associ - ated hospitalization among adults aged 65 years was estimated to be 94% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 49%-99%) for full vaccination and 64% (95% CI = 28%-82%) for partial vac - cination. These findings are consistent with efficacy determined from clinical trials in the subgroup of adults aged 65 years (4,5). This multisite U.S. evaluation under real-world condi - tions suggests that vaccination provided protection against COVID-19-associated hospitalization among adults aged * P atients were enrolled from 24 medical centers in 14 states (University of California Los Angeles and Stanford University [California], UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital [Colorado], Johns Hopkins Hospital [Maryland], Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Baystate Medical Center [Massachusetts], University of Michigan, Henry Ford, and St. Joseph [Michigan], Hennepin County Medical Center [Minnesota], Montefiore Healthcare Center [New Wake Forest University [North Carolina], Ohio State University [Ohio], Oregon Health & Science University [Oregon], University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Shadyside, Mercy, Passavant, St. Margaret, and Presbyterian Hospitals [Pennsylvania], Vanderbilt University Medical Center [Tennessee], Baylor Scott & White Medical Center, Temple, Round Rock, Hillcrest/Waco [Texas], and Intermountain Health [Utah]). P artially vaccinated is defined as receipt of 1 dose of a 2-dose vaccine series (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines) 14 days before illness onset or 2 doses with the second dose received <14 days before illness onset. Fully vaccinated is defined as receipt of both doses of a 2-dose vaccine series, with the second dose received 14 days before illness onset.65 years. Vaccination is a critical tool for reducing severe COVID-19 in groups at high risk. Randomized clinical trials of vaccines that have received an EUA in the United States showed efficacy of 94%-95% in preventing COVID-19-associated illness ( 4,5). \u00a7 However, hospitalization is a rare outcome among patients with COVID-19-associated illness of any severity, so most cases detected in the trials did not lead to hospitalization; there - fore, the studies had limited power to assess protection against severe COVID-19 among older adults. Postmarketing observational studies are important to assess VE against COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in adults aged 65 years under real-world conditions and to strengthen evidence from clinical trials of vaccine efficacy. A standard approach to post- marketing VE evaluation involves the test-negative design in which vaccine performance is assessed by comparing the odds of antecedent vaccination among case-patients with acute laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and control-patients without acute COVID-19 (6). During January 1, 2021-March 26, 2021, adults with COVID-19-like illness \u00b6 admitted to 24 hospitals in 14 states within two networks (the Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network [HAIVEN] and the Influenza and Other Viruses in the Acutely Ill [IVY] Network) were enrolled. \u00a7 Pfiz er-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are approved for use under an EUA in the United States. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is used to detect possible signals of adverse events associated with vaccines. Adverse events related to these COVID-19 vaccines can be reported at https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/report-problem-center- biologics-evaluation-research/vaccine-adverse-events or https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html. \u00b6 IVY N etwork criteria for COVID-19-like illness included presence of fever, feverishness, cough, sore throat, myalgias, shortness of breath, chest pain, loss of taste, loss of smell, respiratory congestion, increased sputum production, new oxygen saturation <94% on room air, new requirement for invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation, or new pulmonary findings on chest imaging consistent with pneumonia. HAIVEN criteria included fever without a known non-COVID-19 cause, new or worsening cough, a change in sputum production, or new or worsening shortness of breath.Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / May 7, 2021 / V ol. 70 / No. 18 675 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionSummary What is already known about this topic? Clinical trials suggest high efficacy for COVID-19 vaccines, but evaluation of vaccine effectiveness against severe outcomes in real-world settings and in populations at high risk, including older adults, is needed. What is added by this report? In a multistate network of U.S. hospitals during January-March 2021, receipt of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines was 94% effective against COVID-19 hospitalization among fully vaccinated adults and 64% effective among partially vaccinated adults aged 65 years. What are the implications for public health practice? SARS-CoV-2 vaccines significantly reduce the risk for COVID-19-associated hospitalization in older adults and, in turn, might lead to commensurate reductions in post-COVID conditions and deaths. Patients were eligible if they were aged 65 years on the date of hospital admission, received clinical testing for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) by reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or antigen test within 10 days of illness onset, and had onset of symptoms 0-14 days before admission. Case-patients were those who received one or more positive test results for SARS-CoV-2. Patients meeting eligibility criteria who received negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results served as controls. Baseline demographic and health information, details about the current illness, and SARS-CoV-2 testing history were obtained by patient or proxy interviews with trained study personnel and electronic medical record review. Patients or proxies were asked about SARS-CoV-2 vaccination history including number of doses, dates and loca - tion of vaccination, and availability of vaccination record cards documenting receipt. Secondary electronic medical records and state immunization registry searches for SARS-CoV-2 vaccina - tion records were conducted during March 26, 2021-April 19, 2021, for all included patients without vaccination record cards to verify reported or unknown vaccination status. Participants were considered to have received COVID-19 vac - cine doses based on documentation by CDC vaccination record card, state immunization registry search, electronic medical record search, or by plausible self-report if they provided vac - cination dates and location. Documented record of vaccination dates was used when any potential discordance was identified between self-reported and documented dates. Participants with unverified COVID-19 testing status or vaccination status, or vac - cination with Janssen COVID-19 vaccine (Johnson & Johnson), which was in limited use during the evaluation period, were not included. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination status included four catego - ries: 1) unvaccinated, defined as no receipt of any SARS CoV-2 vaccine before illness onset; 2) single-dose vaccinated <14 days before illness, defined as receipt of the first vaccine dose <14 days before COVID-19-like illness onset; 3) partially vaccinated, defined as receipt of 1 dose of a 2-dose vaccination series (Pfizer- BioNTech or Moderna vaccines) 14 days before illness onset or 2 doses, with the second dose received <14 days before illness onset** (7 ); and 4) fully vaccinated, defined as receipt of both doses of a 2-dose vaccine series, with the second dose received 14 days before illness onset. Estimates of VE were calculated by comparing the odds of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in case-patients and controls using the equation VE = 100% \u00d7 (1 odds ratio), determined from logistic regression models ( 8). The 95% CIs were calculated as 1 CI OR, where CI OR is the confidence inter - val of the odds ratio estimates. Models were adjusted a priori for suspected confounders, including U.S. Census region, calendar month, age (as a continuous variable), sex, and race/ethnicity. Other factors were included in the model if they changed the adjusted odds ratio of vaccination by >5%. Primary VE estimates were stratified by partial versus full vaccination. VE for patients reporting illness onset <14 days after receipt of the first dose of a 2-dose vaccine was also assessed. Because protective immunity is unlikely to be achieved immediately after vaccination ( 4,5,7), absence of VE within 14 days of the first dose was used as a proxy indicator of absence of bias in the primary VE estimates (6). Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute). This activity was reviewed by CDC and the other participating institutions and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy. During January 1-March 26, 2021, 489 patients were eli - gible for participation, 72 (15%) of whom were excluded for the following reasons: 30 had SARS-CoV-2 testing >10 days after illness onset, 19 were hospitalized >14 days after illness onset, eight had onset of COVID-19-like illness after admis - sion, three received the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, and 12 had incomplete vaccination verification. Among the 417 patients included in the final analysis (including 187 case-patients and 230 controls), median age was 73 years for case-patients and controls, 48% were female, 17% were non-Hispanic Black, 6% were Hispanic (any race), 48% had one or more earlier hos - pitalizations in the last year, and 4% lived in a long-term care facility before admission (Table). Among the 187 case-patients, 19 (10%) had received at least 1 dose of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine 14 days before illness onset (includ - ing 18 [10%] who were partially vaccinated and one [0.5%] who was fully vaccinated) compared with 62 (27%) of 230 test-negative controls (including 44 [19%] and 18 [8%] who were partially and fully vaccinated, respectively).

HAIVEN criteria included fever without a known non-COVID-19 cause, new or worsening cough, a change in sputum production, or new or worsening shortness of breath. SARS -CoV-2 vaccination status included the following four categories: 1) unvaccinated, defined as no receipt of any SARS CoV-2 vaccine; 2) single-dose vaccinated <2 weeks before illness onset, defined as receipt of the first vaccine dose within 14 days before onset of COVID-like illness; 3) partially vaccinated, defined as receipt of 1 dose of a 2-dose vaccine series (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) 14 days before illness onset or receipt of 2 doses, with the second dose received <14 days before illness onset; 4) fully vaccinated, defined as receipt of both doses of a 2-dose vaccine series, with the second dose received 14 days before illness onset. \u00a7 P atients were enrolled from 24 medical centers in 14 states (University of California Los Angeles and Stanford University [California], UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital [Colorado], Johns Hopkins Hospital [Maryland], Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Baystate Medical Center [Massachusetts], University of Michigan, Henry Ford, and St. Joseph [Michigan], Hennepin County Medical Center [Minnesota], Montefiore Healthcare Center [New Wake Forest University [North Carolina], Ohio State University [Ohio], Oregon Health & Science University [Oregon], University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Shadyside, Mercy, Passavant, St. Margaret, and Presbyterian Hospitals [Pennsylvania], Vanderbilt University Medical Center [Tennessee], Baylor Scott & White Medical Center, Temple, Round Rock, Hillcrest/Waco [Texas], and Intermountain Health [Utah]). \u00b6 Northeast: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont; Midwest: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin; South: Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia; West: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. ** I nformation was obtained by patient or proxy self-report.Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / May 7, 2021 / V ol. 70 / No. 18 677 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionof receipt of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines was similar (53% and 47%, respectively, among those vac - cinated with 1 doses).

Clinical cr iteria for hospitalized COVID-19-like illness varied by hospital network. IVY Network criteria for COVID-19-like illness included presence of fever, feverishness, cough, sore throat, myalgias, shortness of breath, chest pain, loss of taste, loss of smell, respiratory congestion, increased sputum production, new oxygen saturation <94% on room air, new invasive or noninvasive ventilation, or new pulmonary findings on chest imaging consistent with pneumonia in the IVY Network; criteria included fever without a known non-COVID-19 cause, new or worsening cough, a change in sputum production, or new or worsening shortness of breath in the HAIVEN network. \u00a7 SARS -CoV-2 vaccination status included the following four categories: 1) unvaccinated, defined as no receipt of any SARS CoV-2 vaccine; 2) first vaccine dose <14 days before illness onset, defined as a single dose of vaccine within 14 days prior to onset of COVID-19-like illness; 3) partially vaccinated, defined as receipt of 1 dose of a 2-dose vaccine series (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) 14 days before illness onset or 2 doses with the second dose received <14 days before illness onset); 4) fully vaccinated, defined as receipt of both doses of a 2-dose vaccine series 14 days before illness onset. \u00b6 P atients were enrolled from 24 medical centers in 14 states (University of California Los Angeles and Stanford University [California], UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital [Colorado], Johns Hopkins Hospital [Maryland], Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Baystate Medical Center [Massachusetts], University of Michigan, Henry Ford, and St. Joseph [Michigan], Hennepin County Medical Center [Minnesota], Montefiore Healthcare Center [New Wake Forest University [North Carolina], Ohio State University [Ohio], Oregon Health & Science University [Oregon], University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Shadyside, Mercy, Passavant, St. Margaret, and Presbyterian Hospitals [Pennsylvania], Vanderbilt University Medical Center [Tennessee], Baylor Scott & White Medical Center, Temple, Round Rock, Hillcrest/Waco [Texas], and Intermountain Health [Utah]).Discussion Monitoring the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination under routine public health use and specifically against severe outcomes in patients at higher risk, including older adults, is a high priority. In this multistate analysis of adults aged 65 years, receipt of an authorized COVID-19 vaccine was associated with significant protection against COVID-19 hospitalization. Effectiveness was 94% among adults who were fully vaccinated and 64% among adults who were partially vaccinated (i.e., onset of COVID-like illness 14 days after the first vaccine dose in a 2-dose series but <14 days after the second dose). These findings are consistent with efficacy determined from clinical trials in the subgroup of adults aged 65 years ( 4,5). Early reports from Israel have also documented the real-world effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, including among older adults (7,9). However, those postmarketing reports only represented the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. In the current report, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccine products were equally represented, and approximately one half of the patients were aged 75 years, providing evidence of real-world effective - ness of both vaccines against an important measure of severe COVID-19 in older adults. Moreover, in assessing the impact of receiving only a single dose, no significant vaccine effective - ness <14 days after the first dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was detected. This suggests that bias is unlikely in the primary estimates of vaccine effectiveness from partial and full vaccina - tion. This also highlights the continued risk for severe illness shortly after vaccination, before a protective immune response has been achieved and reinforces the need for vaccinated adults to continue physical distancing and prevention behaviors, such as use of face masks and recommended hand hygiene at least 14 days after the second dose of a 2-dose vaccine. The find - ings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines can reduce the risk for COVID-19-associated hospitalization and, as a consequence of preventing severe COVID-19, vaccination might have an impact on post-COVID conditions (e.g., \"long COVID\") and deaths (2,10). The findings in this report are subject to at least six limita - tions. First, the CIs for VE estimates were wide because of the small sample size, and the number of participants was too small to assess VE by vaccine product, age group, or underly - ing conditions. Second, as an interim analysis that included self-reported data, vaccination status might have been misclas- sified, or participants might have had imperfect recollection of vaccination or illness onset dates. Third, selection bias and residual confounding cannot be excluded. Fourth, although the analysis included hospitalized adults from 14 states, the participants were not geographically representative of the U.S. population. Fifth, the case-control design infers protection based on associations between disease outcome and previous Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 678 MMWR / May 7, 2021 / V ol. 70 / No. 18 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionvaccination but cannot establish causation. Finally, duration of VE and VE for nonhospitalized COVID-19 was not assessed. During January-March 2021, in a multistate network of U.S. hospitals, vaccination was associated with a reduced risk for COVID-19-associated hospitalization among adults aged 65 years. These data suggest that continuing to rapidly vaccinate U.S. adults against COVID-19 will likely have a marked impact on COVID-19 hospitalization and might lead to commensurate reductions in post-COVID conditions and deaths (2,10).
