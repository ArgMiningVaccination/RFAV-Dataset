[Monoclonal antibodies](https://www.coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org/monoclonal-antibodies/) are medicines that directly deliver man-made antibodies against a virus to your body to help fight off infection. To treat Covid-19, the FDA has approved two monoclonal antibody treatments for emergency use -- [bamlanivimab](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-monoclonal-antibody-treatment-covid-19) and the [casirivimab and imdevimab](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-monoclonal-antibodies-treatment-covid-19) antibody cocktail. These treatments are given to patients through an IV and attack the natural [spike protein](https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/explainer-what-is-a-spike-protein) found on the surface of the Covid-19 virus. The antibodies typically only last a few months. Whether monoclonal antibodies can be used to prevent infection is also being studied. However, protection from a monoclonal antibody is not likely to last as long as protection from a vaccine. Vaccines work differently. They prompt your immune system to \"learn\" about the virus and build longer-lasting defenses against it. That includes the production of natural antibodies.
