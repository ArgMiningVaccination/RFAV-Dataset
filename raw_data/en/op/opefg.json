Acupuncture, Feng Shui, Chinese Herbal Medicine and Qigong all have the same principles of balancing out the 5 Elements (water, wood, fire, earth, metal) within the body. Acupuncture specifically uses meridian points related to each of the organs, and places small needles on those points to create more Qi (chi/energy) flow in the body. Disease and pain can always be traced back to a certain imbalanced element, or elements, in the body. The Water element is represented in the Kidney, Bladder, the Ears and Bone. It is related to the emotion of fear. The Wood element is represented in the Liver, Gall Bladder, Eyes and Tendons. It is related to the emotion of angry. The Fire element is represented in the Heart, Small Intestine, Tongue and Blood Vessels. It is related to the emotion of panic/anxiety. The Earth element is represented in the Stomach, Spleen, Mouth and Muscles. It is related the emotion of worry. The Metal element is represented in the Lung, Large Intestine, Nose, Skin and Hair. It is related to the emotion of grief. Experiencing any of these emotions in their raw form, persistently, can throw an element off balance. If left imbalanced, it will start to affect the other elements over time creating emotional, spiritual, and physical ailments. So how can you use crystals to create more balance in the body and emotions? By placing crystals on some of the same meridian points as an acupuncturist would, you can start to achieve balance. As with any modality, it takes a few treatments to create a shift and allow more positive flow in the body. Let's go over a few crystals now in relation to the elements. For the water element... Calcite, Sunstone and Rose Quartz are a few crystals that can help achieve balance You can place crystals on the back the knees or on the top part of the soles on the feet For the wood element... Moss Agate, Moonstone and Green Adventurine are a few crystals that can help achieve balance You can place crystals over the liver or on the front of the heel in line with the big toe For the fire element... Amber, Tourmaline, and Emerald are a few crystals that can help achieve balance You can place crystals by the armpit or in the palm of the hand For the earth element... Tourmaline, Smoky Quartz, and Black Kyanite are a few crystals that can help achieve balance You can place crystals on the throat or on the top of the leg where the leg meets the hip For the metal element...
