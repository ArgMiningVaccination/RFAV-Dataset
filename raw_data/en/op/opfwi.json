Integrative medicine consultation This is an assessment performed by a physician with training and experience in Integrative Medicine. During the consultation, the physician obtains not only a full medical history and performs a physical examination, but also assesses the patient's emotional, mental and social well-being. A treatment plan is developed in collaboration with the patient. Recommendations may include use of dietary supplements and botanicals, changes in eating and physical activity, mind-body procedures, such as meditation, acupuncture and massage, and referrals to practitioners of other healing systems such as Traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurveda (a holistic medicine system from India) or homeopathy. Medical acupuncture Medical Acupuncture is the term used to describe acupuncture performed by a doctor trained and licensed in Western medicine and who has also received training in acupuncture as a specialty practice.

Wellness coaching Wellness coaching is a relational approach to working with patients who want to improve their health and wellbeing. Similar to working with a sport coach, this entails developing goals that are specific, measurable, action- oriented, realistic and time-based, otherwise known as SMART goals. Coaches employ motivational interviewing methods to identify a person's reasons for making change and work through ambivalent thoughts that can impede the process for change. Although there are formal health coaching programs, all integrative medicine physicians and other practitioners are trained in health coaching and weave this into their practice.
