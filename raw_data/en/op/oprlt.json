Learning Objectives 1. Determine the indications, treatment guidelines, contraindications, side effects, and antidotes of commonly used anticoagulants. 2. Summarize the key aspects of providing safe, qualit y nursing care to the patient receiving anticoagulati on therapy. Introduction Anticoagulants are key medications for treatment of thromboembolic events such as myocardial pulmonary embolism (PE). Anticoagulants are also key medications for the prevention of thromboembolic events such as patient with heart valve replacement, patients with atrial fibrillation, medical patients, and pat ients who have had surgeries, such as knee/hip replacements. The anticoagulants must be carefully monitored to maintain a balance between preventing thrombi and causing excessive bleeding. Anticoagulant therapy is the administration of medi cations to stop thrombosis and achieve the following result: \u0001 Disrupt the blood's natural clotting mechanism when there is a risk of clotting. \u0001 Prevent formation of a thrombus in immobile and/or postoperative patients. \u0001 Intercept the extension of a thrombus once it has f ormed. BHSF Clinical Learning June 2014 Page 2 For at least fifty years, salicylic acid acetate (Aspirin) has been recognized as an anticoagulant that can significantly reduce platelet count. It is the most common and often used blood thinner, usually taken in doses of 81 mg per day (e ssentially one baby aspirin). The mechanism of action is platelet aggregation inhibition. Addit ional types of anticoagulants include warfarin (Coumadin) given oral almost 60 years ago, warfarin sodium is by far the oral anticoagulant of choice. This is quickly changing as new, improved anticoagulants undergo clinical trials and enter the market. The oral anticoagulants are a class of phar maceuticals that act by antagonizing the effects of vitamin K. It is important to note that they take at least 48 to 72 hours for the anticoagulant effect to fully develop. In cases whe n an immediate effect is required, heparin must be given concomitantly. Generally, warfarin is used to treat patients with deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, atrial fibril lation, and mechanical prosthetic heart valves. Oral anticoagulants can only be used to pre vent clots, not to assist in eliminating them. CONTRAINDICATIONS \u0002 Pregnancy \u0002 Hemorrhagic tendencies or blood dyscrasias \u0002 or contemplated surgery of: (1) central nerv ous system; (2) eye; (3) traumatic surgery resulting in large open surfaces. \u0002 Bleeding tendencies associated with active ulcerati on or overt bleeding. \u0002 Inadequate laboratory facilities. \u0002 Unsupervised patients with senility, alcoholism, or psychosis or other lack of patient cooperation and compliance. \u0002 Spinal puncture and other diagnostic or therapeutic procedures with potential for uncontrollable bleeding. \u0002 Major regional, lumbar block anesthesia, malignant hypertension and known hypersensitivity to warfarin or to any other compon ents of this product. POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS Warfarin sodium can cause major or fatal bleeding. Bleeding is more likely to occur during the starting period and with a higher dose (resulting i n a higher INR), or in patients with the risk factors listed above. The most serious risks associ ated with warfarin sodium treatment are hemorrhage in any tissue or organ and, less frequen tly, the destruction of skin tissue cells (necrosis) or gangrene. The risk of hemorrhage usua lly depends on the dosage and length of treatment. BHSF Clinical Learning June 2014 Page 3 OTHER SIDE EFFECTS OF COUMADIN INCLUDE \u0002 Easy bruising \u0002 Blood in stool \u0002 OVERDOSE SYMPTOMS Suspected or overt abnormal bleeding (e.g., appeara nce of blood in stools or urine, hematuria, excessive menstrual bleeding, melena, petechiae, ex cessive bruising or persistent oozing from superficial injuries) are early manifestations of a nticoagulation beyond a safe level. What Is PT/INR? Prothrombin Time The prothrombin time is the time it takes plasma to clot after addition of tissue factor (obtained fro m animals). This measures the quality of the extrinsi c pathway (as well as the common pathway) of coagulation. International Normalized Ratio Because of differences between batches from the var ious manufacturers of tissue factor (it is a biologically obtained product), the INR was devised to standardize the results. Each manufacturer gives an ISI (International Sensi tivity Index) for any tissue factor they make. The ISI value indicates how the particular batch of tissue factor compares to an internationally standardized sample. The ISI is usually between 1.0 and 1.4. The INR is the ratio of a patient's prothrombin tim e to a normal (control) sample, raised to the power of the ISI value for the control sample used. (INR=(PT patient/PT normal) ISI ) Caution Prior to and Post Surgery: Oral anticoagulants should be discontinued prior to surgery to reduce the risk of hemorrhage in the intra-operative phase. Depending of the oral anticoagulants and the type of procedures the drugs must be held 24 hours to 5 days before surgery. In general oral anticoagulants are re-started 12-24 hours post surgery once hemostasis has been established. BHSF Clinical Learning June 2014 Page 4 Nursing Alert For Patients Receiving Anticoagulants Prothrombin Time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) are the coagulation tests used to monitor the anticoagulation effects of warfarin on all treated patients. Prothrombin Time (PT) - The prothrombin time is the time it takes plasma to clot after addition of tissue factor (obtained from animals). This mea sures the quality of the extrinsic pathway (as well as the common pathway) of coagulation. International Normalized Ratio (INR) - The ratio of a patient's prothrombin time to a n ormal (control) sample, raised to the power of the International Se nsitivity Index (ISI) value for the control sample used. INR was devised to standardize the results due to d ifferences between batches from various manufacturers of tissue factor. You must obtain a baseline INR prior to initiation of therapy, and a current INR must be available and used to monitor and adjust Coumadin t herapy. Patients should have an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 for basic \"blood-thinning\" needs. For some p atients who have a high risk of clot formation, the INR needs to be higher (about 2.5 to 3.5 times the control). Based on the type of anticoagulation agents, monito r the following lab values: \u0002 (get baseline and daily) \u0002 Lovenox (enoxaparin) ......Platelets ( get baseline, da ily X days, then every 48hrs) \u0002 Arixtra (fondaparinux) ......Platelets ( get baseline, daily X 5 days, then every 48 hours) \u0002 Pradaxa (dabigatran) .........No lab values but assess fo r signs of bleeding \u0002 Xarelto (rivaroxaban) ........No lab values but assess for signs of bleeding \u0002 Eliquis (apixaban) ..............No lab values but assess for signs of bleeding 1. Assess for Bleeding : \u0002 Nose bleed \u0002 Gum bleeding \u0002 Hematuria or blood) or hemorrhage \u0002 Vomiting ground materials \u0002 skin for bruising, hematomas \u0002 Prolonged excessive menses \u0002 Severe persistent back BHSF Clinical Learning June 2014 Page 5 2. Educate Patients on Recognizing Signs of Hyper/Hypo -Coagulation. \u0002 Tenderness , swelling or pain in extremity \u0002 Sudden chest pain \u0002 New or increased shortness of breath \u0002 Extreme restlessness \u0002 Fever Heparin and Derivatives Heparin was hailed as a \"miracle blo od lubricant\" and used widely to decrease the morbidity and mortality of acute care patients. Usually made from pig intestines, it works by activating antithrombin III, which blocks thromb in from clotting blood. Heparin (also described as unfractionated heparin) usually requir es hospitalization for careful monitoring of the activated PTT and monitoring for potential side effects. The anticoagulant action and side effects of heparin are dose dependent. The two majo r side effects are bleeding and heparin- induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). What is heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)? is the development of thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count), due to the administration of various forms of heparin, an anticoagulant. HIT is caused by the formation of abnormal antibodies that activate platelets and can be confirmed with specific blood tests.

BHSF Clinical Learning June 2014 Page 12 DIETARY RESTRICTIONS & POTENTIAL FOR DRUG INTERACTI ONS Warfarin sodium can interact with a very wide variety of dr ugs, both prescription and over-the-counter. Patients must check with their ph ysician before taking ANY other medication, herbal product, or vitamin/mineral supplement. They must be extremely cautious with complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) produc ts, including herbal remedies and supplements because many of these are known to inte ract with Warfarin sodium or otherwise affect coenzyme Q10, bromelains, galric, ginkgo biloba, fish oils, and many more. Diet substances f or weight loss (such as pills) should also be cautioned as some may contain substances that are c ontraindicated. Some substances, such as alcohol, can affect the PT/INR test. Antibiotics, aspirin, and cimetidine can increase t he PT/INR. Barbiturates, oral contraceptives or hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) , and vitamin K - either in a multivitamin or liquid nutrition supplements (suc h as Boost) - can decrease PT. Consumption of vitamin K rich foods in excess of a patient's usual intake can alter PT results. Vitamin K rich foods are usually frozen/cooked dark green vegetables. Other foods that contribute due to the additive effect of eating too much of them include energy/supplement bars and soybean/canola oil (usually in processed a nd fast foods). The main dietary concern of taking warfarin has to do with keeping a consistent amount of vitamin K in the diet from week to week. Follow the following precautions to Prevent Bleedin g: \u0002 Handle patient carefully while turning and positioning \u0002 Maintain pressure on IV and venipuncture sites for at least 5 minutes \u0002 Assist with ambulation and keep walkways /hallways free from cluster to prevent falls. \u0002 Avoid IM injections BHSF Clinical Learning June 2014 Page 13 Anticoagulants and Drug interactions: A wide variety of drugs, both prescription and over - the-counter, interact with warfarin and affect its PT/INR. Some of these medications are ibuprofen, naproxen, multi-symptom cold relievers and medications that may contain aspirin, (e.g. as Alka-Seltzer and Pepto-Bismol), stomach acid reducers stomach acid reducers (e.g., Tagamet), antidepressants, antibiotics, and thyroid drugs. Herbal remedies such as garlic, gre en tea, ginkgo, ginger, St. John's Wort, and fish oil also affects warfarin. Refer to appendix 1 on the next page for a more detailed list. The other three oral anticoagulants, Pradaxa, Xarel to and Eliquis have less drug-drug interactions than warfarin and no herbal remedies i nteractions. All anticoagulants must be used in caution when taking concomitantly with antiplate lets such as aspirin, clopidogrel and ticagrelor or NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and ketorola c. Foods and Anticoagulants: While diet does affect warfarin and PT/INR levels, the most important thing to remember is that warfarin works best if you keep your diet cons istent. Avoid drinking cranberry or grapefruit juice or any cranberry or grapefruit products. Vita min K is important for blood to clot. Since warfarin works to keep blood from clotting, foods h igh in vitamin K content decrease the ability of warfarin to thin the blood. Please note that vi tamin K should NOT be avoided, but rather, foods high in vitamin K should be consumed in a con sistent amount. Foods Containing Vit. K Amount Vit.

NPSG.03.05.01 Reduce the likelihood of harm to patients and resid ents associated with the use of anticoagulant therapy. --Rationale for NPSG.03.05.01\u2014 Anticoagulation therapy can be used as therapeutic treatment for a number of conditions, the most common of which are atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and mechanical heart valve implant. However, it is impo rtant to note that anticoagulation medications are more likely than others to cause ha rm due to complex dosing, insufficient monitoring, and inconsistent patient or resident co mpliance. This Goal has great potential to positively impact the safety of patients on this cl ass medications and result in better outcomes. Effective anticoagulation education includes face-t o-face interaction with a trained professional who works closely with patients and residents to be sure that they understand the risks involved with anticoagulation therapy, the precautions they need to take, and the need for regular International Normalized Ratio (INR) monitoring. Th e use of standardized practices for anticoagulation therapy that include patient and re sident involvement can reduce the risk of adverse drug events associated with heparin (unfrac tionated), low molecular weight heparin, and warfarin. Elements of Performance for NPSG.03.05.01 1. Use only oral unit-dose products, prefilled syri nges, or premixed infusion bags when these types of products are available. Note: For pediatri c patients and residents, prefilled syringe products should be used only if specifically design ed for children. 2. Use approved protocols for the initiation and ma intenance of anticoagulant therapy. 3. Before starting a patient or resident on warfari n, assess the patient's or resident's baseline coagulation status; for all patients and residents receiving warfarin therapy, use a current International Normalized Ratio (INR) to adjust this therapy. The baseline status and current INR are documented in the clinical record. 4. Use authoritative resources to manage potential food and drug interactions for patients and residents receiving warfarin. 5. When heparin is administered intravenously and c ontinuously, use programmable pumps in order to provide consistent and accurate dosing. 6. A written policy addresses baseline and ongoing laboratory tests that are required for anticoagulants. 7. Provide education regarding anticoagulant therap y to prescribers, staff, patients, residents, and families. Patient/resident/family education inc ludes the following: - The importance of follow-up monitoring - Compliance - Drug-food interactions - The potential for adverse drug reactions and inter actions 8. Evaluate anticoagulation safety practices, take action to improve practices, and measure the effectiveness of those actions in a time frame dete rmined by the organization.
