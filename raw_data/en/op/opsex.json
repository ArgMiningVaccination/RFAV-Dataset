It also includes medical device reporting, patient's rights, Safety Data Sheets (SDS) and workplace safety. The manual has links to associated UC Davis Health Policies as well as websites. Objectives After reviewing this manual , individual s should be able to: Identify patient rights. Identify components of a safe workplace. Discuss environment of care. Discuss the importance of infection prevention. Introduction UC Davis Health is the only academ ic health system in the region that views healthcare on a regional, national, and even international leve l for areas that are vulnerable and need improvement. Annual training is an opportunity to be current with topics of import ance and polish skills that may not have been used recently. Reviews of personal skills and/or information deficits are assisted through regulatory agencies and accreditation organizations. Therefore, the UC Davis Health workforce should take the opportunity t o benefit from the work put in by regulatory agencies and the UC Davis Health departments in identifying key areas of focus to provide person -centered c are in the best way, at the best time, and in the best place - UC Davis Health. Accreditation UC Davis Medical Center is accredited and surveyed by several regulatory and accreditation entities that are responsible for: providing oversight and monitoring of healthcare practitioners and facilities, provid ing information about changes within the healthcare industry, promot ing patient safety , and ensur ing regulatory compliance and quality services are rendered on behalf of patients. Federal, state, and local regulatory and accreditation agencies establish rules, standard s, or guidelines for healthcare facilities and mandate compliance to ensure a culture of safety fo r all patients, visitors, and healthcare employees. Accreditation entities such as The Joint Commission, an independent not -for-profit organization that accredits hospitals on behalf of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), are dedicated to raising UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 8 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL the level of quality and safety of healthcare provided through the accreditation or certification process. Accreditation or Program Certification is considered a symbol of quality within the healthcare industry, with the Join t Commission being considered one of the nation's predomina nt health standards -setting bodies . National Patient Safety Goals The Joint Commission is one of nine hospital and health services accrediting agencies accepted by CMS to provide deemed -status in the United States, providing o versight for hospitals and other healthcare facilities . The 20 23 National Patient Safety Goals can be found at: https://www.jointcommission.org/standards_information/npsgs.aspx A synopsis of the National Patient Safety Goals is in Appendix A . Emergency Codes UC Davis Health uses several codes to announce events that require an urgent response: Code Blue for medical emergency Code Rainbow for child abduction Code Red for fire Code Pink for newborn emergency event Code C for emergency cesarean section Code Elopement for a patient who lacks capacity and is identified as absent and unable to be immediately located Code Triage for Emergency Department Decompression Active Shooter for person s actively attempting to harm or kill others Code Green for internal or external disasters Code White for chemical spills ( view here ) Each of these codes has a different response protocol. UC Davis Health workforce should speak with their managers about the purpose of each code, and their potential role in responding to each of them. Emergency Management The goal of emergency management in a healthcare setting is to continue to pr ovide quality care to all patients in a safe environment, regardless of the incident, event, or disaster situation. Staff will use the Hospital Incident Command System (HICS) in the UC Davis Health Hospital Command Center (HCC) to UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 9 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL organize the response, as sign roles, and assess the situation - what happened, how it impacted the organization, and to determine prior ity response actions. The Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) details the functions of the Emergency Management Program and describes how UC Davis Health will respond to all types of emergencies as an organization. Click here to see the most current version of the COOP and our scenario -specific response plans . UC Davis Health staff form an integral part of all emergency response s, all workers should speak with their manager about their department's rol e in a disaster response. Disaster exercises to test the effectiveness of the Emergency Operations Plan are held throughout the year - get involved, participate in the next exercise! A red Disaster Manual containing specific instructions for the unit is maintained by each department. The UC Davis Health workforce should be familiar with the manual and its contents - ask your department manager for more details. Click here to see the updated red Disaster Manual contents . Contact the Emergency Management team at hs-ep@ucda vis.edu with any questions. Notification and Response UC Davis Health alerts staff of urgent situations through overhead paging, phone calls, texts, desktop alerts, and email. Some of these alerts are from the WarnMe sys tem. The ability to get these urgent messages to the right people depends upon each staff member updating their information in the WarnMe system. Annual updates to contact information (including email addresses and mobile numbers), building/location, and department are mandatory. All ucdavis.edu email addresses are automatically uploaded into WarnMe , and UCDH employees can add additional contact information . To update your WarnMe information , visit this website: http://intranet.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/emergencypreparedness/warn_me.shtml To receive Sacramento County emergency alert notifications, visit this website: www.Sacramento - Alert.org Code Green Code Green is for incidents taking place within the hospital and the community. Widespread disasters or other situations may dramatically increase the number of patients arriving at the hospital and/or may affect the ability of the hospital to function or pr ovide patient care. Examples are a mass casualty event like a multi -vehicle crash, a flood that disrupts traffic and interrupts supply deliveries, or a cybersecurity incident affecting IT infrastructure or applications . UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 10 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Staff Roles and Responsibilities Department managers and supervisors have the ultimate responsibility to implement emergency management response actions at the department level. Refer to the department or unit's red Disaster Manual for specific information on the unit's role and responsibili ties in a disaster. The red binder website contains links to the Continuity of Operations Plan/Emergency Operations Plan, Facility Evacuation policy, the Fire and Evacuation or Relocation Plan for the building or area, and the department specific emergency plan(s). It is essential that UC Davis Health workforce become familiar with their department's emergency plans and procedures. An individual's role and reporting structure may or may not change in a disaster. If there is a major event, report to your us ual supervisor at the next scheduled shift unless specifically instructed otherwise. Emergency Management Training and Education UC Davis Health provides education and training based on the prioritized risks identified as part of the Hazard Vulnerability Analysis and Continuity of Operations Plan. Initial education and training in emergency management is provided to all new staff and to existing staff. This training includes roles and responsibilities during disasters and responding to the Ho spital Command Center for those that are designated. Personal Preparedness UC Davis Health staff regularly prepare s for disasters at work, and personal p reparedness should also include readiness for situations that arise outside of work. UC Davis Health's Personal Preparedness website has information to help employees and their families prepare for the unexpected. The site in cludes information and a checklist based on recommendations from the American Red Cross, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and regional emergency response organizations. The experts recommend the following three basics: Have an emergency kit and \" grab and go\" bag in the home, office, and car Have a plan to get out, meet up , and communicate with family Have a way to stay informed of emerging and changing situations For additional information visit the Personal Preparedness website: http://intranet.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/emergencypreparedness/personal_preparedness.shtml Evacuation Procedures and Expectations Hospital bu ildings are designed to defend in place, permit time to extinguish a fire, and to move patients to safety, if needed. The preferred order of strategies in case of fire or a hazardous condition in the hospital building is to: (1) Defend in place or shelter in place - stay where you are UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 11 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL (2) Horizontal Relocation - move to another smoke compartment on the same floor (3) Vertical Relocation - move to another smoke compartment on a different floor (4) Evacuation from the building - patients will be staged for evacuation. Elevators will be used first for non -ambulatory or limited ambulatory patients and other evacuation equipment will be used only if necessary. The decision to relocate within the hospital or evacuate from a non -hospital building can be authorized by management (charge nurse, manager, nursing supervisor, practice manager, associate medical director, building coordinator, or building manager) or emergency responders. Code Green will be initiated for any incident that triggers the reloca tion or evacuation of inpatients. The decision to evacuate an entire wing or the whole hospital can only be authorized by the Hospital Incident Commander. Be familiar with exit routes as indicated in evacuation plans and departmental emergency response plans located in the red Disaster Binder. If directed, move patients away from immediate danger and, if necessary, request assistance when moving patients. Remember to reassure patients when moving them - their safety and the safety of our staff is our highes t priority. Management of the Environment of Care The goal of managing the environment of care is to provide a safe, functional, supportive , and effective environment for patients, staff members, and other individuals in the hospital. Effective managemen t includes using processes and activities to: Reduce and control environmental hazards Prevent accidents and injuries Maintain safe conditions for patients, visitors , and staff Maintain an environment that is sensitive to patients' needs for comfort, socia l interaction, positive distraction , and self -control Maintain an environment that minimizes unnecessary environmental stresses for patients, visitors , and staff The Joint Commission identifies six environments of care management plans. They are: 1. Safety Ma nagement 2. Hazardous Materials and Waste Management 3. Fire Prevention Management 4. Security Management 5. Medical Equipment Management 6. Utility Systems Management UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 12 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Workplace Safety Most safety -related services are provided by Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S) and Health Physics. Services are available by calling the numbers listed , referring to the campus phone directory, or e - mailing EH&S at hs-safety@ucdavis.edu . Environmental Health & Safety 916-734-2740 Health Physics 916-734-3355 The UC Davis Health Safety Management Plan guides the implementation of the safety program , including plans for injury and illness preventi on, exposure to airborne hazards and blood -borne pathogens, prevention of ergonomic injuries , and safety measures for other common hazards. Copies of the Safety Management Plan are available on the Environmental Health and Safety website or by calling EH&S. UC Davis Health workforce can access the Environmental Health and Safety website from the intranet by typing \"safety /\" in their web browser address bar. The Safety Management Plan sets the standard for safety ma nagement and is complemented by the UCDH Injury and Illness Prevention Plan and departmental safety programs and activities. Implementation of the Injury and Illness Prevention Plan is a requirement of Federal and State regulations and UC Davis Health Policy 1620 Departmental Injury Prevention Plan s and Safety Coordinators . The Safety Committee and Health and Safety Officer play vital roles in ensuring the effective implementation of the plan. Department managers and supervisors implement the plan at the department level. Refer to the green Injury Prevention Plan binder in the department for more information on safety activities in the department. The depar tment will also have a safety coordinator who plays a key role in identifying safety hazards and distributing safety information. Health and safety information is communicated to employees in writing as UC Davis and Health System policies and procedures as well as through unit -specific procedures, training sessions, bulletin board postings, newsletters, intranet postings, meetings, and announcements. The Insider is where important notices and resources are posted for employees. Safety Training Training is essential for safety. Staff will need to take a refresher on this training every year and department and job -specific safety training, which may be provided in various ways , including drills, in - services, bulletin board postings , and educational posters. UC Davis Health workforce is encouraged to ask questions if they are unsure how to perform a job safely. Hazar d Identification and Reporting Work locations are regularly inspected , and deficiencies are noted by EH&S or by department Safety Coordinators. After an inspection, the UC Davis Health workforce may be required to implement corrective actions. UC Davis Hea lth workforce is encouraged to report hazards to their supervisor or safety coordinator. UC Davis Health workforce may also notify hazards directly to EH&S by phone, email , UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 13 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL using the online incident reporting system , or complet e a Hazard Report Form (avail able as UC Davis Health P olicy 1605 , attachment 1 ). Hazard Report Forms may be submitted anonymously through the UC Davis Health mail system. If other methods of reporting and correcting workplace hazards are unsuccessful, the UC Davis Health workforce has the right to contact Cal/OSHA or The Joint Commission. Employees may not be disciplined for reporting problems in this manner. If the hazard represen ts an emergency, arrange to have someone stay by the location to warn others, if necessary, and call 9 -1-1. COVID -19 Prevention Training Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2). Read more about the Injury and Illness Prevention Program , designed to provide you with a safe work environment in Appendix C . It contains key components designed to help you identify hazards and implement controls to reduce the risk of transmission. Injuries and Accidents As a part of the safety program , accidents are i nvestigated and corrective actions are implemented to prevent future incidents. Occupational Injury or Illness Report any occupational injury or illness to supervisors as soon as possible.

When there are similar precautionary statements for chemicals with multiple hazards, the most protective information will be included on the label. Name, address and phone number of the chemical manufacturer, distributor, or importer. Information on the labels can be used to ensure proper storage of hazardous chemicals and may als o be used to quickly locate information on first aid when needed by employees or emergency personnel. Where a chemical has multiple hazards, different pictograms are used to identify the various hazards. Information on the labels is related to the informa tion on the SDS; for example, the precautionary statements on the label would be the same as on the SDS. If the product label is different than SDS, you must follow product labeling requirements first. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 21 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Pictograms and Hazard Classes OSHA's required pictograms on hazardous material containers are being standardized and are presented below. The pictograms must be in the shape of a square set at a point and include a black hazard symbol on a white background with a red frame sufficiently wide enough to be clearly visible. OSHA has designated eight pictograms under this standard for application to a hazard category. Oxidizers Flammables Self-Reactive Pyrophorics Organic Peroxides Acute toxicity (severe) Corrosives Gases Under Pressure Carcinogen Respiratory Sensitizer Reproductive Toxicity Target Organ Toxicity Mutagenicity Aspiration Toxicity Environmental Toxicity Irritant Dermal Sensitizer Acute toxicity (harmful) Narcotic Effects Respiratory Tract Irritation Spill Response If UC Davis Health personnel work with hazardous materials, make sure they know chemical emergency information such as the location of the emergency eyewash and spill kit. For a spill, immediately assess whether the spill is a non -hazardous material, an identifiable hazardous material or an unknown. For UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 22 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL unknown materials or for hazardous materials exceeding capabilities to respond, call 911 and isolate the area. Stay in a safe location near the spill to provide information to responders. Avoid the possibility of spreading contamination beyond the affected area. Report details of the incident to EH&S via a phone call to 916 -734-2740, by using the online incident reporting system or by completing a Hazardous Substance Incident Checklist (available as UC Davis Health Policy 1612, attachment 1 ). All staff should know how to respond to a Code White, indicating a hazardous material emergency, usually involving a chemical spill. Follow the di rections of response personnel and stay out of affected areas. Be prepared to take an alternate route if the normal paths are closed during a response. For additional information see Respo nse to Hazardous Substance Spills, UC Davis Health Policy 1612 and UC Davis Health Policy 1623 Management of Hazardous Drug Waste and Spills . Exposure Control and Engineering Controls To reduce UC Davis Health workforce exposure to hazardous material the following rules can be applied: reduce the hazard class of the material whenever possible by substituting a less hazar dous material, reduce the time of exposure, increase the distance from the hazard, and wear protective equipment as required. The proper operation and use of engineering controls, such as biological safety cabinets and fume hoods, is vital to assure everyo ne's safety and protection against workplace hazards. Cancer Causing Materials Cancer causing materials, such as asbestos or ionizing radiation, may be used or be present in UC Davis Health workforce work area. Know these materials and treat them with resp ect. Refer to the section titled \" Asbestos \" for additional information regarding asbestos in UC Davis Health buildings. Information about the safe use of ionizing radiation is available in the UC Davis Radiation Safety Manual and in the section title \" Radiation \" in this manual . Some hazardous drugs may also cause cancer. Information on hazardous drugs is included below. Code White: Chemical Spill Response Code White indicates a hazardous material emerg ency, usually involving a chemical spill. Follow the directions of response personnel and stay out of affected areas. Be prepared to take an alternate route if the normal path is closed during a response. Managing Drugs - Employee Exposure, Spills , and Was te What is a hazardous drug? Hazardous drug is a new term used to refer to many drugs that may cause health effects from exposures at work and include some commonly used drugs, such as drugs that kill cancer cells (chemotherapy or antineoplastic drugs). A list of hazardous drugs used at UC Davis Health is included as an attachment to UC Davis Health Policy 10001 , which governs the use of hazardous drugs. H azardous drugs should only be handled by staff that have received appropriate training. If in doubt, treat all drugs as hazardous drugs. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 23 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Health risks of hazardous drugs The most common route of exposure is through the skin, especially by handling the drug s. Hazardous drugs may cause health effects, such as cancer, damage to your genes (your DNA) or body organs, can cause a pregnant woman to have a baby that does not develop properly or affect the ability of both men and women to have children. Short -term h ealth effects such as rash, hair loss , and nausea are also possible, but are seen with high exposures (such as in patients who are receiving the drugs in chemotherapy). Minimize exposure to hazardous drugs by following proper work practices Assume all drug s are hazardous drugs unless you know otherwise. Do not handle drugs or clean up spills involving drugs unless you have received appropriate training. Obey signs that restrict entry to spill cleanup areas and to specific hazardous drugs work areas. Drug spills and waste UC Davis Health Policy 1630 Pharmaceutical Waste Management , outlines the management of all types of pharmaceutical waste. UC Davis Health Policy 1623 Management of Hazardous Drug Waste and Spills , gives detailed instructions for hazardous drug spills and waste disposal. The presence of a liquid or powder in an area where hazardous drugs are handled is the most likely sign of a spill. Do not rely on odor or other such indicators. Pharmacy and patient care areas are responsible for the appropriate handling of waste pharmaceutic als. With few exceptions, disposing of waste pharmaceuticals in the sink, toilet , or trash is prohibited. Non- hazardous waste pharmaceutical containers in patient care areas are typically disposed of in blue containers and hazardous waste pharmaceutical co ntainers are typically disposed of in black containers. Additional information is available on the EH&S website . Cryogenic Liquid Management Cryogenic liquids, usua lly liquid nitrogen, are used in many areas of UC Davis Health, particularly in laboratories. Inappropriate handling of cryogenic liquids can lead to skin burns and frostbite (due to extremely low temperatures), container ruptures, or asphyxiation from oxy gen displacement if large quantities of the liquid are released into a room. Personnel handling or transferring cryogenic fluids must wear appropriate personnel protective equipment, including chemical splash goggles, face shield, loose -fitting waterproof cryogenic gloves, and lab coat or cryogenic apron. Safe work practice information is available at UC Davis Health Policy 1624 Safe Management of Cryogenic Liquid s. A training presentation is available in the Hazardous Materials section of the EH&S website . Liquid oxygen poses special hazards. In addition to stored pressure and burn hazards, it is a concentrated oxidizer. When exposed to liquid oxygen, most organic materials become extremely easy to ignite , and some will even detonate (such as asphalt). Oils, greases, clothing, bed linens, plant material, and plastic s should never come into contact with liquid oxygen. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 24 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Oxygen and Other Compressed Gas Cylinders Compressed gas cylinders are used in healthcare , research , and support activities. All cylinders present significant physical hazards due to pressur ized gases contained within . The cylinders may also present a potential chemical hazard, which commonly contain oxygen and other oxidizers that may contribute to fire hazards , but may also contain any gas with its own set of chemical hazards . See UC Davis Health Policy 1685 Handling and Storage of Compressed Medical Gas , for specific rules on storage, transportation, and use of oxygen cylinders. Persons using or handling cylinders should have basic training including review of operating and safety protocols for tasks to be performed , review of appropriate Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for toxic gases , and hands -on training by an experienced gas cylinder user. Trans port cylinders larger than lecture bottle size with a hand truck or cylinder cart. Rolling or \"walking\" cylinders are extremely hazardous. Never transport a cylinder with a regulator attached! Always protect the valve during transport by replacing the valv e cover. Cylinders must never be left without some type of physical support or restraint such as a stand, a cart, or a cylinder storage rack. Medical gas cylinders should never be placed loosely on top of a bed or gurney. Store cylinders in a well-ventilat ed area away from ignition sources. In addition to the requirements for compressed gas cylinder storage, oxygen cylinders must be further segregated in a designated and approved space as FULL, PARTIAL, and EMPTY, with the appropriate markings over the stor age rack. For example: Empty cylinders must be stored in a room separate from the storage room used for full and partial cylinders. Additional information on the management and storage of Compressed Gas Cylinders is available in SafetyNet #60 . Report gas cylinder problems to Distribution (916 -703-4040) with follow up to EH&S.

It is against the law to have waste in an unlabeled container! Radioactive waste pick -up - call Health Physics at 916-734-3355. Medical Waste Management Medical Waste means any biohazardous, pathology, trace chemotherapy, and pharmaceu tical waste not regulated by the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA). A) Biohazardous waste - at the point of disposal contains recognizable fluid human blood, fluid blood products, containers or equipment containing blood , or blood from animals known to be infected or potentially infected with pathogen that are highly communicable to humans. All biohazardous waste must be placed in red biohazardous waste bags. Red bags must be contained in a hard -sided secondary container with tight fitting lid and have international biohazard symbol on the sides and lid. B) Pathology waste - comprised of specimens or tissues that are fixed in formaldehyde or other fixatives. Pathology waste shall be red bagged and immediately placed in a designated \"Pathology Waste\" container, which is typically around 20 -gallon container marked \"PATH - Incineration Only\". C) Sharps waste - any device having acute rigid corners, edges, or protuberances capable of cutting or piercing. Sharps waste is typically disposed of in a blue pharmaceutical waste container. Laboratory areas may dispose of sharps only waste in an appropriate rigid puncture -resistant sharps container. D) Trace Chemotherapy waste - items contaminated through contact, or having previously contained chemother apeutic agents, including but not limited to, gloves, disposable gowns, towels, and intravenous solution bags, and attached tubing that is empty. Trace chemotherapy waste must be placed in a rigid yellow container. Note: Waste must be handled as hazardous waste, rather than medical waste, if it contains chemotherapy agent that can be poured out (for liquids) or scraped out (for solids). Medical waste pickup is performed by EVS or a vendor (Stericycle). To request pickup for m edical waste (includes red bioh azardous waste containers, sharps waste containers, blue pharmaceutical waste containers, pathology waste containers, and yellow trace chemotherapy containers) , call Environmental Services at 916 -734-3777.

Eyewash and Emergency Shower Station An eyewash station and e mergency shower station must be available within 10 walking seconds (approximately 55 feet) from where employee may encounter or use hazardous substance which can cause corrosion, severe irritation, or permanent tissue damage to the eyes. The path of trave l from the hazard should be free of obstructions. PO&M coordinates vendor services for UC Davis Medical Center and all outl ying clinics. A vendor will test, flush, and maintain records related to plumbed eyewash and emergency stations. The vendor will plac e a tag on the unit to document the test/flush was performed. Departments are responsible for ensuring their eyewash station is being tested monthly by the vendor by examining the tag for completion in the last 30 days. If tag is missing on the eyewash sta tion, the department must contact PO&M at 916-734-2763. Exception: CAP -accredited laboratories must continue to flush stations and maintain records on a weekly basis. Eyewash Operation: In the event of an emergency, activate eyewash by pushing handle forw ard. Hold both eyelids open with thumb and forefingers. Roll eyeballs back and forth so fluid flows on all surfaces of eye and under eyelid. Remove contact lenses , if present. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 27 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Flush eyes for 15 minutes. After equipment use, seek a medical advisor immediat ely for further treatment. Emergency Shower Operation: In the event of an emergency, activate drench shower by pulling on the pull rod. Begin to remove any clothing and shoes exposed to chemical or other hazardous substance (If eyes have been exposed to hazardous materials, follow procedure for eyewash operation) Flush eyes, face, and body for 15 minutes. After equipment use, seek a medical advisor immediately for further treatment. Asbestos To provide building occupants with basic information about asbes tos containing materials commonly found in buildings. What Is Asbestos? The term asbestos refers to a family of naturally occurring minerals. These minerals have unique properties of chemical and fire resistance. \"Asbestos containing construction materials\" are those manufactured construction materials that contain more than one -tenth of 1 percent asbestos by weight (Section 25195, Chapter 104, Division 20 of the State of California Health & Safety Code) . Materials that contain asbesto s may be friable, meaning they can be easily crumbled with hand pressure. Health Risks The most common exposure to asbestos material is through breathing airborne fibers. When asbestos fibers are introduced into the respiratory system they can contribute to the development of: Asbestosis - a serious lung disease. Lung Cancer - the most common cancer associated with asbestos exposure. Mesothelioma - a rare cancer of the lining of the lung or abdominal cavities. MINIMIZE EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS FIBER S BY FOLLOWING PROPER WORK PRACTICES . Recognizing Asbestos Materials Common types of materials that may contain asbestos: Sprayed or t roweled on fireproofing and soundproofing installed prior to 1980 Boilers and pipes installed prior to 1980 are often ins ulated with asbestos materials Floor tiles in buildings constructed prior to 1985 Roofing felts and sheeting Floor and roof mastics and sealants UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 28 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Gaskets Actions to Take By taking the right action UC Davis Health workforce can reduce the risk of exposure to asbestos. Know where the asbestos is in the building and avoid disturbing it. Any building , regardless of age , may have asbestos -containing materials (ACM) present. If UC Davis Health workforce find materials that may contain asbestos, they should report them to their supervisor. UC Davis Health shall provide, at no cost to employees who perform housekeeping operations in areas which contains Asbestos Containing Construction Materials (ACCM), an asbestos awareness training course, which shall at a minimum contain the following elements: health effects of asbestos, locations of ACCM in the building/facility, recognition of ACCM damage and deterioration, requirements in the Cal OSHA standard relating to housekeeping, and proper response to fiber relea se episodes. Each such employee shall receive training annually. If UC Davis Health workforce see asbestos materials that have been disturbed, they should report the damage to their supervisor. If the maintenance of asbestos in the building is not being performed properly, see that it is brought to the supervisor's attention. Avoid Disturbing Asbestos Materials Avoid touching or disturbing suspect materials on walls, ceilings, pipes , or boilers. Asbestos fibers may be released when the material is disturbed . DO NOT drill holes in asbestos containing materials. DO NOT hang plants or anything else from ceiling covered with asbestos containing materials. DO NOT pin or hang pictures on walls covered with asbestos containing materials. DO NOT sand asbestos contai ning floor tiles or backing material. DO NOT damage asbestos containing materials while moving furniture, etc. DO NOT disturb asbestos containing material when replacing light bulbs, etc. DO NOT allow curtains, drapes, or dividers to damage asbestos contai ning materials. For asbestos information and assistance at UC Davis Health, call EH&S at 916 -734-2740. Wildfire Smoke Protection With the recent wildfire events in California, there have been episodes of increased wildfire smoke causing the air quality to become compromised , intermittently . The air quality is measured by local and state agencies with detectors in various locations and communicated daily on the internet - anyone with internet access can search for this information as it is free to the public . This measurement is called the Air Quality Index (AQI). The categories are broken down into 6 sections ranging from 'good' to 'hazardous' and ranging in color per category from green to maroon . This data is calculated using measurements of Particulate Ma tter (PM) 2.5 diameter micrometers (ultrafine particulate) in micrograms per cubic meter. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 29 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Two commonly used websites that can be visited to track the AQI at any time are: Airnow.gov Openmap.clarity.io The University has measures in place to inform you of, and protect you from, the dangers of inhaling wildfire smoke, for exa mple: Locate work in protected areas where air is filtered (enclosed buildings or vehicles) Change procedures (i.e. , move workers to a place with lower current AQI for PM2.5 \u2014 learn more about how air quality indicators below) Reduce work time in areas with unfiltered air Increase rest time and frequency; provide rest area with filtered air Reduce the physical intensity of work to help lower breathing and heart rates If you work outdoors or in an area with unfiltered air, yo u will receive additional training and information about how to remain safe during wildfire smoke events while at work. At AQI levels of 151 or greater for PM2.5, the University will take additional precautions to protect you from wildfire smoke . Contact y our supervisor for questions about additional protections that may be available to you. Fire Prevention Management Campus Fire Marshal's Office UC Davis Health has a unique designation to serve as the Lead Campus Fire Marshal on behalf of the California Of fice of the State Fire Marshal . This designation provides UCDH Fire Marshal's Office with the responsibility and authority to carry out fire and life safety regulations and reporting. Some examples of this responsibility include construction plan review an d inspection, fire and life safety inspections of existing buildings, regulations of hazardous materials storage, and The Joint Commission preparedness related to fire and life safety. Interim Life Safety Measures (ILSM) The Office assists other departme nts in the ILSM process by reviewing applications for ILSM for construction projects, as well as times when other fire and life safety deficiencies exist. The office will UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 30 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL review department ILSM recommendations for approval and conduct monthly area or depar tment monitoring for compliance with their ILSM document. ILSMs are required by The Joint Commission for all construction projects and during specific situations when fire and life safety deficiencies occur . ILSMs ensure that an acceptable level of fire an d life safety is maintained at all times. See UC Davis Health Policy 1635 . Teamwork Teamwork is essential for patient fire safety. UC Davis Health workforce should know their department's fire and evacuation plan thoroughly. The fire and evacuation plan is a component of the disaster plan (Red Binder). If the fire is not within the surrou nding area, 1) remain calm; 2) close patient doors, windows, and fire doors; and 3) ask visitors/patients to remain in their rooms. Code Red Code Red indicates a fire situation. Staff in affected areas must initiate their emergency response procedures as stated in their evacuation/relocation plan . Staff in the unaffected areas should discuss internal procedures, review fire plans and prepare to receive relocated patients, staff , or visitors who may have to leave an endangered area. See UC Davis Health Policy 1606 Code Red (Fire) Response and Procedures . Smoke Barriers Smoke barrier walls separate each floor of the hospital into two or more smoke compartmen ts. Smoke barriers are intended to create compartments to which building occupants can be safely and promptly relocated during a fire, thus preventing the need to have complete and immediate building evacuation. Doors in smoke barrier walls are identified with a small black and white sign located on the door that reads SMOKE BARRIER. Additionally, each departmental fire plan includes a floor plan showing each smoke barrier on the floor for which the fire plan is written. Each department should know the loca tion of smoke barriers and plan relocating patients to them in the event of an emergency. Fire Drills UC Davis Health conducts fire drills once per shift per quarter in the hospital and ambulatory care clinics , as well as annually in all freestanding clin ics. Staff participation in these drills is essential for an effective response during an actual fire. Fire Drills are not only required by The Joint Commission, but they also assist in training staff in \"Fire Readiness\" so that , in the event of an actual fire, the appropriate responses are known. All staff are required to participate in drills. UC Davis Health workforce should respond to a \"Code Red Drill\" announcement the same as an actual \"Code Red\" or fire. During each fire drill, all staff has a role t o fulfill. Supervisors shall observe the reaction of staff, review procedures, and provide feedback to staff on response. See UC Davis Health Policy 1652 Fire Drill Responsibilities and Reporting . UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 31 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Fire Emergency - R.A.C.E. R.A.C.E. is the acronym used to assist staff in remembering what to do in the event of a fire emergency. The individual letters of the acronym stand for the following: R is for Rescue -- Remove all persons from the danger area, including oneself . A is for Alarm -- Call 911 and activate the nearest fire alarm pull station. 911 calls initiated on UC Davis Health phones go to the UC Davis Dispatch Center. UC Davis dispatchers are familiar with the UC Davis Health and will promptly notify the appropriate agencies. 911 calls initiated on cell phones go to the California Highway Patrol 911 dispatcher. C is for Confine -- Confine the fire to the smallest area possible. Closing doors t o the fire room/area is a very important and required task to prevent the fire from spreading. E is for Extinguish -- UC Davis Health workforce should extinguish the fire only if the fire is the size of an office waste container or smaller and they are co mpetent in the use of a fire extinguisher. Classes of Fire There are 3 basic classes of fire: A, B, and C. Class A fires involve ordinary combustibles (trash, paper, and wood). Class B fires involve flammables or combustible liquids (gas, oil , or grease). Class C fires involve energized electrical equipment (ECG, exam lamp, computer). Use of Fire Extinguishers - P.A.S.S . Remember to read the label on the extinguisher. UC Davis has different types of fire extinguishers. The dry chemical or \"multi -purpose\" f ire extinguisher is the most common. The multi -purpose extinguisher can be used on all classes of fires (A, B, or C). If the fire is small (no larger than an office size trash can) , attempt to extinguish the fire; however, DO NOT PUT YOURSELF IN DANGER and always ensure there is an escape route. Once a fire starts, it could double in size every 30 seconds. An acronym utilized to assist UC Davis Health workforce in remembering how to operate a fire extinguisher is P.A.S.S. The individual letters of the acronym stand for the following: P is for Pull - Pull the pin located in the handle. A is for Aim - Aim the extinguisher at the base of the fire not at the smoke. S is for Squeeze - Squeeze the handle. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 32 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL S is for Sweep - Sweep the base of the fire. Start ing with the edge of the fire nearest to oneself, sweep from side to side until the fire is out or the extinguisher is empty. Discharge the extinguisher six to eight feet at the bas e of the fire. If the fire continues to burn, do not search for another extinguisher. Confine the fire by closing doors and leave the area immediately. Medical Gas Shutoff Valves Know the types of medical gases and the locations of all medical gas shutoff valves in one's area. The valve should be clearly labeled as to the areas/rooms they serve. Shutoff valves may not be blocked. If the valves are not labeled or incorrectly labeled, contact the Office at 916-734-3036. Review UC Davis Health Policy 1680 Emergency Shut -Off of Medical Oxygen in the Event of Fire for more information. Building Evacuation In the event of an alarm, some buildings and floors requ ire evacuation instead of relocation. If this is the case for one's building or floor; proceed to lowest level of the building via the exit stairs. Do not attempt to use the elevators. Use handrails while descending. All emergency exits are clearly marked to properly guide everyone to the exterior of the building. From there, please proceed to the designated assembly area. Any individual who cannot evacuate via the egress stairwells may be staged inside the stairwell. In buildings with areas of refuge, the individuals should assemble at that location and utilize notification devices if present. Notification devices are used to provide information to emergency responders. Alcohol -Based Hand -Rub Dispensers Alcohol -based hand -rub dispensers include those that are mounted as well as free -standing liquid containers. When dispensers are mounted in a corridor, the corridor must have a minimum width of 6 feet. The Joint Commission requires the placement of d ispensers with a minimum of four -feet horizontal spaci ng between them and not installed within one inch of an ignition source ( i.e., light switch, electrical outlet, etc.). Medical Equipment Management The Clinical Engineering Department is responsible for the repair, inspection, and maintenance of medical e quipment throughout the UC Davis Health. All medical equipment must be inspected and tagged by Clinical Engineering prior to initial clinical use regardless of how the equipment was acquired (e.g. , demo, borrowed, rental, purchase, lease, etc.) . Clinical Engineering Information For further information regarding medical equipment and/or Clinical Engineering services, call 916-734- 2846. Additional information is available by referring to the Clinical Engineering website (http://cehelp.UCDMC.ucdavis.edu ) or the online UC Davis Health policy and procedure manuals. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 33 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Training All medical equipment users are required to be able to properly operate medical equipment that is under their control. Periodic equipment training is required and is the department's responsibility. If there is a question about how to operate equipment, refer to the device's operator's manual on file in each department or ask one's immediate supervisor or departm ent manager. Equipment Failure and Reporting All equipment that is malfunctioning shall be taken out of service immediately. All equipment users are required to know where critical back up equipment is located and what procedures to follow when critical eq uipment fails. Broken equipment and/or equipment that is suspected to be out of calibration or otherwise not performing to its original specification must be reported to Clinical Engineering. Equipment Caused Injury As required by the FDA's Safe Medical De vices Act (SMDA), equipment that fails and causes or contributes to patient injury, patient illness , or patient death is required to be formally reported to the FDA and the medical device manufacturer. At UC Davis Health, the reporting procedure is to complete an online Incident Report through the Incident Reporting system, RLDatix . See UC Davis Health Policy 1466 Incident Reports . All equipment involved in the incident, including accessories and consumables , must be sequestered and Clinical Engineering notified immediately. Equipment Inspection Before each use of any electrical device, inspect the power cord and plug for broken insulation, loose screws, or bent prongs. Special attention should be given to the point where the cord and plug join as well a s the place where the cord enters the device. Electric Safety Water is a conductor of electricity. DO NOT place liquids on top of electrical devices . DO NOT set equipment on wet areas. DO NOT use equipment on which liquids have been spilled. Turn off or un plug equipment. DO NOT touch electrical equipment with wet hands. NO personally owned (staff, patients , or visitors) line powered (including battery charger) electrical devices are allowed in patient care areas at UC Davis Health. This restriction includes coffeepots, radios, and TVs. All \"loaned\" devices must be inspected and tagged by Clinical Engineering as electrically safe. There is an exception for patient -owned, battery powered laptop computers that have grounded or double -insulated battery chargers. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 34 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL NO adapters or two -pronged electrical devices shall be used at UC Davis Health. Two -pronged electrical devices are not grounded and their use in hospitals is a violation of California Code of Regulation, Title 22, and paragraph 70837(e). Labeled (e.g. , UL), double -insulated equipment is allowed. Avoid using extension cords. If it is absolutely necessary to use an extension cord, use only the yellow \"hospital grade,\" three -wire, heavy -duty type of extension cord. Extension cords for non -patient care equipme nt may only be used as temporary wiring for portable hand tools, or while a permanent electrical service is being installed. In non -patient care areas, extension cords may be used to serve a short -term research experiment not exceeding six months. Surge pr otectors for computer equipment shall not be used as extension cords. Extension cords shall not be used as a substitute for fixed wiring. Do not use extension cords where subject to physical damage or hazardous locations (e.g. , attached to buildings, walls , doors, windows, or under carpets). Relocatable power taps (RPTs), also known as power strips, or plug strips, for use in patient care areas shall meet the following requirements: labeled by their manufacturer as hospital grade, mounted (e.g. , on a rack, table, pedestal, or cart), have a total electrical current (amps), produce a draw of less than 75% of the RPT's listed capacity, and plugged directly into a wall outlet (i.e., not \"daisy -chained\"). Special Precautions for Electrically Sensitive Patients Special precautions need to be taken for \"electrically sensitive patients,\" e.g. , patients with central pressure lines, patients with external pacemakers. Recognize that a very small amount of electrical current (less than a normal healthy person can feel) can cause cardiac fibrillation if applied directly to the heart. Possible routes to the heart include fluid filled catheters placed in or near the heart and external pacemaker wires that inadvertently come into electrical contact with an ungrounded or othe rwise malfunctioning device. Electrically sensitive patients may commonly be found in critical care units, the cardiac catheterization laboratory, and the operating room. Radiation The Health Physics Office answers questions about radiation safety at 916-734-3355. After hours, the UC Davis Health Radiation Safety Officer can be reached by paging 916 -816-5538. Information is available on the intranet at http://intranet.UCDMC.ucdavis.e du/safety/hp/index.shtml . Health Physics is responsible for overseeing the safe and effective use of ionizing radiation within the Health System. X -Ray machines and radioactive material are used at UC Davis Health and the Primary Care Network for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, as well as in research and development. Title 17 of the California Administrative Code regulates the use of radiation. The University of California, Davis is issued a broad scope license that d etails the use conditions for all radioactive material at the University. The campus -wide Radiation Safety Committee and the Radiation Use Committee at UC Davis Health enforce these regulations. The UC Davis Radiation Safety Manual details the requirements for use of radiation producing machines and radioactive materials at UC Davis. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 35 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Radiation producing machines and radioactive materials at UC Davis Health are used under Radiation Use Authorizations (RUA) that are issued by the Health Physics Office to Department Managers and Principal Investigators. RUAs specify the conditions under which radioactive material s or radiation - producing machines may be used. All radioactive materials and radiation producing machines must be labeled with the radiation symbol. Periodic inspections are made to assure that this technology is being used in a safe and effective manner. Only per sonnel properly trained by the Health Physics Office or certified by the State of California should handle materials or devices labeled with the radiation symbol. These persons are considered Radiation Workers. Human subject research protocols and consent forms, which involve use of ionizing radiation from machines or radioactive materials, must be approved by the Radiation Use Committee. Applications are available at the website above. Only Health Physics staff is authorized to pick up and dispose of radio active materials. If UC Davis Health workforce see a box with the yellow and purple or yellow and black international radiation symbol (the trefoil , shown below ) on it and the box is in a location that UC Davis Health workforce do not think it should be, c all Health Physics (916 -734-3355). Radiation producing machines and radioactive materials are used throughout the hospital and research areas. Signs, such as the trefoil or the words \"Caution X -Ray\" or \"Caution Radioactive Material\", located at the entrance to the work area will identify th e presence of hazardous materials in the workplace. The trefoil alerts UC Davis Health workforce so that they can minimize the potential exposure to radiation by following the established protocols. This includes limiting the time of the exposure, increasi ng the distance between oneself and the radiation source, using radiation shielding, and wearing personal protective equipment as necessary. Basic rules to follow include: Follow all room postings or instructions carefully. Ask the laboratory personnel t o identify areas that should be avoided. Do not handle anything labeled with the radiation symbol (unless it is part of your job). Call the Health Physics Office (916 -734-3355) for any questions or concerns. Leave the room locked when unoccupied. Lead ap rons are available and must be worn in rooms when fluoroscopy is performed.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) uses magnetic fields, radio frequencies , and a computer to produce images of the inside of the body. The magnetic fields are not known to be harmful and are painless. MRI is effective in visualizing soft tissue, the brain, the joints, and the musculoskeletal an d vascular systems. The MRI poses specific safety hazards in that any magnetic object (e.g. , metal object) within the high magnetic field of the magnet will be pulled into the scanner and itself becom e a projectile. This could cause severe injuries to or e ven death of a patient or staff member as well as considerable damage to MRI equipment. To avoid a safety emergency, access to zones III and IV of the MRI suite is severely restricted. Screening of patients and staff is mandatory. Hospital staff must be aw are that the magnet is always on, and that the magnetic field cannot be seen or heard. The closer an object gets to the MRI , the stronger the magnetic force is (exponentially more) . This force can pull metal objects into the machine at great speed and can cause severe injury or death . Metal objects , such as gurneys, oxygen tanks, infusion pumps, tools, and other patient -use items containing metal that are not labeled as MR safe, cannot enter the MRI environment. All personnel approaching the area must be aw are of safety issues at all times. All staff and faculty who have a purpose to access MRI zone III or zone IV, such as a nurse, respiratory therapist, or environmental services are required to complete the online MRI Safety Training on an annual basis. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 38 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Hospital staff will need to consult with MRI Staff if a patient has a n implanted device, such as a pacemaker , to determine if the device is MR conditional. For the safety of the patient, physicians ordering an MRI are required to provide accurate information regarding known implants, prosthetics, pacemakers, or any other metallic objects. Patients with implanted devices that are not deemed MR conditional cannot be imaged or even come into the MRI prep area as the magnetic field may disrupt the function of thes e devices, which could result in death. Mechanically ventilated patients require special ventilators , oxygen tanks, and monitoring devices that are MR conditional . The MRI technologist or physician can supply the floor with the necessary instructions for t hese high -risk patients. Other devices, such as prosthesis, pumps, surgical clips , or metal fragments, will be screened to determine if they are MR conditional . Jewelry, hairpins, glasses, wigs, hearing aids, non -permanent dentures, etc., must be removed before entering zone III . Some of the safety precautions are: Warning signs posted on doors. Obtaining sufficient information about possible implants a patient has. This information should be provided by the ordering physician. The use of hand -held magnet scanners to help detect metal objects. Being cleared by the MRI technologist Refer to the UC Davis Health Policy 1727 Department of Radiology Magnetic Resonance Safety for additional information. Any staff that enter controlled MRI spaces must complete periodic training in accordance with this policy.

Information For further Informat ion regarding utility systems or PO&M services, call 916 -734-2763. Security Management UC Davis Health personal safety and security is important. The heart of the Health System's Security Program is outlined in the Security Management Plan, which describes how the UC Davis Health and UC Davis Police Department manage the physical and personal security of patients, staff , and visitors at UC Davis Health's facilities. The plan is reviewed and updated annually. The Security website is an excellent resource for up-to-date security information (http://intranet.UCDMC.ucdavis.edu/safety/security/security_welcome.shtml ). UC Davis Health workforc e can find the Security website by typing \"safety /\" in the ir web browser address bar from the intranet and then click on \"Security\" on the Environmental Health & Safety home page. On the Security home page, UC Davis Health workforce will find links to an o verview of the security program, the UC Davis Police Department website , and the system's Workplace Violence and Hate Incidents site. All telephone lines at the UC Davis Health campus are connected to the UC Davis dispatch center. UC Davis Health workforce can dial 9 -1-1 from any landline on the Sacramento campus and be connected directly to the dispatch center. From a cell phone, call 916 -734-2555. UC Davis Health recommend that UC Davis Health workforce program this number into their cell phone. If UC Dav is Health workforce dial 9-1-1 from a cell phone, the call is received by the California Highway Patrol and may result in a longer response time for assistance. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 40 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Identification Badges and Cardkeys UC Davis Health workforce must wear their photo identificat ion badge at all times. Failure to do so may result in corrective or disciplinary action being taken in accordance with appropriate personnel policies or union contracts. Photo identification badges must be worn so that the photograph, name, working title, and department are clearly visible. No modifications can be made to identification badges unless authorized by the organization. Visitors to the hospital are now required to display a temporary visitor badge at all times . Access into the hospital is cont rolled after 9 p .m.; therefore, employees entering the hospital must show their badge to the Protective Service Officer, or PSO, at the visitor desk. UC Davis Health employee's photo identification badge is attached to a cardkey. The majority of buildings require use of a cardkey to enter the building during non -business hours. Security sensitive areas have enhanced access control in place at all times and require the use of UC Davis Health employee's cardkey. These areas include cash handling areas, Emerg ency Department, infant and pediatric nursing units, research labs, and Pharmacy. Personal Safety UC Davis Health workforce can take several actions to enhance their personal safety. Put personal belongings, such as purse, wallet , or laptop out of sight, p referably in a locked cabinet or drawer when at worksite ; avoid leaving valuables in your vehicle. Be aware of surroundings when walking to and from one's car and use the shuttle service if staff arrive or leave after dark. If possible, walk with others in a group. Avoid wearing headphones and texting when walk ing outdoors. Look ahead for advance warning should someone be acting suspicious and take evasive action, such as crossing the street - have phone preset to dial 911 quickly. Parking and Transportation Services provide a shuttle service to and from outlyi ng parking lots from 5:30 a.m. to midnight on a regular schedule. Protective Service Officers provide a safety escort service from midnight to 5:30 a.m. and 24 hours on weekends and holidays, upon request and when staffing levels and other calls -for-servic e allow. To obtain an after -hours safety escort, call the dispatch center at 916 - 734-2555. The goal of these services is to provide UC Davis Health workforce with an alternative to walking alone on campus after dark. In addition, UC Davis Police Department conducts vehicle, foot , bicycle , and motorcycle patrols of the entire campus, including parking structures and parking lots. Safety Corridor: the \"Safety Corridor\" is the preferred route to walk to the outlying parking lots as the \"Safety Corridor\" has ad ditional lighting and emergency phones along the route. The \"Safety Corridor\" is highlighted in yellow in the map below. Employees are encouraged to avoid walking along Stockton Boulevard or V Street after dark. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 41 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL What Do I Do in an Emergency? Get everyone, including oneself, to safety as quickly as possible. Consider using a Blue Tower or other emergency telephone that provides a direct connection to UCDPD Dispatch when nearby and safer and/or faster to use for reporting the emergency. Call 9 11 via landline or 916 -734-2555 via cell phone and the dispatcher will direct callers to the police. If UC Davis Health workforce cannot stay on the line, if possible, keep a line open to police until they arrive. The more information the police receive, t he more likely they can bring a potentially violent situation to a safe conclusion. Training All new staff, students, and researchers receive security familiarization during orientation sessions and as part of the annual refresher training. In addition, s taff may receive in -service departmental -specific security training, such as for those who handle cash or have direct patient contact. The UC Davis Police Department and Security provides department -specific or hazard -specific security training, upon reque st. Available topics include active -threat defense, personal/professional safety , and conflict resolution. Infant/Child Abduction (Code Rainbow) Code Rainbow is the UC Davis Health designation for suspected infant/child abduction. There are three major co mponents to a successful infant/child abduction prevention program at UC Davis Health: Quick and timely execution of the appropriate response to abduction Education of staff and patients/parents on proper prevention and response procedures UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 42 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Technological se curity measures In the main UC Davis Health hospital facility, call the code line at 4 -3666 to initiate a Code Rainbow. In external UC Davis Health facilities and Primary Care Network Clinics, call 911 to report child abduction. It is the responsibility of all employees to be aware of their department's response to a Code Rainbow. Read UC Davis Health Policy 3304 and review Unit/Department -specific respon ses to a Code Rainbow with one's Manager or resource person. The policy outlines the following prevention/response procedures: In the hospital, immediately dial 4 -3666 to report abduction. The hospital operator will begin announcing overhead \"Code Rainbow and the unit, location, patient sex , and age\" until more information is available. For hospital -based clinics, immediately dial 4 -3666 (Hospital Operator Code Line) and 4 -2555 (UC Davis Police Department) simultaneously. The Hospital Operator will send ou t an Alpha group page for Code Rainbow to include the building name, floor, patient sex , and age. For Primary Care Network Sites, dial 911 to contact local police; as soon as possible, call the UC Davis Health Hospital Operator, who will initiate notificat ion to UC Davis Police and Public Affairs Office . The staff making the call will be expected to provide the following information: unit/department where abduction occurred, name of child on ID bracelet, sex of the child, ethnic background, age of child, description of abductor, last known location of travel , and description of any staff personnel following the abductor. Staff shall attempt to safely follow the abductor. If contact is made, do not physically restrain the abductor but request that the infant /child be released. If the abductor will not release the child, continue to follow until the police arrive or it is impossible to pursue. If threatened or fearful for personal safety, the pursuit should be discontinued. Be prepared to give police a complet e, detailed description of the abductor, the exit used, direction of travel, vehicle , and license number. Immediately secure the patient's room or area where the abduction occurred and prevent all persons in the area at the time of the abduction from leav ing until the police dismiss them. All personnel available in other patient care areas will observe their respective corridors and stairwells for suspicious activity. Notify the police by telephoning 911 if one encounter s a suspicious person. All available Protective Service Officers and Environmental Services Departments will respond to the building exits to assist in locating the child and abductor, until Code Rainbow is discontinued. When given the \"All clear\" by UC Dav is Police, the operator will announce, \"Code Rainbow All Clear\" three times in succession or will initiate the facility procedure for notification . UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 43 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL HUGS - Preventing Infant Abduction UC Davis Health utilizes a state -of-the-art electronic security system, called HUGS, that protects infants and children from the threat of abduction while in the hospital. HUGS create a \"safe area\" where infants/children are monitored at all times . This is where infants/children are supposed to be. The system generates alarms when an infant/child is removed from the safe area, when a tag has been tampered with, when the tag is not seen by the system for a period, or when certain other conditions occur. Refer to UC Davis Health Policy 3302 . Emergency Unlocking of Patient Bathrooms Staff may open locked patient bathrooms in an emergency. Here are examples from the main hospital of several handle configurations, and how to open them (there may be other types in clinics). Submit a PO&M work order if extra override keys are needed. TYPE 1 . Handle with a slot - the slot may be oblong or square. Any obj ect that fits and provides enough leverage to twist the slot will work to unlock the door. Keys work well for this; almost any key will fit the oblong slot and will work. TYPE 2. Handle with knobs - can be turned using a hand. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 44 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL TYPE 3. Square slot hidden behind metal cap. Remove cap with fingers. Then use square override key provided by PO&M (image below) . Put key in slot and turn. square override key cap cap removed to reveal square slot Online Incident Reporting Incident Reporting system, RL Datix , is available for use by all UC Davis Health employees. It may be accessed directly from its icon on any UC Davis Health computer desktop. It may also be accessed via The Insider's On -the-Job Resources. Users may also typ e \"IR/\" in their web browser address bar as a shortcut. The user ID and password correspond to the user's Kerberos account. UC Davis Health Policy 1466 Incident Reports outlines how the IR system is to be used. Any event that is \"...not consistent with the routine Medical Center operations or situations that may potentially or actually result in unanticipated injury, harm or loss to any p atient, visitor, student, volunteer, or employee \" is to be reported. Essentially, anything that occurs outside the normal course of events should be reported. These would include adverse outcomes (e.g. , pressure injuries ), procedural breakdowns (e.g. , brea ch of confidentiality), and catastrophic events (e.g. , wrong site surgery). The Incident Reporting system, RLDatix , has 27 forms within which an IR may be submitted. It is also important to report near misses. Review of near -miss activity may promote syst em changes that will prevent actual adverse outcomes for patients and staff. Use the Employee Event form in RLDatix for reporting only Safe Patient Handling Injury events , needle sticks, and other bloodborne pathogen exposures . Do not use the Incident Repo rting system, RLDatix , to report other employment -related claims . Use the Workers' Compensation system to report employee injuries (see UC Davis Health Policy 2942 Workers' Compensation ). However, UC Davis Health workforce may use the Incident Reporting system, RLDatix , to report the hazards that led to the injury or exposure. Make a note in the IR if there is a Workers' Compensation claim. Questions regarding Incident Reporting system, RLDatix , should be directed to Risk Management at 916-734-3883. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 45 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Reportable Events UC D avis Health is required by state law to report specific adverse outcomes and certain privacy incidents that occur in the hospital to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) no later than five days after the event is detected or, if the adverse ev ent poses an ongoing, urgent , or emergency threat to the welfare, health , or safety of patients, personnel , or visitors, within 24 hours of detection. Failure to do so may result in a fine of $100 per day. Reports to CDPH involving adverse outcomes are mad e by Medical and Regulatory Affairs . Reports involving privacy incidents are made by the Compliance Department and/or the Privacy Officer. For Adverse Outcomes, CDPH is required to conduct an onsite investigation within 48 hours (or two business days) of events that pose an ongoing threat of imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm. The reportable events are described in UC Davis Health Policy 1513 Reporting Serious Adverse Events and Provider -Preventable Conditions . Categories of reportable events, with some examples, include: Surgical events : Surgery performed on the wrong body part, wrong patient, and wrong procedure. Product or device events : Death or serious disability from use of contaminated drug or device. Patient protection events : Infant discharged to the wrong person. Care management events : Death or serious disability associated with a medication error. Environmental events : Death or seri ous disability associated with electric shock. Criminal events : Abduction of a patient of any age. Or, catch all : Any adverse event or series of events that causes the death or serious disability of a patient, staff member, or visitor. Workplace Violence a nd Hate Incidents UC Davis Health is committed to preventing and responding to violence and hate incidents in the workplace through education, adherence to policy , and swift action to threats and acts of violence.

Ways to Prevent Potential Violence in the Workplace Evaluate each situation for potential violence when entering a room or beginning to interact with a patient or visitor. Be vigilant throughout the encounter. Do not isolate yourself with a potentially violent person. Keep an open path for exiting. Do not let the potentially violent person stand between you and the door. Your back should not be turned to the violent person. Try to s tay two or three arm lengths away from the person. Do not ignore concerning behaviors. If possible, have security and/or UCDPD officers present when interacting with a possible aggressive person. Promptly report and document incidents. Ensure employees, students, patients , and visitors are aware of and adhere to the Health System's UC Davis Health Policy 1616 . Utilize the Health System's violence prevention resources including violence prevention classes, in - services, and other support ser vices and departments identified below under resources . UC Davis Health Policy 4067 Prevention and Management of Violence by a Patient or Visitor provides specific procedures for patient care areas. Aggression and violence predicting factors Persons with a history of violent behavior Forensic patients (prisoners) Early release of acute and chronically mentally ill patients Patient refuses psychiatric medi cation or hospitalization Characteristics of aggressive and violent patients and victims Verbally expressed anger and frustration Body language such as threatening gestures Signs of drug or alcohol use Presence of a weapon De-Escalation Techniques - Verbal and physical maneuvers to defuse and avoid violent behavior Respond quietly and calmly. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 49 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Do not take the behavior personally - remain calm and professional. Don't overreact . Demonstrate respect and concern. Consider offering an apology, even if nothing was done wrong. Summarize what the individual is saying and make sure to communicate clearly. Focus on areas of agreement to help resolve the concern. Use the person's name. Listen to the person's concerns and acknowledge the person's feelings. Ask open ques tions. Consider having UC Davis Police and/or security near -by to lessen response time. Assault Cycle There are five phases in the \"assault cycle\". Trigger Phase: Factors that can make people angry and may trigger a violent response include lack of respect, not being listened to, loss of control, sense of injustice, feeling of discrimination, or a lack of competence in others. Break the assault cycle by using de -escalation techniques described above. Escalation Phase: Person experiences physiological \"fight or flight\" response, which includes increased heart rate, tenseness of muscles, blood rushing to head, sweating, and dryness in the mouth. Continue use of de -escalation techniques. Avoid actions that can escalate the situation, such as asking too m any questions, being too rushed, or patronizing the person. Crisis Phase: Both parties are aroused, and assault is imminent or occurring . Reasoning with the person is no longer possible. Manage one's own physiological and physical responses with an emphas is on safety of all involved, such as escape or leave the area, use of barriers, use alarms , or shout to summon help. Recovery Phase: Person is calming down. Be aware of the potential for \"flare up\" and do not attempt an exploration of the incident at this phase. Post -crisis Phase: Person is low in mood, remorseful, guilty, ashamed, or despairing.

On the same day of the incident, document the incident by reporting it online using Incident Reporting system, RLDatix under the categ ory of Safety/Security/Workplace Violence. Weapons on UC Davis Health Property It is a serious violation of the law and against UC Davis Health policy and procedure to possess weapons on UC Davis Health property unless the UC Davis Health workforce is a sw orn peace officer. The California Penal Code makes it a felony to bring or possess the following items on the grounds or within buildings of the University of California: A firearm; or Any dirk (a dagger), ice pick, or knife having a fixed blade longer t han 2 -2\u00bd inches; or. Other items that can inflict great bodily harm, such as BB gun, flare gun, slingshot, or bow/crossbow. Possession includes, but is not limited to, possession of the aforementioned weapons on the person or in a vehicle. Active Shooter/Threat The United States Department of Homeland Security defines the active shooter/threat as \"an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area\"; an indiv idual UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 52 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL who is engaging in behavior that fits this definition typically uses a firearm(s) or other weapon, such as a knife, and there is no pattern or method to their selection of victims. If there is an Active threat in the area, the phrase to remember is RUN, HIDE, and FIGHT . Plan ahead now and look around one's work area to identify an escape route. If RUNNING is not possible, identify one or more places to lock or block the entry in order to HIDE. As a last resort in a life-or-death situation, FIGHT in an attempt to incapacitate the active shooter. If UC Davis Health workforce work with patients and are not in the area affected by the Active threat, identify how to lock or barricade all perimeter doors to HIDE; collectively guide others to safety. Hide out of view, set all noise -making communication devices to silent with no vibration, and turn off the lights. The presence of an Active threat will be announced in plain English. The notification will state, \"Active Shooter (or threat if known). Shooting ( or other described violent action) in Progress. << announce location>>. Lockdown. This is not a drill.\" Depending on the location, the notification will go out via the overhead paging system in the hospital, via text pager in the clinics, or via WarnMe in the other buildings. If UC Davis Health workforce encounter the threat, call 911 when it is safe to do so. If UC Davis Health workforce cannot speak, dial the number and set the phone down. If UC Davis Health workforce is not in immediate danger, answer th e questions to provide the following information: location, number of shooters (or armed threat), physical description, number and type of weapons, and number of victims and hostages, if applicable. When the UC Davis Police or other law enforcement office rs arrive, follow the officers' instructions. Keep one's hands visible at all times. Avoid making quick movements toward officers such as attempting to hold on to them for safety. Avoid pointing, screaming , and/or yelling. The UC Davis Health \"Active Shoot er Response\" ( UC Davis Health Policy 1632 ) describes the expected response in more detail. In addition, a 5 -minute video, called \"Run. Hide. Fight. Surv iving an Active Shooter Event\", was developed by the Department of Homeland Security. The training video is intense and depicts a simulated active shooter event. It is available on YouTube : http://ww w.youtube.com/watch?v=5VcSwejU2D0 A new video, called \"Surviving an Active Shooter in a Healthcare Environment\" addresses active shooter response in a patient care environment.

Detailed information related to the University's policy can be found in UC Davis Policy 400 -20 Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment , the University of California Davis policy , and the UC Office of the President Policy Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment . Sexual harassment includes unwelcome beha vior of a sexual nature when submission to sexual conduct is \"required\" for grades, jobs, medical treatment, or other aspects of University programs (quid pro quo) or when the conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive that it unreasonably denies, adverse ly limits, or interferes with work or learning (hostile work environment) and creates an intimidating or offensive educational or employment environment. The conduct may be verbal, physical, and/or visual (photos, text messages, tweets, or bystander). Prohibited sexual violence includes stalking, relationship violence, and/or sexual assault. Stalking is defined as repeated conduct directed at a person that would cause a reasonable person to fear for their (or others') safety. Relationship violence is defin ed as conduct by a romantic or intimate partner that intentionally or recklessly causes bodily injury to the person or places the person in reasonable fear of serious bodily injury. Sexual assault is defined as any non -consensual sexual contact, including penetration or intimate touching. The policy defines consent as affirmative (yes mean yes), conscious, voluntary, and revocable. If a person is incapacitated (impaired by alcohol or drugs, sleeping, passed out, etc.) to the point where decision making is a ffected, that person cannot be deemed to have consented. Stalking, relationship violence, and sexual assault are not only prohibited by UCD policy, but they are also prohibited by law. In addition to refraining from engaging in the prohibited behavior list ed above, employees may have reporting obligations if they witness sexual harassment/sexual violence or if someone makes them aware of any such behaviors. If a student or patient complains that they have been sexually harassed or experienced any sexual vio lence, all employees (including student employees) are required to report. For concerns regarding sexual harassment or sexual violence experienced by employees , the following are required to report: Campus Police; Human Resource Administrators; Academic Pe rsonnel administrators; managers and supervisors including Deans, Department Chairs, Directors of Organized Research Units , and other academic appointees with managerial responsibilities; and Faculty members. Reports should be made to the Title IX Officer, Wendi Delmendo (530 -752-9466; wjdelmendo@ucdavis.edu ) or to the Harassment & Discrimination Assistance and Prevention Program (HDAPP) at https://hdapp.ucdavis.edu/ or 916-734-3417 . In addition to reporting, responsible employees (anyone required to report as described above) are expected to consult immediately with Title IX/HDAPP and work in conjuncti on with Title IX/HDAPP to address the concerns raised. Responsible employees should not conduct their own investigation into concerns unless directed to do so by Title IX/HDAPP.

Ergonomics, Body Mechanics , and Safe Patient Handling The use of proper body mechanics, ergonomics, and safe patient handling principles assist staff in working safely and efficiently. Positioning the body safely requires awareness of one's posture to decrease injury risk. Using the body safely includes not e xerting beyond one's physical limits. It is an employee 's responsibility to understand their physical limits and to know and use the resources available for assistance. Using the body efficiently requires possessing and maintaining a baseline fitness level necessary to perform tasks in a way that reduces injury probability . Combining fitness, consistent practice of good body mechanics, and the use of training and equipment will overall improve safety culture and increase satisfaction at work. Body Mechanics Physical movement and repetitive motion injuries, combined, were the second highest cause for employee work -related injuries in fiscal year 202 1, per the UC Risk Services Data Management System (RDMS) . Practicing good body mechanics is k nowing how to po sition and use one's body efficiently to adapt to the work environment. The UC Davis Health workforce is encouraged to practice good body mechanics during and outside of employment . Consider these lifting tips: Spread the feet at least shoulder -width apart , if not wider to increase stability and mobility , to acquire a wide base for support. Come close to the load. Loads further from the body increase stress to the back . Place the hands in the optimum position to carry the load. Handles may or may not be in the ideal place. Gr asp the item so the larger arm muscles receive the majority of weight ; therefore, requiring less effort for the small er hand muscles (e.g. , compare hands flat on the sides of a box versus laying a box on the f orearm and grasping the far edge). Test the weight before lifting. Shift, push, or tip the object . Know personal physical limits, and request assistance when needed (e.g., team lift, mechanical assist , etc.) . Direct the body toward the load. Nose and toes should align the same direction to prevent twisting. Take a step or pivot on the balls of the feet when changing direction while carrying a load . UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 56 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Lift upward using the large r hip and leg muscles when rising with a load . Keep feet flat on the floor, back st raight, and , to assist in maintaining a neutral posture, look up or keep the bottom of the chin aligned parallel to the floor. Plan ahead ; identify the final destination, prepare a clear path, and remove barriers. Lower load with control , maintain ing neutr al posture. Remain focused throughout the entire lift. Staff should support and maintain a neutral posture throughout the day. Maintaining physical fitness , proper diet, and a n active lifestyle prevents injuries and provides balance . Staff shall take res ponsibility for maintaining the strength, flexibility, and endurance required to complete their duties . Staff should consider planning breaks accordingly. Physical fitness and wellness can start at work . See the table below for examples of actions to take during breaks: Activity (Relative Long Duration) Break Ideas/Recommendations Standing Prop feet up Monitor Viewing Outdoor Walk Rehydrate Stare at another item approximately 20 feet away for 20 seconds Sitting Stand up & stretch or active exercise Please contact the UC Davis Health Ergonomics Unit at 916 -734-8840 or email hs- requestergonomics@ucdavis.edu if assistance is needed for training . Contact the UC Davis Health Wellness programs ( Living Fit F orever ) or Human Resources ( Work Life Balance ) for additional guidance on physical fitness and wellness . Ergonomic Self -Evaluation The practice of maintaining proper body mechanics and using correct lifting techniques is important in preventing injuries. Body mechanics maintenance includes supporting neutral postures while operating a computer either sitting or standing. Learn how to adjust your workstation monitor, keyboard/mouse, and chair with the Cardinus Healthy Working or Healthy Working @ Home Programs . The course s, \"Healthy Working: Ergonomics \", course code DAHS -ERGO -ECO, and \"Healthy Working @ Home \" for remote workstations, course code DAHS -HWAH , are both located in UC Learning . The self - evaluation questionnaire s are intended to provide staff with education about ergonomic principles and to increase comfort while working . UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 57 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL The self -evaluation should be completed and shared with one's s upervisor to assure appropriate adjustments are made to the workstation. Please contact the UC Davis Health Ergonomics Unit at 916 - 734-8840 or email hs-requestergonomics@ucdavis.edu whe n additional assistance is needed . Contact the Disability Management Services to request a reasonable accommodation . Safe Patient Handling Every year, thousands of hospital workers are injured while performing patient handling tasks. Cal /OSHA requires hospitals in California to create and maintain a plan to protect health care workers from back and musculoskeletal injuries while also protecting patients. This plan must include a safe patient handling policy to use a powered patient transf er device, lifting device, friction reducing device, or a lift team, as appropriate, rather than lifting and/or transferring a patient manually. Safe Patient Handling applies to all patient care units that are part of a general acute care hospital in Calif ornia. The regulation identifies four types of patient handling: To lift is to move a patient's body vertically or support part or all of the patient's body. To mobilize is to put or assist in putting into motion part or all of a patient's body. To reposi tion is to change a patient's position on a bed, gurney, chair, or other support surface. To transfer is to move a patient from one surface to another, such as from a bed to a gurney. Several types of equipment are available to assist with various patient handling tasks. Patient -lifts help the most immobile patients, with slings sized small to XXL (90 -1,000 lbs.). UC Davis Health has portable lifts, with varying weight capacities (350 -1,000 lbs.). These lifts come with special features, which include but ar e not limited to, the ability to assist a patient from their vehicle, or to assist with standing and/or walking. Additional devices available include the Hover Matt system, Prevalon Turn & Position, and Sally Tube reduced -friction transfer sheet. All are d esigned for single patient use (allowing repeated use for the same patient during their hospital stay) and have both a standard and bariatric version. Innovative technology is driving this emerging group of products . UC Davis Health is committed to evaluat ing new products prior to integration into the safe patient handling program. Selection of the appropriate patient handling methods and equipment shall be determined by the health care provider that has received the annual compliance hands -on training, registered nurse (RN) in conjunction with the Lift Team , and/or licensed personnel prior to the patient movement. The health care provider or RN shall be responsible for the observation and direction of patient lifts or mobilization and shall participate as needed in patient handling in accordance with their job description and use of the Banner Mobility Assessm ent Tool (BMAT) * (*BMAT is utilized for the inpatient setting only) . UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 58 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Safe Patient Handling Resources Safe Patient Handling information, including the Banner Mobility Assessment Tool (BMAT) and additional resources are located on the Lift Team webpage located at: http://intranet.UCDMC .ucdavis.edu/pcs/liftteam/index.shtml . Review UC Davis Health Policy 4004 Safe Patient Handling . Patient Safety Patie nt Rights The staff and medical staff at UC Davis Health shall observe the rights and responsibilities of patients and/or the authorized representative responsible for making medical decisions on behalf of the patient. A notice summarizing patient rights and responsibilities shall be distributed to the patient and/or their authorized representative upon admission or as soon thereafter as reasonably practicable via the \"New Patient Welcome Brochure.\" A list of patient rights will be appropriately posted wit hin UC Davis Health facilities in English and in Spanish and include short statements (taglines) written in the top 15 languages spoken in California that indicate the availability of language assistance services free of charge. The \"Speak Up\" initiative i s a campaign launched by The Joint Commission, together with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to encourage patients' active involvement in their own care as a patient safety strategy. Information about the \"Speak Up\" initiative is included i n the \"New Patient Welcome Brochure\" and is available upon request in Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, Hmong , and Russian. An example of the \"Speak Up\" information is located in UCDH Policy 1 402, a ttachment 7 . All patients will be provided a copy of the UC Davis Health Notice of Privacy Practices. For additional information on patient rights, refer to UC Davis Health Policy 1402 . Homeless Patient Discharge Policy Purp ose of the policy: The policy's purpose is to help prepare patients who are experiencing homelessness for return to the community by connecting them with available community resources, treatment, shelter , and other supportive services. A \"homeless patient\" is defined in state law as an individual who: Lacks a fixed and regular nighttime residence, or UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 59 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Has a primary nighttime residence that is a supervised publicly - or privately -operated shelter designed to provide temporary living accommodations, or Is residing in a public or private place that was not designed to provide temporary living accommodations or to be used as a sleeping accommodation for human beings. Which hospitals must comply? The homeless patient discharge law applies to general acute care hospitals (like UC Davis Medical Center) , acute psychiatric hospitals , and special hospitals. When does the law take effect? Most provisions of the homeless discharge planning law took effect on January 1, 2019, and the requirement s to have a written plan to coordinate with community partners and maintain a homeless patient log took effect July 1, 2019. Which patients are covered? This policy applies to hospital inpatients and emergency department patients, but not to patients with an outpatient clinic or physician office visit. The homeless patient discharge planning law must be followed whenever a hospital discharges a ny homeless patient, unless they are transferred to another licensed health facility, such as a hospital, skilled nur sing facility, intermediate care facility, licensed board and care facility, psychiatric facility, etc. What is required? Ask about housing status: hospitals must inquire about a patient's housing status during the discharge plan ning process. Cultural competency: the policy must require that information about discharge or transfer be provided to all patients experiencing homelessness in a culturally competent manner and in a language that they understand. Nondiscrimination: housing status must not be used to discriminate against a patient or prevent medically necessary care or hospital admission. Individual discharge plan: the hospital homeless discharge planning policy must require an individual discharge plan for patients who are experiencing homelessness that helps prepare the patient for return to the community by connecting them with available community resources, treatment, shelter, and other supportive services. The homeless discharge plan must be guided by the best interest of the patient , their physical and mental condition, and the patient's preference for placement. Patients experiencing homelessness must be informed of available placement options. Unless the patient who is experiencing homelessness is being transferred to another licen sed facility, the policy requires the hospital to identify a post -discharge destination for the homeless UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 60 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL patient as follows, with priority given to identifying a sheltered destination with supportive services: A social services agency, nonprofit social services provider, or governmental service provider that has agreed to accept the patient, if they are agreeable to the placement. The hospital shall provide potential receiving agencies or providers written or electronic information about the patient's know n post -hospital health and behavioral health care needs and shall document the name of the person at the agency or provider who agreed to accept the homeless patient. The patient's residence . In the case of a patient who is experiencing homelessness, \"residence\" for the purposes of this subparagraph means the location identified to the hospital by the patient as their principal dwelling place. An alternative destination, as indicated by the patient. The hospital shall document the destination indicated by the patient or their representative. The hospital shall document all of the following prior to discharging patients who are experiencing homelessness: Medical screening and evaluation: the tre ating physician shall provide a medical screening examination and evaluation to determine the patient's clinical stability for discharge, including, but not limited to, an assessment as to whether the patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and tim e, and the physician or designees has communicated post -discharge medical needs to the patient. Follow -up care: if medically necessary, the patient has been referred to a source for follow -up care. Prescriptions: the law requires that the homeless patient be provided with a prescription(s), if needed. If the hospital has an onsite pharmacy licensed and staffed to dispense outpatient medication, an appropriate supply of all necessary medication, if available, must be provided to the patient \u2014 that is, the ac tual medication(s), not just a written prescription(s). In addition, each patient must receive discharge medication counseling. Infectious disease screening: the hospital must do one of the following: 1) Offer the homeless patient screening for infectious disease common to the region, as determined by the local health department; or 2) Refer the patient to another location (perhaps a county clinic) for such screening. Vaccinations: homeless patients must be offered vaccinations appropriate to their presenti ng medical condition. The treating physician should try to determine the patient's vaccination status and which vaccination(s) are appropriate to the patient's presenting medical condition. The treating physician has provided a medical screening examinatio n and evaluation. If the treating physician determines that the results of the medical screening examination and evaluation indicate that follow -up behavioral health care is needed, the patient shall be treated or referred to an appropriate provider. The hospital shall make a good faith effort to contact one of the following, if applicable: i. The homeless patient's health plan, if the homeless patient is enrolled in a health plan. ii. The homeless patient's primary care provider, if the patient has identified one. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 61 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL iii. Another appropriate provider, including, but not limited to, the coordinated entry system. Patients who are experiencing homelessness must be screened for, and provided assistance to enroll in, any affordable health insuran ce coverage for which they are eligible. Transportation: the hospital must offer the homeless patient transportation to their post - discharge destination, if that destination is within 30 minutes or 30 miles of the hospital. The hospital may offer transport ation to a more distant destination if it wishes to do so but is not required to. The patient may refuse offered transportation. A hospital shall develop a written plan for coordinating services and referrals for patients who are experiencing homelessness with the county behavioral health agency, health care , and social services agencies in the region, health care providers, and nonprofit social services providers, as available, to assist with ensuring appropriate patient discharge. The plan shall be update d annually and shall include all of the following: A list of local homeless shelters, including their hours of operation, admission procedures and requirements, client population served, and general scope of medical and behavioral health services available . The hospital's procedures for homeless patient discharge referrals to shelter, medical care, and behavioral health care. The contact information for the homeless shelter's intake coordinator. Training protocols for discharge planning staff. Each hospital shall maintain a log of all patient's identified as homeless discharged and the destinations to which they were released after discharge. The hospital shall maintain evidence of completion of the homeless patient discharge protocol in the log or in the patient's medical record. Legislation: https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB1152 California Hospital Policy 4089 Discharge Plan Ligature Risk and Self -Harm General Acute Care Hospitals and non -behavioral health units DESIGNATED for the treatment of psychiatric patients (i.e. , Emergency Departments or Medical Units) a re required to establish and maintain a safe, functional environment. The Joint Commission \"Environment of Care\" Standard , EC 02.06 .01, states \"Interior spaces meet the needs of the patient population and are safe and suitable to the care, treatment, and services provided .\" Therefore, ligature and self -harm risks must be identified UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 62 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL and eliminated when possible . Policies and procedures must be de veloped by healthcare facilities and implemented to mitigate the harm posed by such risks. Mitigation plans must include, at a minimum, the following: Ensuring that leadership and staff are aware of the current environmental risks ; Identifying patients' r isk for suicide or self -harm, then implement ing appropriate interventions based upon ris k; Assessing and re -assessing at-risk behavior as defined by the organization ; Ensuring the training of staff to properly identify patients' level of risk and implement appropriate interventions ; Incorporating suicide risk and self -harm reduction strategies into the overall Quality Assessment/Performance Improvement (QAPI) program ; If equipment poses a risk but is necessary for the safe treatment of psychiatric patients (i.e., medical beds with side rails on a geriatric unit), the organization must consider these risks in patients ' overall suicide/self -harm risk assessments, then implement appropriate interventions to diminish those risks . All physical risks not required for the treatment of the patient that can be removed, must be removed. Furthermore, an appropriate level of effective surveillance must be implemented if self -harm risks remain in the environment. Organizational policies and procedures must adequa tely guide staff in the assessment of patients' risk for suicide/self -harm and the implementation of interventions based upon the patients' individual needs. UC Davis Health has implemented tools, policy, and protocols to support the maintenance of a safe and functional environment for our patients. Review the following policy and attachments: UC Davis Health policy 4016 Identification and Management of Patients at Risk for Suicide UC Davis Health Policy 4016 (Attachment 4) Environment Patient Safety Sweep UC Davis Health Policy 4016 (Attachment 3) Suicide and Ligature Prevention Workflows Patient Identification (Excerpts from UC Davis Health Polic y 2702 ) It is the policy of UC Davis Health to ensure that all patients are properly identified prior to any care, treatment , or services provided. In the hospital setting, every patient shall always have a tamper -proof non -transferable ID band applied securely to at least one extremity . Exceptions: Small infants and patients with a disease process, injury, or treatment that prevents safe placement of the ID band on any extremity. The band shall include the patient's first and last name, medical record number, date of birth , gender , and a linear bar code . UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 63 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Before any procedure is carried out, the identification band shall be on the patient and will be checked for the following two identifiers to ensure that the correct patient is involved: Patient name Patient medical record number Staff shall verbally assess the patient to assure proper identification, asking the patient's name and date of birth and matching the verbal confirmation to the written information on the identification band. Staff will identify the individual patient as the person for whom the service or treatment is intended and match the service or treatment to that individual patient. No procedure sh all be conducted when the patient's identity cannot be verified because the imprinted band is illegible or missing. Patient identification must be confirmed using the two -identifier system prior to conducting any healthcare procedures. Note: In outpatient settings where the patient is not required to wear an ID band, the two identifiers used to confirm patient identity are the patient's name and date of birth. Informed Consent In all non -emergency circumstances, physicians or other authorized healthcare pr oviders must obtain verbal and written permission (\"informed consent\") of their patients to perform surgical, diagnostic , or therapeutic procedures (including blood , or blood product , transfusion and administration of anesthetics) that are considered \"complex\", where consent is required by law, or if the procedure inherently involves a known risk of serious injury, disability , or death. The patient must be fully informed about the treatment - including the treatment itself, the risks , benefits, and side effects - and the alternatives (and the risks, benefits, and side effects of the alternatives) . The patient must know they have the right to accept or refuse the treatment or service , and the forese eable risk or consequences of such a refusal . For additional information on Informed Consent, refer to UC Davis Health Policy 1411 Consent to Operation, Procedures, Blood Transfusion and A dministration of Anesthetics . Patient Advance Directives for Healthcare An Advance Health Care Directive is an instruction stating an individual's preferences regarding medical treatment options and/or designating who sh ould make treatment choices should the individual lose their decision -making capacity . In California, these include a Power of Attorney for Health Care and individual health care instructions (oral or written). All hospital inpatients (adults and emancipat ed minors) must be asked if they would like to receive written information about Advanced Directives. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 64 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL There is now an Advance Care Planning activity in Epic EHR to record and track this type of information. Click on \"ACP Documents\" or \"HCA\" in the Storybo ard to go there. Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment, or POLST, documents can be created and managed in this activity as well.

UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 66 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL SPOT A STROKE. SAVE A LIFE: Acting fast is critical ! Care of LVAD Patients at UC Davis UCDMC has an active and growing LVAD program. VAD patients can be seen throughout the hospital and in clinics. What is an LVAD? An LVAD is an implanted continuous -flow heart pump implanted during open heart surgery. The LVAD takes blood from the failing left ventricle and moves it to the aorta to circulate throughout the body. All LVADs contain a Driveline that exits the abdomen and connects to a controller to run the pump and batteries or an AC cable to power it. Who gets an LVAD? Patients with advanced heart failure that have failed medical management are considered for advanced therapies. Heart Transplant remains the standard of care for tho se eligible and able to await transplant. For patients unable to await transplant an LVAD can be placed as a \"Bridge to Transplant\". For patient's ineligible for transplant an LVAD can be placed as \"Destination Therapy\". If transplant criteria are later met the patient can be evaluated and changed to a \"bridge to transplant\" VAD patient. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 67 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL VAD equipment the patient will have. VAD patients ' driveline will be attached to a controller and the controller will be attached to 2 power sources, either batteries or wall power. All patients should also have a backup bag containing a backup controller and backup batteries. Where will VAD patients be admitted in the hospital? ED, CTICU, MSICU Blue, E6, and E5 will you encounter LVAD patients? They wil l be seen in VAD clinic and cardiology clinic. They will also be seen for procedures around the hospital: X -ray, Ultrasound, CT Scan, GI lab, Pre -OP, Post -Op, Cath Lab, EP Lab . What do you do in case of a VAD patient emergency? Call the LVAD team. The VAD pager is 916-816-7363 . The ager is covered 24/7 by a VAD Coordinator . Respiratory Arrest : In the event of a respiratory arrest, rescue breathing should be initiated using the American Heart Association Guidelines . 10 breaths per minute or one breath every 6 seconds . Cardiac Arrest : If external defibrillation is necessary, leave the pump running . Do not disconnect the system controller from the percutaneous lead before delivering the shock. VAD patients o ften do not have a pulse but they should have an organized heart rhythm . If indicated , CPR can be performed on LVAD patients . See the protocol on treating an unresponsive LVAD patient below . UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 68 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL VAD Code Blue : In the event of a VAD code blue in the hospital, dial 4 -3666. Inform the operator that it is a \"VAD Code Blue\". The operator will page the VAD team. In the event of a VAD code blue outside the hospital, call 911 and page the VAD team at 916 - 816-7363. For more information, refer to the following VAD poli cies: 5002 Durable Ventricular Assist Device Transport HeartWare Restraints Review Provide nursin g care and documentation for patients requiring restraints according to the restraint policy and procedure. Refer to UC Davis Health Policies 4069 Restraints and 4070 Use of Protocol UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 69 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Restraints for Specific Patient Conditions . Staff is required to be familiar with current policy and to follow policy in providing patient care. Take this time to follow the links provided and read through the current policy related to restraints. What is a restr aint? A physical restraint is any manual method or physical or mechanical device, material , or equipment that immobilizes or reduces the ability of a patient to move their arms, legs, body, or head freely; a drug or medication when it is used as a restriction to manage the patient's behavior or restrict the patient's freedom of movement and is not a standard treatment dosage for the patient's condition. Four (4) Side Rails is considered a restraint when the intent of use is to restrict patient movement or immobilize or reduce the patient 's ability to move freely (e.g. , if a patient is physically able to ambulate, even if it has been determined that they cannot safely ambulat e and the 4 side rails prevent this, then the 4 side rails must be defined as a restraint). Conversely, if a patient is not physically able to get out of bed regardless of whether the side rails are raised or not, raising all four side rails for this patie nt would not be considered restraint because the side rails have no impact on the patient's freedom of movement. In this example, the use of all four side rails would not be considered restraint. Other examples: When a patient is on a bed that constantly m oves to improve circulation or prevent skin breakdown, raised side rails are a safety intervention to prevent the patient from falling out of bed and are not viewed as restraint. When a patient is placed on seizure precautions and all side rails are raised , the use of side rails would not be considered restraint. The use of padded side rails in this situation should protect the patient from harm; including falling out of bed should the patient have a seizure. Exclusions: Standard practices that include lim itation of mobility or temporary immobilization for medical, dental, diagnostic, or surgical procedures, including post -procedure care. For example, the standards do not apply to surgical positioning, intravenous arm boards, radiotherapy procedures, or pro tection of surgical and treatment sites in pediatric patients. Adaptive support used in response to a patient's assessed need. For example, the standards do not apply to postural support, orthopedic appliances, or tabletop chairs. Protective equipment, s uch as helmets. Forensic restrictions and restrictions imposed by corrections and law enforcement authorities for security purposes. Age or developmentally appropriate protective safety interventions (such as stroller safety belts, swing safety belts, highchair lap belts, raised crib rails, and crib covers) that a safety -conscious childcare provider outside a healthcare setting would utilize to protect an infant, toddler, or preschool -aged child would not be considered restraint or seclusion. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 70 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Clinical Just ification for the Use of Restraints Violent and self -destructive behavior, harmful to self, others, and the environment such as hitting, hair pulling, throwing objects, striking at or biting staff or others, and self -mutilation. Behavior interfering with lifesaving and/or necessary medical treatment such as pulling, tugging, grabbing at lines or tubes, picking at open wound, dressings, drains, and traction. Behavior indicating patient is unable to follow directions to avoid self -injury, such as sitting at the edge of the bed, transferring in/out of bed, standing or ambulating, without the strength or cognition function of doing so safely. The use of restraint is not based on a patient's history of restraint or dangerous behavior. A request from a family memb er for restraint, which they consider as beneficial, is not a sufficient basis for the use of restraints. Use of alternative measures has proven ineffective. The least restrictive method must be considered when using restraints. Refer to Policy 4069, Attachment 5 Least to Most Restrictive Reference Chart for assistance in selecting the most appropriate and least restrictive method or product to meet the needs of the patients. Levels of Restraints A Non -violent Restraint is the use of soft restraints, Posey belts, bed enclosures, and other forms of restraints to protect a child or adult who is confused, disoriented, unable to call for assistance, or unable to follow instruction for their personal safety; or from dislodging a medical device; or from interfering with the integrity of a dressing or wound. A Violent Restraint is the use of a physical or mechanical device to involuntarily re strain the movement of all or a portion of a patient's body as a means of controlling violent or assaultive behavior with the intent to prevent patient from harming self or others. Restraint Orders/Nursing Care The healthcare team shall assess the need for use of restraints. This assessment should include: a physical assessment to identify medical problems that may be causing behavior changes, e.g. , hypoxia, hypoglycemia, e lectrolyte imbalances, etc., and a lternative interventions that might prevent the ne ed for restraints. The RN may initiate the use of restraints upon receipt of a verbal, telephone or electronic restraint order from a provider ( MD/DO/NP/PA ). For non -violent restraint use, i f a provider is not available to issue such an order, the RN initi ates restraint use based on an appropriate assessment of the patient, notifies the provider within 12 hours of the initiation of restraint and obtains an order. The order must be reordered every 24 hours after a face -to-face reassessment of the patient wit h determination of continued need. An exception to this is patients who meet the criteria for protocol restraints for specific conditions or certain specific clinical procedures. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 71 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL The provider must be notified immediately and conduct a face -to-face evaluation and enter order within one hour upon initiation of restraint for the management of violent or self -destructive behavior that jeopardizes the physical safety of the patient, staff, or others. PRN (as needed) orders are prohibited. Protocol for Use of Treatment Restraints for Specific Patient Conditions A provider must issue a patient specific order authorizing the use of restraints. RNs may apply restraints under a protocol with an MD/DO/NP/PA order for specific condit ions or certain spe cific clinical procedures (e.g. , post -traumatic brain injury, insertion of intra -aortic balloon pump) to prevent significant harm to the patient (see UC Davis Health Policy 4070 Use of Protocol Restraints for Specific Patient Conditions ). In this situation, RNs maintain and terminate restraint in accordance with established criteria defined in the protocol. Patient Safety in R estraints The RN is responsible for using appropriate restraints, based on the provider order, and for assessing, monitoring and re -evaluating the patient and restraints. Monitoring and Assessing Patients in Restraints The RN and provider can monitor pati ents in restraint. PT, OT, Speech Therapist, Psycho -Social Vocational Service Provider, Emergency Department Technicians, and Radiology Technologists operate under the direction of the current order and continue to monitor and document when the patient is under their sole supervision. Assessment will include but is not limited to the following: Type of restraint Clinical justification Restraints appropriately applied, removed, or reapplied Whether less restrictive methods are possible Vital signs Respirat ory status Circulation, movement, and sensation Skin integrity Mentation/Behavior/Cognitive Function/Level of distress and agitation Bathroom needs Fluids/Nourishment needs Releasing the restraints to check for injury Range of motion performed Patient's re adiness for release from restraints Call light within reach UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 72 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Patient dignity and rights maintained Discontinuing Restraint Use The provider and RN have the authority to discontinue the use of restraint. Restraints will be discontinued as soon as is safely possible even if there is still time left on the order when: Improved mental status Patient's agreement and compliance with instructions for safety Improved ability to sit at edge of bed, transfer or ambulate without risk or injury Less restrictive measures are effective Patient's lines are discontinued or no longer required for medical treatment The need for restraints does not exist, such as discontinuation of medical treatments The order has expired When restraints are terminated early and the pa tient subsequently exhibits the same behavior that initially required the restraints, a new order is required [CMS 482.13(e ) (1) (i) (C) A-0161]. Note: A temporary, directly supervised release, however, that occurs for the purpose of caring for a patient's need is not considered a discontinuation of the restraint. If the patient remains under direct staff supervision, the restraint is not considered to be discontinued because the staff member is present and is serving the same purpose as the restraint. Risks of Restraint Use Risks associated with restraint use should be taken into consideration when assessing the need for restraint and determining the monitoring and care needed while restraints are in place. These risks include: Patients with cognitive impa irment may attempt self -removal, increasing risk of injury. Patients may not be able to communicate needs while in restraints. Patients in vest/belt restraints may be injured by falling through split side rails. Patients in vest/belt restraints may experie nce respiratory compromise. Patients in restraints may exhibit increased agitation. Patients may experience psychological distress due to restraints. Patients may experience circulatory compromise of restrained extremity. Elder or Dependent Adult Abuse Refer to UC Davis Health Policy 1531 Reporting Suspected Elder or Dependent Adult Abuse or Neglect for complete text of current policy. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 73 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL How to Detect, Ho w to Intervene Researchers estimate that nearly two million elderly people are abused each year in the United States. As the population becomes older and sicker, the problem is expected to worsen. To intervene effectively, UC Davis Health workforce needs to recognize the symptoms of elder abuse. Additionally, UC Davis Health workforces are legally required to report to the authorities all suspected cases of elder abuse. Detecting Abuse Elder abuse is generally categorized under one of four headings: physica l, psychological, financial, or neglect. It is not unusual for several types of abuse to occur simultaneously. Physical Abuse is defined as the infliction of physical harm or injuries, including sexual abuse or misconduct. Physical abuse commonly takes the form of hitting, slapping, pushing, punching, pinching, burning, or striking with objects. An abused older adult may be loyal or fearful of the abuser or ashamed to acknowledge dependency on the abuser, thus they are not willing to report physical abuse. Classic signs include: Wounds inconsistent with explana tion of how the injury occurred Bruis es at several stages of healing Delay in seeking treatment Suspicious behavio r by family member or caregiver Psychological Abuse is defined as inflicting emotional pain or distress on the victim. It usually occurs with physical abuse, but it can also occur alone. It may be difficult to detect psychological abuse unless physically present to witness such overt examples as threats, insults , or humiliation. A red flag should be raised when: The elderly patient's caregiver seems indifferen t or angry toward them . The patient is withdrawn, isolated, depressed, demoralized , or fearful toward their caregiver. Financial Abuse is defined as when a family member, caregiver , or friend takes control of the elder's resources either through misrepres entation, coercion, or theft. The victim of this type of abuse may or may not realize what is happening. A red flag should be raised when: The patient mentions they lack money for food, household supplies, and/or prescription drugs. The patient's nutrition al status is poor. The patient mentions they are no longer allowed by their caregiver to live in their home. Elder Neglect is a blanket term used to describe situations in which the well -being of the older adult is judged to be at risk due to lack of atte ntion to themself or their living environment. Neglectful behaviors UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 74 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL range from failure to meet nutritional and hygienic needs to suicide or manslaughter. Elder neglect may occur when: The care needed exceeds the caregiver's ability to deliver. The caregive r is ignorant. The patient no longer can care for themself due to declining capacity. Risk Factors for Elder or Dependent Adult Abuse Condition Victim Abuser History of mental illness X X Shared living arrangements X X Family history of violence X X Isolation X Stressful events X Poor health X Cognitive impairment X Substance abuse X Dependency X X Lack of financial resources X X How to Report Elder or Dependent Adult Abuse Telephone the Department of Clinical Social Services immediately ( 916-734-2583) or after hours page the Crisis Services social worker ( 916-816-5585) to notify them of the patient's name and location. Telephone the appropriate agency as soon as possible to notify them of the suspected abuse and that the report form will follow. If the elder or dependent adult lives in the community and outside a long -term care facility, contact Adult Protective Services (in Sacramento County , 916-874-9377) or local law enforcement agencies. If the elder or dependent a dult lives in a long -term care facility, contact the Ombudsman Program (in Sacramento County , 916-448-3494) or local enforcement agencies. Complete the Elder and Dependent Adult Abuse Reporting Form (SOC 341) promptly.

For infants and children evaluated in the Emergency Department or P ediatric Inpatient Units who have injuries concerning for child abuse, a formal child abuse consultation can be obtained by paging the Child Protection Team at 916-451-5011. If you are concerned that the patient's proxy has , or might get , access to the patient's notes via MyUCDavisHealth , you may block release of these notes IF, in your professional judgment sharing these notes might lead to physical harm to the patient. Document the reason for note blocking by selecting a reason from the pop-up window after clicking the \"Don't Share with Patient\" button. You could include this in a secondary non -shared note, while leaving less sensitive information in the main, shared note . Blood Product Administration and Transfusion Reaction Refer to UC Davis Health Policy 13012 Administration of Blood and Blood Components for complete text of current policy . Licensed Personnel Responsibilities Prepar ing for Blood Product Transfusion Verify MD transfusion order and identify availability of blood products . UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 76 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Verify a current, signed consent for blood. At minimum, the elements of consent shall include a description of the risks, benefits, and treatment alt ernatives (including non -treatment); the opportunity to ask questions; and the right to accept or refuse transfusion. Informed consent for blood administration covers all blood administration for a hospital admission. Outpatient infusion areas for adults and children, informed consent for blood administration is valid for one year with chronic conditions, and throughout the patient's course of treatment for transient conditions lasting less than one year. Patient Education Provide pa tient/family education related to transfusion of blood products. For outpatient, elective transfusions the current version of the California Department of Public Health brochure \"A Patient's Guide to Blood Transfusion \" must be provided. A physician, RN, CRNA , or perfusionist m ust explain the procedure to the patient, patient's family , or to the patient's lawfully authorized representative. Obtaining Specimen for Type & Cross/Type & Screen Two patient identifiers must be used to confirm identity prior to any specimen collection or transfusion. Appropriate identifiers are: name, MRN, date of birth , and/or SSN. EMR Lab label must have date, time, and first and last name of person drawing the blood . If any correctio ns need to be made to the automatic, computer -generated label that is printed, a single line should be made through the printed information and any corrections can be made by handwriting the correct information. Any hand -written information should be made in block letter s. For the specimen collector, a minimum of first initial and full last name should be provided. All specimens must be labeled at the bedside in the presence of the patient for Blood Bank testing. If requested by the lab, draw a specimen for ABO /Rh verification (ABDV) . This specimen must be collected by someone other than the person who drew the original blood specimen and must be collected at least five minutes before or after the Type and Screen specimen . Transporting Blood Outside the Lab Maintain the blood at an even temperature. DO NOT set blood on a tray with or carry blood close to hot or cold packs, drinks, or other materials. Protect blood from sharp objects. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 77 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Administering Blood Products Blood product availability is reflected in EMR under the associated blood product crossmatch order or by looking under Lab Results Review Blood Bank Products. When blood product is available for issue, the following unit statuses will be reflected in EMR: \"Crossmatch\" or \"XM\" status \"Incompatible Crossmatch\" or \"IX\" status (in rare cases where all units serologically tested showed reactivity and the least incompatible unit was selected by blood bank for transfusion) RN or designee will bri ng a demographic label to pick up blood product for the patient. The demographic label must contain two patient identifiers. Appropriate identifiers are: name, medical record number (MRN of birth, and/or social SSN). At blood issue /dispe nsing , the information shall be verified: Intended recipient's two independent identifiers, ABO group, and Rh type Donation identification number, the donor ABO group, and the donor Rh type Interpretation of the crossmatch tests, if perform ed Special transfusion requirements, if applicable Unit has not expired After issue and immediately before transfusion, the following information shall be verified by a two person check in the presence of the patient. One person shall be the licensed tran sfusionist (person who will be administering the blood product). The intended recipient's two independent identifiers, ABO group, and Rh type The donation identification number, the donor ABO group, and the Rh type The interpretation of crossmatch tests, if performed (see below for more information) Special transfusion requirements, if applicable (example: CMV, IRR) The unit has not expired. Interpretation of Crossmatch Tests A crossmatch is performed to ensure the patient and the donor are compatible. T he interpretation is located on the Unit Crossmatch and Transfusion Record tag attached to the unit as well as on the Unit Crossmatch and Transfusion Record sticker adhered to the unit. Crossmatch Interp : Y means \"Yes\" or Compatible. Crossmatch Interp: N means \"No\" or Incompatible. See Unit Crossmatch and Transfusion Record tag snapshots below for location of this documentation. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 78 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL For patients with Crossmatch Interp Y, no further action is required. U nit is crossmatch compatible and okay to transfuse. See EMR snapshot below. For patients with Crossmatch Interp N, verify in EMR that least incompatible blood has been approved by the blood bank. If this cannot be verified in EMR, contact blood bank. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 79 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL To verify that least incompatible blood has been approved by blood bank, review the blood product order and associated crossmatch comment that states: \"All units crossmatched to this patient show reactivity. This unit tested as least incompatible and approve d for transfusion by blood bank.\" See EMR snapshot below. Initiation of Transfusion and Monitoring of Patient Obtain baseline vital signs (temperature, pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and SpO2) immediately prior to the transfusion. Initiate th e transfusion slowly (< 30 ml in the first 15 minutes). Remain with the patient for the first 15 minutes after blood enters the vein, observing for adverse event. Observe the patient at least every 30 minutes during the transfusion and at least 30 minute s after the transfusion. Repeat vital sign measurement at 15 min, 30 min, and at the end of the transfusion. Document the transfusion in the transfusion record per patient care area workflow . By state and federal laws, the record must contain: Nursing transfusion order Documentation of patient consent The name of the component (i.e. , red blood cells, platelets, etc.) The donation identification number The date/time of transfusion start/stop Pre- and post -transfusion vital signs The amount transfused The identification of the licensed transfusionist If applicable, the use of blood warmer (ID of the warmer and the pre -and post -transfusion temperature of warmer) UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 80 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL If applicable, transfusion -related adverse events Used blood bags must be kept for at least 6 hours post transfusion in the event of a subacute transfusion reaction and need for further testing/evaluation of the product. Recognizing Transfusion Reactions Any change in a patient's condition while blood is being administered should be con sidered a possible reaction to the transfusion. Acute reactions occur immediately, subacute reactions occur within 6 hours , and delayed reactions occur up to several months after the completion of the transfusion. Signs and symptoms of ACUTE reactions in clude: Fevers (increased temperature of > 1 degree C during or immediately following transfusion) Chills Itching or urticaria (hives) Pain (flank pain, IV site pain, chest pain, or other sites) Sudden onset of dyspnea, drop in SpO2, or sensation /complaint of difficulty breathing Hypotension (sudden drop of blood pressure > 40 mm Hg) Hypertension (sudden increase in blood pressure > 40 mm Hg) Hemoglobinuria Complaint of a sense of impending doom Sudden decrease in urine output Unexplained bleeding or oozing from puncture or incision sites Chest pain Pulmonary edema Shock Altered mental status Signs and symptoms of DELAYED reactions include: Unexplained onset of jaundice Unexpected decrease or failed increase in hemoglobin occurring 5 -13 days after transfusion Unexpected elevation in liver function tests Sudden and unexplained rash or diarrhea 6 -10 days after transfusion Sudden drop in platelet count 5 -10 days after transfusion At First Sign of an Adverse Reaction: Stop the transfusion immediately. Keep IV open with normal saline infusion ; use a new administration set . Check patient identification and donor unit match to confirm patient is receiving correct unit. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 81 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Notify physician immediately. Notify Transfusion Service STAT and describe symptoms. At Transfusion Service's request, send properly labeled post -transfusion samples ASAP. Send the remaining unit or empty blood bags, the Y -filter administration set and clamped IV fluids to Transfusion Service for follow -up as described UC Davis Health Policy 13012 Administration of Blood and Blood Components . Physician or nurse to complete the Transfusion Reaction Investigation form and return to Transfusion Service ASAP. Do this STAT if patient requires additional transfusions. See policy for specific p ediatric and neonatal requirements . Blood Supply Shortages The national donor blood supply is volatile and shortages occur. The institution's respo nse to a blood product shortage is a scaled response based on the number of operational days of in -house inventory available for each product line (red blood cells, plasma, platelets, and cryoprecipitate). The response plan, developed by multidisciplinary leadership, is housed on the UCDH Continuity of Operations Page (UC Davis Health Continuity of Operations Plan ) as well as notated within the blood bank internal disaster response Standard Operating Procedure . Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative The Baby Friendly Hospital Initia tive (BFHI) focuses on protecting, promoting , and supporting breastfeeding in facilities providing maternity and newborn services. It is critical that the BFHI program is integrated with all other aspects of breastfeeding protection, promotion , and support. The core purpose of the BFHI is to ensure that mothers and newborns receive timely and appropriate care before and during their stay in a facility providing maternity and newborn services, to enable the establishment of optimal feeding of new borns, which promotes their health and development. UC Davis Health staff will actively support breastfeeding as the preferred method of providing nutrition to infants. A multidisciplinary, culturally appropriate team comprising physicians, nursing staff, lactation consultants, nutrition staff, and other appropriate staff shall be established and maintained to identify and eliminate institutional barriers to breastfeeding. On a yearly basis, this group will evaluate data relevant to breastfeeding support services and formulate, along with administrators, a plan of action to implement needed changes. Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding 1. Have a written breastfeeding policy that is routinely communicated to all health care staff. 2. Train all health care staff in the skills necessary to implement this policy. 3. Inform all pregnant women about the benefits and management of breastfeeding. 4. Help mothers initiate breastfeeding within one hour of birth. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 82 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL 5. Show mothers how to breastfeed and how to maintain lactation, even if separated from their infants. 6. Give infants no food or drink other than breast milk, unless medically indicated. 7. Practice rooming in - all mothers and infants to remain together 24 hours a day. 8. Encourage breastfeeding on dema nd. 9. Give no pacifiers or artificial nipples to breastfeeding infants. 10. Foster the establishment of breastfeeding support groups and refer mother to them on discharge from the hospital or birth center. Refer to UC Davis Health Policy 16025 Breastfeeding Guidelines . Aging Initiatives Patients 65 and older make up about 40% of the UC Davis Medical Center population. Our Vision: To create the healthiest and highest -functioning older adult population in Northern California due to the care, research, and innovation at UC Davis Health. Our Mission: UC Davis Health promotes healthy aging through an integrated approach acro ss the lifespan and all care settings: providing age -friendly care, supporting family caregivers, leveraging cutting -edge research, integrating technology for independent living, and educating the next generation of clinicians through degree programs, fell owships, and certifications.

UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 86 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Promoting Healthcare Equality Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQ I) people often experience stigma, discrimination, and institutional bias in health care systems , which can result in worse health outcomes. Knowing the patient's sexual orientation and gender id entity (SOGI) information can reduce these health disparities by helping providers give better, more informed care for LGBTQ I patients. UC Davis Health is the first academic health system in the nation to include SOGI as standardized demographic informatio n within the Electronic Medical Record (EMR). While discussing SOGI as part of a patient's medical history may be uncomfortable for some of us at first, it does become easier with time and practice. Please consider that this may also be an awkward and pote ntially traumatizing experience for an LGBTQI patient if not done in a respectful manner . A great way to start this discussion is by sharing your own name and pronouns and asking a patient for theirs. We do a disservice to our LGBTQI patients if we fail to respectfully discuss the areas of gender and sexuality and explore how they may impact both physical and mental health. Our LGBTQI patients deserve acknowledgement of these aspects of their identities, lives and health, as well as access to high - quality, competent, relevant and efficient medical care and treatment interventions. Be sure to review and update (if needed) the information in the chart on the Storyboard or via the SOGI activity. Data captured here can be used to track health disparities, improv e EMR decision support, and above all, support patient -centered care. Since 2011 , the UC Davis Health has been recognized as a \"LGBTQ Healthcare Equality Leader\" by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. This recognition underscores UC Davis Health's commitment to providing compassionate and quality care to all patients, regardless of their SOGI. LGBTQ I patients, especially transgender patients, will be treated with the same dignity, respect, and quality care as all UC UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 87 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Davis Health patients, i n all aspects of the clinical encounter. This is consistent with the UC Davis's guiding principles: UC Davis Principles of Community https://diversity.ucdavis.edu/principles -community If you are in need of additional training on aspects of LGBTQI patient care, UC Davis Health employees have access to over 60 different free online and on -demand CME accredited LGBTQ Patient -Centered Care training oppor tunities through the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, please see the information, associated links and instructions for access at https://bit.ly/3jdEvv9 . For more informat ion, please contact: Vice Chancellor's LGBTQ+ Advisory Council - https://health.ucdavis.edu/lgbtq -council/index.html Ordering Medical Interpreters for Pa tients with Limited English Proficiency and Deaf/Hard of Hearing Patients Trained medical interpreters are available in person, via video and telephone to all Limited English Proficient (LEP) and deaf/hard of hearing patients to facilitate care between pat ient and provider, including following up with patients at home after procedures. In accordance with current legislative and regulatory requirements, UC Davis Health patients seeking and receiving care will have access to qualified medical interpreters and are not required to bring or provide an interpreter. Medical interpreters are trained in medical vocabulary, comprehension, retention, and note -taking. They are trained to respect patient confidentiality, pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPA A), to honor their own neutral role and work to maintain the integrity of the patient/provider relationship. Therefore, the use of family members as medical interpreters is strongly discouraged. Some patients may pre fer to bring or provide an interpreter. In such cases, UC Davis Health will permit patients to do so as long as it does not compromise the quality of patient care services and will document patient's declination of staff or vendor interpreting services in EMR. UC Davis Health does not reimburse for interpreting services provided by non -UC Davis Health interpreters at the patient's request. Minors should not serve as interpreters. When scheduling patient appointments, language information shall be captured. Interpreting services to the deaf/hard of hearing patients are required under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act.

As the opioid epidemic continues to rise and regulators clamp down on prescribing requireme nts, hospitals become bigger targets for diversion of controlled substances. Drug diversion is a multifactorial and multidisciplinary issue, particularly involving pharmacy, nursing , and medical staff. Drug diversion is defined by the Drug Enforcement Age ncy (DEA) as the use of prescription drugs for recreational or illicit purposes. In recent years, the DEA has levied multi -million -dollar fines against healthcare institutions for drug diversion events and a lack of oversight of controlled substance medica tion usage. Controlled substance medication usage and the investigation of suspected drug diversion events are reviewed by the Medication Diversion Oversight Committee (MDOC), an interdisciplinary committee composed of health system leadership that is char ged with the prevention and detection of drug diversion. MDOC has developed a training module (DAHS -NGNYRSDD17), available in the UC Learning Center, to give staff an overview of drug diversion, the signs and symptoms of diversion, and contacts to report known or suspected diversion acts. Health system staff will receive regular and timely updates on expected behavior for controlled substance drug handling so that they may identify suspicious activity or behaviors that may be indicative of drug diversion. To report possible diversion activity, contact one's supervisor, nursing supervisor/manager, pharmacy administration, or call the confidential compliance hotline at 877 -384-4272.

Securing and Encrypting Portable Electronic Devic es Portable electronic devices such as laptops and USB keys can be a convenient way to transport and store Information. These devices, however, pose a high -risk of compromising data, privacy , and security when misplaced or stolen. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 90 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL UC Davis Health data sho uld be stored on a secured UC Davis Health IT network location or UC Davis Health Office 365 OneDrive. Laptops used for UC Davis Health business should always be issued by the University and must be encrypted. If you need to use a USB drive to carry data, the drive should be encrypted, password protected, and issued by UC Davis Health IT. To obtain an IT -issued USB drive, submit a request online through the Employee Self -Service portal or by contacting UCD Health TOC at 916-734-HELP (4357). Photography and Video Recording Photographs and videos documenting patient care are a valuable means for advancing clinical, educational, and research objectives. This activity, however, presents an inherent risk to patient privacy because it typically includes identifiable information (e.g. , patient arm with unique injury/skin condition , an identifiable tattoo , or enough of a patient's face). Therefore, the utmost care should be taken with how photographs and/or videos are taken, stored, and used at UC Davis Health. Written p atient consent is required in advance of any photography or video recording UNLESS the photography is solely for clinical purposes or internal educational purposes. All clinical photography should be obtained and retained via a secure means. When being used for medical treatment, the images should be uploaded in the patient's electronic medical record . Images not used for medical trea tment should be uploaded on a UC Davis Health secure server, such as the Shared or \"S\" drive. Haiku (a mobile app available for iOS and Android devices) and Canto (an iPad app) can be utilized to retain and upload patient photos and must be used for patien t photos for clinical use. Use of native smartphone camera apps by workforce members as a means to capture or store photographs or video recordings is prohibited except under certain conditions . When native smartphone camera apps are allowed by policy , the device must not automatically backup or upload to a non -HIPAA complian t storage location (e.g., cloud storage). To minimize the risk to patient privacy, photographs and video recording s containing patient information should be promptly deleted from the r ecording device once incorporated into the patient's record. Please review the following policies for additional information about protecting PHI on mobile or hand -held devices, photography expectations, and medical documentation requirements: o UC Davis Health Policy 1313 Protected Health Information or Personal Information on Mobile Devices and Personal Computers o UC Davis Health Policy 1426 Authorization and Consent to Photograph or Interview o UC Davis Health Policy 1450 Destruction of Confidential Records o UC Davis Health Policy 2315 Incorporating Paper Records/Media into the EMR o UC Davis Hea lth Policy 2393 Creating, Using, and Managing Images in the Medical Setting UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 91 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Social Media Social media is a valuable way of interacting and communicating ideas. However, s ocial media in a healthcare setting can present h igh risk s to the organization's commitment to confidentiality and patient privacy. UC Davis Health Policy 1307 Social Media Policy establishes the soci al media usage rules for UC Davis Health workforce members and these rules apply whether students or employees are posting to their own sites, managing an official UC Davis Health site , or simply commenting or posting on other sites. For example, the policy expressly prohibits workforce members from using or disclosing patient information on any social media platform unless they have obtained prior written authorization from the patient. Examples of risky posts include: A photograph taken in a work area where a patient or computer screen is visible in the background, or Commenting about a specific patient case (e.g. , \"I saw a patient with a snake bite in the ED today\") which is seen by a nd \"identifiable\" to the patient's family . It is important to be extremely conscientious when posting about the workplace on social media and staff should be mindful of any content they post online to ensure patient confidentiality. Below are more detailed rules for appropriately using social media accounts. Do not share confidential or proprietary information about the University on social media sites. This includes company competitive information, financial information, intellectual property , and business e-mail messages. Do not use the University name to im ply or create the impression that your opinions represent those of the University. If you identify your affiliation to UC Davis Health or your connection to the University is apparent, make it clear th at you are speaking for yourself and not on behalf of UC Davis Health. For example, you can make a disclaimer saying, \"The views expressed on this site are my own and do not reflect the views of my employer.\" Before creating an official University social m edia account, email Public Affairs at hs- socialmedia@ucdavis.edu . You must receive approval from the Public Affairs & Marketing team and follow all established policies and guidelines. Employee personal social media accounts should not reference the UC Davis He alth name or trademarks. While this includes the title of the site, the social media name , and even the web address, employees can, however, accurately describe their r elationship to the University. For example, stating that you work at UC Davis Health on your LinkedIn page is appropriate, but a blog titled \"UC Davis Health Physicians Give Advice\" would be inappropriate. Do not use or disclose ANY patient information on any social media site without th e patient's written permission. This includes personal and University -hosted accounts. Even if the individual is not directly identified, if it is possible for that person to be identified by the UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 92 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL information posted, then it could be a HIPAA violation and carry heavy personal and organizational penalties. All patients referenced, quoted, described , or otherwise identified on any social media site must complete a UC Davis Health Patient Authorization form as outlined in UC Davis Health Policy 1426 . UC Davis Health discourages \"friending\" or following patients , and staff should not initiate or accept such requests except under special circumstances. For example, accepting a request when the friendship pre -dates the treatment relationship. Managers are also discouraged from initiating \"friend\" requests with emplo yees they manage. However, managers can accept requests if they believe it will not negatively impact the work relationship .

Globally, the Compliance and Privacy Services Department (Compliance Department) is responsible for: Understanding the rule s and regulations ; Promoting a culture of compliance and ethical behavior; Implementing controls to identify risk s; Monitoring and auditing risks; Investigating possible non-compliance matters; and Working collaboratively with operations to resolve issues when they occur. The primary areas of focus for the Compliance Program include Privacy and Patient Confidentiality, Research Compliance, Billing and Coding, Investigations, and Vendor Relations/Conflicts of Interest and other General Compliance areas . The Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) is the individual empl oyed at UC Davis Health who is charged with overseeing the UC Davis Health Compliance and Privacy Program. The Chief Compliance Officer can be contacted at hs-compliancehelp@ucdavis.edu , or 916 -734-8808. Additional information about the Chief UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 93 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Compliance Officer can be found at the Compliance and Privacy Services webpage at https://health.ucdavis.edu/compliance/about/ . The rules governing the healthcare industry can be complicated. For this reason, it may be challenging to make the right choices when it comes to healthcare compliance. If you have a ny compliance questions or concerns, please ask for help. It is always bet ter to ask before taking an action that might not adhere to regulation or institutional policy . Staff may contact the Compliance and Privacy Department in the following ways : Phone: 916-734-8808 Fax: 916-734-0222 Compliance Training: HS-ComplianceTrain@ucdavis.edu General Compliance Training What is Health Care Compliance and Why is it So Important? In short, health care compliance is the ability to act in accordance with a set of rules that relate to health care practices. In h ealth care, compliance programs are developed according to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines which establishes the government's expectation of how a compliance program should operate. According to these federal standards, a complete health care compliance program includes: A Chief Compliance Officer and a Compliance Executive Committee; Compliant and Ethical policies and procedures; Compliance training/education for workforce members; Methods for reporting non -compliance and wrongdoing; Auditing/Monitoring of organizational activities; Fair and consistent enforcement of the rules; and Investigations of potential instances of non -compliance and wrongdoing. Ensuring compliance with health care rules is an important part of patient care. Additionally, it is required in order to participate in federal health care programs. Accepting government funding requires that we follow all relevant federal, state , and other rules for how we care for ou r patients, how their services are billed , and how we keep their records. Specifically, the government expects us to provide UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 94 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL medically necessary services and to bill them appropriately for that care. Failure to do so could lead to harsh penalties and can i nclude, but are not limited to: Contract termination, Mandatory training or re -training, Employment termination, Loss of license, Criminal penalties & imprisonment, Large financial penalties/fines, or Exclusion from participation in all federal health ca re programs. UC Davis Health Code of Conduct The UC Davis Health Code of Conduct is a tool to guide staff in understanding the organization's expectations for acting with integrity. The Code of Conduct consists of various s tandards, which address known are as of compliance risk. Each standard provides information on the appropriate conduct to follow and suggestions for handling problems that may arise. All individuals at UC Davis Health are expected to read and fully understand the Code of Conduct. The UC Da vis Health Code of Conduct is in Appendix B of this document. An online version can be found at http://health.ucdavis.edu/compliance/general/code_of_conduct/ . After reading the Code of Conduct: Staff are expected to avoid involvement in illegal, unethical , or otherwise improper acts; Staff should seek guidance from the Compliance Department if they are unsure about the permissibility or appropria teness of an activity; Staff must promptly report any perceived violations of the Code of Conduct, rules and regulations, policies, or the Compliance Program to the Compliance Department; Staff must cooperate during the investigation of any alleged violat ions; and Staff should immediately notify the Compliance Office if the government excludes staff from participation in any federally -funded or state -funded programs. University of California Statement of Ethical Values and Standards of Ethical Conduct In addition to UC Davis Health's Code of Conduct, the University of California (UC) has also adopted a Statement of Ethical Values which contains 12 standards that apply to all members of the UC community. Staff are also expected to read, understand , and abide by these ethical standards. The Standards can be found online at: http://www.ucop.edu/ethics -compliance -audit -services/_files/stmt - stds-ethics.pdf . UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 95 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Reporting Compliance Concerns To remain a compliant organization, it is necessary for staff to immediately report incidents of non- compliance or concerns to the Compliance Department even if they are not sure if there is a violation. You will not be penalized for making a good faith report even if the information cannot be verified . All members of the UC Davis Health workforce have an obligation to report activities they suspect: Are harmful to a patient, resi dent, family member , or staff member ; Are illegal or unethical ; May have compromised patient privacy or confidentiality ; Violate any state or federal healthcare program requirements; and/or ; Violate the Code of Conduct or a UC Davis Health policy or proced ure. All reported concerns are investigated or reviewed, and appropriate follow -up action is taken. It is never acceptable to overlook actual or potential wrongdoing. In addition to directly contacting the Compliance Department (using the contact informat ion listed above) , the workforce may also report concerns to the UC Compliance Hotline. The hotline is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and hotline reports can be handled anonymously. The Compliance Hotline can be reached at 1-800-403-4744 or onl ine at www.universityofcalifornia.edu/hotline . Please note that all observations or reports regarding sexual misconduct experienced by patients must be reported to the Harassment and Discrimination Assistance and Prevention Program (HDAPP) at 916 - 734-3417 or hdapp @ucdavis.edu , or the UC Davis Title IX Officer at 530 -752-9466 or wjdelmendo@ucdavis.edu . Protection from Retaliation Open communication and the freedom to report concerns regarding the operations or ethics of the organization are essential to the Compliance Program's success. Retaliation, retribution, or harassment of anyone who makes a good faith report regarding a violation will not be tole rated. In addition, UC policy, federal law , and state law protect any whistleblower employee or applicant for employment from retaliation for having reported an issue or filing a whistleblower report. The UC Whistleblower Protection policy can be found onl ine at https://www.ucop.edu/uc -whistleblower/ . Important Compliance Standards False Claims Recovery Act After patient care is provided and documented, caregivers and co ders translate documentation into a bill for payment. When a bill is submitted to the government for payment from the Medicare or Medi - Cal programs, a \"claim\" has been created. Clear and complete documentation is always part o f good care, and without it, UC Davis Health cannot bill for the services provide d. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 96 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL UC Davis Health must seek to ensure that bill s for services are medically necessary and provided in the manner stated on a claim. A claim for payment of services that does not meet these requirements could be a \"False Claim .\" What are Examples of a False Claim? Under the Federal False Claims Act (FCA), the federal government may prosecute, criminally or civilly, individuals or entities who submit or cause to be submitted claims for payment when the c laims are false. In the healthcare industry this includes Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs. Some examples of a false claim include , but are not limited to: Billing twice for the same service ; Billing for services not rendered ; Billing for medically unnecessary services or falsifying certificates of medical necessity ; Unbundling or billing separately for services that should be billed as one ; Creating false medical records or treatment plans to increase payments ; Failing to report and refund overpayments or credit balances ; Physician billing without personal involvement for services rendered by medical students, interns, residents or fellows in teaching hospitals; and Giving and/or receiving unlawful inducements to healthcare providers for referrals for services. Preventing Fraud, Waste and Abuse Fraud, waste and abuse (FWA) typically occurs when someone is trying to get payment or benefits from the government that they are not entitled to. E ven when FWA laws are violated unintentionally, penalties can still be imposed on the organization or an individual. It is important that all UC Davis Health personnel become familiar with the FWA rules , and refrain from any of the following activities: Fraud: Knowingly billing for services/supplies not provided, or knowingly altering claim forms, medical records, or receipts to receive a higher payment. Waste : Conducting excessive office visits , writing unneeded prescriptions, or ordering unnecessary labor atory tests. Abuse : Billing for brand name drugs when generics are dispensed. UC Davis Health Policy 1936 Deficit Reduction Act Compliance provide s detailed information about the False Claims Act and the University's administrative remedies for false claims and statements. Additionally, departmental policies and workflows often incorporate regulatory rules and requirements . Adhering to these standards is the first step in complying with the FCA rules and preventing FWA. Other things UC Davis Health employees can do to prevent FWA are to: Look for suspicious activity Perform job duties and other work -related responsibilities in an ethical manner Ensure accurate and timely processing or documentation of data/billing UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 97 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Follow all applicable laws, regulations, policies , and standards of conduct Report FWA or any instances of non -compliance to the Compliance Department immediately Annual Medical Notice to Ph ysicians This annual medical notice is for UC Davis Health physicians. TO: UC Davis Health PHYSICIANS FROM: UC Davis Health Clinical Laboratories RE: OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL, COMPLIANCE PLAN As part of UCDH Clinical Laboratories' oversight plan for the Federal Office of Inspector General (OIG), we are required to annual ly notify all physicians of the following policies, developed to reflect government guidance: Medicare national and local medical review policies exist for certain lab tests. Specific information on National Coverage Determinations (NCDs) and Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs) can be found on the CMS website ( Medicare Coverage - General Information | CMS ), and through the local carrier, Noridian ( https://med.noridianmedicare.com/web/jea/policies ) Medicare and some other pay ers will not pay for screening tests if the patient displays no symptoms or evidence of disease and may not pay for tests that are not FDA approved or are experimental. Medi -Cal fees are equal to or lower than Medicare lab fees. All panels (organ and dise ase) will be billed and paid only when all components are medically necessary. UCDH Clinical Laboratories utilize reflex testing to validate primary test results or add additional testing when medically appropriate. A list of the reflex tests is reviewed/a pproved at least annually by the Medical Staff Executive Committee and is available at https://www.testmenu.com/ucdavis . A current Medicare lab fee schedule with CPT (curren t protocol terminology) codes is available directly from CMS at the following website: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ClinicalLabFeeSched Material contained in this yearly notification is current as of the date published and is subject to change without notice. This OIG believes that a physician who orders medically unnecessary tests and knowingly causes a false claim to be submitted may be subject to sanctions or remedies u nder criminal or administrative law. In addition, we are required by Audit Services to communicate to you the means by which you may report incidences of fraud, abuse, waste , or misconduct. Reporting can be done by contacting the Systemwide Whistleblower Hotline at (800) 403 -4744. For more information, go to http://universityofcalifornia.edu/hotline . UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 98 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL If you have any questions regarding the content of this memo, plea se contact Lydia Howell, MD, CLIA Laboratory Director at 916 -734-3330 or lphowell@ucdavis.edu . Anti -Kickback Statute A kickback is when medical providers accept anything of value from a third party in return for prescribing medications or using their products or services. The Anti -Kickback Statute prohibits knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying any type of compensation in exchange for referrals for services that are paid, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program like Medicare or Medi -Cal. This means that federal law prohibits you from accepting anything of value from third parties in exchange for referring patients or f or ordering items or services. Violations of these rules are punishable by a fine up to $25,000 and/or imprisonment up to 5 years. Conflicts of Interest A conflict of interest (COI) occurs when an employee influences a decision for individual financial g ain. In health care, this results in a conflict between the primary goal of providing safe and efficient patient care and the personal or financial goals of the individual or the entity . These conflicts can be actual or perceived. For example, if a provide r is accepting funds from a drug or device company, it could be perceived that the company's payments to the provider are influencing their clinical or prescribing decisions even if the provider is doing what is best for the patient. Even perceived conflic ts can negatively affect our ability to provide quality patient care, so they should be avoided as well. Whether the conflict is actual or perceived, it is important that you are aware when a conflict may exist and that you avoid or remove the conflict as soon as possible. Gifts A gift is any payment or thing of value for which the recipient does not provide a service of similar or greater value in return. Below are some of the basic rules regarding gifts : UC Davis Health workforce members are prohibited f rom accepting gifts from vendors and their representatives. Gifts can include free or discounted items, samples, food , or other travel reimbursement. Honoraria provided for a legitimate service rendered (e.g., delivering a speech) is not considered a gift so long as payment is equivalent to the service rendered. Additional information about the University's gift rules can be found at: UC Davis Health Policy 2601 Gifts and Interactions with Vendors UCOP Acceptance of Gifts Policy: https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/1200366/AcceptanceofGifts UCOP Health Care Vendor Relations Policy: https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/5000433/Hea lthVendorRelations UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 99 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Vendor Access Program The UC Health Care Vendor Relations policy provides system -wide standards aimed at reducing the potential for industry influence on our providers' University and patient care decisions. Proper vendor credentialing helps UC Davis Health ensure a safe patien t and work environment , but also the necessary controls to uphold our values of integrity in every situation. As such, the University has implemented the Reptrax tool to monitor vendors who visit our campus and has developed policies to govern employee int eractions with vendors. While it is important for vendors to understand and uphold University policies and standards, it is equally important for the UC Davis Health workforce to understand these rules and hold visiting representatives accountable. Vendors who do not follow federal, state, and University rules should be asked to leave and/or reported to the Purchasing Department by calling 916 -734-2475. Representatives entering any of the UC Davis Health facilities must: Register with SEC3URE (also known as Reptrax); Complete all credentialing requirements; Comply with the Vendor Access Program rules; Maintain up -to-date credentials in Reptrax; Wear the Reptrax issued badge so that is clearly visible to all staff and other visitors; and Follow all federal, s tate and University rules. If you have any questions related to vendor compliance or need to report vendor non -compliance, please contact the UC Davis Health Compliance Department directly at https://health.ucdavis.edu/compliance/contact/ . Additional information about the Vendor Access Program can be found in the following resources: Frequently Asked Questions: https://health.ucdavis.edu/compliance/general/Vendor_Compliance/VendorCompliancePage.html Summary of Vendor Access Rules for Workforce Members: https://health.ucdavis.edu/compliance/pdf/Reptrax/1%20Pager%20Workforce%20FINAL.pdf Summary of Vendor Access Rules for Vend ors: https://health.ucdavis.edu/compliance/pdf/Reptrax/1%20Pager%20Vendor%20FINAL.pdf Open Payments/Sunshine Act The Sunshine Act requires public reporting of payments to physicians , physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and anesthesiologist assistants, certified nurse midwives, and teaching hospita ls from pharmaceutical and medical device UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 100 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL companies . Public reporting is through the CMS Open Payments program to increase transparency in payments made to covered recipients by these manufacturers. Payments and other 'value transfers' are published on a y early basis on the CMS Open Payments program website . Each year, the Open Payments data is reviewed to ensure compliance with relevant conflict of interest and con flict of commitment guidelines and regulations. UC Davis Health Privacy Program UC Davis Health's Privacy Program focuses on maintaining the confidentiality and privacy of patient information. In addition to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountabil ity Act of 1996 (HIPAA), its implementing regulations, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health of 2009 (HITECH), California has several state laws governing health information privacy, including the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA) and the Information Practices Act. As a workforce member, you are always required to protect patient information. While this obligation may be challenging given the dynamic nature of your work , UC Davis Health has many resources available to assist you with this duty. If there are questions about patient privacy, please call the UC Davis Health Compliance and Privacy Services Department main line at 916 -734-8808 or email the Privacy Program at hs-privacyprogram@ucdavis.edu . Important Privacy Topics Access to Patient Information UC Davis Health is committed to ensur ing the confidentiality of our patients' information. To ensure patient information is kept secure and confidential , information should only be accessed for a work purpose . For example, t he public health climate of 202 3 can lead to anxiety and curiosity about the health status of colleagues and patients around us . However, it is important \u2014now more than ever \u2014to be diligent in protecting and limiting access to our patients ' information. Some important privacy reminders rel ated to accessing patient information: Patient information must only be accessed when performing a job function. It is never permissible to use or access patient information for a non -work purpose. For example, it is not permissible to access a patient's e lectronic medical record (EMR) out of curiosity. Do not use EMR credentials to access your own record or the record of family members. Health information should be accessed through a MyChart ( MyUCDavisHealth ) account or by requesting the medical record fr om the Health Information Management (HIM) department . Do not access the patient information of your co -workers, friends, or family members UNLESS they are your current patient and/or you are performing assigned employment duties and responsibilities for t hem. As part of the Privacy Program 's protective function , user access to the EMR is monitored on a regular basis. Any access that appears to be for a non-work purpose will be immediately UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 101 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL investigated. Intentional access to EMRs without a work purpose can result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. Disclosure of Patient Information Disclosure of patient information should only occur to facilitate a work function. Some important privacy reminders related to disclosing patient information: Physical Disclosure - Many reportable privacy incidents involve the mishandling of paper documents. These incidents are unintentional and may be avoided by taking some simple steps : Implementing privacy -protective processes. Promptly pick up printed info rmation from a printer and/or fax machine. Doubl e checking documents prior to delivery or sending . Highlight or otherwise check identifiers on printed documents before disclosing them. Electronic Disclosure - Transmitting patient information through email, fax, or any other electronic means to the correct recipient ensures confidentiality and protects against threats to the security or integrity of the information. Some recommendations to minimize this risk include: Verify you have the correct email address or fax number for the intended recipient. Only use My UCDavisHealth to communicate with patients. When transmitting patient information via email to any non -UC Davis Health recipient, the email should also be encrypted in accordance with UC Davis Health Policy 2442 E -Mail Communication that Contains Protected Health Information or Personal Information . Forwarding work emails to a non -UC Davis Health email account (e.g. , Gmail, Yahoo, or any other email account) is not allowed. For additional information, please review UC Davis Health Policy 1314 E -Mail Use for UCDMC Personnel (Employees, Faculty, Staff, Volunteers and Students) . Verbal Disclosure - When discussing patient information for treatment and/or other work -related purposes in an unsecure location (e.g., in a hallway, waiting room, cafeteria), it is important to maintain patient confidentiality to prevent improper disclosure . Some recommendations to minimize this risk include: Discussions about patients should occur in a confidential space and not in a hallway, waiting room, or other public space . Be mindful of your speaking volume when talking with patients or anyone involved in a patient's care. Obtain the patient's authorization , to allow them to agree or object, prior to disclosing their information to a family member or close personal friend. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 102 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Reporting Privacy Incidents UC Davis Health is required to investigate any potential breach or misuse of patient information. This includes both intentional and inadvertent privacy events. As an organization, all these events must be promptly reported to Compliance and Privacy Services. The failure to report such events can result in significant fines and penalties against the organizatio n and the individuals involved. Promptly report a known or suspected breach of patient information to the Compliance and Privacy Services Department as soon as you discover it by emailing hs-privacyprogra m@ucdavis.edu or calling 916-734-8808. For additional information about breach reporting, please review UC Davis Health Policy 1302 Protected He alth Information, Personal Information Breach Notification . Research Compliance Program The Research Compliance Program provides oversight, education, and ongoing support to all areas of UC Davis Health related to clinic al research billing, research privacy, and other research regulatory matters to ensure compliance with applicable federal and state laws, regulations , and policies. Two major areas of focus for the program are clinical research billing and research privacy . More information about these programs is located on the Compliance Website at: http:// health.ucdavis.edu/compliance/research/ Clinical Research Billing (CRB) Clinical research billing is a critical compliance concern for any academic medical center. The focus of a clinical research billing compliance program is to ensure that research -related clinical costs are directed to the correct payer. In some cases, cost s for research -related medical services may be billed to the patient or the patient's insurance. However, insurance cannot be billed when the costs of medical items or services are reimbursed by another source, such as the study sponsor, or when the items or services are provided only for research purposes without therapeutic intent. Some of the safeguards to ensure that research costs are appropriately captured include, but are not limited to: Completion of the Medicare Coverage Analysis (MCA) to determine if the research study qualifies to bill routine costs in a clinical trial to Medicare or insurance . Completion of a billing grid to identify costs billable to Medicare/insurance or the study account . Completion of the Clinical Trials Data Bridge to create a study record and document the MCA . Associating research subjects to the study in Epic . Associating protocol -directed orders and encounters to the study in Epic . Timely completion of Epic research billing review to ensure charges are routed appropriately . More information on this process is available in the UC Davis Health Clinical Research Guidebook . Ensurin g appropriate billing of clinical research costs is a complex task, and all research personnel are encouraged to seek training specific to their research responsibilities. The UC Davis Clinical Trials Office offers numerous training opportunities, includin g a foundational course that covers the above topics UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 103 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL and more. Additional information is available on their website at : https://health.ucdavis.edu/ctsc/area/clinicaltrials/ . Clinical research billing questions can be emailed to: hsresearchcompliance@ou.ad3.ucdavis.edu . Research Privacy Federal and state laws, such as t he Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and California Medical Information Act (CMIA), as well as UC Davis Health policies and procedures specifically address how protected health information (PHI) can be utilized for research purposes. In general, a patient's medical information may only be accessed for a treatment, payment , or operational purpose without obtaining prior written authorization . Access to patient records for most other purposes, including research, requi res additional steps to be taken to comply with state and federal privacy laws. In most instances, the Privacy Rule requires a signed authorization from the individual before access, use or disclosure of PHI for research purposes. Authorization is typicall y secured by having research subjects sign the HIPAA Authorization for Research Form at the time of conse nt. The HIPAA Authorization for Research Form is a separate and distinct form from the study's informed consent form (ICF). Permission to access, use, or disclose PHI for research purposes is not obtained simply by the subject signing the ICF. Access to a patient's record for research purposes must occur in accordance with the protocol, informed consen t, and signed authorization. In limited situations, the Privacy Rule allows an Institutional Review Board (IRB) to waive the requirement for a signed authorization for the use of PHI in research. To obtain a waiver, UC Davis Health's researchers must complete the applicable waiver sec tion of the electronic Initial Review Application when submitting their protocol. Once conducting the study, accounting of disclosure must be completed by researchers when patient information is accessed for a research purpose under an IRB approved waiver of Authorization. For more information about the privacy rules related to research and instructions for completing accounting disclosures, refer to the UC Davis Health Clinical Research Guidebook . Additional information about the IRB's HIPAA waiver process is available on the UC Davis Office of Research website at https://research.ucdavis.edu/policiescompliance/irb -admin/researchers/project -guidance/medical - records Coding and Billing Compliance UC Davis Health is comm itted to honesty, accuracy , and integrity in all patient charging, coding, billing , and documentation activities. UC Davis Health workforce members are expected to adhere to the following guidelines when engaging in coding, billing , and documentation activ ities: UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 104 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Healthcare services provided must be medically necessary and rendered by qualified healthcare professionals in accordance with the scope of practice and federal and state laws. Assignment of CPT, HCPCS, and ICD -10 codes is based on the medical re cord documentation and payer specific guidelines. Medical record documentation must meet the requirements outlined in UC Davis Health Policy 2307 Medical Record Documentation Standards and as applicable in Policies 1930 Scribe Notes and 1905 Drug Documentation and Billing . With a limited exception, teaching physician services may be billed to Medicare only when the documentation supports that the teaching physician provided a direct service to the patient. See Primary Care Exceptions for E/M Services. All providers new to UC Davis Health that are seeking billing privileges must complete the mandatory Billing Compliance Training. Completion of this training is mandatory to release charges. A link to the training and additional information for each role can be found on the intranet at http://intranet.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/him/etp/etp.shtml . Documentation/ Electronic Medical Record Compliance Banned Abbreviations Abbreviations are commonly used in medical documentation out of convenience to save time. However, abbreviations may result in possible patient harm if misread or misinterpreted. UC Davis Health has adopted an abbreviations policy ( UC Davis Health Policy 2305 Approved Abbreviations ), which outlines appropriate acronyms, abbreviations, and symbols to guide documentation and interpretation of notes for use in medical documentation. View examples of banned abbreviations below. For more, please visit UC Davis Health Policy 2305(1) Banned Abbreviations List . Example Banned Abbreviation Potential Problem Preferred Term U (for unit) Mistaken as zero, four, or cc Write \"unit\" Q.D. (for daily) Mistakenly transposed ; the period after the \"Q\" can be mistaken for an \"I\" Write \"daily\" < and > or and Mistakenly used opposite of intended Write \"greater than\" or \"less than\" UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 105 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Verbal Orders This section outlines the use of verbal orders as described in UC Davis Health Policy 18009 Provider Orders . Verbal orders are to be used infrequently and limited to those situations where it is impossible or impractic al for the ordering provider to enter an order in the Electronic Medical Record (EMR). Verbal orders may be used in the following situations: When the provider does not have access to the EMR (e.g., when the nurse or allied health professional has initiate d a call to the provider requesting an order and the provider reports that they do not have current access to the EMR) . When the provider is off -site between the hours of 2300 and 0600. During a procedure, in which case the order will be entered by appropr iate staff and signed by the ordering provider immediately following the procedure. In an emergency/urgent situation when it cannot wait for the provider to enter the order. When the issuing provider is participating in teaching rounds (not work rounds). Verbal orders must not be issued for complex or multiple orders due to patient safety risks. When verbal orders are used, they may only be issued by a licensed or registered physician, NP, PA , or CRNA. Verbal orders for medication may only be accepted by re gistered nurses or pharmacists in the inpatient setting. However, in the outpatient setting, verbal orders for medications may be accepted by RNs, LVNs, and pharmacists. Allied health professionals may accept verbal orders specific to their scope of practi ce When verbal orders are issued: They must be read back to the ordering provider. The person accepting the verbal order should enter the order into the EMR and read it back to the ordering provider. Leading zeros and decimal points must be vocalized. The identity of the ordering provider must also be confirmed by verifying the name and PI number. If the recipient of a verbal order cannot reasonably access a computer, the order may be written down on paper, read back to the ordering provider, and later entered into the EMR. In any case, verbal orders are entered into the EMR using \"Verbal with read back\" as the order mode and the name of the ordering provider who issued it. The recipient of a verbal order then electronically signs the order in the EMR, which records the date/time of the order and the recipient's professional title. All verbal orders must be cosigned by the ordering provider within 48 hours from the date and time the order was entered. Timely signing of verbal orders is regularly monito red and reported to department UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 106 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL chairs. Failure by providers to cosign verbal orders within 48 hours could result in the assessment of a fine against the department of the non -compliant provider. Providers are not required to sign erroneous verbal orders. R efer to Section V I.B. of the policy regarding verbal orders entered in error. Sharing Notes with Patients As of November 2020, UC Davis Health has been sharing most notes across ambulatory, inpatient, and ED for all author types in order to improve transparency with patients, which has been shown to improve patient engagement and may improve adherence to treatment plans. In addition, this assures compliance with the 21st Century Cures Act. Other Electronic Health Information (EHI), as defined by the information in the Designated Record Set, in any system (not just Epic), needs to be shared with patients or other authorized persons upon request. Consider the patient a nd their family as one of many audiences and maintain professionalism: avoid criticizing colleagues or using judgmental language about the patient. Objective facts are usually appropriate to share. If, in your professional judgment, sharing a note would v iolate the privacy of the patient (e.g., by being viewed by a proxy or if access is coerced) OR sharing might lead to physical harm to the patient or substantial harm to another person , you can un -click the 'share with patient' button and document which ac ceptable exception applies in that case. See UC Davis Health Policy 2301 CURES Act and Information Blocking for details on acceptable reasons to not sha re notes with patients. If the patient requests that the note NOT be shared, you can block sharing as well. This might be relevant if the patient does not want sensitive information visible to proxies. This could be appropriate in abusive situations, gende r-affirming or reproductive health, etc . Sharing Results with Patients Federal law also requires sharing results with patients electronically and 'without delay'. State laws do take precedence, so tests that might show cancer, HIV antibodies, hepatitis antigens, or drug abuse will be delayed to allow verbal discussion of the results with the patient before release . If your professional judgement determines that sharing the result might lead to physical harm to the patient or substantial harm to another p erson , you can block the release of the result. This is possible in the details of an order before signing it. After signing, the 'MyChart Results Release' activity or Chart Review will allow control over patients' view of results before or after it is fi nalized. Document in a note what exclusion is used to justify blocking . Expanded Digital Sharing of Electronic Health Information at Patients Request All Electronic Health Information that is possible to be shared must be shared, upon request , with patients or their designees. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 107 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL This includes all data that is stored or transmitted in electronic form , is personally identifiable , and used in clinical decision making with the exceptions of psychotherapy data, legal cases, and those covered by the eight exceptions mentioned above . Important Caveats Not just data in Epic Does not have to be shared through MyChart Does not have to be made available without request Additional detailed information is available on the UC Davis Health 21st Century Cures Act website . Copy and Paste Guidelines Quality documentation supports patient care, patient and caregiver engagement, continuity of care, record integrity, and accurate coding. As such, UC Davis Health Policy 2307 Medical Record Documentation Standards outlines specific guidelines and standards for timely, complete , and accurate documentation of healthcare services. The policy also outlines the appropriate use of the copy and paste functionality available in the EMR fo r all relevant providers including physicians, residents, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and other documenting providers. Appropriate use of the EMR copy and paste functionality eliminates duplication of effort and saves time, but it must be u sed carefully to ensure accurate documentation. Indiscriminate use of copying and pasting may lengthen notes by including unnecessary or redundant information, making it difficult for others to quickly locate pertinent information. It may also result in re cord inaccuracies. Some guidelines when using copy and paste are: Copying forward information should be avoided , especially that which is no longer relevant to the patient's current condition. Only copy information that remains accurate and relevant . It is imperative to appropriately edit any pasted information to assure accuracy. The author is responsible for the accuracy and appropriateness of the information incorporated into their documentation, whether it is copied, pasted, imported , or reused. Befor e adding results and procedures to a note, consider if it will be of use to readers, keeping the fact in mind that information is already available in the chart. Consider a summary and/or interpretation of a test instead. Un-synthesized data leads to 'note bloat' and rarely contributes to supporting billing requirements. If test results/procedures are copied and pasted into an encounter note, the date of the original test result or procedure should be noted. Information from SmartLinks should be refreshed s o the information is up to date. Information that should not be copied: a physical exam, assessment , and plan from another service; or a medical student's note . UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 108 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL All entries in the EMR must be patient - and visit -specific, must reflect the actual data colle cted and/or reviewed, and be confirmed by the provider based on medical necessity and personally rendered services. Providers may reference their own prior entries and/or other providers' entries in the patient's record (by noting the specific date and tim e of the referenced entry), such as when the information is pertinent to the reason for the visit, the patient's history, test , or imaging results, etc. Providers should avoid: Inappropriate use of copy/paste functionality Over -documentation of clinicall y irrelevant information (not medically necessary) Copying redundant information (provided in other parts of the legal medical record) What is Considered Copy and Paste? For purposes of this standard, \" copy \" shall be understood to include: copy/paste, co py forward, imported documentation, \"roll -in,\" pull -forward, auto -populate features, and any other intent to move documentation from one part of the record to another section of the health record (or to another patient's record). Cloned documentation refer s to medical record documentation that is identical or unreasonably similar to the previous entries for a patient (or another patient's record) Some Examples of Inappropriate Copy and Paste: Identical entries - Entries that are exactly alike between visi ts or between providers. The visit note contains the exact same history of present illness, review of systems, physical exam , and/or care plan. Same patient with identical notes, unchanged from one visit to the next. Different patients with identical entries regardless of the patient involved. Care team notes that are the same and make it difficult to determine who provided the service, e.g., teaching physician's note is identical to the house staff note; attending ph ysician's note is identical to the mid -level provider's note. Unreasonably similar entries - such as entries that are almost identical to previous entries within an individual's medical record. Provider Responsibilities and Good Practices: Be aware of n ew documentation guidelines. These went into effect in January 2021 for ambulatory encounters and in January 2023 for ED and Inpatient encounters. o The emphasis is on Management and Evaluation documentation or time spent. o Exam and Review of Systems no long er drive coding; include just what is relevant to a patient's clinical situation. o Bringing information into the note provides little value, so avoid \"Note Bloat\" by summarizing and synthesizing data rather than using SmartLinks. Authenticate notes. Signed notes are \"final\" and become part of the patient's legal medical record. Additiona l information may only be included as an addendum or a new entry. The provider's signature shall serve as their attestation that the information (whether the content is UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 109 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL original or copied) is accurate, and that any copied information is current and represe nts the provider's services for that date of service. Notes are typically shared with patients when signed/co -signed by attending (inpatient and ED) or when an ambulatory encounter is closed. Identify the source of information copied from a prior note (i. e., date, time, prior note's author). Reconfirm and update as necessary to accurately reflect the care provided during the current encounter. Cite and summarize clinically applicable test results (labs, imaging, consult reports, etc.) by date and time, ra ther than copying the entire report into the current entry. Avoid copying one patient's medical record into a different patient's medical record. Discuss the review of systems (ROS) and past, family and social history (PFSH) with the patient and comment u pon pertinent updates to the current encounter, e.g. , \"ROS and PFSH are unchanged from previous encounter on MM/D D/YYYY\" - rather than copying / pasting the entire ROS and PFSH entry from a previous note or SmartLinking from the chart . Importing up -to-date content from PFSH -related sections of the EMR is legitimate if judged to be important . Use the approved teaching physician documentation template (i.e. , Smart Phrase ) in the EMR to document teaching physician services, rather than copying the supervisee's n ote in its entirety. Correct errors identified within the documentation in accordance with UC Davis Health Policy 2307 Medical Record Documentation Standards . If you are blocking the sharing of a note with patients/caregivers for a reason approved by the regulation, document the relevant exception using the pop -up window . General EMR documentation guidelines are available on the Health Information Manage ment EMR Training website at: http://intranet.UCDMC.ucdavis.edu/him/EMR_Train/media/Quality_Clin_Doc/Quality_Clinical_Docume ntation.p df For additional information, please review : UC Davis Health Policy 2307 Medical Records Documentation Standards . EMR Downtimes In addition to predictable quarterly downtimes, we may experience occasional unavailability of EMR access . In order to be prepared, be aware of the resources available : Read -only EMR: This is an environmen t that contains recent information about your patients, that is available when Production Epic is down for planned or unplanned downtimes. If your location has lost internet connectivity, most departments have at least one downtime computer , which contain s summary reports for patients on the schedule (ambulatory) or registered for inpatient or ED stays. It may have a battery backup to allow access in power outages. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 110 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL The Clini cal Re sources Center has many downtime forms to help you do your work when EMR in unavailable. Critically, copies of many sets, including the 20 most used order sets, are available for you to print and use to avoid delays of patient care . Spend a few moments before downtimes to familiarize yourself with these backup systems before they a re needed in a chaotic situation. Teaching Physicians: Billing Reminders and Resource Information on Documentation Resident Notes : Teaching physicians must document they performed the service or were physically present during the key/critical portions of the service and may refer to the resident's note for details . Medical Student Notes : Teaching physicians may only utilize student documentation when the teaching physician: Was present with the medical student for the exam and the medical deci sion making ; Repeated the examination; and Verified all of the student's documentation. Scribes : The use of scribes by UC Davis Health teaching/attending physicians is acceptable if performed in accordance with UC Davis Health Policy 1930 Scribe Notes . The billing provider who has electe d to use the services of a scribe is ultimately responsible for the content and accuracy of the scribed note.

The communication tool allows users to send secure, patient -centric instant messages to a single recipient or a group of colleagues. You can access Secure Chat via Epic Hyperspace on a desktop computer , Haiku on a SmartPhone, Canto (on a tablet ), and any devices with the Rover applica tion. General Messaging Considerations: UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 111 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Consider the recipient 's Secure Chat Status , as it will tell you if the recipient is available to receive messages. Consider the time frame in which you need a response. The following are examples: Routine = 4 hou rs inpatient, 24 hours ambulatory Important = 30 minutes inpatient, 4 hours ambulatory Critical = Immediate ( DO NOT USE Secure Chat; use current critical/urgent communication methods) If you do not get an expected response in the timeframe outlined, escalate to the next most appropriate party. Avoid sending messages without pertinent information as these types of messages result in alerts and will lead to \"alert fatigue\". In this case , NOT sending a separate \"thank you\" or similar message is the polite and professional option. Combine text into the fewest messages possible to avoid multiple notifications/interruptions to the receiver.

This policy governs affiliation agreements between UC and healthcare organizations that have policy -based restrictions on care (\"Covered Organizations\"). UC Office of the President (UCOP) subsequently developed a policy to implement Regents Policy 4405 : Affiliations with Certain Healthcare Organizations . This policy establishes standards for affiliation with Covered Organizations. UCDH created Policy 3106 Affiliations with Certain Healthcare Organizatio ns at UC Davis Health , which clarifies how the UCOP Policy and the Regents Policy will be implemented at UCDH. These policies and amendments to UCDH contracts with Covered Organizations ensure that the University's evide nce- based standards of care (not the Covered Organization's Policy -Based Restrictions) will govern the medical decisions made by UCDH personnel and trainees. Definitions: UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 112 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Covered Organization: A health care provider, health plan, or other organization owni ng or operating locations where Health Care Services are provided in the United States, that has adopted or operates pursuant to Policy -Based Restrictions on Health Care Services Policy -Based Restrictions: Restrictions imposed by a Covered Affiliate, direc tly or through its governing body or sponsors (or, in the case of a government agency or subdivision, as a matter of law, regulation, or agency directive), on evidence -based Health Care Services within the scope of a health care provider's license. This te rm does not refer to services that the Covered Affiliate is unable to provide to ANY patient due to absence of necessary equipment, or qualified personnel, lack of applicable licensure or accreditation, or lack of financial resources; or that the Covered A ffiliate limits or restricts as a result of credentialing, privileging, and utilization review policies or processes consistent with California Law and Medicare Conditions of Participation. Health Care Services: Items and services reimbursable by the Medi -Cal program or by any Federal Health Care Program (as defined in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a -7b(f)) Personnel: University -employed faculty and staff Trainees: Medical, nursing, and other health professional students and residents enrolled in University -sponsored edu cational programs Right of UC Davis Health Personnel and Trainees to Not Work at Covered Organization's Site No UCDH personnel nor trainees will be compelled to work or train at a facility that has adopted Policy - Based Restrictions on care.

Conflict of Commitment and Outside Professional Activities In accordance with UC Academic Personnel Manuals (APM) 025 and 671, all faculty are subject to earning thresholds and/or time limit for engaging in outside professional activities (OPAs). APM -671 governs faculty members who are members of the health sciences compensation plan and APM -025 governs faculty who are not part of the health sciences compensation plan. OPAs are compensated and uncompensated activities that are within a faculty member's area of professional, academic expertise and that advance or communicate that expertise through interaction with industry, the community , or the public. When these OPAs interfere with a faculty member's professional obligations to the University, this is called a conflict of commitment . While engaging in OPAs is allowed, faculty must be mindful of their annual earning thresholds and time limits in order to avoid potential conflicts of commitments. Specifically, APM -671 and APM -025 outline the maximum number of days that faculty may devo te to OPAs and the threshold for earned income before a conflict of commitment occurs. The OPA earning threshold for APM -671 faculty is $40,000 or 40% of their fiscal -year base salary scale (scale 0), whichever is greater. The annual time limit for these providers is up to 21 days (168 hours) per year or up to 48 days with prior approval. For APM -025 faculty, there is no annual earnings threshold, but they are limited to 48 days of OPAs per fiscal year. Additionally, OPAs are classified into three categories, each with various approval and annual reporting requirements. Category I. Real or perceived conflict of commitment because the activity relates to the expertise/training of the faculty member or requires a significant professional commitment. Category I activities require prior approval, but also have specific requirements for time limits, earning thresholds , and annual reporting (i.e., outside teaching, outside research or founding/co -founding a company). Category II. Less potential for a conflic t of commitment because the activity is generally shorter - term and is outside the course and scope of University employment. Category II activities do not require prior approval, but still have specific requirements for time limits, earning thresholds , and annual reporting (i.e., consulting, expert witness , or presenting at a workshop). Category III. Unlikely to raise a conflict of commitment because the activity is within the course and scope of University employment (i.e., reviewing manuscripts and presen ting talks at academic conferences). UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 115 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL OPAs can also involve activities where the faculty member has academic responsibility for a student. In that case, the faculty member must obtain written approval from the Department Chair before involving the student i n the OPA. Additionally, the faculty member is responsible for ensuring that the activity does not interfere with the student's academic obligations. OPAs must be reported annually on a fiscal year basis through the UC Outside Activity Tracking System (OATS). The OATS system can be found at https://ucdavis.ucoats.org/ and OATS training resources are available at https://academ icaffairs.ucdavis.edu/oats .

All healthcare personnel and visitors must use strict hand hygiene to prevent cross -transmission between patients, equipment , and environment. Use of hospital approved lotions and creams can preven t dryness from frequent hand hygiene. The World Health Organization promotes hand hygiene using the \"Five Moments of Hand Hy giene\" campaign. There are five key moments in healthcare when employees should perform hand hygiene : 1. Before touching a patient 2. Before clean/aseptic procedures 3. After body fluid exposure/risk 4. After touching a patient, and 5. After touching patient surround ings UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 116 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Use an Alcohol -Based Hand Sanitizer (Rub hands vigorously for 20 seconds) Wash with Soap and Water (Rub hands vigorously for 15 Seconds) Upon entrance to a patient room. Immediately before touching a patient Before performing an aseptic task (e.g., placing an indwelling device) or handling invasive medical devices Before moving from work on a soiled body site to a clean body site on the same patient After touching a patient or the patient's immediate environ ment After contact with blood, body fluids , or contaminated surfaces Immediately after glove removal When hands are visibly soiled After caring for a person with known or suspected infectious diarrhea After known or suspected exposure to spores (e.g. , B. anthracis, C . difficile outbreaks) Following glove removal if transdermal medications were handled (refer to UC Davis Health Policy 4039 ) The patient care area is considered the doorway , curtain line or imaginary line around the gurney in a hallway. This includes all areas where patient care is provided , e.g., bathroom, public area , or other place where the patient may be in need of assistance. For more information, please visit the hand hygiene webpage by typing \"hands /\" into the web browser address bar or refer to UC Davis Health Policy 11023 Hand Hygiene . Surgical hand scrub: Use UCDMC provided surgical hand preparation products found at the scrub sinks and water with brush to achieve friction for at least 120 seconds to remove or destroy transient microorganisms and reduce resident flora. Nails should be short and clean. Artificial nails are more likely than natural nails to harbor pathogens that can lead to healthcare acquired infections. Artificial nails, nail tips, acrylic overlays , and gel products are prohibited for all healthcare work ers who provide direct, hands -on patient care (i.e. , physical contact with a patient or patient's environment) or perform other tasks that require hand hygiene (i.e. , individuals that prepare sterile instruments or compound sterile pharmaceuticals). Nail polish without embedded enhancements may be worn but must be intact and free from chips, dings, wear , or any torn/rough areas. Gel nail polish is not acceptable currently due to lack of evidence demonstrating their safety. Use only hospital provided hand lotion while at work. Nail polish should not be chipped. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 117 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL To Glove or Not to Glove? Appropriate glove use is well -supported by evidence -based science. Wear gloves, according to Standard Precautions, when it can be reasonably anticipated that contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials, mucous membranes, non -intact skin, potentially contaminated skin , or contaminated equipment could occur. Gloves are not a substitute for hand hygiene. If your task requires gloves, perform hand hygiene prior to donning gloves, before touching the patient , or the patient environment. Perform hand hygiene immediately after removing gloves. Change gloves and perform hand hygiene during patient care if : Gloves become damaged , Gloves become visibly soiled with blo od or body fluids following a task, Moving from work on a soiled body site to a clean body site on the same patient, or If another clinical indication for hand hygiene occurs. Never wear the same pair of gloves in the care of more than one patient. Carefu lly remove gloves to prevent hand contamination. Gloves should be worn during patient transport when an employee anticipates contact with body fluids or open wounds. For example, it is appropriate to wear gloves to transport a trauma patient who is bleed ing or using a resuscitation bag on a patient during transport. It is appropriate to wear gloves during transport of a patient with burns (sterile gloves should be worn if burns will be touched). For all other circumstances, it is inappropriate to wear glo ves during patient transport. When transporting a patient who will need care and requires isolation precautions, there must be an additional transporter who is not wearing PPE. T his person may touch the environment (elevator buttons, door handles, etc.). A ll transporters wearing isolation PPE must avoid touching the hospital environment while transporting the patient in order to protect patients, visitors , and other hospital personnel. Refer to UC Davis Health Policy 11021 Transportation of Patient with Communicable Infection . Protecting visitors, other patients, and healthcare workers means glove s are not used to touch elevator buttons, or opening doors. Visitors touch buttons on elevators, doors , and door handles. It is inappropriate for staff (MDs, RNs, transporters, environmental services) to wear gloves while touching these items. Tier 1 - Standard Precautions UC Davis Health mandates the use of Standard and Transmission Based Precautions to protect all healthcare workers and patients from the transmission of infections as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control. The first tier of preca utions , or Standard Precautions , applies to the care of all UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 118 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL patients in all healthcare settings, regardless of the suspected or confirmed presence of an infectious agent. Standard Precautions include hand hygiene , use of any personal protective equipment ( PPE) (e.g. , gloves, gown, mask, eye protection, or face shield) needed to provide care based on anticipated risk , safe injection practices, and respiratory hygiene. PPE must also be considered when handling patients ' equipment, linen, care items , and surfa ces in the environment to prevent transmission of infectious agents (e.g. , wear gloves for direct contact, to contain heavily soiled equipment, and to properly clean and disinfect or sterilize reusable equipment before use on another patient). Guidelines f or Preventing Transmission of Infections in Healthcare Settings Perform Hand Hygiene . Use PPE whenever there is a possib ility of exposure to infectio us material . Ensure appropriate patient placement (isolation patients) . Properly handle, clean , and disinfect patient care equipment and instruments/devices. Clean and disinfect the environment appropriately . Activate any safety engineered sharp device immediately and discard into Sharps container. Never recap needles on a syringe. Tier II - Transm issio n-Based Precautions In addition to Standard Precautions, Tier II - Transmission -Based Precautions are used for patients with documented or suspected infections or colonization with highly transmissible or epidemiologically - important pathogens based on the route of transmission. The transmission -based precautions are as follows: Contact Precautions for those pathogens spread by direct and indirect contact with the patient or the patient's environment. Required PPE: Standard Precautions in addition to gloves and a gown. Droplet Precautions for those pathogens spread via droplets within 6 feet . Required P PE: Standard Precautions in addition to a mask and eye protection (goggles and face shield ). The healthcare worker must escalate respiratory protection to a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) (Preferred), elastomeric, or N95 respirator with eye protection for droplet precautions with any patients that are receiving aerosol -generating procedu res per UC Davis Health Policy 2002 Aerosol Transmissible Diseases Control Plan . Enhanced Contact/Droplet Precautions for COVID -19 and other novel resp iratory illnesses as determined by Infection Prevention , either suspected or confirmed. Required PPE : Standard Precautions in addition to a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR), elastomeric , or N95 respirator direct care and aerosol -generating procedures (PAPR preferred) , gloves , and gown. Precautions for those pathogens spread by tiny , aerosolized particles that are suspended in air for long distances. Required PPE: Standard Precautions in addition to a PAPR UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 119 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL (preferred) , elastomeric , or N95 respirator with eye protection (goggles or face shield ) and an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR). Contact Enteric Precautions for gastrointestinal bacterial or viral pathogens that are easily spread by direct contact with the patient or the patient's environment requiring hand washing with soap and water and the use of bleach for equipment and environmental cleaning. Required PPE: Standard Precautions in addition to gloves and a gown in addition to bleach cleaning. Refer to UC Davis Health Policy 11025 Standard and Transmission -Based Precautions for Infection Prevention and 11025 Attachment 3 Standard and Transmission Based Precaution Table for list of diseases requiring precautions. Airborne or Aerosol Transmissible Diseases (A TD) The Aerosol Transmissible Disease s Plan is found in the UC Davis Health Policy UC Davis Health Policy 2002 Aerosol Transmissible Disease Control Plan , which covers the regulatory text of the CAL/OSHA ATD Standard (Title 8, CCR Sections 5199) . This policy applies to all diseases transmitted via the airborne route and requires either Airborne Precautions (i.e., pulmonar y tuberculosis [TB], measles) or Droplet Precautions (i.e., influenza, pertussis). Identif y suspected symptomatic patients early and appropriately isolate immediately to prevent unprotected exposure. Exposures to patients with an A TD: If Infection Prevent ion determines that an exposure of a healthcare worker has occurred then Infection Prevention will notify the manager. The manager will prepare a list of exposed employees based on the exposure criteria and send the list to EHS. EHS will provide treatment and all follow -ups as indicated. Employees may also report exposures directly to EHS. The room must rest for at least one hour after discharge or transfer of a patient with Airborne precautions or a patient with Droplet precautions receiving aerosol genera ting procedures. While this period is often one hour it may be less depending on air exchanges in the room (to use a lesser time, EH&S and PO&M must have performed an assessment of the room's air exchanges and specifically communicated a shorter period). A ny staff that enter the room during the rest period must wear a PAPR or N95 mask. For example: Environmental Services staff may clean the room while wearing a gown, gloves, PAPR, elastomeric, or N95 respirator with eye protection while the room rests for o ne hour or designated rest time assigned by PO&M. A PAPR is worn when performing a high hazard procedure (aerosol generating procedure) on a patient with Airborne (i.e., TB patient) or Droplet precaution s (i.e., influenza) . High hazard procedures (listed i n the ATD Plan) include , but are not limited to, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, sputum induction, aerosolized administration of pentamidine or other medications, pulmonary function testing, and procedures in autopsy, surgery , or laboratory that may aerosolize pathogens. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 120 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Engineering Controls: An airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) is equipped with negative air pressure and air in the patient room is vented directly outdoors with a minimum of 12 air exchanges per hour. AIIR doors must be closed at all times while in use to ensure that the room remains in negative pressure (in rare instances, patient safety concerns, such as patients at risk for suicide, may necessitate some modification of this guidance . Consult with Infecti on Prevention as necessary). Audible alarms should be on so that an alarm will sound when the door is left open to the room or anteroom. Work Practice Controls: Prompt triage of patients requiring Airborne isolation is important. Follow hand washing polic ies. Using a PAPR is highly preferred or a fit -tested respirator. UCD H established a Respiratory Protection Policy to protect employees from airborne exposures to hazardous materials and biological agents that cannot be consistently controlled by work prac tices and/or engineering controls. All departments shall identify employees that are required to wear respiratory protection and ensure that it is worn properly . Personal Protective Equipment: The Aerosol Transmissible Diseases Plan mandates the use of NI OSH approved respirator s such as N95 or elastomeric respirator or a PAPR for protection against airborne pathogens . UC Davis Health workforce must be fit tested to wear a N95 or trained to use a PAPR. For N95 and elastomeric masks, fit testing must be performed annually (refer to UC Davis Health Policy 1603 Respiratory Protection ). PAPRs are designed t o provide better protection against airborne pathogens and aerosols, making it the first choice in respiratory protection when available. PAPRs are also used for healthcare workers who have facial hair that cannot be shaved for medical/religious reasons o r other issues that prevent a proper seal and for use with high hazard procedures. Respiratory protection is required for healthcare workers during airborne precaution patient transport . Staff who are working on a ventilation system that may contain airbor ne pathogens are required to wear respiratory protection . Gloves and gowns are worn to keep respiratory secretions away from clothing and skin. Dispose of PPE according to hospital policy. Vaccination : Influenza: All healthcare workers are required to par ticipate in the annual influenza vaccination program and provided the immunization free of charge. For more information of influenza, efficacy, safety, met hod of administration, and the benefits of being vaccinated , see the vaccination information sheet. For a list of other free vaccinations , please contact EHS. COVID: All healthcare workers who have an initial COVID vaccination series and a booster are up to date with current vaccination requirements at the time of this publication . The COVID -19 vaccination will be provided free of charge. For a list of other free vaccinations , please contact EHS. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 121 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Control of Tuberculosis Tuberculosis is a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis which is often spread via airborne transmission. In most individuals, Mycobacterium tuberculosis is contained by the host immune system, which is referred to as latent TB infection (LTBI). These individuals are asymptomatic and non -infectious. However, latent infection has the potential to develop into symptomatic infection (active TB) at any stage i n life, which is potentially life -threatening and also easily spread to others via airborne particles. Active TB is usually marked by pulmonary/respiratory symptoms as that is the primary location of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in the body. Commo n symptoms include fever, cough (including bloody cough), shortness of breath, unintended weight loss , and night sweats. Inpatients that are being ruled out for TB or who have active TB must have coordination and approval from county public health prior t o discharge or transfer. Environmental controls to prevent transmission of active tuberculosis are discussed above under the ATD plan . Employee screening, education , and treatment also play a large role in preventing the spread and development of active tu berculosis. All employees are screened for latent tuberculosis at -hire, usually with interferon -gamma release assay (IGRA) blood tests, though sometimes tuberculin skin tests are placed instead. If an employee who tests positive for LTBI at hire has not ta ken any medications for LTBI, it is very important for them to watch for the symptoms of active tuberculosis as noted above. For these employees, it is important to complete an annual symptom review which will be administered by Employee Health Services to ensure that there is no sign of progression to active tuberculosis. Employees with LTBI and risk factors for progression/re -activation include those with immunosuppression, including HIV, organ transplant, biologic medications, steroids , or other treatmen ts/conditions that weaken the immune system. If an employee with LTBI is interested in getting treatment to reduce the chance of progression to active TB by up to 90%, they can contact Employee Health Services to discuss treatment options. For employees who did not test positive for LTBI at -hire, it is important to be aware of risk factors for coming into contact with Mycobacterium tuberculosis . These include spending more than 30 days in a country with high rates of TB, which includes all c ountries except those in Western Europe, Northern Europe, Canada, Australia , and New Zealand. This also includes having close contact with anyone who has had active TB (both at work and in the community). Finally, it also includes time spent in a facility where TB is common, such as jail/prison, homeless shelters , or working in a health care facility in a country with high rates of TB. Employees without a history of LTBI who have any of these risk factors may contact Employee Health Services for voluntary T B testing to screen for LTBI. Employees should also report any exposure to active TB at work so they can have post -exposure testing and treatment if necessary. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 122 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Multidrug Resistant Organisms Multi -Drug Resistant Organisms (MDRO): MDROs are resistant to clas ses of antibiotics making them difficult to treat as well as a danger for transmitting infections in the hospital/community. Contact Isolation precautions may be required with specific MDROs , such lactamase producing organisms (ESBL) , among others . See UC Davis Health Policy 11025 Attachment 3 Standard and Transmission Based Precaution Table for a list of diseases requiring Standard or Transmission based precautions . Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is a pathogen that commonly causes infect ions in humans. MRSA is a variety of SA that has developed resistance to the common antibiotics used to treat SA infections. Important elements of the MRSA Control Program are as follows: Antimicrobial Stewardship Program to control the use of antibiotic s. A daily bath treatment with CHG (chlorhexidine gluconate) for all eligible patients is required to reduce the number of organisms (including MRSA) on patients' skin. Careful and frequent cleaning/disinfection of the patient's environment , which includes the patient's room and all equipment used by the patient. As mandated by California Senate Bill 1058 (Nile's Law), an anterior nares swab will continue to be obtained on each patient admitted looking for the presence of MRSA. Nurses are req uired to educate patients about MRSA and document this education in the EMR Patient Education Record. A MRSA brochure is available for patient education in multiple languages. Physicians are required to notify their patients of positive MRSA results. Refe r to UC Davis Health Policy 11015 MRSA Active Surveillance . NOTE: Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and MRSA patients are no longer routinely place d in Contact Precautions unless the patient has an infection , which has copious respiratory secretions or purulent wound drainage that cannot be contained in a dressing. Bloodborne Pathogens Exposure Control Plan (Hepatitis B, C, and HIV) The UC Davis Hea lth Bloodborne Pathogens Exposure Control Plan is located in UC Davis Health Policy 2001 and lists safety measures for preventing exposures to bloodborne pathogens such as Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) , which can cause severe disease and death. These pathogens are transmitted through contact with body fluids infected with the viruses, such as blood , semen, vaginal fluid, or any body fluids with blood present. OSHA and the UC Davis Health Bloodborne Pathogen Exposure Control Plan ( UC Davis Health Policy 2001 ) require prevention strategies to be followed to avoid contact with bloodborne pathogens in blood and other potential infectious material. The use of PPE (face shield, mask, goggles, gloves, and gowns), safety UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 123 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL devices , and activation of the safety feature of sharps to prevent sharp injuries are required prevention activities. NOTE : Lab coats and uniforms (scrubs) do NOT qualify as PPE because they are not impervious to fluids and cannot prevent direct contact with blood/ body fluids. Regular eyeglasses will not protect eyes from a splash exposure. Safety googles/face shields should be worn as appropriate to prevent splash exposures. Sharp Safety - Needle Resistant Glove Education Needle Resistant Gloves are necessary to pre vent needle or sharp injuries when searching all patient property . Gloves must be the appropriate size. Please use the Glove Sizing Guide when measuring hand to identify glove size. Clean Needle Resistant Gloves will be checked daily to ensure three pairs of small/medium/large are available . These gloves are only for staff who were not issued Needle Resistant Gloves . Notify Charge Nurse if no Needle Resistant Gloves available. Steps to Don Needle Resistant Gloves 1. Perform hand hygiene . 2. Select the appropri ately sized nitrile exam gloves. 3. Hold with one hand and insert the other. When the base of your thumb reaches the cuff of the glove begin to spread fingers and insert hand into glove. 4. Pull glove cuff towards wrist to cover as much skin as possible and secure glove. 5. Check to make sure there are no holes or tears. 6. Select appropriate size needle resistant gloves 7. Hold with one hand and insert the other. When the base of your thumb reaches the cuff of the glove begin to spread fingers and insert hand into gl ove. 8. Pull glove cuff towards wrist to cover as much skin as possible and secure glove. 9. Check to make sure there are no holes or tears. 5 Steps to Doff Needle Resistant Gloves 1. First remove one needle resistant glove by pulling away from your body. 2. While still wearing the nitrile glove , remove other needle resistant glove by pulling away from your body. 3. Place Needle Resistant Gloves in designated bin and wash hands before touching any other surfaces. 4. If the glove s were damaged or significantly soiled by blood/bodily fluids, place gloves in bin marked dirty/damage. 5. Used gloves will be inspected weekly for damage and cleaned prior to being placed on the unit. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 124 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Reporting Blood or Body Fluid Exposures An exposure to blood or body fluid occurs when UC Davis Health workforce receive a needle stick, puncture wound, or cut from any object contaminated with another person's blood or body fluid. An exposure occurs when patient's blood or body fluid comes into contact with an open wound, non -intact skin, or mucous membrane (eye, nose, and mouth). If UC Davis Health workforce sustains a blood/body fluid exposure, Employee Health Services will provide treatment and all follow -ups as indicated. First aid: Irrigate the contamination/wound site with water for 3 to 5 minutes. Do not squeeze or scrub the area. Do not go to the Emergency Department for treatment after sustaining an exposure unless there is also an injury that warrants ED care. Report: UC Davis Health workforce is responsible to report exposures to Emplo yee Health Services and fill out the incident report online by double clicking on the RL Solutions (Incident Reporting System) RLDatix computer desktop icon. The report is then recorded via the \"Employee Event\" icon. The reporting site can also be accessed online through the Employee Health webpage . The source patient lab slip is generated by completing the incident report . Health care worker follow -up labs are coordinated through Employee Health Services . Paper exposure report forms are to be used by pre -hospital personnel, which is coordinated by the Emergency Department. Call: Call Employee Health Bloodborne pathogen phone line at 916 -734-7585 to report pe rsonal exposure after having completed the exposure online . Leave a voicemail message if no one answers or if after hours . For after -hours high -risk exposure (known HIV + exposure) inquiries, call the Infectious Disease Fellow on -call. a) An Employee Health N urse will contact the exposed employee with the initial source patient lab results of the rapid HIV. After hours, the nursing supervisor or Infectious Disease Fellow will contact the employee with results. The Employee Health Nurse will also call when all source patient labs are completed to discuss a follow -up plan. b) All direct care providers are offered Hepatitis B vaccination at no cost. Currently there is no vaccine available for Hepatitis C. Refer to UC Davis Health Policy 2167 Bloodborne Pathogen Exposure s (Needlesticks, Sharps, and Splashes) for the procedure to follow in case of accidental contaminat ion with blood/body fluids. Antibiotic Stewardship The prompt initiation of antibiotics to treat infections has been shown to reduce morbidity and save lives. However, 30 - 50% of antibiotics prescribed in U.S. hospitals are inappropriate or unnecessary. T his has resulted in the development of multi -drug resistant organisms, which has become an ever - increasing problem. These organisms have made it difficult to treat infections effectively. They have also increased antibiotic usage such that this has become a major public health issue. Overuse of antibiotics UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 125 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL also contribute to increasing problems with Clostrid ioides difficile infections. Therefore, optimizing the use of antibiotics is important to patient safety and has become a national priority. For healthcare providers, it is important to: 1. Be notified immediately when the laboratory identifies drug -resistant infections in the patients. a. Use Antibiogram to know what patient drug -resistant infections are present in the facility . b. Prescribe antibiotics w isely, which includes, but is not limited to: i. Using the correct drug for as short a duration as possible . ii. Using antibiotic \"time outs,\" which prompts a reassessment of the continuing need and choice of antibiotics when the clinical picture is clearer and more diagnostic information is available. iii. Remove temporary medical devices , such as catheters and ventilators , as soon as they are no longer needed . Healthcare -Associated Infections (HAI) Clostridi oides difficile formerly called Clostridi um difficile ) In the United States in 2015, there were about half a million infections caused by Clostridium difficile (C. difficile , a spore -forming organism) and 15,000 patient deaths. Patients with C. difficile infection (CDI) can experience recurrent infections. Active CDI patients may have diarrhea, fever , abdominal pain, loss of appetite , and nausea. CDI is transmitted by contact with contaminated surfaces, hands of healthcare workers , or ingestion of C. diff icile spores , which are present i n both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. The risk for CDI increases in patient s with antibiotic exposure, proton pump inhibitors, gastrointestinal surgery/manipulation, long length of stay in healthcare settings, a ser ious underlying illness, immunocompromising conditions , and/or advanced age. However, there are increasing numbers of CDI being reported in low -risk people , such as healthy individuals in the community with no exposure to healthcare settings. Basic steps t o prevent CDI are: Use antibiotics judiciously. UC Davis Health has an active antibiotic stewardship program available to seek advice regarding antibiotic prescribing. Early identification and isolation for patients with known or suspected CDI: Use the CD I testing algorithm per UC Davis Health Policy 11033 Testing and Infection Prevention for Patients with Clostridium difficile for appropriate specimen col lection and testing for CDI. Symptomatic patients are placed in Contact Enteric Precautions immediately, pending test results. Hand Hygiene: Strict hand hygiene with soap and water is required as waterless alcohol hand hygiene products do not kill C. diff icile spores. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 126 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Cleaning: Thorough cleaning and disinfection of all environmental surfaces and reusable equipment is critical. At UC Davis Health, a two -step cleaning process is used with the first step performed with a hospital -approved disinfectant to clea n and remove any obvious contamination and C. difficile spores on surfaces. The second step is performed using a hospital - approved bleach product to both physically remove and kill any remaining spores that may be left behind after the initial step. Notifi cation of CDI to receiving facilities: If CDI patients are transferred to other facilities , ensure that appropriate history and treatment information is reported to the receiving facility. Device -related Infections Current healthcare practices use many typ es of invasive devices and procedures to treat patients , which can put patients at risk for infections. These healthcare -associated infections (HAIs) include central line - associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), catheter -associated urinary tract infect ions (CAUTIs), and ventilator -associated pneumonia (VAP). To prevent device related infections, UC Davis Health uses \"prevention bundles\" that are supported by evidence -based practice and have been found to be effective in preventing infection. The two most important points to remember are to utilize devices only when absolutely necessary and to remove all devices as soon as they are no longer needed. UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 127 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Appendices Appendix A: 20 23 National Patient Safety Goals The Joint Commission introduced the National Patient Safety Goal program in 2002 to reinforce the need for organizations to promote specific improvements in patient safety planning. The emphasis is on assessing, managing, monitoring, improving , and reporting patient safety related information and data. UC Davis Health has a strong, fundamental commitment to providing the highest level of safe, quality patient care.

Some goals and/or requirements have been retired, converted to standards, or are not appl icable to the hospital setting.] The goals are: Goal #1: Improve the Accuracy of Patient Identification NPSG.01.01.01 Use at least two patient identifiers when providing care, treatment, and services . (UC Davis Health Policy 2702 Patient Identification and Safety Bands for the Hospitalized Patient ), III.D.1). Before any procedure is carried out, the ident ification band shall be on the patient and will be checked for the following two identifiers to ensure that the correct patient is involved: a . patient name, b. patient medical record number. Label containers used for blood and other specimens in the prese nce of the patient. Use distinct methods of identification for newborn patients. Note: Examples of methods to prevent misidentification may include the following: Distinct naming systems could include using the mother's first and last names and the newbor n's gender (for example, \"Smith, Judy Girl\" or \"Smith, Judy Girl A\" and \"Smith, Judy Girl B\" for multiples). Standardized practices for identification banding (for example, using two body sites and/or bar coding for identification). Establish communication tools among staff (for example, visually alerting staff with signage noting newborns with similar names). *NPSG 01.03.01 - moved from NPSG section to standards section Goal #2: Improve the Effectiveness of Communication Among Caregivers NPS G.02.03.01 Report c ritical results of tests and diagnostic procedures on a timely basis : UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 128 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL (UC Davis Health Policy 2720 Communicating Critical Lab Values ; Radiology Policy 410 Radiology Exam Priorities ) Goal #3: Improve the Safety of Using Medications NPSG.03.04.01 Label all medicatio ns, medication containers (e.g. , syringe s, medicine cups, basins, etc. ), and other solutions on and off the sterile field in perioperative and other procedural settings : (UC Davis Health Polic y 3091 Labeling of Medications in Perioperative and Procedural Areas ) NPSG.03.05.01 Reduce the likelihood of patient harm with the use of anticoagulation therapy : (UC Davis Health Policy 4064 Anticoagulation Management Program; UC Davis Health Policy or Treatment of Thromboem bolism ) NPSG.03.06.01 Maintain and communicate accurate patient medication information : obtain medication information , document , and compare to resolve discrepancies , provide written information and education to the patient at discharge or end of encounter.

(UC Davis Health Policy 4072 Observation of the Suicidal, Agitated, Behaviorally Difficult, and High Safety Risk Hospitalized Patient ) UC D avis Health Mandatory Annual Training Manual 20 23 129 Version: January 202 3 - FINAL Universal Protocol for Preventing Wrong Site, Wrong Procedure, and Wrong Person Surgery The Universal Protocol applies to all surgical and nonsurgical invasive procedures. Evidence indicates that procedures that place the patient at the most risk include those that involve general anesthesia or deep sedati on, although other procedures may also affect patient safety. Hospitals can enhance safety by correctly identifying the patient, the appropriate procedure, and the correct site of the procedure. The Universal Protocol is based on the following principles: - Wrong -person, wrong -site, and wrong -procedure surgery can and must be prevented. - A robust approach using multiple, complementary strategies is necessary to achieve the goal of always conducting the correct procedure on the correct person, at the correct site. - Active involvement and use of effective methods to improve communication among all members of the procedure team are important for success. - To the extent possible, the patient and, as needed, the family are involved in the process. - Consistent implement ation of a standardized protocol is most effective in achieving safety. UP.01.01.01 Conduct a Pre -procedure Verification Process : Implement a p re-procedure verification process to verify the correct procedure, for the correct patient at the correct site. UP.01.02.01 Mark the Procedure Site: The procedure site is to be marked with as much involvement by an awake/aware patient as possible. UP.01.03.01 A Time -Out (Surgical Pause) is Performed before the Procedure : Immediately PRIOR to skin incision, the entir e team will actively participate in a time -out during which key information regarding the surgery/procedure and patient will be verified.
