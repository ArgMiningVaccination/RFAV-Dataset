Our goal is to provide broader immunity against COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, including Omicron and other circulating strains.\" For the analyses, sera were drawn before (baseline) and one month after administration of a 30-\u00b5g booster dose (fourth dose) of the companies' Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine. A subset of individuals, evenly stratified between those who had evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and those who did not, was selected for ages 18 to 55 years (n=38) and older than 55 years and older (n=36). A comparator group of participants older than 55 years of age (n=40) who received a 30-\u00b5g booster dose (fourth dose) of the companies' original COVID-19 vaccine as part of a prior study was randomly selected, while ensuring the same equal stratification. Participants receiving the bivalent vaccine had their prior booster dose approximately 10-11 months earlier, whereas those who received the original vaccine had their prior booster dose approximately 7 months earlier. Despite this difference, pre-booster antibody titers were similar for both. Among the overall study population who received the Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine, there was a substantially higher increase in Omicron BA.4/BA.5-neutralizing antibody titers compared to pre-booster levels. For individuals 18 to 55 years of age, the geometric mean titer (GMT) against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 was 606, representing a 9.5-fold rise (95% CI: 6.7, 13.6) from pre-booster levels. For individuals older than 55 years, the GMT was 896, representing a 13.2-fold rise (95% CI: 8.0, 21.6) from pre-booster levels. By contrast, participants over 55 years of age who received a 30-\u00b5g booster dose of the companies' original COVID-19 vaccine had a lower neutralizing antibody response against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 measured one month post booster. For these participants, the GMT was 236, representing a 2.9-fold rise (95% Omicron BA.4/BA.5 antibody titers were approximately 4-fold higher for the bivalent vaccine compared to the companies' original Covid-19 vaccine in individuals over 55 years of age. Further, when examining those with or without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection who received a booster dose of the bivalent vaccine, there was a significant increase in neutralizing antibodies against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 in both groups, which was greater in those without prior infection. These data highlight the potential benefit of the bivalent vaccine for all populations regardless of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The safety profile remains favorable for the bivalent vaccine and consistent with the original vaccine. Pfizer and BioNTech have shared these data with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and plan to share with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other global health authorities as soon as possible. A booster dose of the BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine has been authorized for emergency use by the FDA for ages 5 years and older and has also been granted marketing authorization in the EU by the European Commission following a positive opinion from the EMA for ages 12 years and older. An application for marketing authorization of the BA.4/BA.5 booster has been submitted to the EMA for children ages 5 through 11. Separately, Pfizer and BioNTech are continuing to monitor immunogenicity of the BA.4/BA.5 bivalent booster against emerging Omicron subvariants. The companies also initiated a Phase 1/2/3 [trial in September 2022](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pfizer.com%2Fnews%2Fpress-release%2Fpress-release-detail%2Fpfizer-and-biontech-submit-application-us-fda-emergency-0&esheet=52960873&newsitemid=20221103006400&lan=en-US&anchor=trial+in+September+2022&index=5&md5=9b7f68263d9632ec271a41d85a43d545), in September 2022, to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of different and dosing regimens of the companies' Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine among children 6 months through 11 years of age. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccines (COMIRNATY\u00ae), which are based on BioNTech's proprietary mRNA technology, were developed by both BioNTech and Pfizer. BioNTech is the Marketing Authorization Holder for BNT162b2 Wild Type and BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and other countries, and the holder of emergency use authorizations or equivalents in the United States (jointly with Pfizer) and other countries. Submissions to pursue regulatory approvals in those countries where emergency use authorizations or equivalent were initially granted are planned.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5), COMIRNATY\u00ae (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Tell your vaccination provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: - have any allergies - have had myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) or pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) - have a fever - have a bleeding disorder or are on a blood thinner - are immunocompromised or are on a medicine that affects the immune system - are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding - have received another COVID-19 vaccine - have ever fainted in association with an injection - The vaccine may not protect everyone - You should not get COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA), the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, or the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent if you have had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of COMIRNATY or the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or any ingredient in these vaccines - There is a remote chance that these vaccines could cause a severe allergic reaction. A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to 1 hour after getting a dose of the vaccine. For this reason, your vaccination provider may ask you to stay at the place where you received the vaccine for monitoring after vaccination. If you experience a severe allergic reaction, call 9-1-1 or go to the nearest hospital Seek medical attention right away if you have any of the following symptoms: difficulty breathing, swelling of the face and throat, a fast heartbeat, a bad rash all over the body, dizziness, and weakness - Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) have occurred in some people who have received COMIRNATY\u00ae (COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA) or Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. The observed risk is higher among adolescent males and adult males under 40 years of age than among females and older males, and the observed risk is highest in males 12 through 17 years of age. In most of these people, symptoms began within a few days following receipt of the second dose of vaccine. The chance of having this occur is very low Side effects that have been reported with these vaccines include: - Severe allergic reactions - Non-severe allergic reactions such as rash, itching, hives, or swelling of the face - Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) - Pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) - Injection site pain - Tiredness - Headache - Muscle pain - Chills - Joint pain - Fever - Injection site swelling - Injection site redness - Nausea - Feeling unwell - Swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) - Decreased appetite - Diarrhea - Vomiting - Arm pain - Fainting in association with injection of the vaccine - Unusual and persistent irritability - Unusual and persistent poor feeding - Unusual and persistent fatigue or lack of energy - Unusual and persistent cool, pale skin These may not be all the possible side effects of the vaccine. Call the vaccination provider or healthcare provider about bothersome side effects or side effects that do not go away. Individuals should always ask their healthcare providers for medical advice about adverse events.

the risk that preclinical and clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments, including during the peer review/publication process, in the scientific community generally, and by regulatory authorities; whether and when additional data from the BNT162 mRNA vaccine program will be published in scientific journal publications and, if so, when and with what modifications and interpretations; whether regulatory authorities will be satisfied with the design of and results from these and any future preclinical and clinical studies; whether and when submissions to request emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations for BNT162b2 in additional populations, for a potential booster dose for BNT162b2, any monovalent or bivalent vaccine candidates or any potential future vaccines (including potential future annual boosters or re-vaccinations), and/or other biologics license and/or emergency use authorization applications or amendments to any such applications may be filed in particular jurisdictions for BNT162b2, any monovalent or bivalent vaccine candidates or any other potential vaccines that may arise from the BNT162 program, including a potential variant-based, higher dose, or bivalent vaccine, and if obtained, whether or when such emergency use authorizations or licenses will expire or terminate; whether and when any applications that may be pending or filed for BNT162b2 (including any requested amendments to the emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations), any monovalent or bivalent vaccine candidates (including the submission pending with the EMA for the BA.4/BA.5 booster for children ages 5 through 11 and any other potential submissions for the Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine), or other vaccines that may result from the BNT162 program may be approved by particular regulatory authorities, which will depend on myriad factors, including making a determination as to whether the vaccine's benefits outweigh its known risks and determination of the vaccine's efficacy and, if approved, whether it will be commercially successful; decisions by regulatory authorities impacting labeling or marketing, manufacturing processes, safety and/or other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of a vaccine, including development of products or therapies by other companies; disruptions in the relationships between us and our collaboration partners, clinical trial sites or third-party suppliers; the risk that demand for any products may be reduced or no longer exist which may lead to reduced revenues or excess inventory; risks related to the availability of raw materials to manufacture a vaccine; challenges related to our vaccine's formulation, dosing schedule and attendant storage, distribution and administration requirements, including risks related to storage and handling after delivery by Pfizer; the risk that we may not be able to successfully develop other vaccine formulations, booster doses or potential future annual boosters or re-vaccinations or new variant-based or next generation vaccines; the risk that we may not be able to maintain or scale up manufacturing capacity on a timely basis or maintain access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand for our vaccines, which would negatively impact our ability to supply the estimated numbers of doses of our vaccines within the projected time periods; whether and when additional supply agreements will be reached; uncertainties regarding the ability to obtain recommendations from vaccine advisory or technical committees and other public health authorities and uncertainties regarding the commercial impact of any such recommendations; challenges related to public vaccine confidence or awareness; uncertainties regarding the impact of COVID-19 on Pfizer's business, operations and financial results; and competitive developments.
