It is also well documented that there is a close interplay between physical fitness and exertion and immune function and dysfunction. The balancing act of living a healthy and vital life while tending to mitochondrial nutrition and performance is paramount. Our discussion will include signs that other tissues and organs may be pointing towards a weakened-susceptible mitochondrial status in the body. Both NAD+ and ATP levels diminish significantly with biological aging raising the clinical question of the central role of both molecules in accelerated aging. Learning Points: - Addressing saboteurs to optimal mitochondrial function - Current Research on the role of NAD and mitochondrial support for muscular performance - Aging and the critical role of sustained muscle strength for longevity - Consequences of over-training relative to mitochondrial deficits Speaker Dr. Chris D.
