EPILOGUE APPENDIX Acknowledgments Other Books by the Authors Index P R E F A C E b y S a l l y F a l l o n M o r e l l Since the dawn of the human race, medicine men and phys icians have wondered about the cause of dis ease, especially what we call \"contagions.\" Numerous people become ill with similar symptoms, all at the same time. Does humankind suf fer these ou tbreaks at the hands of an angry god or evil spirit? A disturb ance in the atmo sphere? A miasma? Do we catc h the illness from others or from some outside influence? W ith the invention of the mic roscope in 1670 and the disco very of bacteria, doctors had a new candidate to blame: tiny one-celled or ganisms that hum ans cou ld pass from on e to another through contact and exhalation. But the germ th eory of disease did not take hold until two hundred years later with celebrity scientist Lou is Pasteur and soon became the explanation for most illness. Recognition of nutritional def iciencies as a cause of diseases like scurvy , p ellagra, and beriberi took decades because the germ theory became the expl anation for everything that ails the human being. As Robert R. W illiams, one of the discoverers of thiamine (vitamin B1) lamented, \"all young physician s were so imbued with the idea of infection as the cause of disease that it presently came to be accepted as almost axi omatic that disease c ould have no other caus e [other than microbes]. The preoccupation of p hysicians with infection as a cause of disease was doubtless responsible for many digressions from attention to food as the causa l factor of beriberi.\"1 During the Spanish flu pandem ic of 1918, the deadliest exam ple of a contagion in recent history , doctors struggled to explain the worldwide reach of the illn ess. It sickened an estimated five hundred millio n people\u2014 about on e-third of the planet' s population\u2014and killed betwee n twenty to fifty mil lion people. It seemed to appear spontaneously in dif fe rent parts of the world, striking the young and healthy , including many American servicemen. So me communities shut down schools, businesses, and theaters; people were ordered to wear masks and refrain from shaking hands, to stop the contagion. But was it contagious? Health of ficials in those days believed that the cause of the Spanish flu was a m icroor ganism called Pfeiffer ' s bacillus, and they were interested in the question of how the or ganism could spread so quickly . T o answer that quest ion, doctors from the US Pu blic Health Service tried to infect one hundred healthy volunteers between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five by collecting mucous secretions from the noses, throats, and upper respiratory tracts of those who were s ick.2 They transferred thes e secretions to the noses, mouths, and lungs of the volunteers, but not one of them succumbed; blood of sick donors was injected into the blood of the volunteers, but they remained stubbornly healthy; finally they instructed those af flicted to breathe and cou gh over the healthy volunteers, but the results were the same: the Spanish flu was not contagious, and physicians could attach no blame to the accused bacterium. Pasteur believed that the healthy human body was sterile and became sick only when invaded by bacteria\u2014a view that dominated the practice of medicine for over a century . In recent years we have witnessed a complete reversal of the reigning medic al paradigm\u2014that bacteria att ack us and make us sick. W e have learned that the digestive tract of a hea lthy person contains up to six pounds of bacteria, which play many beneficial roles\u2014 they pro tect us against toxins, support the immune system, help digest our food, create vitamins, and even produce \"feel good\" chemicals. Bacteria that coa t the skin and line the vaginal tract play equally protective roles. These discoveries call into question many current medical practices\u2014from antibiotics to hand washing. Indeed, researchers have become increasingly frustrated in their attempts to prove that bacteria make us sick, except as coactors in extremely unnatural conditions. Enter viruses: Louis Pasteur did not find a bacterium that could cause rabies a nd speculated about a pathogen too small for detection by microscopes. The first images of these tiny particles\u2014about one-thousandth the size of a cell\u2014were obta ined upon the invention of t he electron microscope in 1931. These virus es\u2014from the Latin virus for \"toxin\"\u2014were immediately ass umed to be dan gerous \"infectious agents.\" A virus is not a living or ganism that can reproduce on its own, but a collection of proteins and snippets of DNA or RNA enclosed in a membrane. Since th ey are seen in and around li ving cells, researchers assumed that viruses replicate only inside th e living cells of an or ganism. The belief is that these ubiquitous viruses \"can infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microor ganisms, including bacteria and archaea.\"3 Dif ficult to separate and purify , viruses are a convenient scape goat for diseases that don' t fit the bacterial model. Colds, flu, and pneumonia, once considered exclusively bacterial diseases, are now often blamed on a virus. Is it possible that scientists will one day discover that these pa rticles, like the once -maligned bacteria, pla y a beneficial role? Indeed, sci entists have already done just that, but old ideas, especially ideas that pro mise profits from drugs and vaccines\u2014the \"one bug, one drug\" mentality\u2014die hard. T oday , the premise that coronavirus is contagious and can cause disease has provided the justification for putting entire nations on lockdown, destroying the global economy and throwing hundreds of thousands out of work. B ut is it c ontagious? Can one person give coronavirus to others and make them sick? Or is someth ing else, some outside influence, causing illness in the vulnerable? These questions are bound to make public health of ficials uncomfortable\u2014even angry\u2014be cause the whole thrust of modern medicine derives from the premis e that microor ganisms\u2014transmittable microor ganisms\u2014cause disease . From antibiotics to vaccines, from face masks to social distancing, most people submit willingly to such measures in order to protect themselves and others. T o question the underlying principle of contagion is to question the foundation of medical care. I am del ighted t o join my collea gue T om Cowan in creating this expos\u00e9 of the modern m edical myth\u2014that microor ganisms cause disea se and that these di seases can be spread fr om one person to another through coughs, sneezes, kisses, and hugs. Like T om, I am no stranger to controversial views. In my book Nourishing T raditions , fir st published in 1996, I proposed the heretical idea that cholesterol and saturated animal fats are not villains, but essential components of the diet, necessary for normal growth, mental and physical well-being, and the prevention of disease. In Nourishing T raditions and in other writings, I presented the radical notion that pasteurization\u2014colla teral damage of the germ theory\u2014destroys the good ness in milk and that ra w whole milk is both safe and therapeutic, especially important for growing children. It is the most obvious substitute for brea st milk when mothers are having trouble nursing the ir babies, a proposition that makes health of ficials squirm. In subsequent publications I have ar gued the dissenting view that it is a nutrient-dense diet and not the administration o f vaccines that best protects our children from i llness. Over the years these views have found increasing support with both laypeople and health professionals. Error ha s conseq uences. The result of the notion that our diets sh ould be devoid o f anima l fats, that childr en should grow up on processed skim milk, and that it' s fine to vaccinate them dozens of times before the age of five has resulted in i mmense suf fering in our children, an epidemic of chronic illness in adults, and a serious decline in the quality of our f ood supply .There are economic consequences as well, including the devastation of rural life as small farms, especially dairy farms prohibited from selling their milk directly to customers, give in against the price pressures of \"Big Ag\" (Big Agriculture/corporate farming), and parents of children with chronic illness (estimated to be as high as one child in six4) s trugg le with the costs of caring for them. What are the possible consequences of the premise that microor ganisms, especially viruses, cause disease? The \"coronavirus pandemic\" gives us many clues: forced vaccinations, mic rochipping, prescribed social distancing, lockdown, mandatory masks, and negation of our righ t to assemble and practice our religion whenever an illness appears that can be media hyped into a public health emer gency . Until we base our public policie s on the truth, the situation will only get worse. T he truth is that contagion is a myth; we need to look el sewhere for the caus es of disease. Only when we do so will we create a world of freedom, prosperity , and good health. \u2014Sally Fallon Morell July 2020 I N T R O D U C T I O N by Thomas S. Cowan, MD I am no stranger to controversial views, particularly controversial positions in the field of medicine. In my latest series of three boo ks, I have denounced seve ral sacred icons that form the basis of our attitu des toward disease and its treatment. In Human Heart, Cosmic Heart , I clearly demonstrated that the heart is not a pu mp and that blocked arteries are not the predominant ca use of heart attacks. Then, in V accines, Autoimmunity , and the Changing Natur e of Childhood Illness , I proposed the theory that acu te illness is not caused by an i nfection that attacks us f rom the outside but rather represents a cleansing of our watery , cellular gels. A corollary to this position is that any intervention that interferes with this cleansing response, in particular vaccines, is bound to create u ntold harm that manifests in s kyrocketing rates of chronic disease. In what I thoug ht would be my third and final book, Cancer and the New Bio logy of W ater , I show why the \"war on cance r\" is an utter failure. I ar gue that the m odern chemotherapeutic approach to cancer is useless and that an entirely new way of looking at this problem must emer ge. I postulated that this new way of looking at medicine and biology must put the question of \" what actually causes disease\" squarely in the fore-front of our thinking.I thought I was done with writing controversial books (at least about medicine) and that I could turn my attention to finishing out my career as a practicing physician; spending more time in the garden; and creating a healing place for myself, my friends, and my family . I knew I would continue doing occasional interviews and maybe some online classes or mentoring. I would still talk about the nature of water and the increasing pollution of our earth; but I also hoped that interest in my work would wane and simply become part of th e general consciousness, a new way of thinking that would change our attitude toward disease and rehumanize the practice of medicine. I did have a nagging thought\u2014which had been there for years\u2014that I needed to delve into the HIV/AIDS af fair , but I was content to let t hat be\u2014it was more like an itch that only occasionally begged to be scratched. Not long ago I had lunch with a homeopathic physician, and we were joking about our respective long careers in medicine, and how much things have cha nged over the years. For some reason, the conversatio n turned to immunology , an d we asked each other what we remembered learning in medical school about immunology\u2014that was back in the early 1980s. W e both jok ingly concluded that the only thing we remember was being taught that if you wanted to know whether a patient was immune to a particular viral disease, you could test antibody levels. If the antibodies were high, that meant they were immune. Just as people remember for the rest of their lives the moment they heard th at JFK was shot, or abo ut the W orld T rade Center tow ers coming down on September 1 1, I have a vivid memory of h earing the announcement b y Robert Gallo in 1984 that they had found t he cause of AIDS. It was caused by a virus called HIV , and the reason they knew it caused A IDS is that they found elevated antibody levels in so me (not all) AIDS pa tients. I remember turning to a fellow medical student at the time and saying, \"Hey , who changed the rules?\" In other words, after havingspent the previo us four years lea rning that people with antibodies to a virus were immune to that particular virus, we were now being told\u2014with no explanation whatsoever\u2014that antibodies meant that the virus was actually causing the disease! I did n' t buy it then, and I don' t buy it now . For more than th irty-five years, I have re ad countless articles, books, papers, and documents about the lack of connection between HIV and AIDS. This naturall y led me to investigate the connection between \"viruses\" and other diseases, and what I discovered was shocking, to say the least. That is the background of my now-famous ten-minute video about the cause of the coronavirus \"pandemic.\" Even tho ugh I have been aware for decades that the virus king is naked, I w as hoping that others would take up the challenge to relay this information to the general public. But a ten-minute video thrust me onto the stage. It happened like this: in early 2020, I received an invitation to speak at a health conference in Arizona. I knew almost nothing about the group that invi ted me, but they gave me a first-class airplane ticket, so I agreed. I wasn' t clear on w hat topic they wanted me to speak, but since I never speak with slid es or notes, I figured I would improvise, as usual. Int erestingly , a few time s in the weeks leading up to this event my wife asked me where I was goi ng, to whom I was speaking, and what the subject was. I just shrugged and said they seemed like nice, earnest people. A few weeks ea rlier , the whole \"coronavirus\" event started to dominate the news. At first, I didn' t think much of it, figuring that th is was just another in a long line of viral s cares\u2014remember SARS, MERS, avian flu, Ebola, swine flu, and Zika? Th ese were going to kill us all, b ut then just faded away . But with \"coronavirus,\" things started to intensify , particularly the dramatic, draconian responses b y the authorities. Still, I didn' t think much about it, although I did wonder whether the illnesses were the initialconsequences of the planned 5G rollout\u2014or perhaps a cover -up for the rollout. I thought about skipping the conference in Arizona, mo stly because I was afraid of being quarantined there and not allowed to return home. I decided I was being paranoid an d that I might as well honor my agreement to speak. When I arrived at the conference, I discovered that there were only twenty o r thirty attendees. The three other speakers had all canceled or decided to do th eir talks via Sky pe or Zoom. I was scheduled to do one talk each day of the two-day conference. The first day' s talk was on acute illness and vaccines (my usual stump s peech on that subject), with a talk on heart disease on the second day . That nig ht we started to hear more about quarantines and grounded planes. G iven th e sparse attendance, I spent part of that first night online to see whether I co uld catch an ea rlier flight home and just skip my second talk. I slept fitfu lly , worried about whether I should catch the 7 a.m. flight instead o f my scheduled 1 p.m. flight. I decided that was crazy , and as long as I was there, I would do my talk on the heart and maybe end with a few comments about \"viruses\" and the current situation. T o say I didn' t know I was bein g taped is not accurate, as I obviously wore a microphone and a guy in the back of the room seemed to be filming me, at least some of the time. But in my mind, I was clearly speaking to that group of twenty or thirty people . At the end of the talk, I made a few of f- the-cuf f remarks about why viruses do not cause illness. I said m y piece and left for the airport. I was one of ten or so people on the plane, and I made it safely home, very glad to be there. A fe w d ays later , I got an email from Josh Coleman, the guy wh o filmed the v ideo, saying he had posted my remarks on viruses somew here online, and it was getting a huge respon se.1 I thought that this might be interesting but not much m ore. The rest, a s they say , is history . I have no idea how widely c irculated that ten-minu te video has become or how many people have seen it\u2014Josh tells me that it has had more than one million views. I only kne w that I needed to spe ak more about this subject, eve n if only to clarify what I had said at the conference. Interest in my comments came from people all over the world. Overnight I had become the point person for an alternative view of viruses, the g erm theory , the current hea lth situation, and a lot more. This led to a few podcast interviews, includin g one with Sayer Ji on GreenMedInfo.com , and my own webinars. Of c ourse, I was criticized and even received some shocking thr eats, but I h ave also received support in ways I could never have imagin ed. I meant no harm to anyone. I am one man with a certain perspective, hopefully correct in some things\u2014and, if incorrect in other things, I ask my readers only to understa nd that any errors come out of a place of seeking the truth and my ability to understand the situation. T wo things press me forward. T he first is to make it possible f or all of us to live in a world where everyone can speak their minds and hearts freely without fear of recrimination or abuse. What could possibly be wrong with having an open and honest deba te about the nature and cause of illness and disease? This is a complex ques tion, and no one person or group has all the answers. But isn' t that what real science, as opposed to scientism, is supposed to be about? Second, I am concerned that if my understanding of the current situation is ev en close to correct\u2014an understanding for which we inten d to make a clear and convincing case in these pages\u2014then humanity is at a crossroads right now . There will be profoun d, even unimaginable conseque nces for all life on earth if w e fail to heed the messages that emer ge from the current situation. My contention is that if we fail to understand the true causes of the \"coronavirus pandemic,\" we will go down a bitter path from which there will be no turning back. That is what is driving me to write this book. I am hap py to be writing this b ook with fellow iconoclast Sally Fallon Morell. Sally and I have been f riends, collaborators (this is our third book together), and (I dare say) spiritual partners for over two decades. W ith a small contributio n from me, Sally founded the W eston A. Price Foundation in 1999, perhaps the single best resource available for bringing truth in food, medicine, and farming to a world starving for that truth. I sincere ly wish this to be the last book Sally and I work on together . W e have enjoyed collaborating, but I expect that the current \"pa ndemic\" we are living through will be a profound turning point in the history of humanity . It is my hope that out of this event, a new way of life will emer ge in a world free of poisoned food, poisoned water , and the poisonous and false germ theory . In this world, I envision no need for Sally and myself to write books. People w ill just know how to liv e; they will know that to poison their food, water , a ir , and the electric sheath of the earth is something on ly madmen can contemplate. W e both look forward to the day when we can for get about w arning p eople about this or that and spend more time g rowing and cooking food and sharing it in joy and laughter with our famil ies, friends, and neig hbors. N o more books; after this, dear friends, you will know all you need to know . Buckle up, folks, we are in for the ride of our lives. \u2014Thomas S. Cowan, MD July 2020PART 1 EXPOSING THE GERM THEORYCHAPTER 1 C O N T A G I O N Let' s get right to the nitty-gritty of this issue: contagion. How do we know whether any set of symptoms has an infectious cause? As we can all imagine, determining the cause of a disease in general, or a set of symptoms in any particula r person, can be a complex and dif ficult task. Obviously , there are many factors to be considered for any one person at any one time in hi s or her life. Are the sympto ms a result of genetics, poisoni ng, bad diet and nutrient deficiencies, stress, EMFs, negative emotions, placebo or nocebo ef fects\u2014or infection from another person by a bacteria or virus? In findin g our way through this morass, we need well-defined rules to determine how to prove causation\u2014and these rules should be clear , simple, and corr ect. W e do have such rules, but scientists have ignore d them for years. U nfortunately , failure to follow these guidelines threaten s to destroy the fabric of society . Imagine that an inventor calls y ou up and says he has invented a new ping-pong ball that is able to k nock down brick walls and the refore make the p rocess of demolition much easier and safer for builders and carpenters. Sounds interesti ng, although it is hard to imagine how a pin g-pong ball could do such a thing. Y ou as k the inventor to show you how he has determined that the new ping-po ng balls are able to destroy brick walls. His company sends you a video. The video shows them putting a pin g-pong ballin a bucket of rocks and ice cubes. They then take the bucket and fling it at a small brick wall. The wall goes down\u2014\"there' s the proof,\" they say . W ait a minute! How do we know it was the ping-pong ball that knocked the wall down and not the rocks and ice cubes that were also in the bucket? \"Good question ,\" the inventor replies and then sends you a video showing an animated or virtual ping-pong ball destroying a virtual brick wall. He lets you know that the ball and the wall are exact renditions of the actual ball and brick. Still, something doesn' t seem right; after all, it' s fairly easy to create a computer image or video that shows such an occurrence, yet we would all agree it has not hing to do with what might happen with the actual ball and wall. The inventor is getting exasper ated with all your questions, b ut since you are a potential investor and he is interested in having yo ur financial support, he persists. He then sends you a detailed analysis of what makes his ping -pong b all special. It ha s special protrusions on the ou tside of the ball that \"grab onto and destroy the integrity of the cement holding the bricks together .\" Also, they build a lightweight internal system in the ping- pong ball that, according to the inventor , leverages the power of the ball, making it hundreds of times more powerful than the usual ping-pong ball. This, he says, is absolute proof that the new ball can whack down walls. At th is p oint, yo u are ready to hang up on this lunatic, but then he pulls the final trump card. He sends you videos of five esteemed researchers in the new field o f ping-pong ball demolition. They , of course, have been funded entirely by the Ping-Pong Ball Demolition Council and have attained prestigious positions in the field. They each sepa rately give testimony about the interesting qualities of this new ping-pong ball. They admit th at more research is nee ded, but they have \"presumptive\" evidence that the claims of improved e f ficiency are correct and that a cautious investment is warranted. At that point, you do hang up the phon e and check1. 2. 3.outside to see w hether you've been dropped into Alice' s W onderland, and whether you have just been talking to the Mad Hatter . Now if this pin g-pong ball can really knock down brick w alls, the obvious thing to do is to take the ping-pong ball, throw it at the wall, and record what happens\u2014then have multiple other non-invested people do the same to make sure the company didn' t put lead in the ball and throw it at a wall ma de of paper bricks. W e could call this the Ultimate Pin g-Pong Ball T est (UPPBT). As biza rre and crazy as it sounds, this lack of evidence\u2014that a microor ganism called coronavirus pulls down the wall of yo ur immune system, invades your cells, and starts replicating in them\u2014is exactly w hat has happened with the \"coronavirus\" pandemic. No one has bot hered to see what ha ppens if you do the UPPBT , throwing the ball against the wall\u2014 and if you even suggest that we should do this, the trolls emer ge from the shadows to call you a crazy person spreading \"fake news.\" Most people would agree with t he requirement of proving that t he ping- pong ba ll can destroy the brick wall; it' s not something any of us would consider negotia ble.. And most people would agree that seeing a real brick wall dem olished by a ping-pong ball constitutes proof. In other words, sane, rational human beings would accept the above UPPBT as true and relevant. Heinrich Hermann Robert Koch (1843-1910) is considered on e of the founders of modern bacteriology; he created and improved laboratory technologies for isolating bacteria and also developed techniques for photographing bacteria. His r esearch led to the creation of Koch' s postulates, a kind of UPPBT fo r disease, which consist of fou r principles linking specific microor ganisms to specific diseases. Koch' s postulates are as follows: The microor ganism must be found in abundance in all or ganisms suf fering from the disease but not found in healthy or ganisms. The microor ganism must be isolated from a diseased or ganism and grown in a pure culture. The cultured microor ganism should cause disease when introduced into a healthy or ganism.4. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.The microor ganism must be re-isolated from the now diseased experimental host which received the inoculation of the microor ganisms and identified as identical to the original specific causative agent. If all four condit ions are met, you have proven the infectious cause for a specific set of symptoms. This is the only way to prove causation. Interestingly , even Koch could not find proof of contagion using his postulates. He abandoned the r equirement of the first postulate when he discovered carriers of cholera and typhoid fever who did not get sick.1 In fact, bacteriologists and virologists today believe that Koch' s sensible and logical postulates \"have been recognized as lar gely obsolete by epidemiologists since the 1950s.\"2 Koch' s p ostulates are for bacteria, not for viruses, which are about one thousand times smaller . In the la te nineteenth century , the first evidence for the e xistence of these tiny partic les came from experiments with filters that had pores small enough to retain bacteria and let other particles through. In 1937, Thomas Rivers mo dified Koch' s postulates in order to determine the infectious nature of viruses. Rivers' postulates are as follows: The virus can be isolated from diseased hosts. The virus can be cultivated in host cells. Proof of filterability\u2014the virus can be filtered from a medium that also contains bacteria. The filtered virus will produce a comparable disease when the cultivated virus is used to infect experimental animals. The virus can be re-isolated from the infected experimental animal. A specific immune response to the virus can be detected. Please note that Rivers drops Koch' s first postulate\u2014that' s because many p eople suf fering from \"viral\" illness do not harbor the of fending microor ganism. Even with Koch' s first postulate missing, researchers have not been able to prove that a sp ecific virus causes a specific disease using Rivers' postulates; one study claims that Rivers' postulates have been met for SARS, said to be a viral dis ease, but careful examination of this paper demonstrates that none of the postulates have been satisfied.3 Again, this book' s central claim is that no disease attributed to bacteria or viruses has met all of Koch' s postulates or all of Rivers' criteria. This is not b ecause the postulates are incorrect or obsolete (in fact, they are entirely logical) but rather because bacteria and viruses don' t cause dise ase, at least not in any way that we currently understand. How did this state of error come about, especially concerning \"infections\" wit h bacteria and v iruses? It goes back a long time\u2014even to philosophies espoused in ancient Greece. Several philosophers and medics promoted this theory during the Renaissance,4 b ut in modern times this masquerade became the explana tion for most disease with that great fraud and plagiarist, Louis Pasteur , father of the germ theory . Imagine a case i n which some p eople who drink the milk from a certain cow develop profuse, bloody diarrhea. Y our job is to find the cause of the problem. Y ou wonder whether th ere is a transmissible agent in the milk that is be ing consumed by the unfor tunate people, which makes them ill. This seems perfectly reasonable thus far . Y ou then examine the milk under the newly invented microscope appa ratus and find a bacterium in the milk; you can tell by its ap pearance that it is dif ferent from the usual bact eria that are found in all milk. Y ou carefully examine the milk, discover that most if not all of the people with bloody di arrhea in fact did drink this milk. Y ou then examine the milk consumed by people who didn' t develop diarrhea and find that none of the milk samples c ontain this particular bacterium . Y ou name the bacte ria \"list eria\" after a fellow scientist. Then, to wrap up the case, you purify the bacteria, so that nothing else from the milk remains. Y ou give this purified bacterial culture to a p erson who then develops bloody diarrhea; the clincher is that you then find this same bacteria in their stool. Case closed; infection proven. Pasteur did this type of exper iment for forty years. He found sick people, claimed to have isolated a bacterium, gave the pure culture to animals\u2014often by injecting it into their brains\u2014and made them sick. As a result, he became the celebrity scientist of his time, feted by kings and prime ministers , and hailed as a great scientist. His work led to pasteurization, a technique responsible for destroying the integrity and health-giving pr operties of milk (see chapter 9 ). His experiments ushered in the germ theory of disease, and for over a century this radical new theory has dom inated not only the pr actice of W estern medicine, but also our cultural and economic life. W e are proposin g a dif ferent wa y of understanding the milk study . For example, what if the milk came from cows that were being poisoned or starved? Maybe they were dipped in flea poison; maybe the y were fed grains sprayed with arsenic instead of their natural diet of grass; maybe they were fed distillery waste and c ardboard\u2014a common practice in Pasteur ' s day in many cities around the world. W e now know with certainty that any toxins fed to a nursing mammal show up in her milk. What if these listeria bacteria are not the cause of anything but simply nature' s w ay of digesting and disposing of toxins? After all, this seems to be the role that bacteria play in biological life. If you put stinky stuf f in your compo st pile, the bacteria feed on the stuf f and proliferate. No rational person would claim the compost p ile has an infection. In fact, what the bac teria do in the compost pile is more of a bioremediation. Or , consider a pond that has become a dumping ground for poisons. The algae \"see\" the poison and digest it, returning the pond to a healthier state (as long as you stop poisoning the pond). Again, this is bioremediation, not infection. If yo u ta ke aero bic bacteria\u2014ba cteria that need oxygen\u2014and put them in an anaerobic environment in which their oxygen supply is re duced, they often produce poisons. Clostridi a is a family of bacteria that un der healthy circumstances ferments carbohydrates in the lower bowel to produce important compounds like butyr ic acid; but under anaerobic conditions, this bacteria produce s poisons that c an cause botulism. It' s the poisons, not the bacteria itself, that make people sick; or more fundamentally , it' s the environment or terrain that cause the bacteria to create the poisons. Isn' t it possible that toxins in the milk\u2014possibly because the cow is not well nourished and cannot eas ily get rid of the toxins\u2014account for the presence of listeria (which is always present in our bodies, along with billions of other bacteria and particles called viruses)? The listeria is simply biodegrading the toxins that proliferate due to the unhealthy condition of the milk. The cen tral question then is how can we prove that the listeria, and not something toxic in the milk, is causing the diarrhea? The answer is the same as in the ping-pong ball example: feeding a healthy person the milk is like throwing the bucket with stones, ice, and (yes) a ping-pong ball at the wall; it proves nothing. Y ou must isol ate the ball\u2014in this case, the listeria\u2014and feed onl y this to the healthy per son or animal to see what happens. This is what Pasteur claims to have done in his papers. Pasteur passed his laboratory notebooks along to his heirs with the provision that they never m ade the notebooks public. However , his grandson, Louis Pasteur V allery-Radot, who apparently didn' t care for Pasteur much, donated the note books to the French national lib rary , which published them. In 1914, Profes sor Gerard Geison of Princeton University published an analysis of these notebooks, which revealed that Pasteur had committed mass ive fraud in all his studies. For instance, when he said that he injected virulent anthrax spores into vaccinated and unvaccinated animals, he could trumpet the fact that the unvaccinated anima ls died, but that was because he also injected the unvaccinated animals with poisons. In th e notebooks, Pasteur state s unequivocally that he was u nable to transfer disease with a pure culture of bacteria (he obviously wasn' t able to purify viruses at that time.) In fact, the only w ay he could t ransfer disease was to either ins ert the whole in fected tissue into another animal (he would sometimes injec t ground-up brains of an animal into the brain of anotheranimal to \"prove\" contagion) or resort to adding poisons to his culture, which he knew would cause the symptoms in the recipients.5 He admitted that the whole ef fort to prove contagion was a failure, leading to his famous deathbed confession: \"The germ is nothing; the terrain is everything.\" In this case, terrain re fers to the c ondition of the animal or person and whether the animal or person had been subject to poison. Since Pasteur ' s day , no one has demonstrated experimentally the transmissibility of disease with pure cultures of bacteria or viruses. No one has both ered sin ce Pasteur ' s time to throw a ping-pong ball at a wall and see what happens. Incredible as that may seem, we are sitting on a house of cards that has re sulted in incalculable harm to humanity , the bio sphere, and the geosphere of the Earth. In chapters 2 and 3 , we will examine cases in which bacteria or viruses were fal sely acc used of causing disease. Read on, dear friends; the ride has only started. CHAPTER 2 E L E C T R I C I T Y A N D D I S E A S E The earliest \"electricians\" wer e not technicians who installed wires in houses; they were physicians and \"healers\" who used the newly discovered phenomena of electric current and static electricity to treat people with ailments\u2014from deafness to headaches to paralysis. The only problem with having patients touch Leyden jars (a device that stores a h igh-voltage electric char ge) or subject themselves to electric currents was that it sometimes caused harm and occasionally killed them. One thing these early electrica l experimenters noted was that people showed a range of sensitivity t o electricity . According to Alexander von Humboldt, a Prussian scientist who (among other experiments) subjected himself and others to the shocks of electric eels, \"It is ob served that susceptibility to electrical irritation and electrical conductivity , dif fers as much fr om one individual to another , as the phenomena of living matter dif fer from those of dead material.\"1 These ea rly studies captured the imagination of researchers; they began to realize that electric currents ran through the bodies of frogs and humans and that even p lants were sensitive to electrical phenomena. A fter a 1749 earthquake in London, British physician W illiam Stukeley concluded that electricity must play a role in ea rthquakes because the residents of London felt \"pains in th eir joints, rheumatism, sickness, headache, p ain in their back, hy steric an d nervous disorders . . . exactly upon electrification, and to some it has proved fatal.\"2 As early as 1799, researchers puzzled over the cause of in fluenza, which appeared suddenly , often in diverse places at the same time, and could not be exp lained by contagion. In 1836, Heinrich Schweic h, author of a book on inf luenza, noted that all physiological process es produce electricity and theorized that a n electrical disturbance of the atmosphere may pre vent the body from dis char ging it. He repeated the then-common belief th at the accumulation of electricity in the body causes the symptoms of influenza.3 W ith the discovery of the sun' s electrical nature, scientists have made some interesting observations. The period 1645-1715 is one that astronomers call the Maunde r Minimum, when the sun was quiet; astronomers obs erved no sunspots during the time span, and t he northern lights (aurora borealis) were nonexistent; in 1715, sunspots reappeared, as did the northern lights. Sunspot activity then increased, reaching a high in 1727. In 1728, influenza appeared in waves on every continent. Sunspot activities becam e more violent until they peaked in 1738, when physicians reported flu in both man and a nimals (including dogs, horses, and birds, especially sparrows). By some estimates, two million people perished during the ten-year pandemic. These and other facts about the relationship of influenza to distu rbances in electr icity come from a remarkable book, The Invisible Rainbow by Arthur Firstenber g.4 Firstenber g chronicles the history of electricity in the United States and throughout th e world, and the outbreaks of illness that accompanied each step toward greater electrification. The first stage involved the installation of telegraph lines; by 1875, these formed a spiderweb over the earth totaling seven hundred thousand miles, with enough copper wire to encircle t he globe almost thirty times. W i th it came a new dise ase called neurasthenia. Like those suf fering today from \"chronic fatigue syndrome,\" patients felt weak and exhausted and were unable to concentrate. They had headaches, dizziness, tinnitus, floaters in the eyes, racing pulse, pains in the heart region, and palpitations; they were depressed and had panic attacks. Dr . Geor g e Miller Beard and the medical community observed that the disease spread along the routes of railroads and telegraph lines; it often resembled the c ommon cold or influenza and commonly seized people in the prime of life.5 In 1 889, we mar k the beginning of the modern electrical era and also of a de adly flu pan demic, which followed the advent of electricity throughout the globe. Said Firstenber g : \"Influenza struck explos ively and unpredictably , o ver and over in waves until early 1894. It was as if something fundamental had changed in the atmosphere.\"6 Physicians puzzled over influenza' s capricious spread. For e xample, W illiam Beveridge, author of a 1975 textbook on influenza, noted, \"The English warship Arachne was cruising of f the coast of Cuba 'without any contact with land.' No less than 1 14 men out of a crew of 149 fell ill with influenza and only later was it l earnt that there had been outbre aks in Cuba at the same time.\"7 During W orld W ar I, governments on both sides of the conflict i nstalled antennas, which eventually blan keted the earth with strong radio signals\u2014 and duri ng the latter part of 191 8, disaster struck. The Spanish flu af flicted a third of the world' s population and killed about fifty million people, more than the Black Death of the f ourteenth century . T o stop the contagion, communities shut down schools, businesses, and theaters; people were ordered to wear masks and refrain from shaking hands.8 Those living on military bases, which bristled with antennas, were the most vulnerable. A common symptom was bleeding\u2014from the nostrils, gums, ea rs, skin, stomach, intestines, uterus, kidneys, and brain. Many died of hemorrhage in the lungs, drowning in their own blood. T ests revealed a decreased abilit y of the blood to coagulate. Those close to death often developed \"that peculiar blue color which seemed to mark all early fatal cases.\"9 Health o f ficials were desperate to find a cause. The team of physicians from the US Public Health Service tried to infect their one hundred healthy volunteers at a naval facility on Gallops Island in Boston Harbor . A sense of frustration pervades the report, written by Milton J. Rosenau, MD, and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association .10 Rosenau had built a succ essful career in public health by instilling a fear of germs, overseeing quarantines, and warning the public about the dangers of raw milk. He believe d that something called Pfeiffer bacillus was the cause. The researchers care fully extracted throat and nasal mucus and even lung material from cadavers and transferred it to the throats, respiratory tracts, and nos es of volunteers. \"W e used some billions of these or ganisms, according to our estimated coun ts, on each one of the volunteers, but none of them took sick,\" he said. Then the y drew blood from those who were sick and injected it into ten volunteers. \"None of these took sick in any way .\" Thoroughly perplexed, Rosenau and the other researchers designed the next exp eriment \"to imitate the natural way in which influenza spreads, at least the way in which we believe influenza spreads, and I have no doubt it does [ev en though his experiments showed that it doesn' t]\u2014by human contact.\" They instructed tho se af flicted to breathe and cough over volunteers. \"The volunteer was led up to the bedside of the pat ient; he was introduced. He sat down alongside the bed of the patient. They shook hands, a nd by instructions, he got as close as he conveniently could, and they talked for five minutes. At the end of the five minutes, the patient breathed out as hard as he could, while the volunteer , muzzle to muzzle (in accordance with his instructions , about 2 inches between the two), received this expired breath, and at the same time was breathing in as the patient breathed out. This they repeated five times.\" The volunteers were watched carefully for seven days, but alas, \"none of them took sick in any way .\" \"Perhaps,\" said Rosenau, \"th ere are factors, or a factor , in the transmission of influenza that we do not know . . . . Perhaps if we have learned anything , it is that we are not quite sure what we know about the disease.\" Researchers ev en tried to infect healthy horses with the mucous secretions of horses with the flu1 1\u2014yes, animals also became ill during the pandemic\u2014but the results we re the same. The Spanish flu was not contagious, and physicians coul d attach no blame to the accused bacterium nor provide an explanation for its global reach. The yea r 1957 marked the insta llation of radar worldwide. The \"Asian\" influenza pandem ic began in Fe bruary 1957 and lasted for a year . A decade later , the United States launche d twenty-eight satellites into the V an Allen belts as part of the Initial Defense Communication Satellite Program (IDCSP), ushering in the Hong Kong flu pandemic, which be gan in July 1968. As First enber g observed, \"In each case\u2014in 1889, 1918, 1957 and envelope of the earth . . . was suddenly and profoundly disturbed,\"12 and along with it the electrica l circuits in the human body . W estern medicine pays scant attention to the electrical nature of living things\u2014plants, animals, and humans\u2014but mountains of evidence indicate that fain t curren ts govern everything that happens in the body to keep us alive and healthy . From the coagulation of the blood to ener gy production in the mito chondria, even to small amounts of copper in the bones, which create cu rrents for the maintenance of bone structure\u2014all can be influenced by the presenc e of electricity in the atmosphere, especially \"dirty\" electricity , char acterized by many overlapping frequencies and jagged changes in frequency and voltage. T oday we know that each cell in the body has its own elec trical grid, maintained by structured water inside the cell membrane (see chapter 8 ). Cancer occurs when this structure breaks down, and canc er has increased with e ach new development in the electrification of the earth.13 Humankind has lived for thousa nds of years with our brains tuned to the Schuman resonances of the earth, our bodies and indeed all life bathed in a static el ectric field of 130 volts per meter . The electronic symphony that gives us life is soft and delicate. Minute electrical currents that course through leaf veins or through the glial cells in our nervous syste m guide the growth and metabolism of a ll life-forms. Our cells communicate in whispers in the radiofrequency range. T raditional Chinese medicine has long recognized the electrical nature of th e hu man bo dy and has deve loped a system to defuse the \"accumulation of e lectricity\" that leads to dis ease. It' s called acupuncture. Many things that we do instin ctively also help release any unhealthy buildu p of current \u2014the mother who strokes her infant' s head or who scratches her children' s backs to put them to sleep, the caresses of lovers, walking bare foot on the earth, m assage, even handshakes and hugs\u2014all now discoura ged by the frowny faces of health authorities. Fast-forward to the Internet and cell phone era. Accor ding to Firstenber g, the onset of cell phone service in 1996 resulted in greater levels of morta lity in major cities like Los Angeles, New Y ork, San Diego, and Boston.14 Over the years, wireless signals at multiple frequencies have filled the atmosphere to a greater and greater extent, along with mysterious outbreaks like SARS and MERS. T oday th e quiet hum of life-giv ing current is infiltrated by a jangle of overlapping and jarring frequencies\u2014from power lines to the fridge to the cell phone. It started with the telegraph and progressed to worldwide electricity , then radar , then sa tellites that disrupt the ionosphere, then ubiquitous W i-Fi. The most recent addition to this disturbing ra cket is fifth generation wireless\u20145G. 5G is broadcast in a range of microwave frequencies: mostly 24- 72 GHz, wi th the range of 700-2500 MHz also considered 5G. Frequencies in this range (below the frequency of light) are called nonionizing , in contrast with ionizing ra diatio n, whic h has a higher frequency than light. Ionizing radiation, such as X-rays, causes electrons to split of f atoms, obviously something to which exposure must be limited. (This is why a lead shield is put on patients when they get X-rays.) Instead of producing char ged ions when passing through matter , nonionizing electromagnetic radiation changes the rotational, vibrational, and electronic valence configurations of molecules and atoms. This produces therma l ef fects (think m icrowave ovens). The telecommunications industry flatly denies any nonthe rmal ef fects on living tissue, even though a lar ge body of research suggests considerable harm to the delicate electromagnetic systems in the human body from constant exposure to nonionizing frequencies. In particular , high-frequency electromagnetic fields lik e 5G af fect cell membrane permeability15\u2014not a good thing when the arch itecture of a healthy cel l ensures that it is not per meable except in controlled situations. W e are already familiar with millimeter wave technology; this is the frequency of airport scanners, w hich can see through your cloth es. Children and pregnant women are not req uired to go through these scanners, a nod to potential danger s. Adults get zapped a second or two; 5G bathes us in the same kind of radiation twenty-four seven. Of particular concern is the fact that some 5G transmitters broadcast at 60 G Hz, a frequency that is absorbed by oxygen, causing the oxygen molecule (composed of two oxygen atoms) to split apart, making it useless for respiration.16 On S eptember 26, 2019, 5G w ireless was turned on in W uhan , China (and of f icially la unched Novem ber 1) with a grid of about ten thousand 5G base stations\u2014more than exist in the entire United States\u2014all concentrated in one city .17 A spike in cas es occurred on February 13\u2014the same week that W uhan turned on its 5G network for monitoring traf fic.18 Illness h as followed 5G installation in all the major cities in A merica, starting with New Y ork in Fall 2019 in Manhattan, along with parts of Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Queens\u2014all subsequent coronavirus hot spots. Los Angeles, Las V egas, Dalla s, Cleveland, and Atlanta soon followed, with some five thousand town s and cities now covered. Citizens of the small country of San Marino (the first country in the world to install 5G, in September 2018) have had the longest exposure to 5G and the highest infection rate\u2014four times higher than Italy (which deployed 5G in June 2019), and twenty-seven times h igher than Croatia, which has n ot deployed 5G.19 In rura l areas, the illness bla med on the coronavirus is sli ght to nonexistent.20 In E urope, illness is highly co rrelated with 5G rollout. For e xample, Milan an d other areas in northe rn Italy have the densest 5G coverage, and northern Italy has twenty-two times as many coronavirus cases as Rome.21 In S witzerland, telecommunications companies have built mo re than two thousand antennas, but the Swiss have halted at least some of the 5G rollout due to h ealth concerns. Switzerland has had far fewer coronavirus cases than nearby France, Spain, and Germany , where 5G is going full steam ahead. Iran announced an of ficial 5G la unch in late March 2020, but assuming prelaunch testing in February , the advent of 5G correlates w ith the first Covid-19 cases at the same time . Korea has installed over seven ty thousand 5G bases and re ported over eight thousand cases of illness by mid-March. Japan be gan test ing 5G in tunne ls in Hokkaido in early Februar y 2020, and this city now has the most case s of coronavirus in Japan, even more than T okyo.22 In South America, the 5G rollout has occurred in Brazil, Chile, Ecuador , and Mex ico, all of which have many coronavirus cases. Count ries without 5G, such as Gu yana, Suriname, French Guiana, and Paragua y have not reported any cases. Paraguay is doing what all countries should do\u2014 building a national fiber optics network without resorting to 5G.23 Bartomeu Payeras i Cifre, a Spanish epidemiologist, has charted the rollout of 5G in European citi es and countries with cases p er thousand people a nd demo nstrated \"a clear and close relationship between the rate of coronavirus infections and 5G antenna location.\"24 What about Covid-19 in the Am azon basin? The Pan American Health Or ganization (P AHO) estimates that there are at least twen ty thousand active coronavi rus cases among the indigenous peoples.25 They live a primitive lifesty le, but 5G is already there,26 along with \"twenty- five enormously powerful surveillance radars, ten Doppler weather radars, two hundred floating water -monitor ing stations, nine hundred radio-equipped 'listening posts,' thirty-two radio stations, eight airborne sta te-of-the-art surveillance jets equipped wit h fog-penetrating radar , and ninety-nine 'attack/trainer ' support aircraft,' [all which dual human beings and 'hear a twig snap' anywhere in the Amazon.\"27 These were installed in 2002 as part of t he System for V igilance of t he Amazon (SIV AM), which monitors activities in a two-million-square-mile area of remote wilderness. All life in the Amazon is bathed with a range of electromagnetic frequencies. These 5G freque ncies go only a short distance and cannot penet rate into buildings. Howe ver , a few tech startups are working to get the 5G signal into the areas where we work, play , and sleep. Pivotal Commware is testing an \"Echo 5G In-Building Penetration Device.\"28 Pivotal' s of fices are about one mile from the Life Care nursing home in Kirkland, W ashington, where th e illness first appeared in the United States, and whe re twenty-five residents died. W as the Life Care cent er a testing ground for Pivotal' s new devi ce? Health-care facilities also teem with electronic equip ment, some of i t located right by the heads of s ick patients. People who suf fer from electri cal hypersensitivity cannot go near many hospitals and nursing homes. The 5G system is also installed on modern cruise ships. For e xample, the Diamond Princess cruise ship advertises \"the best W i-Fi at sea.\"29 On February 3, 2020, the ship was q uarantined in Y okohama, Japan after many passengers complained of illne ss. In the end, 381 passengers and crew members became sick, and fourteen died. The Diamond Princess cruise ship. The four round objects on the top of the ship are 5G antennas and transmitters. Of inter est is the fact that the m ilitary has crowd-control devices that operate in the sa me ranges: 6-100 GHz. The 95 GHz Active De nial System is a weapon that can penetrate the skin and produce intolerable heating sensations, causing people to move away from the beam.30 The EUR OP A EMF Guideline 2016 states \"there is strong evidence that long-term exposure to certain EMFs is a risk factor for diseases such as certain cancers, Alzheimer ' s disease, and male infertility . . . . Common EHS (electromagnetic hypersensitivity) symptoms include ficulties, sleep problems, depression, lack of ener gy , fatigue, and flu-like symptoms [emphasis added].\"31 An article published in May 2020 in T oxicology Letters found that in real-world cond itions, exposure to wide-spectrum nonionizing frequencies adversely impacted skin, eyes, heart, liver , kidney , spleen, blood, and bone marrow .32 Electro magnetic frequencies also disturb the immune functio n through stimulation of various aller gic and inflammatory responses, and they adversely af fect tissue repair .33 The Russians studied the ef fec ts of millimeter waves on anim als and humans in 1979. W orkers servicing ultra-high-frequency generators complained of fatigue, drowsiness, headaches, and loss of memory . The blood was particularly af fecte d, with a reduction in the amount of hemoglobin and a tendency toward hyper -coagulation.34 Even earlier , in 1971, the US Naval Medical Research Institute published more than twenty-three hundred references in a \"Bibliography of Reported Biological Phenomena ('Ef fects') and Clinical Manifestations Attributed to Microwave and Radio-Frequency Radiation.\"35 They found adverse ef fects almost everywhere in the body; in addition to \"generalized degeneration of all b ody tissue,\" they noted altered sex ratio of births (more g irls), altered fetal de velopment, decreased lactation in nursing mothers, seizures, convulsions, anxiety , thyroid enlar gement, decreased testosterone production, and \u2014of particular interest\u2014sparking between dental fillings and a peculiar metallic taste in the mouth. One research review of almost two hundred studies36 noted, \"non- thermal ef fects have been cle arly demonstrated in thousands of peer - reviewed publications.\" Whereas some EMF frequency band patterns are coherent and may be health-promoting, \"the chosen 5G frequencies belong for a great pa rt to the detrimental zones.\" The authors noted that government studies claiming 5G safety have taken no account of the fact that 5G radiation can be pulsatin g and modulated and emitted from multiple antennas. Of interest is the find ing \"that EMF waves can also be circularly polarized by interaction with atmospheric dust and therefore may penetrate much deeper into the or ganis m. In addition, 5G waves m ay exhibit interference with other EMF wave frequencies, resulting in standing waves and environmental 'hot spots' of radiation that can be very taxing on EMF hypersensitive individuals.\" Air pollution and 5G are not a good mix! A study published in Fr ontiers in Oncology describes lung injury from radiation therapy . Radiation therapy uses shorter waves at close range for a shorter period of time, but it stands to reason that 5G millimeter waves, with tran smitters nearby , pulsing massive amounts of frequency at all times, could al so cause lung injury . Ac cording to the authors, \"Depending on the dose and volume of lung irra diated, acute radiation pneumonitis may develop, characterized by dry cough and dyspnea (shortness of breath).\"37 Of i nterest is the fact that Lloyd' s of London and other insurance carriers won' t cover injury from cell phones, W i-Fi, or smart meters. EMFs are clas sified as a pollutant, alongside smoke, chemicals, and asbestos: \"The Electromagnetic Fields Exclusion (Exclusion 32) is a General Insurance Exclu sion and is applied across the market as sta ndard. The purpose of the exclusion is t o exclude cover for illnesses caused by continuous, long -term non-ioniz ing radiation exposure i.e. through mobile phone usage.\"38 According to Dr . Cameron Kyle-Sidell, working in an emer gency room (ER) in New Y ork, the af flicted are literally gasping for air . \"W e've never seen anything like it!\" he said .39 Covid-19 patients' symptoms resemble those of high-altitude sickness rather than viral pneumonia. In fact, the ventilators that the hospitals have scrambled to obtain may do more harm than good and may be accounting for the high mortality rate, as they increase pressur e on the lungs. These patients don' t need help breathing\u2014 they nee d more oxygen when th ey take a breath. Many turn blue in the face. These are not signs of a contagious disease but of disruption of our mechanisms for producing ener gy and getting oxygen to the red blood cells. Remember that during the Spanish flu, the problem was the lack of blood coagulability; with Covid-19, a key problem is lack of oxygen in the blood\u2014both conditions point to electrical toxicity rather than infection\u2014 iron-rich blood cells would be especially vulnerable to the ef fects of electromagnetism. And there' s another symptom: patients uzzing sensations throu ghout their body , \"an electric feeling on the skin,\" or skin that feels like it is burning. Those who are electrically sensitive report similar sensations when they are near a cell p hone or use GPS-guided cru ise control in their cars. Other symptoms include a loss of smell an d taste, fever , aches, breathlessness, fatigue, dry cough, diarrhea, strokes, and seizures\u2014all of which are also reported by tho se who are electrically sensitive. The correlation of 5G rollout and Covid-19 cases, and the similarity of symptoms, shou ld give us pause. Shouldn' t we look more closely before we institute mandatory vaccination and electronic ID chipping? Shouldn' t we test to see whether this virus is actually contagious before we mandate social distancing and prescribe face masks? T oday' s pandemic raises many questions. What makes some people more vu lnerable than others to th e ef fects of 5G? Why did thirty-five sailors on t he battleship Arachne not get sick? Which environ mental factors weaken our defenses? How should we treat this disease if it is not a viral disease? What about our diets? Can we protect ourselves with the right food choices? W e will address these questions in subsequent chapters. Most im portant, we will show that the minute particles called viruses are actu ally exosomes\u2014not invaders but toxin-gobbling messengers that our cell s produce to help us adjust to environmental assault s, including electro-smog. After all, most people have adjusted to worldwide radio waves, electricit y in their homes, and ubiquitous W i-Fi (and the sparrow population rebou nded after the flu of 1738); exosomes are wha t allow this to happ en. These tiny messengers provide real-time and rapid genetic adaptation to environmental cha nges. Whether these exosomes can help us adapt to the extreme disruption of 5G is the question of the day .CHAPTER 3 P A N D E M I C S Thr oughout histo ry , philosopher s believed that comets wer e \" harbingers of doom, disease, and death, in fecting men with a blood lu st to war , contaminating cr ops, and dispersing disease and plague.\"1 The Chinese textbook Mawangdui Silk details twenty-nine types of comets, dating back to 1500 BC, and the disasters that followed each one. \"Comets are vile stars,\" wrote a Chinese of ficial in 648 AD. \"Every time they appear in the south, they wipe out the old and establish the new . Fish grow sick, crops fail. Emperors and common people die, and men go to war . The people hate life and don' t want to speak of it.\"2 In medie val Europe and even in colonial America, observers as sociated the appearance of comets with the onset of disease.3 In the summer of 536 AD, a mysterious and dramatic cloud of dust appeared over the Mediterranean and for eighteen months darkened the sky as far east as China. According to the Byzantine historian Procopius, \"During this year a most dread p ortent took place. For the sun gave forth its light without brightness . . . and it seemed exceedingly like the sun in eclipse, for the beams it shed were not clear .\"4 Analysis of Greenland ice deposited between 533 and 540 AD shows high levels of tin, nickel, and iron oxides, suggesting that a comet or fragment of a co met may have h it the Earth at that time.5 The imp act like ly triggered volcanic eruptions, which spewed more dust into the atmosphere. W ith the darkened sky , temperatures dropped, crops failed, and famine descended on many parts of the world. Depiction of various types of comets in Chinese documents. Shortly afterwar d, in 541 AD, a mysterious illness began to appear on the outskirts of the Byzantine Empire. V ictims suf fered from delusions, nightmares, and fevers; they had lymph node swellings in the groin, armpits, and behind their ears. The plague, named after the reigning Emperor Justinian, arrived in Constantinople (the capital) in 542. Procopiusnoted th at bodies were left stac ked in the open due to a lack of space for proper burial. He estimated that in the city at its peak, the plague was killing ten thousand people per day .6 The current explanation for the correlation of comets and diseas e is that of \"p anspermia. \" W e now know that outer space is populated by clouds of microor ganisms, and the theory holds that comets are watery bo dies\u2014dirty snowballs\u2014that rain new microscopic forms on the earth, to which humans and animals have no immunity .7 However , recent evidence indicates little if any water on comets. Rather , they are asteroids that have an elliptical orbit and become char ged electrically as they approach the sun, an exchange that creates the comet' s bright co ma and tail. Their surfa ces exhibit the kind of features that happen with inte nse elec trical arcing, like craters and clif fs; bright or shiny spots on otherwise barren rocky surfaces indicate areas that are electrically char ged. Comets contain mineral alloys requiring temperatures in the thousands of degrees, and they have suf ficient ener gy to emit extreme UV light and even powerful X-rays . Moreover , as comets approach the sun, they c an provoke high-ener gy dischar ges and flare-ups of solar plasma, which reach out to the comet.8 Bright spots on a comet' s surface indicate strong electromagnetic activity . A solar flare reaches out to a highly charged comet.Cliffs and pitting on a comet' s surface indicate intense electrical arcing. Thus, comets can create electrical disturbances in the atmosphere even more po werful than those created by man-made electrification \u2014 and this radiation includes demonstrably dangerous ionizing radiation. No wonder the ancients were afraid of comets! The conventional view holds that the Plague of Justinian was a case of bubonic plague. Researchers analyzed the remains from gra ves of the period and detected DNA from the Y ersinia pestis .9 Mainstream thinking has concluded that rats and other rodents carry Y ersinia pestis a nd pass it along to fleas. W hen rats die, th e blood-sucking fleas leave them to prey on other rat s, dogs, and humans. Th e bacteria then enter humans vi a flea bites. Researchers believe that during the time of Justinian, rats on merchant ships carried the microor ganism to the other Mediterranean ports. The clas sic sign of bubonic pla gue are buboes\u2014badly swollen lymph nodes. T hese often appear in th e groin because, according to conventional thinking, most fleabites occur on the legs. Those infected will first experience fever s, chills, and muscle pains before developing septicemia or pneumonia. The plague reappeared at period ic intervals over the next three hundred years, with the l ast recorded occurrence in 750 AD\u2014possibly explained by still-orbiting cometary debris. It eventually claimed 25 percent of inhabitants in the Mediterranean region. Then the plague disap peared from Europe u ntil the Black Death of the fourteenth century\u2014 also pr esaged by a comet. According to historian Thomas Short: In France . . . was seen the terrible Com et called Negra. In December appeared over A vignon a Pillar of F ire. There were ma ny great Earthquakes, T empests, Thunders and Lightnings, and thousands of People were swallowed up; the Courses of Rivers were stopt; some Chasms of the Earth sent forth Blood . T errible Showers of Hail, each stone weighing 1 P ound to 8; Abortions in all Countries; in Germany it rained Blood; in France Blood gushed out of Graves of the Dead, and sta ined the Rivers crimson; Comets, meteors, Fire- beams, coruscations in the Air , Mock-suns, the Heavens on Fire.10 According to textbooks, the same bubonic plague or ganism of Justinian' s time caused the Blac k Death in Europe, 1347-1350. However , some investiga tors have pointed out flaws in this theory . Although researchers found evidence of Y ersina pestis in dental pulp from a mass grave of the period in France, o ther teams of scientists were unable to find evidence of the pathogen in five other grave sites of the period from other parts of Europe.1 1 Sociologist Susan Scott and biologist Christopher J. Duncan claim that a he morrhagic fever , similar to the Ebola virus, caused the Black Death. Others b lame anthrax or some n ow-extinct disease. They note that medieval accounts don' t square with mo dern descriptions of the illness. W itnesses described a disease that spread at great speed with very high mortality , unlike the plague, which move s slowly and had a death rate of about 60 percent. Accoun ts describe buboes covering the entire body rather than limited to the g roin area as in the case of plague. Symptom descriptions mention awful odors, splotches resembling bruises, delirium, and stupor\u2014 none of which h appen with modern-day bubonic plague. Some critics have embraced the theory that a virus caused the disease, but this pre mise hardly provides a better explanation t han does bacteria to explain th e disease' s rapid spread and high mortality . Then there is th e rat problem. No written documents from that time describe vast legions of dead rats required to explain the plague. The Black Death ki lled over half of Iceland' s population, but rats didn' t reach Iceland until the nineteenth century . An d the Black Death continued to kill people during th e winte r months in nort hern Europe despite the fact tha t the plague or ganism requires relatively warm temperatures.12 In New Light on the Black Death: The Cosmic Connection, Professor Mike Ba illie ar g ues that a com et caused the pandemic. He poi nts out that witnesses of the period describe a significant earthquake on January 25, 1348, with other earthquakes to follow . \"There have been masses of dead fish, animals, and other things along the sea shore and in m any places covered in dust,\" wrote a cont emporary observer . \"And all these things seem to have come from the great corruption of the air and ea rth.\" Other documents desc ribe tidal waves, rains of fire, foul odors, strange colors in the sky , mists and even dragons, in addition to earthquakes.13 Baillie believes that fragments from Comet Negra, which passed by earth in 1347, caused the atmospheric phenomena. Some fragments descended and injected huge am ounts of dust into the atmosphere. T ree ring analysis indicates that as the material descended from space, it spewed lar ge amounts of chemicals based on carbon and nitrogen into the stratosphere. According to Baillie, illness and death resulted from poisoned w ater and air as the comet flew overhead.14 But the symptoms\u2014especially b ruise-like blotches on the skin and high fatality rate\u2014in dicate radiation poisoning, probably rendered even more deadly by dust and ammonia-like compounds in the atmosphere. Imagine a lar ge co met passing near the ea rth, crackling with intense electrical arcing, pelting t he earth with X-rays and casting of f fragments that fall to the earth and spew up toxic clouds of du st, followed immediately by horrible death, sometimes wipin g out whole tow ns. This is not the kind of cata strophe that we can blame on microbes. Perhaps our solar system is calm ing down\u2014mankind has not seen such violent phenomena for centuries. But smaller electrical disturbances, ones that can ' t be seen, are still likely to promote outbreaks, albeit less disastrous. And if radiation poisoning\u2014whether ionizing or no nionizing\u2014 provokes disease, there are obvious cofactors. Poisons in air , water , and to filth; malnutrition; an d starvation; as well as fear and despair\u2014we don' t need to resort to the notion of contagion to explain outbreaks of disease. Let us consider insect-borne diseases. Many (if not most) biting or stinging insects release toxins\u2014 often complex chemicals that can tar get the nervous system. W asps, bees, flies, beetles, mosquitos,15 ticks, bedbugs, lice, and ants all produce poisonous substances. Early studies suggest that insect saliva has chemicals with vasodilatory , anticoag ulant, and immunosuppressive properties, although in recent times there ha s been little interest in (or research money for) the study of insect saliva. In a ddition to o vert poisons, insect saliva may contain parasite eggs. T apeworms can be transmitted b y fleas, and mosquito bites contain the eggs of plasm odium, a parasite said to cause malaria. Mosquitos also carry fly larvae, w hich can enter the body through bites, causing myiasis , a parasitic infestation of the body by fly lar vae (maggots), which grow inside the host. Some m osquito species can carry filariasis, a parasite that causes a disfiguring condition called elephantiasis. These diseases are \"infectious\" in the sens e that people acquire them from something outside the body , such as an insect, but only in the most bizarre of circumstances can they be transferred from one human being to another . Actually , scientists have yet to solve the mystery of malaria, a disease that kills over one thousand people per day . The conventional view is that mosquitoes in tropical and subt ropical regions transfer parasites to human blood th rough th eir bites, and th is parasite then destroys red blo od cells and causes i ntermittent fever . But the type of mosquito said to cause malaria inhabits every continent except Antarctica, including Europe and North America, where malaria is no longer a problem. From the fifteenth century until rec ent time s, many people in England suf fered from malaria under the name of \"marsh fever\" or \" ague\"\u2014always associated with living in swampy marshes. In fact, what is common to areas known for malaria (both today an d in the past) is human habitation in swamps and we tlands\u2014and not just warm wetlands (which are conducive to mosquitos) but also wetlands in cooler areas such as England. W etlands produce swamp gases\u2014a mixture of hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and especially methane. Methane poisoning ca uses fever , headaches, muscle weakness, nausea, vomiting, and feelings of asphyxiation\u2014remarkably similar to the symptoms of malaria: fever , muscle weakness, nausea, vom iting, and chest and abdominal pain. Like malaria, methane poisoning can result in the destruction of red blood cells.16 In areas of the world where people still live in swampy areas, intermittent exposure to swamp gases, which are undoubtedly stronger during warm weather or flooding seasons, seems a better explanation than mosquitos for this stubborn disease. The conventional view holds that \"viral diseases\" such as yellow fever , dengue fever fever , and chikugunya are transmitted by mosquitos carrying viruses that \"attach to and enter susceptible cells.\" According to textbooks, once these viruses enter the body and begin to replicate inside the c ells, they ar e contagious and are spread from person to per son through airborne droplets, sexual contact, eating food and drinking water contaminated with the virus, and even touching surfaces and bodily fluids contaminated with the virus. But we don' t need the concepts of viruses and contagion to explain these diseases. Environments infested with fleas, mosquitos, lice, and other insects carrying toxins or parasites w ill result in many individuals, especially individuals with suboptimal nutrition, manifesting similar symptoms\u2014an \"outbreak\" that requires no premise of person-to-person contact, only many people subject to the sam e stressors. For exam ple, th e \"outbreak\" of Zika \"virus,\" blamed for a rash of babies born with tragically small heads , followed a campaign of DPT vaccinations given to poor pregnant women in Brazil.17 T oxins a re powerful stressors. Sewage fumes contain a mixture of toxic gaseous compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, methane, and ammonia. High concentratio ns of methane and carbon dioxide displace oxygen. In conditions of low oxygen, beneficial fermentative bacteria begin producing toxins instead of helpful compounds. Industrial chemicals in sewage can add to the adverse e f fects, especially if these toxins make their way int o drinking water . In ti mes past, these toxins included mercury , arsenic, and lead. Lead used for roofing, tanks, gutters, pipes, cables, and winemaking (and even added to recipes in Roman times) poisoned directly , through drinking water , or throu gh the skin. Renaissance noblewomen wore makeup containing white lead ore, vinegar , arsenic, hydroxide, and carbonate, applied to the face over egg whites or a mercury foundation. Arsenic face powder was the crowning touch.18 T he price for th e flawless complexion was paralysis, madness, and death. Leather tanning contributed greatly to water pollution. Lime, tannin, animal dung, urine, alum, and arsenic were used in the p rocess; the Industrial Revolution added toxic chromium solution to the mix. Production of red paint and dyes, metal extraction, and caustic soda production released mercury . Both mercury and arsenic were popular ingredients in medicines, and they no doubt carried of f as many people as the diseases themselves. The severe vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, and muscle cramping of cholera is blamed on the bacterium V ibrio cholerae , either from sewage- tainted water or shellfish like oysters living in sewage-tainted water . Actually , the killer is a toxin\u2014called \"cholera toxin\" (CT), which the bacteria produce under low-oxygen conditions. Although CT can be deadly , it also has anti -inflammatory properties and has shown pro mise as an immunotherapeutic drug. Cholera af fects up to five million people, mostly in third world countries, and causes over one h undred thousand deaths per year . T reatment includes oral rehydration therapy and zinc supplementation. Children are highly s usceptible to CT , as are those who are malnourish ed or have lowered immunity . One strange observation is the fact that type O blood types are more likely to contract cholera.19 Even today , with the medical world' s fixation on person-to-person transmission of disease and prevention through vaccination, health authorities agree that the solution to cholera is better sanitation . Cholera is rarely s pread directly from person to person, but only through filthy drinking water . An o utbreak of cholera occurre d in Soho, London, in 1854. According to Judith Summers in Br oad Str eet Pump Outbr eak, \"by the middle of the [nineteenth] cen tury , Soho had become an gs, slaughterho uses, and primitive, decaying sewers. And underneath the floorboards of the overcrowded cellars l urked so mething even worse\u2014a fetid sea of cesspits a s old as the houses, and many of which had never been drained. It was only a matter of time before this hidden festering time-bomb exploded.\"20 The previous year , over ten thousand people died of cholera in E ngland. The outb reak in Soho appeared suddenly: \"Few families, rich or poor , were spared th e loss of at least one member . W ithin a week, three-qu arters of the residents had fled from their homes, leaving their shops shuttered, their houses l ocked a nd the streets de serted. Only those who could n ot af ford to leave remained there. It was like the Great Plague all over again.\" Dr . John Snow lived in the center of the outbreak and traced th e source to a pump on the corner of Broa d and Cambridge Streets, at the epicenter of the epidemic. \"I found,\" he wrote afterward, \"that nearly all the deaths had taken place within a short dista nce of the pump.\" In fact, in h ouses much nearer another pump, only ten d eaths occurred\u2014and of those, five victims had drunk the water from the Broad Street pump. W orkers in a local brewery did not get sick\u2014they drank beer provided as a perk of employment. Dr . Snow blamed the outbreak not on toxins but on \"white, flocculent particles,\" which he observed under a microscope.21 Three de cades la ter , Robert Koch tried injecting a culture of these white flocculent partic les into animals, without succeeding in getting them sick\u2014 so cholera failed his second postulate. Cholera also failed his first postulate, as V ibrio cholerae appeared in bot h sick and healt hy people.22 Eve n so , he remained convinced that this bacillus was the cause of cholera\u2014old ideas are dif ficult to dislodge even in the face of conflicting evidence. It be ars emphasis that all cities up to the nineteenth century we re \"fetid seas\" of horse droppings, stinking manure piles, primitive water sanitation, toxic chemicals, crowded livin g conditions, loose pigs, and even raw sewage dumped from houses. Swill from inner -city breweries went to cows in inner -city confinement dairies, producing poisoned milk in conditions of unimaginable filth. The death rate among children born in these conditions was 50 percent. Of ficials blame d the death rate on the milk, wh ich became the justi fication for pasteurization laws instituted one hundred years later .23 By then, the problem had resolved itself with improved water and sewer systems, better living conditions, the advent of refrigeration, laws prohibiting inner -city breweries and dairies, and (most important) replacement of the horse with the car . Automobiles and buses brought in a dif ferent kind of pollution, but new technologies at least ensu red that the water was finally clean. Much \"infectious disease\" cleared up, th anks not to doctors but rather to inventors and civil engineers. One invention that made life safer was the washing machine, making it easier to keep clothes and bed ding clean, especially as more and more dwellings had hot running water . Another invention was the vacuum cleaner , which helped keep living quarters free of bugs. (W indow screens also helped.) At the turn of the twentieth century , health of ficials considered smallpox to b e highly infectious, but on e physician disagreed. Dr . Charles A. R. Campbell of San Antonio, T exas, believed that smallpox was transmitted by the bites of bedbugs. The modern of ficial view holds that smallpox resulted from contact with a contagious virus\u2014\"T ra nsmission occurred through in halation of airborne V ariola virus , usually droplets expressed from the oral, nasal, or pharyngeal muc osa of an infected person. It was transmitted from one person to another primarily thro ugh prolonged face-to-face contact with an infected person, usually within a distance of 1.8 m (6 feet), bu t could also be sprea d through direct contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated objects ( fomites) such as bedding or clothing . . . the infected person was contagious until the last smallpo x scab fell of f . . . Smallpox was not known to b e transmitted by insects or animals.\"24 No te that this description is written in the past tense\u2014the of ficial view is that smallpox has been conquered by vaccination, not by something as simple as ge tting rid of bedbugs. Dr . C ampbell ran a \"pest house \" for smallpox patients in San A ntonio, where he tried hard to infect himself and others by \"fomites\" and direct face-to-face contact with infected persons: As even the air itself, without contact, is considered suf ficient to convey this disease, and touching th e clothes of a smallpox patient considered equivalent to contract it, I ex posed myself with the same impunity as my pest-house keeper . . . . After numerous exposures, made in the ordinary manner , by going from house to house where the disease was . . . I have never conveyed this disease to my family , or to any of my patients or fr iends, although I did not disinfect myself or m y clothes, nor take any precautions whatever , except to be sure that no bedbugs got about my clothing. Another one of my experiments was thoroughly to beat a rug in a room, only eight or ten feet square, from which had just been r emoved a smallpox patient. . . . I beat this rug in the ro om u ntil the air was stifling, and remained therin for thirty minutes. This represented the respiratory as well as the digestive systems as accepted avenues of infection. . . . After inhaling th e dust from that rug, I examined my sputum microscopically the follo wing morning and found cotton and woolen fibres, pollen and comminuted manure, and also bacteria of many kinds.25 Although Dr . Campbell subsequently mingled with family , patients, and friends, none contracted smallpox. He repeated these experiments with others, f ailing to infect, even wh en in contact with patients cove red in sores, but he always found bedbugs in the houses of those who co ntracted the disease.26 The British and American colon ists used smallpox as a weapon against the Native Americans\u2014they did it by giving them blankets , thus spreading the bedbug to the New W orld. Campbell treated smallpox by administering sources of vitamin C: The m ost i mportant observation on the medical aspect of this disease is the cachexia [bad condition] with which it is associated, and which is actually the soil requisite for its dif ferent degrees of virulence. I refer to the scorbutic cachexia . Among the lower classes of people this particular acquitted constitutional perversion of nutrition is most prevalent, primarily on account of their poverty , but also because of the fact that they care little or nothing fo r fruits or vegetables . . . that it is more prevalent in winter when the anti- scorbutics are scarce and high priced; and finally , that the removal of this perversion of nutrition w ill so mitigate the virulence of this malady as positively to prevent the pitt ing or pocking of smallpox. A fai lure of the fruit crop in any particularly lar ge area is always followed th e succeeding winter by the presence of smallpox.27 Dr . Cam pbell also applied himself to the elimination of mosquitoes by constructing hu ge bat houses\u2014he was a great admirer of this strange winged creature and knew how to harness its help in the eli mination of annoying insects, assumed to cause malaria.28 Campbell was an inventive and colorful character , full of g ood ideas, yet hardly mentioned in medical journals or in histories of disease. Where' s the glamor of a solution that involves clean beds and fresh fruit compared with the heroics of vaccination \u2014smallpox vaccinations so toxi c that health of ficials no longer recommend them. Dr. Campbell' s Municipal Bat-Roost, which eliminated mosquitos from San Antonio without the use of toxic chemicals. Unlike the for gotten Dr . Campb ell, Dr . Robert Koch is immorta lized as the father of microbiology and the germ theory . Unable to prove that a microor ganism caused cholera,29 and in the case of rabies, knowing that Pasteur was unable to even f ind an or ganism,30 Dr . Koch turned his attention to tuberculosis (TB). According to a historical article published in W orld of Micr obiology and Immunology : In six months, Koch succeeded in isolating a bacillus from tissues of humans and animals infected with tuberculosis. In 1882, he published a paper declaring that this bacillus met his four c onditions\u2014that is, it was isolated from diseased animals, it was grown in a pure culture, it was transferred to a healthy ani mal who then developed the disease, and it was isolated fro m the animal infected by the cu ltured or ganism. When he presented his findings before the Physiologi cal Society in Berlin on March 24, he held the audience spellbound, so logical and thorough was his delivery of this important finding. This day has come to be known as the day modern bacteriology was born.31 In 1905, Dr . Ko ch received the Nobel Prize for proving that TB was an infectious disease. Except he didn' t. In f act, he cou ld find an or ga nism in infected tissue only b y using special staining methods after the tissue was heated and dehydrated with alcohol. The stain was a toxic dy e, methylene blue, and the solution he used contained another toxin\u2014potassium hydroxide (lye). When he injected the or ganism stained with these poisons into animals, they got sic k. But what caused the illness, the bacillus or the poisons?32 An d TB does not even satisfy K och' s fi rst postulate. Only one person in ten who tests positive for TB actually develops the disease; those who don' t are said to have \"latent TB.\" Even into the 1 930s and 1940s, some scientists remained skeptical of the g erm theory for TB\u2014many still believed that the cause was genetic. An investigator who disputed both theories was the dentist W eston A. Price, author o f the groundbreaking book Nutrition and Physical Degeneration .33 During the 1930s and 1940s, he traveled around the globe to study the health of so-called \"primitive peoples,\" living on ancestral diets. As a dentist, he naturally observed dental and facial formation and the presence or absen ce of tooth decay . He found fourteen groups in regions as diverse as the Swiss Alps, the Outer Hebrides, Alaska, South America, Australia, and the Sout h Seas in which every member of the tribe or village exh ibited wide facial structure, naturally straight teeth, and freedom from tooth decay . He also noted the absence of dis ease in these well-nourished groups. As soon as the \"displacing foods of modern commerce\" made inroads into a population, they became vulnerable to both chronic and \"infectious disease,\" especially TB. The children born to those who adopted the W estern diet of \"sanitary\" processed food\u2014sugar , white flour , canned foods, and vegetable oils\u2014were born with more narrow faces, crowded and crooked teeth, pinched nasal p assages, narrow configuration of the birth canal, and less robust body formation. Price re jected the notion that TB was inherited or cause d by a microor ganism, transmittable by droplets released into the air in the coughs and sneezes of the infected; he surmised that the root cause was a malformation of the lungs, similar to the narrowing of the facial structure and \"den tal defo rmities\" in those born to parents eating processed foods. In a visit to a pediatric TB ward in Hawaii, he noted that every patient had dental deformities.34 The se d ental de formities did not cause TB, of course, but Dr . Price be lieved that the same conditions that prevented the optimal formation of the facial bones also prevented optimal formation of the lungs. It w as the dead and dying tissue in the lungs that attracted bacteria, nature' s cleanup crew , and not the microor ganism that caused the disease. He note d that Swiss villagers living of f their native diets of ra w dairy products, sourdough rye bread, and some meat and or gan meats had no TB \u2014and th is was a time when TB was the number -one killer in Switzerland and elsewhere.35 Likewise, inhabitants of Lewis Island in the Outer Hebrides were free of TB. Their nutrient-dense diet consisted of seafood, including fish livers and fish liver oil, along with oat porridge an d oatcakes. They lived in thatched houses that had no chimneys, living in close quarters with smoky , polluted air night a nd day; still they had no TB. When modern foods made their appearance, the situation changed, and TB took hold. Health workers blamed the smoky air of their cottages (not a microor ganism!) and made the m install chimneys, but to no avail. Only W eston A. Price was curious about the fact that the well-nourished islanders were immune, even when living in smoke-filled houses.36 Similarly , he observed that Afric an tribesmen living on traditional foods seemed immune to the diseases in Africa, even though they went barefoot, drank un sanitary water , and lived in areas that swarmed with mosquitos.37 Europeans visiting Africa neede d to cover themselves completely and sleep under p rotective netting to avoid disease. Once the continent of Africa became \"coca-colonized,\" these diseases proliferated among the Africans. During the time of Dr . Price' s research, it was not the s o-called infectious diseases of Africa that struck terror in American minds, it was polio. A ccording to health of ficials, the cause was an infectious virus. This virus did n' t just make people (es pecially young people) sick; it occasionally left them crippled. Pictures of grown men in iron lungs and children wearing leg braces seared the national consciousness. In the mid-1950s, physician Morton S. Biskind testified before Congress. Dr . Biskind' s messag e was not what the legislators wanted to hear: po lio was the result of ce ntral nervous system (CNS) poison, not a virus, and the chief CNS poison of the day was a chemical called dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, commonly known as DDT .38 Used in W orld W ar II to control mosquitos said to cause malaria and typ hus among civilians and troops, its invento r , Paul Herman M\u00fcller ,39 w as awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1948 \"for his discovery of the high ef ficiency of DDT as a contact poison against several anthropods.\" By October 1945, DDT was a vailable for public sale in the United States. Governm ent and industry promoted its use as an agric ultural and household pesticide\u2014really promoted it. Photographs from the era show housewives filli ng their houses with DDT fog; dairy farmers d usting cows in their cowshed s, even spraying it into the milk; crop dusters depositing DDT on fields and forests; an d children on beaches enveloped in the pesticide. An attachment for your mower could distribute DDT over your lawn, and trucks sprayed DDT o n city streets, children cheerfully playing in the spray . DDT lar gely replaced another C NS poison\u2014lead arsenate, introduced in 1898 for use on crops and orchards. Before that, the preferred spray was plain arsenic. Biskind wrote: In 1945, against the advice of investigators who had studied the pharmacology of the compound and found it dangerous for all forms of life, DDT . . . was released in the U nited States and other countries for general use by the public as an insecticide. . . . It was even known by 1945 that DDT is stored in the body fat of mammals and appears in the milk. W ith this foreknowle dge the series of catastrophic events that followed the most inte nsive campaign of mass p oisoning in known human history , should not have surprise d the experts. Y et, far from admitting a causal r elationship so obvious that in any other fi eld of biology it would be in stantly accepted, virtually the entire apparatus of communicatio n, lay and s cientific alike, has been devoted to d enying, concealing, suppressing, distortin g and attempts to convert into its opposite, th e overwhelming evidence. Libel, slander and economic boycott have not been overlooked in this campaign. . . . Early in 1949, as a r esult of studies duri ng the previous year , the author published reports imp licating D DT preparations in t he syndrome widely attributed to a 'virus-X' in man, in 'X-disease' in cattle and in often fatal syndromes in dogs and cats. The relationship was promptly denied by government of ficials, who provided no evidence to contest the author ' s observations but relied solely on the prestige of government authority and sheer numbers of experts to bolster their position. . . .['X-disease'] . . . studied by the author following known exposure to DDT and related compounds and over and over again in the same patients, each time following known exposure. W e have described the syndrom e as follows: . . . . In acute exacerbations, mild clonic convulsions involving mainly the legs, have been observed. Several young ch ildren exposed to DDT developed a limp lasting from 2 or 3 days to a week or more. . . . Particularly relevant to recent aspects of this problem are neglected studies by Lillie and his collaborators of the National Institutes of Health, published in 1944 and 1947 respectively , which showed that DDT may produce degeneration of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord in a nimals. These changes do not occur regularly in exposed anima ls any more than they do in human beings, but they do appear often enough to be significant. When the population is exposed to a chemical agent known to produce in animal s lesions in the spinal c ord resembling those in human polio, and thereafter the latter d isease increases s harply in incidence and mainta ins its epidemic character year after year , is it unreasonable to suspect an etiologic relationship?40 Investigator Jim W est unearthed Biskind' s writings and testimony , along with oth er reports about the ef fe cts of poisons on the CNS, dating from the mid-nineteenth century . W est compiled the following graphs, noting the correlation of pesticide use and polio incidence in the United States.41 As u se of DDT in the United States declined, so did the incid ence of polio. V accination programs w ere introduced at the same time and take credit for the decline. W est says: A cle ar , dir ect, one-to-one relationship between pesticides and polio over a period of thirty years, with pesticide s preceding polio in cidence in the context of ology . room for complicated virus ar guments, even as a cof actor , unless th ere exists a rigorou s proof for virus causation. Polio shows no movement independent from pesticide movement, as one would expect if it were caused by a virus. Both the medical and popular imaginations are haunted by the image of a virus that invades (or infects) and begins replicating to the point of producing disease. In the laboratory , however , poliovirus does not easily behave in such a predatory manner . Laboratory attempts to demonstrate causation are performed under conditions which are extremely artificial and aberrant.42 W est notes that in 1908-1909, German researchers Landsteiner and Popper in Germany claimed to h ave isolated polio virus and use d it to cause polio in monkeys. Their method was to inject a pulverized pur\u00e9e of diseased brain tissue into the brains of two monkeys. One monkey died, and the other was sickened. Headlines trumpeted this \"proof\" of polio virus causation. \"The weakness of this method is obvious to everyone except certain viro-pathologists,\" said W est. Never has \"polio contagion\" passed muster Rivers' postulates.43 The inje ction of pur\u00e9e of disea sed brain tissue into the brains of dogs was the method preferred by Lo uis Pasteur to establish microbial causation of rabies ; and indeed, injecting smooshed brains into their heads often made them foam at the mouth and die. Many of Pasteur ' s con temporaries disagreed strong ly that rabies ( also called hydrophobia) was a contagious disease a nd poin ted out that the vaccine often caused great harm to animals and people\u2014even Pasteur ' s c ontemporary germ theorist R obert Koch discouraged the use of the rabies vaccine.44 V ets of the era believed that dogs became \"rabid\" when they were starved and mistreated. Dr . Matthew W oods o f Philad elphia noted that \"at the Philadelphia dog pound, where on average more than 6,000 vagrant dogs are taken annually , and where the catcher a nd keep ers are frequently bitten while handling them, not one case of hydrophobia [rabies] has occurred during its entire history of twenty-five years, in which time 150,000 dogs have been handled.\"45 Dur ing the 1960 s, researchers succeeded in inducing symptoms of rabies in experimental animals by putting them in bat caverns where they could breathe the toxic stultifying vapor s of bat guano, later claiming to have isolated an \"airborne rabies virus.\" T o test whether this so-called \"virus\" caused rabies, one researcher \"inoculated [mice] intracerebrally .\" Fifty percent died within forty-eight hours, but none developed rabies.46 As for polio, ev en with worldwide vaccination programs, polio has not gone aw ay , either in the United States or in third world countries. T oday in the United States, it has received a new name\u2014acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), displaying symptoms identical to polio\u2014with over two hundred cases re corded in 2018. Many parents have observed that the condition appears after a vaccination. CDC' s pathetic advice: \"T o prevent infections in gener al, perso ns should stay home if they are ill, wash their hands often with soap and w ater , avoid close contact (such as touching and shaking hands) w ith those who are ill, and clean and disinfect frequen tly touched surfaces.\"47 In some areas of the world, such as India and Africa, the incid ence of acute flaccid paralysis has skyro cketed, which many blame on c ampaigns to administer experimental polio vaccines to children ages zero to five. Indian researchers described this strong correlation in a 2018 publication in the International Jo urnal of Envir onmental Resear ch and Public Health and calculated that, countrywide from 2000 to 2017, there were \"an additional 491,000 paralyzed children\" in excess of \"the expected numbers.\"48 Dr . Suzanne Humphries suggests that\u2014far from credit for eliminating child hood paralysis going to vaccination campaign s\u2014\"there is strong evidence pointing to the likelihood that experimental polio vaccination is related to the sharp rise in AFP .\"49 If th e true cause of epidemics is exposure to electrical pollu tion or toxins (from insects, industrial poisons, toxins produced by bacteria under conditions of filth, vaccinations, and drugs), with substandard n utrition as a cofactor , what about the outbreaks of disease in the Americas , in Africa, and in the South Seas, when these aboriginal peoples first met the European colonists? Didn ' t they begin to suf fer from infectious disease as soon as they came in contact with infectious diseases carried to the New W orld on boats from the Old W orld\u2014diseases to which they had no immunity? Actually , native peoples did not contrac t disease immediately on contact with the Europeans. For example, fishermen and early explorers visited the northeastern waters along the Atlantic coast during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, yet we have no historical commentary on the existence of d isease or e pidemics among the aboriginal peoples during that time. According to Raymond Obomsawin, in his report \"Historical an d Scientific Perspectives on the Health of Canada' s first Peoples,50 \" Since the prime purpose of this early contact was to commercially exploit natural resources, any visible evidence of the phys ical weakness or sickness of the indigenous inhabitants would surely have excited some keen interest.\" Instead, these early re ports marveled at the N ative Americans' good health and robust constitution. Obomsawin notes that the first recorded outbreaks of disease in Native Americans living in the Ottawa V alleys occurred between 1734 and 1741. Samuel de Champlain had est ablished the first European settlement at Quebec on the St. Lawrence River over one hundred years earlier , in 1608, and it wasn' t until the 1800s that smallpox, dysentery , typhus, y ellow fever , tuberculosis, syp hilis, and various other \"fevers\" became prevalent in the aboriginal population. By the mid-eighteenth century , Native American life had succumbed to serious d isruptions. As a result of intensive trapping, the game populations had dwi ndled, se riously af fectin g the availability of food and skins to make clothing and footwear . During this period, sugar , white flour , cof fee, tea, and alco hol arrived on trading ships, which the colonists trad ed with the Indians for furs. The sam e pattern prevailed on the W est Coast, where the salmon fisheries became depleted by the mid-1800s. These northwest peoples spoke of \"disease boats\" or \"p estilence canoes,\" the Spanish and British seagoing vessels that arrived with increasing frequency . They brought smallpox, but also the foods that made them vulnerable to smallpox. An early one-hundre d-foot sailing car go vessel could transport as much as eight hundred thousan d pounds of \"goods\"\u2014or maybe we should say \"bads\"\u2014 including blankets for the Native Americans.51 T ribal peoples lar gely depende nt upon the falo were not af fected until the early 1870s, when the animals became depleted through exploitation and deliberate campaigns to kill of f the herds upon which they depended. According to a Canadian government report: The transfo rmation of Aboriginal people f rom the state of good health that had impressed travelers fr om Europe to one of ill health . . . grew worse as sources of food and clothing from the land declined and traditional economies collapsed. It grew worse still as once mobile peo ples were confined to small plots of land where resources and opportunities for natural san itation were limited. It worsen ed yet again as long-standing norms, values, social systems and spiritual practices were undermined or outlawed.52 Regarding the Plymouth colony , the Pilgrims were not t he first Europeans in the area. Europea n fishermen had been sailing of f the New England coast, with considerabl e Native American contact, for much of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and trading for beaver skins commenced in the early 1600s, prior to the arrival of the Pilgrims in 1620. In 1605, the Frenchman Samuel de Champlain made an extensive and detailed map of the area and the surrounding lands, showing the Patuxet village (site of the future town of Plymouth) as a thriving settlement. In 1617- 1618, just prior to the arrival of the Mayflower , a mysterious epidemic wiped out up to 90 p ercent of the Indian population along the Massachusetts c oast. History books blame the epidemic on smallpox, but a recent analysis has concluded that it may have been a dis ease called leptospirosis.53 Even today , leptospirosis kills almost sixty thousand people per year . Leptospirosis is a blood infection similar to malaria, associated with various forms of spirochaete bacteria. Other forms of spirochete parasites characterize syphilis, yaws, and L yme disease. Humans encounter these spirochetes through animal urine or water and soil contaminated with animal u rine co ming into contact with the eyes, mouth, nose, or cuts. The disease is associated with poor sanitation. Both wild and domestic animals can transmit leptospirosis throu gh their urine and other fluids; rodents are the most common vector , and the beaver is a rodent. Native Americans trade beaver skins with European colonists for liquor and other items that made them vulnerable to disease. One important factor omitted from discussions about Native American diseases is the d isruption of the salt trade. The first European explorers in the New W orld did not come to the East Coast but to Flor ida and the southeastern part of North America. During the 1540s, eighty years before the P ilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock, the explorer Hernando de Soto led the first European expedition deep into the territory of the modern-day United States. They traversed Florida, Geor gia, Alabama, and possibly Arkansas, and they saw the Mississippi River . Some an thropologists have insi sted that the Native Americans did not consume salt, but de Soto received \"an abundance of good salt\" as a gift from the Native Americans, an d he observed the production a nd trade of salt in the southeastern part of t he country . In the lower Mississ ippi V alley , he met traveling Native American merchants selling salt. According to the de Soto records, lack of salt could lead to a most unfortunate death: Some of those whose constitutions must ha ve demanded salt more than others died a most unusual death for lack of it. They were seized with a very slow fever , on the third or fourth day o f whi ch there was no one at fifty feet could endure the stench of their bodies, it being more of fensive than that of the carcasses of dogs or cats. Thus they perished withoutremedy , fo r they were ignorant as to what t heir malady might be or what could be done for them since they had n either physicians nor medicines. And it was believed that they could not ha ve be nefited from such had they pos sessed them because from the moment they first felt the fever , their bodies were already in a state of decomposition. Indeed, from the chest down, their bellies and intestines were as green as grass.54 The most important sources of salt were the salt springs that dotted northwestern Louisiana, western Arkansas, and the Ohio River V alley . Archeological r emains in these areas indicate that the Native Americans evaporated the brine in shallow clay salt pans, most likely by adding hot rocks to the brackish water . They also retrieved salt from ashes of certain plants and from salt-impregnate d sand; they sometimes gathered rock salt. W ell-defined salt trails allowed the transport of salt to the east. Coastal Native America ns generally got their salt through trade rather than the evaporation of seawater , as wo od for fire making is sparse near ocean beaches, and the moist sea air is unconducive to evaporation.55 The salt traders did not belong to any tribal group but traveled alone from tribe to tribe carrying baskets of salt gathered from salt lakes, along with oth er good s. As Native Am erican cultural life crumbled in the face of the Euro pean in vasion, the salt trade would have been an early victim of this disruption. Salt is critical fo r protection against parasites. W e need the chloride in salt to make hydrochloric acid; without salt, the stomach will not be suf ficiently acidic to kill parasites. The poin t is that the so-called \"i nfectious\" diseases that caused so much suf fering did not arrive until a fter a period of disruption and nutritional decline; and fear and despair almost certainly played a role. When disease broke ou t in a village, the af flicted often found themselves ab andoned by those sti ll healthy , so they had no one to care for them. Unable to get water for themselves, they typically died of thirst.56 T his may expl ain why the death ra tes durin g outbreaks were so much higher for the Native Americans (typically 90 percent) than for Europeans (typically 30 percent). One disease blamed for Native American death was measles, considered to be a v iral dise ase. But on February 16, 2016, the Federal Sup reme Court of Germ any (B GH) made a hi storic ruling: there is no evide nce for the existence of a m easles virus. The case grew out of a challenge by German biologist Stefan Lanka, who of f ered a sum of one hundred thousand Euros to anyone who could supply proof that the measles virus existed. A young doctor , D avid Bardens, took up the challenge, providing Lanka with six studies as proof that the measles virus did indeed exist. W hen Lanka claimed that these studies did not meet the evidence needed to claim the prize, Bardens took him to court. The court sided with Bardens and ordered payment of the prize. But Lanka took the cases to the Supreme Court, where th e judge decided in his favor and ordered the plaintif f to bear all the procedural costs. Lanka was able to show t hat the six studies misinterpreted \"ordinary constituents of cells\" as part of the suspected measles virus.57 According to Lanka, decades of consensus-building processes have created a model of a measles virus that doesn' t actually exist: \"T o this day , an a ctual structure that correspo nds to this model has been found neither in a hu man, nor in an animal. W ith the results of the genetic tests, all thesis of existence of measles virus has been scientifically disproved.\"58 The existence of a contagious m easles virus justified the development of the measles vaccine, which has earned the pharmaceutical industry billions of dollars over a forty-year period. But if such a mic roor ganism does not exist, said Lanka, \"This raises the question of what w as actually injected into millions of German citizens over the past decades. According to th e judgment by the Supreme Court, it may not have bee n a vaccine against measles.\"59 But what about measles partie s? What about successful attempts by parents to infect their children with the common childhood diseases like measles, chicke n pox, and mumps? And what about sexually transmitted diseases (STD) like syphilis\u2014 said to be a disease that the Europeans contracted from the Native Americans? The mystery of childhood illnesses and sexually transmitted diseases will be addressed in chapter 7 . CHAPTER 4 F R O M A I D S T O C O V I D T o understand the story of coronavirus, it' s instructive to go back to 1971. That was the year that President Nixon declared the W ar on Cancer . The theory of the day was that viruses caused cancer , and the medical establishment vo wed they would find a cure by 1975. Hundreds of millions of dollar s \"flowed into a compl etely one-sided cancer research focused on wonder -drug production.\"1 Of cours e, the war was a compl ete failure, and by the early 1980s, NIH scientists were scrambling to obtain continued funding and the CDC \"needed a major epidemic to justify its existence.\"2 Enter AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), said to be caused by HIV (Human Imm unodeficiency V irus), a deadly virus that \"made th e jump from other prim ates to humans in west-central A frica in the early-to-mid [twentieth] century .\"3 Some predicted that as an STD, AIDS would eventually spread through the whole population and kill us all. Between 1981 and 2006, almost two hundred billion dollars was invested in AIDS research, focused on the virus hypothesis and developm ent of toxic antiviral drugs like AZT . Many books4 have carefully d ocumented the case against the claim that a virus called H IV causes the disease called AIDS. Unfortunately , these careful a r guments seem to make no dif ference to the man on the street\u2014nor to scien tists, for that matter . In essence, no matter what the evidence, 99 percent of the population, including most of the alternative medical community , still believe in this myth. Let' s loo k at the facts. AIDS w as not a disease new to the 19 70s and early 19 80s. In fact, it is the same disease as the condition caused by immune-suppressive drugs used to prevent people from rejecting or gans such as a heart or kidney after a transplant. The only thing new about the disease was the appearance of a new type of cancer called Kaposi' s sarcoma. AIDS is not a specific disease at all. It simply means a collapse of the cell-mediate d immune system, known, even in the 1970s, to have many diverse causes. W ith the collapse of the immune system, you see conditions like freq uent infections, TB, mononucleosis, peripheral neuropathy , and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome\u2014all of which often come under the rubric of AIDS. The new part of the disease, Kaposi' s sarcoma, has been def initively linked t o the use of \"poppers\" (alkyl nitrite drugs), which are immune- suppressive. Th is drug was used to relax the anal sphincter and facilitate anal intercourse. The vast majority of people who got Kaposi' s sarcoma were ga y men who used poppe rs (never people who \"acquired the virus\" from any other source). Once the use of poppers stopped in the gay community , so did Kaposi' s sarcoma. In spite of forty years of resea rch, no one has isolated an HIV virus from any bodily fluid of a person suf fering from AIDS. Not once. This is shocking for most people to hear , but cash awards are available for anyone who can show with an electron microscope purified HIV virus isolated from anyone with AIDS. Up to this point, no one has collected these cash awards. No one has eve r documented transmission of any purified HIV virus from on e person or one animal to another with any resultant sickness. Notonce. In fact, th e biggest study on AIDS ever carried out5 clearly showed that HIV is not transmissible through sexual contact. And, finally , as we will discuss in chapter 5 , the test used to make a \"diagnosis\" of AIDS can never det ermine causation. It is sim ply a test looking for genetic material of unknown origin. Since we have no proof that any virus or b acteria has ever caused any disease, the test is simply irrelevant for determining causation. When th e test for AIDS\u2014called the PCR test\u2014finds a higher level of genetic p articles in the blood, it simply means that the person' s condition is causing a lot of genetic deterioration\u2014from toxins, EMF poisoning, malnutrition, or stress. The test can never determine the cause of the illness. If on e first isola ted, purified, and characterized the entire gen ome of the virus in question , then one coul d determine whether the snippet of genetic material you are looking for is unique to that virus in question. Absent doing a purifica tion, isolation, and characterization step, there is simply no way to say that the snippet you are looking at is either unique to that virus or even originated in that virus. If you poison an or ganism with any type of toxin that degrades your cells (which most poisons do, including EMF poisons6), th en m ore gen etic material will be found in your blood and the PCR test will pick this up. This means you are sick. This also applies to antibodies: the more poisoned you are, the more a ntibodies you tend to produce to protect yourself. This simple fact explains why all PCR and antibody tests, including those for HIV and the coronavirus, tend to show higher \"viral loads\" (which are not viruses but genetic material) and to be more positive in sicker people. It doesn' t m ean the y have a viral infection; it means they are sick. This is why the package insert for PCR and antibody tests for both HIV and coronavirus say that you may get a false po sitive if the person has one of about forty conditions. The se include strep throat, \"viral infections,\" a utoimmune disease, cancer , pregnancy , or nursing. In other words, any s tress on the body provokes us to make more antibodies and have more degraded genetic material in our blood and other fluids\u2014 no surprise there. There is nothing in these tests that either prov es viral causation or , absent purification, proves that the PCR snippet even came from the virus in question\u2014 nothing . It is sim ply a house of cards. (For more on on testing, see chapter 5 .) Since th ese facts are obvious and easily proven, how can they have escaped the scrutiny of the \"brilliant\" men and women who run our health- care system and populate the ranks of virologists? Once our health authorities declared that the multifactorial condition called \"AIDS\" was caused by a virus, they needed to come up with a way to treat it. The pharmaceutical companies (in particular , Burroughs- W ellcome), dusted of f an old and very toxic drug called azidothymidine (AZT) and remarketed it for use with AIDS patients. AZT is a nucleo side analogue drug; it interferes with the production of DNA from the RNA supposedly contained in the HIV virus. The theory is that without the ability of the H IV virus to make copies of DNA, it can' t grow , re plicate, and cause infection and disease. In practice, not only did AZT show much of the toxicity associated with cancer chemotherapy drugs (many o f which also interfere with some aspect of DNA replication), it was shown t o be worse than wort hless in preventing the progression from asymptomatic to full-blown AIDS. In th e first trial of AZT on asymptomatic HIV -positive people, AZT was given to 877 people, while 8 72 received a placebo. As soon as a patient developed any AIDS symptoms, he or she (15 percent were wo men) would be of fered \"open label\" AZT . The mortality rates were shocking; over the three ye ars of the trial, there we re seventy-nine AIDS-related deaths in the AZT gro up, but only 67 patients in the placebo group. So not on ly were you more lik ely to develop symptomatic AIDS if you took AZT compared to doing no thing, you were also subjected to all the usual toxicity of taking a chemotherapy drug.7 Adverse ef fects of AZT includ e nausea, vomiting, acid reflux (heart- burn), headache , sleep problems, and loss of appetite. Long-term adverse ef fects include anemia, neutropenia (low white blood cells), hepatotoxicity (liver toxicity), cardiomyopathy (problems with the heart muscle), and myopathy (muscle weakness). There are many parallels with today' s situation in which \"antiviral\" drugs actually increase the like lihood of having a bad outcome from this imaginary viral disease called coronavirus. In the wake of A IDS followed other \"viral\" diseases, including hepatitis C, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), bird fl u, swine flu, Ebola, and Zika. Great sums were dedicated to finding vir al causes and one-drug-fits-al l cures, all following a familiar playbook: inventing t he risk of a disastrous epidemic, incriminating an elusive pathogen, ign oring alternative toxic causes, manipulating epidemiology with non-verifiable numbers to maximize the false p erception of an imm inent catastrophe, and promising salvation with vaccines. T his guaran tees lar ge financial returns. But how is it possible to achieve all of this? Simp ly by relying on the most powerful activator of human decision-making p rocess \u2014FEAR!8 Needless to say , researchers ha ve yet to prove that a virus ca uses any of these conditions. Fast-forward to November 2019, when authorities in China noti ced that a group of people were getting sick in a new way . They notice d that many of the people w ho contracted this illness reported visiting a particular fish market in W uhan, China. Th e symptoms were respiratory in nature, including dry cough. Of course, these symptoms are not altoge ther new , as people throughout history have suf fered from a variety of respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, pneumonia, and asthma. Still, as the number of cases inc reased, authorities look ed into the situation. There was a suspicion that a new disease had appeared, which naturally triggered a search for the cause. Because the symptoms of the s ick people resembled pneumonia, some of the original p atients received antibiotics. This was done bec ause one of the recent \"postulates\" proving causation of an infectious disease states that if antibiotics fail to resolve the symptoms, this constitutes \"presumptive\" evidence (rather than \"direct\" e vidence) that the pneumonia is caused by a virus (w hich obviously doesn' t respond to antibiotic therapy) . Since the patients didn' t improve with ant ibiotic therapy , this triggered the hypothesis that the new type of pneumonia must be caused by a new or modified virus. Let' s co nsider our original ping-pong ball example given in chapter 1 . The who le issue at this point revolves around whether the viral causation of this new set of symptoms can be proven. W e want and should de mand proof of causa tion, no t a ping-pong ball in a bucket of stones and ice cubes, a computer simulation, an analysis of the virus, or the testimony of experts. W e are betting our lives, our children, the world economy , and much more on th e weight of the evidence. W e need rock-solid proof; we need to follow the Koc h' s or Rivers' postulates, which entail a simple line of reasoning that any rational human being can recognize as the way to prove infectious causation. In other words, here is what should have happened in early 2020. As soon as the Chinese medica l authorities suspected an outbreak of a new and dangerous disease, the y should have collected about f ive hundred people w ith identical, or at lea st nearly identical, symptoms. Then they should have identified another group of equal size as matched controls\u2014 that is, people of a similar age, lifestyle and background, also from W uhan, who had no sym ptoms. Given the possible slow development of this illness, it would have been prudent to follow the five hundred control people over at least a few months to make sure that none developed these new symptoms. The next step w ould be to do a thorough microbiological exam ination of a variety of fluids taken from these one thousand subjects. At a minimum, this should have inclu ded blood, sputum, urine, and n asal swabs. The examination should have included conventional light microscopy to look for bacteria and electron microscopy to look for viruses. Once a novel ba cteria or virus was found in all th e sick people and none of the well peo ple, the bacteria or virus should have been m eticulously isolated, purified, and cultured in a neutral medium (which is actually not possible for viruses, since they \"grow\" only in other living cells). Once this purification step was accomplished, the purified microbe should have been introduced into a test animal in the normal way that one suspected the microbe might be spreading\u2014by airborne droplets\u2014 not injected directly into the brain o f the animal as scientists like Pasteur did to \"prove\" the contagious etiology of rabies, TB, or polio. Finally , a control group of test animals should have been subj ected to the sam e attemp ts at contamination. In other words, if you are going to spray pu rified v irus into the ani mals' nostrils to see whether th ey get sick, you need to spray pure saline in to the nostrils of a control group of animals to make sure the animals are not getting sick just because you are spraying stuf f up their noses. Any sane and logical person would agree that this is what should have happened. Final ly , if for some reason the medical authorities in China were unable t o carry out such an inve stigation, they should have enlisted the help of th e C DC and the equivalent or ganizations in Europe and Russia, or the W orld H ealth Or ganization (WHO), to make sure the investigations were done carefully , properly , and thoroughly . The ama zing part of this story is that not only do we lack this kind of evidence for a v iral cause of Covid-19, we also lack this kind of evidence for the many \"viral\" epidemics we have faced during the last century ,1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.including polio, AIDS, SARS, Ebola, Zika, and hepatitis C. In fact, not a single part of this clear and simple proof has been attempted. Let' s look then at what was done to prove that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV -2) was the cause of this new set of symp toms. Four papers published in China are cited a s proof that the new and novel coronavirus is the probable cause of this new disease.9 For an in-depth analysis of these papers, please refer to a pres entation by Andrew Kaufman MD,10 in whic h he dissects in great d etail the methods and conclusions of these seminal studies. T o revie w these four studies, le t' s look again at Rivers' postulates for determining whether a particular virus causes a disease. The virus can be isolated from diseased hosts. The virus can be cultivated in host cells. Proof of filterability\u2014the virus can be filtered from a medium that also contained bacteria. The filtered virus will produce a comparable disease when the cultivated virus is used to infect experimental animals. The virus can be re-isolated from the infected experimental animal. A specific immune response to the virus can be detected. None of these four studies met all six postulates. Of the four studies said to pr ove that a coronavirus causes this disease, not one of them satisfied the first thre e postu lates, and none of them even addressed postulates four and five. One paper claimed to find an immune response (postulate six) by looking at antibody levels from the patient. The firs t two papers are honest enough to claim only an associ ation of coronavirus and the disease; the third paper claims that the coronavirus is \"identified as the causative ag ent.\" The fourth paper , from McMaster University , falsely claims that the coronavirus is t he cau sative ag ent of the disease a nd that the virus \"set in motion the pandemic,\" with no evidence to back up these statements. These papers never show that all the people with Covid-19 had the same set of symptom s; they never p urify any virus from the sick people; they never demonstrate the absence of the virus from well people; and they never sh ow that the transmission of purified virus could make well people become sick. This is scientific fraud of the first order . It' s i nteresting to look more clo sely at how virologists work to \"prove\" something like causation by cor onavirus. One example is a pape r published in 2003 in Natur e , titled \"Koch' s Postulates Fulf illed for SARS V irus.\"1 1 Researchers claimed that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome i s caused by a coronavirus. The title itself is misleading, if not dishonest, because the researchers satisfied neither Koch' s nor Rivers' postulates. Here' s w hat they did: first they took respiratory secretions from some sick peo ple; in other words, they took sputum from people with a cough. They centrifuge d the sputum, which separates the cellular part (where presumably the virus is residin g in the cells) from the liquid part. They discarded the liquid part. This is what they referred to as \"purification.\" Then th ey took this centrifuged, unpurified sediment from sick people, containing God-only-knows-wh at, and inoculated that into ve ro (monkey kidney) cells. Here we have to understand that if virologists want to get enough \"virus\" to use experimentally , they must grow it in a biological medium such as an animal or at least cells from an animal. Unl ike bacteria, which can be g rown in petri dishes, viruses are not alive, and they can \"grow\" only in other living cells. For convenience and because cancer cell lines are \"immortal,\" they gene rally grow their \"viruses\" in c ancer cells; however , in this case they used kidney cells. This practice is f raught with obvious problems for proving it is the virus and not the kidne y or cancer cells tha t are causing disease when these viruses then get injected into the test animals. Also, it is well known now that as part of their \"detoxification\" strategy , cells, especially cancer cells produce particles called exosomes , which are identical to \"viruses.\" (More on this in chapter 6 .) Again, t he researchers took unpurified sediment from the nasal mucus of sick people and grew that in v ero cells until they got a suf ficient quantity of ce llular material to work with. Then they centrifuged this mess again, not even atte mpting to purify any vi rus from the mixture. Finally , th ey took this witch' s b rew of snot sediment, kidney cells, and who-knows-what-else and injected that into two monkeys. They didn' t do a control group by injecting saline in to other monkeys or injecting vero cells into monke ys, or even injecting the liquid supernatant from the centrifuged material into monkeys. They just injected this cellular - debris-laden goop. One monkey developed pneumonia and the other appea red to have respiratory symptoms possibly related to a lower respiratory d isease. That, claim the researchers, is the proof that a \"coronavirus\" can cause disease. T o be fair , in a related study ,12 r esearc hers did the exact sa me procedure, except to make it more reflective of how the new \"virus\" actually spreads, they took unpurified, lung-cancer -grown, centrifuged snot and (aga in, with out any controls) squirted it down the throats and into the lungs of hamsters. (Where is PET A when you need them?) Some, but not all, of the hamsters got pneumo nia, and some died. W e have no idea what would h ave hap pened if they h ad squirted plain lung cancer c ells into the lungs of these hamsters, but pr obably not anything good. And even more perplexing, som e of the hamster s didn' t even get sick at all, whi ch certainly doesn' t square with the deadly , contagious virus theory . In short , no study has proven t hat coronavirus, or indeed any virus is contagious, nor has any study p roven anything except that virologists are a dangerous, misguided group of people and that hamster - and monkey-rights people are not doing their jobs! This story is analogous to \"prov ing\" that the ping-pong ball ca n knock down w alls by throwing a bucket of rocks and ice cubes contain ing a single ball at a small w all and showing that this does knock down the wall. These \"proofs\" make no sense and prove nothing, and yet the whole edifice of corona \" virus\" causation rests on these bogus studies. In chapter 5 , we will deconstruct the equally bogus \"testing\" now used to provide what passes for supportive evide nce of a viral causation. Stay with us, the ride gets more interesting as we go.CHAPTER 5 T E S T I N G S C A M In a series of recent articles pub lished in local and national new s media, as well as in vario us scientific papers, some of the world' s leading medical doctors and immunologists have made surprisingly honest\u2014an d shocking \u2014statements ab out coronavirus testing. The test used is called a PCR test\u2014 PCR means polymerase chain reaction. Here are some samp les of these statements: \"W e did not perform tests for detecting infectious virus in the blood.\"1 This statement came from a paper in which the authors allege they had discovered the novel coronavirus in patients suf fering from Covid-19. \"There is no way to tell whether the RNA being used in t he new coronavirus PCR test is found in these particles seen under the electron microscope. There is no connection between the test and the particles, and no proof that the particles are viral.\"2 Ironically , this statement does not come from a p aper attempting to debunk the coronavirus causation of Covid-19. It comes from a pape r that adamantly espouses this connection, but w hich claims that more rese arch is needed to understand the interesting intricacies of this new virus. Or t his, from the head of the M arin County Public Health Dep artment, char ged with making public health policy for Marin County , California: \"The PCR tests means you either are infected with the novel coronavirus or you are not infected with the vi rus.\"3 Such a statement is akin to going to the r efrigerator store to purchase a new refrigerator and asking the salesman about a new m odel in the sho wroom. He says to you, \"It' s a new and interesting model; it will either keep the food cool or it won' t.\" Most people would n ot choo se to elevate thi s person to head of refrigeratio n for Marin County . An NBC news feed reported on certain puzzling results: sailors who test positive, then negative, then pos itive for Covid-19 using the PCR test. This should n ot happ en if the test is any good. A CDC representative stated, \"Detection of viral RNA does n ot necessarily mean that infectious virus is present.\"4 According to one infectious disease expert at V anderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, \"It ' s possible that people could she d remnants of the virus for some period of time. That doesn' t mean anythi ng is wrong with them or that they are contagious.\"5 These st atements are all referring to the test used to claim that a person is infect ed and can spread the disease! When asked about these statements, the head of a lab that specializes in testing for infectious disease told us: \"A positive PCR test means you have active disease or you are a carrier and don' t have active disease.\" When we asked how to distinguish between those wh o have active disease and those who are carriers, she confidently replied: \"Those with active disease are sick, the carriers are well.\" Then we asked how one knows whether sickness is caused by the virus, since the test can be positive whether or not you are sick. She replied, \"Y ou can do a PCR test and find ou t whether the sick person has the virus.\" W elcome to the Alice-in-W onderland world of virology! Finally , the most revealing qu ote of all, this one from the chief of infectious diseas es at W ake Forest Baptist Health in W inston-Salem, North Carolina: \"W e just don' t have enough details yet to make confident statements about immunology .\"6 This quote is by an immunol ogist, and immunologists a re the ones deci ding public policy . They have p ut the world under ho use arr est. It would be nice if they could at least confidently say they knew something about immunology . How did this shocking situation concerning tests for viral diseases come about? L et' s ret urn to the story of Stefan Lanka, PhD, a virologist from Germany , whom we discussed in chapter 3 . L anka' s work has helped cut through the veils behind which the field of virology is shrouded. As a young g raduate student in Germany , Lanka made the chance discovery of the f irst virus in seawater . Using electron microscopy in his studies of sea algae, he noticed that the algae contained \"particles.\" T o find ou t what these particles were, and knowing that no one had described viruses living within healthy algae before, he proceeded as follows: He ground up the algae in a sort of blender , essentially to b reak apart the walls of the algae. Then he purified this mixture using an extremely fine filter to separate out particles the size of viru ses from everything else. In this way , he obtained a pure solution of water and viruses and anything else that is the size of a virus or smaller . Then he put this mixtu re into a density-gradient centrifuge, which spins the solutio n and allows th e particles to separate out into bands. The final step uses a micropipette to suck out the band that contains only the virus.7 T his simple pro cedure is the gold standard for the purification and isolation of a vir us from any tiss ue or solution. It' s not an easy process, but it is not unduly dif ficult either . He c ould then s tudy this purified virus under an electron mic roscope, elucidate its shape and structure, analyze the genome, and ascertain which proteins it contained. W ith this work, he could confidently state he had discovered a new virus and was sure of its makeup. For this discovery , he received his doctorate and was about to embark on a promising career as a virologist. The only part o f Lanka' s experiment that surprised him was that in studying the interaction of algae with this new virus, he was for ced to come to th e conclusion that algae co ntaining the virus were thriving and were much h ealthier than the algae without the virus, which were barely surviving. He may have been th e first to come to the conclusion that real viruses in the bo dies of other sp ecies are not pathogens (as was thought at the time ) but rather are integral to the healthy functioning of the host. In essence, he was one of the fir st to propose that in addition to having a microbiome insi de us, we also have a vir ome ; and without th is virome, we cannot be healthy . This was a r adical concept in the 1980s, as no one else had proposed such a theory . If w e compare t he simple, logical, straightforward way in which Lanka isolated, purified , and characterized his virus, with the description of how modern virologists propagate v iruses now , one begins to see the problem and con fusion around testing for viral diseases. When Lanka realized that workers in the f ield of modern virology were never isolating, purifying, or properly characterizing \"viruses\" but instead confusing what they were finding with artifacts made by their propagation techniques, he naturally questioned whether the viruses that supposedly were causing disease even existed. His question was not so much about whether viruses are infectious entities, but something even more fundamental\u2014whether these viruses even exist at all. Compare Lanka ' s careful work with how current virologists find and characterize viruses, including the \"novel coronavirus.\" They start with sputum from a s ick person, having no idea how this person got sick. They centrifuge but do not filter the sputum. This is not a purification process, as they readily admit in all of the papers written about the \"coronavirus.\" Here' s w hat the authors of the o riginal papers that found and lin ked the \"novel\" coronavirus (SARS-CoV -2) to the disease now called \"Covid-19\" have to say . The following quotations come from the brilliant paper \"Covid- 19 P CR T ests ar e Scientifically Meaningless,\" by T orsten Englebrecht and Konstantin Demeter .8 Referring to a p ublished image in a paper claiming to have is olated a new viru s, they say , \"The image is the virus budding from an in fected cell. It is not purified virus.\" If it' s not purifi ed virus, how d o the authors know whether or not it is even a virus, what it is, or where it came from?9 In the paper \"Identification of Coronavirus Isolated from a Patient in Korea with Covid-19,\" the authors stated: \"W e could not estimate the degree of purification because w e do not purify and concentra te the virus cultured in cells.\" In other words , they did not isolate the virus, e ven though they claim to do so in the title.10 In th e article \"V irus Isolated from the First Patient with SARSC oV -2 in Korea,\" the authors admitted, \"W e did not obtain an electron micrograph showing the degree of purification.\"1 1 I n other words, the authors hav e no idea whether or not the sample is purified, as an electron micrograph is the only wa y to determ ine that. They then claim to have characteri zed the genetic m aterial of something they never purified, having no idea what they were loo king at. This was an important study , as it describes the first case of \"Covid-19\" in Korea. Finally , the article \"A Novel Coronavirus from Patients with Pne umonia in China ,\" states: \"W e show an image of sedimented virus particles, not purified ones.\"12 The researchers took nasal mucus (\"snot\") from sick people, centrifug ed it (which is not a purification step) and then sh owed a fuzzy picture of what they found. Then they carried out a \"genetic analysis\" of this sediment in order to characterize the \"novel\" coronavirus . This piece of fraud was published in the esteemed New England Journal of Medicine . What is in the centrifuged ma terial that these papers describe? The centrifuged material contains bacteria and perhaps viruses, fungi, human cells, cell debris, and anything e lse found in the lungs or sinus p assages of a sick person. Researchers then inoculate this unpurified mess onto \"living tissue\" to make it \"grow .\" So metimes this tissue is lung cancer tissue, sometimes abort ed fetal tissue, a nd sometimes tissue from monkey kidneys. In a ny case, it is a complex m ixture of many components, known and unknown. And then because th is \"virulent, infectious virus\" won' t infect and kill this livi ng tissue unless you starve and poison the tissu e first, you deprive the tissue of nutrients and add oxidizing agents to \"w eaken\" the tissue. T hen you add antibiotics to make sure it' s not bacteria that is killing the tissue. The tiss ue from this treatment n aturally disintegrates into thou sands of components. Then you centrifuge this mess again to find your \"virus.\" At that poin t, you start the PCR te sting to determine the genetic and protein makeup of this \"virus.\" The problem is that (unlike the clear s ituation that Lanka e ncountered) in this slapdash way , you never have the isolated intact \"virus\" as a reference to allow you to know which genetic parts of your unpurified mes s actually belong to the \"virus\" you are trying to characterize. As m entioned in chapter 3 , aft er studying the way in which virologists said they had fo und the measles virus\u2014without isolating and purifying it, and actu ally deciding on the genetic makeup by consensus\u2014Lanka of fered a prize of one hundred thousand Euros to anyone who could demonstrate its existence. In the first court to hear the proceedings, the claimant for the prize won the ca se, the judge co ncluding that proof of the measles virus did indeed exist. However , the Germ an Supreme Court, with its mo re stringent rules of evidenc e and the appo intment of a science master to oversee the case, ruled that the claimant, in fact, did not p rove the exis tence of the measles virus. Lanka did not have to pay the claim. How is Lanka' s work relevant to the current test used to de tect the presence of viruses, specifically for the coronavirus? Clearly , if one can' t prove that the coronavirus even exists and that the testing for this imaginary virus is bogus, then the world h as been led wildly astray . If the test for the coronavirus is inaccurate and m isleading, as is the case, then there are no grounds for believing the report s about the number of Covid-1 9 cases, the number of Covid-19 deaths, or any other statistics coming from the orthodox medical institutions. If the testing is bogus, then the coronavirus emperor has no clothes. Let' s contrast Lanka' s elegant experiments with the testing procedures used to determine the alleged presence of coronavirus (SARSCoV -2) \"infection.\" The firs t thing we need to understand about a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test is that it is a surro gate test\u2014it does not find a virus; rather , it finds something else said to indicate the presence of the virus. A surrogate test is one that is generally easier and less expensive to perfo rm and can stand in for the gold-standard test (of actually finding the virus) and thereby make the clinical practice of medicine easier , safer , and cheaper . For example, pulmonary emboli result from blood clots that travel to the lungs. Symptom s include chest pain and shortness of breath. Pulmonary emboli c an be fatal. It is important to diagnose the condition early , as it can be tr eated with b lood thinners. It is also important to diagnose ac curately , as pulmonary emboli share many symptoms with heart attacks and pneumonia, which call for dif ferent kinds of treatment. Fortunately , there is a test that is 100 percent reliable for finding pulmonary emboli when preformed properly . The procedure, called an angiogram, involves inserting a catheter into the arteries of the lungs. Then the r adiologist injects dye into the artery; the dye contains heavy metals that one can see on an X-ray . If a clot is present, the angiogram reliably and accurately demonstrates its presence to the radiologist on the real-time X- ray . W it h this test, referred to a s the \"gold standard,\" one can confidently say whether or not the patient has an embolus. Angiography , ho wever , is technically challenging. It is dif ficult to find the artery with the catheter . It is costly , due to the time and equipment needed. It is dangerous, as the artery may tear during insertion of thecatheter . Another problem with angiography is that it requires injecting heavy metals into the artery and subjecting the patient to a lot of radiation. Consequently , medicine has loo ked for a surrogate test that can more easily and safely detect pulmonary emboli. The V/Q scan looks at the blood flow into and through the lungs and compares this with the air movement into and throug h the lungs. When all is well with the lungs, these two parameters match up. When an embolus is present, they usually don' t match up beca use blood flow is comp romised. This allows the diagnostician to surmise that even though they have not actually seen a clot, it is likely to be present. A surr ogate t est is o ne that does not look for what you need to find but rather for something likely to be there if the condition is p resent. The surrogate test allows doctors to make an educated guess. T o validate a surrogate test, one must first do a careful study in which the surr ogate test is compared to the gold standard test. This gives you exact information as to how accurate you can expect the surrogate testing to be. These validating studies are usually carried out at a lar ge medical center or a group of medical centers . The researchers begin by finding a lar ge number of patients\u2014say tw o thousand\u2014with symptoms typical of pulmonary emboli. For simplicity' s sake, let' s say that one thousand do have an embolus as demonstrated w ith an angiogram, the gold standard test, whereas the other one thousand do not. Now , we have a group of people who either have or don' t have the c ondition we are testing for . Then we do a V/Q scan on each of these two thousand patients. In the group that we know has an embolus, if nine hundred are positive o n the V/Q scan, then we know that the surrogate test picks up the diagn osis 90 percent of the time. In the other 10 percent, for whatever reason, t he surrogate test fails to dem onstrate the emboli even though we know it' s there. W e now know that the false negative rate is 10 percent. This allows the clinician to for go the more dif ficult angiogram because they know how likely the V/Q scan will be topick up the embolus if it is there. They also know that in the event that the test is negative they still have a 10 percent chance the test misse d it. In that case, the y may want to move to the angiogram if the level of suspicion is high that the pat ient does, in fac t, have an embolus in spite of the negative V/Q scan. This is basically the art of modern medicine. Likewise, the researchers can then take the one thousand people who test negative on the angiogram, do a V/Q scan on all of them, and determine the f alse positive rate. If one hun dred subjects test positive on the V/Q scan even though you know for sure they have no clot, then you can accurately and conf idently say that for whatever reason 10 percent of the ti me the V/Q scan is saying you have a clo t when you don' t. Again, this helps the clinician who may be confront ed with a patient whom he is pretty sure doesn' t have a clot (for example, they may have evidence of pneumonia or a heart attack) b ut orders a V/Q scan anyway . If the V/Q scan is positive they may want t o confirm this by moving on to an angiogram b ecause they know that in 10 percent of the cases the V/Q scan is falsely positive. Clearly the l ower the nu mber of false p ositives and false negatives, the better and more reliable is the test. The poin t is, without having a g old standard test with which to compare your sur rogate test, and without this comparison having been performed in the clearest and most meticulous way possible, there is no possibility of having an accurate surrogate test. T o be even clearer , without this comparison, the surrogate test is completely useless and misleading . . . completely\u2014yet of ficials are using surrogate Covid-19 tests to send people into nur sing homes, remove children from their families,13 and even separate newborn babies from their mothers if the mom tests positive!14 PCR tests, antibody tests, and every other test for a \"coronavirus\" are surrogate tests, which have ne ver been compared to any gol d standard; therefore, they are completely and utterly useless and misleading. They are propaganda, not science. The gold standard test for a vira l infection is the isolation, purification, and characteriza tion of the virus (as outlined in the description of Lanka' s experiment) and the proving of contagion. Lanka didn' t prove th at the virus he fo und was co ntagious simply because it isn' t, and no virus is contagious. This is the only possible gold standard there can be. The PCR test examines the pieces of genetic material taken from a swab from th e back of the sinus cavity (a very unpleasant proc edure). No research has shown that this genetic material is unique to that of coronavirus or even that it comes from a coronavirus. Taking a swab for a PCR test\u2014the procedure is invasive and unpleasant, and for some it is even painful. Furthermore, in order to examine this genetic material, the test \"amplifies\" it. An amplification cycle means they start with a probe that matches the snippet of DNA or RNA they are looking for . Then, because this is too small to detect, they r epeatedly double the snippets. If the sample changes the color of a solution, the test is considered positive. If you do too few amplification cycles, you never find the snippet, resulting in a false negative. If you do too many amplification cycles, you find the snippet too often because the test also amplifies the background genetic snippets (\"noise\"). These are false positives.One can therefore manipulate the amplification cycles to get whatever result one wants. T oo few cycl es and everyone tests negative; too many cycles and most test positive. John Ma gufuli, president of T anzania, may be the wisest world ruler alive to day . A chemist by trai ning, Magufuli submitted samples to the W orld H ealth O r ganization (W HO) for testing. Said Magufuli, \"W e took samples from goats; we sent sa mples from sheeps; we took samples from pawpaws; we sent samples from car oil; and we took samples from other dif ferent things; and we took the samples to the laboratory without them knowing.\" His of ficials named the sample of car oil Jabil Hamza, thirty years old, male. The results came back negative. They named a sample of jackfruit Sarah Samuel, age forty-five, female. The results came back inconclusive. Pawpaw got sent in as Elizabeth Ane, twenty-six years old, female. The poor pawpaw came back positive. Samples from a bird called kwar e and from a goat also tested positive; rabbit was indeterminate; sheep was negative.15 President Magufuli is not wasting any government money on te sting for hi s people, but in the W est, governments have spent millions for the PCR test kits. Since no PCR te st has ever unde r gone comparison to any gold s tandard, the results are meaningless. This is not a situation where we just need better or m ore accurate testing. As Kary Mullis, the inventor o f the PCR technology , has insisted, time and again, PCR tests do not prove causation and cannot diagnose illness.16 The CD C and the FDA concede that the PCR test cannot be used for diagnosis. A file from March 3 0, 2020, stated: \"Detection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms\" and \"This test cannot rule out diseases caused by other bacterial or viral pathogens.\"17 Furthermore, the FDA admits t hat \"positive results ... do not rule out bacterial infecti on or co-infection with other viruses. The age nt detected may not be the definite cause of disease.\"18 According to a product announcement for the LightMix\u00ae Modular SARS-CoV Assays, \"These assays are not intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of coronavirus infection.\"19 One can only wonder what ex actly the test is supposed to do if not diagnose a coronavirus infection? The same methodological prob lems are found with the new antibody tests for assessing immunity to \"coronavirus.\" Antibody testin g is another type of surrogate testing that doe s not diagnose illness or ascerta in its cause. A b rilliant paper by David Crowe20 exp lains in detail the fact that the theoretical unde rpinnings of antibody testing have not been demonstrated in any experiment. This is why the W ake Forest immunologist had to admit, \"we don' t know enough about immunology to make any conclusions.\" Scientists believe that antibodie s have a predictable and exact course as they track a viral infection. An tibodies are proteins made by o ur immune system to either fight of f a n illness or \"remember\" that we have encountered an infectious or ganism like a virus\u2014at least, this is what we've been told. The theory is that before we encounter a virus or get sick from a virus, w e have no antibodies to it. After getting sick, the PCR test should detect th e virus (or , more accurately , the genetic pieces we think could have come on ly from that virus). The n after one week (because viru ses and our immune system seem to understand the concept of one week), we begin to make an antibod y called IgM, w hich is not specific to this coronavirus but is made by our immune system to fight of f any virus. Then on day fourteen, as the virus is cl eared from your body , the PCR test goes back to negative, the I gM levels g o down, and w e see the appearance of the more tar geted IgG anti body . Then at day twen ty-one (because viruses understand that this happens in weekly intervals), the IgM is gone, the antibody test is reliably negative, and the IgG has pe aked. At day twenty-eight (because your immune system also understands weeks), the IgG level drops to a level it can sustain for the long term. Once the test manufacturer or virologist sees a stable Ig G level , they supposedly know you are immune for life from the ef fects of the virus . . . or maybe not. This theoretical and imaginary construct has many holes big enough that you could drive a truck thro ugh them. Consider the following: it turns out that a small percentage ac tually have IgM, IgG, or both antibodies months before having the \"infection.\" 21 How this is possible, since this is a novel virus that humans have never seen before, is not explained. Finally , studies show that IgG sometimes appears before and som etimes appears after IgM; sometimes th ere is no IgM; sometimes there is no IgG.22 In either case, it may mean you either had the virus or you didn' t. And as with AIDS, there is no proof that a particular level of I gG confers immunity . Ah, but virologists have an explanation for this: these new wily viruses somehow know how to escape detection and neutralization even if the person has a robust antibody response! That, of course, is nonsense. Then we 're told that a positive PCR test means you are either sick or not s ick, infectious or not infectious, and that sometimes the test is positive, then negative, then positive, then negative. It' s enough to make even the Mad Hatter go silent with disbelief! CHAPTER 6 E X O S O M E S After reading the last two chapters you may be shaking your head in disbelief; you may have so many questions swirling in your mind that you feel diso riented. The main question for us all is how the enti re world of medicine, virolo gy , and immunology , along with our political leaders, could have ma de such an obvious mist ake? How could generations of doctors and researchers have become convinced that many of our common diseases are viral in origin? Let' s first provide the scientific basis for challenging the notion of contagion . As we have said, an in-depth look at the scientific literature reveals no proof of the contagio n theory , but the alternate expl anations for so-called \"bacterial\" or \"viral\" illness do have research behind them. Only W estern medicine invokes the concept of contagion\u2014person-to-person transmission of harmful bacteria or viruses. Neither traditional Chinese medicine (TCM ) nor A yurveda (a system of medicine with his torical roots in the Indian subcontinent) en tertains the concept of contagion. These ancient h ealing s ystems look at imbalances, diet and toxins as the causes of disease. So how did the theory of viral causation come about? During the late 1800s, with the popularity of Pasteur and the increasing m aterialistic thinking of the age, the germ t heory gained popularity . The germ theoryexplained common observations, such as why drinking sewage water made people sick and why people who share a workspace or household seem to get sick in a sim ilar way at the same time. W ith the advent and widespread use of the light microscope, scientists and doctors could clearly identify bacteria associated with particular illnesses. In the nineteent h century , scientists and physicians assumed that the teeming forms they saw in th eir microscopes caused disease and were hostile t o life. In writing On the Origin of Species (published in 1859), Charles Darwin (a contemporary of Pasteur) proposed a theory of evolution in which only the plants and animals best adapted to their environment survive to reproduce. He paint ed a picture of life in which the various or ganisms were in constant struggle against each other . Darwin borrowed popular concepts (such as \"survival of the fittest\") from sociologist Herbert Spencer and \"struggle for existence\" from economist Thomas Malthus. The notion of hostility and competition in all of nature fit with attempts to justify th e socia l inequalities, poverty , and suf ferings that characterized the dawning Indust rial Age. Social Darwinism actually preceded biological Darwinism! For all the know n \"infectious\" bacterial illnesses, the science points to other ac curate e xplanations\u2014namely starvation and poisoning. However , the microscope gave scientists the ability to find germs at the site of disease. Their observations revolutionized the practice of medicine and our thinking. The microscope allow ed medicine to enter a \"scientific\" age and provide a ready and easy explan ation for illness\u2014one that circumvented the more dif ficult and less profitabl e work of cleaning up the cities, improving diets, mitigating poverty , and reducing pollution. However , bacter ia are found at the site of disease for the same reason that fire men are found at the site of fires. Bacteria are the cleanup crew tasked with digesting and getting rid of dead and diseased tissues. Claiming that bac teria cause a certain disease is no more reasonable than claimingthat fire men cause fires, especially as experimental evidence shows this to be false. Likewise, maggots on a dead dog are there to clean up dead tissue \u2014no on e would accuse the mag gots of killing the dog. In fact, one therapy for necro tic tissu e is maggot the rapy (applying maggots to the wound). The maggots kill only the dead tissu e; when there is only live tissue left to eat, they die of f. But scientists could not alway s find an of fending bacterium for a specific disease. Louis Pasteur could not find a bacterial agen t for rabies, and he speculated about a pathogen too small to be detected using a microscope.1 T he same held true for polio\u2014 hard as they tried, scientists could fi nd no bacteria at the s ite of the illness.2 Following Pasteur , and completely wedd ed to germ theory , they postulated a tiny enemy , something that our technology could not yet visualize. The search was on to find this disease-causing or ganism. The eu reka moment came with the invention of the electron microscope; scientists finally s aw tiny \"particles\" at the site of disease. These pa rticles had \"stuf f\" inside them, suggesting they were \"alive.\" They were more abundant in diseased tissue than in healthy tissue (although this is no t w hat Lan ka found in alga e). There were variations between types of particles, suggesting that one type of particle caused one disease and another particle type caused a dif ferent disease. Immediately assuming that these pa rticles were bad for us, scientists named them viruses , after the Latin word for \"toxin.\" Further research revealed that th ese particles often emer ged from within the cell; this led to the conclusion that these viruses were not just bad for the cell in which they resided, but they could invade other cells. Scientists surmised that viruses co-opted the \"machinery\" of the cell like parasites, turning t he cells into \"slaves,\" meaning the cell would do the bidding of its new master , the infecting parti cle. Like alien invaders in sci ence fiction movies, the particle would come from the outside, inject itself into the cell, take over the genetic machinery of the cell, reproduce itself by the thousands, and then emer ge from the cell to continue on its e volutionary path, spreading to take over the world. The wily virus theory was born\u2014except that what scientists had really discovered with their electron microscopes was not viruses but exosomes. The only thing infectious in this scenario was the noxious belief that these small particles, dubbed viruses, caused disease. This false the ory was the part that spread all over the world and is now threatening to kill us all. Exosomes are simple, well-characterized features in the cells of all creatures, and conventional scientists have carefully eluci dated their functions.3 When a living or ganism is th reatened in almost any way\u2014 through starvation, chemical poisoning, or electromagnetic ef fects\u2014the cells and tissues have a mecha nism for \"packaging,\" \"propagating\" and releasing these poisons. Modern researchers have shown that exosomes have exactly the same attribut es as \"viruses.\" They are the same size, contain the same components, and act on the same receptors.4 HIV res earcher James Hildreth, president and CEO of Meharry Medical College and former professor at Johns Hopkins, put it this way: \"The virus is fu lly an exosome in every sense of the word.\"5 Exo somes are completely indistinguishable from what the virologists been calling \"viruses.\" Here' s how exosomes work: let' s say you have a poorly nourished or ganism, then you expose it to a common environmental toxin. The tissues and cells that a re af fected begin to produce, package, and s ecrete these poisons in the form of exosomes. This is a way of ridding the cells and tissues o f substa nces that would do it great harm. The greater t he exposure to toxic assaults, the more exosomes will be produced. Exosomes leaving a cell. Studies have shown that if one somehow stops the cells from producing and excreting these exosomes, then the cells and tissues, in fact the or ganism, will have a worse out come.6 T his research d emonstrates tha t the production and excretion of exo somes is a crucial deto xification function of all cells and tissues. Another clearly demonstrated function of these exosomes is that they act as a kind of key that circulates in the blood and lymph of or ganisms, such as mamma ls and humans, until they find a distant cell with a lock into which this key fits.7 The exosome acts as a messenger , essentially warning the other cells and tissues that danger is afoot and that they need to prepare. Exosomes carry messages from one cell to another . Far f rom acting as hostile invadi ng viruses, exosomes provide a brilliant system of communication within an or ganism to rid the cells and tissues of poisons and then communicat e to the rest of the or ganism what has happened.8 F ar from acting as a source of illness, these particles are an integral part of our detoxification system. They are the true firemen, obviously present in higher amounts in cases of disease, in which a higher burden of poisoning has occurred. In fa ct, these \"viruses\" are not invaders but toxin-gobbling mes sengers that our cells pro duce to help us adjust to environmental assaults, including electro-smog.9 Aft er all, mos t people have a djusted to worldwide radio waves, e lectricity in our homes, and ubiquitous W i-Fi\u2014and the sparrow population rebounded after the Great Plague of 1738. It is exosomes that allow this to ha ppen. These tiny messengers provide real-tim e and rapid genetic adaptation to environmental changes. (Whether these exosomes can help us adapt to the extreme disruption of 5G is the question of the day .) If yo u d o an Internet search, you will find that exosomes are the latest thing in medicin e, used as a treatment for cancer , antiaging products, facial rejuvenation, hair regrowth, and even \"exosome penis treatment.\"10 Finally , the research shows that toxic exposure, including exposure to fear and stress, increases exosome production.1 1 T his should co me as no surprise to any honest observe r of sickness and health since many have noted that stressed, worried, fearful people get sick easier , so it makes sense that you would find increased detoxification \"products\" in their tissues. There is now clear experimental evidence that exosomes made by one or ganism can be picked up by other or ganisms (of the same or dif ferent species) and cause protective reactions in these new or ganisms.12 One study showed that if mice are exposed to the liver toxin known as acetaminophen (T ylenol), the liver cells increase their production of protective exosomes. The researchers isolated and purified these exosomes and exposed other mice to them. The second group of mice did not get sick, as would be predicted by the virus theory; instead they developed protective responses in their livers and secreted more exosomes.13 This is similar to what trees do when confronted with a beetle infestation. The originally af fec ted tree produces chemicals that help the tree surv ive the beetle exposure. These same chemicals are secreted, with the help of the fungus or mycelium in the soil, through the root system of the tree. These c hemicals then serve as messengers to the surrounding trees, telling them that beetles have taken hold and that protective measures may be n eeded. If the beetles go away , then these measures are not taken; if the beetles show up, the surrounding trees also produce a protective response. The real point he re is that thanks to exosomes, nature is not raw in tooth and claw but a superb cooperat ive venture. The originally af fected tree is not com peting f or survival with the other trees; the af fected tree needs the other tre es in order to survive an d thrive. W e need each other\u2014 members of our own species and other species\u2014otherwise none of us will survive. The ger m theor y is wrong; the virus theory is wrong. V iruses are not here to kill us; in reality they a re exosomes whose role is to provide the detoxification package and the communication system that allows us to live a full and healthy existence. A war on viruses is a war on life. It' s clear that the misidentification of exosomes as viruses was a tragic mistake, one that it' s about time we correct, once and for all. What we know about exosomes can help us solve the my stery of childhood diseas es like chicken pox and measles, and also of STDs, which seem to require an explanation of \"contagious.\" This will be the subject of the next chapter .CHAPTER 7 R E S O N A N C E Recently , on a forum for scientis ts, laypeople, and health-care professionals who que stion the safety and e f ficacy of vaccinations\u2014in other words a forum for people who question the practices of conventional medicine\u2014a professional sci entist made the following comment when one of the members pointe d out that Koch ' s postulates had never been me t for even a single v iral or bacterial disease . She said, \"No virologist of any note took any notice of Koch' s postulates ever .\" The comment says a lot about how virologists currently think, as Koch' s postulates are what anyone with common sense would use to prove that a microor ganism causes disease\u2014isolate the or ganism from a sic k animal or human and then introduce it into a healthy animal or human to see whether it ca uses disease. In a sane worl d, Koch' s postulates are not som ething one can \"discard.\" In the mid-twen tieth century , virologists apparently came to a fork in the r oad. W ith repeated failures to satisfy Koch' s or Rivers' postulates, it became obvious that viruses don' t cause disease. The scientists could either admit this and a ll become postmen, butchers, and greengrocer s\u2014in other words g et hones t jobs\u2014or they could proclaim that they changed the rules of logic, hope no one would notice, and possibly get fabulously wealthy and powerful from patents on antiviral medications and vaccines. It' s actuallyunderstandable t hat they took a flyer and chose the second route. T ragically , this farce worked, and the world became a much worse place for living beings to inhabit. The scientist quoted above later said: Polio alone revealed to them that out of ev ery thousand people infected, around ten would show signs of illness and one would become paralyzed. Even the old works on neisse ria [a type of bacteria said to cause meningitis and syphilis] from the old days, showed conclusively that the bacteria was carried extensively and routinely and that only around one in one hundred thousand would a ctually have clinical meningococcal d isease presentation. So to to ss in Koch' s postula te in order to dismiss an article is chasing an unrelated goose down another garden path. Suppose a professor theorizes that spraying a gentle stream of water (such as a shower) on people would kill them. T o test the theory , one hundred people are sprayed. No one is harmed. Most pe ople would conclude the theory was incorrect and spraying water on peo ple, in fact, doesn' t kill anyone. But some researchers would persist. They would test a thousand people , then fifty thou sand. . . . Finally , by chance, one subject dies. Of course, no honest or san e person would keep doing this experiment this long , but if it were done, the obvious question to ask would be whether something else happened to the person to kill him as it obviou sly couldn' t have bee n the water . Maybe he s lipped in the shower , hit his head, and died; or maybe he ha d an aneurysm in his brain, which due to a fight with his wife rig ht before being sprayed, happened to burst; or maybe he foolishly decided to spray the water into his airway to wash his dirty lu ngs. In any case, the cause of his demise is clearly not the spraying of water and the researchers would need to do a n individual investigation to find out what had really happened. For a prominent alternative leader not to understand the point of Koch' s postulates and write this in a public forum is cause for despair . One can only con clude that the depth of the delusion in the biological sciences is so deep tha t even scientists suppo sedly dedicating their lives to uncoveringone aspect of the delusion can ' t step out of the whole delusion and see things clearly . Another online statement by a prominent scientist goes even further: Koch' s postulate is completely wrong a nd irrelevant in our modern understanding of disease-causing agen ts. That is a set of principles developed in 1884! It was ten years before viruses were even discovered, and over sixty-five years before the immune system was d iscovered and of course one hund red fifteen years before the microbiome was understood. Most of the tenets of Koch' s postulates are wrong. Many , many well k nown infectious agents don' t fit it. If any doctor or scientist is out there using Koch' s postulate as \"proof\" that this Cov2 is not real, turn away because they have no idea they are talking about. Just like we moved away from the early 1600s geocentric model of the solar sy stem, we have to move away from Koch' s postulates. This is like saying that because Newton formulated the laws of gravity over three hundred years ago, they are now out of date and it' s safe to jump of f tall buildings! A re maining question is how to explain \"measles parties\" and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) like herpes. Investigating these phenomena leads to some interesting conclusions about the nature of life. T o u nderstand what seems to be the contagious nature of ch ildhood diseases like measles, mumps, and chicken pox, or STDs like herpes, gonorrhea, or syphilis, one must investigate the phenomena of r esonance . If one pluc ks a string tuned to a ce rtain frequency , the vibrations of the string will cause a seco nd string tuned to the same frequency to vibrate and sound at the same frequency . The two strings are not touching; the connection is through a sound wave that travels between the strings. When c onfronted with the question of \"what is a virus?\" one could easily ask that question about anything in nature. W e could say that a virus is made of che micals\u2014proteins, nucleic acids, minerals, lipid s, etc. But what are these chemicals made of? They are made of atoms, su ch as sulfur , oxygen, and carbon. Atoms are made of protons and neutrons in a nucleus and electrons circling around t he nucleus, sort of like the sun with theplanets circling around it. And as in the solar system, 99.999 percent of this atom is space; that is, it seems to be nothing. This presents an obvious dilemm a. How is it possible that this particle, which is made almost entirely o f nothing, creates an entity we call a virus, or a foot or a ch air , all of which seem solid? The only conclusion anyone of integrity can make is that we simply have no idea how this wor ks. T o make matters even worse, the top dogs of the science world, the physi cists, tell us that all this stuf f on earth can exist either as a space-filling par ticle or as a wave, w hich ha s no physical pr esence at all. In other words, both humans and viru ses are made of waves of ener gy that have no discerni ble physical presence. How a collection o f waves can write a book on viruses is anyone' s guess, but the fact that this occurs can' t be disputed. The only rational conclusion anyone can come to is that physical reality is a kind of ener gy or wave patte rn that crystallizes as physical reality under certain condition s. W e and every thing in the universe seem to participate in this dance of wave-particle manifestation. W ith this understanding, let' s turn to the results of a s eries of experiments carr ied out by a virologist named Luc Montagnier . Montagnier is cr edited with claiming to discover that the HIV virus causes AIDS. (He also claims that the Covid-19 \"virus\" is man-made.1) What he found can help us craft a realistic theory explaining the mystery of childho od illnesses like measles and STDs, which appear to be contagious (and also proves that even the misguided can sometimes redeem themselves). W e need to be cautious about applying his findings too broad ly . The vast majority of illness that seem s to be contagious is in reality just people exposed to similar toxins or suf fering from the same nutritional deficiencies. Hiroshima was no t contagious; Chernobyl spread throughout Europe, but it w as neither contagious nor caused by a virus. Sailors all getting sick on the same ship w ere not the victims of a virus; the likely explanation is that they all had a vitamin C deficiency called scurvy . Y oung people a t college exposed to hor rible food, severe psychological stress, and intense binge alcohol use are af fected by toxins, not some elusive virus. After sta rvation and toxicity are accounted for , we can admit that some diseases can be spread by a kind of ener getic resonance as predicted by a careful a nd accu rate study of the nature of physical stuf f, carried out by Luc Montagnier . Here' s how the experiment goes: first, one puts DNA or RNA in water (beaker one). Then one puts a co llection of nucleic acids (the ch emicals that make up the DN A and RNA) i n a separate water beaker (beaker two), in another part of the room. Then one introduces an ener gy source, such as UV or in frared light and shines that on beaker one, which contains the formed DNA or RNA. In time, the exact same sequence of DNA or RN A will form out of the raw materials in beaker two. There is no possibility of physic al connection between the two beakers. The only conclusion one can draw from this simple experiment is that the DNA or RNA i n the first beake r has a resonance ener gy picked up by the second beaker . This resonance ener gy then becomes the bluep rint for the formation of the identical piece of DNA or RNA in the second beaker .2 This revolutionary experiment is clear and simple\u2014and repeatable. This formation of DNA or RNA in the second beaker can happen only if both beakers have water in them. W ithout water , no resonance is possible. Even in our string example, it is the water vapor in the air that is resonating. When one applies this discovery to viruses (or exosomes) said to cause measles, chicke n pox, or herpes, it is possible that since these particles called vi ruses or exosomes are s imply packages of DNA or RNA , they emit their own resonant frequencie s. In a way not yet determined, each frequency creates an expressio n that we call a disease; however , the frequency will create what we call illness only if there is a p urpose or reason for the illness. Chicken pox is a universal way for children to live a long life. C hildren who exp erience chicken pox have less disease (and especially less cancer) than do children who haven' t had chicken pox. The same holds for measles, mumps, and most childhood \"infectious\" diseases.3 Why do measles and chicken pox seem to be infectious? One child puts out the message through exoso mes that now is time to go through the detoxifying experience called ch icken pox. Other children in their home or class or town receive the message and begin the same detoxification experience. In the end, the children are all better of f for hav ing \"sung\" together . W ith an illness like herpes, resonance may also be at play . (Also, a collagen deficiency may contrib ute to the genital irritations in patients with herpes and other STDs.) So when two pe ople come together in the highly char ged act of sex, a situation in which this resonance acts strongly , it is no surprise that the couple might resonate together and create identical DNA or RNA, in a manner similar to what occurred in the beaker . T o a virologist, this looks like the appearance of a new co ntagious virus. T o a realistic observer , it is two peo ple for ging an intimate genetic connection. This observation, rather than proving contagion, teaches us about the mystery we call life . It teaches us again that the materialistic conception of the \"wily attack virus\" is an impoverished, i naccurate view of the world. And it teaches us to for go simplistic explan ations and look into the deepest mysteries of life if we are to create a world of health and freedom. The discoveries about the resonant properties of genetic material can also help us explain how humans and animals adjust to new situations\u2014a new toxin or new electromagnetic frequencies\u2014not by competition and survival of the fittest but through the harmonizing of shared experience. Imagine a situation where the h uman community is confronted with a new toxin. The new toxin can be neutralized only by an enzyme that is not usually made by human beings . But one member of the community has a randomly genera ted mutation that allows her\u2014and only her\u2014 to make the toxin-neutralizing enzyme. She does well, whereas others sicken and some die because this randomly ge nerated mutation gives her an adaptive advantage. Acc ording to the theory of genetic mutation and natural selection, her genes will slowly spread throughout the populatio n. But what if she is a sixty -year -old postm enopausal woman, or a man w ho does not have children? Then the helpful gene would die out. If we're lucky , the carrier of the gene will be a th irty-year -old man about to get married. He and his wife have six children with three carrying the autosom al dominant mutation. One of those three di es in a car crash, the other beco mes sterile following a Gardasil vaccine, a nd the third passes the adaptive gene on to her t wo children. In ten thousand years, that adaptive gene will have spread throughout the population through natural selection. Unfortunately , the toxin eit her has killed everyone of f by then or is long gone, so t he mutation is us eless. It' s clear that the theory of natural selection follow ing random mutations cannot explain how humans and animals adapt to new situations in time for these mutations to be useful. So how do we adapt? Our threatened cells produce exosomes containing DNA and RNA, which have a unique resonance. The pattern of this genetic material will quickly pass to others through resonance (especially if they are in cl ose contact). This is the rol e of \"viruses\" in nature; they are physical- resonance forms of genetic material that code for changes happ ening in the environment. They provide real-time genetic adaption. It' s a totally ingenious system that we have missed by assuming that viruses are hostile and dang erous. A war on viruse s is nothing more than a war on the forward evolution of humanity .PART 2 WHAT CAUSES DISEASE?CHAPTER 8 W A T E R If th e practice o f medicine were conceived properly in the W e stern world, doctors would begin by ascerta ining four basic factors: the qu ality of the water th eir patie nts drink; the quality of the food they eat; the level and type of t oxins, including mental a nd emotional toxins, to which they are exposed; and finally the level and type of electromagnetic fiel ds to which they are subjected. The vast majority of medical problems can be understood by gathering patien t information on these four areas, and the vast ma jority of health problems can be helped or even solved, by \"remediating\" these four core issues. W ater , especially the water that supports life inside our cells and tissues, has ama zing properties. W e are accustomed to think of water existing in only three states: solid, liquid, or gas. However , water\u2014and only water\u2014 also has a fourth state, sometimes called coherent water , structur ed water , or si mply the ge l phase. Each p hase of water has unique chara cteristics in terms of bond angles (the an gles between the hydrogen and oxygen molecules), char ge, motion c haracteristics, and many oth er physical properties. Dr . Gerald Pollack, author of the groundbreaking book Cells, Gels and the E ngines of L ife,1 along with biologist Dr . Gilbert Ling, were the first to describe the fourth stage of w ater and delineate its properties. Pollack coined the term EZ (exclusio n zone) water . Fourth-phase water will structure itself against a hydrophilic (\"water -loving\") surface. Instead of moving random ly , the water molecules line up and form a crystalline structure that can be millions of molecules deep; this structure excludes every m ineral an d every other ty pe of molecule or chemical fro m its midst. The wat er outside the EZ is \"bulk\" water , which contains minerals and dissolved compounds. It is basically \"disordered,\" whereas EZ water is \"ordered.\" W ate r is called the \"universal solvent\" because any hydrophilic substance will dissolve in it. E Z water is a pure crystalline \"structure\" consisting solely of hydrogen and oxygen. EZ water is nei ther liquid nor solid, but rather is similar to a gel. T o picture t his fourth phase of wa ter , imagine Jell-O (a coherent, non-solid, nonliquid, nongaseous mixture of unfolded proteins and water). The embedded water is arranged in clusters of molecules that or ganize themselves into a regular (\"coherent\") structure that we see as a gel. Jell-O is 99 percent water , yet water does not come out of Jell-O if it stays at the right temperatur e. Our bodies a re 45-75 percent water , yet w hen we cut ourselves, wate r does not flow out because the water in our bodies is \"structured\" against the various hydrophilic surfaces in our tissues. EZ wate r has a negative char ge. In contrast, bulk water has a positive char ge, making the water in our cells a kind of battery . The ener gy that char ges the battery is heat an d light ener gy ranging from the infrared through visible light through UV . This is why we feel better wh en we are in the s unlight, especially in the e arly morning or evening, which contains a lot o f infrared light. This is why saunas (and heat in general) m ake us feel better . H eat and light help you r intercellular and extracellular water form lar ger EZs. Fever does the same thing, which is why we should not suppress a fever . W ater from melting glaciers and from deep wells and springs are good sources of structured water bec ause EZ water is created und er pressure.Holy wa ters fro m the river Gan ges and from Lourdes, with known healing properties, contain high amounts of structured EZ water .2 Recent studies have revealed that relaxed muscles contain mostly EZ water , whereas contracted muscles transition to mainly bulk water .3 Anesthetics and drugs that reduce pain reduce the size of the E Z zones in our cells. EZ wate r is the perfect \"structure\" for life processes because this fourth phase water gel can be shaped by the proteins, minerals, nu cleic acids, lipids, a nd other substances in o ur body to form any shape or co nfiguration of gel. This gel has an infinite number of binding sites, which allow it to change in response to a new stimulus. This stimulus can be in the form of chemicals such as hormones, e ner gies such as thoughts and feelings, or even the resonant ener gies of th e earth, sun, and stars. The shape of this gel unfolds the nucleic acids embedded in it, thereby controlling the expression of the genetic material. The structured EZ water in our cells, sometimes only a few molecules deep, is li ke a fine mesh of wires that ca rries ener gy and information. Against a hydrophilic surface (left), EZ water excludes all minerals and has a negative charge. Bulk water contains minerals and other compounds and has a positive charge. (Illustration from The Fourth Phase of W ater, Ebner and Sons. Reprinted with permission.) EZ water has a crystalline structure made up of layers of six-sided rings, slightly displaced. In ice, the layers of six-sided rings are not displaced. (Illustration from The Fourth Phase of W ater, Ebner and Sons. Reprinted with permission.) T oxins a nd EMFs damage the gel in our cells, interfering with v irtually every ph ysiological process. Th is damaging of the gels is a hu ge factor in disease; in essence, it is the unified field principle behind health and illness. Consider the lens of the eye, one of the purest examples of a structured water gel in the body . The lens of the eye is a crystalline water structure, or ganized\u2014as a re all tissues\u2014by a unique composition of prot eins, lipids, minerals, nucleic acids, and other components. These componen ts form the casing or housing for the crysta lline water that forms the bulk of the lens. The lens must be transparent to light, and this requirement determines how the wat er is or ganized. When all is well, the lens is a soft, flexible, transparent gel. If we disturb the crystalline nature of the gel with things such as toxins o r electromagnetic field exposure, the gel becomes distorted, unable to maintain its characte ristic transparency . This is what we call a cataract. If we are able to detoxify the gel, the lens can heal. Un fortunately , eye doc tors kno w nothing of this dynamic so they resort to some sort ofsur gical interven tion to replace the diseased lens. This is not h ealing, it is mechanical inte rvention, a temporary fix that can never resolve the underlying cause. Consider the characteristic joint disease called osteoarthritis. In the healthy situatio n, the joints ar e surrounded by negatively char ged gels called b ursa. These gels not on ly physically protect the underlying bones (themselves a denser type of gel), but, because they are negatively char ged, when tw o opposing bursa come together the negative char ges repel each other , thus ensuring smooth movement. When the gels are sick and not forming properly , we lack the protection for the underlying bones. The negative repulsion is lacking, and movement is painful. If noth ing is done the bones begin to erode against each other , a process we call osteoarthritis. Again, a s conventional medicine knows nothing of the underlying dynamic at pl ay , the only treatments are pain medicine or joint replacement, both of which often have major negative ef fects for the patient. A fi nal example involves the w hole area of inflammation and fevers. Our cell s and tissues are meant to contain perfect crystalline gels. If a toxin becomes dissolved into the gels, the body attempts to rid itself o f this toxin. The way the body does this is to elevate the temperature (we call this a fever), w hich pa rtially liquifies the gels so that the toxins can be flushed out in mucu s, after which we feel better , meaning we reconstitute our perfect gels onc e again. Fever and infla mmation is simply a detoxification process, not a disease that needs to be suppressed. Until doctors understand these s imple principles, we must suf fer under a medical system that cannot heal . That is one of the biggest trag edies of our time. Jell-O is fractal i n natur e\u2014meaning that any sm all piece of the gel has the same molecular shape as th e lar ger gel. Examination of the smallest molecular units of the gel reveals it to be the same form as the macroscopic unit. Th is featur e allows information to pass via all levels and to connectthe molecular level to the macro scopic level. Here, we can only hint at the crucial importance of the coherent nature of water as the basis of life. Preliminary findings indicate that when structured water is exposed to a W i-Fi signal from a nearby rou ter , the size of the EZ diminishes by about 15 percent.4 T his finding ha s profound implications for the interaction of EMFs a nd the structure of wa ter in our cellular gels. If a nearby W i-Fi router causes such a change, w e can only imagine what the millimeter waves of 5G do to the structured water in our tissues. Since hu man be ings are made up of 70 percent water by volu me and over 99. 99 perce nt of the molec ules in a human being are water molecules, we need to pay attention to the quality of the water we drink. Health professionals' f oremost concern should be the type of water and other liquids their patients are consuming. W ater consume d by healthy nonindustrialized peoples ha d four characteristics: First, the water was free of toxins. This is in complete contrast with the municipal wa ter that most people drink. T o day' s water contains chlorine and chloramine, which are toxic to our microbiome, as well as to the res t of our body . T oday' s water contains fluoride, an industrial waste that is tox ic to the enzymes in our tissues, enzymes needed for every chemical transfo rmation that happens in our bodies. W ater also contains microplastics, which can line and congest the intestinal wall, and aluminum, which p redisposes us to electrical sensitivity as well as a laundry list of diseases. Municipal water contains residues of many pharmaceutical drugs, including birth control pills, statins, and antidepressants. Second, traditionally consumed water was abundant in vital minerals such as magnesium, calcium, zinc, and iodine. Third, all traditionally consume d water was at least partially structured and or ganized into EZs because in nature, water moves in vortex patterns. W ater b ubbles u p from the gro und in springs, swirls in pools, flows over rocks, and forms eddies and v ortices. W ater flowing in vortex patterns becomes more \"coherent,\" beco ming increasingly structured. T he structure actually persists for some time, and does not revert to incoherent bulk water just because it stops flowing. W ater f lowing in vortices also picks up oxygen from the air and becomes more oxygenated. In contrast, most municipal water is stagnant in tanks and then flows through linear pipes with no vortex movement possible. This water is devoi d of structure and coherence, and also completely devoid of oxygen; this lack of oxygen has a deleterious ef fect on our microbiome. Finally , tradition ally consumed water was exposed to the sou nds and wavelengths of the natural world. W ater flowing in mountain streams is exposed not just to the minerals, microbes, and other constitu ents of the forest, b ut also the sounds and ener gies of the life of the fores t and of the entire natural universe, including the stars, sun, and moon. It' s clea r that most water is sick and toxic and a major contributor to illness. If we are ever to change the course of the disease patterns in our world, i t must start with clean, healthy water . Clean, healthy water should be completely free of any toxins: no chlorine, no fluoride, no aluminum, no lead, no pharmaceutical residues, no microplastics\u2014nothing should be present that is not a natural c omponent of water flowing in a healthy mountain stream. Currently the only way this is possible is to purify the water dow n to the nanoparticle lev el. This is a monumental task but one t hat can be accomplished with the proper equipment. It is truly unfortunate, even tragic, that our water must be cleaned a nd \"purified\" in order for us to consume it, but until the w orld wakes up to the fact that poisoning the water is a completely unacceptable practice, we'll have to take these precautions. Whole-house wa ter purifiers do exist that can filter the water a nd then add minerals while oxygenating and structuring the water by letting it flowin a vortex pattern. There are a lso less expensive ways of cre ating clean, structured, well-oxygenated water (see Appendix A). Drinking well-o xygenated water is important. In addition to their highly structured qualit y , the two most sacred and medicinal waters in the world, the wate r of the grotto at Lourde s (coming from a very deep spring) and the water in the Ganges river (coming from glaciers in the Himalayas), are likely highly oxygenated.5 High oxygen levels help explain why the waters of Lourdes and the Ganges have been associated with healing of a variety of diseases. Oxygen is essential and foundational for a healthy life; increasing the oxygen levels in ou r tissues im proves the function and in particular the ener gy -generating capacity of our t issues. Oxygen deficiency has been widely associated with the deve lopment of cancer through the well-known W arbur g ef fect; that is, the switch from aerobic to anaerobic fermentation processes in our cells. Hypoxia, the condition of low oxygen levels in the tissues, is a typical symptom of Covid-19. Conventional re searchers often claim that we can get oxygen into our bodies o nly though our lungs, so how do the oxygen levels i n our water af fect our health? Like so many other \"truths\" in science, the idea that we only absorb oxygen through our lungs is incorrect. If one uses sensitive oxygen measurement devices, one can demonstrate that soaking in a tub of highly oxygenated water and drinking highly oxygenated water will cause the oxygen level in the blood to rise.6 Thi s pro ves that at least some o xygen is absorbed both through the skin and the GI tract. Highly oxygenated water contributes to our health in another important way , as shown in a study of plant growth. Research has shown th at watering plants with highly oxygenated w ater stimulates their growth and improves their hea lth and resistance to di sease.7 For many scientists, this makes no sense because we are told that plants don' t use oxygen but rather they breathe out oxygen. How is it p ossible that exposing plants to oxygenated water increases their health and vitality? The answer is c learly that the o xygen doesn' t af fect the plants directly but that the oxyg en is used by the microbes in the soil. W atering plants with oxygenated wat er stimulates the growth of healthy aerobic bacteria in the soil. Pla nts don' t primarily eat o r absorb nutrients from the soil; rather , they (like us) eat the \"waste products\" of the bacteria in the soil. If we feed the microbes in the soil healthy nutrients including oxygen, the healthiest microbes will flourish. These put out the healthiest nutrients, which are absorbed by the plants to create healthy , flourishing plants. So i t is with us. W e don' t actual ly absorb the nutrients directly f rom our food, at least not solely . Rather , we eat food and drink water to nourish the billions of microbes in our gut. If we increase the oxygen level in the water we d rink, we gr ow healthy aerobic bacteria in our GI tract. Th ese aerobes use the water a nd the food w e consume to make the high est- quality nutrients for us to absorb. A nd with plenty of oxygen, these healthy microbes will not switch to an anaerobic metabolism that produces toxins. Life is a complex dance o f nature, microbes, and or ganisms. Oxygenated water produces the conditions in which the healthiest microbes flourish and produce robust, vibrant, disease-resistant people, plants, and animals. Microor ganisms that don' t have enough oxygen become anaerobic and produce toxins that cause d iseases like botulism, tetanus, cholera, and typhus. Recent research indicates that drinking oxygenated water im proves wound healing,8 enhances lactic acid clearance in athletes,9 improves immune status,10 a nd protects ag ainst muscle fatigue.1 1 Oxygenated water is a muc h better choice for athle tes than steroids! In addition, c onditions of low oxygen promote cancer growth.12 Currently most people consume devitalized food and oxygen-d eficient water; antibioti c use is rampant and most people therefore have a predominance of toxic, disease-causing anaerobic bacteria in th eir GI tract. And, after all this we blame our illnesses on a virus that we can' t even find! The fina l step in the production of healthy water is the exposu re, as in nature, of the water to the sounds and ener gies of nature. T his can be accomplished through the exposure of the finished water to birds, frogs, trees, and other living things, or even through exposing wate r to sacred sounds, to music, to healing vib rations, to a blessing\u2014or even to healthy , loving v ibrations in the household. This crucial finishing step recreates the process through which nature \"produces\" water fit for consumption. All animals will naturally seek out such water . All animals when allowed free choice w ill eschew the toxic, dead, industrial water consumed by the vast majority of the people in the world. As w e will see in chapter 8 , fermented beverages like kombucha and kefir ach ieve a kind of structur e through the fermentation process and an ef fervescence th at structures water around each bubble of air . Gelatinous bone broth carries the structur e of collagen, which helps cre ate healthy collagen throughout the body , down to the smallest structures in our cells\u2014 water structures itself against the hydrophilic surfaces of this collagen. The water we get in fruits and vegetables is also structured. W ell-oxygenated water for drinking and bathing should be the first thing pa tients receive when they enter a hospital or nursing home. Until then, see Appendix A for source s of healthy options, which are the best we can do as we go about the long and tedious process of reclaiming our world. CHAPTER 9 F O O D In the late 1890s, as the germ theory gained prominence, a new invention came on the scene: the stainless-steel r oller pr ess . This gleaming contraption allowed manufacturers to extract oil from hard see ds like corn kernels, cottonseeds, and soybea ns. Primitive stone presses worked only for oily see ds like sesame, flax, and rapeseed and for oily fruits like olives, coconuts, and palm fruit. A traditional stone press extracts the oil slowly and without heat, so the final product is natural and tends to be healthy . Oil from cottonseed\u2014a waste product of the cotton industry\u2014was the first fabrication of the new mechanized press. Like all industri al seed oils, cottonseed oil oozes out of the crushed seed as a dark, smelly gunk, something no one in his right mind would consume. High-temperature processing, whic h involves alkaline chemicals, deodorizing, bleaching, and hydrogenation ( a process that tu rns a liquid oil into a solid) tra nsforms the dark gunk into a product suitable for its initial use: candles. Proctor & Gamble, located in Cincinnati, perfected the refining process for this industrial product. But with electrification, the candle industry declined. What were they going to do wit h the expensive processing infrastructure in which they had invested? Feed the oil to people, of course. The result was a profound cha nge in the food supply , someth ing the world ha d never seen. It took about forty years for industrial seed oils\u2014asboth hard, partially hydrogenate d fats and as liquid cooking oils\u2014to replace animal fats for cooking and baking; cheap industrial oils from cottonseed, corn, and soybeans made the processed-food industry possible\u2014so cheap and so profitab le that the industry had plenty of money for marketing campaigns and plenty of clout to influence university research and government policy . For years, health or ganizations including the W orld Health Or ganiz ation (WHO) have recommended a diet containing industrially processed vegetable oils instead of natural animal fats. No dietary change has ever been as deleterious to health as the advent of indu strial seed oils, usually called \"vegetable oils\"; loaded with chemicals, intrinsically rancid, a nd lacking the many essential nutrients that humankind gets exclusively from animal fats like butter , lard, poultry fat, and tallow , they are a recipe for poor health. Chronic disease s uch as heart disease and cancer , kidney problems, Alzheimer ' s, and immune disorders have inc reased in lockstep with the increase in vegetable oil consumption. Moreover , the type of fat molecu les in vegetable oil (omega-6 li noleic acid) can mak e our bodies more se nsitive to the ef fects of elec tromagnetic radiation. W e have trillion s of cells in our bodies, and every cell is surrounded by a me mbrane composed of a double layer of fat molecules, called the lipid bilayer . Th ese molecules are mostly saturated b ecause , after all, they are animal fats. The other main com ponent of the cell membrane is cholester ol . T ogether , the saturated fats and cholesterol ensure that the cell membrane is waterproof, thus allowing a discrete chemistry and a dif ferent electrical potential inside and outside the cell. The remarkable m embrane is engineered with channels and receptors so that only certain compounds get in and out. Embedded in the cell' s interior are the mitochondria, which help create ener gy . T hey are like tiny electric motors inside our cells. These too have a membrane comp osed of a doub le layer of fat molecules, mo st of whichshould be saturated, in order for the mitochondria to support ef ficient ener gy generation for our cells and bodies. As we explained in chapter 8 , the structures in your tissues serve to create microscopic enclosures where water structures itself against billions of hydro philic surfaces. The areas of structured water have a negative char ge. Inside the cell, structured water fills the spaces, creating what amounts to a web of fine wires to carry electric current through the cell and on to other cell s. Good health depends on keeping this gell ed structure protected and intact\u2014protected from poisons, EMFs, and even negative emotions. The goal is to keep o ur own internal currents as saf eguarded as possible against interference from 5G and other outside EMFs. Saturated fats serv e as a k ind of insulation in cells and tissues. On the oth er hand, the types of fat molecules in vegetable oils\u2014called polyunsaturated fatty acids \u2014do no t provid e the stability th ese structures need. When built into our cell and tissue membranes, the cells become \"floppy\" and \"leaky\"; they can no longer provide ef fective barriers that our cells require to function properly . Having adequate saturated fat in our cell membranes is es pecially important in the Internet age b ecause 5G and other EMFs increase the permeability of the cell membrane,1 which can result in a kind of starvation of all our tissues , with all sorts of unfortunate consequences\u2014f rom fatigue to cancer . At least half the fat molecules in the cell membrane need to be saturated in order for our cells to function optimally . The fat molecule in our lung surfactants need s to be 100 percent saturated for the lung s to work properly .2 If our diet is lacking in sa turated fat, the body will put polyunsaturated or partially hydrogenated fatty acids in the lung surfactants, making respira tion dif ficult, with lung disease such as asthma and pneumonia likely consequences.3 Chronic lower respiratory disease includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, and bronchitis. The lungs simply can not work properly in those who consume a lot of industrial seed oils. Saturated animal fats also supply cholesterol, which is needed in the cell membranes to ensure the cells are waterproof so they can have a dif ferent electric potential on the inside and outside of the cell. Another important compound we get uniquely from animal fats is arachidonic acid, which is required for tight cell-to-cell junctures. A ke y function of saturated anim al fats is to serve as carriers f or a trio of fa t-soluble nutrients: vitamins A, D, and K2. The levels of these vitamins were much higher in the diets of our ancestors and of nonin dustrialized peoples, for three reasons. Fi rst, most of the fats that our ancestors consumed were animal fats\u2014b utter , lard, poultry fat, and tallow . Second, they ate the whole animal\u2014not just the muscle meats but also the or gans, marrow , skin, and blood. The fa t-soluble vitamins are concentrated in these or gan meats, especially the liver . Even as late as W orld W ar II, Americans typically ate liver once a week, giving them a consistent dose of vitamin A. Third, animals were raised on pasture in the sunlight, which serves to maximize the amounts of these key nutrients in our food. Egg yolk from a chicken raised outside, the old-fashioned way , contains several times more vitamin D than does an egg yolk from a chicken raised in confinement\u2014the \"modern\" industrial model.4 Nothing can happen in the body without vitamins A, D, and K2 \u2014 from growth to hormone formation, to ener gy production, to reproduction\u2014this triumvirate of nutrients works together to protect us against toxins and enhance immun ity . V itamin A is particularly important for healthy lung function.5 The best sourc es are cod liver oil, or gan meats from healthy animals (think liver , liverwurst, scrapple, p\u00e2t\u00e9, and terrines), egg yolks from pastured hens, butter and cream from grass-fed cows, fish egg s, shellfish, oily fish, lard from pigs raised outdoors, and poultry fat and poultry liver from birds raised in the sunlight on green grass\u2014all food items that conventional public health of f icials discourage us from eating or that modern industrial agricultural practices make it dif ficult to obtain. Modern eating practices rob us not only of these nutrients but of minerals as well, because the fat-soluble vitamins play a key role in mineral assimilation. Smoothies made from or ganic vegetables contain minerals, but these lar gely go to waste without the fat-soluble vitamins. Industrial seed oil production fi lls our bellies but starves our cells; the same ca n be said for industrial grain production. A triumph of industrial processing is the Chorleywood method, whereby grains of w heat can be transformed into loaves of bread in their plastic bags in two hou rs; also the high-temperature, high-pressure extrusion process, which produces dry breakfast cereals like Cheerios and Wheaties out of wheat, oats, and corn. T raditional, nonindustrialized cultures from around the world did not eat grains in t his way; instead, they subjected them to a long, slow fermentation pro cess, such as soaking oats overnight or even for several nights before cooking them into a sour porridge.6 Naturally leavened sourdough bread is a fermentation process that takes several days. In Africa, parts of the Middle East, and als o in medieval Europe, slow ferm entation of grains w as the first step in creat ing nourishing beverages like sor ghum beer and small beer\u2014beverages of low alcohol content and hig h levels of nutrients, especially B vitamins. Small beer was a common beverage, even for children, in colonial times\u2014Benjamin Franklin consumed it for breakfast, and Geor ge W ashington had a recipe for small beer involving bran and molasses.7 Such a beverage would have nourished the gut flora by providing structured water around the fizzy bubbles and B vitamins galore. Grains that haven' t been soaked, sprouted, or fermented are dif ficult for humans to digest and contain many \"anti-nutrients,\" compounds like phytic acid, lectins, and enzyme inhib itors, which block digestion and can even lead to mineral deficiencies. Modern grain products\u2014including trendy \"health\" products like oat bran muf fins and granola\u2014fill the belly but do not nour ish. Sometimes they even poison. The extrusion process used to make breakfast cereals creates neurotoxins;8 gl uten in wheat becomes toxic without proper preparation. Careful preparation transforms grains into real food\u2014incre asing B vitamins and liberating minerals for easy assimilation. The food industry \"solves\" the problem of modern grain processing by adding synthetic vitamins. In any event, overt de ficiencies are rare in America, not because of the synthetic vitamins added to grains, but because most Americans eat plenty of meat. An inter esting s ymptom in some Covid-19 patients is \"Covid toes\"\u2014 red, infl amed to es, similar to p ellagra toes (which is caused by a niacin deficiency). Pellegra T oes (L); Covid T oes (R) Scientists have observed a thr eefold depletion of NAD (a form of niacin) in the cells of Covi d patients, a condition blamed on the coronavirus. However , exposure to wireless technology and microwave radiation can also deplete cellul ar forms of niacin.9 The obvious defense is to li mit EMF ex posure and consume ample B vitamins, especially niacin. Proper preparation of grains and suf ficient animal products will ensure adequate levels of the B vitamins. Other obvious products of the Industrial Revolution are refine d white flour and sugar (and its mod ern evil twin, high-fructose corn syrup [HFCS]). Refined sweeteners and white flour are the quintessential \"displacing foods of modern commerce.\" Ironically , these refined foods actually play an important role in the diets of those avoiding animal fats. The bod y has such a great need for saturated fat to maintain the membranes and surfaces in the tissues that it has a backup plan in case our diets do not contain adequate amounts: it makes saturated fat from carbohydrates, especially refined carbohydrates.10 Unfortunately , this backup plan will not provide the fat-soluble nutrients we get from animal fats nor the B vitamins in their natural forms that we get from properly prepared whole grains. Instead, consumption of refined carbs serves as a fast track to the chronic diseases from which W esterners suf fer\u2014diabetes, heart dise ase, kidney problems, high blood pressure, and cancer . The vast majority of Covid-19 victims suf fer from one or more of these preexisting conditions. Diets ba sed on vegetable oils or even on olive oil often lead to c ravings for refined carbohydrates; a return to animal fats is the first step to resolving the need for refined carbs. The embrace of \"plant based\" diets (whether vegan, vegetarian, or just low in animal products) is another trend that contributes to nutritional starvation. Although some people report improved health when they embark on a \"p lant based\" diet, deficiencies will develop ove r time. The decision to avoid animal products often comes with resolutions to \"eat better\" in general and avoid proc essed food. Removing sources of vegetable oils, wh ite flour , and refined sweeteners from the diet is only part of the process for regaining good health; the other part requires the consumption of n utrient-dens e food. Although plant foods have a definite role to play in human diets, they are far less dense in vitamins and minerals than are animal foods. Long-term vegetarianism, especially veganism, often results in deficiencies of complete protei n; the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and K2; vitamin B12; and four key minerals: zinc, sulfur , iron, and calcium. On the other hand, plant foods like beans, nuts, and grains tend to be high in copper , and a hi gh copper -to-zinc ratio can dispose one to elec tromagnetic sensitivity .1 1 L ack of iron, of course, leads to anemia and fatigue; sulfur supports mecha nisms for oxygen transport in the blood. Both zinc and sulfur su pplementation seem to help Covid-19 patients. Best sources are animal foods like red meat, liver , and egg yolks. V itamin A from animal fats and liver helps ensure that i ron goes into the red blood cells where it is needed and that all minerals are used ef fectively . The body has a harder time usi ng iron added to processed foods, like breakfast cereals and white flour , so it ends up in the soft tissues where it does not belong\u2014so-called toxic iron\u2014rather than in the bloodstream where the iron in red blood cells carries oxygen to the tissues. Covid-19 and zinc deficiency have many symptoms in common: cough, nausea, fever , pain, abdominal cramping, diarrhea, loss of taste and smell, loss of appetite, fatigue and apathy , inflammation, and decreased immunity . Zinc-rich foods and even zinc l ozenges provide real protection against this disease. One ef fect of 5G seems to be the stimulation of calcium channe ls in the cell membrane. This drives calcium into cells, essentially poisoning the cell, while lowering the ionizable ca lcium in the blood. The ionized calcium in the blood is used in the coagulation pathways to help clotting and prevent uncontrolled bleeding. If it drops too low , people hemorrhage. During the 1918 p andemic, many docto rs noted that their patients died from hemorrhage, not pneumonia. Some doctors reported that IV calcium lactate kept peo ple from dying. Soon after , Royal Lee from the Standard Process company formulated a flu product called Congaplex, which contained calcium lactate\u2014 the same form of readily available calcium as in raw milk. In a ddition, raw whole milk fro m pastured cows contains compounds that strengthen the immune system and help us deal with stress and EMFs.12 The grea test trag edy of the germ theory has been its application to milk, nature' s perfect food. T oday , most milk is subject to pasteurizat ion; in fact, most milk is ultra-pasteurized, a process that flash heats milk to 230 degrees Fahrenheit, way above boiling point, ostensibly to rid milk of harmful germs, but actually to lengthen shelf life. Unfortunately , pasteurization greatly lowers the vitamin content\u2014one dairy industry study found that pasteurization resulted in lower amounts of all the B vitamins, especially B2, B6, and B12\u2014and these were studies of milk that was merely pasteurized, tha t is, heated t o 170 degrees.13 It' s likely that ultra- pasteurization results in the destruction of up to 100 percent of the vitamins in m ilk. The m inerals will remain, but the enzymes the body needs to assimilate these minerals are destroyed. Pasteurization des troys beta- lactoglobulin, which is needed for the intestinal uptake of vita mins A and D.14 Pasteurization in the name of the germ theory has resulted in the destruction of most of the goodness in milk, a prime food for growing children in W estern culture. Pasteurization also renders milk proteins aller genic; many people with milk aller gies turn to \"milk\" made of almonds, peas, oats, or soy , which have dubious nutritional value. Raw , whole milk (especially from grass-fed animals) is a complete, easily digested food. It contains every nutrient that babies and ch ildren need for growth; it protects them from asthma and respiratory illness;15 it ensure s plentiful calcium that is easily assimilated for stron g teeth and bones. For the elderly , raw milk is equally nourishing; it protects the bones and nourishes the tissues, even when the digestive fires have waned. Raw milk is an excellent source of glutathione, a compound our bodies use for detoxification. Only glutathione from fresh, denatured whey proteins will work\u2014that means from raw milk, not from pasteurized milk or whey powders. Alexey V . Polonikov of Kursk State Medical University proposes that \"glutathione deficiency is exactly the most plausible explanation for serious manifestation and death in Covid-19 infected patients.\"16 R aw milk can be of immense help in protecting us from this disease. Another important source of nutrients missing from modern diets: gelatin-rich bon e broth made from the bones and cartilaginous portions of the anim al, which nourishes the cartilage in our own bodies\u2014and our bodies contain more cartilage than muscle. Bone broth is rich in glycine, an essential element in collagen that helps maintain structured water inside and outside of cells. Glycine helps create strong collagen in certa in types of lung surfactants and throughout the body , and it supports detoxification. Animal feet, heads, bones, an d skin did not go to waste in your grandmother ' s kitchen. They were thrown into a pot and simm ered on the back of the stove to make a ri ch broth\u2014basically melted col lagen. This broth the n forme d the basis for nourishing soups, stews, sauces, and gravies \u2014or given as ju st a mug of broth for optimal ener gy and good d igestion\u2014a much better choice than cof fee! Unfortunately , the food industry has figured out a way to imitate homemade broth\u2014the broth-based gravy that your grandmother ser ved appears in i mitation form as a kind of goop made with water , a thickener , artificial glutamate a neurotoxin. MSG appears in many canned a nd dehydrated soups and stews, bottled sauces, \"broth\" in aseptic containers, salad dressings, seasoning mixes, soy foods (which are intrinsically bitter), and even vegetable oils. Rarely labeled, MSG is a neurotoxin, not a nutrient, and another source of starvation for those who consume mostly processed food. Another important component of traditional nutrient-dense diets is fermented food and beverages. Raw fermented foods supply beneficial bacteria to the i ntestinal tract, preferably on a daily basis. Th ese bacteria help digestion, liberate minerals, break down anti-nutrients, supply vitamins (especially B vitamins), and pro tect us against toxins. In fact, a recent study links fe rmented vegetable consumption to low Covid-19 mortality .17 Fermented condiments like raw pickles and sauerkraut, fermented sauces like ketc hup, and fermented beverages like kefir and kombucha are critical components in a diet that truly nourishes and protects. Unfortunately , the modern diet replaces raw fermented condiments with canned versions, makes heat-treated ketchup loaded with additives, and promotes truly toxic and heavily sweetened soft drinks instead of artisanal fermented beverages. The pub lic first learned about the benefits of lactic acid-pr oducing bacteria in fermented foods, esp ecially fermented milk products like yogurt, from bacteriologist and Nobel Prize winner Ilya Mechnikov , a contemporary of Louis Pasteur . Mechnikov credited with the d iscovery of macrophages, w hich turned out to be the major defense mechanism in our innate im mune s ystem. He proposed the theory that white blood cells could engulf and destroy toxins and bacteria, which met with skepticism from Pasteur and others. At the time, most bacteriologists\u2014always as suming that natural processes are detrimental\u2014believed that white blood cells ingested pathogens and then spread them further through the body . Unlike Pasteur , who believed that all bacteria were bad, Me chnikov credited the good health and longevity of Bulgarian peasants to their daily consumption of (fermented) yogurt and the lactic acid-producing bacteria it contained. Mechnikov , a colorful and passionate figure, twice attempted suicide\u2014 the first time b y an opium ov erdose and the second time b y injecting himself with the spirochete of relapsing fever (akin to malaria).18 He concluded that it was his habit of eating Bulgarian yogurt that protected him against the spirochete toxins and allowed him to survive. He also experimented on himself and others by drinking cholera bacteria during the 1892 ch olera ep idemic in France. He and one volunteer did not get sick, but another volunte er almost died. He then discovered that some microbes hindered the cholera growth, w hereas others stimulated the production of cholera toxins. He concluded that the proper cultivation of intestinal flora could pr otect ag ainst deadly diseases like cholera.19 W e get these protective bacteria on a daily basis when we eat lacto-fermented food. An i mportant component of fermented foods is vitamin C. Successful treatments for Covid-19 cases include lar ge doses of vitamin C (oral or IV). Y our best dietary source is fermented veggies like sauerkraut, which is manyfold richer in vitamin C than is fresh cabbage. The foo d-processing technology that accompanied the In dustrial Revolution has allowed us to ruin just about every common ingredient that we p ut into our mouths, even salt. Salt is a critical nutrient for health, and especially for maintaining the dif ference in electrical potential in our tissues, which can protect us against EMFs. But modern processing removes all the magnesium and trace minerals from salt, and it adds an aluminum compound that preve nts clumping\u2014so your salt will pour when it ra ins. The solution is to use unrefined salt on your food a nd in your cooking, salt that contains a wealth of trace minerals and provides us with a daily source of magnesium. One and one-half teaspoons of unrefined salt (the minimum adult requiremen t for sodium and chloride) actually provides about twice the minimum adult requirement for magnesium. Now tak e your diet of processed food\u2014your frozen dinner , your canned soup, y our carryout meal, and your leftovers\u2014and zap it with the microwave. Little that nourishes will be left in such food-like substances.20 The imp ression created in numerous books and in the media is that a \"healthy\" diet is dry and unsatisfying\u2014containing skinless chicken breasts, lean me at, vegetable juices, and rough whole grains\u2014could not be further from the truth. A healthy diet requires no sacrifice in taste and satisfaction, only care in pu rchasing and preparing our food. Rich, whole raw dairy products includ ing plenty of butter , fatty meats, natural bacon and charcuterie, eggs (especially the yolks), artisan sourdough bread, genuine bone broth, satisfying sauces, natural sweeteners, plentiful unrefined salt, interesting cond iments, and refreshing fermented beverages\u2014these provide the kind of diet that truly nouri shes and protects\u2014and they are becoming more and more available commercially . If your diet contains mostly processed foods, you can be assured that your body is in starvation mode\u2014 especially if you heat up your food in a microwave oven. For practical suggestions on adopting a nutrient-dense diet, see Appendix C.CHAPTER 10 T O X I N S In chapter 3 , we looked at some of the toxins that cause disease\u2014 mistakenly attributed to microbes\u2014in times past. Those dwell ing in cities and tow ns lived in constant danger of exposure to poisonous gases from sewage and manure. V olatile compounds like hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, methane, esters, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides can kill peo ple through asphyxia tion when they are exposed to high concentrations. Other ef fects include eye irritation, nausea, and breathing dif ficulty . Our ancestors were also exposed on a daily basis to dioxins and other toxins in smoke\u2014from fires bu ilt for warmth, cooking, and m etal work. Even tod ay , smoke from cooking fires is a major source of air pollution in the d eveloping world, especially smoke from open fires inside houses and huts. Our anc estors al so had to conten d with toxic metals: lead used in pipes, cooking vessels, building materials, and cosmetics; arsenic us ed in metal alloys, c osmetics, and medical treatments; and mercury used in ointments and medicines, cosmetics, metal amalgams, and silver mining. Although today we recognize th e extreme toxicity of these sub stances, they have not gone away , especi ally arsenic. Contamination of groundwater with ars enic is a problem that a f fects millions of people across the world.1 Heavily used as an insecticide in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, arsenic use in produce production is no longer common (except in cotton farming); however , its use as a feed additive in poultr y and swine production, especially in the United States, has increased. For example, an arsenic-containing feed additive called roxarsone is used b y about 70 percent of US poultry growers.2 The first edition of The Mer ck Manual fe atured many mercury-based medicines. A \"tonic\" containing mercury constituted the standard treatment for syphilis, the classic example of a deadly medicine far worse than the disease it was d esigned to treat. Use of mercury in medicine h as declined, although some over -the-counter drugs including topical antiseptics, stimulant laxatives, diaper -rash ointment, eye drops, and nasal sprays contain mercury compounds. The main medical uses for mercury today are in denta l amalgams (which constantly outgas mercury into the mouth and sinus cavities3) and as a vaccine preservative called thimerosal.4 After studies showing that the amount of mercury in the childhood vaccination schedule recommended by the CDC exceeded all national and global maximum safety limits, public pressure forced manufacturers to remove thimerosal or reduce it to trace amounts in all US vaccines recommended for children six years of age and under . But manufacturers did not remove mercury from the multi-dose vials of the inactivated flu vaccine, which is given to pregnant women, children under the age of one, and, of course, adults. The result is that if the flu vaccine is added to a child' s vaccine schedule, he is likely to get more mercury in his bloodstream tha n he did before the removal of thimerosal from the other childhood vaccinations.5 Sm all amounts of mercury r esidues from the manufacturing process still remain in most vaccines. The indu strial us e of mercury has declined, but it is still an ingredient in some measuring instruments, and it fills fluorescent lamps, including those compact bulbs that have lar gely replaced incandescent light bulbs. If they break in your ho use, you and your family will be exposed to to xic mercury fumes; i f they break in a landfill, the mercury will pollute the soil and groundwater . Cyanide compounds are a by-product of many industrial processes, such as oil refining and the production of polyurethanes. Many cyanide compounds are toxic; they can prevent the production of A TP the system and the heart, le ading to hypoxia (oxygen deprivation), a common symptom of t he Covid-19 illness.6 Cigarette smoke is an undisclosed source of cyanide compounds.7 Humanity is also exposed t o formaldehyde, benzene, cadmium, phthalates, fluoride, and chloride compounds in drinking water (including chloramines, pre ferred by public water agencies because they persist and do not break down over time), and a host of pesticides, including the highly toxic cholinesterase inhibitors (nervous system poisons) sprayed on citrus fruit. These make their way into milk, butter , yogurt, and cheese via citrus peel cake fed to dairy cows. T oxins i n food range from propylene glycol (an antifreeze)\u2014added to ice cream to ke ep it soft and creamy; formaldehyde and met hyl alcohol (breakdown products of the artificial sweetener aspartame); the artificial sweetener aces ulfame-K; doug h conditioners; artificial col orings and flavorings (inclu ding MSG); preservatives; artificial vitamins gallate, and te rt-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), which are added to vegetable oils and fried foods such as potato chips. Those with preexisting conditio ns like diabetes, obesity , hypertension, and hear t disease\u2014those who are most vulnerable to the illness attributed to coronavirus\u2014are likely to have developed these conditions in lar ge part due to processed foods loaded with these additives. How much they contribute to this disease is impossible to say , but it is reasonable to speculate that processed foods containing these and other chemicals play a role as cofactors in the coronavirus illness, indeed in any disease. The standard American diet (SAD) not only starves our tissues, but it also p oisons them at the same time. Researcher Step hanie Senef f, PhD, has pointed out the fact that the early epicenters of Covid-19 co rrespond with areas of high air pollution\u2014 W uhan, China; the tristate region (New Y ork, New Jersey , Connecticut); northern Italy; Spain; and Jef f erson Parish, Louisiana\u2014and particularly with the use of biodiesel. She notes that a Harvard Institute for Public Health s tudy found a strong cor relation between exposure to particulate air pollution and Covid-19 deaths.8 The researchers found that an increase of only one microgram per cubic meter in fine particulate matter was associated with a 15 percent increase in the Covid-19 fatality rate. It bears repeating that atmospheric dust (that is, pollution) can exacerbate the ef fects of EMFs.9 Senef f notes that New Y ork relies heavily on biodiesel fuel for public vehicles, and New Y ork State has a lar ge number of manufacturing plants where biomass from various sources, including used cooking oil, is processed into biofuels. The state also encourages the use of biofuel for home heating oil. Biodiesel and biofuel made from plants contain the herbicide glyphosate (Roundup), which S enef f believes has a unique mechanism of toxicity . She points to a case of a mechanic who tried to clea n a clogged applicator for glyphosate-based herbicide using a bucket of die sel fuel as a solvent. He quickly developed a bad cough and started coughing up blood. Rushed to the hospital, he was diagnosed with pneumonitis, an inflammatory disease of the lungs caused by exposure to toxic substances.10 Senef f postulate s that the or ganic molecules in diesel fuel enha nce the uptake of glyphosate in the lung cells by acting as a surfactant.1 1 Glyphosate substitutes for the amino acid glycine found in cartilage, numerous enzym es, and important lung surfactants, leading to a myriad of problems, including lung disease. Senef f points out that many US Covid-19 hot spots include major ports such as Seattle, Los Angeles, N ew Orleans, Boston, and New Y ork. She notes that air pollution from ship s is more toxic than air pollution from land vehicles, because ships use the lowest grade of diesel fuel.12 In Europe, over 20 percent of a utomobiles are powered by diesel fuel versus 2 percent in the United S tates. Unable to keep up with the demand for diesel fuel, Europe imports biodiesel (made primarily from GMO Roundup Ready soy) from Ar ge ntina. The Chinese produce biodiesel from canola (rapeseed), which is highly sprayed with Roundup, much of which grows along the Y angtze River , which cuts through W uhan. In th e United St ates, three cities have adopted biodiesel for veh icle use on the roads\u2014New Y ork (which powered eleven thousand vehicles at least partially on biodiesel as of 20 17), New Orleans (which uses biofuel in buses), and W ashington, DC\u2014 all Covid-19 hot spots. All cro ps used for biodiesel in the United States are Roundup Ready crops sp rayed with glyphosate\u2014corn, soy , canola, and hardwood trees. A viation biofuel is another potential source of airborne glyphosate, first introduced by United Airlines and now in use by at least four airlines using New Y ork City airports. The New Y ork borough most af fected by coronavirus is Queens, on the flight paths of New Y ork' s three major airports (La Guardia, JFK, and Newark) and intersected by three major interstate highways (I-278, I-495, and I-678). In Britain: News reports have singled out bus drivers and people living in the town of Slough (adjacent to Heathrow Airport) as being e specially af fected. T est flights and commercial flights runn ing on aviation biofuel blends have been flying into and out of Heathrow since 2008. On the ground, the mayor of London reported in July 2017 that about a third of the city' s nearl y ten thousand buses were runni ng on 20-percent-blends of biodiesel; the mayor also stated that by 2018, London would no longer add pure diesel double-deck buses to its fleet.13 T aiwan has a low rate of coronavirus deaths. T aiwan' s cities hav e plenty of ai r po llution, but not from bio fuels; T aiwan vehicles do not us e biodiesel. In M ay 2014, the state-run o il refining company started phasing out biodiesel fuel production because due to the island' s high humidity , even a 2 percen t biodiesel blend resulted in the growth of microbes that clogged fuel tanks.14 One New England hot spot is Chelsea, Massachusetts, where much biofuel is produced. As of May 1, 2020, Chelsea ranked number one in Massachusetts, with 363 cases per ten thousand people. Brockton, the number -two city , had only 185 cases per ten thousand.15 Glyphosate expo sure comes not just through the air but in our food, and exposure is highest in the United States, which uses the most gly phosate per capita of any country . Senef f attributes the high rate of many chronic diseases, includi ng diabetes, obesity , fatty liver disease, heart disease, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, hypertension, autism, and dementia to glyphosate expo sure. In a 2014 landmark study , Swanson and coauthors showed that many of these chronic diseases are rising in the US population exactly in lockstep with the rise in glyphosate usage, particularly on wheat, which is sprayed with glyphosa te shortly before harvest as a desiccant.16 Whether ingested in food or breathed in from biodiesel, the ef fects of glyphosate are insidious, cumulative, and widespread. According to Senef f, glyphosate' s mechanism of toxicity has to do with a p roposed ability to mistakenly substitute f or the coding amino acid glycine during protein synthesis. This is plausible because glyphosate is a glyc ine molecule\u2014except that there is an additional attachment (a methyl-phosp honyl group) to the nitrogen atom of glycine, wh ich changes the size and chemical and ph ysical properties of the mole cule but does not prevent it from incorporating into a peptide chain. It can be predicted th at certain proteins wi ll be af fected in a devastating way if glyphosate should substitute for particular glycine residues known to be very important for their proper function. I ha ve found that many of the diseases with rising prevalence can be explained through glyphosate substitution in specifi c proteins known to be defective in association with those diseases.17 Starved and poisoned, the typica l American soon develops one or more chronic diseases and seeks medical advice; once in the clut ches of the medical establis hment, he becomes the tar get of more toxins, s tarting with statin drugs. The list of side ef f ects from statin drugs is long and includes muscle pain or cramps, fatigue, fever , memory loss, confusion, diabetes, kidney and liver damage, hea rt failure, and digestive disorders. Most seriously , statins diminish the cholesterol available to cells and diminish the fat-soluble vitamins and other nutrients that are carried in the lipoproteins. W ith statins, your cells are starved of the nutrients they need to produce ener gy a nd keep your intercellular water or ganized. A W enzhou Medical University study found that Covid patients had significantly lower cholesterol levels than did controls.18 In a ddition to statins, most A mericans take other drugs. A study published by the Mayo Clinic19 found that 70 percent of Americans take at least one prescription medicatio n and that 20 percent of Americans are on five or more me dications. These include metformin to lower blood sugar , blood pressure medications inc luding ACE inhibitors (which act on the same rec eptors as exosomes), steroids, antiepileptics, antidepressants, pain medications, stomach acid inhib itors, and antibiotics. Many also take one or more over -the-counter drugs such as T ylenol, cough suppressants, sleep aids, and antacid s. All these drugs have side ef fects, which means that all of them can act as poisons in the body . The side ef fects of ACE-inhibitor blood-pressure-lowering drugs, such as Lisinopril, are similar to those of Covid-19: a dry , persistent cough, dizziness, possible nausea, headache and trouble breathing.20 A final toxin, one that highly impacts our response to electromagnetic radiation, is aluminum, with an electrical conductivity only slightly less than tha t of copper . In fact, ther e are few more biologically rea ctive metals than aluminum. Aluminum binds strongly to oxygen-based compounds such as the phosphate groups in A TP\u2014needed for the production of ener gy . In simple terms, too much aluminum in the body reduces our ener gy . Human exposure in the twenty-first century is especially high. Aluminum is in most public tap water\u2014it is used as a floccula nt to clarify the wate r , and it is dischar ged from fertilizer and aluminum ma nufacturing. Jet e ngines spew aluminum ion s into the air , particularly prob lematic for those living in the flight paths of major airports.21 Aluminum compounds abound in toothpaste, mouthwash, soaps, skin care products, tanning creams, cosmetics, shampoos, hair products, deodorants, baby products, nail polish, perfume, food, food packaging, sunscreen, antacids, and buf fered aspirin. Aluminum levels are especially high in infant formula, particularly soy formula.22 Alumin um leac hes into food from aluminum foil and cookware. Another undisclosed source is marijuana. Users can absorb as much as 3,700 microgram s of aluminum per joint, representing \"a significant risk factor for neurodegeneration.\"23 Aluminum levels are especial ly high in the brains of those with Alzheimer ' s and autism.24 The body has a certain tolerance for aluminum\u2014beneficial gut flora can prevent its absorption and a go od immune system of fers some protection against a irborne aluminum. But the body lacks such tolerance for aluminum injected into the bloodstream. Mercury may have been removed or reduced in vaccines, but not aluminum. In fact, manufacture rs have added more aluminum in order to provoke the production of antib odies, said to prove an \"immune response.\" All of the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccines (DT , DT aP , Td, Tdap, and combination vaccines w ith a DT aP component), Haemophilus influenzae ty pe b (Hib) va ccine, hepatitis A and B and the hepatitis A/B combination vac cines, the meningococcal uman papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines contain aluminum.25 In fact, the newest H PV vaccine (Gardasil-9), recommended for teenage gir ls and boys, contains more than double the amount of aluminum than the original Gardasil vaccine.26 In 2 01 1, distinguished immunol ogist Y ehuda Schoenfeld and colleagues proposed the term \"autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants\" (ASIA) to describe the unusual immune-mediated diseases in humans and animals that appear after injection with aluminum- containing vaccines. ASIA manifests as \"vague and sundry symptoms\u2014 chronic fatigue, muscle and joint pain, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, skin rash es and more.\"27 Aluminum \"accumulates, and the more you put in the system, the more you have. When you inject aluminum, you inject it directly into the immune system.\"28 Th e researchers also noted that a person would have to eat \"one million-fold higher aluminum to get the same le vel of [injected] aluminum adjuvant at the level of the immune cells.\" The amount of aluminum injected into babies via multiple vaccinations exceeds anything that can be considered safe. A baby who receives the recommended eight doses of vaccine at the two-month checkup receives 1,225 mcg of alu minum at once; fully vaccinated babies receive 4,925 mcg by eighteen months. The maximum allowable aluminum (considered safe) per day for intravenous parenteral feeding is 25 mcg.29. Many flu shots given to seniors contain aluminum\u2014along with mercury and othe r contaminants such as formaldehyde and polysorbate 80. Those who received the flu shot in the United States during the 2 017- 2018 influenza season had a 36 percent increased risk of coronavirus illness.30 In northern Italy , a campaign to inject the elderly with new types of influenza vaccines took place in 2018-2019,31 and in June 2019, the Chinese instituted mandatory flu vaccine for all ages.32 W e live in a tox ic world. Add millimeter wave 5G technology to the mix and illness is sure to ensue.CHAPTER 11 M I N D , B O D Y , A N D T H E R O L E O F F E A R Scientists have made two grav e mistakes in their centuries-long quest to understand the human mind. Once we see through these mista kes, a more realistic concept of the \"mind\" can emer ge. It' s imp ortant to understand the mind\u2014what it is and how it works\u2014 because the mind has a lar ge ro le to play in the experience of \" contagion.\" In other words, if we don' t explore the nature of the mind and come to a realistic understanding of how the mind operates, we will fail to understand the conc ept of contagion in ge neral and the experience of Covid-19 in particular . This is because fear , hatred, and lies are key components of the phenomena we call \"sickness\"; these negative emotions and behaviors seem to be \"contagi ous,\" and they are present in the world at almost unprecedented l evels at this tim e. It' s time to integrate the concept of the mind into a realistic framework for health and disease. The firs t mistak e concerning the mind that scientists and res earchers have ma de in past centuries is the assumption that physical matter is the only thi ng that exists. If this is the underlying assumption, then it is only natural to look for a \"physical\" site in which this mind resides and then attempt to understand how the anatomy , chemistry , or physiology of this or gan' s cells create the mind. Scientists have localized the seat of the mindin the brain. They postulate that the brain is made of physic al matter\u2014 chemicals and atoms\u2014and therefore these brain cells must somehow \"secrete\" the mind. The mind m ust be a physical, biochemical product of the brain, much as thyroid hormone is a physical secretion of the thyroid gland. B ut try as they will, the y just can' t come up with the chemical or group o f chemicals that constitutes this mind secreted by the brain. As always, we are told it is just a matter of time, and of course, more funding, for scientists to solve this puzzle. This \"matter\" called the brain is either 99.99 percent empty space (if it exists as a particle) or just wave ener gy (if it exists as a wave). T o complicate matters, these sam e scientists tell us that what determines whether the stuf f that makes up our brains is in the particle or wave form is how the \"mind\" of the scientist is observing the stuf f. In other words, this mind, w hich can ' t be found, act ually determines the form of th e or gan that is su pposedly creating the mind. Thus, the scientists are caught in a Gordian knot. Like a rat trapped in an infinite maze, there is no escap e from this central dilemma. The result is that scientists try to understan d more and more of the conundrum' s detai ls, while never getting to the core of the issue. This is th e central paradox of materialistic science and its of fshoot, materialistic medicine. Most ne uroscientists attempt to find the source of the mind within the or gan they postulate is creatin g the mind\u2014our brain. This is akin to attempting to localize the sourc e of the sound emanating from a radio by dissecting the radio into its component parts. Although a radio is needed to receive a nd play sounds, no one could possibly think the sound originates in the radio. The radio is a receiver , and the more in tune it is to the various waves and frequencies in the world, the better it can function as a receiver . A p erfect radio would theoreti cally be able to pick up any radio wave signals anywher e, if it were powerful enough and tuned enoug h. Dif ferent sizes and types of radios have dif ferent abilities to pick up the varioussignals; no one claims that beca use one radio is small and old a nd picks up only local, strong signals that the other signals don' t exist. It' s clearly all about the power and clarity of the radio one is using. So i t is with the connection between the brain (as the pres umptive \"site\") and mind. The brain is a receiver; it works in conjuncti on with the entire or ganism in a complex dance we call life. The body brings nourishment to the brain; it removes waste products from t he brain; it connects the brain to the senses and to the fingers so they can touch objects and provide the brain with the information it needs in order to work. There is no bod y-mind duality; that is a superstition of mate rialistic scientists. There is a human being, divided up into various water compartments, each working together to create this experience we call life. The inpu t to this experience, as in a radio, comes from the world\u2014actually the u niverse\u2014as a whole. Our b odies (with their respective minds) are the receivers for this input in the form of electromagnetic waves. And, since we now know that every \"substance\" is also its own form of wave, there is a natural resonanc e created when the ener gy of the world meets th e or ganized water crystal known as the human being. The result of this resonance is output, otherwise known as thoughts, feelings, and actions. The mind is simply a made-up concept for this dance of life\u2014input from the world, received in the form of resonance by our or ganism, leading to the creation of output in the form of thoughts, feelings, and actions. The second mistake is failing to understand the role that water , in its crystalline nature, plays in this resonance phenomena. One important clue that water is the crucial elemen t in the creation of this mind we call the human o r ganism is that the or g an that serves as the primary receiver of thought waves\u2014the brain\u2014is al so the or gan with the highest water content \u2014it is 80 percent water by vo lume (about 10 percent higher than other or gans). Not only is the brain the or gan that has the highest amount of crystalline water , it even floats in or ganized, structured cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) thereby achieving the remarkable feat of overcoming gravity . W ithout this salty CSF bath, the brain would feel too heavy to ca rry around; the brain would push against the skull, thereby cutting of f its own circulation. Life is a manifestation of the fo rce of levity\u2014plants grow up, s ap rises in trees, and animals stand and walk; in contrast, mineral substances succumb to gravity . Life would be impossible if \"gravity ruled\" in the human being. Fortunately , the brain floats upward in its pool of salty , crystalline fluid. Levity , like a plant growing up toward the sun, is the basic expression of living beings. This or ganized water known as the brain, floating in its bath of c rystalline fluid, serves as a perfectly tuned receiver for the thoughts of the wor ld. This is an exact description given by the most s ophisticated scientists, inventors, musicians, artists, writers, and poets. Universally , they describe the experience of working on themselves in one way or another\u2014 thinking, practic ing, studying\u2014and then one day , the inspiration or thought simply comes to them to beco me Newton' s theories, Beethoven' s ninth symphony , or Isaac Singer ' s sewing machine. W e have all had the experience of receiving a thought and knowing it is right, or having pondered a question for many years and suddenly receiving the answer . Somewhere, som ehow , thoughts (all these various wave forms) exist. It' s just a matter of tuning our watery brains to pick them up clearly . This bri ngs us to \"Covid-19\" and the experience of fear . Whether by design or by ac cident, humanity is currently bathed in the wa veforms of fear , hat red, and lies. No sensible person could possibly deny this. People don' t know whom to believe , which news report is accu rate, which scientists or government of ficials are lying or which are telling the truth. W e have bee n told to fear and suspect each other as carriers of de adly germs; any and all dif ferences between us, even things as superficial as the color of a person' s skin, are grounds for even more fear , suspicion, and hatred. It isnot hyperbole to claim that eve ry single person on earth is now bathed in this sea of fear , hatred, and lies. This is what is picked up by all living or ganisms as the predominant waveforms in the world. Naturally , these waveforms c reate physiological responses in our bodies, such as activation of our inflammatory systems, as we attempt to rid ourselves of these destructive thought patterns. Our cortisol production increases, adren aline soars, blood flow constricts, and pupils dilate as we prepare to escape this danger . W e have been poisoned, drowned in this toxic brew , deep into our watery structures. W e a lso know that exposing or g anisms to fear stimulates the cre ation of exosomes to detoxify this fear . S cientists have mistakenly labeled these tiny bodies \" viruses\"\u2014poisons. They are not pathogenic viruses; t hey are the natural human response to fear , lies, hatred, and other toxins. Exosomes are nature' s way of letting us know that unless we rid ourselves of these toxic thoughts, health y life is not possible. Masks, social distancing, closing businesses, viol ence, and racial intolerance are just some of the forms of fear -inducing str ategies to which humans are subjected. Human beings need love, trust, and acceptance to g row and thrive. These waveforms are out there as well. Our challenge is to learn how to tune into these good emotions rather than the things that bring illness and death.PART 3 CHOICESCHAPTER 12 Q U E S T I O N I N G C O V I D The firs t case of illness attri buted to a \"contagious\" or ganism called coronavirus occ urred in China in November 2019; the illness appeared in the Unit ed State s in January 2020. By the end of June, halfway through the year , health of ficials could cite t en million cases with a half a m illion deaths worldwide.1 The of ficial numbers in the United States are about 2.5 million cases with 126,000 deaths,2 or a dea th rate of about 5 percent. The of ficial cause: person-to -person transmi ssion of a \"novel\" a ty pe of virus called co ronavirus, an or ganism listed in textbooks as causing mild upper respiratory symp toms or the common cold.3 Of f icials and th e media have studiously avoided mentioning any possible connection with the stealthy installation of 5G antennas, firs t in lar ge cities and then in sm aller towns. These antennas are deliberately inconspicuous, hardly noticeable on city streets. A la r ge portion of these deaths (43 percent or higher) have occ urred in nursing homes or long-term-care facilities.4 The elderly are the most vulnerable, with an average age at death of seventy-nine years . Nearly all victims have comorbidities such as obesity , diabetes, high bloo d pressure, and hea rt disease, which means they are probably taking several toxic drugs, like metformin for dia betes, ACE-2 inhibitors for high blood pressure, and statin drugs to lower cholesterol. According to Silvio Brusaferro, president of the Italian Higher Institute, Italian medical records indicate that \"there may be only two people who died from coronavirus in Italy , who did not present other pathologies.\"5 In the early days of the illness, many ar gued that the threat of coronavirus was exaggerated. In March, Stanford Professor John Ioannides claimed that health of ficials were severely overreacting to coronavirus, suggesting that \"the response to the coronavirus pandemic may be 'a fiasco in the making' b ecause we are making seismic decisions based on 'utterly unreliable' data.\"6 A re port from March 9, 2020, shows deaths attributed to Cov id-19 at fifty-six per day , versus malaria at two thousand per day and TB at three thousand per day7\u2014hardly a mortality rate that justifies pandemic status, especially as physicians report receiving pressure to write C ovid as the cause of death on death certificates.8 Hospitals have ample reason to list Covid as a cause for admission; they receive $13,000 from Medicare when they list a patient labeled as \"C ovid\" compared to only $4,600 for simple pneumonia. If the patient is put on a ventilator , Medicare pays the hospital $39,000.9 T hese financial incentives mad e it easy to ar gue that the Covi d- 19 incident and mortality rates were inflated. Early analyses of the US death rate claimed a \"virtually none xistent\" increase in the number of US deaths during the first seventeen weeks of 2020 co mpared with the same period in 2019. But using more complete CDC da ta reveals that over a twelve-week period (February thro ugh April), Covid-19 claimed more lives than did accidents, stroke, diabetes, suicide, and other conditions. Covid-19 was third in the list of leading causes of death in the United States during the twelve-week period. The overall US death rate was 4-5 percent higher than it was in the same period in 2019.10 Some have claimed that Covid deaths are mostly iatrogenic\u2014that is, caused by the medical care patients receive and by the many toxic drugs they are taking.1 1 T ypically , a Covid-19 patient receives the antiviral remdesivir and is put on a ventilator . Like AZT for AID S patients, remdesivir was developed to treat another disease\u2014hepatitis C, for which it did not work a s hoped\u2014and dusted of f to give to Covid-19 patients. Adverse ef fects include respiratory failure and or gan impairment, low albumin, low potassium, low red blood cell count, low platelet count, gastrointestinal distress, elevated liver enzymes, and reaction a t the site of injection.12 In the early days of the pandem ic, the media reported a rush to produce enough ventilato rs to satisfy the expected demand for them. But the much- hyped ventilato r turned out to be a death sentence. According to one analysis, among patients sixty-six years and older hospitalized in the New Y ork Ci ty region, those put on ventilators had a 97.2 percent mortality rate.13 In an April 22, 2020, article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association , an analysis of 5,700 Covid-1 9 patients hospitalized between March 1 and April 4 found that the overall death rate was 21 percent, but it rose to 88 per cent for those who received mechanical ventilation.14 Bad me dical ca re was not the only factor that contributed to the high death rate; the other was almost certainly terror and loneliness. When tagged with a d iagnosis of Covid-19\u2014either from a putative positive test result or no test at all\u2014patients often found themselves locked up against their wills in elder care facilities and shut of f from the outside world\u2014no visits from family or friends permitted. Although many ar gue that the rates of illness blamed on the coro navirus have bee n inflated, and that Cov id-19 is no worse than a bad case of the flu, the possibility exists that the numbers have been under reported. Many suf fer ill ness and never report it\u2014minorities and those living in poverty , but also thos e who mistrust the med ical system; and we have no idea how many are r eally getting sick in China or in countries formerly of the Communist world. T he PCR tests give fals e positives, but also false negatives, which means that many may suf fer a mild form of the illness without a diagnosis. More important, it is clear that symptoms of Covid-19 are not the same as those of the ordinary flu. Autopsy reports have found that the lungs of Covid victims contain microscopic blood clots\u2014something that does not happen in flu patients. In lar ger blood vessels of the lungs, the number of blood clots is similar among Covid-19 and flu patients. However , capillaries in C ovid-19 patients have nine times more blood clots than do those in flu victims. The capillaries are in t he small air sacs that allow oxygen to pass into the bloodstr eam and carbon dioxide to move out. Actually , pathologists are finding clots in almost every or gan.15 The dam age, of course, is blame d on the wily virus: \"The novel coronavirus is . . uses tools to infect our cells and replicate.\"16 According to Professor Mauro Giacca of King' s College London, Covid-19 often leaves lungs completely unrecognizable. \"What you find in the lungs of peo ple who have sta yed with the disease for more than a month before dying is something completely dif ferent from normal pneumonia, influenza or the SARS virus. Y ou see massive thrombosis. There is a complete disruption of the lung architecture\u2014in some lights you can' t even distinguish that it used to be a lung.\" \"There are lar ge numbers of very big fused cells which are virus positive with as many as 10, 15 nuclei,\" he reported. \"I am convinced this explains the unique pathology of Covid-19. This is not a disease caused by a virus which kills cells, which has profound implications for therapy .\"17 The \"vir uses\" of course are exos omes trying to remove toxins fr om the lung cells; but they a re apparently no match for serious EMR poisoning, which seems to completely disrupt the structure of lung cells. A key symptom of Covid-19 is prolonged and progressive hypoxia\u2014 meaning that the body is starved for oxygen. This happen s when the hemoglobin molecule releases its iron molecule. Unattached iron in the bloodstream is reactive and tox ic, but normally iron is tucked away in the hemoglobin mo lecule\u2014the iron is caged, so to speak, and car ried around safely by hemog lobin. (V itamin C has an important role to play in cleaning up rampaging iron ions.) W ithout the iron ion, hemoglo bin can no longer bind to oxygen, so cannot c arry oxygen to the ce lls. Meanwhile, the released iron does its reactive damage everywhere in the body . Damage to the lungs shows up in CT scans. The kidneys release hormones like erythropoietin, which tell your bone marrow to ramp up production of hemoglobin. The con ventional explanation fo r the release of iron from hemoglobin is the action of g lycoproteins in the coronavirus\u2014but the acti on of 5G' s millimeter wave s is an equally good explanation, especially those at 60 GHz, which disrupt oxygen molecules. An interesting observation about lung malfunction in Covid-19 patients is that it is bilateral (both lungs at the same tim e), whe reas ordinary pneumonia typically af fects only one lung.18 What kind of virus knows to attack both lungs? A study from W uhan showed that more than one-third of coronavirus patients had neurologic symptom s including dizziness, headache s, impaired consciousness, skeletal-muscle injury , and loss of smell and taste\u2014and more rarely seizures and stroke.19 T his is not your normal flu, this is a serious disease. Moreover , in late March, reports of Covid-19 deaths in infants began to appear .20 In the e arly months, the diseas e mostly af flicted the elderly , but doctors are observing an increase in an inflammatory system called Kawasaki disease, which af flicts children and teenagers. Called \"pediatric multi-system drome temporally associated w ith Covid- 19,\" it is diagnosed on the basis of symptoms. These sympto ms include high fev er , rash on trunk and gro in, extremely red eyes, dry cracked red lips and a strawberry-red swollen to ngue, redness and extensive peeling of the hands and feet, and swollen l ymph nodes. Severe abdomina l pain and gastrointestinal symptoms, inflammation of the heart muscle, and markers of cardiac injury are other typical symptoms of Kawasaki disease.21 However , ironically , the overall death rate among children has declined during t he pandemic lockdown , from seven hundred deaths per week to well under five hundred by m id-April and throughout May , a change attributed to parents not keeping their children up with draconian vaccination schedules.22 Since remdesivir gave disappointing results, health of ficials are seeking other remedies. One suggestion is dexamethasone, a potent steroid that can shrink the brain. Dexametha sone makes sense if Covid-19 is an inflammation rather than an \"infection.\"23 In fact, one of the first things medical students learn is that steroids like dexamethasone make infections worse. Since dexamethasone may make Covid-19 better , this demonstrates that the illness can' t be an infection. Another proposed treatment is the drug Haldol (haloperidol), sometimes called vitamin H.24 Haldol is one of the most potent antipsychotic medications in existence\u2014it puts the patient into a kind of drooling stupor . Doctors and scientists from Fran when nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory such as ibuprofen are given to Covid-19 patients.25 N SAID S can cause internal ble eding, as do ACE inhibitor blood pressure medications. Of ficial policy states that no co ronavirus drug is universally safe and ef fective and discourages nonto xic or holistic treatments, but the lack of successful treat ments from mainstream medicine has patie nts seeking alternatives. A report at the end of March brought attention to the work of Dr . Vladimir Zelenko, a New Y ork physician who claims to have treated almost seven hundred coronavirus patients with 100 percent success using a malaria drug called hydroxychloroquine sulfate with supplemental zinc, a treatment that costs only twenty dollars over a period of five days.26 Success is probably due to the patient receiving zinc and sulfur . A study published on May 22 with great media attention in both The Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine claimed that the treatment was useless and war ned that it could possib ly cause death. But on June 4, The Lancet retracted the study and apologiz ed to its readers. \"The study was withdrawn because the company that provided data would not provide full access to the info rmation for a third-party peer review . . . Based on this development, we can no longer vouch for the veracity of the primary data sources.\"27 Dr . David Brownstein reports no hospitalizations in eighty-five patients diagnosed with either Covid or suspected Covid using vitamins A, C, and D, h ydrogen peroxide, and iodi ne, while advising patients to avoid the flu vaccine.28 Ozone is another promising therapy .29 Other proposed alternative treatments include acetazolamide (altitude sickness drug), hydrogen peroxide IV , vitamin C IV , hype rbaric oxygen, hydrogen gas, and chlorine dioxide,30 but none of these are available in hospitals. After Memorial Day , Covid-19 hot spots flared in Arizona, Oklahoma, South C arolina, and Florida, which of ficials blamed on relaxed mitigation ef forts\u2014having fun at the beach or visiting bars, not wearing face masks, and not practicing social distan cing. According to one of ficial, \"There are certain c ounties where a majority of the people who are tested positive in that cou nty are under the age of thirty , and this typically results from people going to bars.\"31 Are these new cases simply due to increased testing with many false positives?\" Or to the wily virus infecting people wit h person-to- person t ransmission? Or to the continued deployment of 5G technology to smaller cities and to the Southw est, and longer exposure to 5G as the weeks and months go by? In m id-June, government agenci es could point to an increase in cases in T exas, A labama, and V ir ginia. \"The findings indicate that the r isk for lar ge second waves of outbreaks remains low if communities continue to implement cauti ous, incrementa l planned re-openings that limit crowding and travel to non-essential businesses . . . without vigilance in masking, hygiene and disinfection, certain southern counties will remain h igh risk.\"32 Health of ficials warned that opening states too soon could have \"disastrous consequences.\" In early July , T exas reversed course and mandated masks. Although increa sed testing with the useless PCR test has undoubtedly generated higher numbers of Covid cases, hospitalizations have also increased. The curve has not flattened, it' s going up again.33 Hospitalizations have also gone up in California, in spite of str ict masking and social distancing measures there since early in the year . Sweden initially appeared as a bright spot among nations by for going a mandatory lockdown, with fa ctories, businesses, bars, and restaurants remaining open , and a lower illness and death rate than other European nations. Whereas tourism came to a halt in the rest of Europe, it flourished in Sweden. However , case numbers and deaths began to rise in April, with the tota l number of deaths no w over five thousand. W as this because Sweden failed to follow lockdown and mask mandates? Or was it the rollout of 5G, beginning in Mar ch? An April 6 article stated: \"Sweden is in the p rocess of introducing super -fast 5G mobile telecoms networks, giving users se veral times faster web speeds compared with existing 4G technology .34 Sweden' s first Covid-19 death was March 10.35 The fac t that no explosion of cases occurred in lar ge cities a fter the Memorial Day protests has puz zled health of ficials. Areas of unrest like New Y ork, Chicago, Minneapo lis, and W ashington, DC did n ot see any increase in cases even though t housands of protesters did not wear masks nor practice social distancing. O f the thirteen cities involved, o nly Phoenix saw an increase in cases and hospitalizations, which of ficials b lamed on a decision to end Arizona' s stay-at-home order and ease restrictions on businesses: \"Arizona residents w ho were cooped up for six weeks flooded Phoenix-area ba r districts, ignoring social distancing guideli nes.\"36 The wily cor onavirus apparently zero ed in on these law-abiding citizens, but not on protesters crowding the streets. The of ficial government policies for curtailing Covid-19 are self- isolation, social distancing, hand washing, surface cleaning (en vironmental hygiene), and face masks\u2014because \"Coronavirus can spread by just talking or breath ing.\" The only recommended treatment for those in an acute stage of infection is ventilation. Many ha ve poin ted out that the pores in even the best facemasks (even the N95 respirators) are ten times lar ger than any \"virus.\" A study published in May 2020 in Emer ging Infectious Diseases r evi ewed the ev idence for the ef fectiveness of \"nonpharmace utical personal me asures and environmental hygiene measures in nonhealthcare settings.\" T he evidence from fourteen randomized cont rolled trials of these measures did not find that hand washing, environmental hygiene, or use of face masks had any ef fect on reducing transmission of so-called infectious diseases.37 What' s more, la bels on boxes of masks specifically warn that the masks \"will not provide any protection against COVID-19 (Coronavirus) or other viruses or contaminants.\" Moreover , wear ing a mask can cause serious adverse health ef fects, including headaches, increased airway resistance, carbon dioxide accumulation, and hypoxia, especially the tight-fitting N95 respirator mask.38 In one study one-third of hea lth-care workers wearing the N95 respirator mask developed headaches and 60 percent required pain medications for relief.39 W e aring a mask can cause a reduction in blood oxygenation (hy poxia) or an elevation in blood CO2 (hypercapnia). The N95 ma sk, if worn for hours, can reduce blood oxygenation as much as 20 percent, which can lead to loss of consciousness. The Occupational Safety and Hea lth Administration (OS HA) warns that masks risk creating a low oxygen environment and are not ef fective in preventing disease.40 Recently two boys in China fe ll dead wearing masks while running during physical education classes.41 Nevertheless, Los Angeles of ficials have decreed that Angelinos mu st wear a face covering while outdoors. The new law requires face coverings for walking, running, cycling, scooting, roller skating, skateboarding, an d all outdoor activities except f or those on the water .42 A recent review of the science relevant to Covid-19 social policy concluded that masks and respir ators don' t work. \"No [randomized control trial] stu dy with verified outcome shows a benefit for [health-care workers] or community members in households to wearing a mask or respirator . There is no such study . There are no exceptions. Likewise, no study exists that shows a benefit from a broad policy to wear masks in public. . . . Furthermore, if there were any benefit to wearing a mask due to their blocking power against droplets and aerosol particles, then there should be more benefit from wearing a r espirator (N95) compared with a sur gical mask, yet several lar ge meta-ana lyses, and all the RCT [random ized control trials], prove that there is no such relative benefit.\" 43 As for social distancing, health of ficials have put a guilt trip on the whole w orld by warning that a symptomatic carriers (those who carry the virus but have no symptoms of disease) could \"fuel the spread\" of the disease by stealth. An article published at GreenMedInfo.com lists thirteen studies s howing that social distancing increases mortality in heart patients and those with diabetes, causes depression, and generally shortens life.44 Moreover , such policies do no good. In June, Dr . Maria V an Kerkhove, head of th e WHO' s e mer ging diseases and zoonosis unit, announced , \"From the data we have, it still seems to be rare that an asymptomatic person actually transmits onward to a secondary individual.\" 45 As f or environmental sanitation , some of the guidelines borde r on the ridiculous. One article suggests that flushing the toilet without a lid could spread coronavirus.46 The theory is that through flushing one' s stool down the toile t it gets aerosolized into the air . Obviously , you can' t transfer the virus to yourself so it' s not a b ig deal if you watch the contents of your toilet ge t flushed away . And me mbers of your household have already been exposed to your \"viruses,\" so the real risk is for those who invite groups of strangers to watch their stool get flushed down the toilet. Citizens are warned to refrain from this dangerous habit. Even though the science does not support social distancing and the use of mask s as a way to control disease, school of ficials ar e seriously proposing masks and social distancing for grade schoolers when they return to th e classroom in September . The school district of New Albany , Ohio, has take n such policies even further . In addition to masks and social distancing, the school district would require each student to wear an electronic beaco n to track their location to within a few feet thr oughout the day . The device will record wh ere students sit in each classroo m, show to whom t hey mee t and talk, and reveal how they gather in groups. These devices could also be used on younger students who do not have smart- phones.47 T o compile all the data from the tracking beacons, the schools will need the kind of powerful W i-Fi service that only 5G\u2014mo unted inside the buildings\u2014can supply W ithout the virus theory\u2014and even with the virus theory\u2014masks, social distancing , and lockdown make no sense. Ironically , the advent of 5G and EMF s from cell phones and other devices gives us good reason to avoid crowded situatio ns. T ake choir practice, with a few dozen people in close quarters, most with cell phones in their pockets and possibly a cell phone tower in the church steeple: this is the perfect situation for cre ating illness in electrically sensitive individuals. Think m eatpacking plants with hundreds of people standing at close quarters, all with cell phones, po ssibly with 5G installed inside the building to tr ack product, and the added electro-smog stress of conveyer belts and the constant whirring electrical machinery . (W orkers in small plants, typically located in more rural areas and lacking conveyer bel ts and other electrical equipment, will be less vulnerable.) Think schools, of fice buildings, universities, and stadiums\u2014w here 5G is planned, and indeed has been installed covertly (under the guise of disinfecting) during the coronavirus lockdown. The new wav e of illness predicted in September is likely , with students going back to classrooms, newly wired for 5G (and again, most with cellphones).48 Or imagine tens of thousands crowded into a stadium, now fitted out with 5G so everyone can use thei r phones. \"V erizon is building its 5G Ultra W ideband network to support transform ational changes across multiple industries including sports and entertainment,\" said Kyle Malady , V erizon' s ficer . \"This ne xt generation technolog y can enhance the fan experience with the potential to revolutionize the way sports are viewed and played. Faster download speeds, higher bandwidth and lower latency on 5G-enabled mobile devices with V erizon' s 5G Ultra W ideband service is just the beginning.\"49 Outbreaks of illness in factories, schools, theaters, and stadiums are sure to happen, and will appear to confirm the contagious virus theory . Health o f ficials who have predicted a \"second wave\" in September will have the satisfaction of being right . . . and the justification to proceed with their promised solution: a vaccine. CHAPTER 13 A V A C C I N E F O R C O V I D - 1 9 The story of vaccination be gins in 1796 with Edward Jenner of Gloucestershire, who administered the first vaccine against smallpox. At that time, many country folk observed that dairymaids generally had beautiful unmarked skin, proof they had never contracted smallpox. The reason, some claimed, was that their exposure to cowpox, said to be a mild bovine variation of smallpox, gave them immunity to the human form of the disease. Some country folk bel ieved the superstition that after a case of cowpox, you could never get smallpox\u2014a belief contradicted by the observations of physicians at the time.1 Of c ourse, there is a far bette r explanation for the beautiful skin of milkmaids\u2014unlike most people of the time, they had daily access to a superb source of nutrition (including a rich source of vitamin C) and nature' s premier probiotic food. Good nutrition (including good probiotics) protected milkmaids against diseases like smallpox\u2014good nutrition protects all of u s from disease. Of course, preventing bedbugs with good sanitation also plays an important role, but it is unlikely that milkmaids slept in clean be ds. If they did get bitten, the superb nutrition of their milk- based diet protected them. On May 14, 1796, Jenner teste d his hypothesis by inoculating James Phipps, an eight-year -old boy w ho was the son of Jenner ' s gardener . He scraped pus from cowpox blisters on the hands of a milkmaid and scraped the pus into the arm of the child. Jenner excelled at self-promotio n, and in 1802, the English government awarded him ten thousand pounds for continued \"experimentation.\" Jenner claimed that his vaccine gave perfect immunity for life. Un fortunately , statistics taken from Reports of the Registrar General of England indicate that the vaccine was not a success, with deaths from vaccination outnumbering deaths from smallpox up through the early 1900s.2 In 1831, a smallpox outbreak in W urtember g, Germany , claimed the live s of almost one thou sand pe ople who had re ceived a vaccination; and in the same year , two thousand vaccinated people in Marseilles, France developed smallpox. In 1 854-1863, following the introduction of compulsory vaccination programs in Europe, smallpox claimed over thirty-three thousand lives, and other epidemics followed, epidemics in which thousands of vaccinated people died. Compulsory vacc ination laws in England were repealed in 1907, by that time their failure too obvious to disguise. During one of the worst smallpox epidemics in England, between 1870 and 187 2, the city of Leicester took a dif ferent approach. They instituted a system o f good sanitation and quarantine, with the result that there was only one death from smallpox in Leicester during the epidemic. Louis Pasteur followed in Jenne r ' s footsteps with the development of a vaccine for chicken cholera (which didn' t work) and for anthrax (which was forced on many farmers, who r eported that their sheep died an yway3) and finally , in 1855, for rabies (also called hydrophobia). The premise was that if yo u co uld create a less virulent source of disease and inoculate that into a healthy person, the person woul d develop immunity and not get sick when he encountered the full-blown illness. Even in Pasteur ' s day , physicians doubted that hydrophobia was a specific disease; dogs became v icious through starvation and neglect; and neurological dis ease leading to insanity could happen in the a ftermath of any kind of wound, especially a puncture wound. The most likely cause of rabies is a fo rm of tetanus or botulism\u2014both are associated with clostridium toxins that the bacteria produce under anerobic conditions, as in puncture wound s. Doctors in P asteur ' s day had excellent results treating dog bites by ca uterizing them with carbolic acid. One doctor reported cauterization o f about four hundred dog bite victims w ithout one developing a case of hydrophobia.4 But Pas teur believed that he c ould prevent rabies by vaccinating the victims of dog bites. He created the rabies vaccine by taking saliva, blood, and part of the brain or spinal c ord (usually the cerebrospinal fluid) from a suspected anima l and injecting i t into a living rabbit, then aging and drying the c ells from the rabbit' s spinal cord so that it could be injected into human beings. His first patient, a badly bitten nine-year -old boy , received the vaccine \u2014 after a doctor had cauterized the wound \u2014and recovered. Pasteur proclaimed his success\u2014but others were not so lucky . A Dr . Charles Bell T aylor , w riting i n a publication called National Review in July 1890, listed many ca ses in which Pasteur ' s patients died, whereas the do gs that had bitten th em rem ained healthy .5 One of these cases was King Alexander of Greece. In his own reports, Pasteur fudged the numbers to make it seem as though he had a high rate of success.6 In the practice of medicine, sometimes the dogma about a certain subject b ecomes so rigid that e ven when the truth is sitting in plain sight, physicians simply can' t see it. Such is the case when it comes to the concept of \"p ermanent\" immunity to inf ectious disease. Medical student s are taught early in their tr aining that our immune systems are or ganized around the principle that if we get an infectious disease once, we will never get it again. T his is supposedly due to the two phases of our imm une system working together to create memory of a virus or bacteria that lasts for life. Scientists have worked out the intimate details of this immune memory over the last century in order to provide the theoretical basis for vaccines. The immune theory also derives fro m the simple observation that n obody gets the typical childhood diseases twice in their lives. Like many ideas in medicine, however , the truth may be far more complicated. T wo sim ple observations cast doubt on the premise of immunity for life. The firs t is that certain bacterial diseases, such as strep throat, do tend to recur; in fact, there is no immunity-for -life construct when it comes to bacterial infectio ns. As for viral infections, we can easily observ e that most people get numerous colds and flu throughout their lifetimes. Scientists usually e xplain t his by saying th ese are just dif ferent \"viruses\" one catches, and just because you are immun e to one, doesn' t confer immun ity to other viruses. W e also know and generally accept the fact that a child who gets chicken pox is s usceptible later in life to a second manifestation of chicken pox called shingles . Shi ngles is beli eved to be caused by the same virus, but with a dif ferent symptom pictur e. Similarly , many people have experienced repeated bouts of cold sores or \"herpes\" outbreaks. So, there is no lifelong immunity in these cases. Interestingly , at the time that P asteur and others were formulating the germ the ory of disease, along with its corollary of immunity for life, many scientists and physicians disagreed. One of the dissenters was Professor Alfred Russel W allace. In his book The W onderful Century , he had the following to say about smallpox: V ery few people suf fe r from any special accident twice\u2014a shipwreck, or railway or coach accident, or a house on fire: yet one of these accidents does not confer immunity against it happening a second time. The taking it fo r granted that second attacks of smallpox, or of any other zymotic disease, are of that d egree of rarity as to prove some immun ity or protection, indicates the incapacity for dealing with what is a purely statistical question. W allace describes a study by Dr . Adolf V ogt, professor of Hygiene and Sanitary Statisti the Univer sity of Berne, Switzerland. V ogt compileddata on those who had con tracted smallpox and their subsequent susceptibility to further smallpox episodes. He found that those who had one epis ode of smallpox were actually 63 percent more likely to suf fer from a second episode as compared with those who had never ha d a case of smallpox. V ogt concluded: \"All this justifies our maintaining that the theory of immu nity by a previous attack of smallpox, whether the natural disease or the disease produced artific ially , must be relegated to the realm of fiction.\" W allace went on to prove tha t people vaccinated against smallpox actually had a m uch higher death rate from smallpox than did those who were not vaccinated. In particula r , W allace studied the high death rate from smallpox of the heavily vaccin ated soldiers in the US militar y compared with the results o btained from the sanitation methods employed by the town on Leicester in England. Here is what W allace concluded: It is thus c ompletely demonstrated that a ll the statements by which the public has been gulled for so many years as to the almost c omplete immunity of the revaccinated Arm y and Navy are absolutely false. It is all what the Americans call \"bluf f.\" There is no imm unity . They have no protection. When exposed to infection they do suf fer just as much as other populations or even more. In the whole of the nineteen years 1878-1896 inclusive, unvaccinated Leiceste r had so few smallpox deaths that the Registrar -General presents the average by the decimal 0.01 per thousand population equal to t en per million, wher eas during 187 6-1889, there was less than one death per annum. Here we have real imm unity , real protection; and it is obtained by attending to sanitation and isolation, coupled with the almost tota l neglect of vaccination. Neithe r Army nor Navy can show any such results as this.7 Clearly , protecti on through vaccination for diseases like smallpox is an ugly superstitio n that must be discarded. At the same time , we must abandon the concept of lifelong immunity conferred by the activity of our immune system. But what about the observatio n that children essentially never get measles twice in their lives? In this case, there is so little actual study of this phenomenon tha t it is dif ficult to make any firm conclusions. But we must remember that the typical childhood diseases such as measles, mumps, whooping cough, and chicken pox are best understood as processes of normal g rowth and maturation for the child. If this is the case, there would be n o re ason for children to go through these processes more t han once in their live s. After all, a tadpole transforms into a frog only once; a caterpillar becomes a butterfly only once. Measles is a process of detoxification, transformation, and growth. If thwarted, partic ularly by an injection that clearly alters our \"immune\" responses, then only worse thin gs can happen. This is clearly revealed by the m any studies showing that children who go through typical childhood illnesses such as measles have fe wer chronic diseases throughout the course of their lives. The body likely makes a chemical or protein that we call an antibody to mark this event. B ut it is far from clear that an tibodies are protective of anything, or that th ese childhood diseases are contagious. W e must have the courage and insight to rethink this whole concept of disease. For the pharmaceutical companies, however , the concept of introducing a s mall amount of a bacteria, vir us, or toxin into the body to create lifelong immunity supports the practice of vaccination, and by the early twentieth century , they were having a field day producing vaccines for any disease they could think of. American soldiers made convenient Guin ea pigs and complained in letters home of receiving a vaccination every week. Many have surmised that the ef fects of the Spanish flu were exacerbated on military bases by all these vacc inations inflicted on the troops, including a crude bacterial meningitis vaccination experiment.8 (Another factor that resulted in the high death toll among American soldiers was the use of aspirin, often in huge doses, which undoubtedly contributed to the excessive hemorrhaging that carried so many away .) The pro cess for creating modern vaccines involves many trade secrets and num erous in gredients. Unk nown to the public is ongoing controversy over which process produces th e best and safest results\u2014because serious reactions to vaccinations are commonplace. When one understands the basics of how all modern viral vaccines are manufactured, however , it becomes immediately clear not only how fraudulent the whole process is but a lso how the production of m odern viral vaccines helps prove that these viruses can' t possibly be causing the diseases for which they are blamed. T o p roduce a m odern vaccine, technicians first collect biological fluids from an infected person, usually respiratory secretions or the fluid from skin lesions. This presumably contains millions of copies of the virus\u2014 along with an un told number of components from cellular debri s. The fluid is then centrifuged to concentrate the virus. The next step is to inoculate this centrifuged fluid onto a variety of tissue cultures, usually tissue derived from monkey kidney cells, aborted human fetal tissue, or chicken eggs. Some companies have proposed using cancer tissue as a culture, due to the fact that cancerous tissue is \"easier to grow in lar ge amounts,\" but this practice is still considered too risky . It tu rns out the viruses that su pposedly will kill us all aren' t strong enough to infect the tissue cultu res. This means in order to help the virus taken from the sick patient lyse (kill) the tissue cells, they have to starve and poison the tissue first. Once the tissue is weak enough, the virus can then infect the cells, inject its genetic material into the cells, and produce millions of copies of itself. That' s the theory , anyway . The resultant infected tissue is an unholy mixture of the original snot (now frozen and distributed across the globe to all the various vaccine manufacturing companies as their \"stock\" material), the toxins (antibiotics, oxidizing agent s, etc.) used to weaken the tissue, the debris from the breakdown of the tissue, and th e \"viruses\" that emer ge from this process. There ar e often some light purification steps added at this point, but never anything even remotely approaching isolation and purification of the viruses. Then finally , some preservatives (usually mercury for multi-dose vials, still used for the flu vaccine) and stabilizers (such as polysorbate 80,an emul sifier that breaks down the blood-brain barrier) are ad ded to this final product. This is a live viral vaccine. A \"dead \" or attenuated viral vac cine is all of the above steps an d then a final hea t or chemical sterilizatio n step at the end to \"kill\" or at least neuter the virus. Never mind that one can' t say viruses are even alive in any meaningful sens e of that word, nevertheless, they are \"killed,\" u sually with heat, in this step. Then an adjuv ant, usually aluminum, is added to the final product to make sure that the person receiving the mixture attempts to eliminate it from the body and so produce antibodies, consider ed proof of an immune response that will protect against the disease. Another way to make an attenuated or inactive viral vaccine is to start with dea d, killed tissue. Then technicians isolate single protein particles from the dead tissue, Somet imes they even produce these particles synthetically . After that they add adjuvants and preservatives, including aluminum. Aluminum added to the rest of these toxic chemicals is the likely culprit for the creation of the excessive inflammatory reactions that frequently occu r with any attenuated viral vaccine\u2014and are one of the central hallmark s of the Covid-19 syndrome. It would certainly be an interesting research project for someone to track the relationship between prior vaccine usage and subsequent development of Covid-19 symptoms in adults and children. The message that Americans get every morning in the newspapers and every ev ening o n the news is that a Covid-19 vaccine will save us\u2014 with mandatory vaccines for everyone, we can go back to life as normal, and scientists will have saved the day . The vac cine would be liability-free and rushed to market, making its debut in January 2021. Liabil ity-free means that the consumer has no redress, no matter how bad the injury to himself or his child, no matter how costly the care after the injury ; and it means that vaccine ma nufacturershave absolutely no incentive to make a vaccine that is eit her safe or ef fective. Even if a virus is the cause of C ovid-19, manufacturers face a number of obstacles. For one, the virus already \"has mutated into at least thirty dif ferent genetic variants.\"9 T he variants inc lude nineteen never seen before as w ell as \"rare changes that scientists had never imagined cou ld happen.\" In additi on, the challenge of pro ducing so many vaccines in so short a time is daunting. As described in an article publis hed by Children' s Health Defense,10 the solution proposed by pharmace utical companies is a new type of vaccine that can \"outsma rt\" nature using next-generation vaccine technologies such as gene transfer and self-assembling nanoparticles\u2014 along with invasive new vaccine delivery and reco rd-keeping mechanisms like smartphone- readable quantum dot tattoos\u2014 which will require the vast capacity of 5G networks to read and process. T o quickly produce a vaccine for the whole world, they will also need to develop new manufacturing techniques that circumvent the slow processes of traditional vaccine production. The new techniques use genetic engineering (re combinant DN A technology) subjected to \"expression systems\" (bacteria, yeast, insect cells, mammalian cells, or plants such as tobacco)\u2014to p roduce so-calle d \"subunit vaccines.\" The problematic hepatitis B vaccine was the first to employ this entirely new vaccine production approach, and a number of the Covid-19 vaccines currently under developm ent are deploying these techniques. Howev er , subunit vaccines must be bundled with \"immune-potentiating\" adjuvants (most likely aluminum) that can trigger an inflammatory immune response. Even ne wer are DNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, which are basic ally a form of gene therapy . Whereas traditional vaccin es introduce a vaccine antigen to produce an immune response (which doesn' t actually mean that the re cipient is immune), nucleic acid vaccines inste ad send the body instruction s to produce the antigen itself. As one research er explains, the n ucleic acids \"cause the cel ls to make pieces of the virus,\" so that the immune system then \"mounts a response to those pieces of the virus.\" DNA v accines are intended to penetrate all the way into a cell' s nucleus. Accord ing to one biotech scientist, \"This is an incredi bly dif ficult task giv en that our nuclei have evolved to prevent any foreign DNA from entering.\"1 1 Ma ybe nature has a reason f or protecting the nucleus from genetic invasion! When so me DN A vaccines made it into clinical trials in the late 2000s, they were plagued by \"subopti mal potency ,\" meaning they didn' t work. Scientists then came up with the idea of augmenting vaccine delivery with \"electroporation\"\u2014electric shocks applied to the vaccine site (using a smart device) to make cell membranes more permeable and force th e DNA into the cells . Electroporation remai ns a key design feature of some Covid-19 vaccine candidates today . A secon d aspec t of DNA vaccines\u2014their gene-altering proper ties\u2014is also troubling. DNA vaccines, by definition, come with the risk of \"integration of exogenous DNA into the host genome, which may cause severe mutagenesis and induced new diseases.\" Framed in more understandable terms, \"disruption from DNA is like inserting a foreign ingredient in an existing recipe, which can change the resulting dish.\" The permanent incorporation of synthetic genes into the recipient' s DNA essentially produces a genetically modified human being, with unknown long-term ef fects. Regarding DNA gene therapy , one researcher has stated, \"Genetic integrations usin g viral gene therapies . . have a devastating ef fect if the integ ration w as placed in th e wrong spot in [the] genome.\" Discussing DNA vaccines specifically , the Harvar d College Global Health Review notes tha t the DNA vaccines cou ld cause chronic inflammation, because the vaccine continuously stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies. Other concerns include the possible integration of foreign DNA into the body' s host genome, resulting in mutations, problems with DNA replication, autoimmune responses and activation of cancer -ca using genes \u2014think children with birth defects and cancer early in life. The mRNA vaccines are \"particularly suited to speedy development\" and have attracted attention as the \"coronavirus frontrunners.\" mRNA vaccines can reportedly generate savings of \"months or years to standardize and ramp up . . . mass product ion.\" mRNA vaccines need reach only the cell cytoplasm rather than the nucleus\u2014an apparently \"simpler technical challenge\"\u2014although the approach still demands \"delivery technologies that can ensure stabilization of mRNA under physiological conditions.\" This involves \"chemical modifi the liquid nanoparticles to \"package it into an injectable form.\" Unfortunately fo r the pharmaceutical companies, mRNA vaccines have displayed an \"intrinsic\" inflammatory component that makes it dif ficult to establish an \"acceptable risk/benefit profile.\" mRNA enthusiasts admit that there is, as yet , an inadequate understanding of the inflammation and autoimmune rea ctions that may result from the vaccine. This raises the specter of a tru e disaster should regulators grant the manufacturers of Covid-19 mRNA vaccines their wish for \"a fast-track process to get mRNA vaccines to people sooner .\" A good example of a rushe d vaccine was the dengue vaccine experiment\u2014which actually increased the risks of dengue fever:12 Dengue fever is a common disease in mo re than 120 countries and, like coronavirus, has been the tar get for a vaccine for many years. The development and licensure of Dengvaxia\u00ae vaccine by Sanofi spanned more than twenty years and cost more than 1.5 billion US doll ars. But the developmen t of the vaccine turned out to be dif ficult. Dengue vaccine antibodies often made the infection worse\u2014called \"disease enhancement\" in vaccine-speak\u2014 especially in infants and children. When the vaccine was administered to thousands of children in the P hilippines, at least six hundred died. The Philippine government has permanently banned the vaccine from the country . Another rushed vaccine, for the swine flu, was a total fiasco. Early in 1976, after several soldiers became severely ill at Fort Dix in New Jersey , supposedly from swine flu, President Gerald Ford announced a plan to rush through a vaccine so that ev ery American could be vaccinated. But manufacturers balked at the specter of liability for vaccine injuries and one company produ ced two million doses with the \"wrong strain .\" Congress passed a law waiving liability , and Ford pushed plans to inoculate one million p eople p er day by the fall, even though reports seeped through that the v accine had caused injuries and was not ef fective. In mid-October , Ford went on television to show himself receiving an injection fro m a White House doctor . Meanwhile, the c apricious swine flu failed to appear and in December , following ninety-four reports of paralysis from the vaccination, the program was terminated, an d the danger of swine flu disappeared from the pages of the newspapers.13 So far , trials for the coronavirus vaccine have not gone well. O n May 18, 2 020, Moderna Inc. (co-ow ned by the National Institutes o f Health14), headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, announced that it had obtained \"positive interim clinical data\" from a Phase I clinical trial for an mRNA Covid vaccine. Moderna stock soared (and their top executives sold of f over one hun dred mil lion dollars' worth of shares).15 However , four o f the forty- five participants suf fered serious reactions. The three subjects who received the highest doses all experienced grade-three systemic symptoms, which can mean blistering open ulcer s, wet peeling, or serious rash over lar ge areas of the bod y . The press release did not mention the results of other trials.16 One volunteer , Ian Haydon, age twenty-nine, vac cine left him \"the sickest he' s ever been .\" He was rushed to ur gent care, where he almost fainted. But Haydon is still cautiously optimistic about a vaccine.17 The New Y ork T imes rep orted positive results from a vaccine in development by the University o f Oxford. \"Monkeys given an e xperimental vaccine from the University of Oxford appear to have resisted the novel coronavirus. Six rhesus macaques given hAdOx1 nCoV -19 in Montana did not fall ill despite heavy exposure,\" was the headline.18 But they did fall ill, in fa ct, all the vaccinated macaques sickened after exposure to Covid-19, \"suggesting the treatment, whic h has already received in the region of \u00a390 million in government investment, may not halt the spread of the deadly disease.\"19 An experimental vaccine for Covid-19 that uses human fetal cell lines, in de velopment by CanSino Biologics, Inc. of T ianjin, China, al so had poor results. In a clinical trial involving 108 volunteers, ranging i n age from forty-five to sixty years old, 81 percent suf fered at least one adverse reaction within seven days after vaccination. Adverse ef fects included fever , fatigue, headache, and muscle pain, some of it severe.20 Following these disappointing results, the FDA relaxed the rules. On June 30, the agency announced that any Covid-19 vaccine wo uld have to prevent disease, or decrease its severity , in only 50 percent of the people who receive it.21 The Am erican College of Obste tricians and Gynecologists (AGOC) has suggested testing Covid-19 experimental vaccines on pregnant women.22 A nd, the of fici als tell us, the vaccine might be needed multiple times, perhaps annually .23 It' s clear that a vaccine is not going to save us\u2014in fact it has the potential of inflicting enormous suf fering on the world' s population, not to mention violent resistance to the idea of universal gene modification by electroporation. And all for an illness that is not contagious! Only tw o things are going to resolve the coronavirus problem. O ne is a new sys tem of etiquette. Just a few decades ago, few people gave much thought about smoking in som eone else' s house; today such an action is considered the height of rudenes s. T oday , no one with any sense would light up i n front of another person without asking permission, and certainly would not smoke in another per son' s dwelling place. T oday we are shocked to se e m en and women smoking in old movies\u2014we all know that tobacco companies paid producers to show glamorous people smoking cigarettes, and we shake our heads in disgust. In the future, w e will feel the same disgust when we see peop le in the movies hold cell phones to their ears. How could filmmakers encourage such a dangerous practice! Like the warnings on cigarette pac kages, there will be warnings on cell phones against use by children; sales of cell phones to y oung people will be forbidden. And no one will dream of entering another person' s home with their cell phones on. Public pressure will ensure that all lar ge gatherings\u2014sports events, concerts, fairs, conventions, choir practice, dress rehearsals, church services, and private parties\u2014begin with admonitions to turn cell phones to airplane mode. High sc hools w ill not allow ce ll phones on campus an d all computer input for childre n will be in wires. Of fices will designate sp ecial areas for cell phone use, in deference to the electrically sensitive, like special areas for smoking, and give all employees old-fashioned telephones. The second task involves a m assive cleanup. Just as the In dustrial Revolution crea ted unsanitary conditions that took decades of patient hard work (as well as new technologies) to amend, the wireless revolution will require the same patient remediation\u2014mainly by putting as much communication as possible into wires, but also by exploring new technologies for mitigating EMFs in the home and of fice. New houses will be built with minimizing EMF exposure in mind, and old houses will be upgraded\u2014just as old houses eventually got bathrooms and central heating. These measures are not as glamorous as introducing a vaccine that will bring fame and fortune to a few , but they are the only real solution to the electro-smog pollution of the Internet age.And there is some good news. For years the telecommunications companies have collected fees f rom your phone bill in order to bring high- speed fiber optics to every hom e, school, and business in Am erica\u2014fees amounting to more than five th ousand dollars per household and totaling billions of dollars. But instead of putting fiber optics everywhere\u2014 the job is on ly about 50 percent compl ete\u2014these companies invested this money illegally to force people into w ireless plans. Accounting tricks have made fiber optics services appear unprofitable while wireless seemed extremely profitable. The telecommunica tions companies, in collusion with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), have used these distorted financial results to ar gue that they cannot bring wired Internet to rural areas or ev en inner cit ies. More important, these accounting tricks have provided an e xcuse to sh ut of f the wired networks and go wireless with 5G. Some telecommunications executives have even proposed getting rid of old- fashioned telephone service. Fortunately\u2014most fortunately\u2014a recent court case IRREGULA T ORS v . FCC : DC Court of Appeals Opinion , M arch 13, 20 20, removes FCC jurisdiction and returns it to sta te regulatory agencies. All illegal subsidies for wireless can now be stopped\u2014and 5G is no longer profitable.24 CHAPTER 14 5 G A N D T H E F U T U R E O F H U M A N I T Y \"What a piece of work is man!\" In Hamlet' s famous soliloquy , Shakespeare poses questions about the nature of the human being. One of history' s greatest initiates and thinkers, Shakespeare describes the human being as the crowning achievement of creation, free and unlimited i n potential. Humankind is noble, created in the image of the Godhead itself, yet subject to a ll the foibl es, temptations , and errors with which we are all well acquainted. The que stion fo r this chapter , having previously explored the watery nature of life itself, is what or who is this human being? The corollary to the question, one that is rarely asked, is why we should even care whether human b eings w ill survive this c urrent pandemic or whether we are about to go extin ct, as have so many fe llow animal species? In some ways, if we can' t be gin to answer this s imple but profound question, then what dif ference does it make whether or not there are pathogenic viruses creating contagions? T o answer this question\u2014what is a human being?\u2014is actually the key to bring ing the Covid-19 phenomenon to a successful resolution; it is the key to the challenge of bu ilding a world we all know is p ossible, but may be too afraid to pursue or even demand.When one tries to pinpoint the unique characteristics of human beings, many answers come forward. Some will say that this is a stupid or unanswerable question. Others might suggest that human being s are \"apes without hair ,\" \"the only upright animal,\" or \"the animal with the lar gest brain.\" The scientist might point to our unique genetic makeup, the only living being with this particular set of forty-six chromosomes. A religious person m ight say that human beings are created in the image of God and as such are given dominion over the earth. The technologist might deny anything particularly special about human beings a nd poin t out our many design flaws, which he believ es could be improved or upgraded by mer ging human beings with computers, creating a kind of downloa d for our mind s. Unfortunately for them\u2014for tunately for human beings\u2014the technocrats have been unable to locate the human mind. These v arious descriptions all have certain elements of truth in them\u2014 well, ma ybe not the downloaded mind theory\u2014but they all miss one simple and clear distinction, one that is unar guable and scientifically irrefutable. It is the one that holds the key to understanding Covid-19. The dif ference between the human being and all the rest of the animals is si mple: the human being is the only li ving being tha t can bear child ren at every si ngle tim e of the year . All other animals go into heat, and become fertile only at specific times of the year , usually so they give birth in the spring\u2014wild an imals go into heat once a year and domestic animals (dogs, pigs, cows, etc.) typically twice a year , and a few (cats and rabbits) several times per year . B ut human beings, at least at this point in our evolution, are able to conceive at any time of the year . People on earth are conceived every single day of the year an d people are born every single day of the year . No animal can do this. What is the significance of this obvious fact? As we have disc ussed in chapter 7 , all mat ter is simply the congruence of wide and varied \"forces,\" or \"ener gies,\" which make up our entire universe, received or collected through the universal receptor we call water . The recognition of these universal ener gies or forces was the basis of all traditional wisdom and healing systems until the current materialistic medical model came to the fore, and under which we all now labor . T raditional heale rs recognized the influence of the stars and pla nets; for example, they characterized chamomile as a \"V enus\" plant, stinging nettles as a \"Mars\" plant, and dandelion as a \"Jupiter\" plant. Now that we understand the electromagnetic nature of the unive rse, these characterizations begin to make sense. This foundational understanding was the basis of most human knowledge until it was lost in re cent times. Although this way of looking at the world is key to our development as individuals, it needs to be rediscovered because the deployment of 5G technology threatens the foundation of existence, and we can understand why this is so only if we recapture the ancient way of thinking about life. Unlike animals, the human bei ng is not conceived or born under the influence of any specific cosmic ener gy field. Instead, each human being is conceived and born at a unique time and place, therefore under the influence of a unique cosmic field. This is the physiological basis of our freedom and individuality . This is what makes the human being the crown of cr eation; this is the basis for the claim that the human being is created in the i mage of Go d, God being a concept embracing the ener getic field of the entire un iverse. Each individual human being is a unique component in this field, and humanity as a whole is the sum of the entire field and therefore the image or the reflection of God. This is the essential message of all major philosophical and religious traditions from the past. These cosmic fields in the fo rm of electromagnetic forces radiate toward the earth from all parts of the cosmos and are \"collected\" in the ionosphere or electromagnetic shield of the earth. In a way sim ilar to how we obtain nourishment from o ur food, these electromagnetic forces are \"processed\" by this protective skin of the earth, the ionosphere. When wetake in food, the food is process ed by the bacteria, fungi, viruses, and other microbes in our gut; their \"waste\" then becomes the nourishi ng food we absorb t o give us life. Similarl y , the cosmic forces are worke d on in our ionosphere, to emer ge as the lif e-giving electromagnetic fields that nourish the earth and all life, includin g human life. That is how it has always worked and how it should work\u2014and it would except for the introduction of the technology we call 5G. W ithout getting too deep into the engineering of 5G technology , the important thing about 5G is that the pulsed millimeter wave s, this new \"spectrum\" that will run our phones and computers faster , need to be \"or ganized\" by placing hundreds of thousands of satellites right into the ionosphere of the earth. These hundreds of thousands of satellit es will emit their own electromagnetic frequencies that essentially beam these new , man-made signals down to the millions of receivers placed in our neighborhoods, stadiums, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, p arks, farms, lakes, forests, oceans, and ever ywhere else on earth. The intention is to blanket the earth with these m anmade electromagnetic fields.1 W e know that thes e millim eter waves interfere with the availability of oxygen in the atmosphere and hence will also interfere with the ability of the mitochondria (b acteria) in our ti ssues to convert oxygen into ener gy . This is the main feature of 5G, exacer bated by aluminum poisoning, glyphosate poisoning, gene ral air pollution, and all the many other toxins in our modern world\u2014all contributing to the symptoms of \"Covid-19.\" But non e of this can match the consequences of putting hund reds of thousands of satellites into the i onosphere of the earth. If this is allowed to happen, not only will all life on earth be subject to the constant toxic ef fect of these harmful millimeter waves, as if that isn' t bad enough, but the direct consequence of this folly is that the cosmic waves that come to us from the furthest reaches of our cosmos will no longer be allowed to m aintain their integrity in their journey to the earth. Life will be cut of f from the cosmos, elk will no long er be elk, squirrels will have lost the ener getic source that makes th em squ irrels, and human beings will no longer be formed as free individuals with their own unique destinies. Life will become formed under the influence of computer code written by the self-styled new \"masters of our universe.\" And, all this so w e can have faster download spe eds for our cell phones. Humanity is at a crossroads, a nd although we can present m itigation strategies that transform the ener gy fields that constitute 5G tech nology (see Appendix B), we should be clear . \"Covid-19\" is the first wave of diseasecreated by the introduction of this new technology . It is only the tip of the iceber g. Of ficial s warn us that more waves are coming. They know . They are replacing the wisdom of G od with the folly of man. It' s time for humanity to wake up, grow up, and to find the courage to stop this menace.E P I L O G U E Once upon a ti me, in a far -of f place, lived a king and a queen. Their kingdom was happy , prosperous, and peaceful. Unfortunately , the royal couple was barren, and the peop le were worried that they would be left with no suitable heir to the throne. One day , the king and queen were walking in the forest and they came upon a pond. Out of the pond jumped a frog who informed them that they would soon have a beautiful da ughter . Naturally , this news filled them and the entire kingdom with joy . T o celeb rate the arrival of their daughter the royal family invited the twelve w ise women of the kingd om to a feast at the palace. Aft er the feast, each of the wise women spoke up and conferred a blessing on the new child. One gave the blessing of beauty , another gave the blessing of kindness, anothe r of wisdom, and so on to include all the good qualities that ennoble the human being. After the eleventh wise woman had spoken, an uninvited woma n burst into the palace banquet hall. She was also an elder woman, but unlike the others sh e had evil intentions. She was a witch, and she was angry that she had not b een invited to the banquet to honor the new child.Out of her fury , she pronounced a terrible curse on the child, saying that as the child grew into adulthoo d, she would prick her finger on a spindle and fall down dead. The people in the hall were stunned an d shocked. Thankfully , the twelfth wise woman had not yet spoken. Upon hearing this curse, sh e annou nced that the ev il woman was powerful, and therefore she could not completely undo this curse, but she could change it. Instead of falling down dead, the young g irl, if she pricked her finger on a spindle, would only go to sleep, not die. After the banque t, the king orde red the destruction of all the spindles in the king dom. There would be no possibility that the princess could ever prick her finger on a spindle. As t ime went on , the princess gr ew into a beautiful young wom an, with all the wonderful traits bestowed upon her by the wise women. She was kind, beautiful, and wise, and the entire kingdom prospered. One day the king and queen left the palace for a state outing. As usual, the princess was left in the char ge of state of ficials, whose orders were to keep a close eye on her . Everyon e loved the princess, and being of a curious nature sh e convi nced the of ficials to let her wander freely in the castle. She came upon a ro om she had never seen before. Inside was an old woman sitting on a stoo l spinning wool. Curious, having never seen anyone spin wool before, she asked the old woman what she was doing. The old woman handed her the spindle; the princess pricked he r finger and as predicted fell into a deep sleep. When the king and queen returned to the castle, they put her in a beautiful bed. Then everyone else in the kingdom fell asleep as well. The bread was still in the oven, the shoemaker ' s leather still on the bench, the shepherds' flocks were still in the fields. The entire kingdom fell under the influence of an evil spell. As t ime went o n, the castle bec ame engulfed in a mass of thorns and vines. Anyone visiting the kin gdom from another land was unable topenetrate the deep thicket of toxic thorns. Those who tried were met with certain death. So it was for one hundred years. One day , a young prince from a far -of f land was out hunting an d came upon the over grown castle. An old man told him about the plight of the beautiful young princess inside. Something moved him deeply; he knew he could and must save the princess and the kingdom. He announced his intentions to his mother and fa ther , the king and queen, and to the entire court. They forbade him to und ertake this quest, knowing he would meet certain death. He resp onded simply , \"I am n ot afraid, I will rescue the beautiful princess.\" And, so it came to pass. W ithou t any fear in his heart the thorns had no power o ver the prince; as he app roached the castle, they parted before him. He foun d the princess lying on her bed; he was astonished by her radiant beauty . He knelt and kissed her . The princess awoke, and with her the entire kingdom; everyone simply resumed their business. The prince and princess were ma rried, the kingdom was restored to health, prosperity and peace, and they all lived happily ever after . Most of you will recognize this story of Sleeping Beauty or Bri ar Rose. It is a story told to children all over the world for centuries, to impress on their sou ls the ways of the wor ld and to give them courage. It is also the story of \"Covid-19\" if we know how to properly unravel its metaphors. The wor ld was peaceful and prosperous but it was clear that w ithout a true heir\u2014without a true direction\u2014the world would not be able to go on as it was. Then, as if out of nowh ere, a lowly frog\u2014a representation of the spiritual world in fairy tales\u2014i nforms the king and queen tha t there is a road to continued prosperity an d fruitfulness of the land\u2014a pr incess shall be born. Overjoyed, the royal couple invite the twelve wise women to celebrate this news. The twelve wise women represent the collected wisdom of t he universe. They are the zodiac, the cycle of the year , and theconnection betw een the cosmos (the entire zodiac) and the earth (the cycle of the year). But there is a thirteenth woman , the evil witch. W itches are typically depicted in fairy tales as having distorted, twisted bodies, yellow eyes, and sallow skin. They are the picture of illness, the incarnat ion of the materialistic vie w of life. They are fallen matter , hence some sort of crone, stepmother , or weak mother figu re. The wise women are the spiritual view of life, the witches or fallen women are the materialistic view of life. The twe lfth wise woman cannot undo the power of the witch' s curse, it is to o powerful; in fact, the curse is something the kingdo m must go through to achieve health, pros perity , and peace on a higher and lasting level. She can, however , mitigate its power . And so it is. The entire world goes into lockdown. Anyone try ing to rescue the world, anyone who points out that life doesn' t have to be l ike this, is torn asunder by the toxic thorns that engulf the kingdom. The en tire world is cursed, living as if in a dream or sp ell, the curse of materialism in all its guises, for the prom ise of faster video games. Just like us. But there is a way out, a way discovered by the prince from a far -of f land. He expresses this clearly: \"I am not afraid.\" W ithout fear , guided by love, the curse can be broken. T he world can be restored, the lesson can be learned, materialism, currently in the form of a toxic virus theory and enthrallment to the Internet, ca n be overcome. W e can do this, it' s just a spell, it' s not real, it' s make-bel ieve. All we have to do is find courage and love in our hearts to embrace the truth. That is all that matters.APPENDIX A W A T E R As d escribed in chapter 8 , w ater that hea ls, the kind of water that the healthiest human cultures have all consumed, shares a number of specific characteristics. T o reiterate, healthy water is free of all to xins, it contains the full complement of minerals, and it is structured through subjection to a constant vortex motion. As a result of this constant vortex motion, the water is oxyge nated. The oxygenation step is crucial in producing healing waters, and is a characteristic of the most renowned healing waters on the planet, like the water at Lourdes and in the Ganges River . Finally , t he water is \"finished\" through its exposure to nature sounds and frequencies all along its path. When these steps are followed, we have a healing water that is one of the core found ations of health for plants, animals, and humans. Providing healing, healthy water like this should be a basic requiremen t for every hospital, hospice, and healing institution. Interestingly , in addition to the water we drink, it is clear fro m both historical eviden ce and modern research that the water we was h and bathe in is at least as important as the water we drink. This point was brought home to us as a result of persona l experience and looking at the research on the O phora water systems. Oph ora is an innovative water comp any located in Southern California, which has developed a technique for taking any municipal or well water and cleansing it of all traces of toxins, pharmaceuticals, fluoride, chlorine, and even microplastics. As far as we know , no other system is able to purify water to this level. Then the water is re-mineralized by adding all the known minerals found in seawater . After that, the water is put through a rose quartz vortex and oxygenated to forty parts pe r million with a proprie tary technology . This is by far the highest oxygen content of any water te sted, on a level with the rarest and finest healing waters on earth. The water is pH balanced and finished by exposing the water to the sounds of nature. Studies of people who soak in this oxygenated water and drink one-half gallon p er day show some amazing results. First, the oxygen saturation of the tissu es immediately goes up and stays at the highest levels for up to twelve hours. This is a more robust oxygen saturation response than one gets wit h hyperbaric oxygen therapy , a strategy known to produce many therapeutic ef fects. Second, and even more astonishingly , the phase angle (PhA) measurement of the tissues also rises.1 T he phase angl e measurement tells us a bout the level of hydration of the tissues and is actually an indication of the subject' s biological age.2 PhA is a direct measurement of your cell membrane integrity .3 The me mbrane is what structures the water inside and outside of your cells. The mem brane is where the cells communicate with one another and where an electrical char ge is created so the cell can function. (See chapter 9 for a discussio n of the appropriate diet for cell membrane integrity .) The phase angle measurement goes up within hours of a one-hour soak in a bath of oxy genated, purified water along with drinking one-half gallon of the water over the course of a day . Furthermore, this improvement in the phase angle, a p rocess that usually takes months of detoxificat ion and the cleanest of diets, seems to last f or some time, after even just one session of soaking and hydration. One can only guess at the improvem ent in the quality of hydration and the bio logical age of the person if this became a weekly or daily practice. Imagine the results that hospitals woul d achieve if they beg an treatment with oxygenated drinking and bathing water , rather than putting patients on ventilators! For purity and oxygenation levels, the Ophora water system is currently the only system that we can recommend for creating therapeutic waters. This presents a dilemma as m ost readers will find purchasing either an Ophora system for home use or actually purchasing the water d irectly from Ophora ( Ophorawater .com ) to be cost prohibitive. Clearly the best solution would be for ev ery town and municipality to use multiple Op hora water systems to produce healthy water for its citizens. The Ophora owners are ready and prepared to help with this project. For pers onal showering and bathing, the simplest options are either an Ophora shower device, which e liminates some toxins from the water while oxygenating and structuring it, in conjunction with some kind of filter or reverse osmosis system in your house. Another possibility is an Aquadea showerhead atta chment for your shower or bathtub. The Aquadea system puts the incoming water through a high-speed implosion vortex so that it essentially sucks the water out of the pipe rather than pushing it as is otherwise the case. (This is exactly how the heart helps move the blood, through suction rather than \"pushing.\"4) The suct ion is easily confirmed by putting one' s hand over the water as it emer g es from the showerhead. Rather than your hand being pushed, you will feel your hand sucked up against the showerhead. The vortex created by the arrangem ent of crystals inside the showerhead creates ef ener gy and life. An i nteresting experiment is to w ater one group of plants with Aquadea water and the second group with normal water . Showerin g under an Aquadea showe rhead is like tak ing a shower under a waterfall and bathing in A quadea water is like bathi ng in a flowing stream\u2014the invigorating ef fects are similar . The Aquadea people can customize the type of crystals they use in pro ducing your showerhead and the materials (usually gold, silver , or bronze) that the showerhead is made of. The drtomcowan.com website is currently the US distr ibutor for Aquadea showerheads. There are a va riety of more af fordable op tions for home filtration systems that could be combined with an Aquadea showerhead. A g ood option for home-delivered water is Mountain V alley Spring ( mountainvalleyspring.com ), which has delivery service nationwide and uses gla ss bottle s only . Castle R ock ( castlerockwatercompany .com ) bottles water in glass and is available in stores nationwide. A simple way to mineralize and oxygenate these recommended waters is to fill an eight-ounce glass, add a pinch of unrefined sea salt, and stir with a long-handled spoon, making a vortex. Stir in one direction and then reverse to stir in the other direction, repeating several times. APPENDIX B B I O - G E O M E T R Y A N D E M F M I T I G A T I O N The interesting and amazing thing about the current state of human awareness is that what we generally call science is actually mostly a series of easily disproven, irrational superstitions. Here is one simple example of such a supersti tion, which once corrected holds the key to protecting ourselves and all of nature from the harmful ef fects of EMFs. Start by asking yourself or your friends the simple question: does the form, shape, and patt ern of some object, and the quality of the materials that make this form, sh ape, or pattern, have an ef fect on the invisible ener gies of living things? Science, at least medicine, is clear that such an idea is unscientific nonsense. If a doctor at a conventional medical conference sug gested that one could lay a geometric form on a human being or place a geometric form near a human being to produce a therapeutic ef fect, he would be a laughingstock. However , consider the Stradivarius violin, widely considered the best violin ever made, some of them selling for tens of millions of dollars. What is this violin? S imply put, it is a specific geometric form made from a specific materia l called moon wood (timber harvested during the w aning moon when the sap in the trees is at its lowest) that some how forms invisible sound waves into unmatched music. The sound this specific form,made with this s pecific material, produces has been prized for centuries by violinists all over the world. A pparently , the form and material of this specific violin is able to shape invisible sound waves to create the most exquisite music. Only a completely unscientific mind would conclude that this is the only example in nature in which form, patterns, and shape made out of a specific material af fects the ener gy that we now know animates life. The reality is that this process of form, shape, pattern, and material af fecting the ener gy around us is the norm and not some unu sual occur - rence. It is the b asis of \"sacred\" science all over the world, even back to the time humans lived in caves and carved geometric forms into the walls of the caves. F rom our earliest days, through the forms of the pyramids, monuments, and sculpture, humans have been working with material and form to create ef fects on the life around them. It is only t he modern, irrational materialistic \"scientists,\" whose ideas are formed primarily by superstition, who deny these ef fects are real. Bio-geometry is simply the science of how form, shape, and patterns combined with certain materials shape the ener gy in the world around us. The resu lt of this shaping is eith er a beneficial or harmful ef fec t on all life forms including human beings. Living in a time of increasing electro- smog, with no apparent end in sight fo r the level of pollution we will be exposed to, i t is imperative that all our readers explore the strategies and techniques of fered b y bio-geometry to mitigate these ef fects. This is not in any way to suggest that putting 5G satellite s and towers up is somehow fine if we just use bio-geometry to mitigate their ef fects\u2014this is not at all true. These insane in stallations must be stopped. At the same time, right now , everyone can and should avail themselves of the science of bio- geometry to deal with the current electromagnetic pollution we all face. No disrespect is meant to the m any companies that are using waves, patterns, forms and other techniq ues to mitigate EMF ef fects. Some of them are h elpful. However , based on s tudies with plants, animals, and humans, aswell as our pers onal experience, the strategies used by bio- geometry stand above all the rest in terms of their safety and ef ficacy . For example, in the late 1990s, the National Liver Disease Research project i n Egypt undertook a stu dy of patients with hepatitis C and elevated liver enzymes. Although most claim that hep C is a viral disease, the elevation of the liver enzymes does not ar gue for the presence of a virus but indicates some toxin that is af fecting the health of the liver . In this study the participants wer e asked to wear either a bio- geometry pendant, use a placebo, or follow conventional antiviral therapy . The researchers followed the c ourse of the liver enzymes in the six months after the intervention. The head of the stud y , Dr . T asha Kha lid, announced on Saudi television that the results showed 90 percent of the participants who used the bio-geometry pendants had a r eduction in liver enzymes in the first six months. This is in contrast to a re duction of 50 percent in those who used c onventional treatment and 20-30 percent of those in the placebo group.1 This is a dramatically positive result for such a simple and inexpensive intervention, and one that should be followed up with other studies on other illnesses. The best way to use bio-geometry is to become a bio-geometry practitioner your self. Y ou can do this by contacting the V esica Institute and signing up for t heir online classes ( vesica.or g ). The next best thing is to contact and work with a trained bio-geometry practitioner who can get you started in mitigating your personal space, including helping you find personal protect ive devices to u se. The final approach, one that is the least everyone should use, is to purchase the L90 and bio-emitter pendants from the vesica.or g website and use them as directed all the time. The vesica.or g website also features the fascinating work of Ibrahim Karim, w ho was able to mitiga te the ef fects of radio antennas in a church steeple in Hember g, Switzerland, using various shapes strategically placed in the church and nearby houses.2 In addition, there are many com monsense precautions that everyone can take. If you use a cell phone, keep it to a minimum and never p ut it to your ear . Hav e a landline in your home for regular telephone use. If possible, use wired Internet, not W i-Fi. At least turn of f your W i-Fi at night. Don' t let your utility company install a s mart meter; there is often a fee to pay for keeping an old-fashioned analog meter , but it is worth it. While yo u sleep, your bedroom should be free of electro-smog. T urn of f the fuses to all wiring in your bedroom at night; you can ev en have an electrician install a switch to do this near your bed. Don' t have an electric alarm cl ock on your nightstand, near your head. Use a batte ry-powered alarm clock instead. A void electric cars, fluorescent and compact lights, \"smart\" appliances, and electric-powered exercise equipment. Above all, spend some time each day outside, far away from antennas\u2014 in a park, on a farm, or in the woods\u2014to give your body the rest it needs from EMF pollution.APPENDIX C W H A T T O E A T ? A healt hy diet, one that help s maintain your cellular gels, gives you maximum ener gy , and protects you as much as possible from EMFs, does not require any renunciation. Y ou don' t have to eat a diet tha t is dry and tasteless, but can enjoy a vari ety of delicious, satisfying food. What is required is an attention to quality and preparation methods. In other words, we have to think carefully about every morsel of food we put in our mouths. In tr aditional cultures, they ate the food they had and knew instinctively how to prepare it; they did not have to think about how to have a healthy diet, it just happened naturally . The mark of modern man is that he is an individual, and he can no longer d epend on his tribe or village to make decisions for him. He is faced with a bewilder ing variety of c hoices, especially in the food he eats. He must wa de through the myriad of ferings of processed food (much of it addictive) and also be wary of misinformation, especially the misinformation coming from the medical establishment; he must avoid falling f or a diet of industrial fo odstuf fs while also steering clear of weird, invented diets and especially low-fat diets that are impossible to follow . In terms of qual ity , avoid industrially farmed food. Someday e veryone will \"have a far m\"\u2014meaning that everyone will know a particular grass- based farmer from whom they purchase their meat, poultry , egg s, and dairyfoods. T here is no way that healthy animal foods can be raised in an industrial system. T o find these foods, visit realmilk.com , o r contact your nearest local chapter of the W eston A. Price Foundation ( westonaprice.or g ). For grains and produce, buying or ganic is important\u2014especially when it co mes to wheat products. Buy ing or ganic bread, crackers, and flour will ensure that the wheat has not been sprayed with glyphosate just before harvest. Or ganic produce is now widely available, even in supermarkets. An i mportant resource is the Shopping Guide published by the W eston A. Price Foundation.
