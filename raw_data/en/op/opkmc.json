(preprint) preprints.org; acute emerging more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants (BQ1 and XBB1) for more effective immunogens and [therapeutic approaches]to protect the lives of numerous SARS-CoV-2 affected individuals and reduce overall [disease burden]that could be affected by concurrent other pathogens causing [diseases]. Following a worldwide campaign of [mass vaccination], there is still a significant demand to quell the harmful effects of novel SARS-CoV-2 [infections]due to higher [mutation rates]within specific areas of the SARS-CoV-2 domain, leading to enhanced [viral entry], especially within individuals with one or more significant comorbidities, and there is still a dilemma of how prevention of [future] [pandemics] [will]occur as within host [animal] [mutations]and cross species transfer naturally occurs. Concerns intersect at a specific point; a gained evolutionary [ability]of several [viruses]over the previous centuries to remain undetected during the first stages of [infection]by means of capping the 5' end of their [DNA]and [RNA] [genes]respectively. This may occur by reducing the rate of host Type I and [Type III Interferons](IFN) cellular synthesis, that would usually occur and [affect]both apoptotic pathways, that facilitate [viral replication]and clearance, as well as immune [cells], that process and present pathogenic [antigen] [epitopes]. Furthermore, although [methods]of [vaccination]exist, other [methods]in clinical development remain that could evoke an [immune response]in different cellular, [serum]or mucosal compartments that evoke differential [antibody responses]. [Antibodies]are classed as natural and synthetic. Natural [antibodies]are further classified into neutralizing and non-neutralizing, whilst synthetic [antibodies]are also further classified into monoclonal and polyclonal. As a result of single [cell]study [transcriptome] [research], [viruses]do utilize an array of [protein]receptors for receptor-mediated cellular entry. This, therefore suggests that potential differential [production]of antibody [immunoglobulins](Ig) within [serum]and mucosal areas remains affected by adhesion molecules and [plasma] offering less mucosal [plasma] epithelial surfaces provide effective [immune responses]in some [viral infections]. The existence of developments that stimulate [mucosal immune responses]has so far only been seen with [influenza]nasal immunogens. Nevertheless, scientists developed ways of [immunization]and early [treatment]worldwide that generally showed good success rates and fewer [risks]of adverse events, and the still early present stages of COVID-19 [research]should also be taken into consideration. For example, the [administration]of [human] [interferons]I and III into the [nasal mucosa]cellular layer, as key mediators of anti-viral activity, can stimulate cellular activity to train the innate and adaptive [immune system] [cells]to develop and appropriately stimulate an adequate [immune response]through B and [T cells]. Recently, it was discovered that specific [plants]secrete [proteins]that also stimulate the [production]of [Type I Interferons]. It might be that focusing on directly offering the [immune system]the information about the [genetics]and [protein]structure of the pathogen, rather than [training]its first-line mechanisms to develop faster, excessively increases its [specificity], making it reach a level that brings the [virus]the opportunity to evolve and escape previously-developed host immune mechanisms. Naturally-selected polymorphic [viruses]through [genetic recombination]pose challenges to traditional concepts of cellular and molecular [immune system]neutralization of these [viruses]during the first stages of cellular [infection]. It is until the scientific [community]realizes this potentially crucial aspect that we [will]probably continue to [face]serious [epidemics]and [pandemics]of [respiratory diseases]over the decades, [dengue fever]and more recently [monkeypox]. Type I IFNs tend to be produced faster than [Type III IFNs], and the first induce slightly more abundant pro-inflammatory signals than the latter, meaning that [type III IFNs], if produced early, may further decrease the extent of excessive proinflammatory signals. Hence, we believe that [nasal sprays]containing a low [dosage]of Type I and [Type III IFNs]not only represent a relevant COVID-19 [therapeutic], but also a potential unknown modulatory [therapy]of the [future]. Of note, it has been indicated that IFN I and / or III display significant immunizing and early [therapeutic effects]for ... LILACS LIS "}
