My family has been trying meticulously hard to be vigilant, maintain distance and regularly test ourselves\u2014only to one day have it culminate into a dreaded positive result. And it belonged to none other than me. As a relatively fit 39-year-old, I was stunned when I tested positive. Surprisingly, I experienced a combined feeling of relief of finally contracting Covid-19 (while not having any symptoms) and trepidation that it may get worse. I was concerned for those around me. It has been a mental rollercoaster of isolation, peace, confusion and rest. Below, I will share more about my recovery journey.

She is a healthy 35-year-old yoga enthusiast, and in September of 2020, being unvaccinated, the virus definitely took a toll on her. She recovered well but being unvaccinated made it arduously harder to fight off the virus. I remember her genuine fear when she found out, compared to my reaction when I tested positive. Being vaccinated and not having major symptoms, made me slightly fearful but I accepted I just had to ride it out. We all routinely test at home with our Antigen Rapid Test (ART) kits, which was how I found out I was positive. I wasn't feeling unwell, just a little tired. Of course, everyone's reaction to the virus is different; depending on age, underlying health concerns, and other factors. I felt positive that I could take this virus down. I just had to stay isolated, positive and as healthy as possible. Preparing for Positive One of my closest friends recently described how she has kept her guestroom prepped and ready in case someone in her household of seven comes down with the virus. I thought that was forward-thinking and practical, and when I tested positive, I immediately took control of my bedroom. In hindsight, I wish I had arranged a few items ahead of time, such as Vitamin C and zinc, pre and probiotics, extra fluids like coconut water, paracetamols, thermometers, tissue boxes, more rapid antigen tests, and a few cleaning supplies. Having these items on hand can help with the initial anxiety and sets the rest of your household at ease as well. I also brought in my laptop and work items, yoga mat, and body roller, simultaneously transferring my husband's items out the door. "}
