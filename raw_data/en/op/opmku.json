Covid-19 vaccines not linked to Sudden Arrhythmic Death Syndromes Social media posts claim \"Sudden Adult Death Syndrome\" is a new condition linked to the Covid-19 vaccine, proving that Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is also a vaccine side effect. This is false; leading health organizations and medical experts say Sudden Arrhythmic Death Syndromes (SADS) -- misnamed in the posts -- is not a new set of heart disorders, and neither SADS nor SIDS has been identified as an adverse event following vaccination. 27 June 2022 More [here](/doc.afp.com.32D388Z). 1394. US author Naomi Wolf falsely claims Covid-19 vaccinated mothers caused 'baby die-off' A video clip of US author Naomi Wolf claiming that \"there is a baby die-off\" in infants born to Covid-19 vaccinated mothers has been viewed hundreds of times on Facebook.

Posts misleadingly link AstraZeneca Covid jab to monkeypox cases Social media posts shared worldwide claim that recent cases of monkeypox outside of countries where it is endemic are a \"side effect\" of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, which uses a weakened chimpanzee adenovirus vector that has been altered so it does not infect humans or replicate. This is misleading; health experts told AFP the virus that causes monkeypox is different from AstraZeneca's adenovirus vector, which does not cause disease in humans. 14 June 2022 More [here](/doc.afp.com.32B674W). 1390.

Posts misrepresent monkeypox and make misleading link with Covid vaccine After the World Health Organization (WHO) reported outbreaks of monkeypox in countries where the disease is not endemic, multiple social media posts claimed that the virus is the same as shingles and therefore a \"side effect\" of the Covid-19 vaccine. However, health experts told AFP that the virus causing shingles and the one causing Covid are completely unrelated. Furthermore, Australia's vaccine regulator told AFP there is currently insufficient evidence that Covid vaccines \"trigger\" shingles. The posts shared a stock image of shingles that was erroneously used to illustrate monkeypox. 9 June 2022 More [here](/doc.afp.com.32BN4FZ). 1387. WHO did not approve Thai food supplement to 'prevent long Covid' Facebook posts circulating in Thailand claim the World Health Organization approved a dietary supplement to prevent long Covid.

Edited video misrepresents Pfizer CEO's comments at World Economic Forum A video has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times in social media posts that claim it shows Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla saying the US pharmaceutical giant aims to cut the world's population in half by 2023.

Disinfectant spraying has been part of China's arsenal in its fight against the coronavirus, but the photos were actually taken during a Covid-19 testing drive in a mountainous township in Qinghai.

Pfizer documents do not reveal dangers of Covid-19 vaccine Social media posts and online articles have made a series of inaccurate claims about the safety and efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, sometimes asserting the revelations come from leaks of confidential documents from the pharmaceutical company. But health regulators and independent experts say the data -- which is being officially released by the US Food and Drug Administration -- does not show the shot is dangerous or ineffective. 16 May 2022 More [here](/doc.afp.com.329Y6J4). 1372. Article reporting Pfizer VP's arrest is satire Social media posts say that Pfizer's Executive Vice President Rady Johnson has been arrested and charged with fraud.

Posts falsely claim Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine dangerous during pregnancy Social media posts claim documents recently released by Pfizer show that the company's Covid-19 vaccine is unsafe for those who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

Social media posts mislead on vaccination programme pause in Denmark A claim that Denmark has entirely shut down its Covid-19 vaccination programme has been shared thousands of times in social media posts in April 2022.

Old photos misleadingly linked to end of outdoor mask mandate in South Korea Two images have circulated online in South Korea alongside a claim they show foreign students not wearing face masks while local students kept theirs on after the government lifted its outdoor mask mandate. While a poll found majority of South Koreans still prefer masking outdoors, the photos were shared in a misleading context. The first image of a group of maskless foreign students predates the Covid pandemic, while the second photo circulated in news reports weeks before South Korea's outdoor mask mandate was eased. 9 May 2022 More [here](/doc.afp.com.329F6F2). 1368. False posts about 'Covid vaccine requirement for voters' spread ahead of Philippine poll Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and TikTok posts circulating ahead of the Philippines' polls on May 9 claim voters are required to present proof of Covid vaccination or a negative coronavirus test in order to vote.

Although the posts shared genuine data from a single day in April, health experts told AFP vaccination is still critical to reducing the overall rate of death and severe illness from Covid-19. All of the deaths mentioned in the post were in people aged 60 or above, who experts said were at an increased risk of death from the disease. 6 May 2022 More [here](/doc.afp.com.328W9C3). 1366. Hepatitis outbreak in children misleadingly linked to Covid-19 vaccination Online articles shared hundreds of thousands of times on social media claim the global outbreak of severe hepatitis in children is linked to Covid-19 vaccines, citing an April 2022 study as evidence. But health authorities and independent experts dismissed the idea that the shots are to blame, saying most of those affected were too young to be vaccinated and that the study refers to the case of an adult with a different type of hepatitis. 5 May 2022 More [here](/doc.afp.com.329J2TA) 1365. Misleading video suggests people in China 'face death penalty for not wearing a mask' A video viewed hundreds of thousands of times on social media appears to show a Chinese official warning that residents could face the death penalty if they do not wear a mask in public.

Fauci remark on flu vaccination does not negate Covid-19 advice Facebook posts claim top US infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci contradicted himself by advising all Americans to get vaccinated against Covid-19, citing a years-old clip in which the doctor says a person who recovered from influenza need not receive a flu shot. But Covid-19 and the flu are distinct diseases, Fauci's advice in the 2004 video was specific to one person, and scientists are still researching the durability of natural immunity following Covid-19 infection. 28 April 2022 More [here](/doc.afp.com.32934KM). 1360. Anthony Fauci was not arrested by US military An online article claims that American special forces arrested top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci on April 9, 2022 on charges of treason, malpractice, conspiracy and homicide.
