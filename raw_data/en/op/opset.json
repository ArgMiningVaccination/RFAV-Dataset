Substances increasing libido alter the concentrations of specific neurotransmitters or sex hormones in the central nervous system. Interestingly, the same pathways are involved in the mechanisms underlying many psychiatric and neurological disorders, and adverse reactions associated with the use of aphrodisiacs are strongly expected. However, sexual enhancers of plant origin have gained popularity over recent years, as natural substances are often regarded as a safer alternative to modern medications and are easily acquired without prescription. We reviewed the psychiatric and neurological adverse effects associated with the consumption of herbal aphrodisiacs Areca catechu L., Argemone Mexicana L., Citrus aurantium L., Eurycoma longifolia Jack., Lepidium meyenii Walp., Mitragyna speciosa Korth., Panax ginseng C. A. Mey, Panax quinquefolius L., Pausinystalia johimbe (K. Schum.) Pierre ex Beille, Piper methysticum G. Forst., Ptychopetalum olacoides Benth., Sceletium tortuosum (L.) N. E. Brown, Turnera diffusa Willd. ex. Schult., Voacanga africana Stapf ex Scott-Elliot, and Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal. A literature search was conducted on the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases with the aim of identifying all the relevant articles published on the issue up to June 2020. Most of the selected sexual enhancers appeared to be safe at therapeutic doses, although mild to severe adverse effects may occur in cases of overdosing or self-medication with unstandardized products. Drug interactions are more concerning, considering that herbal aphrodisiacs are likely used together with other plant extracts and/or pharmaceuticals. However, few data are available on the side effects of several plants included in this review, and more clinical studies with controlled administrations should be conducted to address this issue.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-10-14", "cleaned_text": "Review of Psychiatric and Neurological Adverse Effects [https://doi.org/10.3390/ph13100309](https://doi.org/10.3390/ph13100309) [Clinical and the use of psychoactive and/or stimulant drugs during intercourse, i.e., chemsex, is on the rise [ [2](#B2-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Nowadays, sexual performance anxiety, which contributes to psychogenic erectile dysfunction, is estimated to affect 9 to 25% of men in the United States, and phytotherapy is often employed as a treatment [ [3](#B3-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. In 2007, approximately 56% of infertile couples had sought medical care worldwide [ [4](#B4-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)] and many of these couples had opted for supportive complementary and alternative medicines to treat infertility. In 2010, in the United States, approximately 29% of 428 infertile couples had utilized an alternative treatment after 18 months of observation, 59% of which had taken herbal therapy [ [5](#B5-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Natural substances are mistakenly believed to be a safer alternative to modern medications with no side effects. They are also readily accessible on the Internet and specialized markets without a prescription. Consequently, the use of herbal supplements to enhance sexual drive has become increasingly popular, and more than 300,000 intoxications were reported to poison control centers over the last 20 years [ [6](#B6-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [7](#B7-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. [8](#B8-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Potency-enhancing substances typically induce vasodilation, often through the nitric oxide (NO) pathway, inducing hypotension and potentially harmful cardiovascular effects (e.g., sildenafil and L-arginine). Sexual pleasure-enhancing substances cause tumescence and lubrication of the genital mucosa, therefore increasing sensation (e.g., cantharidin). Libido-enhancing substances alter the concentrations of specific neurotransmitters (e.g., dopaminergic and serotoninergic pathways) or sex hormones (e.g., pituitary hormones and testosterone) in the central nervous system (CNS) [ [8](#B8-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. For example, methamphetamine is a synthetic illicit psychomotor stimulant affecting the mesolimbic dopamine pathway, which plays an essential role in motivation and the reward system. A substantial body of evidence shows that acute methamphetamine use is associated with enhanced positive sexual experiences and libido, with a greater likelihood of engaging in high-risk sexual behaviors. Sexual behavior, however, may be impaired due to chronic methamphetamine exposure [ [9](#B9-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. [10](#B10-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Contrariwise, mania is believed to be the consequence of an excess of the same monoamines in specific regions of the brain [ [11](#B11-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Schizophrenia, however, mainly involves dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmissions [ [12](#B12-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. In neurology, a deficit of dopamine due to the death of cells in the substantia nigra is the primary cause of Parkinson's disease, while Alzheimer's disease is due to the degeneration of the hippocampus and the raphe nuclei, affecting the cholinergic pathway [ [13](#B13-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. The drugs approved to treat psychiatric and neurological conditions mainly target these neurotransmission pathways. [6](#B6-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. In March 2020, Srivatsav et al. reviewed the efficacy and the safety profile of several common aphrodisiacs used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction, but the study was not exhaustive and psychiatric and neurological adverse effects were not addressed [ [14](#B14-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. In this review, we aimed to summarize and interpret the findings of cases and preclinical and clinical studies reporting psychiatric and neurological adverse effects associated with the use of aphrodisiacs of plant origin. A preliminary screening of the literature allowed for the identification of several plants with potential psychiatric or neurological complications, which were therefore included in this review: Areca catechu L., Argemone 2. Results [Figure 1](#pharmaceuticals-13-00309-f001). A general description of each species including their traditional and modern uses, active ingredients with their mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics, and general toxicity, is provided in the discussion. Psychiatric and neurological adverse events reported in the literature are displayed in [Table 1](#pharmaceuticals-13-00309-t001); study conditions and co-exposures are also detailed. 3. Discussion 3.1. Areca catechu L. (Betel Nut) [23](#B23-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [154](#B154-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. The fruit, obtained from the palm tree, Areca catechu L., is commonly chewed in Southeast Asia and the South Pacific islands [ [155](#B155-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [156](#B156-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)] for its antiparasitic, digestive, euphoric, and aphrodisiac effects [ [157](#B157-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [158](#B158-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. There are two main ways to prepare areca nut for chewing: wrapping a split unripe nut with lime paste (calcium oxide) in a betel tree leaf or inserting a piece of Piper betel L. inflorescence with lime paste into arecoline and guvacoline are hydrolyzed to arecaidine and [ [163](#B163-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [164](#B164-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Areca alkaloids mediate the autonomic responses of the parasympathetic nervous system and the synaptic transmission in the peripheral nervous system [ [164](#B164-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [165](#B165-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [166](#B166-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)], and impact various aspects of brain function and regulation [ [167](#B167-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [168](#B168-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Arecoline is a partial muscarinic (M) agonist and possesses a higher affinity for M receptors than guvacoline [ [24](#B24-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [169](#B169-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. High arecoline doses [ [170](#B170-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. As tertiary amines, arecoline and, to a lesser extent, arecaidine have a deep brain penetration [ [165](#B165-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [169](#B169-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. It was demonstrated that arecoline enhances cognition and memory and significantly improves several behavioral disorders in patients with Alzheimer's disease or schizophrenia, through the activation of postsynaptic M1 receptors [ [24](#B24-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [162](#B162-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [171](#B171-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. In addition, improvements in positive and negative symptoms of psychosis have been observed in schizophrenic areca nut chewers [ [155](#B155-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [172](#B172-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [173](#B173-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. It is believed that arecoline reduces the dopaminergic hyperactivity underlying the positive symptoms of psychosis throughout the modulation of M1, M2, and M4 receptors, and induces dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex, the striatum, and the ventral negative symptoms [ [169](#B169-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [174](#B174-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [175](#B175-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Furthermore, the release of dopamine and other catecholamines causes stimulant and libido-enhancing effects [ [3](#B3-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [156](#B156-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [166](#B166-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) caused by aromatic phenolic compounds of the plant, may also explain the antidepressant properties of the areca is taken in high quantities, transient extrapyramidal symptoms including rigidity, bradykinesia, and jaw tremor may occur [ [24](#B24-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [176](#B176-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [180](#B180-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. These effects are probably due to guvacine and arecaidine, which are strong inhibitors of -aminobutyric acid (GABA) reuptake and contribute to the reduction in spontaneous activity and body excitability [ [181](#B181-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [182](#B182-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [183](#B183-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. However, it was also demonstrated that areca alkaloids reduce GABA affinity for the GABAA receptor, and arecaidine and guvacine effects on GABA signaling may cause epileptic seizures [ [23](#B23-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [169](#B169-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [180](#B180-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [184](#B184-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. The main risks associated with the chronic consumption of betel nut are related to its metabolism. Indeed, areca alkaloids are converted into DNA alkylating nitrosamines, which cause cell proliferation and oxidative stress-dependent neurotoxicity, leading to oral [ [24](#B24-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [158](#B158-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [183](#B183-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [185](#B185-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Albeit its use is culturally well accepted, the betel nut is a strongly addictive substance and multiple adverse effects were reported ( [Table 1](#pharmaceuticals-13-00309-t001)). Tolerance and nicotine/amphetamine-like withdrawal syndrome, characterized by insomnia, mood swings, irritability, and anxiety, may appear after repeated intakes [ [16](#B16-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [167](#B167-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [179](#B179-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. 3.2. Citrus aurantium L. (Bitter Orange) [186](#B186-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Bitter orange tree's leaves, flowers, fruits peels, and seeds have been used for centuries to treat tachycardia, rheumatism, insomnia, anxiety, epilepsy, and gastrointestinal disorders and to enhance sexual desire [ [187](#B187-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [188](#B188-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [189](#B189-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. [190](#B190-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. The most abundant flavonoids naringenin, which possess, together with terpenoids, carotenoids, and ascorbic acid, a free radical-scavenging ability and inhibit proinflammatory mediators release, exerting a powerful antioxidant activity and reducing tumoral cell proliferation -myrcene, linalyl acetate, and linalool are the main volatile components of the plant [ [193](#B193-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [194](#B194-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)], and are distilled or extracted from blooms, leaves, and orange peel to obtain essential oils (EOs) [ [195](#B195-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. These substances, especially d-limonene, modify the cell membrane of microbes and denature enzymes responsible for their germination and sporulation, showing antimicrobic and antifungal properties [ [191](#B191-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [196](#B196-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. For these reasons, bitter orange tree's EOs are widely sold as flavoring and preservative agents in foods and drinks [ [190](#B190-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [197](#B197-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Recently, a great interest in these EOs has been observed in the context of alternative medicines such as aromatherapy. It was demonstrated that these substances, after vaporization and inhalation, are effective for treating different forms of anxiety, sleep, and libido, and reduce seizures in animal models [ [38](#B38-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [39](#B39-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [198](#B198-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [199](#B199-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [200](#B200-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [201](#B201-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. The mechanism of action the plant's ingredients, however, is not fully elucidated. Anxiolytic and hypnotic effects are seemingly due to the combination of the action of the plant's aroma on the limbic system through olfaction and the direct action of terpenes [Table 1](#pharmaceuticals-13-00309-t001). The US Food and Drug Administration confirmed that oral administration of bitter orange extracts is safe [ [39](#B39-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)], and its derivatives have gained popularity as dietary supplements over the last few years [ [200](#B200-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [204](#B204-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Standardized derivatives containing 4-6% synephrine, an ephedrine-like alkaloid naturally occurring in C. aurantium and possessing - and -adrenergic properties, are available [ [3](#B3-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [40](#B40-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [205](#B205-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Although synephrine has become one of the most popular stimulants in weight loss products, cardiovascular adverse effects including increased blood pressure, tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, transient collapse, myocardial infarction, and cardiac arrest have been reported [ [206](#B206-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Headache and gastrointestinal symptoms have also been reported. 3.3. Mitragyna speciosa Korth. (Kratom) [207](#B207-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. In these countries, the plant has been exploited for centuries for its stimulant and narcotic properties and is commonly self-administrated by manual laborers to combat fatigue and improve productivity [ [51](#B51-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Mitragyna leaves are traditionally chewed, smoked, or boiled with hot water and served as a tea [ [208](#B208-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. New preparations such as capsules, resins, or tinctures are now available on the Internet and are purchased in Europe and in America for recreational use or as herbal products [ [209](#B209-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [210](#B210-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. [211](#B211-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Mitragynine is the most abundant active compound and accounts for up to 66% of the total mass of crude alkaloids extract. Other major alkaloids are paynantheine, which is the second most abundant alkaloid (10% of total content), speciogynine, and speciociliatine. Among the various minor alkaloids, 7-hydroxymitragynine is of particular interest due to its important role in mediating the analgesic effect of mitragynine [ [157](#B157-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Both mitragynine and its oxidized metabolite 7-hydroxymitragynine are partial agonists of \u00b5-opioid receptors (MOR) and competitive antagonists of - and -opioid receptors (KOR and DOR), which are involved in analgesia. However, mitragynine affinity for opioid receptors is lower than that of morphine, while 7-hydroxymitragynine affinity is approximately 46 and 13 times higher than that of mitragynine and morphine, respectively [ [212](#B212-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. The possible stimulant and libido-enhancing effects of mitragynine may be due to the blockade of serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors and the postsynaptic stimulation of 2 adrenergic receptors (2R) in the CNS [ [212](#B212-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Recently, LaBryer et al. hypothesized that kratom have testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone and hypogonadism [ [213](#B213-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Mitragynine also binds adenosine A2A D2 receptors, and serotonin receptors 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, but the physiological significance of these interactions is unclear [ [214](#B214-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Data showed that low kratom doses (1-5 g) induce stimulating effects, involving the release of neurotransmitters by reversible blockade of calcium channels. At higher doses (>15 g), it can cause sedative/narcotic effects, and the plant can be used as a general analgesic, as an opium substitute, or to treat opium withdrawal symptoms [ [215](#B215-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. [51](#B51-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)] reported a cross-sectional survey investigating the correlation between frequency and quantity of kratom consumption, and the risk of addiction development and the severity of withdrawal symptoms and craving in regular user [ [216](#B216-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Cessation of kratom use produced physical withdrawal symptoms similar to those of opiate addiction including pain, sleep disorders, muscle spasms, watery eyes, runny nose, hot flashes, fever, decreased appetite, diarrhea, and craving. Psychological withdrawal symptoms reported by users included restlessness, tension, anger, and depression [ [217](#B217-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)] ( [Table 1](#pharmaceuticals-13-00309-t001)). 3.4. Panax ginseng C. A. Mey (Asian Ginseng) and Panax quinquefolius L. (American Ginseng) [218](#B218-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. American ginseng medical use is more recent and has gained popularity in Western countries over recent decades. Ginseng health benefits were demonstrated in many clinical studies in various fields: it has shown aphrodisiac, anti-inflammatory, anticancer (lung, liver, intestine, and stomach), antidiabetic, cardioprotective, gastroprotective, antiamnestic, and antioxidative (heart and kidney) properties [ [219](#B219-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. The fresh root of ginseng can be directly chewed after peeling or soaked in wine for drinking and chewing. In China and Korea, it is boiled with chicken to prepare energy drinks, teas, and candies [ [218](#B218-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. [220](#B220-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. After oral administration, ginsenosides are mainly metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, undergoing successive deglycosylations: Rg3 is a metabolite of Rb1, Rb2, Rb3, Rd, and is metabolized Rh2; Rg2 is a metabolite of Re; and metabolite of both Rg1 and Rg2. Ginsenosides have low oral bioavailability, owing to their low membrane permeability and their degradation in the gastrointestinal tract [ [219](#B219-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Rg1 induces NO synthesis in endothelial cells and perivascular nerves, and increases vascular smooth muscle sensitivity to NO, prolonging the erection in males and enhancing sexual potency. In addition, P. ginseng was proved to increase testosterone, LH, and FSH in healthy volunteers through Rg1 and Rb1, enhancing libido. Re increases extracellular dopamine and acetylcholine in rat brains, and Rc is also an agonist of GABAB receptors. These modulations of several neurotransmission pathways may have an effect at different levels of the hypothalamus-pituitary-testis axis [ [221](#B221-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Mancuso and Santangelo recently reviewed the effects of ginsenosides on the immune system (e.g., modulation of the immune response, anti-inflammatory effects), the nervous system (e.g., regulation of the stress axis, improvement of memory and learning functions), and the cardiovascular system (e.g., improvement of cardiac performance, cardioprotective clinical studies with ginseng or ginsenosides reported no psychiatric or neurological side effects or statistically insignificant effects compared to placebo, and were not included in [Table 1](#pharmaceuticals-13-00309-t001)[ [223](#B223-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [224](#B224-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [225](#B225-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [226](#B226-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [227](#B227-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. A few cases of headache following ginseng administration were reported without placebo control [ [84](#B84-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [91](#B91-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Insomnia, agitation, and fatigue were more frequent [ [82](#B82-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [83](#B83-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [84](#B84-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [89](#B89-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [94](#B94-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)], but still uncommon. More interestingly, several cases of manic-like effects, such as confusion, agitation, irritation, nervousness, anxiety, and bizarre behavior, without history of psychiatric disorder, were reported following ginseng use [ [77](#B77-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [78](#B78-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [81](#B81-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [85](#B85-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [87](#B87-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [88](#B88-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [90](#B90-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [228](#B228-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. These cases, however, were isolated and generally resulted from high ginseng doses or with the concomitant use of other substances (e.g., phenelzine, cannabis, herbal supplements); mania was not reported in clinical studies using ginseng alone or in combination. In fact, ginseng toxicity mainly comes from drug interactions with cytochromes P450 (CYPs) CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors and serotoninergic drugs, intensifying sedative effects or inducing cognitive disorders or a serotonin syndrome [ [229](#B229-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [230](#B230-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), Yohimbine is marketed as a pharmaceutical prescribed for the treatment of erectile impotence and has been used in multiple clinical trials as a probe to identify abnormal physiological and affective responses to increased noradrenergic signaling, especially in patients with panic disorders [ [235](#B235-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [236](#B236-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Yohimbine is a potent selective 2R antagonist with 1R antagonist activity that blocks the presynaptic feedback inhibition of noradrenaline release, prolonging the excitatory and [238](#B238-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Yohimbine a relatively short half-life due to an extensive hepatic metabolism, which produces two main hydroxylated metabolites, 11- and 10-hydroxyyohimbine, that are rapidly excreted in urine [ [239](#B239-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [240](#B240-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. There is increasing interest in botanic dietary supplements containing yohimbine extracts in the context of sexual and body enhancement [ [241](#B241-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. [242](#B242-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)], and provokes noradrenergic amygdala and to mood and behavior alterations ( [Table 1](#pharmaceuticals-13-00309-t001)). Due to these potential cardiac and neurological adverse effects, yohimbine was used in patients with difficulties to reach orgasm, with erectile dysfunction, or with low libido, mainly before the emergence of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil), which present a better safety profile [ [243](#B243-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [244](#B244-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. The yohimbine mechanism of action is currently unclear. There is evidence suggesting that yohimbine increases libido by blocking 2R in the locus coeruleus, which is involved in the control of the erection. Peripherally, it was suggested that yohimbine enhances NO release from cavernosal endothelial cells, producing a relaxation of smooth muscle cells and consequent erection, increasing sexual potency [ [3](#B3-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [6](#B6-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [237](#B237-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Moderate to severe adverse effects like sweating, flushing, hypertension, tachycardia, palpitations, bronchospasm, chest pain, and atrial fibrillation are reported after deliberate or accidental ingestion, while lethal intoxications are extremely rare [ [245](#B245-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [246](#B246-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. 3.6. Piper methysticum G. Forst. (Kava) [19](#B19-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Kava is considered as a sacred beverage in Pacific islands [ [247](#B247-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. The plant has also been used in traditional medicine, first as a treatment for venereal diseases, then later as a sedative and treatment for anxiety and sleep disorders, to decrease fatigue, and to relieve pain [ [248](#B248-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. [249](#B249-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Kava extracts produce a similar activity profile as that of benzodiazepines, which interact with GABA receptors, inhibit the MAO-B, and inhibit dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake in the CNS, inducing libido-enhancing properties [ [250](#B250-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. In vitro studies of the hippocampus and other brain regions suggest that the sedative effects of kavalactones may be mediated by an increase in GABAA receptor binding sites [ [251](#B251-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [252](#B252-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. It was demonstrated that several kavalactones are potent inhibitors of several CYP metabolic enzymes [ [253](#B253-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Oral pharmacokinetics of kawain (100 mg/kg) were determined in rats with and without co-administration of kava extract (256 mg/kg). The results showed that kawain was well absorbed, and more than 90% of the dose was eliminated within 72 h, mainly in urine [ [254](#B254-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. [255](#B255-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)], dermopathy [ [256](#B256-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)], and cognitive disorders [ [257](#B257-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Sedation with drowsiness and dizziness is commonly reported in clinical trials with administration of kava or methysticin ( [Table 1](#pharmaceuticals-13-00309-t001)), which Ptychopetalum olacoides Benth. (Muirapuama) [258](#B258-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. The native communities have used its roots and barks as a treatment for depression, sexual dysfunction, and as a \"nerve tonic\" [ [259](#B259-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Roots are usually prepared in alcoholic infusion, but other formulations have also been employed (e.g., mixture of extracts, solutions, pills) [ [260](#B260-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. [261](#B261-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Other compounds detected in muirapuama are fatty acid of sterols, coumarin, free fatty acids, and free sterol; a small quantity of -sitosterol was also detected [ [262](#B262-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Based on ethnopharmacological data, it can be hypothesized that muirapuama interacts with the dopaminergic system, increasing libido; the noradrenergic system, inducing antidepressant effects; and the serotonergic system, modulating appetite. The antinociceptive effects of the plant were investigated in thermal and chemical models of nociception in mice. Data showed that the maximal effect was reached 6 h after administration of a low dose of muirapuama extract and produces significant and long-lasting (up 12 h) effects in both chemical and thermal tests of nociception in mice. In addition, higher doses, either acutely or subchronically (15 days), did not cause a worsening of adverse effects [ [263](#B263-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. A few neurological side effects were reported in preclinical studies, including impairment of both short- and long-term memory and reduced locomotion [ [151](#B151-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [152](#B152-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)] ( (Kanna) [264](#B264-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [265](#B265-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. The dried aerial parts of the plant are commonly chewed or consumed as teas, decoctions, and tinctures and sometimes smoked or snuffed [ [266](#B266-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. [267](#B267-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [268](#B268-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [269](#B269-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. In fact, the plant is widely sold over the Internet and specialized herbal shops to increase sexual performance, although its mechanism of action and effects were not clearly demonstrated. This dual inhibitory effect has been studied for the development of compounds for the treatment of cognition impairment, motor dysfunction, depression, and neurodegeneration [ [270](#B270-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Mesembrenone is the most potent inhibitor of PDE4A, while mesembrine is more selective towards the serotonin receptor. In addition, mesembrine is also 2-opioid, -opioid, cholecystokinin-1, and melatonin-1 receptors at high doses, and shows antinociceptive effects in animal models [ [266](#B266-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [270](#B270-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [271](#B271-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [272](#B272-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [273](#B273-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Recently, S. tortuosum has been marketed for the treatment of mild depression and to improve mood [ [274](#B274-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Zembrin\u00ae, a standardized hydroalcoholic extract, was found to be safe and well-tolerated in preclinical studies with mild adverse effects ( [Table 1](#pharmaceuticals-13-00309-t001)) and is widely sold as a dietary supplement [ [275](#B275-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Another commercially available product is Trimesemine, a highly-concentrated mesembrine extract (3% mesembrine (w/w)) that the expression of vesicular monoaminetransporter-2 (VMAT-2), increasing monoamines [ [276](#B276-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [277](#B277-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Kanna alkaloids are metabolized in the liver to O,N-demethylated or dehydroxylated compounds, which are then excreted as glucuronides sulfates conjugates [ [277](#B277-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [278](#B278-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. 3.9. Other Plants [279](#B279-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. The plant, however, presents a good safety profile [ [279](#B279-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)], and only one case of a manic-like episode following consumption in a patient without history of psychiatric disorders was reported [ [280](#B280-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Ashwagandha is an evergreen shrub of the family Solanaceae, which is cultivated in hot and dry areas of tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Ashwagandha has numerous applications in traditional Indian medicines and has been used for more than 5000 years as an aphrodisiac, many other purposes. Positive effect in insomnia, anxiety, chronic stress, weight management, thyroid gland function, telomerase, cardio-respiratory endurance, muscle strength, recovery of male and female sexual function, and senescence was demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies [ [164](#B164-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Excellent tolerability is generally reported after using ashwagandha for weeks at therapeutic doses, with statistically insignificant adverse effects compared to placebo [ [281](#B281-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [282](#B282-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. [283](#B283-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Recently, the plant also proved to induce anxiolytic and antidepressant effects in preclinical studies [ [283](#B283-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [284](#B284-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. However, no psychiatric or neurological side effects related to damania were reported. Another interesting example is Voacanga africana Stapf ex Scott-Elliot, a shrub/small tree of tropical Africa whose seeds have been recently commercialized as a poison, stimulant, aphrodisiac, and ceremonial psychedelic [ [285](#B285-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Although the plant contains a variety of indole alkaloids related to (Tabernanthe iboga Baill.) that has also been used as an aphrodisiac [ [286](#B286-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)], there is no evidence of positive effects on sexual function. In addition, although Voacanga africana alkaloids may modulate neuronal excitability and have positive effects in Alzheimer's disease [ [287](#B287-pharmaceuticals-13-00309), [288](#B288-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)], no neurological or psychiatric complications related to the plant were reported. There is also little information on the side effects of the Mexican poppy (Argemone mexicana L.) and Tongkat Ali (Eurycoma longifolia Jack.). [14](#B14-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. 3.10. General Discussion [289](#B289-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. [290](#B290-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Consequently, these plants are often taken concomitantly with contaminants, medications, and other herbal therapies or dietary supplements: drug interactions represent the most significant health risks of herbal aphrodisiacs and psychiatric and neurological adverse effects have been reported [ [230](#B230-pharmaceuticals-13-00309)]. Medical doctors should be aware of the potential drug interactions with aphrodisiacs and dietary supplements when prescribing a pharmaceutical drug. 3.11.
