Summary of Amendments This guideline is a living document which is reviewed and updated as emerging evidence and treatments become availa ble for use in Ireland , when there are changes to the dominant variant and when the clinical prioritisation of patient cohorts change . The amendments to this version are as follows: 1. Paxlovid is now recommended for patients in Tier 3 of the Clinical Priori tisation table in Appendix 2.0 of this document: Vaccinated adult patients at high risk of severe disease (adults aged over 75 years or adults aged over 65 years with additional risks )*** *** Additional risks include obesity (BMI over 35), diabetes melli tus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, clinical risk factor conditions not meeting full definition for inclusion in Tier 1 2. The testing requirements to confirm a positive diagnosis of COVID -19 infection prior to consideration of pr escribing Paxlovid has also been changed. During periods of high levels of community transmission of COVID -19, as is currently being experienced, a positive self - administered antigen test is considered sufficient for consideration of prescribing Paxlovid 3. Appendix 3 Table 1: Therapies which may alter vaccine response - this table has been updated to include a more comprehensive list of therapies that may alter vaccine response. 4. Sotrovimab has been removed from the main recommendation section of the gui dance and repositioned to Appendix 6 in light of the observed decrease in in vitro neutralisation against Omicron BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5 sub -variants. sub-variant s now account for almost all COVID -19 cases in Ireland1. All physicians across p rimary and secondary care and hospital pharmacists should be advised of the reduced efficacy of sotrovimab against the Omicron sub -variant s suggesting an unfavourable change to the risk:benefit balance for an individual patient, highlighting the importance of Multi -Disciplinary Team guidance for use of this therapy .

Background This is the fifth version of a living guideline and i t replaces the fourth version. Many pharmacological therapies are being used and many eme rging therapeutics are being considered for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19). This document aims to support clinicians and other healthcare professionals in their decision about treatment and management of patients with COVID -19. The fi rst four versions were d eveloped from published evidence and recommendations of the COVID -19 Therapeutic Advisory Group (TAG) . The purpose of the TAG was to provide clinical advice and recommendations to the Chief Clinical Officer (CCO) on the use of all e xisting and emerging CO VID-19 therapeutic medications. In response to the change in the national landscape for COVID -19, the TAG has now been stepped down. This fifth version of the guideline has been developed by the COVID -19 Therapeutics Guideline Expert Committee (TG EC) which has been established under the governance of the National Clinical Advisor and Group Lead (NCAGL) for Acute Hospitals to provide clinical advice on current and emerging COVID -19 therapeutics to the CCO.

This w ill support th e generation of relevant data to help inform evidence -based guidance and support clinicians and other healthcare professionals in the management of patient s with COVID -19. A record of registered and ongoing clinical trials for COVID -19 is available from the Infectious Diseases Data Observatory, through their living systematic review of COVID -19 clinical trial registrations and the WHO website, available from https://covid -nma.com/ . 3. Summary of Recommendations Vaccines reduce harm caused by COVID -19 infection and are superior to the treatments listed in this document . Treatments should not be considered as an alternative to vaccination. It is recommended that everyone continue to take precautions to prevent infection with COVID -19. If available and appropriate, advice should be sought from Infectious Disease s or Microbiology colleagues prior to prescribing novel agents for the treatment of COVID -19, and from Respiratory and Critical Care specialists, especially when considering use of remdesivir in patients requiring oxygen via nasal cannula, venture or AIRVO (i.e CRS steroids or tocilizumab. Serology testi ng may be carried out in advance, where locally available, for patients who despite vaccination are unlikely to have generated protective immunity. This should not be viewed as a requirement for treatment at this time . A number of models have been devel oped internationally to categorise COVID -19 disease severity. In Ireland, the HSE National Clinical Programme for Respiratory Medicine/Irish Thoracic Society developed the COVID Respiratory Scale (CRS) (see Appendix 4). EVIDENCE FOR COVID -19 THERAPIES The strongest evidence available to date is for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, corticosteroid use and for the use of tocilizumab in rapidly deteriorati ng patients. The evidence base for the novel agents to treat COVID -19, such as Paxlovid (PF- 07321332/ritonavir ) and remdesivir, is limited: These trials were carried out in unvaccinated populations and prior to the emergence and spread of new variants of concern (i.e. omicron) Given the paucity of strong evidence, some clinicians may wish not to prescribe these novel therapies and this is a valid clinical management strategy. This guideline will be updated as further data emerges and matures. HSE Interim Guidance for the Pharmacological Management of Patients with COVID -19.

Use should be restricted to clinical scenarios with po tential for treatment benefit. The T GEC recommends only considering early remdesivir use for patients in Tier 1 and 2 risk groups (Appendix 2) with conditions listed in the Clinical Risk Factor table (Appendix 3) .These cohorts are at the highest risk of severe disease and they are expected to receive the greatest benefit from this early intervention therap y and should be prioritised when supplies are limited. These clinic al conditions may again in the future be restricted to the red conditions only as the supply of COVID -19 therapeutics available in Ireland dictates. Approaching antiviral treatment from a stewardship perspective, as the oral option, Paxlovid (PF- 07321332 / ritonavir) appropriateness should be assessed first. Remdesivir (IV) should be reserved for Tier 1 and Tier 2 patients for whom Paxlovid (PF-07321332/ ritonavir) is not suitable. This is to reduce the strain on hospital resources for administration and to prevent further complications with IV care. Aside from the above, this guidance does not recommend any therapeutic agent over another but suggests that patient specific factors including symptom duration, renal function and drug interactions as well a s product availability should drive choice of therapeutic agent. There is no evidence for the efficacy of combination treatment and this should not be considered. For the purposes of this document, the following terminology will be used: Unvaccinated : meaning COVID -19 vaccination schedule not commenced or incomplete. Vaccinated: meaning COVID -19 vaccine primary series completed with or without a booster dose administered HSE Interim Guidance for the Pharmacological Management of Patients with COVID -19.

Risk assessment and provision of appropriate VTE prophylaxis and patient information is recommended for all patients hospitalised with COVID -19. Refer to S ection 4 .5 for further information 4. Available Therapies The authors of this guidance observe in general that, the decision to treat a patient should be at the medical opinion of the individual clinician and in discussion with a multidisciplinary team and/or colleagues and that the treatment options be discussed with the patient. It is not mandatory to apply these suggestions. The guideline does not override the responsibility of the clinician to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient. Some of the Covid -19 treatments are newly licensed medications, being used for unlicensed indications or unlicensed. Many of them are subject to additional monitoring as the clinical evidence base is less well developed . Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system and HPRA Pharm acovigilance website ( www.hpra.ie ). This will allow early identification of new safety signals and further inform the safe and e ffective use of these medicines . The incident and all actions taken must be recorded and the relevant National Incident Management Report Form (NIRF) completed as soon as is practicable after the event occurs and within one working day. National Incident Report form can be found here https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/nqpsd/qps - incident -management/nims/ . Healthcare professionals should refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics and drug -drug interaction databases (e.g. Stock ley's Interaction Checker) to check for drug -drug interactions.

Non -ICU Patients Hospitalised patients not requiring admission to an ICU should be considered for treatment with parenteral cortico ste roids (dexamethasone or hydrocortisone) for the first 48 hours followe d by a review to oral therapy. ( Expert Opinion of Therapeutic Guideline Group ) Pregnancy Recommendations Should be reviewed on a case by case basis. Please see se ction 5 below. Paediatric Recommendations* Corticosteroids, in addition to supportive care, should be considered for children with severe or critical COVID -19. This decision should be made following discussion with paediatric Infectious Diseases in CHI. Dexamethasone 15 0 micrograms/kg IV or PO (maximum 6mg) once daily for 10 days7 Additional Information This guidance does not apply to the use of systemic corticosteroids for indications other than COVID -19 (e.g. exacerbations of asthma or COPD). Patients with COVID -19 who are receiving corticosteroids must be monitored for adverse effects (e .g. hyperglycaemia, secondary infections; see Summary of Product Characteristics for full information on adverse events ). It would be prudent to monitor glucose levels in patients with severe and critical COVID - 19, regardless of whether the patient is known to have diabetes. Consideration needs to be given to the need for appropriate gastro -protection according to local hospital policy. Suspected co -infection with pathogens other than COVID -19 should be investigated and treate d empirically as per local antimicrobial policy with consideration of the principles of antimicrobial stewardship HSE Interim Patients with COVID -19.

For patients prescribed systemic corticosteroids at the time of hospital admission, the dose should be increased to a dose therapeutically equ ivalent to that detailed in the recommended dose sche dule s above . Corticosteroid anti -inflammatory dose equivalencies8 are: Once the course of treatment with systemic corticosteroids indicated for COVID 19 is complete d, asse ss clinical need to recommence the previous corticosteroid prescription. *While acknowledging a lack of substantial evidence for their use, the WHO recommends the addition of systemic corticosteroids in the care of children and adolescents (aged between 0 - 18) who fit the diagnostic criteria of Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome (PIMS) and Kawasaki disease. The rationale for this advice results from the outcome that the potential harms of systemic corticosteroids were fewer than the potential benefits of their use in this population9.

Method of Administration Please see the t ocilizumab Funding Hospital Additional Information HSE guidance for the use of tocilizumab in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting is informed by the REMA P - CAP2,4,5 trial which demonstrates benefit with the use of tocilizumab, in combination with syste mic corticosteroids and standard of care, in critically ill patients with COVID -19 receiving organ support (respiratory or cardiac) in an ICU. HSE guidance for the use of tocilizumab in the non -ICU setting is inf ormed by results from the RECOVERY3 , 5 study. Results from the RECOVERY study demonstrated benefit in a subset of hospitalised patients with severe COVID -19 outside of the ICU setting who demonstrate evidence of progressive COVID -19 characterised by an infl ammatory phenotype (CRP to and hypoxaemia (oxyge n saturation less than 92% on air or requiring oxygen therapy). Use of tocilizumab outside of the ICU setting should only be considered after consultant -level discussion in a multidisciplinary setting that includes at least two consultants from critical care medicine, haematology, infection specialists, or respiratory medicine, and with patient engagement (or their relevant person, by phone). Tocilizumab should not be adminis tered if there is a concurrent untreated severe active infection other than COVID -19. There may be a risk of reactivation of latent infections (e.g., hepatitis B virus, and tuberculosis) .1 Patients should be monitored for hepatotoxicity and haematolo gical abnormalities.

Provision of appropriate prophylaxis and patient informati on is recommended for all patients , (unless contraindicated ) with COVID -19 admitted to hospital. Refer to the HSE COVID 19 Interim Clinical Guidance for VTE protocol and Patient Information for Acute Hospitals1 https://hse -ie.libguides.com/c.php?g=6 79077&p=4866382 5. Pregnancy and Treatments used in COVID -19 Vaccination remains the most effective method of preventing severe COVID -19 disease in pregnancy. Pregnant women appear no more or less likely to contract COVID -19 than the general population1. At present, t he approach to prevention, evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of pregnant women with suspected COVID -19 should be similar to that in non -pregnant individuals. The priority for medical care should be to stabilise the woman's condition with sta ndard therapies.1 As highlighted in multiple maternal death enquiries from Ireland and the UK, pregnant or postpartum women with medical problems should not be denied investigations and treatment because they are pregnant or breastfeeding and should be tre ated the same as non -pregnant women unless there is a clear contra - indication.2 The management of pregnant women with acute respiratory infection with COVID -19 should be in line with national guidance for non -pregnant patients, as detailed in the main bod y of this document. The use of pharmacological agents in the treatment of COVID -19 should only be used in a pregnant patient if the potential risk of maternal infection with COVID -19 is considered to be greater than any potential or unknown risks to the mo ther or the foetus from the drug. If treatment is indicated, p regnant and postpartum women should not be excluded from clinical trials unless there is a clear contra - indication.2 The use of pharmacological agents outside of a clinical trial should balance the limited evidence of the safety of these agents in pregnancy with the uncertain efficacy. If treatment is being considered outside of a clinical trial, it must only be initiated after consultant -level discussion with multidisciplinary input with from re levant specialities, including Infectious Diseases / Microbiology / Obstetrics / Respiratory and patient engagement. Seek pharmacy advice on available products, choice of agent, and potential drug -drug interactions.

The RECOVERY trial protocol for pregnancy patients recommended oral prednisolone or IV hydrocortisone, inste ad of are extensively metabolised in the placenta with minimal transmission to the foetus.1 The decision to use systemic corticosteroids in pregnant patients with COVID -19 should be a shared decision involving a multidisciplinary approach and the patient, and should be considered separate to the administration of antenatal steroids to promote fetal lung maturity. Oral Paxlovid (PF-07321332 /ritonavir) There is no evidence f or the use of nirmatrelvir/ ritonavir in pregnancy. Patients should be reviewed on a case -by-case basis. Intravenous Remdesivir - Antiviral Extremely limited information is available on the use of remdesivir in human or animal pregnancy. Nonclinical reprod uctive toxicity studies demonstrated no adverse effect on embryofetal development when remdesivir was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits at exposure that was 4 times the recommended human dose (RHD).4 A randomised controlled trial of remdesivir use in the treatment of EBOLA included 6 women who had a positive pregnancy test (timing of exposure is unreported). No information on adverse pregnancy outcomes is described.5 A number of case reports6-8 and two case series including 179 and 6710 women, have described the use of remdesivir in pregnant women.9, 10 No particular concerns have been reported in relation to the safety of remdesivir in pregnancy; however the absence of data on the use of remdesivir in the first trimester limits these conclusions. The decision to use remdesivir in pregnant patients with COVID -19 should be a shared decision involving a multidisciplinary approach and the patient . 6. Paediatrics and Treatments used in COVID -19 The only proven way to prevent progression to severe COVID -19 in the paediatric population is vaccination. Children have a significantly lower risk than adults of developing severe COVID -19 even when additional risks are present. The numbers who will require targeted therapy will be small. The evidence to date on th e use of these therapies in children is minimal and guidance may change as more data become available. Any decisions to treat children should always be made in consultation with the paediatric ID team at CHI. Unlicensed use of COVID -19 therapies may be considered in children and should always be discussed on a case by case basis with the paediatric infectious disease team at CHI.

Advice for Sotrovimab use in pregnancy - Neutralising Monoclonal An tibody Key points for pregnancy clinical teams: 1. Currently, there are no data on the use of sotrovimab in pregnant women2. Other monoclonal antibodies have been safely used in pregnant women for a variety of conditions.3 Due to its mechanism of action, there is a low theoretical risk to the foetus associated with its use in pregnancy .2,4 2. Sotrovimab can be considered for use in pregnancy in line with the clinical prioritisation framework (Appendix 2) if the potential risk of maternal infection with COVID -19 is considered to be greater than any potential or theoretical risks to the mother or the foetus from the drug. 3. Treatment with sotrovimab in pregnancy should not be withheld on account of pregnancy when a benefit from treatment is perceived by the trea ting clinician(s). 1,3,5 4. Most pregnant women infected with SARS -CoV-2 will be either asymptomatic or have mild to moderate disease. Severe disease appears to be more common in later pregnancy.1 5. There is data suggesting that COVID -19 infected pregnant women have a higher risk of severe disease and a higher instance of mortality and morbidity, including higher rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and higher needs for ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), compared to COVID -pregnant women.1 o There is pre-omicron data suggesting that among pregnant women, those who have COVID -19 have : o higher instance of mortality and morbidity compared to pregnant women who do not have COVID -19.6 o increased risk of preterm birth and s mall for gestational age. Babies born to women with COVID -19 in pregnancy are more likely to be admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).6 o worse maternal outcomes, including an increased risk of death .6 Approximately 100,000 babies have been bo rn in Ireland throughout the COVID -19 period.7 The TAG Pregnancy Subgroup are not aware of any maternal deaths to date from COVID -19 throughout the period. However, between 27/06/21 and 22/01/22 (waves 4 and 5) 38 pregnant or recently pregnant women with C OVID -19 were admitted to ICU (representing 39% of COVID ICU admissions among females aged 15-44 years).8 o approximately doubled risk of stillbirth.9 Since January 2021, there have been cases of COVID -19 placentitis in Ireland, result ing in 6 cases of stillb irth and one HSE Interim Guidance for the Pharmacological Management of Patients with COVID -19.
