Palliative care is not synonymous with hospice or end- of-life care. Rather, palliative care addresses the spectrum of care for serious illness from diagnosis through terminal stages of diseases. Moreover, palliative care does not necessarily entail withholding or curbing treatment. Relief of symptoms, enhancing quality of life, and many other specific aspect s of goal - concordant care may, in fact, involve optimal medical or surgical treatment of diseases. The expected outcome of integrating palliative care into the management of the patient's disease is a better quality of life, a realistic understanding of risks and benefits of treatment and interventions, and medical treatment decisions that align with the patient's goals, preferences, and 48NIH Funding Opportunities SPIN ID Program Title Sponsor Name Sponsor Number Deadline Date Funding Amount NIH Funding Opportunities Due: May 2021 values.

Furthermore, in most cases the impact of genetic variation on severity of disease and treatment outcomes remains unknown. Therefore, the NHLBI has recently created the Trans Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program, which aims to utilize high throughput omics to characterize a variety of HLBS diseases. TOPMed is well on its way to collec ting whole genome sequence from over 130,000 well-phenotyped individuals and is currently generating high -throughput expression and other \"omics\" data (e.g. RNA, DNA methylation, metabolites, and proteins) from many of these individuals to complement whole genome sequence information. Having produced an unprecedented volume of high -throughput data, TOPMed now seeks to turn its attention to effectively leveraging this resource through novel systems biology analyses to uncover disease pathobiology.

Critical advances in the treatment of brain disorders in human populations are hindered by our lack of ability to monitor and manipulate circuitry in safe, minimally -invasive ways. Clinical intervention with novel cell and circuit specif ic tools will require extensive focused research designed to remove barriers to delivery of gene therapies. In addition to identification and removal of barriers, the need to specifically target dysfunctional circuitry poses additional challenges. Neurosci ence has experienced an impressive influx of exciting new research tools in the past decade, especially since the launch of the BRAIN Initiative. However, the majority of these cutting- edge tools have been developed for use in model organisms, primarily rodents, fish and flies. These cutting- edge tools, such as viral delivery of genetic constructs, are increasingly adaptable to larger mammalian brains and more importantly are emerging as potential human therapeutic strategies for brain disorders. A pressing need to develop tools for use in large brains or those that are more directly relevant to the human brain is the focus of this initiative. The initiative will support initial proof of principle studies aimed at d emonstrating the feasibility of this approa ch in humans and other mammalian species (non -human primate [NHP]/sheep/pigs).

This activity has launched a series of new research programs designed to elucidate \"minimal rules\" (building a synthetic cell), \"rules of complexity\" (epigenetics), and \"rules of interaction\" (microbiome). This Understanding the Rules of Life: Emergent Networks (URoL:EN) solicitation adds to those previous foundational activities to now understand \"rules of emergence\" for networks of living systems and their environments. Emergent networks describe the interactions among organismal, environmental, social, and human -engineered systems that are complex and often unexpected given the 310National Science Foundation (NSF) Funding Opportunities SPIN ID Program Title Sponsor Name Sponsor Number Deadline Date Funding Amount National Science Fou ndation (NSF) Funding Opportunities: May 2021 behaviors of these systems when observed in isolatio n. The behavior of emergent networks of living systems depend on, but are not wholly predicted by, chemical and physical principles and unit-level biological properties (molecule/cell/organism/population), as well as communication and information flows amo ng nodes in the network. Networks of living systems are reciprocally coupled with natural, built, and social environments in ways that are complex and difficult to predict. The often -unanticipated outcomes of these interactions can be both wide -ranging and enormously impactful. Prediction is further hampered by accelerating perturbations within evolving environments and the associated increase in the frequency of previously rare or extreme events. Determining the emergent properties of these networks, which arise from complex and nonlinear interactions among the different systems that in isolation do not exhibit such properties, is a critical and unsolved problem. One of many examples of this could include the emerging network of interactions across scales that arose from the arrival of the nonnative pathogen, Cryphonectria parasitica, or Chestnut blight, introduced with nursery stock. This pathogen effectively eliminated a dominant overstory tree species, American chestnut (Castanea dentata), across North America and had concomitant impacts on and feedbacks between biotic, abiotic, and social networks. For example, the economic impacts of this pathogen ranged from local agricultural and social impacts to global scale im pacts on the timber industry. Successful projects of the URoL:EN program are expected to use convergent approaches that explore emergent network properties of living systems across various levels of organizational scale and, ultimately, contribute to understanding the rules of life through new theories and reliable predictions about the impact of specific environmental changes on behaviors of complex living systems, or engineerable interventions and technologies based on a rule of life to address associated outcomes for societal benefit. The convergent scope of URoL:EN projects also provides unique STEM education and outreach possibilities to train the next generation of scientists in a diversity of approaches and to engage society more generally. Hence, the URoL:EN program encourages research projects that integrate training and outreach activities in their research plan, provide convergent training opportunities for researchers and students, develop novel teaching modules, and broaden participation of under -represented groups in science. The URoL:EN Program will support projects with a total budget of up to $3,000,000 and an award duration of up to 5 years. 102254 Future Manufacturing (FM) (Defunct) National Science Foundation 21-564 14-May -2021 Not Specified Contact Name William Olbricht Contact Telephone 703-292-4842 Contact Email wolbrich@nsf.gov Sponsor Website Link to sponsor website Program URL Link to program URL 311National Science Foundation (NSF) Funding Opportunities SPIN ID Program Title Sponsor Name Sponsor Number Deadline Date Funding Amount National Science Fou ndation (NSF) Opportunities: May 2021 Deadline Dates (ALL) 14-May -2021 Synopsis The global manufacturing ecosystem has evolved dramatically in recent decades, driven by forces of technology and globalization and steered by the pursuit of greater efficiencies at scale.

The goal of Future Manufacturing is to support fundamental research and education of a future workforce to overcome scientific, technological, educational, economic and social barriers in order to enable new manufacturing capabilities that do not exist today. Future Manufacturing will require major advances in technologies and algorithms for the synthesis and production of new materials, chemicals, devices, components and systems of assured quality with high yield at reasonable cost. It will require new advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, new cyber infrastructure, new approaches for mathematical and computational modeling, new dynamics and control methodologies, new ways to integrate systems biology, synthetic biology and bioprocessing, and new ways to influence the economy, workforce, human behavior, and society. Future Manufacturing requires creative convergence approaches in science, technology and innovation, empirical validation, and education and workforce development to address pressing challenges for manufacturing.
