Published on http://www.mdguidelines.com 3 Strength of Evidence Ratings Strength of Ev idence ratings are used to designate the quality and amount of evidence that supports a specific guideline recommendati on, when taking into account the entire body of relevant evidence found in t he literature search. The body of evidence on a topic consists of all studies found that were relevant to the specific clini cal question and of acceptable quality. In general, the highest quality of evidence found should be used by the Panel as the basis f or the guideline recommendation, unless other factors, such as the potential for harm, ar e an overriding consideration. When multiple studies of similar quality and relevance are f ound on a topic, these studies should be evaluated as a group; if results ar e generally consistent , they would be considered either Strong Evidence (for high quality studies) or Moderate Evidence (for moderate quality studies). In all cases, the rationale for each recommendation and scientific studies used as evidence, shou ld be d ocumented by the Panel. A Strong evidence -base : Two or more high -quality studies.1 B Moderate evidence -base : At least one high -quality study or multiple moderate -quality studies2 relevant to the topic and the working population. C Limited evidence -base : At least one study of moderate quality. I Insufficient Evidence : Evidence is insufficient or irreconcilable. For tr eatment, the criteria used by evidence reviewers to categori ze the quality of individual randomized controlled trials as high, m oderate , or low quality are: adequate randomization, concealed treatment allocation, baseline cohort comparability, patient blin ded, provider blinded, assessor blinded, controlled for co -interventions, compliance acceptable, dropout rate acceptable, timing of asse ssments equivalent, data analyzed by intention to treat, and lack of bias.3 Each criterion receive s a score of 0, 0.5, o r 1. See Table B in the Methodology for a definition of each criterion and scoring level. Studies are considered of low quality if they are rated 3.5 or less, moderate quality if they are rated 4 -7.5, and high quali ty if they are rated 8 - 11. Please see https://info.mdguidelines.com/wp -content/uploads/2019/08/Methodology -2017 - Update.pdf for our full methodology. 1 For therapy and prevention, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with narrow confidence intervals and minimal heterogeneity. For diagnosis and screening, cross -sectional studies using independent gold standards. For progno sis, etiology or harms, prospect ive cohort studies with minimal heterogeneity. 2 For therapy and prevention, a well -conducted review of cohort studies. For prognosis, etiology or harms, a well -conducted review of retrospective cohort studies or untreated c ontrol arms of RCTs. 3 van Tulde r M, Furlan A, Bombardier C, Bouter L.

Published on http://www.mdguidelines.com 4 Introduction Note: This guideline and its recommendations were last reviewed and updated on May 8, 2020 . This guideline has undergone extensive peer revie w. However, t he total depth and brea dth of quality literature for the treatme nt of COVID -19 is quite limited. Some of the studies underlying this guideline are particularly fluid due to the pace of change in knowledge . Research data , especially those associated with treatments , are being published prior to peer review. Under normal circumstances, such data would not be considered for an evidence -based guideline. However, t he severity, urgency , and mortality associated with this pandemic do not allow th e luxury of time to await the completion of peer review. The literature will conti nue to be monitored and this guideline will be updated as needed in response to new research reports, changes in prior reports caused by peer review , and any retractions . Novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID -19) is an ac ute respiratory infection caused by a new s train of corona virus. The virus has been named \"SARS -CoV-2\" and the disease it causes has been named \"coronavirus disease 2019\" (abbreviated \"COVID -19\") [1]. Because it is new, limited but increasing information is available about the virus . The pandemic began in Wuhan, China in October -November 2019 , then expanded markedly throughout t he Wuhan region. The Chinese New Year likely accelerate d the spread of the virus through global travel and hasten ed the development of a pandemic . Quarantines were likely ineffective at preventing the pandemic [2] for several reasons, including the number of undiagnosed, mild, or asymptomatic patients spread ing the virus [3]; animals' susceptibility and involvement ; and the spread of cases in a region prior to the recogni tion of COVID -19 within that area [4]. Public health m anagement of th is pandemic has varied across countries and jurisdic tions, typically using various combinations of approaches, including the quarantin e of affected individua ls, contact tracing, isolation, stay-at-home orders, social distancing, mask use, and the closure of non-essential businesses. The pandemic conti nues to provide numerous challenges , including surge prevention and mitigation ; healthcare and first -responder personal protective equipment availability ; COVID -19 diagnostic testing availability , capacit ies, and limit ations ; unique treatment chal lenges and sparse evidence of efficacy ; growing public restlessness with restrictions; and increasing business/economic concerns. Other c orona virus outbreaks have occurred in the past , such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 -04 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 201 2-15 [5, 6]. When a virus mutates or changes, studies must be perform ed to determine the new strain's virulence (i.e., its ability to infect humans ). Based on prior research and experience with coronavirus infections , the origin of this epidemic is thought to be traced to bats near Wuhan, Copyright \u00a92020 Reed Group, Ltd. Published on http://www.mdguidelines.com 5 China. COVID -19's SARS -CoV-2 virus can now be found in humans on all continents around the world except Antarctica [7, 8] . Virus Char acteristics Contagiousness COVID -19's SARS -CoV-2 virus appears to be more contagious than the prior coronaviruses. There are increasing concerns that the virus is not only spre ad by hand -to-eye contact and respiratory droplets, but also by respiratory aerosols. Aerosols can remain suspended in the air for a longer ti me and well beyond the commonly quoted 6 -foot physical distanc ing guideline [9]. The c ontagiousness and virulence of the SARS -CoV-2 virus appear s to be about 3 -fold greater than that of influenza. Estimates of the contagiousness or transmission rate without interventions (e.g., physical distancing ) range from 2.0 to 3.9 \u2014that is, 2 to 3.9 new cases arise from each known case [10], which is far higher than typical influenza transmission rate of ~1.3 [11]. The severity of COVID -19 is estimated to be approximately 10 -fold higher than that of typical seasonal influenza [12]. More precise estimates of transmission rates will only become known with time , particularly as vi ral testing rates escalate. Future studies will need to quantify factors such as how many people become infected when they are close to someone with the virus, how many asymptomatic cases occur , how many clinical infections occur , and how many fatalities o ccur. The virus 's survivability on surfaces varies depe nding on the material; it has been estimated to survive up to 9 days [13]. The total viable viral counts decline with time [9]. The survival time of the virus was reported to differ by surface type, with approximate upper limits of det ection being 4 hours on copper, 24 hours on cardboard , 48 hours on stainless steel , and 72 hours on plastic. [13]. Surviv al of the virus in aerosols i s thought to be at least 3 hours . However , it is still unclear how much virus is needed to infect a human from eith er surfaces or aerosols . Incubation The incubation period is the amount of time that occurs between exposure and the onset of symptoms. The incubation period of the SARS -CoV-2 virus is estimated to be app roximately 5 days [14], with infrequent cases of up to 14 days [8, 15] . Clinical Presentation There are a t least four distinct types or clinical presentatio ns of COVID -19's SARS -CoV-2 virus infections: 1. Asymptomatic or nonspecific infection 2. Upper respiratory tract infection (URI), which also may include gastrointestinal symptoms 3. Lower respiratory tract infecti on, including pneumonia 4. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) Treatments diffe r for each presentation (see Treatment section for more details) . Copyright \u00a92020 Reed Group, Ltd. Published on http://www.mdguidelines.com 6 Symptoms and Signs The s ymptoms of COVID -19 vary but are generally typical of respiratory infections, su ch as fever and cough. COVID -19 symptoms may include the following [16-18]: Fever (low or high grade) (80-88%) Dry cough [8, 19] (63-69%) Loss of appet ite -84% [20]) Fatigue (38 -46%) Sputum -42%) Chest pain or pressure (28-36%) (shortne ss of breath) (19 -35%) Myalgia and/or arthralgia (muscle and joint pain) (15 -33%) Sore throat (12 -14%) Headache (11 -15%) Chills ( 6-11%) Nausea or vomiting -10%) Diarrhea Nasal congestion taste ) (85% moderate/severe or anosmic) [22] Cardiovascular symptoms and signs may al so be noted on initial presentation [23-27]. Coagulopathy associated with antiphospholipid antibodies and multiple infarcts have been reported in three elderl y patients with COVID -19 infection and multiple comorbidities [28]. Five patients in New York City, ranging in age from 33 to 49, presented with large vessel strokes as the manifestation of COVID -19 infection [29]. There also have been reports of dermatological such as urticaria , vasculitides, and pityriasis rosea [30-33]. Various neurological stroke -like symptoms have been reported [34-40]. Whil e the prevalence of direct kidney involvement in COVID -19 disease ranges from 3 to 15%, it is a marker for multiple organ failure and seve re disease [41]. Acute kidney injury is th ought to be triggered by cytokine storm. In addition, the ACE2 receptor, essential for viral uptake, is highly express ed on podocytes and tubule epithelial cells. Albuminuria and hematuria have been detected in COVID -19 infection, along with the isolation of viral RNA from urine [42]. Because the symptoms for most patient s are typical of nonspecific respiratory tract infections, they can be difficult to distinguish from other diseases [43, 44] . The disease commonly begin s with mild symptoms for several days, which may readily faci litate its spread to other individuals . A minority of patients then develop more severe symptoms and may require ICU care [45]. These more severe cases of COVID -19 involve additional symptoms that typically accompany pneumonia , such as shortness of brea th. Respiratory problems may further Copyright \u00a92020 Reed Group, Ltd. Published on http://www.mdguidelines.com 7 progress to severe dyspnea , require oxygen supplementation, and develop into acute respirator y distress syndrome ( ARDS ). Patients with pneumonia may have tissue hypoxia, tachypnea, tachycardia, and crackles on chest exa mination. Severe cases may present with shock and respiratory failure. The virus infection may also cause no symptoms ; however, asymptomatic and pre -symptomatic individuals may still pass the virus to others , who may then develop symptoms [3, 45, 46] . Children tend to be asymptomatic or have milder symptoms, which suggests a mechanism that may accelerate disease transmission throughout the population [45]. However, a pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome h as been reported in 50 children who present ed with persistent fever and features of Kawasaki disease or toxic shock in New York Ci ty. Most of those patients tested positive for the COVID -19 virus or for antibodies to the virus, suggesting a post - infection immune response. None of the children have died, but several have required mechanical ventilation [47]. Presymptomatic spread has been est imated to account for 44% of secondary cases during a period of community case finding and quarantining [3]. Mortality The mortality rate is estimated to be 0.1-0.5% when including minimally symptomatic and asymptomatic cases , which is modestly abov e the typical seasonal influenza rate (~0.1%) . The mortality rate is highly related to age . For example, the 1.3% fatality rate for patients in their 50s increases to 15% for patie nts in their 80s . The mortality rate for males is 57-64% higher than that for females . Nursing home residence is a particular ly potent risk [48-52]. The risk of severe disease and/or death is also correlated with other underlying conditions , such as heart disease, hypert ension, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal disease, dialysis, liver di sease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] , smoking, and obesity [53-56]; however, approximately 1% of fatalities occur in previous ly healthy patients [57]. Past outbreaks of coron avirus infections had considerably higher mortality rates: 34% for MERS and 10% for SARS . However, the mortality rate is not the only factor in determining the seriousness of a disease; a high rate of infectivity and/or easy transmissib ility could result i n many more total deaths despite a lower case fatality rate. Business Considerations The a ctions an employer can take to m itiga te the risk of COVID -19 infection center primarily on the virus's potential respiratory and contact spread. There are multiple domains for an employer 's actions . Please see the fol lowing sections on: 1. Employee issues (e.g., education and medical surveillance ) 2. Travel issues 3. Social distancing methods 4. Disinfection practices and contact spread measures 5. Personal protective equipment (e.g., masks, gloves , and face shields ) 6. Ventilation issu es 7. Policies and procedures 8. Industry -specific recommendations Copyright \u00a92020 Reed Group, Ltd. Published on http://www.mdguidelines.com 8 The e ducatio n of workers in each of these areas is advised as appropriate. (Note : Always check for current guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .) Employe e Issues COVID -19 surve illance Employers are recommended to implement a surveillance system that at minimum includes education of workers and screening to avoid having workers with potential COVID symptoms enter the workplace premises. Options for larger employers and/o r jobs w ith greater risks (e.g., mission -critical jobs; a workforce where one ill worker could infect an essential group of workers , which would shut down the workplace ) include either daily/ periodic electronic questionnaires and/or temperature measurement s. Diagnost ic testing should be performed on those with symptoms , most commonly through the local healthcare or public health systems . Diagnostic testing may also be performed to ascertain asymptomatic spread , especially among essentia l work ers. Considerat ions also include providing communications and expectations to subcontractors, suppliers , and others who may have significant interactions with the employer (e.g., assurance of policies to address symptomatic employees, surveillance) . Empl oyees with possi ble COVID symptoms Sick employees (including those with minimal symptoms) should stay home from work , as it is important to eliminate all contact between the healthy workers in the workplace and anyone with potentially infectious symptoms [58]. If there is believe d to be COV ID-19's SARS -CoV-2 virus transmission in the area (currently true of essentially all US urban and many rural areas) , then anyone with even mild symptoms of a respiratory tract infection (e.g., cough, fever, fatigue) should sta y home to be sure they do not progress to a clear, readily transmissible, and potentially severe COVID -19 infection [45], as well as to prevent transmission to others. Sick employees should also be encouraged to undergo testing if available. They s hould be instructed to call a provi der or healthcare organization in advance , discuss the symptoms, seek testing if available (especially at outdoor tents), and put on a mask prior to entering any clinic or hospital. Any questions about potential COVID -19 infections sho uld be directed to t he local health department, which has the expertise and personnel to investigate outbreaks and perform contact tracings (provided they are not over whelmed by the current epidemic). It is important to recognize that return -to-work recommendations for essent ial workers, especially healthcare workers, may need to be modified during the course of the epidemic for practical reasons in response to acute wo rkforce shortages in key jobs and sectors. What to d o if an employee tests positive for COVID -19 The sick em ployee should follow current CDC guidelines, quarantining at home (if able). A symptom -based approach recommends recording temperatures twice d aily until 72 hours (3 days) have passed with out fever or treatment with any fever -reducing medications. A minimu m Copyright \u00a92020 Reed Group, Ltd. Published on http://www.mdguidelines.com 9 of 7 days must have passed since the onset of symptoms. A testing -based approach requires two negative PCR viral tests obtained at least 24 hours apart. The areas where the sick employee worked, including conference rooms and common areas, should undergo deep cleaning and decontamination to prevent spread to other em ployees. Employee s in contact with an infected coworker Employees in contact with a n infected coworker should continue to undergo medical screening . Risk assessment should include the durati on of contact with the sick employee , whether they were using any personal protectiv e equipment, and the type of personal protective equipment used (e.g., cloth face covering vs. respirator) [59]. Attempt to maintain confidenti ality regarding an ill employee's identity. Employers may wish to apply more or less restrictive policies depending on their individual business requirements, organizational characteristics (e.g., closeness and numbers of othe r workers), and risk tolerance s. For higher risk exposures with greater business considerations, the most conservative approach is to have employees who could be in the incubation stage work from home for at least 2 weeks after the possible exposure. Yet, in certai n manpower shortage situa tions, medical centers and critical service workers are being allowed to work while asymptomatic with twice -daily temperature checks, self - surveillance for symptoms, social distancing, disinfection of work spaces, and consistent ma sk- wearing instead of bei ng quarantined for 14 days [60]. This option is controversial and not without considerable risks as pre -symptomatic spread is believed to be a primary source of epidemic spread. This option shou ld be carefully weighed b etween the industry sector, criticality of the job, job requirements , and risks of an infectious individual in that particular workplace. This option is likely unduly risky if the workforce or work group is mission critical. High -Risk E mployee Issues For the purposes of these recommendations, high -risk individuals have any of the following conditions [61]: Age 65 years and older Chronic lung disease, including moderate to severe ast hma Serious heart condition (e.g., history of heart attack or heart failure) Immunocompromised (e.g., having had bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS ; using corticosteroids or other immune - modulating medications , undergoing cancer treatment) Smoking Obesity , especially severe Diabetes mellitus Chronic kidney disease, especially those undergoing dialysis Liver disease Hypertension Copyright \u00a92020 Reed Group, Ltd. Published on http://www.mdguidelines.com 10 Generally, the risks associated with the above conditions are greater as the severi ty of the conditions increase. The presence of multiple conditions likely further increase s risks. Employers should attempt to reduce exposures to higher -risk situations for workers who self- identify as high -risk, while being cognizant of the implications of the Americans with Disabilities Act and amendments . A full - or part -time medical director and medical department may help to interface between the worker and management to effect these risk assessments and potential risk reductions. Examples of reducti ons in exposure include the following : Emphasize distance -based work methods , including tele commuting where feasible Place high -risk in dividuals behind barriers Reduce public -facing work Use personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect from exposure Consider placing high -risk individuals closer to ventilation th at provides fresh air Trave l Issues Travel risks include those associated with travel to and from a site , as well as business conducted at that site s. Risks differ considerably by mode of trans portation , geographic locat ions, and current state of the epidemic in any given locale. Business es need to weigh the value of the travel against the risks associated with that travel. Such valuations should include costs associated with any potential illne ss and the post -trip quarantine period. Caution is advised for all non -essential travel to any locales with outbreaks or community spread in progress , which currently includes most urban and many rural US areas (see map to help wi th other risk consideratio ns: https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ec f6) [62]. Inter natio nal trips are current ly similarly affected , with somewhat increased risk estimates due to the length of the transit. Any trips that can be canceled or postponed should be. Employees returning from, or having traveled through , areas known to hav e COVID -19 infections For employ ees returning from personal or work -related travel, the safest course of action is to self-quarantine and work from home for a minimum of 2 weeks4 and avoid direct contact with other workers [15], especially for travel to higher -risk areas compared with travel by persona l automobile to an unaffected ru ral area . If that worker become s ill, he or she should promptly call a healthcare provider before appearing in a clinic or hospital ( i.e., to arrange which entrance to use, to be given an appropriate type of mask before entering the building). The person s hould also avoid all contact with other people. Wearing a surgical -type mask when ill , such as in t ransit to a healthcare facility , may help to reduce the spread of the virus from the wearer's sneezes or coughs . 4 See data above regarding outlier cases of >14 days for incubation. A company must weigh the risks vs. their risk tolerance. Four weeks is a safer course of action. Copyright \u00a92020 Reed Group, Ltd. Published on http://www.mdguidelines.com 11 Social Distancing Methods The following are some social distancing option s to consider: Work from home when feasible to help improve social distancing. Consider rotating workers between home and work settings to reduce workplace population densities while facilitating functions that are best to be performed at work to continue. Improve social distancing at work (e.g., increase distances between workers, install temporary barriers, mark 6 -foot distances on the floor between co -work ers). Consider either social spacing in cafeterias, closing cafeterias and offer ing individual prepac kaged meals , and/or having workers eat their own food at their work stations . Consider one -way walkways where there are two options for walki ng through a workplace . Reorganize shifts to spatially - and temporally -spread workers. Route shifts of workers to enter through one entrance that is a different entrance than that being used to exit the premises. Provide protection for those who interact with the general public (e.g., install temporary barriers to prevent respiratory transmission, install barriers to ph ysically require social distancing of 6+ feet ). Consider discourag ing carpooling and mass transit, or encourag ing the use of masks if using either of those options . Minimize reasons for external individuals and the public to enter a workplace (e.g., curbsi de deliveries, web -based meetings ). If there are multiple options for meetings onsite, attempt to limit which rooms are used and h ave them cleaned af ter every use. Disinfection Practices and Contact Spread Measures The following disinfection practices may help to slow spread by contact : Train staff on how to disinfect workplaces Clean commonly touched worksite surfaces frequently (e.g., hourly or between shifts ), includ ing machine controls, door handles, bathroom doors , bathroom fixtures , faucet handles, lunch tabletops, breakrooms, etc. Consider propping open bathroom and other doors to reduce handling or touching . Avoid shared equipment when possible (e.g., keyboards), and clean common surfaces between shifts or between worker usage. Clean surfaces wi th an EPA -approved virucidal agent and follow manufacturer's instru ctions for use. include agents containing 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite for at least 1 minute [13], although some agents will require longer contact times. It is important to allow sufficient time for sanitizing agents to work, and directions should be carefully followed. The EPA has a list of products active against human coronavirus , with recommendations for the duration of contact time [63]. Encourage frequent hand hygiene (han d washing or use of alcohol -based hand disinfectants) with appropriate technique s [64]. Copyright \u00a92020 Reed Group, Ltd. Published on http://www.mdguidelines.com 12 Provide ample hand sanitizer and hand -sanitizer stations . Personal Protective Equipment PPE measures (masks, gloves, and face shields) are lower on the list of controls, but still may help to slow spread of the COVID virus an d includ e the following : Have health y individuals wear a face covering or mask, as there is evidence of COVID - 19's SARS -CoV-2 virus spreading by asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals [65, 66]. Use face shields , especially w here there is potential for human -related splashes or droplet exposures. Follow OSHA guidance regarding requirements for fit testing of PPE and to assure proper use, donning , and doffing [67, 68] . Appropriate PPE for cleaning a work space contaminated by the virus is thought to normally be a face mask and gloves. If there are concerns about aerosols (e.g., an infected worker was in the room, especially with coughing, sneezing , and/or for an extended time) , an option may be to le ave the roo m overnight befo re cleaning it ; otherwise , an N95 mask would ideally be recommended (P100 is not an appropriate mask for these purposes) . Ventilation Issues Ventilation issues (general and local) have been underutilized as potential COV ID cont rols. Local ventilation can provide a relative ly safe zone for worker s: Use local ventilation to supply clean air to a worker's workspace Utilize increase d air exchanges in the HV AC system to dilute the genera l ambient air (including HEPA filters in the HV AC system). Where possible, use portable air purification systems for small work areas. Polic ies and Procedures The following are potential policies and procedure s to consider: Inform and seek authorization for the plan from the organization's leadership . Develop a plan in conjunction with occupational health and safety professionals, government regulations, and public health authori ties (including CDC). Ensure aff ected workers have sufficient paid leave to observe a quarantine period or are able to stay home as indicated . Continue to monitor sickness absen ce, but expand sick leave provisions to allow employees to stay at home if ill and to care for sick family memb ers. Educate and p lace posters throughout workplace to remind employees to avoid touch ing their eyes, nose, and/or mouth with unwashed hands (e.g., CDC poster) [69]. Teach workers to use tissues to catch a cough or sneeze, then throw that tissue away and wash their hands . Copyright \u00a92020 Reed Group, Ltd. Published on http://www.mdguidelines.com 13 Avoid scheduled aggre gate meetings and e ncourage physical distancing within group settings, ideally a distance of at least 6 feet [70]. Encourage use of teleconferences and/or other virtual meeting formats. Encourage early reporting of any symptoms consisten t with COVID -19 to the medical department, designated employer representa tive, and/ or supervisor , following the company's established policies . Place posters prominently to help remind workers of procedures (e.g., CDC posters). Have employees who develop symptoms stay away from the workplace until clinically evaluated and/or un til the symptoms are resolved . Consider having employees who could be in the incubation stage work from home for at least 2 weeks after the possible exposure . In certain man power shortage situations, medical centers and critical service workers are being allowed to work while asymptomatic with twice -daily temperature checks, self-surveillance for symptoms, and consistent mask -wearing instead of being quarantined for 14 days. However, this may not be compatible with mission -critical operations (e.g., dispat ch center; air traffic control tow er). If there is a confirmed case in your workplace, have the worker identify his or her most common cont acts in collaboration with public health officials while attempt ing to maintain confident iality . Using business risk tolerance procedures, identify wheth er any further action s are required other than increased monitoring (see above) and increased cleaning and disinfection of commonly u sed areas. Antibody testing is becom ing available , but the sensitivity and specificity vary greatly between kits . Their usefulness is limited in areas where the prevalence of disease is around 1 to 3%, and, in this setting and even with 95% specificity, t he majority of positive tests will be false positives. With further validation, antibod y testing may likely become useful in assessing possible susceptibility to infection v ersu s protective response to prior infection. Currently , however, antibody te sting is not able to provide that information and cannot be reliably used for that purpose. I n the future, COVID -19 serology can determine infection risk in critical and susceptible populations (under medical direction to ensure proper implementation, interpretation, and manag ement) . Examples of t hese critical populations include employees in heal th care settings, on oil drilling platforms, commercial maritime, food preparation, cruise lines, airlines, and assembly lines with workforces working closely together. Provide proacti ve assistance to support mental health for the workforce. Identif y and t rain workplace coordinators who will be responsible for implementing and monitoring the plan. Industry -Specific Recommendations Below are select industry guidelines , which are in ad dition to the general guidance above. Further guidance is available from the CDC [72]. Copyright \u00a92020 Reed Group, Ltd. Published on http://www.mdguidelines.com 14 Restaurants Provide social distancing between tables. Be alert to local ventilation issues that may cause dow nwind exposures beyond 6 feet. Menus shoul d be either di sposable or laminated and sanitized after each customer contact. Clean and disinfect chairs and tables after each customer use (see Disinfection) . Assign high -risk employees with multiple co -morbidities or concerns to low -exposure areas, such as working i n non-customer -facing areas as much as possible. Wear protective masks while in the restaurant and kitchen. When possible, d esignate non -high -risk employees to bus tables. Housekeeping in public areas should ideally be performed by lower -risk employees. Encourage drive -through and carry out options to promote social distancing. Retail When possible, p referentially assign low -risk employees to cashiering and other customer -facing work. Stocking by high -risk individuals should ideally be done when custome rs are not present. Returns that cannot be disinfected should best be handled by low -risk employees. Clothing from dressing rooms should ideally be restocked by lo w-risk employees. Housekeeping in public areas should ideally be assigned to lower -risk employe es. Limit total number of customers within enclosed dwellings or structures at one time to allow for social distancing. Encourage customers to use personal respiratory protection and provide PPE to customers where feasible. Hospitality Eliminate h andling of luggage and other customer items. Otherwise, use gloves.

Food Production Facilities These have been hot spots of virus infection due to structural and socioeconomic challenges in meat and poultry proces sing facilities. Difficulties to ove rcome include workers speaking many different primary languages, an incentive to work while ill as a result of limited medical leave and disability policies, and attendance bonuses that could encoura ge working while sick . At home, many workers live in crow ded, multigenerational settings and may share transportation to and from work, increasing risk for transmission of disease [71]. Recommended potential changes in facility practice include the following : Adjust star t and stop times of breaks and shifts, add outdoor breakrooms. Avoid en masse movements of workers . Instal l physical barriers between workers. Copyright \u00a92020 Reed Group, Ltd. Published on http://www.mdguidelines.com 16 Screen all workers an d visitors, isolate workers who become ill at work.

Provide additional medical leave and disability benefits ; remove attendance bonuses. More details regarding business concerns are available from the CDC [72]. Disability and Return -to-Work Considerations Disability will be better def ined with studies over time. Extrapolat ion using recovery from other conditions , such as ARDS , may provide some preliminary estimates . Return -to-work ev aluations should consider the worker's current status as compared with the physical requir ements of the job, mental demands of the job, safety -critical work functions, current treatments, use of impairing medication, residual effects of the virus, requirem ents for personal protective equipment, potential risk to others if returned too early , and protect ion of other employees if additional risk is identified. Many of these complex cases will need to be addressed by occupational and environme ntal medicine physicians. Currently, for patients without hospitalization, there are no quality data on return ing to work , short -term disability, or long -term disability. Regarding short -term disability and return to work, recovery from post -infection fatigue is estimated to take approximately 2 -3 weeks and appears to correlate with clinical duration and severity. For patients with mild to moderate pneumonia treated with oxygen supplementation , recovery is estimated to require 4 -8 weeks after hospitalization or clinical re covery. Severe pneumonia and ARDS have worse prognoses. The overall trajectory of recovery from CO VID-19 remain s unclear . Prior experience with diseases that have similar manifestation s, such as ARDS, suggest there is significant risk of delayed return to work and long -term disability , as approximately 50% of individuals surviving ARDS have not return ed to work after 1 year [73, 74] . ARDS is also associated with approximately 20% reductions in spirometry and lung v olume , which resolve at about 6 months based on prior H7N9 influenza data [75]. Lung diffusion abnormalities can take up to 5 years to resolve in ARDS case s [75, 76] . Cognitive impairmen ts and psychiatric abnormalities related to ARDS may be projected to occur in 30-55% and 40-60% of patients, respectively ; the duration of these impairments is unclear , but other causes of ARDS raise considerable concerns about long -term disability [74-78]. Generalized skeletal mu scle deconditioning is expected in patients who are intubated for any extended duration ; these patients require exercise programs and possibly rehabilitation , which often results in residual inc apacity [74, 77, 79, 80] . Cardiac problems are common with COVID -19, with cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia , and direct ca affecting 30%, 20% , and 10% of patients, respectively [81]. Copyright \u00a92020 Reed Group, Ltd. Published on http://www.mdguidelines.com 17 In general, for patients who are intubated and s urvive, recovery of the cardiorespiratory systems and endurance are estimated to take at least several months . It currently appears likely that some hospital ized and severely affected individuals will incur long -term disability with permanent impairments o f the cardiac , respiratory , neurological , and/or musculoskeletal systems. [74-78]. The p otential for a minority of patients to be permanently totally impaired cannot be excluded [78]. Cardiac , respiratory , and neurological disability measures include: Metabolic stress ECHO Full pulmonary function testin g with impedance booth or washou t testing Functional capacity testing Neuropsychological testing Ratings for impairment can be fou nd in the AMA Guides 5th Edition [82] and 6th Edition [83]. Diagnostic Approach Laboratory Tests COVID -19 has a widely varying clinical presenta tion. Depending on the extent of infection and the organ system s affected, any or all of the following may be found [43, 44, 84]: Lymphopenia (a fairly uniqu e and characteristic finding) Elevated liver enzymes Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) Elevated pancreatic enzymes troponin Elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) markers ferritin) Elevated D -dimer Elevated fibrinog en Elevated creatinine Elevated blood urea nitrogen Hypoxemia Diagnostic Testing COVID -19 diagnostic testing has centered around polymerase chain reaction ( PCR)-based techniques to identify the viru s from nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs [85]. Antibody testing is under developme nt and in early deployment . Because there is no referen ce standard, the determination of test accuracy , sensitivity an d specificity are problematic. Most Copyright \u00a92020 Reed Group, Ltd. Published on http://www.mdguidelines.com 18 of the limited evidence suggests th at nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal sample s are comparable for the first week, but then the nasopharyngeal sample is more sensitive [86, 87] : From days 0 -7, orop haryngeal are for mild/severe disease , respectively . On days 8 -14, oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal sensitivities are approximately 30/50% and 54/72% for mild/severe disease , respectively [88]. These samples and techniques are ba sed on PCR tec hniques , which may or may not reflect active virus shedding . These tests can indicate the RNA debris of coronavirus and may reflect non-viable virus remnants. Work is progressing on the deve lopment of a saliva test for SARS -CoV-2 detection, which is appealing for ease of collection and is not limited by the global shortage of swabs. One study detected higher SARS -CoV-2 titers in saliva compared to nasopharyngeal swabs, with less longitudinal variability [89]. If validated, saliva testing could provide near universal sampling coverage for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients [90]. Importantly, the risks of false -negative and false -positive test results change as a pandemic progresses. For example, as an epidemic progresses and disease becomes more common, individuals who present with symptoms are increasingly most likely to represent false negatives . Thus, o nce an epidemic disease becomes pervasive , diagnostic testin g is often unnecessary for typical cases because it does not materially alter the post -test probability . At an epidemic 's peak, the testing of unusual cases is ideally performed with highly accurate tests, as such cases may represent unusual presentations that should be distinguished from non - COVID -19 causes . Subsequently, because the SARS -CoV-2 virus cause s such a wide spectrum o f disease, from asymptomatic infection to life -threatening infection, along with the possibility of other co -circulating respirat ory viruses (e.g., influenza) , this will make the issue of diagnostics for SARS -CoV-2 one of paramount importan ce for the fore seeable future , particularly in fall- winter 2020 -21 with the anticipation of another epidemic wave (s) at that time . It is a spirat ional that immune status testing (IgG, IgM) will eventually be the most important test for both sho rt-term diagnostic confirmation and longer -term assessment of population - based risk assessments , such as herd immunity. This requires considerable research, inclu ding determinations of sensitivity, specificity, timing, persistence of the immunoglobulins , and whether the immunoglobulins will be associated with true immunity . Theoretically, th is testing may also help designate workers who may more safely interac t wit h the public. If proven, antibody testing may be used to assure a workplace that a previously infected worker is safe to return to work (i.e., that they are not actively infected and unlikely to be shedding virus ). However, the currently available antibody studies have yet to be sufficiently validated on a widespread basis. Inaccuracies are increas ingly reported to be problematic [91, 92] . Once these problems are addresse d, it is anticipate d that antibody testing will become widespread if not universal in many workplaces and other populations of concern (e.g., nursing homes). Copyright \u00a92020 Reed Group, Ltd. Published on http://www.mdguidelines.com 19 Immune status determination, if proven, may be of major importance for workplace populations in m any, if not all , sectors. Workforces with the greatest needs for immune status testing include those w ith isolated populations, risk of transmission to vulnerable populations , high worker densities, and/or distance from and lack of access to appropriate he althcare (e.g., oil platform drilling , commercial maritime , cruise lines, overseas workforces, airline s, rail, trucking, mining). Imaging Although x -rays are usually abnormal for individuals with pulmonary involvement , radiography in general should not be us ed as a standalone screening tool for COVID -19. X-ray abnormalities peak at 10 -12 days after onset of symptoms [43, 93] . One series reported that chest radiographs most commonly show either con solidation (47%) or g round glass abnormalities (33%). The same series noted that 41% were peripheral, 50% were lower dis tribution , and 50% were bilateral [93]. Computerized tomograms performe d [94, opacities One of cases nd glass appeara nce, 12% with consolidation, 12% with crazy paving pattern s, 37% with interlobular thickening, 56% with adjacent pleural thickening , and 61% with linear opacities [44]. Treatment Recommendations Treatment is currently guided by p reliminary studies ; many additional s tudies are und erway . No treatment is indicated for asymptomatic cases or indiv iduals with a URI. The three main classes of interventions for more serious infections are an ti-viral treatments, cytokine storm -reducing agents , and ventilatory support (both non -invasive and invasive) . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) has prov ided emergency approval for , and remdesivir [102] , shown some evidence of efficacy against COVID -19 and are being investigated as possible treatments [103 -125] . The FDA has also provided support for the use o f convalescent plasma antibodies from survivors of COVID -19 through either randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) or expanded use, although it was note d that antibodies are an unproven treatment for COVID -19 [126] . No other medications are currently appro ved for the treatment of COVID -19, although other anti -viral drugs are also under investigation (e.g., lopinavir -ritonavir). A trial of lopinavir -ritonav ir in adults hospitalized with severe COVID -19 did not improve outcomes [127] . The FDA has provided unprecedented flexibility to accelerate the development of new drugs and testing [128] . If individuals develop more severe symptoms or have complications (e.g., ARDS or respiratory failure ), they are primarily treated with non-invasive ventilatory support measures, anti- cytokine storm agents, mechanical venti lation (including prone ventilation) respiratory support measures , and DVT prophylaxis [129] . Evaluations should include exclusion of other causes (e.g., influenza). The use of glucocorticosteroids is contro versial and is generally not advised witho ut other indications [130] . Although multiple agents addressing the cytokine Copyright \u00a92020 Reed Group, Ltd. Published on http://www.mdguidelines.com 20 storm are under investigation, most of the publications are centere d around interleukin -6 (IL -6) [131] . A recent short report described the use of pooled human high -dose polyclonal immunoglobulin G in 3 pat ients with severe COVID -19 pneumonia. Intravenous immunoglobulin was administe red at 0.3 -0.5 g per kg weight per day for 5 days, a dose based on previous use in immune modulation therapy for neuromuscular disorders and autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura. Ther e were no adverse events, and a ll patients clinically improved shortly aft er starting treatment. Their temperature returned to normal in 1 -2 days and breathing difficulties alleviat ed in 3-5 days [132 ]. Thus, trials suggest that in selected patients with severe, COVID -19 pneumonia, tempering an excessive immune response to the virus is associated with clinical improvement. Anti-viral medicat ions may have minimal to no role in advanced pneumonia or AR DS [124] , although they are typically prescribed when at least some viral replication is still ong oing. A potential hierarchical protocol for antiviral treat ment being discussed for COVID -19 is as follows : 1. Remdesivir, h or anti -viral medication, including lopinavir -ritonavir) A potential hierarchical treatment protocol for pneumonia/ARDS (in addition to possible anti - viral treatment) includes the following : 1. Oxygen supplementation 2. Prone positioning (due to shunting) and/or n on-invasive ventilation (NIV) 3. Interleukin -6 inhibition 4. Mechanical ventilation , prone 5. Extracorporeal membrane oxygena tion (ECMO) Mechanical ventilation has been associated with a survival ra te of approximately 30% (and the short - to intermediate -term quality of life of th ose survivors is in considerable doubt) . Thus , the prevention of severe outcomes should be the prima ry treatment emphasis [133, 134] , and there is an increasing emphasis on non invasive ventilatory measures . There is no vaccine for COVID -19 [58]. Vaccine development has begun , but it is estimated to require 12 -18+ months if successf ul [135] . Copyright \u00a92020 Reed Group, Ltd. Published on http://www.mdguidelines.com 21 Hydroxychloroquine for Treatment of COVID -19 Recommended. Hydroxychlor oquine is recomm ended for the supervised treatment of select ed patients with COVID -19. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided emergency approval for the use of hydroxychloroquine [101] . Strength of Evidence - Recommended, Evidence (C) Level of Confidence - Low Indications: Moderate to severely affected patients with COVID -19. For se verely affected patients , azithromycin may be added; how ever, electrocardiogram monitoring (ECG) is advised when adjunctive therapy with agents prolonging the QT interval is considered (see Harms) . The FDA advises against outpatient use due to cardiac concerns. Evidence suggests better efficacy if administered earlier in the clinical course when viral replication is occurring. There is no quality evidence of efficacy after ARDS is established [124] . Use in mild case s could be justified, especially if administered early in the course for a patient with multiple co -morbidities (e.g., pre -diabetes, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, COPD) . However, without a sound rationale and w hen the medication is effectively rationed , use in mild cases appears difficult to support. Benefits: Reduced need for a ventilator or ICU stay. Earlier clearance of pneumonia on CT scan [124] . Harms: Negligible for most patients undergoing short -course use. One RCT reported one patient with rash and one patient with headache , the latter of w hich is a common symptom of the infection [124] . There are concerns about the potential for prolonged c orrected QT intervals , and thus arrhythmias [136, 137] . monito ring is particularly indicated for patients with underlyin g cardiovascular disease, history of prolonged QT, unexplained syncope, family history of premature sudden cardiac death, electrolyte abnormalities, renal insufficiency, and use of other drugs repor ted to prolong QT intervals , including when there is plann ed adjunctive use with azithromycin. Renal insufficien cy also may increase toxicity risks. Retinopathy appears highly unlikely with these short courses , as it has been reported at levels of >100 -fold greater cumulative doses [138] . Frequency/Dose/Duration: Multiple regime ns have been used. There is a mechanistic rationale for the concomitant use of zinc to inhibit viral replication . The following are common regimens , the first of which was used in the one quality RCT: Hydroxychloroquine 200mg BID x 5 days 10 days [106] Hydroxy TID x 10 d ays plus azithromycin 500mg x 1 day then 250mg QD x 4 days [106] Hydroxy chloroqui ne 400mg BID x 1 day, then 00mg BID for 4 days [105] . Hydroxychloroquine 400mg BID x 1 day, then 400mg QD for 4 day. Copyright \u00a92020 Reed Group, Ltd. Published on http://www.mdguidelines.com 22 Hydroxychloroquine 600mg BID x 1 day, then 400mg QD for 4 day. Because the half-life of these medications is long, a loading dose for the first day or two may be preferable. Concomitant treatment with azithromycin for more severe cases has been reported in non - randomized studies as showing efficac y. Rationale: One moderate -quality RCT show ed reduced pneumonia on CT sca n compared with placebo [124] . One moderate -quality study found minimally faster improvements in sym ptoms, lymphopenia , and C - reactive protein ; however, the a verage administration began at 16 -17 days in the treatment course , which was likely after viral replication had largely ceased . Thus, the primary outcome of v iral clearance rate did not exceed that of standard care [139] . There are many in vitro studies sug gesting antiviral activity [104, 105, 111, 115, 117, 125, 140 - 142] . However , although in vitro studies generally show efficacy for a medication to be effective in humans, that is not necessarily a definitive measur e of efficacy in human trials ; such studies have sometimes failed to support treatment in human trials for other diseases [143, 144] . Because t here is quality evidence for the efficacy of chloroquines (especially h ydroxychloroquine ) for the treatment of COVID -19, the medi cations are low cost, and adverse effects are minor for short courses of treatment , these medications are recommended. Based on the available limited evidence, e arlier treatment appears to be import ant for efficacy compared with treatment in an ICU.

Strength of Evidence - Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I) Level of Confidence - Low Indications: This recommendation is primarily based on the evidence for hydroxychloroquine. Moderate to severely affected patients wi th COVID -19.

The following are common regimens, mostly from various national guide lines : Chloroquine phosphate 5 00mg BID x 5 days Chloroquine 600mg QD at diagnosis, then 300mg in 12 hours, then 300mg BID for 5 days Chloroquine 600mg QD x 1 day, then 300mg BID for 5 days Because the half -life of these medications is long, a loading dose for the first day or two may be preferable. Concomitant treatment with azithromycin for more severe cases has been reported in non - randomized studies using hydroxychloroquine as showing efficacy. Copyright \u00a92020 Reed Group, Ltd. Published on http://www.mdguidelines.com 24 Rationale: There are no quality studies of ch loroquine. One moderate -quality RCT of hydroxychloroquine showed reduced pneumonia on CT scan compared with placebo [124] . There are unpublished reports sugge sting efficacy has been demonstrated in trials in China , but these have neither been published in English nor apparently peer -reviewed [117] . There a re many in vitro studies suggesting antiviral activity , which is similar to hydroxychloroquine [105] , thus producing comparable rationale [104, 105, 110, 111, 117, 141, 142] . Still, although in vitro studies generally show efficacy f or a medication to be effective in humans, that is not necessarily a definitive measure of efficacy in human trials; such studies have sometimes failed to support treatment in human tria ls for other diseases [143, 144] .

Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are not recommended for use for widesprea d prophylaxis against COVID -19. Strength of Evidence - Not Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I) Level of Confidence - Low Rationale: There are no quality trials reported, although several are underway. There is rationale that prophylactic use may have sho rt-term efficacy based on suggestive evidence of prophylactic effects in vitro studies [105] . The weaknesses of prophylaxis include that: 1) subsequent waves of this epidemic are possible if not probable; 2) the number of patients with large numbers of virions being exposed to the chloroquines markedly increases the r isks of resistance, which may mean subsequent epidemic waves will be more difficult to treat (assuming efficacy is confirmed in additional stu dies) ; and 3) it is unknown if a subsequent epidemic wave may be less or more virulent. In some instances, current prophylactic use may make some sense, such as in a nursing home where the virus is circulating or in select ed healthcare workers with particu larly high risks . However, for most situations, the potential development of immunity is l ikely preferable, as rescue therapy with one of the chloroquines for more severe cases currently appears possible.

Low-dose CQ: Patients received 450 mg CQ twice daily on day 1 and then once daily for 4 days (n = 40) Follow -up: Follow -up daily for 13 days Results: Overall lethality rate = 27.2%. Lethality up until day 13 was 39.0% in the high -dosage group and 15.0% in the low -dosage group. Lethality was associated with the high -dosage group (OR = 3.6, 95% CI [1.2, 10.6]). After controlling for age , the association was no l onger significant (OR = 2.8 [0.9, 8.5]). Patients receiving high -dosage CQ presented more instances of QTc interval greater than 500 milliseconds when compared to the low -dosage group (18.9 % vs. 11.1%) Conclusion: \"The preliminary findings of this study suggest that the higher CQ dosage should not be recommended for critically ill patients with COVID -19 because of its potential safety hazards, especially when taken concurrently with azithrom ycin and osel tamivir.\" Comments: The trial was stopped due to ca rdiovascular risks in very high dose group . Severe ARDS patients had RR>24 and/or HR>125 and/or O 2<90% and/or shock. Differences at baseline. A very high CQ dose was used both daily (1.2g/d) and cumulativ ely (12 g) while combined with azithromycin. Data suggest excessive doses of CQ combined with azithromycin are associated with irregular heart rhythms.

A larger proportion of improved pneumonia patients occurred in the HCQ group (80.6%) compared with the cont rol group (54.8%). The HCQ g roup's mean body temper ature recovery time was significantly shorter compared to controls (2.2 vs. 3.2 days, respectively, p<0.05). Mean cough remission time was significantly reduced in the HCQ group compared to controls (p<0.0 5). In the control group, 4 patients progressed to severe illness, whereas 0 did in the treatment group. 2 participants developed adverse effects from HCQ (one had a rash, the other had a headache). Conclusion: \"Despite our small number of cases, the pot ential of HCQ in the treatme nt of COVID -19 has been partially confirmed. Considering that there is no better option at present, it is a promising practice to apply HCQ to COVID - 19 under reasonable management. However, large -scale clinical and basic researc h is still needed to clarify its specific mecha nism and to continuously optimize the treatment plan.\" Comments: Included hospitalized patients only. 100% follow -up and no deaths. Modest baseline differences in fever and days of cough may weakly favor HCQ. CT scans included all four objective measures of improvements.

Published on http://www.mdguidelines.com 32 Azithromycin for Treatment of COVID -19 Recommended. Azithromycin is recommended for the adjunctive treatment of select ed patients with more severe COVID -19. Azithromycin has been suggested to inhibit the growth of both the Zika and Ebola viruses, as well as prevent severe lower respiratory tract infections [151 -154] . Strength of Evidence - Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I) Level of Confidence - Low Indications: Adjunctive use with hydroxychloroquine in severely affected patients with COVID -19. For severely affected patients, azit hromycin may be added [106] , but E CG monitoring should be particularly considered when adjunctive therapy wit h agents prolonging the QT interval is considered , including azithromycin plus HCQ/CQ (see Harms). Evidence suggests better efficacy if administered earlie r in the clinical course when viral replication is occurring. There is no quality evidence of efficac y after ARDS is established [124] . Benefits: Theoretical r educed need for a ventilator or ICU stay. Harms: Negligible for most patients undergoing short -course use. There are concerns about the potential for prolonged c orrected QT intervals when used in combination therapy , and thus arrhythmias. ECG monitoring is particularly indicated in those undergoing adjunctive treatment with HCQ/CQ with underlying card iovascular disease, history of prolonged QT, unexplained syncope, family history of premature sudden cardiac death, electrolyte abnormalities, r enal insufficiency, and use of other drugs reported to prolong QT intervals , including when there is planned adj unctive use with hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine . Indications for Discontinuation: Completion of a course, intolerance, adverse effect, prolonga tion of QT interval. Frequency/Dose/Duration: The regimen used for treatment of COVID is azithromycin 500mg on day 1 and then 250 mg/day for 4 days [106, 149] . Rationale: There are no quality studies of azithromycin . One nonrandomized trial suggested improved efficacy when hydroxychloroquine was combined with azithromy cin [106] ; these authors reported similar results in a subsequent, larger case series of 80 cases [149] . There is low -quality evidence for adjunctive use of azithromycin but almost no other anti - viral treatment option, these medications are low cost, and adverse effects are minor for short courses of treatment ; thus, these medications are recommended. Based on the available limited evidence, earlier treatment appears to be import ant for efficacy compared with treatment in an ICU.

Strength of Evidence - No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I) Level of Confidence - Low Rationale: Favipiravir, a guanine analogue to inhibit RNA -dependent RNA polymerase, has been used to treat influenza . One RCT compari ng favipiravir with arbidol found no significant differences in the main clinical outcome measure, although fever and cough resolved more quickly in the favipiravir group [ 146] . There is one non-randomized controlled trial suggesting acceleration of viral clearance compared with lopinavir -ritonavir [155 ]. Although there is no quality evidence of efficacy, th ese studies suggest there may be potential efficacy and thus , while needing further quality data, this medication may be helpful in the treatment of patients with COVID -19.

Lopinavir -ritonavir is not recommended for the treatment of COVID -19. Strength of Evidence - Not Recommended, Evidence (C) Level of C onfidence - Low Rationale: Lopinavir -ritonavir are anti -retroviral protease inhibitors that have been used to treat HIV and have been tr ialed in one open -label RCT , which show ed a lack of efficacy compared with standard care [127] , while another double -blind RCT also suggested lack of efficacy , although it may have been underpowered [157] . One RCT treated severe patients and the other treated mild/moderately severe patients at an average of 4-5 days duration . It is unc lear if the medications would be effective if provided earlier in the clinical course. These medications have also been suggested to be inferior to favipiravir in a non -randomized comparative trial [155] . However , because there are other medication s with evidence of efficacy, lopinavir -ritonavir are not recommended for the treatment of COVID - 19 patients.

Published on http://www.mdguidelines.com 39 Sample Size: N = 47 patients with COVID -19 infection Age/Sex: No mean age given, age range 5 -68 years; 22 males, 25 females Comparison: Lopinavir/ ritonavir (LPV/r) treatment (400/100 mg twice daily or 800/200 mg once daily) with adjuva nt medicine (n=42) vs. No LPV/r t reatment with adjuvant medicine (n=5) Follow -up: Follow -up daily for 10 days Results: Body temperature of LPV/r group was not significantly different than control group (p > 0.05). In those with body temperature of 37.5\u00b0 C at admission, those in LPV/r gr oup returned to a normal body temperature in a shorter time period compared to control (4.8 days vs. 7.3 days, p = 0.0364). Number of days for nCoV -RNA negative result: LPV/r group = 7.8 days, control group = 12.0 days (p = 0.0219) Conclusion: \"We prove t hat the combination treatment of LPV/r and routine adjuvant medicine against pneumonia could produce much better efficacy on patients with COVID -19 infection compared to treatment with adjuvant medicine alone. Hence, we sug gest to widely apply the combinat ion treatment in treatment pat ients with COVID -19 infection.\" Comments: Modest sample size. Efficacy unclear. Copyright \u00a92020 Reed Group, Ltd.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided emergency approval for the use of remdesivir [102] . Strengt h of Evidence - Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I) Level of Confidence - Low Indications: Severe COVID -19 patients, with <94% O 2 saturation or need for O 2 supplementation , mechanical ventilation , or extracorpor eal mL/min; ALT and AS T <5 times upper limit of normal. Benefits: Reportedly shortened ICU stay by 31% and p ossible improved survival. Harms: Increased hepatic enzymes, diarrhea, rash, renal impairment, hypotension. Indications for Discontinuation: Completion of a course, i ntolerance, adverse effect. Frequency/Dose/Duration: Remdesivir 200mg IV on day 1, 100mg QD for 9 additional days [161] . Rationale: There are no published quality studies of remdesivir ; however , an RCT that is underway has indicated promising results with 31% shorter ICU stays . There is one case series suggesting a fairly low death rate (13 %) [161] . This medication is being used for the treatment of COVID -19 through RCTs and for compassionate use. There is evidence that remdesivir inhibits viral repli cation in vitro studies [115] . It is possible that remdesivir is more effective if administered in the viral replication stage. Neverth eless, select use of remdesivir is recommended in severely affected patients. Evidence: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, a nd Google Scholar from January 2019 to April 2020 using the following t erms: remdesivir; coronavirus infections, coronavirus, COVID -19, novel corona virus, SARS -CoV-2, 2019 -nCoV; controlled clinical trial, controlled trials, randomized controlled trial, ran domized controlled trials, random allocation, random*, randomized, rand omization, randomly; systematic, systematic review, retrospective, prospectiv studies; clinical study; observational study clinical trial; non -randomized controlled trials as topics. We found and reviewed 6 articles in PubMed, 392 in Scopus, 0 in CINAHL, 6 in Cochrane Library, 1,905 in Google Scholar, and 0 from other sources. We considered for inclusion 1 from PubMed, 0 from Scopus, 0 from CINAHL, 0 from Cochrane Library, 0 from Googl e Scholar, and 0 from other sources. Of the 1 article considered for in clusion, 1 case series and 0 systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. There were no exclusion criteria. The results for databases are sorted by relevancy based on customized search term algorithms. Algorithms for each database determine relevancy . The first 100 articles are reviewed in each search, and if relevant literat ure appears in the first 100 articles, we review an additional 100 articles. If relevant article s appear in these additional 100 articles, we then review another 100. We continue this pattern of review until we review a batch of 100 articles that contains no relevant literature.

Original draft was prepared by an employee of Gilead Sciences and several authors are affiliated with the sponsor. Sample Size: N = 61 patients hospitalized due to SARS -CoV-2 infection, with oxygen saturation of 94% or less while breathing ambient air or receiving oxygen support Age/Se x: Age and sex data only available for 57 patients. Mean age not reported - median age: 6 0 years; 40 males, 13 females Comparison: Remdesivir on compassionate -use ba sis, 10 -day course consisting of 200 mg intravenously on day 1, then 100 mg daily for 9 da ys Follow -up: Follow -up up to 44 days, median follow -up time was 18 days Results: Impro vement in oxygen -support class was seen in 36 patients (68%). 17 patients of 30 (57%) who received mechanical ventilation were extubated. 25 (47%) were discharged while 7 died (13%). Mortality: 18% in those receiving invasive ventilation, 5% in those not r eceiving invasive ventilation Conclusion: \"In this cohort of patients hospit alized for severe Covid -19 who were treated with compassionate -use remdesiv ir, clinical improvement was observed in 36 of 53 patients (68%). Measurement of efficacy will require ongoing randomized, placebo -controlled trials of remdesivir therapy.\" Commen ts: Case series.

Published on http://www.mdguidelines.com 42 Interleukin -6 (sarilumab, siltuximab , and tociliz umab ) are recommended for the treatment of select ed patients with COVID -19. Strength of Evidence - Recommended, Insufficient Evidenc e (I) Level of Confidence - Low Indications: Most commonly u sed in clinical trials for COVID . May be used off - label , as these agents are not FDA -approved for treatme nt of COVID - 19. Severely affected patie nts with COVID -19 with cytokine storm manifestations, including ARDS , were assessed in a retrospective case series [162] . Patients had re spiratory failure, shock , failur CRP [162] . Data also suggest potential improved survival as in one report, the hospital discharge rate of 90% was significantly above expectations. Harms: Potential infection risks . Indications for Discontinuation: Completion of a course, intolerance, adverse effect s. Freque ncy/Dose/Duration: Per trial protocols. Rationale: One case series suggested significant survival and oxygenation benefits. Because there are so few treatments directed at the cytokine storm, the fatality rate is >60%, and the available data are supportive , IL-6 inhibitors are recommended.

Sample Size: N = 21 patients diagnosed with several or critical COVID -19 based on criteria of the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for No vel Coronavirus Pneumonia Age/Sex: Mean age: 56.8 years; 18 males, 3 females Comparison: All patients received lopinavir, methylprednisolone, other symptom relievers and oxygen therapy, and tocilizum ab. Tocilizumab was 400 mg once via IV drip. Follow -up: Follow -up at days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 Results: All patients' body temperature s returned to normal after the first day of tocilizumab and remained stable. 1 5 patients had lowered oxygen intake. Anothe r patient was taken off a ventilator after the first day of tocilizumab. Another patient regained consciousness on day 5 after tracheal extubati on. On day 5, only 2 of 19 patients had abnormal values of white blo od cell count value s. In 10 out of 19 patien ts, the percentage of lymphocytes returned to n ormal while CRP returned to normal for 16 patients. Conclusion: \"In summary, tocilizumab effectively improve s clinical symptoms and repress es the deterioration of severe COVID -19 patients.

Strength of Evidence - Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I) Level of Confidence - Low Indications: Timing o f convalescent antibodies is in the viral replication stage [163] . There are three pathways for administration: 1) clinical trials, 2) expanded use, and 3) single -patient emergency Investigational New Drug. Severely affected patients with COVID -19. FDA r equirements include laboratory confirmation and severe disease (dyspnea, respiratory rate >30, O 2 saturation 93%, or lung infiltrates >50% with in 24 -48 hrs) or life-threatening disease (respiratory failu re, septic shock, and/ or multiorgan or dysfu and informed consent [126] . Benefits: Expected r educed need for a ventilator, ICU stay. Harms: Allergic reactions , thrombotic events . Indications for Discontinuation: Completion of adver se effect . Frequency/Dose/Dura tion: N/A Rationale: convalescent antibodies [164, 165] , although many trials are underway [166] . However, they were reported ly successful in one case series [167] and have been successfully used for other diagnoses , including Ebola [166, 168] . Because the a lternative is typically a fata lity rate of at least 50 -60%, convalescent antibodies are recommended for severe cases in the viral replication stage .
