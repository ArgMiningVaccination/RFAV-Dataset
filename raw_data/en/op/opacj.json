SYNOPSIS AND RATIONAL E FO R THE FOUR-VOLUME REPORT The volum es in the report on OASIS and Outcom e-Based Quality Im provem ent in Hom e Health Care: Research and Dem onstration Findings, Policy Im plications, and Considerations for Future Change are en titled Volume 1: Policy and Program Overview Volume 2: Research and Technical Overview Volume 3: Research and Clinical Supporting Documentation Volume 4: OASIS Chronicle and Recommendations This report series docum ents findings and c onclusions resulting from two large -scale demonstration projects to assess the value of a continuou s qualit y improvem ent (CQI) m ethod- ology to m easure and im prove outcom es of hom e health care. A third project to assist nondem onstration agencies interested in the CQI m ethodolog y supported inform ation dissem i- nation and refinem ents to the approach during and after the latter stages of the dem onstrations. The m ethodology , term ed outcom e-based quality improvem ent (OBQI), was designed prim arily to benefit both Medicare and non-Medicare patients who receive hom e health care. OBQI relies on accurate and uniform inform ation on the health status of patients collected at regular time intervals to m easure the outcom es of care provided. Outcom e measures are adjusted for factors that m ay differentially predispose patients to attaining or not attaining specific outcom es. The second objective of OBQI is to assist hom e care providers to evaluate and im prove their own perform ance. Reports generated through OBQI allow providers to understand and use patient outcom es as perform ance indicators, changing care behaviors to enhance patient outcom es when appropriate. In the interest of readability , the four-volum e report proceeds from general to progres - sively m ore technical and clinical topics. This necessitates a certain am ount of redundancy among the volum es, particularly the first two (portion s of Volum e 1 are excerpted from or closely para phrase material in Volum e 2). A summ ary of selected topics from Volum e 1 stands apart from the four-volum e set. It highlights m ajor points and conclusions but provides only exceptionall y terse discussion of the rationale for the m ain conclusions and recomm endations. The first volum e is a relatively brief docum ent intended for a wide audience of individuals interested in (1) how to evaluate the adequacy of hom e health care for Medicare beneficiaries under a pa yment clim ate that has powerful incentives to underprovide service s needed by patients, and (2) how to improve the quality of care in areas for which patient outcom es are poor and should be im proved. An overview of the success that is attainable through OBQI to e nhance patient outcom es is provided in this docum ent. Volum e 1 is fram ed in the context of issues and events that led to the present-day environm ent for home health care. It is this environm ent and its likely future that the program s at the Centers for Medicare & Medicare Services (CMS)1 must address on behalf of Medicare and Medicaid recipients. The recom mendations presented in this volum e are based on a 15 - year research and developm ent effort. They are focuse d on ways to guide the continued evolution of the Outcom e and Assessm ent Inform ation Set (OASIS) and, m ost im portantly , the quality monitoring, quality improvem ent, pay ment, certification, and program integrity appli - cations that rely on OASIS. These recomm endations are intended to strike the appropriate balance between CMS' s prim ary responsibility to beneficiaries and its secondary responsi - bilities to other governm ental agencies, providers, payers, com mercial interests, and voluntary accreditation program s. 1 The Heal th Care Financi ng Adm inistration (HCFA) changed its nam e to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in June 2001. Both names (and acronyms) are used in this report depending on context and dates. \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO iii Volum e 2 also is reasonably b rief and highlights the re search appro ach and technical findings from the OBQI dem onstration trials. Written for a m ore technical audience, it summ arizes the research m ethodology , experim ental approach, and statistical findings from the dem onstration. A one-page re search abstract is presented that encapsulates the methods, findings, and co nclusions. Cross-refe rences to Volum e 3 guide the reader to further inform a- tion on several technical, clinical, statistical, and programm atic topics. Conclusions that derive from the dem onstration findings and their relevance to current polic y and program - matic considerations are summarized in the final section (these conclusions are discussed in more detail in the final sections of Volum e 1). The third volum e consists of su pporting doc uments covering (1) a chronolog y of research and polic y developm ents that form the backdrop for the results and conclusions of the first two volum es; (2) findings from OASIS reliability studies; (3) an overview of the measurem ent constructs and issue s germ ane to the research; (4) the OASIS data set with an explanatory prologue; (5) an operations m anual for im plem enting and m aintaining OBQI in a home health agency ; (6) illustrative agency-level outcom e, case mix, and adverse event reports; (7) a summary of the operational com ponents of the dem onstration trials; (8) methods used by home health care providers in successfull y enhancing patient outcom es; and (9) a bibliography of relevant literature. Volum e 4 contains points of rationale for why certain steps are prere quisite to or inherent in collecting and processing accurate OASIS data in order to m easure and im prove patient outcom es. An \" OASIS Chronicle\" constitutes the largest portion of Volum e 4. This docum ent provides an item -by-item summary of ke y attributes and recom mendations for every OASIS data item. The attributes provided for each item include its precise wording, the tim e points at which data are recorded, clarify ing o r explanatory info rmation, the rationale for the item , uses for the item that pertain to both agency -speci fic and CMS applications, the developm ental and em pirical testing history for the item , inform ation on validity and reliability , perceived and real constraints or lim itations, other points of infor - mation as appropriate, the overall necessit y of the item , and a recommendation for retention or change. The OASIS Chronicle and its introductory docum entation are intended to form a starting point for the continued evolution an d improvem ent of OASIS a nd its applications. \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO iv PREF ACE The Center for Health Services Resea rch in the Division of Health Care Polic y and Research is a m ultidisciplinary research organi zation established in 1976 at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center.

POLICY AND CLINICAL BACKGROUND 1. The Roles of Medica re and Medica id Medica re-certified hom e health c are in the United States h as its genes is in community and public health nursing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.1-4 The origin al tenet that a variety of health services can be m ore effectively and efficiently provided in patient's hom e environm ent rather than institu tional setting s still und erpins home health care today. Significant change s understandably have occurred in the m anner in which such care is provided, organi zed, m anaged, financed, and regulated. The catalyst for th e most significan t and sweepi ng set of changes was the passage of the Medicare and Medicaid Am endm ents to th e Social Security Act in 1965 (P.L. 89-97). Today, hom e health care is a well-defined benefit for Med icare recip ients occup ational therapy, speech -language pathology, m edical social work, and hom e health aide services. Hom e care is also a Medicaid benefit that varies from state to state, typica lly in cludi ng these and other skilled services plus additional serv ices such as personal care. Because Med icare is the dom inant payer for skilled hom e health care in the United States, its policies and practi ces strongly shape how hom e health care is provided. In particula r, Med icare's approach es to qu ality m onito ring and im provem ent, paym ent, patient and provider eligibili ty, and cost and utilization m onitoring profoundly influence the practice of hom e health care in both the public and private sectors. Although Medicaid is no t as larg e a payer as Med icare for hom e care services n ationally, it is the more dom inant payer in selected states and also exer ts significant influence on how hom e care is organized and practice d. Frequently, state-level Medicaid policies and practices build on, m odify, and extend Medicare hom e health practices fo r certified agencies. Owing to the perv asiveness of Medicare as a f ederal prog ram, the discuss ion la ter in th is report frequently focuses on Medicare patients a nd practices. As used in this report, the term \"hom e health care\" refers to the aforem entioned services for which Medicare passes thes e serv ices as well as all other hom e or com munity -based services that m ight possibly be provided under the rubric of state Medicaid program s. 2. Uniqueness of Home Health Care Given a choic e between in-hom e and institu tiona l care, patients and th eir families nearly always prefer in-hom e care. Becaus e of this p referen ce and the fact th at the patient's hom e environm ent is m ore conducive to a sense of well being, positive m otiva - tion, and constructive comm unication with fam ily m embers and friends, m ost believe the home environm ent to be optim al when it is pos sible and practical to provide care in this setting. \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO 1 Hom e care tends to be educ ation al in na ture because professional providers are physically present in the hom e on a lim ited basis. Patients and their inform al caregivers must frequently be oriented or trained to recognize a nd respond to possible negative changes in physiologic, em otional, cognitive , and functional conditi ons. Teaching occurs in areas such as adm inistering m edications ; monitoring the status of surgical and other types of wounds; evaluating and responding to sym ptom s of cardiac, circulatory, and pulm onary problem s or diseases; m anaging patie nt and inform al caregiver stress ; prov id- ing assistance in activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrum ental activitie s anaging m edical equipm ent; and encouraging and assisting with nutritional and exercise regim ens. Patient s and inform al caregivers often should be educated about hom e safety and how to res pond to circum stances that m ay require em er- gent care, including when and how to m ost effectively access prov iders of em ergent ca re. Because of the in termittent natu re of hom e health care and hom e care in gene ral, patien t and inform al careg iver adherence to tr eatm ent reg imens is m ore dif ficult to ensure and m onitor than in institutional long-term and acute care settings. It is a comm only held belief that patient and inf ormal careg iver motivation play a far more powerf ul role in home care than in m ost health care setti ngs. Thus, another challenge for hom e care providers is how to contribute to and enhance such m otivation. This is an issue in other settings as well, but it can be exceptionally pivotal in hom e care. Unlike other types of care, th e prov ider is a gue st in th e patien t's hom e. At any given tim e, the provider is usually attem pting to maintain a schedule of several visits per day; comm unicate with patients, physicians, a nd other agency staff; and yet provide in- home services that are respon sive to the unique needs of patien ts and inform al caregivers. With m any noteworthy exceptions, comm unicati ons between skilled nurses (or other home health agency staff) and physicians often fall short of what would be desirable. When such communication is inadequa te, it is often due to the busy schedules on the part of both physicians and hom e care providers, an ingrained history of relatively ineffective communication, and the structure of the pa yment system s for physician care and hom e health care. The natu re of communications that o ccur between patients and providers during the intervals between in-hom e visits is im portant, as efforts are now being m ade by providers to reduce the num ber of visits under the current prospe ctive paym ent system (PPS). Telecomm unication is b ecom ing m ore frequent in hom e health care as telehealth approaches receive m ore attention. In various ways and for a num ber of patie nts, hom e care is the \"last resort\" for avoiding nu rsing hom e care or p lacem ent in in stitutional long-term care. Hom e care can take on imm easurable im portance for m any indi viduals whose quality of life and personal identity a re intertwined with rem aining at home rather than being placed in a nursing home. An extrem ely significant enabling conditi on for pa tients to rem ain at hom e is the ability to f unction and m aintain suf ficient independence in such dom ains as in-hom e mobility, m eal preparation, m edication adm inistration, telephone use, dressin g, toileting, and bathing. In no sm all way, the ultim ate or bottom -line purpose of hom e care (and home health c are) is to ass ist indiv iduals to remain or becom e as independ ent a s realisti- cally po ssible in su ch functional areas. Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO 2 This is true not only for individuals se eking to avoid nursing hom e placem ent, but for nearly a ll indiv iduals who r eceive hom e care -- the y im plicitly and som etimes explicitly view hom e care as a way to co mpensate for or enhance their presently constrained functional capacity so that they m ight cope better or m ore independently in their hom e environm ent. Even m ore technica l and skilled services such as wound care, physical therapy, and psychological counseling often have as their longer run objective independence in one or several dom ains of functioning. In all, the nature, environm ent, and interp erson al circum stances of hom e care delivery are unique. It is ex tremely difficult and challenging to monitor the qua lity and effectiveness of care provided in the hom e. For this re ason, m onitoring patient outcom es is particu larly useful in hom e care. Because the interval over which hom e care is provided should be characterized by im prove ment, stabilization, or a m inimal rate of decline in functioning, health and functional status should be m easured at a m inimum of two time points: start of care and d ischarge. This is n ecess ary to m onitor change in health sta tus over the c are inte rval and eva luate the effectiveness of care. Changes in health status or patient outcom es can then be m easured across large groups of patients cared for by a particular agency in order to judge whether its hom e care is effective relative to oth er agen cies'. Mon itoring hea lth o r functiona l status, su ch as ab ility to ambulate, at a s ingle po int in tim e is not sufficient for this purpose. 3. Vulnerabilit y of Our Home Care Population Many of the over four million5 predom inantly elderly individuals who receive hom e care in the United States are h ighly vuln erable to inadequ acies in and even poten tial exploitation through our hom e care delivery system . While no doubt exists that hom e care is a valuable benefit for patients, the age and frailty of this population6 combined with the ve ry attr ibute tha t defines such care -- its provision in th e patien t's hom e -- are the prim ary reasons for this vul nerability. Unlike c are provid ed in c linics or institu tiona l settings, the approaches that can be m aintained or called upon as needed to m onitor shortcom ings in hom e-based care are perforce costly, m ore complex, and less likely to be undertaken. For long-term care provided in nursing hom es and inpatient rehabilitation facilities, the resident or patient's conditi on can be and often is m onitored by several providers, both skilled and paraprofessional if needed, on a daily ba sis. For hom e care, depending on need and the type(s) of care be ing provided, a patient m ay be receiving interm ittent care from a single prov ider. Rarely is it around -the-clock care and rarely are other professional providers co ntinuously available to assess patient health status and conduct on-site m onitoring and m anagem ent of the care being pr ovided by their staff. Thus, while quality assessm ent can be and is done in hom e care, it is far m ore challeng - ing and m ust rely on procedures and activities often different from those in institutional settings. As a result, for m any hom e care agencies, qu ality m onitoring is not sufficien tly effective. Another factor com plicating the process of care prov ision in the hom e is the fact that inform al support plays a crucial role as an adjunct to patient treatm ent. Some hom e care patien ts hav e no inform al caregivers liv ing with th em. Even when such caregivers are availab le, they usually are not aware of how to prope rly assist in m onitoring and \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO 3 selec ted te chnica l, sk illed, and ev en p ersonal care needs of the patien t. Com bined with the f act that p atients and their caregivers, if presen t, are frequently elder ly, som etimes cognitive ly im paired, and often f unctionally dis abled, these circ um- stances can and som etimes do result in exa cerbations of both chr onic and acute condi - tions. When this occurs, it is often m ore difficult for hom e care prov iders to m onitor and respond to patient prob lems as quickly as prov iders in other care settings. Such vulnerability leads to problem s, defi ciencies in care, a nd in selected well- publicized in stances over the p ast few years, ev en cases of scandalous neglect and patient abuse. The factual nature of such problem s is borne out by various reports and legal cases.7-13 Concerns about the vulne rability of the hom e care population have been voiced for som e time, going at least as far back as the late 1980's when those in positions of authority and oversight, includi ng m embers of Congress, were exhorted to m ore closely exam ine the \"black box \" of hom e care.14 The m ost appropriate s tance on such is sues, however, should not result in finger pointing at the hom e care industry which m ost would agree is com prised of a m ix of organizations and individuals that span the rang e from highly com petent and a ltruistically m otivated to, in som e cases, those egregiously uncon - cerned about their patients. Rather, we s hould acknowledge the de gree to which a wide variety of hom e care patients are vulnerab le and m ake certain that app ropriate steps are taken to m inimize the negative ram ifications of this vulnerability. In doing so, we should ensure that hom e care agencies have tools and m ethods of direct value for identifying and solving quality problem s. The infor mation generated by such tools and m ethods should be useful for as m any agency-level, clinical , managerial, and adm inistrative purposes as possible. At the sam e time, such inform ation should allow the Medicare and Medicaid program s as well as the general pub lic to better understand and ev aluate the quality of home health care. It is noteworthy that th e recently im plemented PPS for Medicare hom e health care, which pays agencies a predeterm ined am ount for an episode of care (adjusting to som e extent f or var iation in patien t adm itting cha racteristics as well as loc al labor co sts), has the unintended consequence of increasing cons idera bly pa tient vuln erability. Specif i- cally, since the dollar am ount an agency will be paid for an episode of care is preset, there is an incen tive a t the indiv idual patient level to a ttempt to prov ide ca re in such a manner that it costs less (pref erably con siderably less pu rely f rom the perspec tive of profit) than the paym ent a mount. It is no t difficult to envision the m any circum stances where needed care could be m inimized or ev en withheld from patients because of this incentive, and the challenges inherent in m onitoring whether all of the serv ices n eeded are actually being provided in th e hom e. In view of these cha llenges, neither is it difficult to understand that m onitoring patient outcom es would be us eful to assess the effec - tiveness of hom e care services in term s of their positive or negative im pacts on patient well being. Outcom e measures (changes in pa tient health status between the start and end of care) can form a reasonable founda tion for m onitoring whether one hom e care agency or even a group of providers is, on average, perform ing (exceptionally) better than, about the sam e as, som ewhat m ore poorly than, or egregiously m ore poorly than other agencies or providers -- in order to (1) validly m onitor what is happening as hom e care is being provided to th is vulnerable population and (2) to identify and rem edy inadequacies in hom e care delivery. \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO 4 4. Historical Shifts in Supply, Utiliz ation, and Cost of Medicare Home Health Care By rem oving several restrictions on the provision and supply of hom e health care, the Om nibus Budget Reconcilia tion Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-499) encou raged hom e health utilization and enabled m ore hospital-base d and proprietary hom e health ag encies to participate in Medicare, resulting in an increase from 2924 agencies in 1980 to 5695 agencies in 1990.15, 16 Implem entation of Medicare prospective paym ent - tals based on diagnosis-related gr oups (DRGs) served as a cata lyst for hospital patients to be discharged \"qu icker and sicker,\" there by increasing the case m ix intensity of patients admitted to hom e health care by the m id-to-late 1980s.17 As a result of a l987 legal challenge, clarification of Medicare covera ge of interm ittent hom e health care in 1989 spurred growth to 10,577 agencies by 1997.18, 19 This was accompanied by increases in Medicare hom e health care v isits from 36 million in 1987 to 256 million in 1997, the average num ber of visits per patient from 23 in 1987 to 73 in 1997, and Medicare hom e health expenditures from $2.6 billion in 1987 to $16.7 billion in 1997.19, 20 In response to these incr eases, Congress enacted a sweeping set of changes in Medicare paym ent for hom e health care through the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33). This legislation im posed lim its and decreases in paym ent that were implemented under the Interim Paym ent Syst em (IPS) for certified providers of hom e health care until PPS could be im plem ented, which occurred in October 2000. Within just two years, by 1999, IPS resulted in m ore than a 50% reducti on in total visits to 112 million, a d ecline of over 40% in visits per patient to 42, and a greater than 50% 21decrease in M edicare expenditure s on hom e health care to $7.9 billion. Agency closures and withdrawals from the Medicare program reduced th e num ber of agencies by almost one-third to 7146 by the end of 2000.22 As these wide swings in the supply, use, and cost of hom e health services were occurring, particularly in the 1990's, concerns regarding the lack of evidence on patient- level effects of hom e health care were h eightening.23, 24 CMS, term ed the Health Care Financing Adm inistration (HCFA) at that tim e, did not have objective inform ation on the value of such care to a ssess the effects of thes e substantial swings on Medicare beneficiaries and other hom e health patien ts (under the Cond itions of Participation, the Medicare program is expected to m onitor th e quality of care f or all patients, no t sim ply Medicare patien ts, who receive hom e care from certified ag encies).25, 26 Physicians, hospital discharge planners, and case m anage rs lacked ev idence on the effectiv eness of home health c are in the ir comm unities th at would as sist in m aking ref erral dec isions. Most im portantly, those who adm inistered the Medicare and Medicaid program s, other payers, hom e care clinical m anagers, physicians , other individual clinicians, and adm inis- trators at hom e health agencies were unable to assess the outcom es of hom e health care for their p atients. There was no uniform , accurate outcom e-based inform ation to isolate possible quality problem s and target quality improve ment efforts as paym ent lessened under IPS and was based late r on per-case reim bursem ent, which, as noted, can create pervers e incentiv es to underserve patients. \u00a92002 th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO 5 5. The Challenge Confronting the Centers for Medicare & Med icaid Serv ices As the adm inistering body for the Medica re and Medicaid program s, CMS has a considerable range of responsi bilities to several constituencies. No responsibilities, of course, are m ore im portant than those to i ndividual Medicare benefi ciaries and recip ients of Medicaid services. In the hom e health care field today, the vu lnerab ility of the p atient population, uniqueness of hom e health care, and even ts of the last two decades, partic - ularly the paym ent system changes in recen t years, poin t to and am plify the need for CMS to plan and m aintain well-designed pr ogram s and adm inistrative practices. Such program s must be responsive to the now in creased needs of Medicare and Medicaid patien ts for hom e health se rvices of adequate quality. In fact, quality should progres - sively improve beyond its current level. This program developm ent m ust be sufficiently visionary so it transcend s the p roblem s unique to the present policy clim ate and encourages long-term effectiveness as well as efficiency within the hom e health care delivery system . This is no sm all challenge, particularly in view of current political issues fostered by provider responses to the considerable reductions in paym ent and Medicare expenditures on hom e health care between 1997 and 2000. Nonetheless, it is imperative to m eet this cha llenge in a m anner that endures and ensures quality care on behalf of the m illions enro lled in th e Medicar e and Med icaid progr ams. Since Med icare program s and practices in the hom e health care field set the pace for hom e care nationally, this challeng e translates into (1 ) continuing with planned and extant program s that presently or will soon better serve beneficiary needs, (2) changing other program features to m ore effectivel y serve such needs, and (3) perhaps m ost importantly, developing and im plementing an ove rall fram ework or system for continued evolution and refinem ent that encourages and supports regular im prove ments over the course of tim e. The purpose of this repor t to CMS is to pr esent and discuss findings from a 15-year res earch and developm ent program that recen tly resu lted in the com pletion of two home health care dem onstrations that shed extensive light on ways for CMS to m eet this challenge. The rem ainder of this volum e summarizes the outcom e improve ment approach used in the dem onstrations, and findings about its im pacts on patient outcom es (Section B); presents inf ormation tha t facilita tes und erstanding the nature of the findings and their implications (Section C); summ arizes presen t concerns about OASIS in view of recent paym ent system changes and analyzes such c oncerns in the contex t of agency and CMS responsibilities and program s (Section D); a nd concludes with pract ical considerations for CMS in addressing the challenge of how to ensure that quality hom e health c are can be efficiently and effectively provided (Section E). Together, Sections D and E address how the quality im provem ent methodology and th e uniform data set needed to im plem ent it are of value to providers as well as patients. At this writing, m ost in the hom e health industry are not sufficiently aware of the advantages of the outcom e-based quality im provem ent (OBQI) appro ach as a so lution to many current problem s in areas such as qua lity m onitoring and im provem ent, clinical manage ment, patient m ix monitoring, public re lations and m arketing, patient assessm ent and care planning, utilizati on and cost m onitoring, cost-effective care provision, \u00a92002 for Heal th Serv rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO 6 itation, and feedback to phy sicians and hos pital discharge plann ers. For CMS, th e implications of OBQI and OASIS data are discussed in Section E in the context of several programm atic applications including (1) patient outcom e evaluation and m oni- toring, (2) tracking adverse patient events, (3) evaluating change s or shifts in the types of patients being served by hom e health providers regionally and nationally, (4) public or consum er reporting, (5) progressive refinem ent toward m ore equitably adjusting outcom e measures and PPS pay ment rates for case m ix differences am ong ho me health agencies, (6) implem enting outcom e-based applications in survey and certific ation, (7) monitoring program integrity, (8 ) facilitating the involve ment of Quality Im provem ent Organization s (QIOs), previously known as Peer Review Organizations (PROs), in outcom e enhance - ment, and (9) m ore eff iciently dete rmining patien t-leve l progr OUTCOME-BASED QUALITY IMPROVEM ENT DEMONS TRATIONS IN HOME HEALTH CARE 1. Rationale fo r the Demonstrations Since its inception, the continuous qual ity im provem ent (CQI) m ovement has 27-30shaped quality m anagem ent efforts in the United State s' hea lth c are system . CQI changed our orientation from traditiona l qua lity assu rance dire cted at sa the s tructure, proc esses, and (occasiona lly) outcom es of health care to an orientation that em phasizes conti nuous enhancem ent of h ealth and health care from year to year31-34 and, to a greater extent than be fore, the im pacts of care on the well being of patients (p atient outcom es).35-37 Salien t features of an effective CQI (1) an em phasis on clin ically usef ul and sens itive indicato rs of quality th at can be measured across tim e periods, (2) ongoing reporting of statistical inform ation on such measures that perm its tim ely com parisons of present with past perform ance, and (3) sufficient clarity and m eaningfulness of findings so that clinicians, m anagers, and payers c an encour age or im plem ent change s in care b ehavio rs to im prove quality o r reinforce exem plary care. Anticipa ting the need f or ou tcom e-rela ted inf ormation tha t might encourag e CQI in home health care, HCFA, in conjunction with the Robert W ood Johnson Foundation and later the New York State Departm ent of Hea lth, em barked on a research and developm ent program in the late 1980s to assess the feasibility and util ity of m easuring the outcom es of hom e health care. This 15-year program evolved through seve ral overlapping stages of research, developm ent, p ilot testing, clinical and m ethodological review, and dem on- stration and evaluation activities. The findi ngs reported here pertain to the recently completed OBQI de monstration trial and evalua tion stage of this prog ram. Most of the material in this section is p araphrased o r extracted from Volum e 2, which contains further detail on m ethodologies and cross-references to docum ents that provide clinical and technical inform ation on OBQI and the dem onstrations. The following subsections (2-5) highligh t selected featur es of the in itial re search and key results from the demonstration component of this program . \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO 7 2. Outcome Measures and Needed Data At the outs et of the r esearch prog ram that ultim ately led to the d emonstrations, a draft set of outcom es was refined through several rounds of ex ternal review by researchers in the long -term care field and nationally recognized clinical experts from all disciplines involved in hom e health care. The reviews were desi gned to evaluate each outcom e in term s of its clinical v alidity a nd utility, im portance to patient health, and expected m easurem ent precision. Data item s to m easure the resulting outcom es were developed thereafter using exta nt data sets, refining existi ng data item s as needed, and developing new item s when others were nonexiste nt or inadequate. The final data set for measuring and risk adjusting outcom es was na med the Outcom e and Assessment Inform ation Set (OASIS) for hom e health ca re. The item s in this d ata set wer e develop ed in this research program for m easuring, evaluating, and ultim ately im proving patient outcom es. Thus, the developm ent of OASIS was driven by outcom e measures, outcom e measurem ent, and the need to adju st outco me measures for case m ix differences am ong home health ag encies. The concep tual and em pirica l research tha t resu lted in th e OASIS data se t is summ arized in the introdu ctory n arrative to the OASIS Chronicle that appears in Volum e 4 of this report se ries. This da ta set was designed to be integra ted into a hom e health agency's start-of-care and follow-up patien t assessment for ms, replacing lik e item s with OASIS item s. In order to m easure outcom es in the ini tial research and deve lopm ent studies, and consistent with the tim ing of Medicare (pla n-of-care) recertifi cation, OASIS item s were completed at start of care for each adult (18 years or o lder), nonm aternity patient and approxim ately eve ry 60 days un til and inc luding time of discharge. The 60-day in terva l, which resulted f rom testing da ta co llection in tervals of varying lengths, was optim al for the com bined objective of provid er efficiency and clinical and sta tistical utility of outcom e measurem ent. Data item s could, ther efore, b e used effectiv ely for as sessing patient hom e care needs, care planning, m easur ing outcom es as changes in health status between start of care and fo llow-up points, and risk adjus ting outcom e measures to take into consideration case m ix differences betw een an agen cy's patients and its com parison group. For the sake of parsim ony and clinical u tility, 41 outcom e measures were us ed in the subsequent OBQI dem onstrations. These included (1) functi onal outcom es such as improve ment in am bulation/locom otion, im provem ent in toileting, im provem ent in manage ment of oral m edications, and im prove ment in eating, as well as stabilization in bathing and stabilization in light m eal preparation; (2) physiol ogic outcom es such as improve ment in status of surgical wounds, im provem ent in dyspnea, and im provem ent in urinary incon tinen ce, languag e; (3) emotion al/ behavioral/cognitive outcom es such as im prove ment in anxiety level and stabilization in cognitive functioning; and (4) selected utiliz ation outcom e measures such as acute care for Heal th Serv ices UCHSC , Den ver, CO 8 3. Outcome-Based Quality Improvement The essential features of the CQI appl ications fram ework e mployed in the OBQI demonstration trials were developed and refi ned in a pilot projec t involving several hom e health agencies in the earl y 1990s. This fram ework incl udes the outcom e analysis and outcom e enhancem ent components depicted in Figure 1. The outcom e analysis com po- nent begins with collecting (as part of routin e patient assessm ent), com puterizing, and transm itting OASIS data to a c entral sou rce (the Unive rsity of Colorado in the c ase of the demonstrations). Outcom e, case m ix, and a dverse even t repo rts are retu rned to each agency on an annual basis. Most im portant is the All Patients' Outcom e Report that perm its agency staff to analyze their patien t outcom es aggregated to the ag ency level. This report provides a risk-adj usted com parison of agency perform ance (1) relati ve to a national reference or benchm ark population and (2) from one year to the next. The case mix prof ile report conta ins an ove rview of the agen cy's adm itting cas e mix for the current tim e period or year relative to the agency's prior tim e period and the (national) reference group. The adverse event report pr ovides a profile of low-frequency adverse patient outcom es such as em ergent care fo r hypo/hyperglycem ia. A com plete copy of the outcom e report series for a hypothetical ag ency is found in Supporting Docum ent 6 in Volum e 3. FIGURE 1: OBQI Applications Frame work.

These include p rocess-of-care inv estigations th culminate in th e developm ent and im plem en- tation of plans of action specifying how car e behaviors will be changed to enhance \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO 9 outcom es. Upon conclusion of the first dem onstration year, each dem onstration agency received an outcom e report showing its perf ormance that year relative to all dem on- stration ag encies (no prior co mparison was possible the first year). After rev iewing th e report, various m ethods were im plemented by agency staff to assess and change specific care behaviors related to target outcom es of their choosing. Agen cies produced written plans of action for their target outcom es at the beginning of th e second demonstration year. For each such ou tcom e, these plans do cumented the target ou tcom e, care behav iors being targeted, how and when they would be changed, who would be responsible for implementing the changes, and how the ch anges would be m onitored on a continuing basis. The ou tcom e enhancem ent process wa s repeated at the start of each succeeding demonstration year when the annu al ou tcom e report was received. Accurate and uniform data on patient hea lth sta tus ar e critical for OBQI. The collection and use of OASIS data for this purpose introduced far more rigor into the assessm ent process than had b een cus tomary in m any of the dem onstration agencies. Further, the OBQI approach is novel in the sense that it entails a considerably different type of thinking and philosophy than typical ly used by hom e care providers for quality assurance. Such thinking requires analysis that links ca re to s pecif ic ou tcom es to f acili- tate and coo m prov iders. Training program s that focused on incorporat ing OASIS into com prehensive a ssessm ents and using OBQI to evaluate and enhance patient outcom es were an im portant com ponent of the pilot and dem onstration projects. 4. The OBQI Demonstrat ions After the in itial resea rch, in cluding developing and em pirica lly testing outcom e measures and OASIS data item s over a period of sever al yea rs, as we ll as a pilot to asses s the f easib ility of OBQI, two large-scale dem onstration trials were designed. Hospital - ization was selected as the most pivotal outcom e on which to concentrate OBQI efforts since it cou ld be readily eval uated for non-OBQI patients as well as on a pre/post basis for OBQI patients. Therefore, inco rporated into the dem onstrati on and evaluation design was the request that dem onstration agency staff choose hospitalization as one of their two target outcom es each year (a few agencies selected m ore than two target outcom es). Hospitalization was a recomm ended target outcom e for four reasons. First, it is im por- tant subs tantively, becaus e if a patien t's cond ition chang es or declin es to a point where inpatient hospital care is necessa ry, it is likely that a serious change in health status has occurred. Second, if providers could im prove (i.e., lower) hospitali zation rates, it would strongly suggest OBQI could be effective. Hospitalization is a difficult outcom e to impact in view of the m ultiplic ity of factor s tha t influenc e it, the f requent need f or various clin ical staff of the hom e care agen cy to be involved, and the need to have physician input and involvem ent in the proce ss. Thus, hospitalizat ion cannot be easily impacted without often involving and influenc ing the care behaviors of several providers. Third, in keeping with the research design, having all agencies attem pt to im prove a single outcom e (which encom passes a num ber of potential health status changes) would facilitate hom ogeneous pre/post and interven tion/nonin terven tion com parisons of the effectiveness of OBQI. Fourth, reducing hospitalization rates can have substantial impacts on (lowering ) the total cos t of care while at the sam e time reflecting enhan ced \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO 10 patient outcom es and, hence, system wide co st-effectiveness. For the second target outcom e, agencies were free to choose from any of the re maining outcom e measures in their outcom e reports. They were provided with written guidelines and training on how to select an outcom e for improvem ent based on outcom e report findings. Three comparative approaches were incorpor ated into the resear ch design. First, a pre/post com parison of risk-adjusted outcom es was to be undertaken from one demon- stration year to the next for patients pooled across all dem onstration agencies. Second, for the m ost important outcom e, hospitalization, a random ly selected com parison group of non-OBQI Medicare hom e health care patie nts from the sam e states as the OBQI Medicare patients would be used to assess wheth er changes or trend s in hosp italization rates for OBQI Medicare patients were di fferent. Third, since the OBQI methodology involves selecting specific ta rget or OBQI outcom es, a comparison of im prove ments or changes in such outcom es with im provem ents or changes in (uncorrelated) nontarget outcom es would be undertaken. In acco rd with th is dem onstration desi gn and evaluation plan, HCFA sponsored a National OBQI Dem onstration trial be tween 1995 and 2000, with funding from both HCFA and the Robert W ood Johnson Foundation. This National Dem onstration involved 54 home health agencies from 27 states. If successful, the dem onstration approach could serve as a prototype for a national OBQI pr ogram for all Medicare-certif ied hom e health agencies. The national OBQI trial was desi gned to establish a m ethodology and tem plate to (1) collect unifor m (OASIS) data on all adult, nonm aternity hom e health patients to measure and report patient outcom es; (2) utilize outcom e measures for CQI in hom e health care; and (3) provide a foundation for an approach to enhancing patient outcom es that cou ld lead to a m ore efficient sy stem wide approach to perform ance im prove ment in home health care. Patterned after HCFA's national OBQI demonstration in late 1995, the New York State Departm ent of Health im plemented a statewide OBQI dem onstration that began with 19 agencies and would eventually invol ve 33 certified agencies as well as 24 non- certified agencies. Like th e National Dem onstration, this six-year program was adm inis- tered by the University of Colorado Center fo r Health Se rvices Resea rch. After tra ining by Research Center s taff, the agencies pa rticipa ting in the two demonstration trials integrated into their day-to-d ay operation all facets of OAS IS data collection, m onitoring, processing, and transm ission, as we ll as all com ponents of OBQI. 5. Findings on OBQI Impacts The dem onstration results are base d on 157,548 predom inantly elderly adult patien ts adm itted ove r three years to the 54 OBQI agenc ies in the National Dem onstra - tion, 105,917 patients adm itted over four years to the original 19 OBQI agen cies (i.e., those certified agencies partic ipating f or all f our years) in the New York State Dem on- stration, and 248,621 patients adm itted over thre e years to non-OBQI control ag encies in the 27 demonstration states. The tim e periods for each cycle of out come reporting in the demonstration were approxim ately 12 months and were term ed Years 1, 2, 3, and 4 (Year 4 pertained only to the Ne w York State Dem onstration). \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea lization resu lts summ arized in th is paragraph are all statistically signifi - cant and based on risk-adjusted outcom e analyses that com pensated for possible case m ix changes that m ight have occurred from year to year during both dem onstration trials (see Volum e 2 for further details). For the Na tional Dem onstration, the pooled hospitalization rates for all patients declin ed steadily over three years of the dem onstration, from 32.5% in the first year to 25.3% in th e third year. This case m ix-or risk-adjusted net decrease of 7.2 percentage points (i.e., the risk-adjuste d decline from 32.5% to 25.3%) in hospitali - zation rates f or the Na tiona l Dem onstration r esulted in an over all relative ra te of decline of 22% over the three-year dem onstration pe riod. Analogous decreases in risk-adjusted hospita lization rates occur red for the New York State Dem onstration patients. The consistent decline in hospita lization rates from 30.1% in the first year to 22.2% in the fourth year produced a net de crease of 7.9 percentage poin ts for a four-year overall relative rate of decline of 26%. The hospitalization rate changes for non-OB QI Medicare hom e health care patients in the dem onstration states were based on a 5% random sample of Medicare patients admitted to the nond emonstration ag encies in these 27 states. The findings showed only small changes in hospitalizati on rates for non-OBQI patients in the dem onstration states between Year 1 and Year 2 of the dem onstrat ion period (a net decrease of 0.4%). The change between Year 2 and Year 3 (a net decreas e of 0.3%) also was sm all com pared to the substantially larger hospit alization decreas es attained in the dem onstrations. The net decrease was less than one percentag e poin t over the th ree demonstration years. Since the 5% claim s file for Medicare hom e health care p atients d id not p ermit a represen tative sample from non-OBQI agencies in New York State, claim s analyses were not under- taken for non-OBQI patients in New York State. The risk-adjusted results for target outcom es other th an acu te hospitalization for all patien ts paralleled and reinfo rced the hosp italization findings. The percent im prove ment for all such outcom es across the pooled National Dem onstration patients from Year 1 to Year 2 was 7.7%. The analogous percent im provem ent for (uncorrelated) com parison outcom es was 1.4% over this period. The per cent im provem ent in target outcom es from Year 2 to Year 3 was 5.8%, com pared with a 1.1% im prove ment rate in com parison outcom es over the sam e period for the Nationa l Dem onstration ag encies. The New York State results dem onstrated analogous statisti cally signifi cant changes rget outcom es rela tive to chang es in com parison ou tcom es over the success ive four years of this d emonstration. For each pair of consecu tive years in th e New York State Dem onstration, the percent im provem ent in target outcom es was approxim ately 6.0% and the com e rate was approxim ately 1.0%. The favorable outcom es of de monstration ag encies were broadly based but did not occur universally in every dem onstration ag ency. Between 70% and 90% of th e agencies favorably and s ignifican tly im pacted their target outcom es from one year to the next (i.e., for each pair of adjacen t years), although the i ndividu al ag encies that sign ifican tly influ - enced either ho spitalization or o ther target outcom es were not always the sam e for each pair of years. \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO 12 C. DISCUSSION OF THE DEMONST RATION FINDINGS 1. Magnitude of the Impacts of OB QI The 22% and 26% relative rates of decline in ho spitaliza tion ove r the thre e- and four-year outcom e reporting cy cles of the Nation al and New York Sta te Dem onstrations were not only of considerable m agnitude , but they were unparalleled by changes in hospitalization rates for non-OBQI patients in the national de monstration states over the same period of tim e. Analogously, the rate s of im provem ent for OBQI target outcom e measures, which averaged between 5% a nd 7% per year, were unparalleled by the approxim ately 1% rates of change in nontarg et outcom es, highlighting the effectiveness of the outcom e enhancem ent com ponent of OBQI that focuses on changing care behaviors for target outcom es. In general, (1) the m agnitude of the e ffects of OBQI, (2) the large num bers and variety of patients and providers involved wh ich ensured breadth of experience and statis - tical power, (3) the consistency of the pr e/post and study/control findings for hospital - ization rates, (4) the agreem ent between the ho spitalizati on and health status outcom e results, (5 ) the p arallel findings f or th e two separate dem onstration tr ials, (6) the continual successes of outcom e enhancem ent for the vast m ajority of agencies throughout the dem onstration, and (7) the inform ation conveyed by clinical staff (discussed shortly) about the value of OBQI -- com bine to indi cate a pervasively favor able im pact of OBQI on patient outcom es. The m agnitude of th e im prove ments in hospitalization rates and other outcom es was substantial, particularly since hom e health clinicians had never undertaken this type of quality improve ment. Further, the la tter stages of these dem on- strations were conducted during a tim e of unprecedented and radical decline in paym ent (under IPS) accom panied by large reductions in visits per patient and serious threats to agency surv ival. Thus, thes e OBQI im pacts on patient outcom es were attained despite a marked decrease in patient care revenu es. 2. Home Health Agency Training, Problems, and Support for OBQI a. OASIS and OB QI Training : At sele cted central locations, s taff m embers (typically two) from each dem onstration agen cy participated in two training prog rams. Initial training was f ocused on integ rating OAS IS into c linical reco rds and m onitoring data collection, and the sec ond dealt with interp reting outcom e reports and conducting the outcom e enhancem ent com ponent of OBQI upon receipt of the reports. The staff members who attended the traini ng sessions were, in turn, responsible for training the remainder of the staff at their respectiv e agen cies. No paym ents f or participa ting in th e demonstrations were available to OBQI agencies. b. Agency Challenges and Problem s: The most significant challenges faced by the dem onstration agencies were fourfold. First, the novelty of con ceptualizing and using patien t outcom es as perf ormance tr ansition f rom the trad itional mindset with which hom e care clinicians tend to app roach pa tient care. Practition er education and training typically focus on processes of care (i .e., how to provide care) and rarely deal explicitly with system atically evaluating the effectiv eness of care through \u00a92002 Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO 13 rigorous and statistical analysis of patient ou tcom es. This initially led seve ral clinic ians to question OASIS and the em phasis on coll ecting uniform data to m easure outcom es. During the second year of OBQI clinicians ty pically m ade the transition to an outcom e- oriented m indset and better understood the need for OASIS data . Second, collecting uniform patient status data required agen cy clinical staff to conduct m ore precise assessm ents. Because hom e care agen cy staff tend to b e vigo rously independen t, use of standard language in assessm ents was not al ways well-received. Adm inistrative support for the long-term value of th e data assisted clinicians to work through this change process. Third, despite considerable auto mation advances in m ost dom ains of health care, a larg e portion of the hom e health in dustry was not au tomated in term s of clinic al records and other aspects of patient care during the dem onstr ation period (this continues to be true in m any agencies today). As a resu lt, com puterizat ion and transm ission of OASIS data, which would not have been a new concept in m any health care settings, required not only additional tim e and resour ces, but orientation to a m ore data driven manage ment approach (which the hom e care field was slowly m oving toward in any event). Paraphrasing som e dem onstration agen cy staff, \"OBQI has forced us into the computer age, better now than later.\" Adaptations to the new autom ation requirem ents, when they did not occur fairly quickly, occu rred during the second year of OBQI, after the first round of outcom e reports. Fourth, as already discussed, the im pacts of IPS were demoralizing to adm inistra tive and clinica l managem ent staf f as well as to m ost clini - cians, who gradu ally b ecam e aware of the subs tantial revenue declines in their agen cies during the latter part of the dem onstration pe riod. The fact that they persisted with OBQI as a m eans of m onitoring and im proving outco mes was a testam ent to the comm itment to patien t care th at had em erged at thes e agencies (or th at already exis ted and was rein- forced during the dem onstrations), and to their b elief in the co st effectiv eness of OBQI. Some agencies had sp ecific d ifficulties w ith OASIS or the OBQI approach. The more significant problem s that occu rred at a few agencies typically resulted from either inadequa te atten tion to ef ficiently in tegra ting OASIS into the day -to-day a ssessment and data co llection routines of clinica l staff, or from technically flawed or inefficient im ple- mentation and m aintenance of system s for computeriz ing and transm itting OASIS data. Interestingly, but not surprising ly, staf f at th e relatively few agencies that failed to implem ent and properly integrate OASIS and OBQI (in accord with the p rotoco ls and guidelines provided during trai ning) complained vociferously to dem onstration project staff at the University of Colorado about the burden of OASIS data collection and transm ission, as well as other as pects of OBQI. However, vi rtually no attrition in agency participation during the dem onstration period occurred and, by the end of this period, the relatively few \"com plaining agencies\" had been reduced to two or three in both dem on- stration p rojects com bined as accepta nce of the OBQI approach increased. c. Emerging Support for OBQI Over Tim e: Communication w ith clinical and administrative staff from OBQI agenci es continued throughout the dem onstration projects. In addition to cl arifying issues and resolving technical problem s on an ongoing basis, University of Colorado project staff received considerable feedback about OBQI. The responses to OBQI were nearly always posi tive, particularly in the later y ears of the demonstration trials, after (1) OAS IS had been thoroughly integrated into assessm ent and clinical record keeping, (2) computeriza tion and data transm ission issues had been Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO 14 addressed, and (3 ) agencies received th e first round of outcom e reports. By the end of the demonstration trials, staff at num erous OBQI agencies had com mented on the value of being able to rigorously m onitor patient ou tcom es, use the various reports (including adverse event and case m ix reports as well as outcom e reports) to isolate and resolve problem s on behalf of individual patients a nd groups of patients, access reports on case mix and the care need s of patien ts for st affing and clinical m anage ment purposes, compare outcom es with utilization to as sess co st effectiv eness, a nd continually enhanc e patient outcom es. 3. Reasons for OBQI Successes in the Demonstrations After the dem onstrations concluded, the staff of m ost participating agen cies continued to use OBQI. As already disc ussed, dem onstration agency staff generally exhibited a strong sense of ownership of OBQI (and OASIS), reflected by the m anner in which they adap ted OBQI to their ag encies ' day-to-day operations. Several f actors accounted for the successes of the OBQI de monstration program s. First, inform ation obtained, analyzed, and used in feedback reports is precise, understandable, and of practical value for clinicians. Second, when implemented correctly, requisite data item s and CQI activ ities can b e integra ted in to and replace cu rrent item s and activitie s rather than add substantially to the day-to-day operational routin e of clinical staff. Third, th e OBQI applications fram ework encourages c linical y improvem ent coordi - nators to be rigorous and innovative in areas such as (1) choosi ng target outcom es; (2) isolating im portant care behaviors to cha nge in their agency or care environm ent; (3) writing a focused plan of action docum enting target care behaviors to change, how to change them , who is responsible for chan ges, how changes will be im plemented and monitored, and when these va rious activities are to occu r; and (4) motivating other clinician s to ch ange and ensu ring that changed behaviors con tinue. Such facto rs serve as the basis for providing inform ative feedback to clinic ians and give rise to a f lexible and pragm atic approach to enhancing outcom es. An important featu re of the OBQI fram ework is that it does not rely exclusively on a for mula-driv en appro ach such as clinical guidelines, care m aps, or clinical paths for specific patient problem s (although these can be used in the process-of-care investiga - tion). Rather, it relies on practical feedback of a statistical nature and, m ost im portantly, challenges clinicians to exercise sound judge ment and innovation to isolate strengths and weaknesses in care behaviors or practices with in the contex t of their specific agen cy or clinical group. As OBQI continues, it is likely that additional findings and conclusions will be av ailable on specif ic clinic al, te chnical, and coord inative app roaches u prov iders to enhan ce outcom es. As agencies gain m ore experience with OBQI, the body of knowledge about m ethods used to enhance patient outcom es is expected to continue to grow. 4. Evolution and Purpose of OASIS In order to provide background inform ation to inform debate on OASIS and its applications over the next se veral y ears, the f ollowing seve ral paragraphs present key points about OASIS and its history. The preceding m aterial in this volum e has \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO 15 summarized the m ajor im pacts of using OASIS data to enhance patient outcom es through the application of the OBQI fram ework. This subsection re peats a few ts and focuses exclusively on OASIS, summ arizing why and how it was developed. a. OASIS Purpose, Content, and Research : The purpose of OASIS rests with the prim ary reason why (hom e) health care is provided. Stripping away issues such as regulation, paym ent, cost, utilization, and st affing, health care is provided to benefit people. Since outcom es are bas ically ch ange s in health status between two tim e points (such as start of care and disc harge from care), the fundam ental purpose of health care is to positively influence patient outcom es. OASIS was carefully designed for m easuring and ultim ately enhancing patient outcom es. All (non-identifier) item s in OASIS were derived by first specifying a set of patient outcom es considered critical by hom e care e xperts (e.g., nurses, physicians, therapists, socia l workers, adm inistra tors) for evalua ting the effectiv eness of care. These ou tcom es were chosen from the m ost im portant dom ains of health status addressed by hom e care providers. Most data item s in OASIS were developed, tested in hundreds of agencies, and refined for m easuring outcom es in order to evaluate and enh ance the effectiven ess of home care. This has been and rem ains the fundam ental purpose of OASIS. The general categories of da ta and health s tatus item s in OASIS include dem o- graphics and patient history, living arrangem ents, supportive assistance, sensory status, integum entary atus, elim ination status, neuro/em otional/ behavioral status, activitie daily living, m edications, equipm ent m anagem ent, and information collec ted at inpa tient f acility ad mission or agen cy disch arge. Each of these general categories was deem ed necessary to properly m easure and evaluate those patient outcom es judged to be m ost pivotal in exam ining the effectiveness of hom e care. To properly m easure outcom es as changes in pa tient health status over tim e, most OASIS data item s are design ed to be collected at start of care and every two months thereafter until and including tim e of discharge. Not only were sev eral m ultidisciplinary clin ical panels convened to subs tantively review and revise sets of the m ost im porta nt outcom e measures, but OASIS data item s and m easurem ent m ethods also were rev iewed by m ultidisciplinary p anels of research methodologists, clinicians, hom e care m anage rs, and policy analysts. As OASIS data items were em ployed in research projects a nd subsequently in dem onstration projects, reliability and validity tes ting was undertak en with a view toward enhancing accu racy and utility. Selected item s, including som e that were added (af ter the in itial r esearch was completed) at the request of industry representatives, rem ain problem atic in term s of precision or accuracy and shou ld be regarded as candidate s for future revision. The OASIS Chronicle in Volum e 4 reviews each item and provides recomm endations for future refinem ents that would best occur at sch eduled intervals of every few years. b. Guiding Princ iples for OASIS Developm ent and Ref inement: OASIS is the only m ajor data set ever developed for a la rge com ponent of our health care delivery system that has been focus ed first and forem ost on measuring and im proving outcom es on behalf of patien ts. This is the p rimary principle that has guided the evolution of OASIS over its 15-year history. A set of seven additional operating principles, which \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO 16 evolved iteratively du ring the early s tages of OASIS developm ent, becam e established as basic tenets of the OASIS developm ental pr ocess and its various applications; they can serve as gu idelines for the con tinued ev olution of OASIS. The seven guiding principles (secondary to the above guiding prin ciple of outcom e enhancem ent) are: OASIS should be a precise, uniform data se t tailored to the unique features of hom e health care. This data set should be an integral part of the com prehensive assessm ents providers routinely conduct in their daily operations (as required by the Medicare Conditions of Participation). Scientific m ethods and standards m ust be em ployed in all phases of OASIS developm ent and ongoing refinem ent. Developm ent and continued evolution of OASIS should be consistent with the conceptually d erived and clinically va lidated applications fram ework, term ed Outcom e-Based Quality Im provem ent. OASIS data item s should be useful for m easur ing or risk adjusting each m easure in a system of outcom es that serv es as the bas is for repo rts that are und erstand able and of practica l valu e to c linician s, manage rs, and hom e care agencies in g eneral. The agency-level applications of OASIS shoul d constitute a system that fosters self- improve ment, evolution, and provider ownership over the course of tim e. Modifications to the OASIS data syst em should be undertaken carefully and rigorously, after analyzing the system impacts of such changes and em pirically testing them prior to the ir implem entation. In addition to the prim ary objective of enhancing outcom es of hom e care, continued developm ent and refinem ent of the OASIS data system should anticipate possible current and em erging applications in areas such as inform ing consum ers, clinical manage ment, agency m arketing, m onitori ng and rem edying fraud and abuse, facili - tating voluntary accreditation, developing progressively bett er outcom e measures for clinical and evaluative purposes, im proving case m ix adjustm ent for paym ent, improving risk adjustm ent for outcom e measurem ent, increasing efficiency and effectiveness of survey a nd certification, detecting di scrim ination and access barriers to hom e care, determ ining im pacts of paym ent policies, and m onitoring the needs of recip ients of hom e care. These prin ciples were used in gu iding research and operational activities that entailed em pirica lly tes ting sev eral versions of OASIS data item s and outcom es in more than 400 home care agencies, with the input of m ore than 1200 home care providers, managers, and adm inistrators. Input also was received from Medicare and Med icaid officials, policy analysts, consum er repres entativ ental ental organizations with interests in (possible) OASIS applic ation s. The cur rent OASIS data item s constitute those d eemed m ost essential f or implem enting an ef outcom e enhancem ent a ssuran ce sys tem at the \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO 17 home health agency level -- one that also can serve as the f oundation for strengthening the quality im prove ment and assurance appro aches for the entire Medicare program (and state-level Medicaid program s). D. RECENT PROGRAM DEVE LOPM ENTS AND P RESENT CONCERNS 1. National Developments in OASI S and OBQI Program Applications Owing to prelim inary findings from the OBQI demonstrations and the value of OASIS data for case m ix adjusting paym ent rates under PPS, in m id-1999 HCFA mandated OASIS data collection for skilled le vel patients at all ce rtified agenc ies, and electronic transm ission (to state agen cies) of such data for Medicare and Medicaid patients. CMS is now m oving forward with planning for OBQI nationally. CMS's national orientation and training program s for OASIS data collection and OBQI are patterned after analogous program s used in the dem onstration tria ls. Under nationwide implementation, training and data m anage ment program s have been and will continue to be adm inistered at th e state level. OASIS data are tran smitted to a s tate agency and then to a cen tral national repos itory for outcom e reporting and case m ix adjusting paym ent rates. At this writing, (1) case m ix and adverse event repo rts have been m ade available electronically to a ll cer tified agencies in the United S tates, (2 ) OASIS data have been used for case m ix adjustm ent during the first year of prospective pa yment, and (3) plan- ning has been com pleted for national OBQI training and for the fi rst round of risk- adjusted outcom e reports for all certified agencies in early 2002. The national outcom e reports will se rve as the basis for volun tary OBQI activities at the agency level. They also will assis t the Medicare survey and certification process by providing m ore specific inform ation to iden tify strong hom e health program s that need relatively little attention a s well as prog rams in need of greater im provem ent. A pilot program is underway to facilitate the involvem ent of QIOs in assis ting hom e health agen - cies to im plem ent and use OBQI for outcom e enhancem ent. This program also builds on the train ing and technical assistance approach es used in th e dem onstration trials. In addition to OASIS applications developed by CMS, OASIS-based outcom e measures are now being used by m any accredited hom e health agen cies p articipating in the Join t Comm ission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations' ORYX program that focuses on perform ance indicators. As experience is g ained with outcom e reports designed for hom e health agency use, curren t CMS plans assum e that som e vers ion of OASIS-based outcom e reports will be available to the public. While public reportin g on perform ance of h ealth care providers is controversial in som e sectors, a general te ndency toward such reporting is apparent.38, 39 Initial experience with OBQI reports f or al l certified agencies would be a reason able prerequ isite before pub lic reporting is im plem ented and, according to pub licly released CMS plans, hom e health agencies will be ab le to acquire th is exp erience pr ior to the release of consum er reports. \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO 18 2. Concerns Expressed about OASIS a. Paym ent System Changes as a Cataly st for OASIS Concerns : While nearly all non -iden tifier OASIS item s are used f or OBQI, only selected OASIS data item s currently are used to case m ix adjust pe r-episode paym ents under the recently im ple- mented PPS for certified agencies. Some industry representatives have suggested reducing OASIS to only those item s currently used for paym ent and elim inating other OASIS item s used for OBQI (and for potentia l future refinem ents to case m ix adjustm ent of paym ent rates). The dem onstration findi ngs suggest this woul d be a disservice to patients, providers, and payers concerned about quality m onitoring and im provem ent. It is, however, understandable that concerns have arisen related to the burden of OASIS data collection, encoding, and transm ission on the part of hom e health agencies. These concerns (discussed in m ore detail shortly) also have resulted in suggestions to elim inate OASIS altogether, reduce the frequency of data collection, or restrict the types of patients on whom OASI S data are collected. One reason for industry concern is the fact that Medicare revenues for hom e health care were reduced by over 50% under IPS between 1997 and 2000. Anothe r is the unfortunate but f actual coincidence that the national m andate for OASIS data collection o ccurred toward the end of this period. The powerful im pact of IPS on the hom e care indus try is evident from the fact that nearly one-th ird of all hom e health agencies closed or withdrew from the Medicare program between 1997 and 2000. In all, the inopportune announcem ent of HCFA's OASIS mandate during the concluding, m ost severe phase of IPS produced the understandable conclusion by m any in the industry that OASIS was a designed accom panim ent of IPS, or at least a harbinger of additional governm ental paperwork and burden that would further complicate rather than solve prob lems in the future. In addition, because OASIS was to be us ed for case m ix adjustm ent under a hom e health care prospective paym ent system that was Congressionally m andated to imm e- diately follow IPS, certified hom e health agen cies were requ ired to im plem ent OASIS data co llection and tr ansm ission in accord with an extrem ely am bitious schedule. These two factors -- the conclusion of IPS concurrent with the OASIS m andate and the am bi- tious im plem entation schedule for OASIS (announced in January and June 1999 regula - tions) -- led to far m ore concern about OASIS than otherwise would have been the case. b. Natural Res istance to Change Despite Pre-IPS Receptivity : Three versions of OASIS had been released for public review a nd reaction during the four years prior to the implementation of IPS; all re ceived a generally positive re action. In fact, a num ber of nondem onstration agencies had voluntarily implem ented OASIS and OASIS-based quality im provem ent prior to th e HCFA m andate. Before the shift to IPS took place, the home health industry was generally suppor tive of OASIS and exhibited a sense of ownership of this data set that was devel oped specifically with the needs of hom e care agencies in m ind. This support was evidenced by the statem ents and activities of individ - ual agencies, s tate prov ider a ssociations, and national provider associations (such as the National Association for Hom e Care), which sponsored a variety of educational program s for their m embers on im proving quality through outcom e measurem ent and OASIS applications during the m id-1990s. \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, , Den ver, CO dif ficult, p articularly if it af fects the very infrastructure of an organi - zation in the contex t of increasing ly scarce re sources. It is from the vantage point of being required to establish a new data syst em and way of thinking with far fewer dollars from the dom inant payer that m any in th e hom e health care industry are com menting about OASIS today. There is a tendency to vi ew the OASIS data set sim ply as a set of items that requ ires a giv en am ount of sp ace on paper and has a given num ber of boxes to check. This view results in criticism of th e data item s and questions about why they are collected. Some even blam e the hom e care nursing shortage on OASIS, despite the fact that the shortage is at least as severe in s everal other m odalities of health care (e.g., the hospita l field) in which OASIS is not a factor. Unfortunately, in the wake of IPS and now under PPS, m any in the hom e care field ha ve little understandi ng of how and why OASIS has evolved, what this data set is goi ng to be us ed for, its sign ificant v alue to home care agencies and their patien ts, its utility f or m aking res ource allocation and staffing decisions, and its long- term merits for the Medicare and Medicaid program s -- which m erits, in tu rn, will benef it the indu stry. c. Concerns about the Burdens of Data Collection, Encoding, and Transm ission : As indicated, various concerns have been voiced abou t the burden of OASIS data collection. A num ber of clinicians and indus try representatives poi nt out that the OASIS data set requires m ore pages th an previously were containe d in pa tient as sessm ent forms. Some also contend that OASIS substantially increases asse ssment tim e. In addition to assessm ent or data collection burden, the concer n has been raised th at com puterizing and encoding OASIS data is a new burden particul arly b ecaus e many agencies heretofore d id not com puterize clin ical reco rds. Even for those that did, electronic transm ission of patien t health status data wa s not required. Hence, the cont ention h as been m ade that the new PPS was not designed to cover adequate ly the cost of OASIS data collection, encoding, and transm ission. d. Suggestions to Restrict OASIS Data Collection to Selected Patients : The requirem ent to collect OASIS data that wa s issued in 1999 pertains to all adult, non- maternity skilled care patients (excluding, for exam ple, patients receiving only personal care), rega rdless of payer, adm itted to Medicare-certif ied hom e health agen cies. Agencies are free to collect OAS IS data for all other nonskille d or personal care patients if they choose to do so. Only data on Me dicare and Medicaid skilled patients are requir ed to be tran smitted to the state and subsequen tly to the OASIS national repository. When procedures to ensure sufficient confid entiality a re finalized and a f inal regu latory notice is issued, cu rrent plan s call f or tran smitting OASIS data on a ll other skilled c are (i.e., non-Medicare and non-Medi caid) patients. OASIS da ta patien ts pre sently tr ansm itted to the s tate m ust have m asked identif iers. The 1999 m andate indicates no decision has been m ade regarding potential OASIS requirem ents for nonskilled care patients. Further inform ation has no t been released on this topic. In view of th e earlier concerns voiced about burden, som e suggestions have been m ade to elim inate the OASIS requ irement for Medicaid skilled patients and other non-Medicare skilled patients, and not to pu rsue OASIS data collection for any other types of patients, including but not restricted to Medi caid personal care p atients. \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO 20 e. Requests to Reduce OASIS Based on Interrat er Reliab ility or Va lidity : In the interest of reducing a num ber of OASIS data item s, concerns have been expressed that selected item s are unreliable and should be e liminated. As will be discussed shortly, some of the concerns abou t reliability a re reason able and sp eak to either ref inement of selected item s or even elim ination of a few items if they cannot be im proved sufficiently. Questions have also been raised about the clinical and analytic validity of OASIS in searching for item s to recomm end for deletion. 3. Analysis of Concerns Expressed about OASIS a. Lack of Awareness about the Value of OASIS : As the hom e health agencies participating in OBQI dem onstrations disc overed, OASIS represents a significant solu - tion to num erous problem s, including thos e caus ed by IPS. Because OASIS was developed prim arily for hom e care providers , one of its aforem entioned guiding prin - ciples was that OASIS and its outcom e enha ncem ent applications m ust be of practical value and m esh with the day-to-day operations of hom e care agencies. It must yield reports and too ls that ag ency staff can use to evaluate the ir own ef fectiven ess in inves ting resources on behalf of their patients. Repor ts had to be sufficien tly practical and under - standable so that agencies can change and reallocate re sources, both to produce better outcom es and to control and m inimize costs in doing so. That this is possible has been shown under the OBQI dem onstration program s. OASIS can be used by agency s taff to monitor poten tial chang es in case m ix so that approaches to care can be altered sys tematically in accord with the changing n eeds of patients. In addition to the forthcom ing ri sk-adjusted outcom e reports, agencies can now access advers e event ou tcom e reports reflecti ng the frequency with which a v ariety of untoward events (such as em ergent care for wound infection or deteriorating wound status, developm ent of a urinary tract infect ion, or substantial decl ine in manage ment of oral m edications) occur. Such events can be m onitored efficiently through OASIS, providing agencies with critical inform ation in order to inve stigate where they occu r for individual patients. Furthe r, OASIS not only can result in m anage ment decisions on how best to invest lim ited r esourc es in p atient care, but it also can con tribute to reduc ing to tal health system costs through enhanced outcom es, such as reduction in hospitalizat ion rates for hom e care patients. The m ain point that em erges from the pr esent climate of concern about OASIS is twofold. First, OASIS is far less a part of the problem than it is a significant com ponent of the solution. The fact that it is popular with those who have im plem ented and used it for a reasonab le period of tim e is a testam ent to its utility, ev en in a f inancially constrained env ironm ent. Second, becau se the hom e health industry has b een over- whelm ed by and preoccupied with the effects of paym ent changes and constraints, m ost individu als hav e not had the opportunity to assess the value of OASIS for m ultiple purposes. Therefore, the fact that OASIS, in reality, rep resents both inte rmediate and long-run solutions to current problem s is largely unknown in the hom e care industry. \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO 21 b. OASIS Burden in Light of Proper Im plem entation and Needed Change : Demonstration Experience: None of the agen cies in th e aforem entioned demonstration program s, in which agencies re ceived no financial as sistance to im plem ent or m aintain the OASIS data sy stem , wit hdrew becaus e of OASIS-related bu rdens o r costs. This also was true for nearly all nondem onstration agencies that voluntarily im ple- mented OASIS before the federal m andate. It has becom e clear, however, that agencies that do not properly im plem ent OASIS from the perspectives of (1) efficient integ ration of data item s into th e curr ent assessm ent, (2 ) adequate training and orientation of staff, (3) adequ ate comm unication with staff rega rding the purposes and value of OASIS, and (4) anticipating the n atural resistance that occu rs on the part of clin ical staff to any such change, will naturally struggle and, in m any in stances, perceive that OASIS represents an extrem ely costly or burdensom e undertaking. Long-Standing Medicare Requirement : In keep ing with the pr imary responsibility of the Medicare program to its beneficiaries, the Medicare Conditions of Participation have long include d the requirem ent that servic es provided by a hom e health agency follow a plan of care, which m ust have the following attributes: Standard : Plan of care. The plan of care developed in consultation with the agency staff covers all pertinen t diagno ses, including m ental status, types of services and equipm ent required, freque ncy of visits, prognosis, rehabilitation potential, rotect ry, instru ctions for tim ely disch arge o r referral, and any other appropriate item s. (Source: CFR 42-484.18, revision effective August 1991) In order to es tablish a p lan of care with th ese attributes, a c linician m ust com plete what is referred to as a com prehensive ass essment. The m ost recent regu lation clarifies th is responsibility and m akes it m ore specific a nd uniform by requiring that a com prehensive assessm ent includ e OASIS.25 The new regulation e assessm ents at tw o-month follow-up tim e points in addition to discharge and start of care. It is im portant to no te this is not an OASIS requ irement; rathe r, it is a cla rified com prehensiv e assessm ent requirem ent that is m andated for Medicare beneficiaries. Research and de monstration experience has shown that m any agencies were not p reviously m eeting th e comprehensive as sessm ent requirem ent even at start of care. Now that it has been re-em phasized in the m ost recent regulation, clarifying that items such as those in OASIS should be included, som e agenci es necessarily require more tim e to conduct patient assessm ents that are superior to the assessm ents conducted previously. Inaccurate Perception of OASI S and Data Collection Burden: A sign ificant misconception about OASIS is that it is a ponderous data set including num erous new items that subs tantially in crease tim e spent in asse ssing pa tients. In fact, OASIS contain s very few new item s that were not already part of agenc ies' clin ical records -- assum ing prehensive assessm ents were already being conduc ted. The OASIS item s are typ ically m ore precisely word ed than com parable item s previously in cluded in agencies' assessm ent form s. This preci sion, in turn, enhances the accuracy of assessm ent, im proves care planning, and perm its uniform evaluation of patient outcom es. \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO 22 OASIS item s should replace, rath er than a ugment, item s that were p reviously in agencies' clinical reco rds. A typical clin ical record resulting from a valid com prehensive assessm ent includes over 200 items. Using OAS IS item s instead of extant item s means that half of the item s in an agency's clinical record are replaced. Although m ore paper is usually added to the ass essment form with OAS IS, the total num ber of item s is rela tively unchanged, and they typically require no m ore time for data collection. That is, once a provider is fam iliar with the item s, it is ofte n only necessary for a particu lar option (e.g., level on a health s tatus scale) to be checked, without m aking narrative notes regarding the patient's condition. Research and exp erience indi cates that when assessm ents contain ing OASIS item s are used, ther e is a shift in the am ount of tim e spent com pleting assessm ents in patients' hom es versus time spent on out-of-hom e activities (such as docum entation, form completion, and care coordination activities that do not have to be done during hom e visits). A tim e study found th at, for clinicians who previously had been conducting valid com prehensive assessm ents, the increased tim e spent in patients' homes when using form s that included OASIS item s was offset by less out-of-hom e tim e because the objective and sys tematic checkl ist form at of OASIS item s elim inated the need for extensive narrative do cumentation. Therefore, desp ite the fact that OASIS item s occupy m ore space on paper, they do not n ecessa rily in crease to tal provid er tim e spent in completing and docum enting an assessm ent unless the assessm ent approach had previously been inadequate. Conclusions Regarding Different Types of OASIS Burdens: In sum mary, several concerns regarding OASIS-relate d burden are inappropriate or unfounded. However, others are not. There are vali d start-up costs relate d to training, form s developm ent, and integration of OASIS into day-to-day operations of agency clinical activities. There is a learning process or learning curve that is real. Such costs should be or should have been adequately covered. It is not clear this has been the case. Time required to com puterize and transm it OASIS da ta, even if the free CMS software (i.e., HAVE N) is used, is a new cost incurred by m any agencies. Whether Medicare should pay for the costs of com puterization or en coding such data (apart from subsequent transm ission) is a dilem ma. Some more t echnologically advanced agencies had already concluded that com puterization of clinical information was a cos t-effective clinic al and business strategy prior to the OASIS m andate. Data transm ission, however, is a require - ment that follows directly from the recen t federal regu lation. Altho ugh it is not strictly an the clarif ication that com prehensive assessm ents m ust be done at follow-up points m ay increase staff tim e for so me agencies that h ad prev iously no t been thoroughly docum enting health status at such ti me points. Despite the fact that certified agencies have now been co llecting, enc oding, and transm itting OASIS data for som e time, it seem s appropria te to rev isit som e of these costs and assess whether they are adequately covered under the current paym ent system . c. Restricting OASIS to Specific Patien ts in View of CMS and Agency Respon- sibilities : Some reasonable con cerns und erpin the suggestions to m inimize the types of patients to which the OASIS m andate should pe rtain. The suggestions regarding skilled patients and nonskilled (i.e., personal care) pa tients, while often presented together, are \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO 23 basically quite different and should be analyzed separate ly. Deliberations on issues related to OASIS data f or sk illed ca re pa tients shou ld tak e into c onsid eration th e research and dem onstration experience. Demonstration Experience: All hom e care agencies in the dem onstrations as well as other agencies that im plem ented OB QI in the late 1990s collected data on all patients regardless of payer source. One of the prim ary advantages in doing so, from an agency's p erspectiv e, is receiving ou tcom e and related reports on its entire caseload. This perm its m anagers to m ake better info rmed decisions about resource m anagem ent on behalf of patients, taking an ag ency's total cos t structu re and tota l utilization pictur e into consideration. From a clinical viewpoint, ag ency staff are not requ ired to use different forms for different types of patients. This uniformity helps in designing agency-wide (and therefore m ore efficient) approaches to care planning, care coordination, and the provision and m onitoring of care -- part icularly f or sk illed ca re pa tients. CMS Oversight Mandate: Beyond agency-specific considerations, the responsibility of CMS to m onitor the quality of care prov ided by hom e health agencies certified by Medicare was discu ssed in Section A. This res ponsibility is well established within the Social Security Act [Sec. 1861(o )(6) and Sec. 1891(b)]. It is not lim ited to patients for whom the payer is Medicare or Medi caid. The rationale for this, in part, rests with the principle that when the federal gove rnment takes on the res ponsibility to certify home health to p rovide care to M edicare beneficiaries, it also m ust assum e the responsibility to ensure that CMS paym ent practices and othe r procedures do not adversely or differentially im pact Medicare and non-Medicare patients. Cause for Concern about Quality: As has been discussed, under the current paym ent environm ent (PPS), as well as the immediately preceding paym ent system (IPS), there is little doubt that patte rns of care have changed in th e vast m ajority of hom e health care agencies across the c ountry. What has happened to both Medicare and non- Medicare patients in term s of outcom es is relatively unknown except for selected anecdotes and relatively sketchy inform ation about service provision. Available inform ation suggests that while the total num ber of hom e health care visits dropped between 1997 and 1999, the num ber of deficienci es in care increased over this sam e period.40 Thus, because strong incentives exis t under PPS to redu ce services, it is possible that a num ber of agencies m ay provide less adequate care to Medicare patients. Agencies in terested p rimarily in prof it maximization will have the incentive to adm it as many Medicare patients as possible, m inimizing services provided so as to m aximize profit under PPS. This can resu lt not only in inferior outcom es for Medicare patients, but in reduced access for non-Med icare sk illed care patien ts in particular (e.g., lower admission rates for particular types of patients whose c are is cos tly relativ e to paym ents received) since profits m ay not be as substantial for non-Medicare patients. The Need to Monitor Outcomes for Skilled Care Patients: Without OASIS data co llected on M edicare and non -Med icare sk illed care patients alike, PPS m ay create an undetected two-class hom e health care delivery system for public- vs. nonpublic-pay (skilled care) patients. We may not learn definitively of this system or how to rem edy it until it ha s caused m any years of dam age. Because hom e care serves a high ly vulne rable \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO 24 population, this is an extrem ely serious con cern. Further, public or consum er reporting on outcom e indicators based only on Medicare pa tients will not be n early as inf ormative to consum ers as reporting based on an agency's entire caseload, or at leas t its skilled care caseload. Therefore, it would not be advisabl e to elim inate Med irement. it woul d be beneficia l to pro ceed with data trans- mission for non-Medicare and non-Medicaid skil led care patients as soon as m ethods to ensure conf identiality of data f or such p atients are suf ficiently de velop ed. Proceeding Delibera tely with Nons killed or Personal Care Patients: The most valid con cerns raised in restricting OASIS data collec tion appear to be those that focus on nonskilled care patients. For patients receiving exclusively services that are not regard ed as sk illed, the OASIS data s et, developed prim arily for m easuring outcom es of skilled hom e health care services, m ay better serve assessm ent and outcom e monitoring objectives if it is ta ilored more uniquely to the characteristics and care needs of nonskilled care patien ts. Because little is known about th e outcom es of patients receiving only nonskilled care, specific info rmation is lacking to guide refinem ents in this regard. Therefore, it appears reasonab le to d elay a decision on requiring a (possibly revised) version of OASIS for personal care patients. d. Reliability Considerations and Po tential Revisions to OASIS Through Continued Reliability Ana lyses: It is no t the inten t in this vo lume to delve in to detail on individual data item s. Volum e 4 contains inform ation on reliability (and validity) for every OASIS data item , along with a reco mmendation for continued use or change. Supporting Docum ent 2 in Volum e 3 contains the find ings from a recent reliability study. Some general points about relia bility a re app ropriate, however. First, three separate OASIS interrater reliabilit y studies have been conducted in the recent past. Prior to these studies, p reliminary re liability and con sistency analyses contributed to the initial wording, form at, and instructions asso ciated with m ost OASIS data item s. Description of Interrater Reliabil ity through Independent Assessments: Each of the three recen t interrater reliability st udies had its own unique design, sam ple size, and research app roach. Two of the three studies used ind ependen t interrater ass essments, and one used concu as m asse ssment approach is reg arded a s preferable and m ost appropriate . This approach involves tw o separa te raters (assess ors) colle cting inf ormation on the sam e patien t at two different tim e points. The tim e points should be as close together as possible, and the raters are not expected to share inform a- tion abou t the pa tient. A poten tially se rious w eakness with th is appro ach can arise if the two assessm ents are excess ively far apart in time (in order to avoid patient fatigue or due to tr avel logis tics and tim e constrain ts) because p atients ' hea lth s tatus can chang e between the two tim e points, particularly for Med icare h ome health pa tients who are often characterized by acute, unstable conditions. Longer time periods between assess - ments are less problem atic with chronic ca re patients, such as non-Medicare hom e care patients or nursing hom e patients, whose cond itions are m ore stable over tim e. The maximum pref erred tim e interv al be tween indep endent asses sments for skilled hom e care patien ts is 24 hours. To th e extent th at th is time interval is exceed ed by an interrater reliability study design, it tends to p roduce bias ed reliability coefficien ts that under- estim ate true in terrater reli ability b ecaus e change in pa tient condition over tim e is not sufficiently con trolled. \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, , Den ver, CO 25 Description of Interrater Reliabil ity through Concurrent Assessments : The concurrent interrater reliab ility approach entails one ra ter (assessor) conducting the patient assessm ent and the other rater li stening and observing, without com menting or communicating in any way during the assessm ent and without sharing inform ation with the prim ary assessor after th e assessm ent. Both raters or ass essors record the ass essment inform ation independently. The weakness asso ciated with this app roach is th at th e secondary assessor is constrained to the approach and style of the first assessor. This would tend to create a bias in the direction of inflated reliability. However, this can be offset by the fact that the p erceptual and in terpretive sk ills of the two individuals can be sufficiently d ifferent so th eir reco rdings are more disparate when one is constrained only to the cu es re sulting f rom the other's c ommunication style instead of his or her own communication style (which m ight be m ore lik ely to p roduce closer ass essment ratings to the firs t asses sor). Thus , the con current assessm ent approach m ay yield inaccurate reliability estim ates due to th ese factors, but the direc tion of the inaccu racy is less c lear. Error Introduced through Inexp erienced Assessors: A challenge in both types of interr ater reliability app roache s (i.e., independent and concurrent assessm ents) is that uncontrolled variation can be in trodu ced when the asses sors are not sufficiently trained and experienced in the application of the proper assessm ent techniques and data item s. This variation in rater ability superim poses noise or random error that exacerbates the (true) unreliability of the item (s) being te sted, tending to result in underestim ates of actual item -specific reliab ility co efficients. Designs of the Two OASIS Reliability Studies that Used Independent Assess - ment: One OASIS interrater reliab ility study that has received wide circulation to date is an independent assessm ent reli ability study which allowed for up to three-day intervals between asse ssments and em ployed a num ber of assessors with vary ing degre es of ability and experience in using OASIS. Based on these design characteristics, it is lik ely th at the reliability estim ates from this study underes timate the true reliability of OASIS item s. The interrater reliability resu lts for OASIS data item s in the OASIS Chronicle found in Volum e 4 are based prim arily on an independent assessment approach that us ed a sm aller sample of patients, but a m ore rigor ous des ign, perm itting a m aximum of 24 hours between assessm ents that were conducted by a lim ited num ber of trained clinicians. Overview of Findings: Interr ater reliability f or th e vast m ajority of OASIS items, particu larly m ost item s used f or im portant applications in outcom e measurem ent and risk adjustm ent of outcom e measures, is adequate and, in m any areas, excellent. However, som e items are unreliable and eith er should be elim inated or not used until their reliability is im proved -- as suggested in Volum e 4. e. Validity of OASIS and OBQI : Validity is at least a s important as re liability for m ost OASIS application s. The m ore c onsequential types of validity for the OASIS data se t, in view of the prim ary focus on enhancing patient outcom es, are consensual and predictive/convergent validity. Briefly, m ost item s underwent several rounds of review by expert clinical and research panels who focused on their u tility f or bo th patient asses s- ment and outcom e measurem ent or risk adjustm ent. This approach to consensual validity was com plemented by validation through em pirical testing that resulted from using the \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO outcom e measures in the OBQI dem onstrations, where they were judged useful by hundreds of clinicians for patie nt assessm ent and care planning purposes, as well as ou tcom e enhancem ent. Convergent or predictive validity was assessed through hypothesis testing which involved estim ating risk-ad justed m odels fo r each outcom e measure. Models typ ically included between 10 and 50 risk factors whose si gns and coefficients were consistent and clinically m eaningf ul across all m odels. The fact that the en tire OASIS-based sys tem of outcom e measures and risk factors led to an integrated quality im provem ent approach that was validated through outcom e enhan cement, and which was widely accep ted by home care providers, is perhap s the strongest form of valid ation. Some of the concerns expressed about clinical accep tability of specific OASIS data item s are addressed in Volum e 4. It is im portant to note here, how ever, tha t clinical utility and va lidity were given the highest priority throughout the developm ent and testing phases of OASIS, as docum ented in Volum e 3 of this report. f. The Potential Burdens if Extensiv e Changes Are M ade to OASIS in the Ne ar Future : It is im portant to recogn ize that OASIS data collection and reporting have been in place for a reasonable period of tim e. Therefore, changing OASIS, the nature of the assessm ents, or the protocols involved in co llecting OASIS inform ation has a substantial cost for hom e health agencies. A signif icant burden would result from changing assess - ment for ms and data collection procedures, retraining, altering data encoding or com pu- terization procedures, changing software, and revising data m onitoring and reporting methods. Most of this burden would be born e by hom e health agency staff. Hence, even moderate chang es in OASIS at this tim e likely will b ring abou t a sign ificant nega tive response by m any clinical staff and hom e health agency adm inistrators, especially staff from the extrem ely larg e num ber of agencies that currently are collecting and using su ch data and have heretofore not com plained to CMS. It is possible that the negative response about these new burdens would exceed the concerns currently being expressed about OASIS burden. Equally im portant, OASIS cannot be sim ply pared down without several negative ramifications for CMS applicat ions. Reductions in item s or data collection tim e points, specifically if they include any of (num erous ) pivotal item s, coul d require significant changes in term s of (1) risk adjustm ent for outcom e measures need ed for public reporting and agency-level outcom e reporting, (2) CMS ev aluation of quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries, (3) future refinem ents of th e initial c ase m ix adjustm ent approac h for prospective paym ent, (4) outcom e-based survey and certification a pplications, (5) revi- sions to software and software system s, (6) the various data m anage ment and statistical system s currently in p lace, (7) program safegua rd and integrity activ ities, and (8) emerg- ing responsibilities of QIOs under their Sevent h Scope of W ork. Just as consequential would be the reduced opportunities for im proved clinical m anagem ent, enhanced outcom es, and m ore effective adm inistrati on in hom e health agencies -- as well as lessened opportunities for phys icians, discharge planners, and case m anagers to m ake more inform ed referral dec isions. \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO 27 E. RECOMMENDATIONS ON EVOL UTIO N AND REFINEMENT OF OASIS APPLICATIONS 1. A Continuous Quality Improvement Sy stem Whose Underlying Data Set Has Multiple Applicat ions a. The Overarch ing Goal : The research and developm ental program that has given rise to OBQI and OASIS should be viewed realisticall y. To date, the program has focused on establishing the feasibility and ut ility of a CQI appro ach to ensu ring th at home health care patient outcom es are evaluated continually and im proved where necessary. The OBQI m ethodology designed for this purpose was developed, tested, and shown to be succes sful on a large scale ov er a period of several years. The res earch efforts were targeted at dev eloping a CQI sy stem that works at the hom e health agency level, and never wavered in this regard. The overall goal was to develop an approach to evaluating and continuous ly im proving quality that would serve m ultiple purpos es for home health ag encie s, sim ultaneous ly cont ributing to im proving CMS quality m onitoring system s. If properly im plem ented and m aintained at a n ational leve l, OBQI has the strong potential to accom plish th is goal. Cons equently, and especia lly in view of the incentives to deleteriously w ithhold or reduce services under PPS, the decision to m ove forward with prom oting OBQI on a national ba sis is not only evid ence-based, bu t it is targeted at solving the m ost serious pr oblem s facing hom e care patients today. b. Inform ation Dissem ination and Infrastruc ture Changes : The ram ifications of the decision to im plem ent OBQI nationally are m any. It is im portant that the hom e health industry fully understand what OBQI is, including the interm ediate and long-term purposes it serves. As nati onal OBQI training and inform ation prom ulgation begin, the extent to which OBQI fosters not only greater effectiven ess of hom e health care, but also can lead to increased efficiency and im prove d staff m orale -- should be m ade known. All should recog nize that this process, incl uding collecting and transm itting the necessary data as well as receiving and analyzing outc ome reports, takes tim e to settle in, and, as with any system ic change, will no t nec essarily be well rece ived du ring its im plem entation and accomm odation stages within ev ery hom im plem ent OBQI, inf rastruc ture cha nges within bo th in dividual hom e health agencies and CMS program s are necessa ry. Many changes have begun and new program s are m oving forward. They are acco mpanied by natu ral resistan ce from hom e care p rovider s that is m anifest in d ifferent ways. It is tem pting to try to r eturn to old er, more comfortable ways of doing business, providing care, m onitoring quality, and regu - lating hom e health care. It also is natural to attempt to sim plify as much as possible various com ponents of the process being change d to m ake them at least closely resem ble prior app roach es and ac tivities. Yet, to re turn to prior pr actices o r to reta in cu rrent methods that are becom ing outdated is not possi ble. An approach akin to OBQI m ust be implemented on a nationwide basis in response to growing concerns about the quality of home health care. c. A New and Different Era of Medicare Hom e Health Care : Rega rdless of the argum ents surrounding quality, one indisputable fact necessitates this change -- nam ely, \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO 28 prospective paym ent for Medicare hom e hea lth care. Because of PPS, Medicare hom e health care has chang ed sign ificantly and pe rmanently. Acceptan ce of per-case p an patient care and acceptan ce of the accom panying freedom to blend the types and volum e of services that com es with such paym ent trans late into specific responsib ilities. In particular, p roviders also m ust accept responsibility and accoun t- ability for patien t outcom es that occur over episodes of care for which paym ent is received. Furth er, CMS m ust accept respons ibility and accoun tability for ensuring that adequate is ava ilable to evalu ate ou tcom es of care across paym ent episodes, preferably in a m anner that is useful to hom e health prov iders as well as for external monitoring and regulatory purposes. PPS has us hered in not only a new era of financing home health care under Med icare, but also a new era of accoun tability. It would b e irresponsib le for agencies no t to be accoun table for p atient ou tcom es under this p ayment approach, just as it would be irresponsible for CMS not to evaluate such outcom es on behalf of Medicare beneficiarie s and other patients whose ca re can be influenced by PPS. In short, it is im possible to re turn to or rely on past practices of m onitoring and evaluating quality in view of the powerfu l incentives under this paym ent system that likely will continue for decad es to com e. 2. Accepting the Need fo r Refinements and Proceed ing w ith Applications a. Moving Past OASIS as a Goal Unto Itself : As a m ethodology for evaluating and continually im proving patient outcom es of home health care, OBQI has consid erable potential for th e Med icare progr am and individual hom e health agencies. Unfortunately, it has not been OBQI, but OASIS that has occupied center stage to date. Although under - standab le becau se a un iform data system must be implem ented fi rst, the preoccupation with OASIS has com e to be a distraction and even an im pedim ent to properly under- standing and im plem enting OBQI. Obvious ly, m aintaining the OASIS data sys tem should not be viewed as a goal unto its elf. Neither should CMS staff nor anyone involved in the developm ent of OASIS be defe nsive about its weaknesses. It exists to serve the prim ary purpose of a nationa l OBQI approach that will ben efit pa tients, agencies, and CMS, but to do so effectively, OASIS itself must evolve. Selec ted sho rt- comings in OASIS were apparent by the end of the dem onstration program . OBQI and OASIS had been refined and had evolved over the preceding decade with changes carefully introduced du ring th e demonstrations so that they would be m inimally disrup - tive to ongoing operations. This experience m ade it clear that OBQI, including OASIS, must be im plemented and guided dynam ically, r ecognizing that not onl y is it targeted at continually im proving quality, but that doing so necessita tes continually im proving the approach itself. The need to use specific and reasonably precise inform ation on patient status to case m ix adjust paym ent was obviously an im mediate catalyst for the im plementation of the OASIS data system in 1999-2000. Equally important, however, was the need to have a reason ably accurate and un iform data system in place to s erve the aforem entioned responsibilities and accountabi lities on the part of providers and CMS to evaluate patient outcom es under this paym ent system . Although delaying im plem entation of OASIS would have m ade possible furthe r refinem ents to this already useful data set, this would have been inappropriate, if not im possible. Delaying for th e sake of im provem ents to a \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO 29 system that was already known to be feasib le and effective for its intended purposes would have precluded the tim ely attainm ent of the m ost im portant goal, outcom e monitoring and enhancem ent, which by that tim e had becom e an imperative due to PPS. b. Planning for Change : As stated ear lier, CMS has a considerable range of responsibilities to several constituencies. Most im portant am ong these are its responsi - bilitie s to ind ividual Medica re benef iciaries and recipients of Medicaid services. To carry out these responsib ilities in the hom e care field in a balanced, yet effective m anner under the current circum stances is a consider able challenge. OBQI offers a tool for helping to m eet the challenge, but only if it conti nues to evolve. OBQI and the several applications that follow from it in the cont ext of CMS program s should have an explicitly recognized and perm anent evolutionary com pone nt targeted at (1) ident ifying potential program improvem ents and (2) implementing im provem ents in acco rd with a set of principles that m inimize operational im pacts while m aximizing returns. 3. Suggestions for Moving Forw ard w ith OBQI and OASIS Applications The foundation now exists for a national OB QI program for home health care. The following suggestions are intended to assist in continuing with the im plementation and subsequent m aintenance of the national OBQI system . It is recognized that various CMS and industry activities and program s have already been im plemented. No effort is intended to indicate precis ely how these suggestions s hould be incorporated into activ ities and p rogram s because decis ions on how to do so are bes t made by those who will adm iniste r the p rogram s. a. OBQI Evolution and Ongoing Inform ation Dissem ination : As noted, the inherently changing nature of OBQI n ecessitates acknowledging the need for ongoing refinem ent in the form of a CMS program function to guide its evol ution. This function can be perform ed by a standing committee or operational group within CMS that has the aforem entioned responsibilities to (1) evaluate potential re finem ents and (2) design or suggest operational steps for im plementing those refinem ents to OBQI, OASIS, data collection m ethods, reporting m ethods, and ot her com ponents of the overall system as needed. A process for obtaining input from a variety of sources should be established and m aintained on an ongoing basis. Potentia l changes should be carefully weighed and analyzed in te rms of the tota lity of their im plica patients, and existing adm inistrative progra ms. A preset schedule for im plem enting change on a deliberate (unhurried ) periodic basis, such as ev ery several years, should be followed so that all who are influenced by such change are aware of, can provide input to, and have tim e to prepare for new developm ents. Prior discussion has highlighted what is perhaps the m ost significant barrier to implementing and m aintaining OBQI, includ ing its OASIS data system -- nam ely, a general lack of awareness of specifics regarding the rationale for and operational com po- nents (both agency-level and national) of OB QI. Training and inform ation dissem ination program s have been developed to assist w ith im plem entation. However, these program s also m ust be ongoing because of the dynam ic and changing n ature of OBQI as well as norm al staff turnover within the hom e health care delivery system and the Medicare \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO . Ongoing training and inform ation dissem ination can be W eb-based or elec - tronic in nature, o r can be accom plished th rough m ore traditional appro aches. Efforts of this nature can provide the appropriate vehi cles for comm unicating regular changes in the OBQI system and the program s it influences . Training and inform ation dissem ination activities should, of course , be conducted by both CMS and industry associations and groups. b. Reanalyzing Selected Burden Topics : Issues about OASIS-related burdens incurred by Med icare-certified hom e health agencies have been debated in various forum s. As noted in foregoing sections, seve ral of the industry-voi ced concerns in this area are overstated, but others m ay be valid. It would be reasonable to revisit the bu rden issue, studying carefully and objectively its various facets, and, if appropriate, deter- mining and clarifying precisely how paym ent might be changed to address valid and recurrent inadequacies in paym ent due to OASIS-related burden. This analysis should be based on precise inform ation coll ected in a s cientific m anner, free of potential b iases of self-interest. In conducting su ch an analysis, it is im porta nt to recognize that recent sweeping changes in Medicare paym ent have perm anently altered the cos t structu re and cost behaviors of agencies and indiv idual clinic ians. The f inanc ial capa city to abso rb change and even the m arginal cost of absorb ing such change m ay have been altered since the dem onstration program experience. This is more probable when com paring the early years of the dem onstration experien ce with the m ost re cent (OASIS) data system implementation experience, because the de monstration program was im plemented not under IPS or PPS, but under the form er Medica re cost reim bursem ent approach for hom e health care. c. Revisions Based on Im proving Reliability : Although not as di rectly related to burden, concerns about the reliab ility of selected OASIS data item s also should be care- fully address ed. Here again, s elected con cerns are reason able and o thers are the result of inappropriate conclusions or at ypical experiences. Volum e 4 of this report series, which contain s the OASIS Chronicle and recomm endations for OASIS refine ment, is intended to provide an objective foundati on and vehicle for such refinem ents. This activity is part of the actual process of studying and recomm ending refinem ents over the course of tim e, and would be part of the OBQI evolu tion program function described earlier. d. OASIS and Non-Medicare Patients : For the reasons given in Section D on the value of outcom e reports pertaining to the entire caseload of an agency, an d the s tatutory requirem ent that CMS evaluate quality for both Medicare and non-M edicare patients, the recomm endation is m ade that OBQI (and the OASIS data system ) should continue to be targeted at all adult, nonm aternity patien ts who receive skilled care from hom e health agencies. This would entail continuing with plans to include inform ation on non- Medicare and non-Medicaid skil led ormation on f or such patients data transm ission can be ensured. The increm ental co st of encoding and tr ansm itting th ese add itional da ta shou ld be taken in to account. The final decision for nonskilled patients, however, should continue in abeyance. Revisions to OBQI and OASIS for personal car e patients are being developed and will be \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO 31 empirically tested through a dem onstration tria l in New York State. The results of that experience as they pertain to bo th OBQI a nd OASIS for personal care patients likely will be inform ative. These res ults can be evalua ted and take n into con sideration with in the context of the OBQI evolution pr ogram function described earlier. e. OBQI and System wide Quality of Care : To re alize the f ull po tential of OBQI, home health providers, m embership orga nizations, and CMS should work together to foster the use of outcom e and related report s that will b e available (electronically) to users on request. These reports for indiv idual agencies and their patien ts cons iderab ly extend th e quality assuran ce appro aches that previously have been em ployed in the hom e health care field. They will form a pr ovider-driven foundation for the national OBQI system , which will constitu te, in essenc e, an evo lving pa rtnership b etween the hom e care industry and the Medicare p rogram . This pa rtnership will b enefit patients as well as individual agencies and CMS program s that support hom e health care if OBQI is properly im plemented, m aintained, and refined. f. Using Outcom es in the Survey and Ce rtification P rocess : In addition to inform ing clinical m anage ment and resour ce allocation decis ions with in ind ividua l agencies, the OBQI data system can and s hould be used to strengthen and stream line various com ponents of the current hom e hea lth care survey and ce rtification system , increasing its em phasis on patient outco mes as m andated by the Om nibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-203). As outcom e reports are generated, it will b e possible to lessen the resources devoted to surveying agencies whose outcom es are superior and focus such resources on ag encies whose outcom es need im provem ent. g. Com bined Survey, QIO, and Agency Efforts Focused on Outcom e Improve- ment: With feedback from survey staff, a ssistance from the staff of QIOs, and by virtue of their own em erging outcom e enhancem ent skills, agencies tha t seek to focus on improving specific typ es of patien t outcom es will have the inform ation, input, and extern al assistance to do so. As experience is gained, progressively m ore inform ation can be shared on how to (1) efficiently evalu ate and improve specific patien t outcom es, (2) continue to refocus and streamline the su rvey process, and (3) facilitate QIO assis - tance with agencies' quality im provement pr ogram s. Further, by serving as an OBQI resource for hom e health agencies, QIOs will gain experience in sys tematically monitoring outcom es and directly facilitating outcom e enhancem ent. h. Evaluating PPS Im pacts : At the sam e time, CMS will have and should act on the capacity to evaluate PPS im pacts on patie nt outcom es, case m ix changes over tim e, and case m ix-adjus ted cos t and utilization patterns for both Medicare and (eventually) non-Medicare hom e health care patients receiv ing skilled services. An evaluation should be undertaken of whether PPS has produced a two-class delivery system for Medicare versus non-Medicare patients, analyzing risk-adjusted patient outcom es, case m ix- adjusted use and co sts, and trends in case mix that m ight reflect differential changes in access to hom e health care for Me dicare and non-Medicare patients. i. Outcom e Reporting for Consumers and Ot her Purposes : Modifications to the national outcom e reporting system can be made to produce reports that are under- \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO 32 standable to and useful for the general public. Reports for consum ers could include initially a subset of the outcom es used fo r agency-level OBQI. However, the current outcom e measures are tailored to OBQI applica tions largely to prov ide hom e care s with inf ormation on f airly spec ific health status outcom es for use in problem identification and resolution. It would be appropriate to develop com posite or m ore aggregate outcom e indicators that span sev eral dom ains of health status for ease of understanding by consum ers, either for the initial round of consum er reports or for subsequent refinem ents. After sufficient experience ha s been gained as a result of the first round of outcom e reporting under the national OBQI program , othe r reporting applicati ons would be appro - priate. Specifically, the d egree to which outcom e and case m ix reports are useful to physicians should be assessed. It is possible that outcom e reports s hould be stratified by either patient condition or other factors to be m ore useful for physicians as well as individu al agen cy clinicians and hospital discharge planners or comm unity-based case managers. Outcom e and related reports shoul d be generated to exam ine state-by-state and regional sim ilarities and diss imilarities in outcom es and case m ix. j. Continued Refinem ents to CMS Program Operations : As the OBQI approach and its data system evolve through the abov e-mentioned applications at the individual home health ag ency lev el, various p rogram matic com ponents will con tinue to chang e. Improve ments can be undertaken to render PPS paym ents m ore equitable through refine - ments to the case m ix adjustm ent approach, possibly incorporating additional OASIS data items to produce m ore sensitive adjustm ent. Here also, it would seem that ref inements to case m ix adjustm ent should only occur deliber ately, in acco rd with a regu lar, p reset schedule. OBQI data system and patie nt assessm ent accuracy should continu e to improve in accord with Medicare p rogram integr ity initiatives in ord er to m inimize fraud and abuse. Improved m ethods to determ ine patient eligibility for Medicare and Medicaid services at both start of care and follow-up time points should be system atized in the relatively nea r future. As with case m ix revisions for paym ent pur poses, refinem ents and revisions to risk- adjustm ent methods for outcom e measures us ed in OBQI reports should be undertaken to continually increase the value of outcom e reports for providers. Results from periodic reliability stud ies also can p rovide input to program integrity and surv ey and certification efforts to ensure the accuracy of assessm ents. Merging OASIS data with claim s data as well as other agency- and patient-level data wi ll produce a unified data system that can be used f or multiple adm inistra tive, policy ana lysis, and res earch purpose s. 4. Closing Comment As noted earlier, the overarching goal of OBQI and OASIS is to develop a CQI system that works at the hom e health ag ency level. At the sam e time, the OASIS data can be used for m ultiple additional purposes by agencies and CMS. The foundation for this sys tem is largely in place and can be re fined at relatively low cos t in a structured manner guided by CMS, to the ultim ate benef it of hom e health patients, providers, and CMS program operations. \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO 33 Referen ces 1.

SYNOPSIS AND RATIONAL E FO R THE FOUR-VOLUME REPORT The volum es in the report on OASIS and Outcom e-Based Quality Im provem ent in Hom e Health Care: Research and Dem onstration Findings, Policy Im plications, and Considerations for Future Change are en titled Volume 1: Policy and Program Overview Volume 2: Research and Technical Overview Volume 3: Research and Clinical Supporting Documentation Volume 4: OASIS Chronicle and Recommendations This report series docum ents findings and c onclusions resulting from two large -scale demonstration projects to assess the value of a continuou s qualit y improvem ent (CQI) m ethod- ology to m easure and im prove outcom es of hom e health care. A third project to assist nondem onstration agencies interested in the CQI m ethodolog y supported inform ation dissem i- nation and refinem ents to the approach during and after the latter stages of the dem onstrations. The m ethodology , term ed outcom e-based quality improvem ent (OBQI), was designed prim arily to benefit both Medicare and non-Medicare patients who receive hom e health care. OBQI relies on accurate and uniform inform ation on the health status of patients collected at regular time intervals to m easure the outcom es of care provided. Outcom e measures are adjusted for factors that m ay differentially predispose patients to attaining or not attaining specific outcom es. The second objective of OBQI is to assist hom e care providers to evaluate and im prove their own perform ance. Reports generated through OBQI allow providers to understand and use patient outcom es as perform ance indicators, changing care behaviors to enhance patient outcom es when appropriate. In the interest of readability , the four-volum e report proceeds from general to progres - sively more technical and clinical topics. This necessitates a certain amount of redundanc y among the volum es, particularly the first two (portion s of Volum e 1 are excerpted from or closely para phrase m aterial in Volum e 2). A summ ary of selected topics from Volum e 1 stands apart from the four-volum e set. It highlights m ajor points and conclusions but provides only exceptionally terse discu ssion of the rationale for the m ain conclusions and recomm endations. The first volum e is a relatively brief docum ent intended for a wide audience of individuals interested in (1) how to evaluate the adequac y of hom e health care for Medicare beneficiaries under a pa yment clim ate that has powerful incentives to underprovide services needed by patients, and (2) how to im prove the quality of care in areas for which patient outcom es are poor and should be im proved. An overvie w of the success that is attainable through OBQI to enhance patient outcom es is provided in this docum ent. Volum e 1 is fram ed in the context of issues and events that led to the present-day environm ent for home health care. It is this environm ent and its likely future that the program s at the Centers for Medicare & Medicare Services (CMS) 1must address on behalf o f Medicare and Medicaid recipients. The recom mendations presented in this volum e are based on a 15 - year research and developm ent effort. They are focuse d on ways to guide the continued evolution of the Outcom e and Assessm ent Inform ation Set (OASIS) and, m ost im portantly , the quality monitoring, quality improvem ent, pay ment, certification, and program integrity appli - cations that rely on OASIS. These recomm endations are intended to strike the appropriate balance between CMS' s prim ary responsibility to beneficiaries and its secondary responsi - bilities to other governm ental agencies, providers, payers, com mercial interests, and voluntary accreditation program s. 1 The Heal th Care Financi ng Adm inistration (HCFA) changed its nam e to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in June 2001. Both names (and acronyms) are used in this report depending on context and dates. \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO iii Volum e 2 also is reasonably b rief and highlights the re search appro ach and technical findings from the OBQI dem onstration trials. Written for a m ore technical audience, it summ arizes the research m ethodology , experim ental approach, and statistical findings from the dem onstration. A one-page re search abstract is presented that encapsulates the methods, findings, and co nclusions. Cross-refe rences to Volum e 3 guide the reader to further inform a- tion on several technical, clinical, statistical, and programm atic topics. Conclusions that derive from the dem onstration findings and their relevance to current policy and program - matic considerations are summarized in the final section (these conclusions are discussed in more detail in the final sections of Volum e 1). The third volum e consists of su pporting doc uments covering (1) a chronolog y of research and polic y developm ents that form the backdrop for the results and conclusions of the first two volum es; (2) findings from OASIS reliability studies; (3) an overview of the measurem ent constructs and issue s germ ane to the research; (4) the OASIS data set with an explanatory prologue; (5) an operations m anual for im plem enting and m aintaining OBQI in a home health agency ; (6) illustrative agency-level outcom e, case mix, and adverse event reports; (7) a summary of the operational com ponents of the dem onstration trials; (8) methods used by home health care providers in successfull y enhancing patient outcom es; and (9) a bibliography of relevant literature. Volum e 4 contains points of rationale for why certain steps are prere quisite to or inherent in collecting and processing accurate OASIS data in order to m easure and im prove patient outcom es. An \" OASIS Chronicle\" constitutes the largest portion of Volum e 4. This docum ent provides an item -by-item summary of ke y attributes and recom mendations for every OASIS data item. The attributes provided for each item include its precise wording, the tim e points at which data are recorded, clarify ing o r explanatory info rmation, the rationale for the item , uses for the item that pertain to both agency -speci fic and CMS applications, the developm ental and em pirical testing history for the item , inform ation on validity and reliability , perceived and real constraints or lim itations, other points of infor - mation as appropriate, the overall necessit y of the item , and a recommendation for retention or change. The OASIS Chronicle and its introductory docum entation are intended to form a starting point for the continued evolution an d improvem ent of OASIS a nd its applications. \u00a92002 Center for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO iv PREF ACE The Center for Health Services Resea rch in the Division of Health Care Polic y and Research is a m ultidisciplinary research organi zation established in 1976 at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center.

Design and Setting: A quasi experim ental design with pro spective p re/pos t and study/control com ponents within two multiyear dem onstration trials (occurring from 1995 to 2000) in which 73 home health agenci es im plemented OBQI, receiving several annual cycles of outcom e reports to evaluate and enhance patient outcom es. Partic ipants: 157,548 predom inantly eld erly adm itted over three years to 54 OBQI agencies from 27 states in the National Dem onstration Trial, 105,917 patien ts admitted over f our yea rs to 19 OBQI agencies in the New York State T rial, and 248,621 patien ts adm itted over th ree years to non-OBQI contro l agencies in the 27 dem onstration states. Intervention: As a clinical m anagem ent and adm inistrative intervention, OBQI involves collecting, encoding, and transm itting OASIS patien t-level health s tatus d ata to a central source th at provides each OBQI agency with a risk-adju sted outcom e report com paring the agency's patient outcom es with those fr om a reference population and with its own outcom es from the prior period. Target out comes are selected and focused plans of action im plem ented to change care behaviors. Outcom e changes are evaluated through the next report cycle. Measurements: Outcom e measures include ho spital ization rates and im provem ent and stabilization outcom e rates in functional, physiologic, em otional/behavioral, and cogni - tive he alth. Results: For the National and New York State De monstration T rials, respectively, the risk-adjusted r elative rates of decline in hospitalization of 22% and 26% for OBQI patients over the three-year and four-year dem onstration periods were significant (P<.001) and unparalleled by considerably sm aller rates of dec line for the non-OBQI patients in the 27 states. The risk-adjus ted rates of im provem ent for OBQI target outcom e measures of health s tatus averaged 5% to 7% per year in both dem onstration trials, and were significan tly greater (P<.05) than analogous im provem ent rates for nontarget com parison outcom es, whic h averaged about 1% per year. Conclusions: It is feasible to in tegrate the programm atic, data collection, data transm ent co mponents of OBQI into the day-to-day operations of hom e health agencies. The agg regate findings and the ag ency-level evidence available from site-specific comm unications suggest that OBQI had a pervasive impact on outcom e improve ment for hom e health patients. The OASIS data set provides patien t-level data f or OBQI and is c ritical for m onitoring the outcom es of HHC for both Medicare and non-Medicare patients under a new per-case paym ent system that has incentives to deleteriously withhold services from patients. This data set can and should be carefully and scientifically refined ove r tim e in accord with (1 ) CMS's responsibiliti es to patients, (2) the value of OBQI, (3) paym ent considerations, (4) provider efficiency, (5) Medicare requirem ents for com prehens ive assessm ents, (6) quali m onitoring, and (7) consum er or public repor ting. OBQI warrants expansion and refinem ent in HHC and experim entation in other health care settings. \u00a92002 for Heal th Serv ices Resea rch, UCHSC , Den ver, CO viii 2 RES EARCH AND TECHNI CAL OVERVIEW This volum e is written in journa l-article form at for purposes of clarity and efficiency (it has b een acc epted f or pub lication in th e Journal of the American Geriatrics Society ). Certain topics from the journal vers ion were expanded in writing this docum ent in order to provide additional inform ation or cross-references to other volum es. A. BACKGROUND Hom e health care (HHC) is gene rally reg arded as pref erable to ins titutional c ts and their fam ilies. However, litt le is known about the outcom es of HHC and whether it is possible and practical to m easure, m onitor, and im prove the outcom es of HHC. Our ability to m easure outcom es has b een particularly probl ematic since utiliza - tion of HHC has changed radically over the pas t two decad es. Becaus e Medicare is the dominant payer for skilled HHC services (skilled nursing, physic al and occupational therapies, speech and language pathology, a nd m edical social work ) as well as hom e health aide se rvices that a ccom pany skille d care, its paym ent and regula tory p ractices have im pacted considerably the types and numbers of hom e health agencies, practice patterns, utilization, and expe nditures. By rem oving restrictions on the provision and supply of HHC, the Omnibus Budget Reconc iliation Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-499) encour - aged hom e health utilization and enabled more hospital-based and proprietary hom e health agencies to participat e in Medicare, resulting in an increase from 2924 agencies in 1980 to 5695 agencies in 1990.1, 2 Implem entation of Medicare prospective paym ent for hospitals based on diagnosis-related groups (D RGs) served as a catalyst for hospital patien ts to be disch arged \"qu icker and s thereby incr easing the ca se m ix intens ity of patients adm itted to HHC by the m id-to-late 1980s.3 As a result of a l987 legal chal - lenge, clarification of Medicare cov erage of HHC 1989 spurred g rowth to 10,577 agencies by 1997.4, 5 This growth was accom panied by increases in M edicare HHC visits from 36 million in 1987 to 256 million in 1997, the aver age num ber of visits per patient from 23 in 1987 to 73 in 1997, a nd Medicare hom e health expenditures from $2.6 billion in 1987 to $16.7 billion in 1997.5, 6 In response to these incr eases, Congress enacted a sweeping set of changes in Medicare paym ent for HHC through the Ba lanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33). This legislation imposed lim its and decrease s in paym ent that were im plemented under the Interim Payment Syste m (IPS) for certifi ed HHC providers until a per-case prospec - tive paym ent system (PPS) could be im plem ented, which occurred in October 2000. By 1999, IPS resulted in m ore than a 50% redu ction in to tal visits to 112 m illion, a declin e of over 40% in visits per pati ent to 42, and greater than a 50% decrease in Medicare expenditures on HHC to $7.9 billion.7 Agen cy closu res and withdrawals from Medicare reduced the num ber of agencies by alm ost one-third to 7146 by the end of 2000.8 As these wide swings in the supply, use, and cost of hom e health services were occurring, concerns regarding the lack of ev idence on patient-level he alth effects of such 2002 Center for Healt h Services Researc h, UC HSC, De nver, CO 1 care were heigh tening.9, 10 The federal ag ency that adm inistered Medicare and Medicaid, the Health Care Financing Adm inistration (HCFA), now CMS, did not have objective inform ation to assess the effects of thes e changes on Medicare beneficiaries. Physicians, hospital discharge planners, and case m anage rs lacked ev idence on the effectiv eness of HHC in their comm unities tha t would ass ist in m aking ref erral dec isions. Payers (including Medicare and Medicaid), hom e care clinical m anagers, physicians, other individual clinicians, and adm inistrators at home health agencies were un able to ass ess the effectiveness of HHC for their patients. Most recently, under IPS and the advent of PPS, data on patient outcom es have becom e imperative to evaluate patient well being as paym ent lessened and subsequently was based on per-case reim bursem ent, which can create perverse incentives to underserve patients. Since its inception, the continuous qual ity im provem ent (CQI) m ovement has 11-14shaped quality m anagem ent efforts in the United State s' hea lth c are system . CQI changed our orientation from traditiona l qua rance d irected at satisfying prespeci - fied standards for the structure, processes, and (occasionally) outcom es of health ca re to an orientation that em phasizes continuous en hancem ent of health and health care from year to y ear15-18 and, to a greater extent than before, the im pacts of care on the well being of patients (patient outcom es).19-21 Salient featu res of an effective CQI program include (1) an em phasis on clinically useful and se nsitive indicators of quality that can be measured across tim e periods, (2) ongoing reporting of statistical inform ation on such measures that perm its tim ely com parisons of present with past perform ance, and (3) sufficient clarity and m eaningfulness of findings so that clinicians, m anagers, and payers c an encour age or im plem ent change s in care b ehavio rs to im prove quality o r reinforce exem plary care. Anticipa ting the need f or ou tcom es-rela ted information that m ight enhance CQI, HCFA, in conjunction with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and later the New York State Departm ent of Health, em barked on a research and developm ent program in the late 1980s to assess the feasibility and utility of m easuring the outcom es of HHC. This 15-year program evolved through severa l overlapping stages of research, develop - ment, pilot testing, clinical and m ethodologi cal review, dem onstration, and evaluation activ ities. A summ ary of the m ore salient research, policy cha nges, and health care issues that shaped the evolu tion of this program is contai ned in Volum e 1 and Supporting Docum ent 1 of Volum e 3. The findings repor ted h ere pertain to the recen tly com outcom e-based quality im provem ent (OBQI) de monstration and evaluation stage of this prog ram, accom panied by m ethodologi cal highlights from earlier stages. B. METHODS 1. Outcome Measures and Data Items In keeping with Donabedian, a patien t health status ou tcom e is defined as a ch ange in health status between two (o r more) tim e points,22 typically adm ission and discharge for hom e health patients. Health status is broadly define d to include functional, physio - logic, cognitive, and em otional/behavioral dim ensions of health. An initial set of over 500 patient health-status outcom es was speci fied after review ing the outcom e and 2002 Center for Healt h Services Researc h, UC HSC, De nver, CO 2 long-term care literature, conducting unstructu red discussions on appropriate and useful patient outcom es with clinicians from all di sciplines involved in HHC as well as repre - sentatives of regulatory and governm ental program s, and then surveying hom e health providers on outcom es. The draft set of outcom es was refined through several rounds of external review by approxim ately 20 resear chers in the long-term care field and 20 nationally recognized clinical experts f rom all disc iplines invo lved in HHC. The reviews were design ed to ev aluate each outco me in term s of clinica l validity and u tility, importance to patient health, and expect ed m easurem ent precision. Data item s to measure the resu lting outcom es were then de veloped using extant data sets, refining existing data item s as needed, and developi ng new item s when others were nonexistent or inadequa te. Data item s and outcom e measures were iteratively refined and reduced through field testing at over 200 home health agencies nationally during a pe riod of several years in which (1) outcom e measures continued to be evaluated and revised clinically and empirically, (2) new data item s were added to risk ad just ou tcom e measures for case m ix differences am ong patient groups being com pared, (3) alternative outcom e measure ment approache s were exam ined f or their pr actic ality and utility in m onitoring and m anaging impacts of care on patient well being, and (4) a CQI applications fram ework that would eventually be term ed OBQI was develope d and pilot tested in several hom e care agencies.23 The final data set for m easuring and risk adjus ting ou tcom es was term ed the Outcom e and Assess ment Infor mation Set (OASIS) for hom e health care.24, 25 This 107- item data set was d esigned to be in tegrated into a hom e health agency 's start-of-care (SOC) and f ollow-up patient as sessm ent f orms, replacing like item s with OASIS item s. Despite the fact that the m ore precis ely wo rded OASIS data items required m ore space in assessm ent form s, agencies already perform ing a clinically appropriate com prehensive assessm ent of each patient add ed little, if any, new con tent to their SOC assessm ent form when they rep laced extant item s with OASIS items. A subsequent (double-blind) tim e survey showed once clin ical staff becam e fam iliar with OASIS item s, average tim e required for patient assessm ents re turned to that required before OASIS was used -- for clinicians that had previously been condu cting com prehensive assessm ents as required under Medicare. The tim e study is discussed in more detail in Supporting Docum ent 2 of Volum e 3. Consisten t with Med icare ce rtification requirements, OASIS item s were com pleted at SOC for each adult (18 years or o lder), nonm aternity patient. OASIS data were collected approxim ately every 60 days until and including tim e of discharge. A 60-day interval, which resu lted f rom testing da ta collection in terva ls of varying lengths, was optim al for the com bined objectives of provi der efficien cy and clinical and statis tical utility of outcom e measurem ent. This length of tim e allowed the data item s to be used effectively for ass essing p atient hom e care needs, m easuring outcom es as changes in health status between SOC and follow-up point s, and risk adjusting outcom e measures to take into consideration case m ix differen ces between an agen cy's pa tients and its comparison group. For the sake of parsim ony and clinical utility, the 41 dichotom ous outcom e measures enum erated in Table 1 we re (and still are) used for OBQI. Every OASIS data item other than p atient identif iers is used eith er to measure or ris k adjus t at least one, but typically m any, of the 41 outcom es. The m ajority of these are functional 2002 Center for Healt h Services Researc h, UC HSC, De nver, CO 3 TABLE 1: Outcome Me asur es Used in OBQI Demon strations.

A patient stabilizes when the scale value for the health at tribute un der consideration shows nonw orsening in pa tient condition. If the patient is no more di sabled or depend ent (th at is, has not worsened ) at discharge th an at start of care, then the patient h as stabilized and the stabilizat ion outcome measure takes on the value \"1,\" w hereas if the p atient worsened, th e stabilization measure takes on the value \"0.\" If the patient is not able to worsen according to the scale (i.e., is at the most dependen t or \"sickest\" extreme of t he sca le), then the m easure is not computed for this particular patient because his/her conditi on cannot worsen. Exclusions result in differing sample sizes for each health status outcome. As an illustr ation, the ambulation/locomotion scale in O ASIS is specified as fol lows: Ability to SAFELY walk, once in a standing position, or use a wheelchair, once in a seated position, on a variet y of surfaces. 0 -Able to independentl y walk on even and u neven surfaces and climb stairs w ith or without railings (i.e., needs no human assistance or assistive device). 1 -Requires use of a device (e.g., cane , walker) to walk alone or requires huma n supervision or assistance to negotiate stairs or steps or un even surfaces. 2 -Able to walk only with the supe rvision or assistance of another person at all times. 3 -Chairfast, unable to am bulate but is able to wheel self independentl y. 4 -Chairfast, unable to am bulate and is unable to wheel self. 5 -Bedfast, unable to ambulate or be u p in a chair. If the patient is classif ied at level \"0\" at start of ca re, the improvement m easure fo r ambulation/locomotion is not computed. If the patient is class ified at leve l \"5,\" the stabilization measur e is not computed. Utilization outcomes take on the value \" 1\" if the indicated event occur s; otherw ise, they take on the value \" 0.\" Unlike the aforementione d improvement a nd stabilization outcomes, thes e outcomes are defined fo r all patients. For e xample, if the patient is hospitalized (as an inpati ent, for a pe riod of at least 48 hours), the hospitalization measure takes on the value \"1;\" othe rwise, it takes on the value \"0.\" 2002 Center for Healt h Services Researc h, UC HSC, De nver, CO 4 outcom es because of the em phasis in hom e care on ass isting patien ts to becom e or rem ain sufficiently independent to stay in their home environm ent, avoiding institutional long- term or acute care. The m ore techn ical or specific sk illed se rvices provided by hom e health agency staff such as wound care, ad ministering IVs, infection control, cardiac evaluation and m onitoring, and cognitive assessm ent often are directed toward or culm i- nate in assisting patients to (resum e) function(ing) as well as possible at hom e. Each health status ou tcom e measure is eithe r an im provem ent or stabiliza tion measure as defined in the first footnote of Table 1. At times, the intent of HHC is to prevent d ecline or s low the ra te of decline in hea lth s tatus. Hence, in addition to improve ment m easures, Table 1 contains select ed stabilization m easures that are often necessary to ev aluate outcom es. The research consid erations and p th at shap ed the appro aches to outcom e measurem ent in this program are discussed in the article reproduced in Supporting Docum ent 3 (Volum e 3). While it is possible to em ploy aggreg ate outcom e measures corresponding to multiple dom ains of health (such as a s ingle g lobal m easure en compassing all dom ains of functioning sim ultaneously) and thereby to m easure outcom es on near-continuous or at least polytom ous (ordinal) scales, dichotom ous outcom es corresponding to individual domains of health status were chosen for OB QI applications for two reasons. First, they are m ore readily understood by clinicians (and others). Second, they are m ore straight- forward to use to enhance patient outco mes than mo re complex composite outcome measures that nec essitate determ ining which specific outcom e dom ains m ust be further exam ined to im prove the com posite m easure. The utilization outcom es in Table 1 can be regard ed as su rrogate health s tatus outcom es. While the 41 outcom e measures in th is table h ave been s elected for OBQI applicati ons at the p resent tim e, research to im prove upon these outcom es for OBQI and other applications is ongoing. Inform ation on reliability of OASIS data item s is available in Supporting Docu - ment 2 (Volume 3) and elsewhere.13, 26 An outcom e measure was judged to be reliable for OBQI if the underlying data item used to com pute the outcom e had an interrater relia - bility coefficien t (weigh ted kapp a) greater th an 0.60. (The rate rs in cluded two skilled nurses trained in using OASIS who did duplicate assessm ents within 24 hours of one another, while random izing which rater was fi rst, for 66 patients from five agencies.) Only two of the 38 health status outcom e measures used in th e OBQI outcom e reports had coefficients less than 0.60 (both were 0.54). Twenty-five ou tcom e measures had reliability coefficien ts greater than 0.70. OASIS reliab ility testing ents to improve reliab ility will con tinue a s CMS and others use OASIS and OBQI nationally. The current version of OASIS, with an explanatory prologue and instructions for using OASIS, is provided in Supporting Docum ent 4 (Volum e 3). 2. The Framew ork for Quality Improvement The essential features of the CQI appl ications fram ework e mployed in the OBQI demonstration trials were developed and refi ned in a pilot projec t involving several hom e health agencies in the ea rly 1990s. Supporting Docum ent 5 (Volum e 3) contains a detailed explanation of OBQI. This fr amework includes the outcom e analysis and 2002 Center for Healt h Services Researc h, UC HSC, De nver, CO 5 outcom e enhancem ent components depicted in Figure 1. The outcom e analysis com po- nent begin s with co llecting, com puterizi ng, and transm itting OASIS data to a central source (the University of Colorado in the case of the dem onstrations). Outcom e, case mix, and adverse event reports are returned to each agency on an annual basis. Most important is th e All Pa tients' Outc ome Report that perm its agency staff to analyze their patien t outcom es aggregated to the agency level. In the d emonstr ations, two additional outcom e reports for orthopedic and cardiac pa tients were provided if agency-specif ic sample sizes were ad equate. The outcom e reports prov ide a com parison of agency perform ance (1) relative to a national re ference or benchm ark population and (2) from one year to the next. The 41 outcom e measur es presen ted in Table 1 were selected from a larg er set of outcom es for the all-patient re ports. The case m ix report contains an over- view of the agency's adm itting case m ix on about 140 case m ix factors for the current time period or ye ar relative to the agency 's prior tim e period and the (national) reference group. The adverse event report provides a profile on low-frequency adverse patient outcom es such as em ergent care for hypo/hyperg lycem ia. Incidence ra tes for such events are too low for m eaningful risk adjustm ent. Their occu rrenc e gene rally require s rev iew and scrutiny on a c ase-by-ca se basis. Figur e 2 provides a n illu stration f rom an outcom e report; the footnotes explain the term s and computations involved. A com plete copy of the outcom e report series for a hypothetical agency is found in Supporting Docum ent 6, Volum e 3. It contains sam ple outcom e, case mix, and adverse event reports as well as a patient satisfaction report included as part of the dem onstrations. FIGURE 1: OBQI Applications Frame work.

These include p rocess-of-care inv estigations th culminate in th e developm ent and im plem en- tation of plans of action specifying how car e behaviors will be changed to enhance outcom es. Upon conclusion of the first dem onstration year, each dem onstration agency received an outcom e report showing its perf ormance during that year relative to all demonstration agencies (no pr ior period com parison was possible the first year). After reviewing the report, various m ethods were implem ented by agency staff to assess and change specif ic care behaviors related to target outcom es of their choosing. Thus, agencies produced written plans of action for th eir target outcom es at the beginning of the second demonstration year. These plans docum ented the target outcom e, care behaviors being targeted, how and where they would be changed, who would be responsible for implementing the changes, and how the ch anges would be m onitored on a continuing basis. The ou tcom e enhancem ent process wa s repeated at the start of each succeeding demonstration year when the annu al ou tcom e report was received. Accurate and uniform data on patient health status ar e critically im portant to OBQI. In addition, accuracy and unifo rmity of patient inform ation introduce far m ore rigor into the assessm ent process than had been custom ary in HHC. Further, the OBQI approach entails a considerably different type of thinking and philosophy than typically used by home care prov iders. Such th inking requ ires ana lysis that link s care to spe cific ou tcom es in m anaging care behaviors and coordinating changes in care behaviors that involve multiple p roviders. Separate train ing program s accom panied the dem onstration tria ls that focused on incorporating OASIS into com prehensive assessm ents and using OBQI to evaluate and enhance patient outcom es. 3. Demonstration and Evaluation Design After the developm ental research, includ ing a p ilot to ass ess th e feasib ility of OBQI, two large-scale dem onstration trials were designed and im plem ented. Hospital - ization was selected as the m ost pivotal ou tcom e to evaluate s ince it would be readily measurable for non-OBQI patients as well as on a pre/post basis for OBQI patients. The other outcom es in Table 1 were selected fo r the pre/post com parisons for OBQI patients. Mortality was not selected as an OBQI outcom e because, for the predom inantly elderly population, it is exceptionally difficult to de fine and risk adjust (low frequency) unexpected m ortality. Dem onstration agenci es were selected from a larger pool of several hundred agencies that expressed intere st in OBQI. Dem onstration sites included small, m edium , and large agencies, both ru ral and urban, and agencies representing a variety of ownership types. It was not possible to random ize the OBQI intervention because (1) OASIS is an in tegral part of th e OBQI interven tion and yet (2 ) it als o would be needed to provide the data to risk adjus t and m easure outcom es in the non -OBQI group (since sufficiently precise health status data were not unif ormly available from clinical recor ds of hom e health agencie s at the tim e the dem onstration tr ials we re im ple- mented). That is, without collecting OASIS data, it would be im possible to com pare outcom es in the interventi on (OBQI) and nonintervention (non-OBQI) groups. Para- doxically, by collecting such data the nonin tervention group would receive a significant portion of the intervention -- nam ely, a sta ndardized approach to assessm ent, data 2002 Center for Healt h Services Researc h, UC HSC, De nver, CO 8 collection, com puterization, veri fication of the accur acy of health status inform ation, and associated training of clinical s taff. Unto itself, th is standard ized app roach could influ - ence outcom es by heightening th e awaren ess a nd possibly the m otivation of providers to be m ore attentive to patient needs. Alternatively, if nona gency staff were to collect OASIS data at SOC and follow-up points, th e nonintervention pati ents would receive different professional/clinica l attention a t these poin ts than the inte rvention pa tients. As a result, three comparative approaches not involving random ization were incor - porated into the research design. First, a pre/post com parison of risk-adjusted outcom es would be undertaken from one de monstration ye ar to the next for patients pooled across all dem onstration agencies. Second, for the m ost im portant outcom e, hospitalization, a random ly selected com parison group of non-OB QI Medicare patients from the sam e states as the OBQI Medicare patients would be used to as sess wheth er changes in hosp i- talization rates for Medicare patients (who com prise the m ajority of HHC patients) under OBQI were different from those for non-OBQI HHC patients in the sam e states. Third, since the OBQI m ethodology involves selecting specific target or OBQI outcom es, a comparison of i mprove ments or changes in such outcom es with im prove ments or changes in (uncorrelated) nontarget outco mes would be undertake n. Statistical power would be exceptionally high (e xceeding .95 ), even for sm all effects, sin ce the d esign called for larg e sam ple sizes. In acco rd with th is dem onstration desi gn and evaluation plan, HCFA sponsored a national OBQI dem onstration trial be tween 1995 and 2000, with funding from both HCFA and the Robert W ood Johnson Foundation. This national dem onstration involved 54 hom e health agencies from 27 states. If successful, the dem onstration approach would serve as the prototype for a national OBQI program for all Medicare-certif ied hom e health agencies. The national OBQI tria l was designed to establish a m ethodology and template to (1) collect uniform (OASIS) data on all adult, nonm aternity hom e health patients to m easure and report patient outcom es, (2) utilize ou tcom e measures for CQI in HHC, and (3) provide a foundation for an approach to enhancing patient outcom es, which might lead to a m ore efficient sys temwide approach to perform ance im provement in HHC. In late 1995, the New York State Departm ent of Health im plemented a statewide OBQI de monstration trial, patterned afte r HCFA's national OBQI dem onstration, that began with 19 and would eventually involve 33 certified agencies and 24 noncertif ied agencies. Like the National Dem onstration, this six-year program was adm inistered by the Univers ity of Colorado Cen ter for Hea lth Services Research. After training by Research Center staff, the m ore than 100 agen cies participating in the two demonstration trials integ rated into their day -to-day operation all facets of OASIS and outcom e data collection, m onitoring, processing, transm ission, and OBQI. Further specifics on the operational com ponents of both de monstrations are presented in Supporting Docum ent 7, Volum e 3. 2002 Center for Healt h Services Researc h, UC HSC, De nver, CO 9 4. Target Outco mes in the Demonstration To evaluate effectiven ess of OBQI and to encourage agency s taff to efficiently channel quality im provem ent energies, all cert ified agen cies partic ipating in each dem were asked to focus their outco me enhancem ent activities exclusiv ely on two target outcom es (although som e agencies ch ose m ore than two). Hospitalization was a strongly recomm ended target outcom e during the first round of OBQI for four reasons. First, it is im portant substan tively becau se if a patien t's cond changes or declin es to a point where inpatient hospital car e is nec essary, it is like ly that a serious change in health status has occurred. Second, if providers coul d improve (i.e., lower) hospitalization rates, it would strongly suggest OBQI could be effective, be cause hospitalization is a challenging outcom e to im pact in view of the multiplic ity of factors tha t influenc e it, the frequent need for various clinical staff of the hom e care agency to b e invo lved, and th e need to have physician input and involvem ent in the process. Thus, hospitalization often cannot be im pacted without involving and in fluencing the care be haviors of several providers. Third, in keeping with the rese arch design, having all agencies attem pt to improve a single outcom e (which encom passes a num ber of potential health status changes) would facilitate hom ogeneous pre/post and intervention/nonintervention comparisons of the effectiveness of OBQI . Fourth, reducing hospitalization rates can have substantial im pacts on (lowering) the total cos t of care while at th e sam e time reflecting enhanced patient outcom es and, thus , cost-effectiveness. For the second target outcom e, however, agencies were free to choose from approxim ately 80 different outcom es contained in either their standard 41-outcom e, all-patie nt report or, where applicable, two special outcom e reports for orthopedic and cardiac patients, respectively. Agencies typ ically cho se outcom es reflecting inferior perform ance on their part relative to the na tiona l reference s ample. 5. Risk Adjustment of Outcomes To com pare outcom es for patients from one demonstration agency with outcom es for patien ts from all dem onstration agen cies, each ou tcom e measure was risk ad justed using logistic regression (a fter testing several risk adjustm ent m ethods including multivariate standard ization, discrim inant f unction analysis, puterized ification the Classification and Regr ession Tree [CART] m ethodology, the Group Method of Data Handling [GMDH], and m ultileve l stratification). The ris k adjus tment methodology described here represents the st arting point for furthe r research that is presently taking place to extend and rev ise th e risk ad justm ent techn iques that will be used to produce outcom e reports for all cer tified hom e health agencies in the United States. To estim ate and then v alidate each logis tic regression m odel, the en tire pool of patien ts for a giv en tim e period was random ly split into two equal g roups, a developm ental and a validation sam ple. For exam ple, for the first dem onstration year, the total num ber of outcom e episodes was approxim ately 40,000, resulting in develop- mental and validation sam ples of approxim ately s \"episode, \" t,\" and \"case\" are us ed in terch angeab ly hereafter.] Each of the 41 logistic regression m odels was estim ated using cases exclusively from the develop- mental sam ple. This first entailed concep tually and c linically spe cifying a ll risk factors that m ight influence the outco me under consideration from the 150 to 2002 Center for Healt h Services Researc h, UC HSC, De nver, CO 10 160 possible risk factors. Empirical testi ng using bivariate m easures of association (Pearson correlations) and stepwise logistic regression foll owed in order to address the relationships between candidate risk factors and the outcom e measure under consideration. This process included exam ining som e highe r order and inte raction term s that did not usually contribute m ore than thei r firs t-orde r coun rative s teps f ollowed in which th e initial ve rsion of the logistic regression model was estim ated for the ou tcom e, and th e coefficien ts and odds ratios for each risk factor were ex amined to determ ine if they wer e clinic ally p lausible and statis tically reasonab le. Risk facto rs with questionable or insignificant coefficients were elim inated, at tim es substituting ano ther risk f actor or a com bination of risk f actors. Statistical significance was established at P<.10 instead of P<.05 for individual coefficients since a predic tive m odel ra ther than an impact assessm ent (i.e., to ass ess th e impact of specific risk factors) was being developed. Each m odel was re-estim ated a num ber of tim es to reach a cred ible and stab le m odel. Upon co mpletion of this first-stage process, th e explanatory power of the m odel was tested using the independent validation sam ple. This involv ed selecting 20 random subsam ples (each 25% of the total) from the validation sam ple and correlating the pred icted outcom e values with the observed outcom e values for each subs ample to obtain twenty \"R2\" statisti cs, one for each of the 20 random validation sam ples. This intuitive R2 statistic is the squ ared Pea rson correlation between predicted and observed values.27 It proved to be the m ost useful statistic in asses sing exp lanatory power of logistic regr ession m samples relative to developm ental sam ples for this application. Thus, each R2 reflects the proportion of outcom e variance explained by the m odel in the validation subsam ple. A substantial discrepancy betw een the (s imilarly com puted) R2 for the develop- mental sam ple and the m ean R2 for the validation subsam ples, or an unusually large range for the 20 R2s, indic ated tha t the m odel lik ely had been overfit to the develop- mental sam ple. That is, the m odel had been es timated in such a way that its risk f actor s and coefficients were excessiv ely tailored to the unique r ather than the repres entative charac teristics was identif ied, re-estim ation of the m odel was then undertaken using th e developm ental sam ple. The above steps would be repea ch anging or elim inating the (som etimes multicollin ear o r high ly correlated) risk facto rs judg ed to cause th e problem , re-estim ating m odel reviewing the m odel again, unti l a stable an d clinica lly v alid m odel was obtained for which the developm ental sam ple explanatory power and validation explana - tory power were approxim ately the sam e. For exam ple, in estim ating the in itial risk model f or hospita lization u sing th e deve lopm ental sam it was poss ible to attain a developm ental R2 close to .40 by overfitting the m odel owing to the large num ber of risk factors available through OASIS . However, validation R2s for this ou tcom e were usually under .20, which required re-estim ation until the developm ental and validation R2s converged between .15 and .19. The 41 separa te risk m odels for each outcom e were derived in this m anner and used to produce outcom e reports f or th e first y ear of the demonstration prog rams that perm itted a com parison of observed and exp ected ra tes for all ou tcom es for every agency. Risk m odels were re-estim ated each y ear in producing several rounds of outcom e reports for each hom e health agency part icipating in the OBQI demonstrations. Tables 2 and 3 provide illu strations of two risk m odels estim ated for recen t outcom e report purposes. 2002 Center for Healt h Services Researc h, UC HSC, De nver, CO 11 TABLE 2: Logistic Regre ssion Model for Ris k Adjus ting th e Outcome of Improv ement in Dres sing Low er Body .

Evaluation Approach for Hospitaliz ation Outcomes Evaluation of the dem onstrations was c once rned pr imarily with the im pacts of OBQI on patient outcom es and secondarily w ith the feasibility of im plem enting the OBQI approach. If outcom es were im pacted as a result of the firs t or succeeding y ears' outcom e reports and outcom e enhancem ent activ ities, this would s uggest that the OBQI framework was f easible to im plem ent and would produce the desired results. The outcom e reports prov ide a straightforward way to evaluate the im pacts of each indiv idual agency's OBQI program by com paring target outcom e rates f or the cur rent p eriod with the risk-adjusted rates for the prior period. To evaluate the general OBQI im pact on hospita lization rates (the first targe t outcom e) for all patients, the sam e approach can be used by pooling data across all OBQI patients, com paring the cu rrent period's hospital - ization rate with the risk-adjusted rate for the prior period. An alternative, which yields essentially the sam e results, is to inc lude al l risk factors relevant f or the hospitalization outcom e in a single logistic regression m odel estim ated on the pooled sam ple of all current and prior period patients in the dem onstration, with a dichotom ous variable corresponding to the prior vs. the current period. The m agnitude and significance of the coefficient or odd s ratio for th is va riable reflect the m agnitude and significance of the risk-adjusted m ean difference in hospitalizati on rate s for the two period s (yea rs). Since this app roach is m ore commonly used in ev aluations of this na ture, it was em ployed to determ ine pre/post results for adjacen t dem onstration y ears and between the firs t and final dem onstration years for each of the two dem onstration trials. To assess intervention (OBQI) vs. nonint ervention (non-OBQI) group differences, Medicare claim s data were us ed to determ ine hospitalizati on rates for a random sample of non-OBQI Medicare patients in th e dem onstra tion s tates. This perm itted a com parison of changes in ho spitalization ra tes over the dem onstration time period between OBQI and non-OBQI Medicare hom e health patients. It was not possible to risk adjust the non- OBQI hospitalization rates for Medicare hom e health patients, because OASIS data were not available for thes e patients and the h ealth status d ata av ailable from claim s was not sufficiently com prehensive and consistent. Nonintervention patients were restricted to the dem onstration states, and annual change s in unadjusted hospitalization rates were compared for interven tion and noninterv ention pa tients in these states using the unequal variance t-test and W ilcoxon test, both of which yielded the sam e results. As is evident in the findings section (Section D), using unadjusted rates for this com parison proved inform ative in view of the very close para llels between annual tre nds in adjusted and unadjusted hospitalization rates for patien ts on whom OASIS data were available. 7. Evaluation Approach for Other Outcomes Analysis of changes for the target out comes other than hospitalization from one year to the nex t was com plicated by the fact that no sing le target outcom e was chosen by a preponderance of agencies. Consequently, findings were com bined across different outcom es and standardized for the differen ces in m agnitudes of m ean outcome rates across the different outcom e measures. This was done by analyzi ng the risk-adjusted percen t change or improvem ent in each agency 's nonhospitalization targ et outcom e rates from one year to the n ext, av eraging the percent chang es across all ag encies first to 2002 Center for Healt h Services Researc h, UC HSC, De nver, CO 14 determ ine whether the average im provem ent rate exceeded zero for su ch target ou tcom es. This average im provem ent rate (i.e., per cent change) for targ et outcom es also was compared with the average im provem ent ra te for a se t of uncorre lated com parison outcom es, because it was approp riate to c ontro l for possib le con current ou tcom e trends resulting from factors other than the structured OBQI m ethodology. For this purpose it was necessary to use (relatively) uncor related com parison outcom es because it is plausible for a plan of action focused on one target outcom e to influence other nontarget outcom le) fects. For ex ample, by positiv ely influencing the target outcom e of I mprove ment in Am bulation/Locom otion, it is also possible for an agency to positively influe nce the ou tcom e of Im prove ment in Trans - ferring (e.g., bed-to-chair, stan ding-to-sitting) because th ese two outcom es are highly correlated. Therefore, within each dem onstration agency, a com parison outcom e was selected for each (nonhosp italization) target outcom e so that it was at m ost m inimally associated or correlated (either po sitively or nega tively) the ta rget ou tcom e. This perm itted the m ean percen t change (im prove ment rate) a cross all national (or New York State) dem onstration agencies for nonhospita lization target outcom es to be com pared with an analogous m ean percent change for comparison outcom es that were uncorrelated with the target outcom es at each agency. Subject to the requ irement that im provem ent measures be com pared with im provement measures and s tabilization m easures b e compared with stabilizatio n m easures (def ined in the first footnote of Table 1), comparison outcom es were selected solely on th e bas is of low correlation with the targ et outcom e (prior to exam ining actual chang e rates at the agency level). The (risk -adjusted ) mean percent change for th e target outco me sam ple was com pared with the (r isk- adjusted) m ean percent change for th e com parison outcom e sam ple using the two-sam ple unequal variance t-test and was verifi ed with the two-sam ple W ilcoxon test. C. RESULTS 1. Hospita lization Outcome F indings The tim e periods for each cycle of out come reporting were approx imately 12 m onths and were term ed Years 1, 2, 3, and (for the New York State D emonstration ) 4. OBQI i mpacts on outcom es were assessed (1) by com paring the outcom e changes between pairs of consecutive years for a ll dem onstration agency patients and (2) by comparing year-to-year hospitalization rate changes for OBQI patients with non-OBQI patients in the dem onstration states. The re sults com paring risk-a djusted hospitalization rates for Year 1 vs. Year 2 and Year 2 vs. Year 3 for the National and New York State Demonstrations are presented in Figure 3, along with the Year 3 vs. Year 4 com parison for New York State. For the National OBQI Demonstration, after adjusting for the risk factor differences, the Year 1 hospitalization rate was 33.0%, com pared with the Year 2 hospitalization rate of 29.3%. The decrease of 3.7 percenta ge points is statistically significant (P<.001) and translates into a relative rate of dec line from Year 1 to Year 2 of 11%. The analogous risk-adjusted decrease fr om Year 2 to Year 3 was from 29.5% to 25.3% (the first footnote in F igure 3 explains why this Year 2 rate is slightly different from the first Year 2 rate which was co mpared with Year 1).

For the New York State findings, this explanati on also pertains to the t wo different Year 3 rates. Subject to the follo wing cond itions reg arding pa irs of years, all 54 certified agencies in the Nati onal Demo nstration contributed to the n ational fin dings. The 19 certified agen cies that started at the outs et of the Ne w York State D emonstrati on co ntributed to the Ne w York State find ings.

For examp le, a fe w agencies started late i n the Nati onal Dem onstratio n and prov ided only Year 2 and Year 3 dat a. Therefore, their pati ent-lev el data were not inc luded in the Year 1 vs. Ye ar 2 comparis on, but the y were included in the Year 2 vs. Year 3 compariso n. All net decr ease s are statistical ly significant (P<.001). The signific ance leve l for each net decre ase corresp onds to a test of the h ypothesis that the net risk-adj usted decr ease i n hospitalization rates was zero.

The risk-adjusted net decrease (not shown in Figure 3) of 7.2 percentage points (from 32.5% to 25.3%) in hosp italization rates from Year 1 to Year 3 for the National OBQI De monstration re sulted in an ov erall risk- adjusted relative rate of decline of 22% over the three-year dem onstration period (P<.001). Analogous annual decreases in risk-adjuste d hospitalization rate s occurred for the New York State OBQI De monstr ation patients as shown in the lower portion of Figure 3. All decreases b etween pairs of adjacen t years were significan t (P<.001), although the decrease from Year 3 to Year 4 was less than the prior two decreases. Also not shown in Figure 3, the overall risk-adjusted relativ e rate of decline from Year 1 to Year 3 was 2 0% (P<.001) and the Year 1 to Year 4 risk-a djusted change in New York (from 30.1% to 22.2%) produced a net decrease of 7.9 percentage points and a four-year over all relative rate of decline of 26% (P<.001). The hospitalization rate changes for non-OBQI Medicare HHC patients in the dem onstrati on states were based on a 5% random sample of Medicare p atients adm itted to nondem onstrati on agen cies states. sizes were 91,679, 81,631, and 75,581 for these non-OBQI patients for Years 1, 2, and 3, respectively, of the National Dem onstration Trial. The findings showed only sm all changes in ho spitalization rates for non -OBQI patients in the dem onstration states between Year 1 and Year 2 of the dem onstration period (a decrease of 0.4%). The change between Year 2 and Year 3 (a decrease of 0.3%) also was sm all com pared to the substantially larger hospitalization decreases attained in the dem onstra tions. Since th e 5% claim s file for Medicare HHC patients di d not perm it a representative sam ple from non-OBQI agencies in New York State, cl aims analyses were not undertaken for non- OBQI patients in New York State. 2. Other Target Outco me Findings The results for target outcom es other than acute hosp italization f or all patients are presented in Figu re 4. The m ean percen t improvem ent (i.e., percent change) in outcom e rates across all national dem onstration agencies in nonhospital ization risk-adjusted t arget outcom es from Year 1 to Y ear 2 was 7.7%. The analo gous m ean percent im prove ment for com parison outcom es was 1.4% over this period. The percent im prove ment in nonhospitalization target outcom es from Year 2 to Year 3 wa s 5.8%, com pared with a 1.1% im prove ment rate in com parison outco mes over the sam e period for the national demonstration agencies. Thus, paralleling th e findings for the patie nt-level ho spitaliza - tion analyses, the ag ency-level analy ses of target outcom e improve ment rates over these two success ive periods of ad jacent y ears resu lted in sign ifican t outcom e enhancem ents (P<.05) for both tim e periods. The New Yo rk State results presented in F igure 4 demonstrate analogous significant changes (P <.05) in nonhospitalization target outcom es relative to chang es in com parison ou tcom es ove r the success ive periods of adjacent y ears. For hospita lization as well as other target outcom es, findings for a m inority of the agencies were not significant ly favorable. Approxim ately 70% to 90% of the agencies favorably and s ignifican tly im pacted their targ et outcom es from one year to the next, although the individual agencies influencing either hospi talization or other target outcom es were not always the sam e across years. 2002 Center for Healt h Services Researc h, UC HSC, De nver, CO 17 /i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0 FIGURE 4: Combined OBQI Impacts on Ri sk-Adjusted Ta Outcomes provement in Risk-Adjusted Outc omes Year 1 to Y ear 2 Year 2 to Y ear 3 8 6 Percent 4Improved 2 0 +7.7% +1.4% oveme nt in Risk-Adjusted O utcom es Year 1 to Year 2 Year 2 to Year 3 Year 3 to Year 4 8 6 Percent Improved 4 2 0 Target Comp arison Target Comp arison Target Comp arison Outcomes Outcomes ind icated in the first footnote in T able 1, due to ex clusions result ing from the def initions of improveme nt and stabilization measures, patient-leve l samp le siz es vary b y measure for all health status outcomes at each agency . In general, a sample size for a target outcome measure might ty pically range from a minimum of 30 or 40 patients to a max imum of 1000 patients or more, depend ing on agency size and case mix . Therefore, patient- level sample size s vary for both target outcome m easures and comparis on outcome meas ures at each agency . In all, for an y given pair of years contributing to the per cent improvement analy ses summarized in this figure, the total patient sample sizes ran ge betw een 20,000 and 50, 000 patients. As indica ted below , however, the comparative ana lyses that resulted in these findin gs used the home he alth agen cy as the unit of anal ysis (actually an outcome measure for a home health agency was the unit of analy sis, since some agencies chose more than one target outcome in addit ion to hospita lization). For the Nation al Demonstratio n analy ses, this resulted in ap proximately 60 cases for each of the two year-to-year c omparisons. For the New Y ork State Demon stration find ings, it resulted in approx imately 40 cases for each of the three year-to-y ear comparisons. The mean cha nge (percent impro vement) for the target outcome sample w as compared with the mean change for the comparison outcome samp le us ing the tw o-samp le unequa l varian ce t-test and the (nonparametric) tw o- sample W ilcoxon test. Results generally agreed regardless of which ty pe of test was used. All mean d ifferences (for pairs of years) were significant (P<.05) des pite the fact that a fairly conservative appro ach w as taken to statistical testing since outcome meas ures at the agency level w ere employ ed as the unit of anal ysis, rather than patients. In this regard, the most important sta tistical test used w as the two-sample unequ al var iance t-test since it permitted the agency -or measure-level an alyses to be weighted b y patient sample sizes corresp onding to the target and comparison o utcomes for each agency . Compar ison outcom es were chosen for each target outcome such that an improvement target outcome would be compared with an improvement compar ison outcome, a stabilization target outcome w ould be compared w ith a stabilization compar ison outcome, and the corre lation s betw een target and comparison outcomes w ere alw ays less than 0.2 (ty pically far less) so that the variance ex plaine d in one outcome by the other would alw ays be less than (0.2)2 or 4%.

DISCUSSION 1. Support for OBQI and Its Value to Patients and Providers Communications with clinical and adm inistrative staff from OBQI agencies contin - ued throughout the dem onstration trials. In addition to providing assistance in clarifying issues and reso lving technical p roblem s, Re search Center s taff receiv ed consid erable feedback about OBQI. The responses to OBQI were nearly always positive, particularly in the later years of the dem onstration tria ls, after OASIS had b een thoroughly integrated into assessm ent and clinical record keeping, computerization and data transm ission issues had been addressed, and agencies receive d the first round of risk -adjusted outcom e reports. By the end of the dem onstration tr ials, m any agency staff had com mented on the value of being able to rigorously and e fficiently m onitor patient outcom es, use the various reports to isolate and resolve problem s for individuals and groups of patients, and continually enhance outcom es. Clinicians a nd adm inistrators also valued the opportunity to access repo rts on p atient case m ix and care needs for staffing and clin ical m anagem ent use, and to as sess co st-effectiveness by com paring outcom es with utilization. In general, (1) the m agnitude of the e ffects of OBQI, (2) the large num bers and variety of patients and providers involved wh ich ensured breadth of experience and statis - tical power, (3) the consistenc y of the pre/post and study/c ontrol findings for hospitaliza - tion rates, (4) the agreem ent between the hospitalization and health status outcom e results, (5 ) the p arallel findings f or th e two se parate dem onstration trials, (6) the contin - ual successes of outcom e enhancem ent for th e vast m ajority of agencies throughout the demonstration, and (7) the inform ation conveyed by clinical staff about the value of OBQI -- com bine to indica te a pervasiv ely favorable impact of OBQI on patient outcom es. The m agnitude of the im prove ments in hospitalization rates and other outcom es was substantial, particularly sin ce hom e health clinicia ns had never undertaken this type of quality im provem ent. Further, as noted in the introduc tion, the latter stages of these dem onstrations were conducte d during a tim e of unprecedented and radical declin e in paym ent (under IPS) accom panied by large reductions in visits per patien t and serious threats to agency s urvival. Owing to prelim inary findings from the OBQI demonstrations, and the value of OASIS data for case m ix adjusting pa yment rates under PPS, in late 1999 HCFA mandated OASIS data collection for skilled leve l patients at all ce rtified agenc ies. CMS is now m oving forward with planning for OB QI nationally. While all \"nonidentifier\" OASIS item s are used for OBQI, only selected OASIS data item s are used to ca se m ix adjust per episode paym ents under the ne wly im plemented PPS for certified agencies. Industry representatives con cerned exclusively with paym ent have suggested reducing OASIS to only those item s currently used for paym ent and elim inating other OASIS items used for OBQI (and for potential futu re ref inements to case m ix adjustm ent of paym ent rates). The dem onstration finding s suggest this would be a disservice to patients, providers, and payers concerned about quality m onitoring and im provem ent. The im pact of OBQI on hospitalization rate s reinf orces its va lue in lowering ho spi- tal inpatient e xpenditures by preven ting hosp italization f or patients adm itted f rom the community, or rehosp italization of patien ts admitted f rom acute hospitals. The findings reported here im ply that quality HHC can pr event hospitalization, a prem ise that had been 2002 Center for Healt h Services Researc h, UC HSC, De nver, CO 19 called into qu estion by earlier research.10 The pre sent resu lts are derived m ore directly from hom e health program s focused on quality improvem ent, whereas the earlier research was based on areawide analyses for all hom e health agencies in m etropolitan areas, m ost of which did not have f ormal quality im provem ent program s. 2. Reasons for OBQI Successes and Areas for Continued Development After the dem onstrations were concluded, the s taff of m ost particip ating agenc ies continued to use OBQI. Dem onstration agency staff generally exhibited a strong sense of ownership of OBQI (and OASIS), reflected by the m anner in which they adapted OBQI to their agency's day-to-day operations. Several factors accounted for the successes of the OBQI dem onstration program s. First, inform ation obtained, analyzed, and used in feedback reports is precise, understandable, and of practical value for clinicians. Second, when im plemented correc tly, requis ite d ata items and CQI activities can be in tegrated into and repla ce cu rrent item s and activitie s rather than add subs tantially to the d ay-to- day operational routine of clinic al staff. Third, th e OBQI applications fram ework encourage s clinic al staff and quality im provem ent coordina tors to be rigo rous and innovative in areas such as (1) choosing ta rget outcom es; (2) isolating im portant care behaviors to chang e in their agency o r care env ironm ent; (3) writi ng a focused plan of action docum enting target care behaviors to change, how to change them , who is respon - sible for changes, how changes will be im plem ented and m onitored, and when these various activities are to occur; and (4) m otivating ot her clinicians to change. Such factors serve as the ba sis for prov iding inf ormative f eedback to c linicians e rise to a flexible and pragm atic approach to enhancing outcom es. An important featu re of the OBQI fram ework is that it does not rely exclusively on a for mula-driv en appro ach such as clinical guidelines, care m aps, or clinical paths for specific patient problem s (although these can be used in the process-of-care investiga - tion). Rather, it relies on practical feedback of a statistical nature and, m ost im portantly, challenges clinicians to exercise sound judge ment and innovation to isolate strengths and weaknesses in care behaviors or practices with in the contex t of their specific agen cy or clinical group. The above conclusions on outcom e-enhanci ng behaviors were obtained by review - ing written plans of action and speak ing with clin icians and clinical m anagers at dem on- stration agencies in person or by phone. As OBQI research proceeds, additional findings and conclusions will be dissem inated on spec ific clinical, techni cal, and coordinative methods used by hom e care providers to e nhance outcom es. Future publications will address such m ethods and provi de findings specific to i ndividual outcom es (other than hospitalization), based on subgroups of patients and agencies. The m aterial in Supporting Docum ent 8 (Volum e 3) represents a starting po int for such inf ormation. When annual risk-adjusted OBQI outcom e reports becom e available for all Medicare-certified hom e health ag encies nati onally, they will represent a resource to physicians, case m anagers, and discharge pl anners for m aking referral decisions and ultim ately for m onitoring pa tient outcom es. Because the current 41 outcom es span a range of patient health status indicators, it will be possible for physicians to determ ine the streng ths of hom e health agencies accordi ng to different types of outcom es. New 2002 Center for Healt h Services Researc h, UC HSC, De nver, CO 20 outcom es will becom e availab le to augm ent the o riginal 41. Phys icians, other clinicians, and even payers will likely becom e more active in the OBQI proces s. While nonphysician staff played the m ore si gnificant roles in enhancing quality in most dem onstration agencies, it was apparent in s everal agen cy-level OBQI program s that physician involvem ent was substantial a nd could have a pronounced CQI effect. The potential value of physician involvem ent has recently been reinforced in a hom e-based prim ary care program sponsored by the Departm ent of Veterans Affairs.28 In general, however, comm unication between physicians and hom e health agency staff needs to improve for physician involvem ent to be truly effective in an HHC-based OBQI environm ent. 3. A National OBQI Program to Improve the Quality of HHC CMS's national orientation and training program s for OASIS data collection and OBQI are patterned after analogous program s used in the dem onstration trials. Under nationwide im plementation, training and d ata m anagem ent program s are or will b e administered a t the sta te level. OASIS data a re transm itted to a state agency and then to a centr al na tiona l repo sitory for outcom e reporting and case mix adjusting paym ent rates. At this writing, (1) case m ix and adverse even t reports have been m ade available to all agencies in th e United S tates, (2) OASIS da ta have been u sed for cas e mix adjustm ent during the first year of pros pective paym ent, and (3) planning is underway for national OBQI training and the first round of risk-adjusted outcom e reports for all certified agencies. The outcom e reports will serv e as the basis for OBQI and CQI at the agen cy level. They a lso will a ssist the Medicar e survey and certifica tion process by providing more specific inform ation to identify strong hom e health program s that need relatively little attention as well as p rogram s in need of greater im provem ent. A pilot program is underway to facilitate the i nvolvem ent of Quality Im provem ent Organization s (QIOs), previously known as Peer Review Organizations (PROs), in assisting hom e health agencies to im plem ent and use OBQI for outcom e enhancem ent. This program also builds on the training and technical assistance approaches used in the dem onstration trials. OASIS-based ou tcom e measures are now being used by m any accredited hom e health agencies pa rticipa ting in the Jo int Comm ission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organization's ORYX progra m that fo cuses on perform ance indicators. As experience is gained with outcom e repor ts, it is reason able to assum e that som e stream lined version of OBQI reports w ill be availab le to the public. While public repo rt- ing on perform ance of health care provider s rem ains controversial, a general tendency toward such reporting is apparent.29, 30 Initial exper ience with OBQI reports f or all ce agencies would a reasonab public repo rting is im plem ented. 4. Evolution and Refinement Whether the OBQI effects observ ed in th e demonstration trial can be replicated or approxim ated m ore widely or over longer tim e periods rem ains to be seen. The OASIS data set, the outcom e measures derived and ri sk adjusted through the OASIS data set, and the total OBQI fram ework should not be view ed as work com pleted. Their continued evolution and im provem ent is im perative. A foundation now exists for a national OBQI program for HHC, but there is m uch to do. Refinem ents will be need ed interm ittently in areas su ch as revis ed OASIS data item s for OBQI and paym ent purposes. Improved 2002 Center for Healt h Services Researc h, UC HSC, De nver, CO 21 interrater reliability f or som e data item s is attainable. Progressively m ore explanatory power of variation in outcom e measures and greater interagency equity can be achieved through im proved risk adjustm ent and enhanced precision of data. New outcom e measures can be developed and incorporated into ou tcom e reports and adverse event reports, including com posite outcom e measures for m ore general perform ance evaluation. Gaps and area s to im prove will n aturally be iden tified as OASIS, outcom e measures, and OBQI principles are used m ore extensivel y by hom e care clinicians, physicians, adm inis- trators, su rvey and certification prog rams, QIOs, program s, accrediting bod ies, state governm ents, federal agencies, and rese archers. Obviously, it will be im portant to secure input from individuals representing th ese various perspectives to guide the neces - sary evolution and plan an approach for implementing provem ents. Experim entation with the OBQI fram ework m ay prove useful and contribute to enhanced CQI in other domains of health c are. The im plication s of the findings presented here for em erging CMS program s and for other applicat ions are discussed in Volum e 1. 2002 Center for Healt h Services Researc h, UC HSC, De nver, CO 22 Referen ces 1.
