He pursued further the healing properties of essential oils for their qualities. However, use of herbs, plants and shrubs in healing has been around for centuries with Egyptians using them to preserve their dead and Romans carrying herbs during their marches to heal wounds. Plants, herbs and shrubs posses qualities to help us heal, lift our spirits and bring sense of wellbeing. In this collection you will find a range of essential oils, candles, jewellery, bathing, skin goodies and more. Use as a means to cleanse, clear, ground, spell/ritual or just for a good ol' pamper session! I hope you find what you need! Essential oils are best kept in a cool, dry, dark location to maximize their lifespan. Excessive heat and moisture can cause spoiling and prolonged strong sunlight can dry and fade them. Please ensure you read up and research essential oils due to contraindications that some may have with pregnancy, blood pressure, epilepsy and other health conditions, please consult with your GP prior to using holistic therapies. No responsibility can be held by Spirit Esoterica for exacerbation of conditions or issues when using these essential oils. Ensure they are diluted correctly if using on skin and patch test first. - [NEW!
