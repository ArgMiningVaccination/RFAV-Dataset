Marino for the fitst time last month to discuss similar hate crimes legislation. Libby Post, co-chairperson of thc New York State Lesbian and Gay Lobby, said she and Lobby Executive director Jim Perry were invited to meet with Marino after lobby members held a sit-in outside the senator's office on June 19. This was thc first time les\u00ad bian and gay lobbyists had met with a Republican senate majority leader, Post said. Marino said on June 6 that the bias-crime bill was dead for this session of thc State Legislature after a 90-minutc, closed-door meeting of Republicans. Senate Republicans feared thc precedent that might be set by creating special penalties for crimes commit- ted against certain groups* he said. People should be punished for any crimes, regardless of the race, religion or sexual orientation of the victim, Marino added. Ac their meeting with Marino, Post said, she and Perry discussed the bias-crime bill and the possibility of the senator introduc\u00ad ing, in the nexc legislacurc session, a repor\u00ad ting NU that would set up a statewide ntechanism to collect statistics on bias- related crimes. ** Marino said he would work on it in the fall,\" P(M\u00bb9gM. \"He wAnt* to work with us on the omnibus (gay rights] bill. He seems open; he said the 'L' and 'G' words, not *you people' or 'you homosexuals'.\" Marino said he was also disturbed that the lobby hasn t worked with Republican legislators in the past, Post said, but she and Perry told the senator that Republicans haven't seemed interested in working with lesbian and gay leaders. The bias-crime bill raises penalties for crimes committed against people solely because of their sexual orientation, race, religion, age, national origin, disability or sex.

The women were protesting a state law that prohibits women from going topless under most circiunstacKrcs. They were charg\u00ad ed with exposing of a peison, a violation that carries a mayjnuim penalty of 50 days in jail and a $500 fine, and released. .

Washburn Jr, who in January 19S8 revealed his battle with AIDS to help educate the public, died on Jiine 22 in Santa Fe, N.M. He was 50. Washburn died in his sleep at about 9:30 p.m. EST, friends told thc Times-Vnion. Washburn had been traveling and leading workshops on AIDS education until about two months ago, but his health had deteriorated and he had become extremely fatigued in the past several weeks, according lo Dr. William Valenti, a local AIDS expert who was Washburn's friend and former physician. ^^(^hbum was being cared for by his sister, Patti, who lived with him in Santa Fe. His family gathered privately in Santa Fe after Washburn's death, in keeping with his wishes. A memorial service will be held at Asbury First United Methodist Church in Rochester sometime in July. W^hbum vi'as the first prominent peiM>n in the Rochesier area to go public with an AIDS diagnosis. He spoke about AIDS local\u00ad ly and around the country to educators, students, church and community groups, and on television and radio. \"Wie must directly and explicitly discuss sexuality. . . in our schools, in our homes, in our churches;' he told the TU in 1988. \"Kids need to know they don't get AIDS from sitting on toilet seats, eating baloney sandwiches or riding school buses. They get AIDS from sex and from drugs.\" Washburn first began showing symptoms of AIDS in October 1984. In April 1987, while suffering from a bout of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, he began to plan his memoriai service. But he began to recover and decided to bring his homosexuality and his diagnosis out of the closet and devote his remaining time to educating people about the disease. \u2014 Ronny Frishman, Carol Eisenberg, Patricia Braus in the Times-Union; J.

As I write, V^hbum has been dead three days. Many who had worked with him praised Washburn as a great teacher He spoke to thousands, probably tens of thousands, of people \u2014 students, educators, church and community groups, TV and radio audiences and newspaper readers \u2014 and sent useful messages about the value of talking frankly about an epidemic with no cure and only one prcvencion method \u2014 education. There are always chose who won't be educated, of course. I have kept in the Emp\u00ad ty Closet's \"John Washburn\" folder a letter to thc editor published in thc March 17, 1988 Times-Union. It reads: **I must raise serious objection to informed thc AIDS find abhorrent t>oth the melodramatic account and thc personal response of this pa\u00ad tient to AIDS. It is one thing to advocate sym\u00adpathy for a suffering human being and another to lionize a man whose aaions afgue a repulsive aberration. **Thete are multitudes of former cancer patients whose painfully unassisted deachs, accepced and deified, are mocked by che coctunendation of VC^hbum*s easy and self- directed conclusions. **Sympathy driven to such extremes is worse than maudlin; it*s dehumanizing and absurd!\" I know millions of people feel this way about people wich AIDS. I find ic sad and in\u00ad furiating, though, thac che man who wroce this letter is an educator, one of my fonner college instructors. Washburn \u2014 armed with a loving family, a good education and an income that allow\u00ad ed him to finish his life in the city he loved, Santa Fe \u2014 battled ignorance, fear and anti\u00ad gay hatred while fighting a war with a fatal disease. He knew he would be attacked, publicly and privately, by people like my former instructor and even by fellow gays, but he was bravely outspoken and dignified to the end. It's too bad everyone Isn't like that. A fond faxiewell? I've spent an interesting, challenging and rewarding cwo years editing the Empty C/oiser, and I'm excited and a litde sad at>out moving on to other projects. My byline will still be in tbe paper (perhaps in **Biline$'*) whenever a writing mood strikes me. Fortunately, the Gay AlHance has found a successor, Susan Jordan, who is an ex\u00ad perienced writer and editor and has been ac\u00ad tive in the lesbian and gay community and other movements for many more years chan L Jordan will take over the edicor*s job on July 1, and I'll be out of her way as soon as I can pack my junk and remove it from the office. Susan is a founding member of the Feittitiist Review of the New Wbmen's Times, the monthly feminist newspaper published here in thc the late 1970s and early i980s. She was the co-editor of the Review from 1982 to 1984, has published two books of poetry and has written poetry and reviews for thc Writers & Books journal And, the feminist journal Ikon and thc Bmpty Closet. She has also worked on the local Interna\u00ad tional Women's Day planning committee; thc South African Rochester Anti-Apartheid Coalition; the Metro-Act Sister City/Ciudad Hermana Task Force, which runs a project pairing Rochester with a town in Nicaragua; and, in the late '709 and early '80s, Rochester Women Against Violence Againsc Women. Susan brings to the job editorial and political experience, enthusiasm and a work\u00ad ing knowledge of the joys and chaUenges of volunteer-run, nonprofit publications and organizacions. I hope she has as much fun \u2014 and morc \u2014 working on che paper as I did. I can cruchfully tell her that it's often enjoyable and there's never a boring moment. I want to thank everyone who has helped me with the paper in the last two years. Ob- vioifsly I couIdn*t have done it without all of you. I don't have enough space to list names, unfortunately. When I sat down to make up a list of volunteers for Susan, I came up with at least several dozen names of peo\u00ad ple who help with various aspects of the paper's production. You know who you arc \u2014 please pat yourselves on the back. But the paper always needs new volunteers for everything from office work to newspaper delivery to newswriting. If anyone has a spare hour or two you don't know how to spend this summer, call us at 244-9030. Letters Health netw^ork endorses HIV testing lb the Editor.* We urge all members of the community to read thc article by Martin Delaney on HIV testing in this issue of the Empty Closet. Members of the Lesbian and Gay Health Net\u00ad work of thc Gay Alliance of Genesee Valley endorse Delaney's views on tescing, a rever\u00ad sal of thc views commonly expressed in thc past in our community.

Boy love does not create victims lb the Editors 1 was glad to see ^^NAMBLA: Boy-lovers are not child abusers\" (Empty Cltfset^ May 2). Gay boys often seek out sex with men, as anybody knows who has read such rcader- wriccen gay porn classics as Boyd McDonald's Smut, Cum, Flesh, Meat, etc. 1 had a relationship with a man when I was 14. It helped make bearable my life in a homophobic high school and I remember it fondly Despi^ the fact thac I initiated and pursued my friend Bob, under New York's age-of-consem law I was \"raped,\" and Bob could have gone to jail for many years. Luckily, I didn't fall into thc clutches of thc police or social workers, who would have ignored che reality of my experience and insisted 1 was a \"victim.\" But many boys are not so lucky, and chere are probably chousands of men languishing in U.S. jails, sometimes for life, for wholly consensual gay relationships. It's a pity the lesbian and gay press large\u00ad ly ignores their plight. Such silence is presumably intended to placate the straights who, as the government's nonresponse to thc AIDS crisis shows, would gladly sec all of us dead. It's a silence that should be broken. That column was a good start. Bill Andriette, Ithaca Low^ bail for skinheads sendis w^rong message The Empty Closet received a copy ofthis letter, which was sent to the editorial pages of the Democrac & Chronicle and the Times-Union. lb the Editor: lb those \"skinheads\" who don'c like homosexuals, Macks and others, who brutal\u00ad ly beat up a gay man in Highland Park, I ask, \"How do you get so hateful so young?\" It is sad, the hate you feel for people you don't even know. lb the city police officers who apprehend\u00ad ed these criminals, I thank you for a job well done. The victim surely would have been killed. Ic must be fhistrating for the police to enforce che law when che juc^ lets such sick individuals go. lb the judge who placed a mere $250 bail on these skinheads, you sent che message \"It's OK CO beac up gay and Black people.\" This is disgraceful. As a responsible citizen who served my country and received an honorable discharge from the army. I regret that the skinheads roam che streets assaulting law-abiding citizens. I believe the judge is telUng the gay and lesbian community and the Black communicy Chat we are second- class cicizens. I am uncomfortable with Sheriff Meloni ^d the way he runs his department. In May 1986 two of his deputies harassed and discriminated against me. Meloni approved of their actions. He said that because i am gay I am not protected by the law. Meloni's message is that discrimination is OK; this at\u00ad titude contributes to the hate and violence w^c arc experiencing now. 1 want the law-abiding citizens of this ci\u00ad ty and county to know why he won't get my vote. Wc thc people will not stand for discrimination. Wc don't need a sheriff or a judge who condones discrimination against anyone. That is not what America is about. Andrew C. Allocco, Rochester Gay community shouid end stereotyping To the Editor: On May 21, I went to sec the AIOS Quilt at Monroe Community College. Wbrds can\u00ad not express the way I felt when I began to look ac che fii^c panels on the floor. I'm sure you know rhe feeling of a broken heart. Waking into the room, 1 felt my heart bleed for every person who has died of AIDS and all che people who are living wich it. While looking at the individual panels. I thought. \"Wow, these panels arc beautiful. Look at how detailed some of them are.\" But as I observed their uniqueness, 1 began to read their messages. Some were from lovers, others from friends and family Each was a personal reminder that AIDS is a killer, and it's killing our friends and family. 1 consider the Rochester gay communicy a family. We arc all gay, so w^hy do we not treat each other as such? My attention is directed particularly toward thc younger generations of homosexuals in this city. Our lifestyle is sadly suppressed and disliked by thc homophobic society we live in. I am a regular in thc city's bar scene and 1 sec what goes on there. I see men walking around with their noses in the air, believing they are God's gift to men. I also see plenty of gossiping and laughing at one another Why do wc have to act like chis? Wc have enough problems in the scraight world by day; I don't believe wc need them compounded with idle gossip at night. Our social life should be a time when we can get out and relax. Wc must leam to support each other if we're ever going to get anywherc in this world. Thc stereotyping chat goes oh wichin our community has co stop 1 hear such things as \"Oh, did you see who he went home with last night?\" \"What a slue*\" and \"Look at her, doesn'c she chink she's hot lookin'.\" I get sick and tired of the talk and games.

This has given me the courage to contact NAMBLA. I know now of the support given, and realize that there are others out there who feel as I do \u2014 left out, made to feel alone because you don't dare Ulk to ochers about yourself and how you feel. This was very welcome information. I am ^4 years old, and like J.E.K. had a telationship with my best friend wtio I grew up with since birth, it seems, starting about 10. At the same time, I aiso had a mentor ^ho took care of mc and I took care of him. in many more ways than Just the sexual. (You can disregard the crap you hear that this only happens to kids from broken or abusive homes. 1 have no complaints to Ihis day of my home or family life, either then or now.) Even though, sexually, I grew out of attrac\u00ad tiveness for him, we still maintain a nonsex\u00ad ual reUtionship. I have sympathy for J. E.K. that his was not as enriching an experience as mine. I feel that I received by far the greater share of rewards from the give-and- take with \"Jim.\" This is a society where gentle expressions of boy-love arc increasingly difficult due to the heavy-handedness of the state. John Q. PubUc has violent and sometiines other bad images of us, and this crowds out all other ims^es. They have to have certain groups to beat up on, 1 guess. What scares them about us? It's that deep down, there isn't that much difference between us. May the work of NAMBLA and the courage of ochers give us strength. Brian J.

Camp Good Days sponsors prognun for chUdren of people with AIDS Camp Good Days and Special Times Inc., a camp for children with cancer and their siblings, and AIDS Rochester Inc. are spon\u00ad soring a weekend camp in July for children who have a parent or sibling with AIDS. The July 28-30 weekend is modeled after two Camp Good Days programs for children who have a brother, sister or parent with cancer. The programs combine traditional camping and recreational activities with medical atui psychosocial prognuns such as play therapy. \"It'll piovide an informal, relaxed setting for [the campers], with kids who are goit% through the same thing,** Parks said. The idea for the program originated when a volunteer helping with an AIDS Rochester stipport group wrote to Camp Good Days fotuider and chairman Gary Mervis to ask if the cjunp had any programs for adults deal- hig with AIDS. The camp's administrsttion began consulting with local AIDS experts and investigating the idea of a program for chUdren, said Caroline Parks.

In a 40-page annual rcport \u2014 \"Anti-Gay Violence, Victimization and Defamation in 1988\" \u2014 released June 1, the task force says the incidents reported in 1988 exceed the total for 1987 by 3 percent, or 240 incidents, marking the largest number of anti-gay in\u00ad cidents ever documented in a single year. The document also shows that local gay groups recorded 70 homicides in 1988 that occurred in anti-gay attacks, an increase of 9 percent over thc previous year New York had the fifth-highest number of anti-gay incidents by state, with 625- Lesbian and gay groups on college campuses in Binghamton, Brooklyn, Buffalo, Clinton, New York City, Poughkeepsie, Stony Brook and Syracuse, as well as thc Buffalo chapter of Metropolitan Community Church and thc New York City Gay & Lesbian Anti-Violence Project, reported incidents. In New York Ci\u00ad ty, the police Bias Incident Investigating Unit documented a 79 percent rise in thc number of reported anti-gay crimes in 1988, the largest increase of any type of bias crime in the city last year. The local groups, which complete a year\u00ad ly task force questionnaire on anti-gay violence, reponed 885 incidems of physical assault, 713 threats of violence or menacing, 449 acts of vandalism, 54 bomb threats and nine acts of arson. The repon also says there were 205 episodes of police officers engag\u00ad ing in verbal or physical abuse of lesbians and gay men. Verbal harsissment accounted for 4,835, or 67 percent, of the total number of anti-gay incidents. Of the total incidents documented, 19 per\u00ad cent took place on college and university campuses. Six percent of the incidents were directed at Mctropoliun Community Chur\u00ad ches, the Christian congregations, usually headed by openly gay pastors, which do outreach to the lesbian and gay communi\u00ad ty. Kevin Berrill, director of the task force's Anti-Violence Projea, said the task force made a special effort to obtain data from MCC congregations and gay and lesbian cam\u00ad pus groups this year following reports in thc lesbian and gay press that both groups fre\u00ad quently experience anti-gay harassment. \"Today's report is our annual wake-up call to the American people,\" Berrill said at a June 7 press conference to announce the report's release. \"It is our reminder to the nation that thc price of anti-gay bigotry is paid in human lives lost and in immeasurable suffering for thc victims, their loved ones I YET MORE LIGHT. . .

Denmark legalizes gay marriage COPENHAGEN, Denmark \u2014 The Danish parliament voted in late May, by a 71-47 margin, to legalize lesbian and gay marriages. The law is expected to take effect Oct. L Queen Maigaret II must sign the legislation, but activists here say obtaining her signature is a formality. The law received widespread support from members of parliament (MPs) of several diffeient parties. All five MPs from thc Chris\u00ad tian Folk Party, however, voted against the legislation and said they planned to call for a pubtic referendum. Thc law will elevate gay men and lesbians to the status of married heterosexuals in every atea except the adoption of children. The measure also does not grant lesbians and gays thc right to marry in churches; the ceremonies can be performed in city halls. I Gay and lesbian activists in Denmark are I working to change both of those restrictions. ' Several gay legal scholars have begun ex\u00ad ploring whether a Danish gay marriage would have to be recognized by govemments in the United Sutes. \u2014 Rex Wockner in Philadelphia Gay Ne%vs Hunger striker with AIDS ends fast SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A lawyer with AIDS who began a hunger strike to demand the NAYIM A Group for Jewish Gays and Lesbians For more information: Beth Bloom 442-3363 Scott Cohen 546-1381 passage of comprehensive laws prohibiting cUscrimination agaitist gay men, Ic^ians and people with AIDS or HIV has ended his fast. Stuart McDonald, 33, began his hunger strike on Jan. 2 and ended it after 4-1/2 months, admitting that the protest didn't generate the govemment acttons he had hoped for. His weight dropped from 210 to 125 pounds whiie he fasted. McDonald had demanded that California Gov. George Dukemajian and President George Bush guarantee the civil rights of people with AIDS. Both officials expressed general support for those with the disease and expressed concem for McDonald^s health, but they didn't voice support for legal protections. *'.. . instead of helpix^ the lesbian and gay community by my death, I came to believe that thc community would become even more disheartened and demoralized,'* McDonald said at a press conference an< nouncing the end of his fast. \u2014 Philadelphia Gay News Test may take up to 3 years to detect HIV A report published in the June 1 New Etigiand Journal of Medicine suggests that current tests used to determine whether a person has been exposed to the HIV virus may fail to detect infection in almost one in four people for as long as three years after exposure. Researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles studied blood samples taken every six months from 133 gay men who were engaging in high-risk sexual activities. All of the men tested negative on the stan\u00ad dard ELISA and W\u00bbtem blot tests, but lesear- chers found evidence of thc human im\u00ad munodeficiency virus, or HIV, in 31 (23 per\u00ad cent) of the men using a morc sophisticated test. Of these 31, evidence indicated that 27 had been infected with thc AIDS virus for as long as 28 to 36 months. The remaining four had been infected for between 11 and 17 months before testing positive on thc standard antibody tests. Previously, researchers believed that most people infected with HIV developed detec\u00ad table levels of thc AIDS antibody within about six months. Later research determin\u00ad ed that a significant number of people could take as long as 14 months to develop such antibodies. This study indicates that perhaps one in four infected people may take as long as three years to develop the antibodies to a level that can be detected by the standard tests in use today. The researchers wam in their report that the number of research subjects is \"very small, and definitive conclusions cannot be drawn.' They speculate that the four men who eventually tested positive for antibodies may have been infected once with one strain of HIV that for some reason was not able to replicate, then reinfected at a later point with a different strain that was capable of replication. \u2014 Lisa M.

That optimism was, in many ways, coerc\u00ad ed by an extremely vocal and visible presence at the conference of people with AIDS and AIDS aaivists. An organized coati\u00ad tion of activists from New York City and Canada Uterally hijacked Sunday everung's opening ceremony to demand that resear\u00ad chers and public health officials \"treat HIV disease positively and aggressively as a chronic, manageable condition.*' A ntmiber of prominent researchers at the conference expressed the belief that ad* vances in drug research \u2014 against both HIV and the opportunistic infections that often accompany immune suppression \u2014 could move the overall AIDS prognosis in that direction.

Ttm. and the continuing lack of cer\u00ad tainty about how many HIV-itifected people will go on to develop AIDS, left a persistent cloud over much of the new-found optimism. A few findings reported at the conference: Ruth Berkclman of the Centers for Disease Control reported that '*the majorl- ry of AIDS cases among gay and bisexual men in the United States has yet to be reported.\" But epidemiological studies of gay men in New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco suggest that the rate of infcrc- tion among gay men may have peaked bet\u00ad ween 1980 and 1982. Researchers could postulate that the AIDS epidemic ainong gay and bisexual men will t>egin leveling now and into the early 1990s. *U.S. Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Health James Mason confirm- ed that public health officiais arc develop\u00ad ing a reconunendation to make aerosol Pen\u00ad tamidine available to HIV-infected people whose T<:ell counts arc under 200 but who have yet to develop AIDS-related syit^Moms.

Famed polio vaccine discoverer Dr. Jonas Salk revealed that inununization with kiUed HIV virus might have the potential to cause the live HIV virus to disappear in already- infected subjects. Scientists cautioned, however; that this potential ** post-infection prophylaxis*' demonstiaeed its restdts in only two of three chin:q>anzces. The results were demonstrated in an extremely sraaU and preliminary study, and chimps are known not to develop AIDS anyway, researchers said. Scientists ;^n confirmed A2T's ability to prolong the survival of HIV-infected peo\u00ad ple, but they reported that the virus alters Itself and becomes resistant to the drug as quickly as six months after therapy begins. Investigations into the severity of the numerous side effects associated with AZT arc revealing for the first time that many of the side effects may lessen or disappear as therapy continues. A study of 262 gay men showed that almost one-third of men using condmns dur\u00ad ing anal intercourse with other men reported experiencing at least one condom hUlure during sex.

Our communicy is lapidly splitting into two diverse groups: those who have already taken thc test and arc acting on its implica\u00ad tions and those who haven*t and arc sick of hearing at>out it. If this second group in\u00ad cludes you, I urge you to keep on reading as if your life depended on it. It may. Most of us have heard thc arguments for knA against testing ad nauseum. For every good reason to take the test, someone can raise a seemingly good r\u00abwon not to. Even well-meaning AIDS service organizations have fueled thc confusion with ads show\u00ad ing scales in balance \u2014 \"^on thc one hand, and on thc other hand\" \u2014 leading many to conclude that testing is simply a matter of personal preference. That just isn't so. Not anymore. There arc profoundly important medical reasons why you must leam your antibody status as soon as possible. If you don't, you may needless\u00ad ly the Two important facts lead to this conclusion: l.Thc most common and most deadly killer associated with AIDS \u2014 Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PC?) \u2014 has become a controllable disease. People who are at short-tcnn risk of getting this in\u00ad fection can now use safe, effective treatment to prevent it. The catch: they must first know they arc at risk, a process that begins with taking thc test. Thc alternative is to wait for thc infection to aimouncc itself and to deal with thc consequences \u2014 including the AIDS diagnosis that comes with it. 2. There is a growing belief among many physicians, researchers and patients that thc best time to begin treating HIV infection is a* soon as possible. There is considerable evidcticc that available medicine, when us\u00ad ed early enough and properly, can dnmaticaily slow or stall thc p\u00abx>grcssion ot HIV infection toward AIDS, with fewer side effects than when such medicines arc used later. PCP prevention alone is a sufficient reason to warrant wide-scale voluntary and anonymous testing. Nearly 65 percent of all AIDS patients receive their diagnosis as a result of PCP, and an equal percentage die ofit. Using available blood tests, physiciatts are Hnding it possible to predict who is in imminent danger of contracting PCP; using available medicine, physicians are finding it possible to prevent PCP. The second closet This is wonderful, hopeful news. But a great many people haven't heard it; they are still in che ''second closet;' hiding their HIV sUtus from themselves and their doctors. Even some who have heard thc news resist, arguii^ that we do not know how many seropositives will get sick, so there is no point in stirring everyone up. On thc contrary, we do know how many people will become sick if left untreated: most, if not all, of them. Although resear\u00ad chers diss^ree on thc exact numt)er5, every | long-term study points in the same upward direction, with virtually all thc studies con\u00ad cluding that thc majority of those infected are progressing toward illness, if not AIDS itself. One of thc most often-cited studies has reported that 78 percent of HIV-infected people developed immune-related disorders within seven years after infeaion: roughly 35 percent with full AIDS, 42 percent with lesser symptoms. Other studies have sug\u00ad gested that it may take, on thc average, 11 years to develop full AIDS. Although debate continues on thc precise figures, only outright denial and very rosy glasses could lead HIV seropositives to expect a free pass. Thc same studies state that thc greatest rate of infection in \"ground zero\" communities \u2014 San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York \u2014 occurred between 1978 and 1982. After that, safer sex and raised consciousness drove the rate of new infection drastically (io'ov nward. This has profound implications. Assuming an average infection point somewhere bet\u00ad ween 1978 and 1982, one can predict that 1989 through 1993 will t>\u20ac critical years: i''-c*-a 0. *-\"- AIDS L-o c:-^^:^^ ( Christ Church July 20 i Jii great number of those walking around today in blissful ignorance of their HIV status are going to get sick. There arc only two ways to find out if this includes you: take the test, voluntarily and anonymously, or wait until you get sick. If you take the test, you can get the results on a day you choose, at a time when you have lined up the appropriate support and have obtained any needed information and when you still have thc best possibic medical options in front of you. If you leam by waiting for an oppor\u00ad tunistic infection, you're likely to get the news by surprise, at a time when you least expect it, when you arc unprepared to hear it and when your future medical options may have already been diminished. Ear too many gay men continue to take the second option, usually acting on the assump\u00ad tion that they will have minor symptoms or viraming signals before a serious infection like PCP sets in. Were it only thc case. While some people do have symptoms, others go directly from seemingly good health to ho^italization with PCP, sometimes in as lit\u00ad tle as a month. Predicting the short-term risk of PCP re\u00ad quires only a simple blood test, available from any doctor: thc T cell subset test, which yields thc T4 count, a number typical\u00ad ly between zero and 1,500. While not a perfect predictor, thc T4 count is far more accurate than playing wait and see. Informa\u00ad tion that will soon be released from a Na\u00ad tionai Institutes of Health study concludes that, on the average, people risk coming down with PCP when their T4 count falls t>elow 200. Thus, thc T4 test tells when it is time to begin using preventive treatment against PCP. When such treatment is employed, PCP can be held at bay for many months or perhaps indefinitely. Civil lit>ertics, psychological concerns What, then, of the civil rights and psychological concerns about testing? Since these issues are raised so frequently elsewhere, 1 will only briefly mention them here. (Oddly enough, it is the medical atgu- ment in fevofof testing that is underreported in the media). Civil Ul>erties demand that testing t>e ationytnous (using a code number or mt least not a real name) and vofuntary (done freely at a time you choose). When a person waits for illness to armoimcc the infection, civil rights concerns almost always go out thc window, since in virtually all sutes an AIDS diagnosis must be reported. The psychological concerns \u2014 that a positive test result could create emotional burdens or even drive someone to depres\u00ad sion or suicide \u2014 arc also teal but sometimes oversuted. Depression and suicide seem most Ukely when testing is not accompanied by proper support services. With help and after a week or two of confusion, righteous aftger and scrambling for information, most reasonably well-balanced people pick themselves up and get on with their lives. The lack of any counseling services means that a person is in thc wrong place to get tested. Is testing, then, thc right answer for everyone? Whatever the general recommen\u00ad dation, there will always be exceptions. Peo\u00ad ple who are emotionally incompetent pro\u00ad bably have little to gain from knowledge of their antit>ody status, although their doaors may have good reason to know. Someone in a temporarily fragile emotional state should wait for a more secure moment. The better question might not t>c whether to test but rather, when is the appropriate moment? tlaklng action now Five general categories of intervention are currently available: general health maintenance, holistic or complemenury therapies, antiviral medicine, immune- modulating medicine, and preventive medicine against opportunistic infections. Thc biggest mistake we can make in ex\u00ad ploring these approaches is to assume that we must choose one, as if it were an elec\u00ad tion campaign. No singular method of in\u00ad tervention is sufficient on its own.

A good rule of thumb: when someone makes an intervention a matter of dogma or faith, suggcrsting that it is the on\u00ad ly answer and discouraging use of any others, it's time to look elsewhere. General health maintenance HIV slowly drains one's physical resources. Thus, a well-rounded, healthy lifestyle is the firet stage of defense. This means improved attention to nutrition, pro\u00ad per rest, exercise to maintain body mass and muscle tone and reducing or eliminating use of recreational drugs, smoking and alcohol \u2014 in short, doing all those things that we know arc good for us but that don't always get the attention they deserve. A good way to address this is to engage in a self-assessment of your present lifestyle, including taking a good look in the mirror No magic diets are needed, no knockout ex\u00ad ercise regimens \u2014 just a simple application of common sense. Regarding drug use, it's fairly easy to let your body tell you which chemicals and behavior patterns arc most damaging. If you want to live longer, drop them. Limitations: General health maintenance will give you thc best your body is capable of, but it won't cure you or make other inter\u00ad vention unnecessary. Those who believe that simply exercising and eating well is all they need to do are in for a rude surprise. Nonetheless, taking care of the basics can add significantly to your ability to fight the disease. Holistic or complementary therapies Taking a holistic view means understan\u00ad ding yourself as a full human being physical\u00ad ly, spiritually, psychologically and socially. Loosely grouped under the heading of holistic therapy are such tactics as stress reduction, meditation, visualization, spiritual fulfillment, natural medicine, self- awareness and self-love, massage, counsel\u00ad ing, group activities and social involvement.

ANY FORMAT AVAILABLE 315-483-6261 Rochester's Precision Service Store Unfortunately, a lot of hokum and snake oil are being pitched under the batmer of holistic therapy. The challenge is to deter\u00ad mine what makes sense versus what is so\u00ad meone's fantasy view of the universe. Itue holism is nc^le and meaningful and rNced not be based on psychobabble and mystic healing. Litnitations: Some holistic healers suggest that ail you need is a positive outiook, a hap\u00ad py face and thc avoidance of Western medicine. That's where the hokum comes in. Honest holistic physicians are the first to ad\u00ad mit that they don't have all thc answers or a cure. Thc best holistic practitioners see their approach as a complementary therapy and urge its supportive use alongside the best, proven mainstream medicines. Holistic therapy becomes a problem only when it is promoted to the exclusion of all other ap\u00ad proaches, at which point it becomes dangerous and misleading. Antiviral medicine Antiviral medicine is a new class of medications that are designed to interfere with the activity of a virus. Antiviral medica\u00ad tions cannot kill the virus in the body but can interrupt the reproduction of HIV, hinder its ability to attack healthy cells or stop infected cells from spreading the infec\u00ad tion to others. Thc antiviral best proven to work against HIV is still AZT, although a few others may soon be available. Acyclovir, which acts against the herpes family of viruses, is also believed to be useful, because herpes activi\u00ad ty is known to stimulate HIV. Dextran sulfate, another antiviral, is presently used by many patients who import it from japan, but it is under study and its effectiveness is as yet un\u00ad proven. A few other antiviral medicines, not yet available but under intense study, are thc AZT relatives DDC and DDI, CD4 (the first drug specifically created for HIV), Foscamet and alpha and beta interferon. A number of Chinese herbal mixtures have also been iden\u00ad tified to work against HIV in lab cultures; evidence that they work in the t>ody must a^vait further testing. Limitations: Antiviral research is a relative\u00ad ly new field of medicine that so far has on\u00ad ly had limited success. Although there is lit\u00ad tle question of AZT's benefits, it is not a total solution, and its toxicity makes it difficult to determine the appropriate time to use the drug. The first difficult decision is determining when to begin antiviral therapy. In the earlier years of the epidemic, antiviral drugs were used only when a patient became seriously ill. Over time, the point for t>eginning therapy has moved steadily backward to thc first awareness of infection. Ibday, some top scientists believe that the best time to begin is as early as possible, that simply being seropositive may be reason enough to begin treating che virus. The largest clirdcal study in the country is currently testing this no\u00ad tion, treating 3,000 healthy HlV-positivcs with varying doses of AZT. Yet, conservative physicians express fears that AZT side effects may build up, that the virus might become resistant over time or that AZT will be usable for only a limited time. They conclude it might be best to wait to use the drug only when it is most need- FREEVVHEELERS Expert Repairs & Tune-ups RBUIS DE&IGN 642 South Avenue 473-4440 ed, when serious symptoms occur Most researchers would readily agree to eariy antiviral treatment if a completely non\u00ad toxic drug were available. So fiu, there is no hard evidence of the development of A2T- resistant strains of HIV, and preliminary in\u00ad dications suggest that there arc few serious side effects from AZT in healthy people. Still, some rcsearchers say we need to know what will happen when such drugs are used for 10 to 20 years. The counterargu\u00ad ment is that if someone doesn't use the dn^ now in the short term, he or she won't be around to find out what happens in 10 to 20 years. Almost no one expects AZT to be us\u00ad ed five years from now. Instead, the object of current the^^)y is simply to buy time un\u00ad til better treatments become feasible. Ifmnune-modulatlttg medidne This is a class of medications that are in\u00ad tended to stimulate, modify or rebuild the immune system. Immune-modulating medications currently under study include the French drug Imuthiol and its U.S. relatives Antabuse and the chemical DTC, the interferons, naltrexone (Trexan), the Swedish plant extract Iscador, Colony Stimulating Factors, IMREG and Transfer Factor .Some of these drugs are designed to increase thc declining T4 cell counts charaaeristic of HIV infection, while others seek a balanced stimulation of several immune functions. Limitations: Most scientists recognize that little is known about the immune system. Thus, there is much scientific uncertainty about what constitutes a good result when using immune-modulating medications. Some researchers think that it may be harm\u00ad ful to stimulate an immune system under at\u00ad tack by HIV unless a strong antiviral drug is also in use. Others feel that it is morc impor\u00ad tant to restorc lost immunity to fend off at\u00ad tacks of opponunistic infections. Interest in these kinds of medicine is wide\u00ad ly exploited by purveyors of unproven, over- the-counter remedies sold in health food stores, with promising-sounding names such as ' *lmmune-this'' and ' 'Super-Immune- that.\" Virtually none of these drugs has any proven value in the context of HlV; most have no proven value in any context. Nonetheless, some vitamins and herbal mix\u00ad tures are believed to support immune func\u00ad tions. To recommend any truly useful natural or herbal remedy requires more expertise than the salesperson in a health food store can offer. Preventive medicine a^^alnst oppor\u00ad tunistic Infections This is a class of generally well-established antibiotic and antifungal medications that are used to treat the many infections com\u00ad mon to AIDS patients. In recent years, their use has been rapidly extended as a form of preventive medicine: mild doses of a drug are administered regularly to patients who have not yet had, but are at risk of contrac\u00ad ting, common infections. PCP has become a preventable disease thanks to these medica\u00ad tions. The key to their usefulness lies in iden\u00ad tifying those people who need them and convincing them of the necessity of taking medicine for an infection they may not yet have. Limitations: The form of PCP prevention generally believed to be safest \u2014 aerosol pentamidine \u2014 is expensive and inconve\u00ad nient to use The oral drugs Bactrim and Dapsone also work weU but with a higher risk of side effects; this is a concem when they are beii^ used preventively. Preveiitive treatments for other common infections are not as well developed at present, but we can expect to see progress in the coming year Where we s^uid now^ \u00ab Despite the rapidly-changing debate over early intervention, there are several points most researchers and physicians seem to agree on: Thc need for PCP prevention, starting when a person has about 200 T-cells (and always after an initial bout of PCP or any other serious opportunistic infection, regardless of T-cell count). Some argument remains as to which treatment to use: the ex\u00ad pensive, safe but inconvenient aerosol pen\u00ad tamidine or the inexpensive, convenient, and sometimes morc problematic oral drugs. Beginning treatment when serious symp\u00ad toms indicate immediate danger or when blood markers rcach the lo'cls described in the original FDA approval of AZT (under 200 T4 cells). The use of acyclovir whenever any of the herpes-rclatcd viruses are present. Monitoring a patient's use of unapprov\u00ad ed but promising drugs currently under study, such as dextran sulfate. The treatment debate is increasingly focus\u00ad ed on deciding when the imaginary line is crossed that calls for intervention. Is it at 200 T-cells, 400 T-ceils plus some symptoms, or simply seropositivity and declining T-cells? Does uraiting until serious symptoms occur let the disease go so far that thc patient may never recover full immune response? The answer, for the moment, must be one of personal choice. Highly respected resear\u00ad chers and physicians admit that treatment strategies are clearly shifting toward earlier intervention. Perhaps a year from now, there will be no debate. One thing we do know for sure: there is indeed light shining at thc end of thc tun\u00ad nel. In a recent meeting in VP^hington, the noroiaWy staid top off\\<:taiV& oC t\\%c National Institutes of Health AIDS program were prac\u00ad tically jumping up and down in their chairs in excitement over the progress that has been made and the advances that are on the horizon. Now, more than ever, the challenge is to use all that is at our command to hang on. Wc are very, very close, and some reputable sources believe we are already there for those who begin treatment sufficiendy early.

Phtanct f Enjoy Beittg a Girl, Island Records, 1989. By John E. Till Jr. Is gay supremacy an idea whose time has come? By their ruune, the Frogs (Founding Fatheits of Gay Supremacy) seem to imply that it has, although their first record, /r's Otily Rj^t atid Natural, does not direcdy ad\u00ad dress any political or social issues. Rather, it seems to be a gay addition to the post-punk genre of songs about fucking (Black Flag, Butthole Surfers, etc.) The avoidance of political themes is curious because the Frogs record and per\u00ad form tfieir music in a homophobic society. One expects that an explicitly gay music should have something to say to gay people who live in oppressive conditions \u2014 if not a mess:^ of hope, one at least expects a good protest. The Frogs don't give us politics, but they do give us some pretty offbeat music. Their album is mosdy acoustic guitar music, with some sleazy synth/organ backup. The overall instrumental efifect, as well as the vocals and lyrics, are remirUscent of Cs^>tain Beefhcart. Although the Frogs are something of a political disappointment, their Beefheartian weirdness makes them worth a listen. All of the songs on It's otdy Right and Natural are a celebration (often rather graphic) of gay sex and sexuality. Although **been a month since I had a man\" is quite difTerent in both fbrm and content from the Smith's \"This Charming Man,\" the former may be much more representative of the ex\u00ad perience of being gay in North America. And perhaps in the eroiophobic era of AIDS, the sexual militancy of the Frogs is, indeed, a powerful statement of gay pride and politics.

Most of Phranc's music has a childlike quali\u00ad ty to it; in a gay-positive society, elementary school kids would be singing her songs. Phranc's new album is certainly worth the long wait. It starts off with the title song, which notes that these days it's kind of tren\u00ad dy to l>e a folksinger (Suzanne \\^ga er al.). The record has two anti-racist songs, \"Bloodbath,\" about South Africa, and \"Ikke Off Your Swastika,\" directed at today's youth, in which Phranc correctly states that \"fascism is not anarchy.\" There arc a couple of goofy songs, \"Rodeo Parakeet * and \"The Ballad of Lucy and IM,\" the latter a not-exactly-Mellencampian song about polar bears mauling children. (The song is sympathetic to the polar bears.) There is also a sensitive song, \"Myriam and Esther,\" in which Phranc tries to deal with her aging grandmother's deterioration. The Frogs being apolitical is an important shortcoming of their work, but the develop\u00ad ment of bands like the Frogs is a good sign \u2014 it means that gay culture is asserting itself in new areas. Phranc's music is great, but it's also important that gay punks have a gay punk music. The Frogs are actually quite political; they are struggling to expand the gay cultural presence. They apparently ate dedicated gay su|Memacists: the Frogs understand that their prtcea depencb on witming a gay hegemony in the cultural as well as political spheres.

In high school I began each semester with ticw notebooks, careful peimianship and fresh resolve to t>e attentive and strive harder, but always within weelcs I would be doodlUig, failing myself if not my classes. A new city, considerable independence amd a room of tny own (remed for 98 a week. In 195S, fmm Mr Sam Cronsky, an elderiy widower who worked nights) sustained tne Ibr 10 months, and that year seemed a suc\u00ad cess. A*s in drawitig and design, odier A's smd B's, indicated an tmfiKmiliar validation that served a smail, timely purpose. I had talent. While I often felt uncomfortable with my jcrily peers who commuted frcnn thc suburbs, I seemed to be succeeding, and hoped that an would sustain me. 1 was heading in the right direction, the dead-end feelings of home behind me. I often worked iate into the night on school projects, and then, unable to sleep, walked quietly to Mr Cronsky's kitchen where I had privileges, and from the pint bottle under the sink siphoned off a shot of Four Fcathcni. I'd use tap water to replace what rd drunk. It ne\\'er occurred to mc what Mr. Cronsky thought of his paler, weaker drink; I slept better. On weekends my chums met at nearby bars \u2014 popular with art students, lit majors and actors \u2014 where thc wine was 50 cents. We were enthusiastically bohemian, talking the hours away. At home we listened to Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck or Threepenny Of>era, and re^d Kerouac and Camus. Before we painted a friend's apartment the obligatory white, wc drew grand murals on the walls. VH? also had diverting and painful momen\u00ad tary crushes on upper classmen. But most\u00ad ly it was classwork, modeled on what our teachers did, and afternoons spent in the museum, and on the weekend, foreign movies. While unmet deeper needs stagnated, my imagination thrived, rip'-ned with La Notte, LAventurra, Last \\bar at Marietibad. The classy ennui rang true for me. I wore black turtlenecks all the time. I was unique. On spring evenings I often walked, sheltered under tall trees that lined streets of handsome buildings, a far nicer nei^bc^hood than Td known before. When my walk took me to the avenue, Fd regis^r each passing car \u2014 a habit rooted, no douN, in my adolescent street cruiMng. Loneliness, to which I would not admit, generated a passive, insistent searching, a longing for connection. What had in the past sufRced \u2014 a pick-up \u2014 was absurd in this residen\u00ad tial area miles from the city's cruising distria, as yet unknown to me. To my surprise, a bemused man traveling home from work stopped for me one even\u00ad ing. Later in the night he casually toyed with the ring Td placed on the night stand. This, my finest possession, was crafted from my grandfather's gold cuff links and presented by my aunt upon her arrival in America. After hc*d returned thc ring and my panic passed, he offhandedly suggested a movie date and prescribed for me a costume: jeans, white T-shirt and socks, black shoes. His desire that I align with a fantasy offended mc and as we spoke I knew I'd never keep the date. I doubted our movie tastes would match. For my universe to expand so dramatical ly \u2014 as 1 believed it had \u2014 in a single year, thc yank of the chain that anchored me to Rochester was all the more wrenching. On the Greyhound bus, in June, 1 traveled back to the house with linoleum floors, a shower in the basement and only one downstairs closet, and Saturday chores of yard work and groceries carried home from theA & P. I felt trapped, ashamed. Unaware of my plight, my higb school art teacher nonetheless managed to rescue me. She had labored to have her alma maier ac cept me, but afiter a fast scan of my chemistry and algdl>ra scores, diey*d flipped to the fiext candidate: Ultitnaeely she found sticcess widi a state school. She invited roe to paint in her basemem, a haven 20 tninutes walk from my hou^. That summer, while she chain-smoked Philip Morris cigarettes (her house was fill\u00ad ed with af^liances you could get fbr trading coupons) wc swapped tales <^ her glamorous yean in New York after Syracuse for my modest stories of life in Buffalo. Sophisticated, we'd drink Manhattans. I'd stay for dinner, walk home late in a glow. Mellow one nigjit fiom drink, an old habit surfoced; I went to cruise the Court Street bridge, which I'd shunned for more than a year Laigely to delay going home, a conver\u00ad sation was struck up with a thinnish man \u2014 reminiscent, I mused, of Montgomery Clift \u2014 not really my type at all. The night was humid, heavy with fog. Wc strolled along the river near the darkened War Memorial, then a second man appeared from the shadows and I was abruptly arrested. They escorted me to jail. At that time the city complex had not been built and in its place, on Exchange Street, stood a Charles Addams vision, the police station. It was, ironically, next door to the Rochester Children's Nursery, the day care center 1 had attended during my elementary tny captors and spoke with me. My mother maimaincd that wc could noc afiii^nd afihone and therefore, because she could not be reached, he elected to release me on my own recognisance. I was told lo teport at nine the following ttioming. Hindsight allows that he may have been annoyed with the plalnelothesman who entra|^>ed mc, or for other reasons he did not feel it necessary to ificarcerate me overnight. E had no tbot^ts about that as I tru<^ed home, chilly in the warm air, terrified. I did not sleep. The next moming, from a pay phone, I called my old chum Dodo wfaom Td ignoted since l>ecoming a college man. It seemed similar misfortune had befoUen her (times were changing on the bridge) and she had linle advice and no sympathy. f walked uptown to jail and sat on a wooden seat listening for my name. Finally, when 1 was called I stood and heard the chatges: *'Lewd and indecem conduct... in\u00ad tern to commit acts against nature. . .'^There was more, I think, but nothing registered. I felt hot. It was decided that I should be held over for psychologica] evaluation. An intervieu- date was set two weeks away, enough time not only to brood but also to gather my frac\u00ad tured wits and consider a course of action. Idle time is bland and unnerves mc. I'm bet\u00ad ter in a crisis. But^n fact, I did nothing but wait. Then when 1 was reviewed by a somber man in a tweed jacket, I pleaded that I kneu- i was wrong and wished to charge. I wanftd school years. In those days, we would sneak counseting. I had done well in college; my in to drink cold fountain water, creeping past officers with frosted glass doors, run out, waving goodbye to thc officer on duty behind thc hi^ desk. I stood rigid in dread on this hot July night at the end of my first year in college in front of the night duty officer. He consulted with Bilines: Giving credit w^here credit is dme By Betty Barcode Thc intricate network of orbits in which local activists travel seems so delicately balanced that when one central, hard\u00ad working soul leaves, thc whole system can get jitters, knocked temporarily out of whack. When two dynamic individuais leave, cveryuonc feels it. This month, \"Bilines\" takes a vacation from the usual exploration of bisexual issues to express appreciation for two of the hardest workers in Rochester's gay, lesbian and bisexual community who are exiting im\u00ad portant orbits in the activist constellation. Martin Hiiaga has resigned from the board of the Gay AUiance of the Genesee Valley, and this issue of the Empty Closet is Michele Moore's last as editor. Both will con\u00ad tinue to be active in the community, but when two major talents like Moorc and Hiraga feel thc>' can no longer be effective within an organization supposedly devoted to social change, it's time to ask; \"What's wrong with this picture?\" Michele and Martin have served the Gay Alliance in two different but public capacities; they have often l>een the first fiKcs ofthe Gay Alliance that newcomers en\u00ad counter. In contrast with my first experience at a Gay Alliance coffeehouse, Martin and Michele were welcoming, and committed to inclusion. My eariiest memory of Martin was when he came in the store where I work part-time. Eying a cassette from the Michigan Wbmen's Music Fesdval, he observed that one of the singets was a separatist who performed for and sold records to women-only audiences. Manin was willing to forgo buying the tape if it meant defying her policy, and asked my advice Ibugh call. I decided that a man who genuinely tespecxeA leabian sepatatlsm had money as green as any woman's, and sold the tape to him. Later I learned that tbe singer was no longer a sc^nratlst. Whew. Martin became, and still is, one of my \u00a3vn>rite customets. Durii^ the coHne of our subsequcm Tve gotten an over- political educatkm. I leam the most ftom people wbo don't presume that they have somiethlng to teach me; In the wofds of Joni Mitchell: ''The times ^liicn you impress me the most are the times when you don't try.\" Manin is one such teacher. I later joined the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT-UP/Rochcster) as a neophyte, fired up by Randy Shilts' And the Band Played On, but with clear limitations. 1 had no direct expierience of thc AIDS epidemic, and still struggle with my tenden\u00ad cies to avoid taking public risks and identi\u00ad fying myself politically. Martin has patient\u00ad ly educated me about race and class issues in the sexual minorities community and in the AIDS epidemic, sharing ideas with me that I would not have otherwise en\u00ad countered. He regularly nudges this sometimes-wimpy activist. 1 believe that the Gay Alliance t>oard is los\u00ad ing its conscience as Martin departs this par- ticular orbit. Nominating him for a Vin- nicA^icki Cup award in no way absolves the board for so resisting his attempts to include people of color and the disabled that he quit in frustration. Though Martin and Michele once recruited me to run for a seat on thc board, today I'm unsure I could commit my energies to an organization that sometimes has the familiar white, middle-class tenden\u00ad cy to avoid taking public risics and challeng\u00ad ing itself politically. 1 already know how to do that. Every writer wonders if what she has to say wiU nuuter to anyone but herself. IWo years ago, Michele wrote an essay in the EC that helped me change my Ufe. In it, she came out publically as a bisexual. The tim\u00ad ing could not have been better; I had just bfolcen up with a man and was seeing a woman, and felt as if this change did not cancel out my leellisgi fbr men, but expand\u00ad ed thero to include women. More significant than Mlchele's column was a small notice she and ancxher bisexual woman placed in a later EC: \"Bisexual women's group Ibrming.\" I carried the ad carefully in ttty wallet for a week before sum- mooing the coun^^ to call. A doacn ofus met at Mlchele's liouse> ner\u00ad vous \u00a3C!\" \"Let's start siq>port tleslgn a k)90 and .ATM year, the Rochester Wbofen's Bisexual Network has acconqrtished this and more. Notie of this is to neglect Micbde's role as editor of thc EC. During her tenure, the papcr has mn strong feature articles and sen\u00ad sitive essays, has nurtured beginning writers like mc, and has provided space for our com\u00ad munity to infonn, explore, argue, reminisce, criticize, recognize, praise and just talk. Writers and editors often have an adver- sarial relationship. Writing for the EC has been a luxury; Michele is such a skilled editor that she makes nonprofessional writers like mc look very good in print. If you can understand this, thank an editor. Thank Michele. Running thc EC is a demanding job. I wonder how long thc new editor \u2014 bless her \u2014 can work 50-hour weeks and get paid for 20 hours, and how long the Gay Alliance will expect this superhuman effon and be surprised when an editor bums out in two years or less. If nothing changes, the Alliance will continue to cannibalize the best and brightest of our community. Manin and Michele have served the Gay Alliance brilliantly, and I know they will re\u00ad main active elsewhere in the community. But if the Alliance would rather be a social ser\u00ad vice organization than an activist one, the least it can do is provide social services to its activists by supponing and nunuring them, and not impeding their orbits. future was before me. I did not consider pro\u00ad claiming innocence. My ever-present con\u00ad cem was that my mother remain uninform\u00ad ed. I was asking a lot more than thc coun psychologist could deliver, but he listened and two weeks later, in mid-July, my case was dismissed. No fine, no record, no Eleanore Parker clawing bars in Caged^ Free. I did not leave unscathed. On tny day in coun, an old fat queen idling the moming away watchcC ihc procectlin^^.

There would be no haven in my own society. Tb this day the injustice weighs on mc, although I suspect no one else con\u00ad cerned gave it a second thought. For the remainder of thc summer I was sullen in my teacher's basement, but joined her for drinks in the evening. What I remember about August is that I spent ail my savings on new clothes, including a singular\u00ad iy dreadful black vinyl jacket. 1 wanted a new look for college in the fall. Years later when I lived in New York City and the rhythm of that life astonished me, I joked to a chum that it was the only city in thc world where you could trick until you were simple-minded even if your mother didn't let you cross the street. A clever line, ever my stock in trade, and we laughed and discussed the men who had made eye con\u00ad tact that day, and if, that evening, we'd go to uptown bars for a change. 1 believe that by acknowledging the past and somehow Anding value in it, perhaps I can find value in myself. It isn't easy. Had I known how rocky my road would remain for a long time, 1 would have sat down on the curb and refused to budge an inch. But I didn't know. cr,-^mmSmrfg^ 14 THE EMPTY CUOSET JULY graced Paris's skyUne, it was daring and controversial. But its soaring figu re would be no more uninhibited than the Hfe of another French institution whose centennial, like that of the tower, is celebrated this year. He was Jean Cocteau, one of the most multi-faceted of gay geniuses. But he thought of himself only as a poet, and in that con\u00ad text viewed his work as author of operas, playwright, novelist, filmmaker, non-fiction writer, world ttavcler and creator of ballets. His talents were also used in designing stage sets and costumes and stained-glass win\u00ad dows, and making posters, jewelry, tapestries, mosaics, sculptures, pottery, pain\u00ad tings and sketches. Cocteau was bom into an an-loving fami\u00ad ly on July 5, 1889, in Maisons-Laffitte, near Paris. His father was a stockbroker who lik\u00ad ed to paint in oils. His grandfather collected an. When Jean was eight his father shot himself and for the next six years Jean's rich mother pampered him. Maternal figures vv^uld be important in his writing. He was a bad student. Restlessness led to his first taste of freedom at 15 when he ran away to Marseilles. He lived there for a year in a district known for its bars, male brothels and drugs, an area he called his \"real school.\" Thc experience later provided material for a short story about a young Arab man and pan of Cocteau's anonymous book about being gay. The White Book. Shonly after being taken back home he met his first guiding star, who would help launch his literary career. At 16, after quit\u00ad ting school and staning to write poetry, Cocteau met the pederast actor Edouard de Max. The flamboyant, 40-ish dc Max arranged for some of the city's leading performers to read Cocteau s poems in a theater in 1908. Cocteau co-founded a literary magazine that lasted for three years, and in 1909 wrote his first book of verse. He quickly became popular in thc aristocratic salons, or literary gatherings. Part of his charm -was a talent fbr \u2014 combined with a penchant for self-advenising. Author and critic Andre Gide was not im\u00ad pressed and later was involved in a long, public dispute with Cocteau. TWenty years older than Cocteau, Gide was the editor of Nouvelle Revue Francaise. When Cocteau's third volume of poems was published in 1912, Gide's journal criticized the tide of the second volume. The Frivolous Prince. Cocteau was attacked for lacking modesty. Resentful of Cocteau's brilliance and youth, Gide later was enraged when he suspected Cocteau of trying to seduce his young lover. That year of Gide's opening salvo was also a decisive one for Cocteau. He had met Sergey Diaghilev, who brought to Paris the Ballet Russes, of which Vaslav Nijinsky was a member. Cocteau fell under the spell of che dancer and the dance, lie expressed his pas\u00ad sion for Nijinsky by writing poetry in his honor that the jealous Diaghilev would use as publicity. Cocteau then wrote a ballet fbr Nijinsky. TTie Blue God. He also began designing ballet posters and doing sketches. But the real change in his life began in 1912 when Diaghilev shouted at him, \"Astound me!\" That order inspired Cocteau to have a more serious attitude toward the ans \u2014 \"moulting,\" as he said, or shedding his im\u00ad age as the \"frivolous\" poet. He wrote another ballet, but it was rejected due to Diaghilev's possessiveness about Nijinsky. Cocteau continued to write and became one of the avant-garde. This movement was the second front for Cocteau in World War I. Unfit for combat, he became an ambulance driver under a false name. This was the basis for his shon story \"Thomas thc Imposter.\" Two avant-gardists collaborated with Cocteau on his ballet Parade (1917). Picasso designed the set and Satie wrote the music for this innovative production. The term sur\u00ad realism was coined to describe it TWo years later. Cocteau fell in love with 15-ycar-old Raymond Radriguet. He en\u00ad couraged Radriguet to write two novels. Radriguet's death in 1923 led lo Cocteau's opium addiction. He underwent treatment several times and wrote about his habit in <Jpiun\\. TVic writer's first ailcmpt at a cure made him re-embrace Catholicism. Religion and freedom co-existing was the idea for his Letter to Jacques Maritain. In the 1920's, Cocteau borrowed from Greek myths for his plays Antigone and Or\u00ad pheus and his oratorio Oetlipus Rex. In 1929 came his monologue play The Human Vbice and his most famous novel, TTie Holy Ter\u00ad rors, about adolescent rebellion. Intimate Relations his biggest stage hit, concerned incest. He ventured into filmmaking with The Blood ofa Poet (1932) whicb featured the drag queen Barbette and unique ^>ecial ef\u00ad fects. Cocteau is also known for his Hlms of the 1940s, Orpheus, his plays Terrors and Relations, The Eternal Retum, Beauty and the Beast and Ruy Bias. These films made a world star of Jean Marais, whom Cocteau had taken as his lover in 1937 after casting him in a play. Marais was 24 years Cocteau's junior. He stayed with Cocteau for 10 years and they paned friends. In 1947 Cocteau met his last love, Edouard Dermit. Barred from adopUr^ him, Cocteau made Dermit his heir. Shonly before, during the German oc\u00ad cupation of Paris in 1940-44, Cocteau was a target of pro'Nazi abuse for his sexuality, some of his plays and his halted of censor\u00ad ship. Once he was beaten, and he and Marais were often harassed, in 1942 Cocteau testified on behalf of thc gay writer Jean Genet, who had been charged with theft. Genet was acquitted but Cocteau was vilified by the press for his defense. But in 1955 his country awarded him an election to the French Academy Cocteau had said one should not refuse such offers but should not deserve them. On oa. 11, 1963, Cocteau's heart failed after he heard that his friend, singer Edith Piaf. had died. Happy Birthday to: Gay activist Air Force Sgt. Leonard Matlovich (1943-1988)* July 6.

In a recent videotape, Dr. John Boswell of the history department at Yale University revealed that the early Christian churches united gay couples in holy matrimony. Around thc founh century A.D., a wave of homophobia swept through the culture of western Europe, leading civilian govern\u00ad ments to repress and outlaw gay marriage by the church. When the churches continued to sanctify gay marriages, the civilian authorities seized couples and bumed them at the stake. Boswell's book on the subject wili be published next year.
