Experts in the field - a majority of them M.D.s and Ph.D.s -gathered last month to participate in the first major confer- ence on complementary therapies in medicine in which presentations were subject to peer review. Co-chaired by C. Everett Koop, former surgeon general of the United States, the three-day conference (The World Congress as well as specific complementary therapies that may be useful in treating AIDS and cancer. The comprehensive conference also took on the challenging issue of integrating mainstream and complementary medicine, the potential economic impact of complementary therapies and the need for regulation of products and claims made about their efficacy. One-third of people in the United States are now seeking complementary therapies, com\u00ad pared to 50 percent in Europe and 80 percent of the world's popula\u00ad tion as a whole, according to Marc Micozzi, executive director of the of Complementary Therapies in Medicine, or WorldMed '96) took place in May in Washington, DC. Nature Medicine spoke with several of the speakers in advance of the confer\u00ad ence. Between six hundred and one thousand mainstream physicians, com\u00ad plementary medicine practitioners and hospital and managed-care professionals were expected to attend the conference, sponsored by Churchill Livingstone, publisher of the popular medical text\u00ad book Gray's Anatomy. College of Physicians of Philadelphia and co-chairman of the conference. The pervasiveness of complementary thera\u00ad pies is an important public health issue, said Micozzi, adding that it demands that the western medical profession be actively involved. Traditionally, main\u00ad stream medicine has not been open to Acupuncture, chiropractic, Chinese traditional medicine, homeopathy, botanical medicine, nutritional medicine and Ayurveda (an ancient Indian ap\u00ad proach to healing) were on the agenda, Washington State, Bastyr University lead natural medicine charge The grow ing number of complementary medicine practitioners is leading to the inevitable questions of regulatory and educational re\u00ad quirements . Current requirements vary widely from state to state , something that one naluropathic physician says is \"the real prob\u00ad lem right now\" in gaining recognition of the validity of his discipline . For example, in some states, sending in a few dollars and attending a weekend retreat is sufficient to obtain the title \"Doctor of Naturopathy,\" or \"N.D.\" However, a few other states have taken major strides towards regulating the growing praclice. Of these, the most notable state is Washington, which not only legally re\u00ad quires insurance companies to pay for such alternative therapies as acupuncture and massage (as of January 1 this year), but also heav\u00ad ily regulates who can practice complementary medicine and the type of education they must have. Interestingly, Washington boasts within its borders Bastyr University, the first regionally accredited naturopathic medical school, located in Seattle. Opened in 1978 as the John Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine, the school was founded to \"train naturopathic physi\u00ad cians with a scientific approach,\" acco rding to Joseph Pizzorno, President and co-founder ot Bastyr University. The University of\u00ad fers several programs, among them a four-year N.D. degree. Pizzorno says that, although the school enco untered difficulties early with the medica l establishme nt of Washington(including the Washington State Medica l Association, WSMA), the last five years have seen a \"fairly nship develop. NATURE MEDICINE, 1996 (A spokesperson for the WSMA declined comment, but did say members would be voting soon on a general statement on complementary medicine .) \"The rea\u00ad son we've made progress is because of the credibility of Quiang Cao, an acupuncturist and faculty member at Bastyr University, applies his art to a patient. the education, research, and clinical service Bastyr provides ,\" says Pizzorno . \"I think they've realized that we're not wild-eyed radicals, but responsible members of the community who think differently about the best [medical] approach to take.\" Bastyr University has also been the recipient of several large re\u00ad search grants, most notably USS840,000 from the National Institutes of Health's Office of Alternative Medicine to compile In\u00ad formation on alternative therapies used by AIDS patients. This January, Lhe King Counly Council (which governs the greater SeaLLle area), also voted to establish a government-subsi\u00ad dized natural medicine clinic, in order to make alternative treatments available to those unable to afford them. Bastyr University will likely be heavily involved. flNTAN R. STEill 619 "}
