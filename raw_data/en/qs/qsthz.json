Yes, they can make you mad and feel crazy! Our hormones fluctuate and take quite a toll on us beginning at puberty and continuing well into our '50s. Starting at 15, I suffered from PMS, extreme moodiness, and heavy bleeding. Then after my first child, my hormones seemed to balance. But after my second, at 30 years old, they started to shift again, and I felt like I was on an emotional roller coaster for years...always struggling to find some balance in my life! I've been wanting to discuss hormones here for a long time. No, I'm not a medical professional, but in all honesty, I feel that Western medicine has failed us in this area! So, I did everything in my power to find ways to heal myself. I also discussed hormonal symptoms and treatments with friends and clients who likewise felt off-kilter. We tried a lot of different modalities! Unfortunately, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. But knowledge is power, so here's your roadmap to keeping your hormones balanced and living your best life in a safe, effective, and holistic way.
