For athletes who choose to use dietary supplements in spite of the risks, USADA recommends they use only Certified Supplements identified in the UFC Prohibited List. Please see UFC.USADA.org/supplements for more information. The UFC Global DRO website provides the permitted or prohibited status of specific ingredients and medications according to the UFC Prohibited List. Make sure to also check your medications with the relevant Athletic Commission(s) or regulatory bod - ies as they may prohibit some medications and methods that are permitted under the UFC Anti-Doing Program, and vice versa. An athlete should not use any prohibited substance or method unless a valid Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) has been issued by USADA, and the TUE is either formally recognized by, or also issued by, the relevant Athletic Commission(s) or regulatory bodies.BE THE VOICE FOR THE RIGHT CHOICE!
