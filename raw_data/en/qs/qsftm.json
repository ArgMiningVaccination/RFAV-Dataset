It's often referred to as \"lockjaw\" because it can cause painful spasms and stiffness in your jaw muscles. Tetanus is a serious infection that can be life-threatening and is easily prevented with vaccination. Any time you get a wound that may become contaminated with soil or environmental contents, you are at risk for tetanus. The disease can lead to serious complications and even death. Tetanus is a medical emergency that requires treatment in a hospital. Most cases occur in people who have not been vaccinated. Signs and Symptoms of Tetanus The first sign of tetanus is spasms of the muscles of the jaw, called trismus or \"lockjaw.\" - Sudden, involuntary muscle tightening (muscle spasms) \u2014 often in the stomach - Painful muscle stiffness all over the body - Trouble swallowing - Jerking or staring (seizures) - Headache - Fever and sweating - Changes in blood pressure and heart rate Causes and Risk Factors of Tetanus Tetanus is different from other vaccine-preventable diseases because it does not spread from person to person. The bacteria that cause the disease are usually found in soil, dust, and manure and enter the body through breaks in the skin. These cuts or puncture wounds can be caused by contaminated objects (for example, cutting your foot on a rusty nail). - Puncture wounds \u2014 including from splinters, body piercings, tattoos, and injection drugs - Gunshot wounds - Compound fractures - Burns - Surgical wounds - Injection drug use - Animal or insect bites - Infected foot ulcers - Dental infections - Infected umbilical stumps in newborns born of inadequately vaccinated mothers How Is Tetanus Diagnosed? Tetanus is diagnosed based on clinical signs and symptoms. Prognosis of Tetanus The prognosis generally depends on incubation period and the time from first symptom to first muscle spasm. In general, if symptoms develop and progress rapidly, the prognosis is worse. Duration of Tetanus Treatment and Medication Options for Tetanus Treatment focuses on managing complications until the effects of the tetanus toxin resolve. A person who has tetanus will be treated in a hospital, usually in the intensive care unit. You may also be given medicines to control muscle spasms and may need treatment to support vital body functions. Prevention of Tetanus Being up to date with your tetanus vaccine is the best tool to prevent tetanus. [whooping cough](/whooping-cough/guide/)(pertussis), and tetanus. All women who become pregnant should receive the tetanus vaccine during the pregnancy (and any following pregnancies). This reduces the risk of neonatal tetanus infection by 94 percent. If you weren't vaccinated against tetanus as a child, you should see your doctor about getting the Tdap vaccine. (Like DTaP, Tdap protects against tetanus, but in adults). Puncture wounds or other deep cuts, animal bites, or particularly dirty wounds put you at increased risk of tetanus infection. Seek medical attention if the wound is deep and dirty, particularly if you're unsure of when you were last vaccinated. Leave unclean wounds open to avoid trapping bacteria in the wound with a bandage. [antibiotic](/antibiotics/guide/), and give you a booster shot of the tetanus toxoid vaccine. If you've previously been vaccinated, your body should quickly make the needed antibodies to protect you against tetanus. If you have a minor wound, these steps will help prevent tetanus: - Control the bleeding. Apply direct pressure to control bleeding. - Keep the wound clean. After the bleeding stops, rinse the wound thoroughly with clean running water. Clean the area around the wound with soap and a washcloth. If something is embedded in a wound, see your doctor. - Use antibiotics. After you clean the wound, apply a thin layer of an antibiotic cream or ointment. These antibiotics won't make the wound heal faster, but they can discourage bacterial growth and infection. - Cover the wound. Exposure to the air might speed healing, but bandages can keep the wound clean and keep harmful bacteria out. Blisters that are draining are vulnerable. Keep them covered until a scab forms. - Change the dressing. Apply a new dressing at least once a day or whenever the dressing becomes wet or dirty to help prevent infection. Complications of Tetanus - Uncontrolled or involuntary tightening of the vocal cords (laryngospasm) - Broken bones (fractures) - Infections acquired by a patient during a hospital visit (nosocomial infections) - Blockage of the main artery of the lung or one of its branches by a blood clot that has travelled from elsewhere in the body through the bloodstream (pulmonary embolism) [Pneumonia](/pneumonia/guide/), which is a lung infection [Breathing difficulty](/breathing-difficulty/guide/), possibly leading to death Research and Statistics: How Common Is Tetanus? Tetanus is uncommon in the United States today.
