Having developed a unique, interdisciplinary approach, I no longer offer routine Primary Care, but rather support those seeking a more holistic perspective. I provide in-depth and individualized care by considering the whole you, in the unique context of your life. I offer nuanced discussions of symptoms, results, and therapeutic strategies with the goal of awakening new insight and empowering my patients to make informed decisions. I may order laboratory tests and explain results in detail, as well as recommend medications, supplements, and lifestyle modifications discerningly. I am most interested in how the nervous system translates life experience into physiology. Exploring how and why our physiologic state changes gives rise to self-knowledge, self-compassion and agency in our health and wellbeing. Originally from Michigan, I spent 16 years in Chicago: 4 years in osteopathic medical school at Midwestern University, 3 years in allopathic Internal Medicine residency at Rush University Medical Center and nearly 10 years working in Primary Care while continuing my medical education in Functional, Integrative, Trauma-Informed and Mind-Body Approaches. Most recently, I enjoyed working at the Raby Institute at Northwestern, a multidisciplinary Integrative Medicine clinic in downtown Chicago. I relocated to the Hudson Valley from Chicago in July 2020, to better align my life and vocation with my desire to live closer to the earth and tending garden and community with my partner Brian.
