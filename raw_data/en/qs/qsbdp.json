Last Updated: 12-Sep-2023 01:08 ET (12-Sep-2023 05:08 GMT/UTC) Researchers at the National Institutes of Health found that living in an area with high levels of particulate air pollution was associated with an increased incidence of breast cancer. The study, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, is one of the largest studies to date looking at the relationship between outdoor air pollution, specifically fine particulate matter, and breast cancer incidence. The research was done by scientists at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), both part of NIH. National Institutes of Health will provide approximately $5.8 million over five years to create an educational hub for computational genomics and data science. The hub will provide new educational and research opportunities for students of diverse backgrounds, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the biomedical sciences. New \"hypervirulent\" strains of the bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae have emerged in healthy people in community settings, prompting a National Institutes of Health research group to investigate how the human immune system defends against infection. After exposing the strains to components of the human immune system in a laboratory \"test tube\" setting, scientists found that some strains were more likely to survive in blood and serum than others, and that neutrophils (white blood cells) are more likely to ingest and kill some strains than others. The study, published in mBio, was led by researchers at NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Most people have engaged in late-night eating at some point \u2014 whether it's with ice cream before bedtime or pizza while studying for an exam. But if you think those late-night indulgences are just an innocent way to curb your pesky, post-dinner hunger pangs, think again. Obstructive sleep apnea affects millions of adults worldwide, including more than 24 million in the United States. However, most cases, "}
