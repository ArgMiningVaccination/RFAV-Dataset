Inspired by his Cherokee grandmother's healing ceremonies, Lewis Mehl-Madrona enlightens readers to \"alternative\" paths to recovery and health. Coyote Medicine isn't about eschewing Western medicine when it's effective, but about finding other answers when medicine fails: for chronic sufferers, patients not responding to medication, or \"terminal\" cases that doctors have given up on. In the story of one doctor's remarkable initiation into alternative ways to spiritual and physical health, Coyote Medicine provides the key to untapped healing methods available today. I found this book to be thought-provoking, but I have a special interest in both medicine and Native American spirituality, so keep this in mind while you read this review. I think that if you do not share these interests, you might find this book either tedious or guilty of stretching the boundaries of common sense. The author is both an M.D. (his degree is from Stanford University, so nothing shabby there) and a practicing shaman, carrying on the healing traditions of his Cherokee grandmother. (And lest you think it was the medical degree that required the most rigorous course of study, the book makes it clear that the author's apprenticeship in the shamanic arts required an equivalent amount of time and effort.) I found most intriguing the author's belief that every disease has both a physical AND a spiritual cause, and that both must be addressed for true healing to occur. Given recent research into the power of the mind/body connection, it seems to me that native views on healing may have something valuable to add to the science of modern medicine. I recommend this book to those interested in alternative medicine and, of course, to those interested in Native American tradition. This book left something to be desired. I was expecting to find unique accounts of American Indian psychotherapy. Mehl-Madrona does describe some rituals he practices with clients (as I remember mostly if not entirely non-Indian), but this isn't really the focus. In fact, it's hard to find the focus. The book winds all over the map, shifting erratically between Indian stories, clinical case descriptions, \"treatment proper,\" and philosophical tangents into quantum physics and the nature of the universe. I'm sure someone could have found an eloquent way to tie all these together into a tight, focused package. Instead it's a tossed salad of alternative healing and quasi-philosophy. I am still very interested in the subject and would be interested to see if he makes another, more concentrated attempt. I'm so grateful for the opportunity to read this book and all of the lessons I took from it. I appreciated Mehl-Madrona's struggle throughout the book between Western medicine and traditional healing and how he came to combine the two. By describing his own personal trials, he assisted me in figuring out some of my own personal issues like where do I fit in and how do I best help those around me. This is a book about how the author tried over and over again to integrate ancient healing methods with modern Western medicine. It is amazing that these healing methods can cure patients where Western medicine could not. The author says \"Healing and doctoring are distinct pursuits - healers and doctors inhabit different worlds. I became convinced years ago that the ancient and modern approaches to illness can and should be integrated in a way that offers patients the benefits of both.\" pg 111 - \"I saw that we create our own world...that if we refuse to believe in healing, healing does not exist. If we sing and dance only of molecules and drugs, then molecules determine our fate and drugs will be our only hope. What we believe in is what comes true...what we sing and dance is what will be.\" pg 145 - \"Our research findings were consistent with the shaman's belief that relationships are the key to healing...healing grows out of a change in the patient's relationship to his or her self, or it grows through a relationship with the healer and the spirits the healer calls forth...the relationship is more critical than any drug or surgery.\" I am so fed up with the drug ads on TV, most of which shows wonderful pictures while talking about all the negative side effects. I have had shingles for 4 months and been to several clinics and no one can give me advise or medication that will take the pain away. I don't know how a sweat lodge or being alone in the wilderness can cure a person, but apparently it can. Restoring a balance seems to be the key. I have several other books on shamanic healing and plan to read them all. I really enjoyed this book. It's the third one I read after reading Remapping your mind and Healing the mind through the power of story. All of them are excellent, especially for those wanting to help others heal. This one reminds me of a Hero's Journey with obstacles, villains and helpers. There is so many excellent stories, I was often on the edge of my seat! This book will enlarge your horizons! Lewis is a gifted healer and writer. He is both humble and knowledgable. A quote from his book is \"...all healing is an experimental process...\" It is impossible to really read this book in an engaged fashion and remain unchanged by it. If you're interested in indigenous wisdom, harmony with nature, and healing, you're likely to find this book as fascinating as I did. :) This is Lewis Mehl-Madrona's journey from medical school and internship, where he was plagued by the failures of conventional medicine, to learning and absorbing the wisdom of native healers, and eventually combining the two streams in one to best serve the needs of people suffering in many ways. He shares metaphorical, spiritual stories from a variety of native traditions, often used in healing ceremonies, which are full of wonder! And some of the extraordinary results of his healing work with very ill people brought tears to my eyes. Would that this hybrid was the standard of care for chronic illness! This book is also partly personal memoir. His vulnerability and generosity in sharing his own fears, self-judgments, failures, and ultimately, growth add greatly to the value of this fine work. Everybody should read this book. There are so many thought-provoking lessons to learn from Lewis outside of just those related to medicine and healing. My mother began seeing Lewis after recommendations from midwives in Burlington, Vermont while pregnant with my older sister, and her experiences with him and his book were transformative. 'Coyote Medicine' has been sitting on our bookshelf since 1997, and at 22 years old, I have finally got around to reading it. I have heard my mother mention Lewis and this book off and on throughout my life, and have always been intrigued by this book sitting on our shelf. What took me so long to read it? I don't know. But now that I finally have, I have had my own transformative experience from my personal interpretations of Lewis's powerful stories and messages. I think everyone can get something from this book. Take whatever your soul needs from Lewis's amazing storytelling abilities and powerful messages of hope and healing. I'm positive there is something in 'Coyote Medicine' that will speak to you. I was intrigued with his view of Western Medicine and how little time is taken in getting to know the patient before meds are dispensed. I met this author in Sante Fe in 2002 at a Creativity in Madness seminar. He was very interesting and I enjoyed his presentation. He talked a lot about the sweat lodges. I liked hearing about the way he worked with patients and how he brought Western Medicine and Native American healing together. I love this book. The medical stories may be a little dated, takes place in the 70s and 80s. Although much still applies I'm sure. Medical horror stories. But the spiritual healing stories hold true over time. Made quite an impression on me. If you have a hard time accepting other's spirituality this may not be the book for you. For me it was powerful and reminded me there is always another way, another approach, and to never judge till you experience something yourself. A man who knows first hand the dangers of modern medicine but also knows sometimes it is necessary. But he also has researched alternative ways to heal including using shamans, homeopaths, healers of faiths, etc. When needed both modern medicine and alternative can work together. Eye opener! I highly recommend this book to all professionals in the healthcare field, regardless of your interest in natural or Native American medicine. It is a well-written, insightful, and engaging read that will broaden your definition of the word \"medicine\" and stretch your mind about our (mis)conceptions around healing. In fact, I recommend this book to anyone who has ever engaged in the healthcare system or encountered illness, because even if alternative healthcare does not seem to be for you, how you think about and experience illness within mainstream medicine could change substantially with a different perspective. I have a lot of respect for the author. He is a coyote himself, a half-breed in other terms, and he has worked his whole life through developing medical treatment based on both allopathic medicine and indigenous shamanistic practices. This is a man of great courage and determination; if you are at all interested in integrated medicine, you will find this a very exciting read. It took me a long time to read this book not because it was bad, but because it had a lot of thought-provoking content. It may not be a gripping tale or one cliff hanger after the other, but it does leave you with a new perspective that I, for one, am happy to have. Fascinating book--a hero's journey through Western allopathic and Native American medicine by a young medical student who rediscovers his Native American healing roots. There is much wisdom in this book. This book was not what I expected, but I think what it was is more useful than what I wanted. I've known many people that have had their medical issues shallowly explored, more often than not yielding unsustainable results. Mehl-Madrona's holistic exploration of medicine, with a heavy emphasis on spirituality, was surprisingly compelling to me. Only in small moments throughout my life have I considered my beliefs to be even adjacent to spirituality, but the narrative constructed in this book makes an unexpectedly strong case for some sort of spiritual reality, especially as it relates to the mind and body. The author brings an open mindedness that runs independent of specific faith, and manages to create one of the most human explorations of medicine I have ever read. I cannot recommend this read enough. An interesting look at Native healing practices vs. western medicine. Having one foot in each worldview, Mehl-Madrona is able to represent both perspectives. He suggests that these healing methods can - and should - offer complementary approaches. At the same time, Mehl-Madrona presents the stark challenge of introducing Native healing into the western medical system. Mehl-Madrona incorporates native story-telling as he relates his journey of apprenticeship under the tutelage of different Native shamans and healers. This is also a story of one doctor's effort to resolve conscience and calling with an impersonal healing system that lacks \"spirit.\" I recommend for anyone interested in the intersection between Native healing practices and western science. From the view of medical practitioner, this non-fiction story details the difficulties doctors have while interns and in practice. Shocking details of malpractice that were not only accepted by the heads of staff, but enforced is outlined in this memoir. Included as well are Lewis's own short-comings, which he chose to learn from, rather than disguise, his incorporation of shamanic healing and the hypnotic healing of story-telling. Understanding the difficulties doctors face is important to understanding why so many doctors seem to not be empathetic enough to their patients. Great reading and a really good story. This book was amazing. You get to see the author's attempts to combine western and eastern medicine and how challenging it is to truly heal within the constraints of some institutions. Some of the stories about what happens between doctors while caring for their patients was shocking. I was fascinated by his stories about learning the Native American healing practices and how it affected his ability to care for his patients inside and outside of the establishment. It also touched me on a personal level as well and I found it to be inspiring and hopeful. \"Before you can become a healer, you must make friends with chaos.\" This quote comes from this book, and it has been the quote that I turn to as I study Traditional Chinese Medicine, experiencing all manner of twists, turns, and bumps. Madrona writes about his journey honestly and openly, and he does not make himself out to be a saint or someone \"blessed\" with extraordinary powers - he heard his calling and he followed it - he encourages the reader to do the same, no matter what. I found the stories related by Lewis Mehl-Madrona very interesting. I have had some negative experiences with allopathic medicine but after reading this book...I am more determined than ever to rely on chiropractic and other forms of natural healing! Loved this book. Compelling, insightful and Dr Mehl-Madrona can write. Clear, conversational style. He paints a picture of us humans as possessing the ability to tap into this rich healing if we have the courage. Ehh.. It was good. I read this at a time when I was really searching for something valid, concrete and lasting in my life and this book only offered more wonderment. However, it left me that much more educated on the subject of the Native and, in this case, the professional Native American "}
