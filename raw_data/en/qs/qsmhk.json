Patients with a wide range of life-threatening and debilitating illnesses today live in the hope tomorrow will bring a new medicine that will improve or even save their life. America's biopharmaceutical research companies are researching and developing new medicines to meet unmet need and continuing research and development even after U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, all with the goal of improving patients' health, quality of life, and saving lives. Since 2000, nearly 900 new medicines have been approved by the FDA, helping patients live longer, healthier lives. Among the remarkable new treatments reaching patients are the first gene therapies for devastating rare genetic disorders impacting infants and children, curative treatments for hepatitis C, a range of CAR-T cell therapies driving unprecedented remission rates for cancer patients as well as immunotherapies and targeted therapies widely regarded as driving accelerated drops in cancer mortality for U.S. patients in recent years. Explore the medicines in development for a wide range of diseases below. Medicines in Development 2023 Report: The Leading Chronic Diseases Impacting Older Americans Today, there are more than 400 medicines in development for leading chronic diseases affecting older Americans. A new report from PhRMA explores the medicines that target these diseases and conditions. Read about the more than 600 medicines and vaccines, treating many of the diseases and conditions of particular concern for women's health, that are currently in development by the America's biopharmaceutical research companies. Read about the more than 700 medicines and vaccines, treating many of the approximately 8,000 known rare diseases, that are currently in development by the America's biopharmaceutical research companies. As the world confronts the COVID-19 public health crisis, now more than ever is the time to consider preparedness for a growing public health threat: antimicrobial resistance (AMR). This means a robust and sustained pipeline of new and novel antimicrobial medicines is critical to ensure that new innovations and interventions can keep pace with these evolving pathogens. Today, more than 1,300 medicines and vaccines for various cancers are currently in development by innovative biopharmaceutical research companies, all of which are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Over the years, vaccines have played a critical role in reducing the spread of, and, in some cases, eliminating the threat of the world's many devastating infectious diseases. Vaccines represent some of the most impactful public health advances seen to date.
