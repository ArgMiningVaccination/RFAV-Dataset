And there are specific female hormones that undergo changes as a part of aging. If you want to prioritize hormonal health in women, start with menopause supplements. Menopause is a normal (but not necessarily welcome) part of the aging process for women. It can come with discomforts like hot flashes and mood swings alongside changes in your menstrual cycle. Estrogen supplements counteract these effects. While most don't actually contain estrogen, nutrients like hops extract, licorice root and Norway spruce support healthy estrogen metabolism and menopause relief. Broccoli extract, dong quai and chasteberry are also good options for optimal hormone metabolism. For menopausal and post-menopausal women looking to support their sex drive, cordyceps and maca root support healthy sexual comfort, function and response. Other options for women's hormone health include inositol (usually as myo-inositol), a mood support supplement that helps maintain healthy hormone levels, soy extract to mimic estrogen-like activity in the body for a healthy heart and brain, and calcium D-glucarate to help clear unwanted hormones and other toxins from the body. Best supplements for men's hormone balance Just like women, men need nutrients that address all the unique needs and challenges they have when it comes to hormone balance. Testosterone (or T) health is essential for a man's mood, body composition and sexual health. And with aging, those T levels can decline. The combination of pomegranate, cacao and luteolin promotes healthy testosterone levels, function and production. A comprehensive formula containing maca root, chrysin, lignan and nettle root extracts and black pepper is another good option for men. Together, these compounds encourage testosterone production and healthy prostate function. Finally, don't overlook minerals like zinc and boron. Zinc is vital for hormone production in men by inhibiting testosterone to estrogen conversion and boron helps promote free testosterone production. Are cruciferous vegetables good for hormone balance? Yes! Cruciferous vegetables\u2014the popular veggies on your dinner plate including broccoli, cauliflower and cabbage\u2014pack a powerful hormone balance punch. They contain specific health-promoting compounds for your cellular and hormone health. Unfortunately, most of those active compounds are lost during cooking and require chewing. And since many people aren't keen on getting leafy greens every day, taking a supplement to make sure you get everything you need might be a good idea. The most popular cruciferous veggie found in supplement form is broccoli extract\u2014and for good reason! It contains specific health-promoting compounds that protect your cells and promote healthy cell division. Formulas that contain watercress, rosemary and cabbage can further augment broccoli's healthy benefits. You should also look for formulas that contain DIM (diindolylmethane). A DIM supplement can help modulate estrogen metabolism and support healthy cell division. Need help selecting what's best for you?
