Dr. Alan Clark Scientific Advisory Board Member The National Autism Association was deeply saddened by the loss of Alan D. Clark, M.D. A member of our scientific advisory board, Alan was respected and admired by all who had the honor of working with him. His love for his family was boundless, as was his compassion for all families affected by neurological disorders resulting from mercury exposure. Although a genteel, soft-spoken man, Alan's words and intellect were powerful. He was a selfless seeker of medical truth, even when that truth might prove unpopular with the medical community in which he served. Alan was one of only a handful of physicians in the entire state of Missouri brave enough to confront the reality that overexposure to mercury through vaccines has led to epidemic numbers of neurologically injured children. Alan's tireless pursuit to educate others about the devastating effects of mercury upon children led him to all parts of the country, where all who met him were struck by his sincerity, kindness, and dedication to helping others.
