If you answer \"yes\" to any question, it does not necessarily mean you should not be vaccinated. It just means additional questions may be asked. If a question is not clear, please ask your healthcare provider to explain it.

For additional information on ACIP general recommendations, see: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/ acip-recs/general-recs/index.html. Two COVID-19 vaccines are currently authorized for use in the United States. These vaccines are authorized for use among different age populations. Anyone outside of the authorized age groups for a product should not receive the vaccine. Are you feeling sick today? There is no evidence that acute illness reduces vaccine efficacy or increases vaccine adverse events. However, as a precaution with moderate or severe acute illness, all vaccines should be delayed until the illness has improved. Mild illnesses (e.g., upper respiratory infections, diarrhea) are NOT contraindications to vaccination. Do not withhold vaccination if a person is taking antibiotics. Vaccination of persons with current SARS-CoV-2 infection should be deferred until the person has recovered from acute illness and they can discontinue isolation. This recommendation applies to persons who develop SARS-CoV-2 infection before receiving any vaccine doses as well as those who develop SARS-CoV-2 infection after the first dose but before receipt of the second dose. Have you ever received a dose of COVID-19 vaccine? COVID-19 vaccines are NOT interchangeable. Currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines require two doses. Both doses of the series should be completed with the same product. Product dosing schedules vary. Check medical records, immunization information systems, and vaccination record cards to help determine the initial product received. Those who received a trial vaccine should consult with the trial sponsors to determine if it is feasible to receive additional doses. The second dose should be administered as close to the recommended interval as possible. The vaccine can be given up to four days in advance of the recommended interval if a patient presents early and you are concerned they will not return at the appropriate interval for vaccination. However, there is no maximum interval between the first and second dose for either vaccine. The series does not need to be restarted.PRODUCT AUTHORIZED AGE GROUPS Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine 16 years of age and older Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine 18 years of age and older PRODUCT DOSING SCHEDULE Between doses 1 and 2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine 21 days Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine 28 days Pre-Vaccination Checklist for COVID-19 Vaccines Information for Healthcare Professionals12/21/20 CS321629-E4 Have you e ver had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to something? For example, a reaction for which you were treated with epinephrine or EpiPen\u00ae, or for which you had to go to the hospital? Allergic reactions, including severe allergic reactions, NOT related to vaccines or injectable therapies (e.g., food, pet, venom, environmental, or latex allergies; oral medications) are NOT a contraindication or precaution to vaccination with currently authorized COVID-19 vaccine. HOWEVER, individuals who have had severe allergic reactions to something, regardless of cause, should be observed for 30 minutes after vaccination. All other persons should be observed for 15 minutes. Was the severe allergic reaction after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine? History of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose or component of the COVID-19 vaccine product being offered is a contraindication to any current COVID-19 vaccine. Ask questions about previous severe reactions that might indicate an allergy to a vaccine component. For example, PEG may have been a component of medication for a colonoscopy. Was the severe allergic reaction after receiving another vaccine or another injectable medication? History of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to another vaccine or a component of another vaccine OR anaphylactic reaction to any other injectable medication is a precaution to currently authorized COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccine may be given, but counsel patients about unknown risks of developing a severe allergic reaction and balance these risks against the benefits of vaccination. These individuals should be observed for 30 minutes after vaccination. A history of mild allergic reaction to a vaccine or injectable therapy is not a precaution to vaccination. Have you received passive antibody therapy as treatment for COVID-19? Based on the estimated half-life of monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma as part of COVID-19 treatment, as well as evidence suggesting that reinfection is uncommon in the 90 days after initial infection, vaccination should be deferred for at least 90 days, as a precautionary measure until additional information becomes available, to avoid interference of the antibody treatment with vaccine-induced immune responses.Description Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine Moderna COVID-19 vaccine viral spike (S) of Dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate Sodium acetate Sucrose SucroseCOVID-19 Vaccine Components Healthcare professionals should be familiar with identifying immediate- type allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, and be competent in treating these events at the time of vaccine administration. Appropriate medical treatment for severe allergic reactions must be immediately available in the event that an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs following administration of a COVID-19 vaccine. See Management of Anaphylaxis at COVID-19 Vaccination Sites | CDC for additional guidance. Pre-Vaccination Checklist for COVID-19 Vaccines Information for Healthcare Professionals12/21/20 CS321629-E5 Clinical Consideration Questions Responses to these questions are not (on their own) contraindications or precautions to vaccination. However, healthcare professionals should be prepared to discuss information and options with patients based on their responses to the following questions. Have you received another vaccine in the last 14 days? COVID-19 vaccine series should be administered alone, with a minimum interval of 14 days before or after administration with other vaccines. This recommendation is based on the lack of data on the safety and efficacy of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines administered simultaneously with other vaccines. Have you had a positive test for COVID-19 or has a doctor ever told you that you had COVID-19? Vaccination should be offered to persons regardless of history of prior symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccination of persons with known current SARS-CoV-2 infection should be deferred until the person has recovered from the acute illness (if the person had symptoms) and criteria have been met for them to discontinue isolation. Persons with documented acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in the preceding 90 days may delay vaccination until near the end of this period, if desired, because current evidence suggests reinfection is uncommon during this time. Viral testing to assess for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection or serologic testing to assess for prior infection solely for the purposes of vaccine decision-making is not recommended. Do you have a weakened immune system caused by something such as HIV infection or cancer or do you take immunosuppressive drugs or therapies? Persons with HIV infection or other immunocompromising conditions, or who take immunosuppressive medications or therapies might be at increased risk for severe COVID-19. mRNA COVID-19 vaccines may be administered to persons with underlying medical conditions who have no contraindications to vaccination. However, they should be counseled about the unknown vaccine safety profile and effectiveness in immunocompromised populations, as well as the potential for reduced immune responses and the need to continue to follow all current guidance to protect themselves against COVID-19, including wearing a mask, social distancing, and washing hands frequently. Do you have a bleeding disorder or are you taking a blood thinner? COVID-19 vaccine may be given to these patients, if a physician familiar with the patient's bleeding risk determines that the vaccine can be administered intramuscularly with reasonable safety. ACIP recommends the following technique for intramuscular vaccination in patients with bleeding disorders or taking blood thinners: a fine-gauge needle (23-gauge or smaller caliber) should be used for the vaccination, followed by firm pressure on the site, without rubbing, for at least 2 minutes. Are you pregnant or breastfeeding? If pregnant people are part of a group that is recommended to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (e.g., healthcare personnel), they may choose to be vaccinated. For pregnant people seeking guidance in making a decision, pregnant people and their healthcare providers should consider the level of COVID-19 community transmission, the patient's personal risk of contracting COVID-19, the risks of COVID-19 to the patient and potential risks to the fetus, the efficacy of the vaccine, the side effects of the vaccine, and the lack of data about the vaccine during pregnancy. A lactating person who is part of a group recommended to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (e.g., healthcare personnel) may choose to be vaccinated. There are no data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in lactating people or the effects of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines on the breastfed infant or milk production/excretion.
