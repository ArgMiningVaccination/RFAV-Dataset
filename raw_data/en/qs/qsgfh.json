Methods: NAMS enlisted clinical and research experts in the field and a reference librarian to identify and review available evidence. Five different electronic search engines were used to cull relevant literature. Using theliterature, experts created a document for final approval by the NAMS Board of Trustees. Results: Nonhormonal management of VMS is an important consideration when hormone therapy is not an option, either because of medical contraindications or a woman's personal choice. Nonhormonal therapies include lifestyle changes, mind-body techniques, dietary management and supplements, prescription therapies, and others. The costs, time, and effort involved as well as adverse effects, lack of long-term studies, and potential interactionswith medications all need to be carefully weighed against potential effectiveness during decision making. Conclusions: Clinicians need to be well informed about the level of evidence available for the wide array of nonhormonal management options currently available to midlife women to help prevent underuse of effectivetherapies or use of inappropriate or ineffective therapies. Recommended: Cognitive-behavioral therapy and, to a lesser extent, clinical hypnosis have been shown to be effective in reducing VMS. Paroxetine salt is the onlynonhormonal medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the management of VMS, although other selective serotonin reuptake/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, gabapentinoids, and clonidine show evidence of efficacy. Recommend with caution: Some therapies that may be beneficial for alleviating VMS are weight loss, mindfulness-based stress reduction, the S-equol derivatives of soy isoflavones, and stellate ganglion block, butadditional studies of these therapies are warranted. Do not recommend at this time: There are negative, insufficient, or inconclusive data suggesting the following should not be recommended as proven therapies for managing VMS:cooling techniques, avoidance of triggers, exercise, yoga, paced respiration, relaxation, over-the-counter supple-ments and herbal therapies, acupuncture, calibration of neural oscillations, and chiropractic interventions.Incorporating the available evidence into clinical practice will help ensure that women receive evidence-based recommendations along with appropriate cautions for appropriate and timely management of VMS. Key Words: Complementary therapies - Hot flashes/diet therapy - Hot flashes/drug therapy - Hot flashes/ prevention and control - Menopause - Post-menopause. INTRODUCTION Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) are the cardinal symp- tom of menopause, affecting more than three-quar-ters of midlife women. Symptoms typically last 5 to 7 years, although some women continue to experiencesymptoms for longer than 10 or 15 years. 1,2Hormone therapy (HT) was previously the mainstay of treatment, but other options are needed because HT may not be the treatment ofchoice because of personal preference or medical contra-indications (eg, hormonally dependent cancers). As a result,surveys suggest that 50% to 80% of midlife women usenonhormonal therapies for VMS. 3-6 Decisions about which nonhormonal options are best can be difficult. Most midlife women indicate that they do not feel fully informed or have concerns about various treatment options.3,7For example, a national survey of 781 midlife women revealed that 75% of them did not feel fully informedCME Received August 5, 2015; revised and accepted August 5, 2015.

Eleven years have passed since NAMS issued its last position statement on t he management of VMS. 8In that intervening time, the National Institutes of Health held astate-of-the-science conference on nonhormonal manage- ment of VMS, and a large amount of new evidence has been published in the form of reviews, meta-analyses, and originalresearch. The current positio n statement updates and expands information on nonhormonal management of VMS that wascontained in the previous NAMS position statement and isintended to provide direction to guide evidence-based use ofnonhormonal management of menopausal VMS. METHODOLOGY For this position statement, a n experienced reference librarian searched five multidisciplinary databases usingappropriate keywords. The types of nonhormonal therapiesincluded in the search were identified from the previousposition statement as well as review articles. (For examples,see reviews by Nedrow and colleagues 9and Nelson and colleagues.10) The databases searc hed were Academic Search Premier, Embase, Family and Society Studies World- wide, PsychInfo, and PubMed. These databases were ident-ified for searching on the basis of their medical,psychological, and sociologi cal content, which were all pertinent to the subject. The s earches were split into three sections to differentiate the res ults for easier review: phar- maceuticals, supple ments, and nonprescription nonsup- plemental therapies. After searching each treatment type, 2,919 results were returned from all five database s. After removing articles not in English, duplicate articles a cross databases, and consumer publications, 1,428 citations remained. Articles including men, hormonal therapy, or nar rative reviews were elimi- nated. Further review by the position statement panel dis-tilled the results for review to 340 original research articlesand 105 systematic reviews. Of these, 83% of the research articles and 88% of the systema tic reviews were published between 2005 and 2015, or after the previous NAMS positionstatement was published, illustrating the growth in the liter-ature that needed to be incorporated into this new positionstatement. Individual panel members reviewed the evidence on the different therapies for which they had special expertise andmade treatment recommendations. Members evaluated the evidence for various nonhormonal therapies with the knowl- edge that nonhormonal VMS trials have a placeboimprovement rate of 20% to 60%, with more anxious women showing higher response to placebo. 11 Levels of evidence were assigned on the basis of the following categories: Level I \u2014high-quality randomized trials; systematic reviews of level I studies. Level II \u2014 lesser-quality randomized, controlled trials (RCTs), system- atic reviews of level II studies, or level I studies with inconsistent results. We included trials using poorly validatedmeasures (eg, Kupperman Index) in this category. Level III \u2014 uncontrolled trials, case-control studies, systematic reviews oflevel III studies. Level IV \u2014case series, case-control studies. Level V \u2014expert opinion. Citations refer primarily to RCTs and higher-quality reviews (eg, meta-analyses, Cochranereviews), with no attempts made to cite all available reviews. NONPRESCRIPTION THERAPIES Lifestyle changes Cooling techniques Because hot flashes can be triggered by small core body temperature elevations, 12-14it is rational to propose lifestyle practices that lower core body temperature or that prevent itfrom rising to decrease VMS frequency. These include clothing adjustments (such as dressing in layers; wearing sleeveless blouses, natural fiber clothing that breathes, and light cottonnight clothes; and avoiding pullover sweaters/tops and scarves)and environmental controls (keeping a hand fan, electric fan, orice water nearby; putting a cold pack under the pillow andturning the pillow when feeling warm; using dual controlelectric blankets or a bed fan \u2014a simple device that blows air under the top sheet; and lowering the room temperature). However, no clinical trial evidence supports the efficacy of cooling interventions as treatments for VMS. Level V evidence Avoiding triggers It is also often recommended that women avoid ''triggers'' such as alcohol, spicy foods, and hot foods or liquids. Noclinical trials have studied the effect of presumed triggers, andthe Melbourne Women's Midlife Health Project found no significant association between alcohol intake and VMS. 15 Level V evidence Exercise The hypothesis that regular aerobic exercise might be associ- ated with a reduction in VMS arose from observational studiesthat found that women who exercise regularly report havingfewer VMS. 16-18However, others have found no relationship between level of physical activity or exercise and VMS,19and exercise may trigger VMS in symptomatic women.13 The numerous RCTs of the effects of exercise on VMS have been summarized in several Cochrane reviews.20-22The first review20included one study,23the second review21included five third review22added two studies.29,30 Across all three Cochrane reports, the authors concluded that the evidence was insufficient to determine whether exercise is an effective treatment for menopausal symptoms, and the overall evidence was viewed as poor. Methods andNAMS POSITION STATEMENT 2 Menopause, Vol. 22, No. 11, 2015 /C2232015 The North American Menopause Society Copyright /C2232015 The North American Menopause Society. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.MENO-D-15-00241; Total nos of Pages: 20; MENO-D-15-00241 exercise interventions varied widely across studies, for example: structured supervised walking versus yoga versusno intervention 26; supervised prescribed aerobic exercise versus yoga versus usual activity plus omega-3 or placebopills in a 1:1 ratio with each group 30; thrice weekly supervised aerobic exercise class versus hormone therapy23; and unsu- pervised aerobic training four times weekly versus controls plus lectures once or twice per month on physical activity andgeneral health in both groups. 29When three studies that compared exercise to no exercise were pooled, exercisehad no effect on VMS frequency. 22No difference was found between yoga and exercise in the two studies that made thiscomparison. In the study comparing exercise and HT, HT wasfar more effective than exercise in reducing VMS. In a randomized trial published subsequent to the Cochrane reviews, 261 women were randomized to: 1) one-on-oneconsultation with a physical activity facilitator; 2) the samecounseling plus a digital video disc, a booklet, and five studyleaflets; or 3) a control group. 31Women were followed for 6 months. The exercise goal was 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise 3 to 5 days per week. Neither interventionhad an effect on total VMS frequency or night sweats that was greater than control. Although there are many health benefits for recommending that midlife women exercise, randomized trials to date do notsupport any benefit of physical activity for VMS. Level I evidence Yoga Randomized trials to date do not support the case that regular yoga practice will reduce VMS. 32,33A systematic review and meta-analysis of five RCTs25,26,34-36found no evidence that yoga was an effective intervention for VMS ormenopausal symptoms. 32Yoga varied from Iyengar yoga, to traditional Indian yoga, an ''integrated'' approach to yoga,and a combination of Yogasana and Tibetan yoga; someincluded only poses, whereas others included poses, breath-ing, and meditation. Doses varied from 1 to 2 hours persession, 1 to 5 sessions per week, and 8 to 12 weeks. Comparison groups included no treatment, exercise, or both. Two trials 37,38published after the systematic review also found no effect of yoga on VMS. Newton and colleagues37 conducted an RCT in perimenopausal and postmenopausalwomen with at least two VMS per day randomized to yoga(n\u00bc107), exercise (n \u00bc106), or usual activity (n \u00bc142). The yoga intervention used 12 weekly 90-minute yoga classeswith daily home practice. There was no significant difference between groups in change in VMS frequency from baseline to 6 and to 12 weeks. Avis and colleagues 38randomized 54 late perimenopausal and postmenopausal women aged 45 to 58years with at least four VMS per day to one of three groups:yoga (n \u00bc18), health and wellness education (n \u00bc19, atten- tion control group), or a wait-list control group (n \u00bc19). Yoga and education consisted of weekly 90-minute classes for 10weeks, and yoga included recommended home practice. VMS frequency declined similarly in all groups. At 10 weeks, the mean decrease in VMS per group was 6.5 (66%) in the yogagroup, 5.9 (63%) in the health and wellness group, and 4.2 (36%) in the wait-list control group. Level I evidence Weight loss One RCT suggests weight loss may alleviate VMS. Forty overweight or obese women with at least four VMS per day were randomized to a 6-month behavioral weight loss inter- vention or wait-list control. 39Women randomized to the weight loss intervention lost significantly more weight(-8.86 kg) than women randomized to control ( \u00fe0.23 kg; P<0.0001) and had a significantly greater reduction in questionnaire-reported hot flashes (-63.0 over 2 wk) thanwomen in the control group (-28.0; P\u00bc0.03). Reductions in weight and hot flashes were highly correlated (r \u00bc0.47, P\u00bc0.006). Changes in hot flash severity, bother, the number of physiologically measured hot flashes, and diary-reportedhot flashes did not differ between groups. Additional evidence comes from three studies in which weight loss was studied, but hot flashes were not a primaryoutcome. The first was a 6-month study of weight loss forurinary incontinence that included 154 women who reportedhot flash bother (7.5-kg weight loss in intervention vs 2.0-kg loss in control). 40The intervention was associated with sig- nificantly greater improvement in bothersome hot flashesversus control. Reductions in weight, body mass index, andabdominal circumference were related to significant decreasesin hot-flash bother. The second analysis used data from theWomen's Health Initiative Dietary Modification trial(n\u00bc17,473). 41Baseline presence and severity of hot flashes were identified via questionnaire: 65% of respondents reported no; 25% mild; 8% 2% severe VMS. Compared with control, women randomized to the intensive interventionto promote healthy eating were more likely to lose weight andhave VMS symptoms eliminated at 1 year (odds ratio, 1.14;95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.28). Compared with womenwho maintained their weight, women who lost 10 lb or morewere 23% more likely to eliminate VMS at 1 year, and thosewho lost 10% or more of their baseline body weight were 56% more likely to have this outcome. The third study was the Women's Healthy Eating and Living study, a dietary inter-vention trial for women with breast cancer. 42In a secondary analysis, women were classified as having no/mild symptomsversus moderate/severe symptoms (36% at study entry). At2 years, women who had gained at least 10% of their prediag-nosis weight had a 33% ( P\u00bc0.003) greater risk of reporting moderate/severe VMS than those with stable weight; whereas those who lost at least 10% of their prediagnosis weight had a 28% ( P\u00bc0.118) lower risk of reporting moderate to severe VMS. Taken together, these studies suggest that weight lossmight be associated with a decrease in or the elimination ofVMS. Level II evidence Mind-body techniques Cognitive behavioral therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was effective in reduc- ing VMS problem ratings, but not VMS frequency, in twoNAMS POSITION STATEMENT Menopause, Vol. 22, No. 11, 2015 3 Copyright /C2232015 The North American Menopause Society. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.MENO-D-15-00241; Total nos of Pages: 20; MENO-D-15-00241 randomized, double-blind, controlled trials. MENOS 1 showed efficacy of group CBT compared with usual carein 96 breast cancer survivors, 43and MENOS 2 showed efficacy of self-guided and group CBT compared with usualcare in 140 perimenopausal and postmenopausal womenwithout a history of breast cancer. 44A clinical psychologist administered the group CBT intervention, which involved psycho-education, paced breathing, and cognitive and behav-ioral strategies to manage VMS. Women were trained inrelaxation and paced breathing. Discussion topics includedthe physiology of VMS, stress as a VMS trigger, negativebeliefs about VMS, and sleep hygiene. The usual-care groupreceived information about VMS, advice on treatment optionsand symptom management, and instructions for paced breath- ing and relaxation. In both studies, improvements were maintained at 26 weeks, and more women in the CBT group(65% to 78% across studies) reached a clinically significantthreshold for improvement in VMS problem ratings than inthe usual-care group. The self-guided CBT was identical togroup CBT and included a self-help book completed during a4-week period, two contacts with a clinical psychologist,weekly homework, and a CD for daily practice of relaxation and paced breathing. A follow-up study 45revealed that beliefs about coping and control over VMS and belief about sleep andnight sweats mediated the effect of CBT on VMS problemratings. the group CBT manual 46and the self-guided CBT manual47are available. CBT is an effective treatment for bothersome VMS for both breast cancer survivors and men-opausal women. Level I evidence Mindfulness-based stress reduction Current evidence is limited for mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and hot flashes. MBSR emphasizesacceptance, mindfulness meditation, and yoga as copingmechanisms to handle stress. 48Participants are taught to approach thoughts, feelings, and sensations in a nonreactivemanner. An RCT of MBSR versus wait-list control wasconducted with 110 women who had five or more moderate to severe hot flashes per day. The MBSR intervention was a standardized, widely used, 8-week program involving weekly2.5-hour group classes, at-home practice (45 min /C26 d/wk), and an 8-hour in-person group retreat. After 20 weeks, theMBSR group showed greater reductions in hot flash intensity(21.62% vs 10.50%) and bother (44.56% vs 26.97%) thanwait-list controls, but these differences were not statisticallysignificant. Level II evidence Paced respiration Paced respiration is unlikely to provide any benefit for hot flashes. Paced respiration involves taking six to eight slowdeep breaths per minute while inhaling through the nose andexhaling through the mouth. Paced respiration was shown toreduce hot flashes in small, laboratory-based studies, 49-51but two larger studies did not show it to be more effective than other forms of breathing. In a randomized trial of 208 women, paced respiration was no better than shallow breathing orusual care for reducing hot flash frequency, severity, bother, or interference.52Similarly, in a randomized trial of 92 women, paced breathing practiced once or twice per daywas no better than usual breathing for reducing hot flashscores (frequency /C2severity). 53Level I evidence Relaxation Current evidence is limited and inconsistent on relaxation for hot flashes. A 2014 Cochrane review54and a 2008 systematic review55both concluded that evidence from RCTs of relaxation was insufficient. Not included in either reviewwas a nonblinded randomized trial showing a reduction in hotflash frequency with applied relaxation (n \u00bc33) compared with a wait-list control group (n \u00bc27). 56In all studies, results were inconsistent and quality was poor, primarily because of small sample sizes and lack of an appropriate attention controlgroup. 49,50,56-60Level II evidence Clinical hypnosis Current evidence for clinical hypnosis is limited but suggests it may be a promising strategy for managing hotflashes. Clinical hypnosis is a mind-body therapy that involves a deeply relaxed state and individualized mental imagery and suggestion. It has been widely used to manageother chronic symptoms, such as pain and anxiety. Hypnosishas been studied for the treatment of hot flashes in two trials \u2014 one randomized trial in breast cancer survivors 61and one RCT in women with at least seven hot flashes per day.62In both trials, clinical hypnosis involved 5 weekly in-personsessions of hypnotherapy with at-home self-hypnosis practice. In the study of 60 women with a history of breast cancer, clinical hypnosis was significantly better at reducing hotflashes and improving mood and sleep than no treatment. 61 The more recent trial, the randomized, single-blind, con-trolled clinical trial of 187 postmenopausal women reportingat least 50 hot flashes a week at baseline, evaluated clinicalhypnosis over 12 weeks against an active structured attentioncontrol. 62Participants in the clinical hypnosis arm reported significantly lower hot flash frequency (74% vs 17%) and hot flash scores (frequency x severity, 80% vs 15%) than controls.In addition, physiologically monitored hot flashes werereduced significantly more in the hypnosis group than inthe attention control group (57% vs 10%). Level I evidence Dietary management and supplements Soy foods and soy extracts Soy is the most widely used isoflavone-containing food. Isoflavones are a class of phytochemicals, a broad group ofnonsteroidal compounds of diverse structure that bind toestrogen receptors (ERs) in animals and human beings. Iso-flavones have greater affinity for ER- bthan for ER- aand possess both estrogen-agonist formononetin. Genistein and daidzein are found in high amounts in soybeans and soy products as well as in red clover, kudzu, and groundnutNAMS POSITION STATEMENT 4 Menopause, Vol. 22, No. 11, 2015 /C2232015 The North American Menopause Society Copyright /C2232015 The North American Menopause Society. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.MENO-D-15-00241; Total nos of Pages: 20; MENO-D-15-00241 (Table 1). The relative amounts of isoflavones vary, depend- ing on the portion of the soybean from which the material isobtained. The whole soybean contains about equal amounts ofgenistein and daidzein, with smaller amounts of glycitein. Some soy supplements are made from soy germ, which is higher in daidzein than genistein. Therapeutic efficacy of soysupplementation may vary based on the relative amounts ofgenistein and daidzein. Individual isoflavones, such as gen-istein, may have different therapeutic outcomes when admin-istered alone than when the same amounts are administeredwith all three isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, and glycitein)in the supplement. Although soy protein is low in potential adverse effects, prevalence data for soy protein intolerance are scarce. Com-mon symptoms of use include bloating, flatulence, and loosestools. Soy protein is on the list of primary allergens in theUnited States and Canada. About 30% of North American women have the ability to metabolize daidzein to equol. Equol is a nonsteroidal estrogenthat binds to both estrogen receptors but with a high affinity for ER- b; thus, it is often designated as an ER- bagonist. Equol is produced from daidzein by intestinal bacteria and isthought to be a stable characteristic that is best revealed after asoy challenge of just a few days. Equol has two isomers, S(-)- equol and R(\u00fe)-equol . Only S(-)-equol is detected in the plasma of equol-producing women and thought to have anybiologic activity. By far the most exciting research oppor-tunities in the area of soy isoflavone menopausal health concern the potential benefits of equol and the unanswered issue of whether equol is merely a marker for some beneficialeffect of gut bacteria on steroid metabolism. More researchis needed that compares equol producers with equol non-producers.Efficacy. The literature on soy foods and extracts, including derivatives and metabolites, has been the subject of intensescrutiny through meta-analyses (eg, and a Cochrane Collaboration analysis67\u2014all within the last 2 to 4 years. The most recent randomized, blinded, comparative clinical trials on soy isoflavonoids reviewed in the analyses havefound them to be no more effective than a placebo. Moststudies have been criticized for numerous study designdefects. Other limitations are that manufacturing processes are multiple and largely uncontrolled, with resulting compo- sition and batch-to-batch variation that may differ signifi-cantly, and that any benefits associated with isoflavones mayoccur more slowly and to a lesser extent than those achievedwith traditional medications. In addition, there may be adifference between women who can convert the isoflavonedaidzein to equol \u2014and hence show efficacy of a supple- ment\u2014and nonconverters, who would be unlikely to respond. A deficiency in most studies has been the fact that the study population has not been so defined. A supplement containingnatural S-equol has been developed for women who do nothave the capacity to produce equol, 64,66,67but additional research is needed to determine whether the supplementmay be effective for these women. Level II evidence Over-the-counter supplements and herbal therapies Black cohosh. Black cohosh, Actaea race- mosa L (previously Cimicifugae racemosae ), has been used by Native Americans as a medicinal plant but was not used in traditional folk medicine as a menopause remedy. None- theless, it is the most commonly purchased botanical forTABLE 1.

The active ingredients in black cohosh extract are unknown, and mechanism of action isunclear. At one time it was thought to be estrogenic, with invitro and in vivo assays indicating estrogen-like activity. 68 More recent studies indicate activity similar to selective ERmodulators 69or modulation of serotonergic pathways, as review70analyzed 16 2,027 perimenopausal or postmenopausal women treated with blackcohosh using a median daily dose of 40 mg for a mean durationof 23 weeks. There was no significant difference between blackcohosh and placebo in the frequency of hot flashes. Data onsafety were also inconclusive. The authors concluded that, atthis time, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of black cohosh for menopausal symptoms. Level I evidence Black cohosh appears to have no effect on circulating luteinizing hormone follicle-stimulating hormone(FSH), cohosh does not increase endometrialthickness on ultrasound. 71Reports of possible hepatotoxicity started to appear after 2000. After examining all reportedcases, the US Pharmacopeial Convention's Dietary Supple- ments-Botanicals Expert Committee found only 30 reports possibly related to black cohosh. The committee issued adirective that black cohosh products carry a warning state-ment: ''Discontinue use and consult a healthcare practitionerif you have a liver disorder or develop symptoms of livertrouble, such as abdominal pain, dark urine, or jaundice.'' 72 Crinum. Crinums (genus Crinum ) are members of the amaryllis family (Amaryllidaceae) and are widely used in folk medicine in South Asia. Extracts are said to exert antitumor, immune-modulating, analgesic, and antimicrobialeffects. 73The branded product, Crila, is sold for VMS. No studies of Crila can be found in the available medical researchliterature. Level V evidence Dioscorea (wild yam). Dioscorea barbasco ,D mexicana , andD villosa are the varieties most commonly used. D villosa, also known as Mexican yam or wild yam root, contains diosgenin, a steroid precursor used in the manufacture of synthetic steroids. Diosgenin is converted in vitro to pro-gesterone, but there is no biochemical pathway for thisconversion in vivo. Alternative medicine practitioners suggestthat yams have dehydroepiandrosterone-like activity andserve as precursors for the endogenous production of sexhormones, including estrogen and progesterone. When D alata was substituted for other carbohydrates twice daily for 30 days in the diets of 24 Japanese women, they showed significant increases in serum concentrations of estrone (26%)and sex hormone-binding globulin (9.5%) and a near-signifi-cant increase estradiol (27%), unlike 19 women fed plainsweet potatoes. 74The pathway for these hormonal effects may reside in metabolic alterations other than steroidal conversion,perhaps modification of the enterohepatic circulation. Evidence for efficacy of Dioscorea on VMS is limited. One clinical trial employing a yam cream to treat menopausal symptoms reported no significant benefit. 75Yam creams thathave been tested often do not contain any yam extract, and many have been adulterated with undisclosed steroids, includ-ing estrogens, progesterone, and medroxyprogesteroneacetate (MPA). Because of the potential harm that mightresult from adulterants and lack of efficacy data, yam creamsare not recommended for VMS. Level II evidence Dong quai. Dong quai, also known as Angelica sinensis , dang gui, and tang kuei, is the root of the Angelica polymorpha Maxim var sinesis Oliv. It has been used as a female balancing agent in traditional Chinese medicine and as a panacea forgynecologic complaints. Dong quai is reputed to be estrogenic,based on reports of uterine bleeding with use and uterotropiceffects in ovariectomized rats. 76Human studies, however, have not found any evidence of estrogenic activity. Dong quai does not appear to be effective for VMS, and there are a number of safety concerns, including possiblephotosensitization, anticoagulation, and possible carcinoge-nicity. Hirata and colleagues 77enrolled 71 women in an RCT of 4.5 g dong quai per day or placebo. After 24 weeks, therewere no differences in the VMS frequency; Kupperman Indexscores; FSH, LH, and estradiol; vaginal maturationindex; or endometrial thickness. Critics have stated that the dose was much lower than in traditional Chinese medicine formulations and that dong quai is not used alone but rathermust be given in concert with other botanicals to promote thesynergies needed for therapeutic effect. (See the informationon combination botanical products.) Level II evidence Evening primrose. Evening primrose, Oenothera biennis L, is a flowering plant rich in linolenic acid and g-linolenic acid. Evening primrose oil (EPO) is recommended for a wide array of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders including aller- gies, eczema, arthritis, diabetic neuropathy, mastalgia/mas-todynia, and inflammatory or irritable bowel disease. There isa single trial of EPO for menopause in which 56 women wererandomized to EPO 500 mg per day or placebo for 6 months.Only 18 women taking EPO and 17 taking placebo completedthe trial. EPO proved ineffective, with hot flashes declining by1.0 per day with EPO and by 2.6 per day with placebo. 78Level II evidence Flaxseed. Flaxseed or linseed ( lignans, polyphenolic sterols that, when actedon by microbiota in and enter-olactone, both weakly estrogenic sterols. The lignans inflaxseed reside in cell walls and are not bioavailable withoutextensive crushing. Highly milled flax flour and flax meal, butnot flaxseeds, are sources of lignans in the human diet. Flaxseed oil, a good source of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as a-linolenic acid, provides no lignans. Flaxseed meal, flour, and oil are safe as foods. To date, the accumulated evidence for flaxseed does not support its use for VMS. Dew and Williamson 79reviewed flaxseed as a menopausal remedy and found a total of fiverelevant studies consisting of (at least) 437 flax and placebovolunteers, but none reported a benefit for VMS frequency/ severity beyond placebo. Within their review, they mentioned Pruthi and colleagues, 80who enrolled 188 women in aNAMS POSITION STATEMENT 6 Menopause, Vol. 22, No. 11, 2015 /C2232015 The North American Menopause Society Copyright /C2232015 The North American Menopause Society.

Although the mean hotflash severity score change was not significant, 4.9 in theflaxseed group and 3.5 in the placebo group ( P\u00bc0.29), the authors noted a significant improvement in VMS interferencewith leisure activities. LeMay 81reported flax as an effective remedy because it appeared to have comparable efficacy to 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) as a ( P<0.01) for flax and HT, respectively. No placebo arm was included in the study. Level I evidence Ginseng . There are two distinct true ginsengs in common use,Panax ginseng , also known as Asian, Korean, or Chinese red ginseng, and American ginseng ( Panax quinquefolius ), sometimes called senticosus orEleutherococcus senti- cosis ), is not a true ginseng but a member of a closely related family of plants, Araliacea, which also includes sarsaparilla.Some safety issues have been raised, particularly when gin-seng is used in energy drinks with other stimulants. Ginseng does not appear to be effective for VMS. In a study of a specific proprietary product, G115, sold in the United States as Ginsana, 82384 postmenopausal women were randomized to G115 or placebo. After 16 weeks, womentaking G115 showed slightly better overall symptom relief,but changes were not statistically significant ( P<0.1) and accrued only from improvements in depression, well-being,and health scores, not VMS. Ginseng had no effect on FSH,estradiol, endometrial thickness, vaginal maturation index, and vaginal pH. Kim and colleagues measured hot flash frequency with Korean red ginseng versus placebo and foundno statistically significant difference between groups. 83A second study from the same team84found that ginseng improved both Kupperman Index ( P\u00bc0.032) and Menopause Rating Scale scores ( P\u00bc0.035) but failed to specifically affect hot flash scores within either scale ( P\u00bc0.046 and P\u00bc0.121, respectively). These findings were later summar- ized in a review by Kim and colleagues.85Level I evidence Hops. The female flowers of hops ( Humulus lupulus ), also called the seed cones or strobiles, are used in beer, often to adda bitter, tart flavor to other grains. The plant makes aflavonoid, 8-prenylnaringenin, which is said to have greaterestrogenic activity than soy-derived isoflavones. Evidence for hops is limited and inconsistent. There are two trials using hops to treat symptoms of menopause. The first included 67 women randomized to two standardized doses of hops extract (100 mg or 250 mg) or placebo. 86Hops 100 mg was better than placebo at 6 weeks ( P\u00bc0.023) but not at 12 weeks ( P\u00bc0.086). The 250- mg dose offered no therapeutic efficacy over placebo. In the second study,8736 women were randomized to either hops or placebo for 8 weeks and thencrossed over for 8 additional weeks of the alternate treatment.Outcome measures included scores on the Kupperman Index, the Menopause Rating Scale, and a multifactorial visual analog scale at baseline, 8, and 16 weeks. The researchersreported no significant reduction ( P\u00bc0.06) on the Meno- pause Rating Scale after 16 South America, is a cruciferous root grown exclusively in the central PeruvianAndes at 12,000 to 14,000 feet altitude. It is recommended as a tonic and adaptogen, characterized as ''Peruvian ginseng,'' and used for strength and stamina, athletic performance,anemia, and fertility and as an aphrodisiac. The mechanism of action of maca on male and female hormones remains to be elucidated but is postulated to bemodulation of sex steroid-receptor dynamics. Maca contains aweak phytosterol, b-sitosterol, also found in several other botanicals, such as saw palmetto, which is often recom- mended as a treatment for prostate problems. Both methanolic and aqueous extracts of maca exhibit estrogenic activity invitro, but studies have found no in vivo estrogenic effects. In a systematic review, only four maca studies were evaluable. All showed improvements in Greene ClimactericScale or Kupperman Index scores, but all were poor qualitywith poor trial design, very small sample sizes, or limitedreporting of study data. 88Thus, these studies are not strong enough to support the use of maca for VMS. Level II evidence Omega-3 fatty acids. acid a-linolenic acid. Phospholipids, a major component of neuronal cells, contain ahigh prevalence of fatty acids. Two trials have evaluatedomega-3s for VMS. In an 8-week trial of 91 women random-ized to placebo or omega-3 supplement (total daily dose: EPA 1,100 mg \u00feDHA 150 mg), VMS frequency and intensity were significantly improved with omega-3 compared withplacebo. 89In a 12-week trial, women were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to omega-3s (n \u00bc177) or placebo (n \u00bc178) and simultaneously in a 3:3:4 ratio to yoga (n \u00bc107), aerobic exercise (n \u00bc106), or their usual physical activity (n \u00bc142). There were no significant differences in VMS frequency orbother with omega-3s or placebo. The total daily dose of omega-3 was EPA, 1,275 mg; DHA, 300 mg; and other assorted omega-3s, 270 mg. 90Level II evidence Pine bark. Pine bark from the Mediterranean pine ( Pinus pinaster ) serves as a source of proanthocyanidins, the same group of compounds found in grape seeds. Proanthocyanidinsderived from pine bark are promoted as antioxidants and aresold under the registered trademark name Pycnogenol. Three trials evaluated Pycnogenol for menopausal symp- toms, but none included detailed measures of VMS. The first randomized 200 women to 200 mg or placebo, 91with 175 completers and 155 providing complete data. Using theWomen's Health Questionnaire, the researchers reportedsignificant improvements in all scale domains, includingone pertaining to VMS symptoms. In another trial, 38 womengiven 100 mg Pycnogenol daily for 8 weeks showed greaterimprovement in VMS compared with a parallel (nonrandom- ized) group of 32 untreated women. 92Third, 170 perimeno- pausal women were randomized to 30 mg Pycnogenol twiceNAMS POSITION STATEMENT Menopause, Vol. 22, No. 11, 2015 7 Copyright /C2232015 The North American Menopause Society.

These studies suggest Pycnogenol might offer some benefits in relieving symptoms, but data to date are not of sufficient quality to document the degree of therapeutic benefit, and theeffective dose has yet to be determined. Pycnogenol ispossibly safe, but the safety of other pine bark preparationscannot be assured. Level II evidence Pollen extract. A proprietary extract made from flower pollen, Relizen, has been recently introduced in the UnitedStates. This product has been available in the European Union (EU) since 1999 and sold under the brand names Serelys, Femal, and Femalen. Its constituents are pollen cytoplasmicextract (GC Fem) and pistil extract (PI 82), and the proposedmechanism of action is said to be antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. The current product contains 40 mg of GCFem and 120 mg of PI 82. Older formulations sold in the EUalso contained vitamin E. The manufacturer states that thereis no pollen in the product and that it is safe for persons with pollen allergies. In vitro and animal studies found pollen extract does not specifically bind to estrogen receptorsand has no estrogenic activity 94(Prof. Dr. Eduardo Mun oz, Department of Cell Biology, Physiology and Immunology,University of Co \u00b4rdoba, VivaCell Biotechnology GmbH. Unpublished data, 2012). There is only one small RCT of pollen extracts in meno- pause. 95Sixty-four postmenopausal women were random- ized, with data reported for 53 completers. After 3 months and compared with placebo, significant reductions in VMSwere seen on the Menopause Rating Scale (65% vs 38%reporting reductions) and daily diaries (27% greater reductionwith treatment). The Menopause Rating Scale evidencedsignificant improvements in other quality-of-life parametersin the pollen extract group ( P<0.031). More studies are needed. Level II evidence Puerpuria. Pueraria mirifica, also known as kwao krua, is a plant found in northern and northeastern Thailand and Myan-mar. The plant is estimated to contain 8% to 10% isoflavoneby dry weight. Two small studies reported the effects of puerpuria on menopausal symptoms, but neither included specificmeasures of VMS. In one study, 52 hysterectomized, symp-tomatic women were randomized to P mirifica 25 mg or 50 mg per day and followed for 6 months. No placebo was included. On the Greene Climacteric Scale, the baselinescores were 24.19 /C69.11 and 23.19 /C67.89, respectively. After 3 months of treatment, scores were 17.92 /C610.40 for the low dose and 15.35 /C68.44 ( P\u00bc0.332) for the high dose. After 6 months, the scores were 14.08 /C610.30 for the low dose and 12.46 /C66.38 ( P\u00bc0.500) for the high dose. 96No significant adverse effects were seen at either dose. In a second study, 71 women were randomized to 50 mg raw P mirifica or 0.625 mg CEE, with or without 2.5 mg MPA,depending on whether they had an intact uterus.97Data from 60 completers were reported but lacked detail. The research-ers claimed that both treatments performed equally well andthat measures of estradiol, FSH, and LH were also similar inboth the P mirifica and CEE groups. The lack of a placebo arm and poor reporting of data in both studies are limitations. Level II evidence Siberian rhubarb. Siberian rhubarb ( Rheum rhaponticum ) is used as a food and as a medicinal plant for constipation,diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal complaints. It has laxativequalities that are similar to extracts from senna plants. Twohydrostilbenes found in rhubarb, rhapontigenin and desoxy-rhapontigenin, have very weak binding affinity for ER- a, with higher affinity for ER- b. In vitro and in vivo studies support the hypothesis that the hydrostilbenes in rhubarb act as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) with mixedagonist/antagonist activity. 98 A single commercial preparation of rhubarb extract, which has been used Germany for more than 20 years, was intro-duced in the United States and sold as Estrovera. The productcontains a proprietary extract called ''rhaponticin'' or''extract ERr 731.'' One study evaluated this product for menopausal symptoms but did not include detailed measures of VMS. Heger andcolleagues 99randomized 109 symptomatic perimenopausal women to one enteric-coated tablet of ERr 731 (n \u00bc54) or placebo (n \u00bc55) daily for 12 weeks. Only 7 of 55 women randomized to placebo (12.7% retention rate) and 39 of 54women randomized to active treatment completed the trial.Given the small number of completers, the study is probably underpowered. Nonetheless, the researchers reported that at 12 weeks, the Menopause Rating Scale II total score, and eachsymptom within the scale, significantly improved in theactive-treatment group versus placebo ( P<0.0001). The manufacturer has long-term safety data collected from beagle dogs and states that no abnormal hematologic ormetabolic trends have been seen, even at high doses. 100 Human safety data were drawn from a group of 23 women followed up for 48 weeks, 20 of whom completed a 96-week observation period. Few adverse events were reported.101 Additional evidence is needed on both efficacy and safetyfor use in VMS. Level II evidence Combination botanical remedies. Combination botanicals are frequently used by herbal medicine practitioners, most oftensome variation on a multiple botanical formulation recom-mended in traditional Chinese medicine. Combinations are said to offer better outcomes because of the complexity and variety of menopause-related symptoms. Whether this is sound orlogical is open to question because one agent, estrogen, effec-tively mitigates most, if not all, menopausal symptoms. Botanical combinations, although proffering better symp- tom relief, are difficult to assess, given the complexity of theformulations, the potential for adverse events, and the diffi-culty in predicting drug-herb interactions (Table 2). 102-114 (Mary Tagliaferri, MD, Founder, Dr. Tagliaferri Formulas,email communication, 2015) The botanical combinationsNAMS POSITION STATEMENT 8 Menopause, Vol. 22, No. 11, 2015 /C2232015 The North American Menopause Society Copyright /C2232015 The North American Menopause Society.

Most of the trials referenced suffer from thesame types of methodological problems noted above forsingle-agent botanicals. Level II evidence Vitamins. Three trials show varying evidence for vitamin E on VMS. In one crossover trial, 120 women were randomized to 4 weeks of vitamin E (800 IU) followed by placebo or vice versa. 115Although there was a subjective decrease in VMSwith vitamin E, the reduction was only by about one hot flash per day; the authors concluded this was not clinically mean-ingful. However, another crossover trial of 50 postmeno-pausal women comparing 4 weeks of vitamin E (400 IU) followed by placebo or vice versa found a greater reduction in hot flash frequency of about 2 hot flashes per day ( P< 0.0001) and hot flash severity ( P<0.0001) with vitamin E. 116 In a third trial, 115 women were randomized to vitamin E or gabapentin with significantly greater reduction in VMS withgabapentin. Thirty-five percent of the vitamin E groupdropped out because of lack of efficacy. 117Level I evidence Evidence for other vitamin supplements is mixed. A multi- vitamin and mineral supplement was studied in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 99 women, 70 of whomTABLE 2.

At 3 months, there was no significant difference in VMS between groups.118In another study of 46 women, vitamin B9 (folic acid) 5 mg daily for 4 weeks wasfound to reduce VMS significantly more than placebo. 119 Further trials are needed to attempt to replicate these findingsin larger, more diverse samples. Level II evidence PRESCRIPTION THERAPIES A low-dose paroxetine salt (7.5 mg/d) is the only non- hormonal pharmaceutical approved by the US Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) for the treatment of moderate to severemenopausal VMS, with improvements found in VMS fre-quency and severity up to 24 months and improvements insleep disruption without negative effects on libido or weight gain. 120Level I evidence Many selective serotonin inhibitors uptake inhibitors and clonidine, have been tested and haveshown some degree of efficacy in symptomatic menopausalwomen. Onset of action is rapid, usually within 2 weeks.Clinical trials performed for FDA approval are evaluated forsignificance over placebo at 4 weeks and 12 weeks, and persistence is evaluated at 12 to 24 weeks. Level I to II evidence Limited evidence suggests that menopausal HT is more effective than nonhormonal agents in reducing the frequencyand severity of hot flashes. Head-to-head RCTs are limited,with comparisons including varying types, doses, and routes ofadministration with nonhormonal agents. 10,121-124One trial121 reported that 75 mg per day of venlafaxine was as effective asa low-dose oral estradiol 0.5 mg per day. In this RCT, oral estradiol reduced the frequency of hot flashes by 2.3 more per day than placebo ( P<0.001), whereas venlafaxine reduced the frequency of hot flashes by 1.8 more per day than placebo(P\u00bc0.005) However, this trial did not allow dose escalation, in which case estradiol would be expected to provide 77%improvement in hot flashes on average. 125Level II evidence Selective serotonin reuptake review,124and a focused on evidence in cancer survivors129provide evidence that SSRIs and SNRIs are associated with mild to moderate improvements in sympto-matic postmenopausal women, regardless of whether meno-pause is natural or surgical. The reviews are limited byvariability in inclusion criteria, population tested, dosing, length of treatment, and outcomes tested. Those with statisti- cally significant reductions in hot flashes in large, flashes 25% to 69%, with improvements in composite hot flashfrequency and severity from 27% to 61%. Less consistentresults have been seen with sertraline and fluoxetine (statistically insignificant trend toward improvement in hot flashes). 10,130-134Level I to II evidenceContraindications to SSRIs and SNRIs include prior neuro- leptic syndrome, serotonin syndrome (beware of possiblesynergy with other medications), and concurrent use ofmonoamine oxidase inhibitors. Exercise caution for patientswith bipolar disease, uncontrolled seizures, liver or kidneyinsufficiency, uncontrolled hyponatremia or poorly controlled hypertension, concurrent use of other SSRIs or SNRIs, or relevant polymorphisms in cytochrome inhibition of CYP2D6 inhibition of CYP2D6 occurs with so these should be avoided in tamoxifen users.Safer venlafaxine or desvenlafaxine (SNRIs) or escitalopram or citalopram (SSRIs). Black box warnings include uncommon suicidal thoughts within first few months.Possible reported risks include increased risk of bone fracture(mixed reports of bone loss and fracture) 135,136; SNRIs may produce significant nausea or dizziness, which improvesafter 1 to 2 weeks. Suggested dosing for paroxetine salt is 7.5 mg per day; for paroxetine, 10 to 25 mg per day; for escitalopram, 10 to 20 mg per day; for citalopram, 10 to 20 mg perday; for desvenlafax- ine, 100 to 150 mg per day; and for venlafaxine, 37.5 to150 mg per day (Table 3). Gabapentinoids Gabapentin is an FDA-approved antiepileptic drug used for diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia. In multipletrials at 900 mg (300 mg 3 /C2/d), it improved the frequency and severity of VMS. 137,138Adverse events include dizziness, unsteadiness, and drowsiness at week 1 (compared withplacebo), which improves by week 2 and is back to baselineby week 4. Gabapentin extended release at asymmetric dosing of1,800 mg per day was shown to be effective but was notapproved by FDA for VMS. Higher doses of gabapentin (titratedto 2,400 mg/d) were as effective as estrogen (CEE 0.625/d) atreducing hot flash severity scores in a placebo-controlled trial. However, adverse events of gabapentin at this dose included dizziness, headache, and disorientation, so the effectiveness waslimited by these. 123Gabapentin may be a good choice for women with disruptive sleep from VMS because drowsinessis an adverse event. Pregabalin is effective in relieving hotflashes but is less well studied. 139Level I evidence Black box warnings for gabapentin and pregabalin include uncommon suicidal thoughts or behaviors. Adverse events include drowsiness, dizziness, and impaired balance or coordi- nation. Pregabalin may impair memory or concentration. Suggested dosing for gabapentin is 900 mg per day to 2,400 mg per day, and for pregabalin, 150 to 300 mg perday (Table 3). Clonidine Clonidine is a centrally active a-2 adrenergic agonist that has been shown to be modestly more effective than placebo 10 but less effective than SSRIs, SSNRIs, and gabapentin.10,124NAMS POSITION STATEMENT 10 Menopause, Vol. 22, No. 11, 2015 /C2232015 The North American Menopause Society Copyright /C2232015 The North American Menopause Society.

Sudden cessa-tion can lead to significant elevations in blood pressure. Level II evidence OTHER TREATMENTS Acupuncture Acupuncture is a traditional component of Chinese medi- cine in which thin needles are inserted into the skin at keypoints in the body to balance the flow of energy or chi.S h a m acupuncture is a placebo treatment involving needles insertedat unrelated points on the body or use of special needles thatdo not pierce the skin. Drawing on a sizeable body of clinical trials, most system- atic reviews 140,141and a 2013 Cochrane review142conclude that, although acupuncture is superior to no treatment or a wait-list control,143-147acupuncture is not superior to sham acupuncture.148-154A 2015 review and meta-analysis con- cluded that acupuncture is effective in reducing VMS fre-quency and severity as well as in improving quality of life andpsychiatric, somatic, and urogenital aspects of the MenopauseRating Scale. 155However, the 2015 meta-analysis combined trials comparing acupuncture to sham acupuncture with trials comparing acupuncture to wait-list controls and also included a 2014 trial in which the effect size for reduction in VMSfrequency was the largest among all studies comparing acu-puncture to sham control. 114 Most trials comparing acupuncture to sham acupuncture find no significant difference in VMS frequency or severitybetween the two treatments, whereas most trials using a wait-list control find that acupuncture reduces VMS frequency and severity. There is considerable debate about what the appro- priate control group should be in studies of acupuncture.Some 155have suggested that the light touch of the skin during sham acupuncture might induce a ''limbic touch response''that can induce release of beta endorphins, a mechanism thathas been implicated in VMS. 156Generally, however, needlingat acupuncture points does not appear to reduce VMS fre- quency or intensity independently of the superficial touch of asham needle. Acupuncture cannot be recommended for the treatment of VMS. Level I evidence Stellate ganglion block Emerging evidence suggests th at stellate ganglion block- ade (SGB), a widely used anesthesia treatment for pain management, is a promising treatment for VMS, but largertrials are needed. The stellate ganglion is a bilateral neural structure located in the C6-T2 region of the anterior cervicalspine and can be safely blocked via the image-guidedinjection of local anesthetic (eg, bupivacaine) at the C6level. The exact mechanism of action of SGB on VMS isunclear. Adverse events, such as transient seizures or a bleeding complication, occur extremely rarely. 157The adverse events include pain with injection and transientbruising at the injection site. Four uncontrolled, open-labelstudies showed that SGB reduced VMS, with effects rang-i n gf r o ma4 5 %t o9 0 %r e d u c t i o n6w e e k st os e v e r a lm o n t h safter blockade. 158-161There has been one randomized, sham-controlled trial of activ e SGB with bupivacaine a sham procedure involving subcutaneous saline injec- tion in women with natural or surgical (n\u00bc40).162Over a 6-month follow-up, there was no sig- nificant effect of SGB on overall VMS frequency. How-ever, frequency of moderate to very severe subjective VMSand intensity of VMS was significantly reduced amongSGB-treated women compared with the sham-controlgroup. The frequency of physiologic VMS, measured withambulatory skin conductance monitors, was reduced by 21% from baseline to 3 months in the SGB group, whereas the sham-control group showed no reduction. None of thestudy participants experienced adverse events. Findings suggest that SGB might be an effective non- hormonal treatment for moderate to very severe VMS, butlarger studies are needed.

HIRREM is not recommended for treatment for VMS because of the lackof controlled trials. Level III evidence Chiropractic intervention To date, there have been no clinical trials of chiropractic interventions for VMS, and available studies from epidemio- logic survey data show no association between use of such interventions and VMS. 164Chiropractic interventions are not recommended for treatment of VMS. Level III evidence RECOMMENDATIONS These recommendations are based on the evidence reviewed (Table 4). Because most trials were between 8 and 24 weeks' duration, data on long-term use are limited. /C15Considerations when stopping or switching therapies: Evidence from relatively short-term pharmaceutical trials (eg, 8-12 wk) suggests that there is a return of VMS when treatment is stopped. However, there are no available dataon potential effects of withdrawing SSRIs or SNRIs after a period of 2 to 3 years when used for VMS in nondepressed women. Similar evidence is not available from nonphar-macologic, nonhormonal intervention trials. /C15Recommended nonpharmaceuticals: Two mind-body therapies have I evidence showing efficacy inalleviating VMS: cognitive-behavioral therapy accordingto the MENOS 1 and MENOS 2 protocols and clinical hypnosis according to the Elkins protocol. These are relatively risk-free therapies. Women may need educationand help in weighing potential benefits against barriers, such as time commitment and difficulties in finding appro- priately credentialed providers. /C15Recommended pharmaceuticals: low- dose paroxetine salt at 7.5 mg/d and off-label of (SSRIs and SNRIs), gabapentin or prega-balin, and clonidine. - For all therapies, the lowest dose should be tried first and then titrated up as needed to avoid or minimize adverseevents. Onset of action is rapid, usually within 2 weeks. - With titration, these agents are usually well tolerated. Contraindications include hypersensitivity or prioradverse drug reactions. VMS often improve over time, and limited evidence from clinical trials suggests that nonhormonal therapy should be gradually tapered over1 to 2 weeks to avoid drug withdrawal symptoms. - No clear recommendations can be given for efficacy of one nonhormonal prescription therapy over another because there are few head-to-head comparison efficacytrials, and trials have a varying number and severity of hot flashes. - Choice of therapy depends on prior effective and tol- erated therapy, patient history, adverse events profile, coadministered medications or benefit of drowsiness as an adverse effect (gabapentin), coexistence of a mooddisorder, whether hot flashes are more bothersome during day or night, sensitivity to medications, patient tolerance of potential adverse effects, pharmacogenetictesting, and patient preference. - Therapy should be carefully re-evaluated on a regular basis (eg, every 6-12 mo) because data on long-term use are limited.TABLE 4.

Additional studies of these therapies are warranted. - Women are likely to be able to access weight loss programs and mindfulness-based stress reduction pro- grams within their communities. Women may need education and help weighing barriers of time and costin relation to potential benefits. These therapies may not be best for women with severe VMS or those seeking immediate relief. - In postmenopausal women with mildly to moderately distressing hot flashes, the S-equol derivatives of the isoflavones may be a reasonable option, providing thereis no history of soy intolerance or allergy. If a womanresponds to S-equol supplementation, treatment can continue with monitoring for adverse events; if a woman does not respond after 12 weeks, other treatmentoptions should be discussed. Severely distressing hot flashes will be relieved more effectively with prescrip- tion therapies. Shared decision making is valuable inthis setting. - Overall, although benefits were reported from single trials investigating a phytoestrogen extract from therhubarb plant (ERr 731) and an equol supplement(SE5-OH), data were insufficient to permit determination of whether any other type of phytoestrogen product had significant effects on VMS. 67 - Stellate ganglion block may be an option for some women. /C15Do not recommend at this time: Several therapies have level II or lower evidence showing that they are unlikely to be beneficial in alleviating VMS: over-the-counter supple- ments and bark, pollen extract, puerperia, Siberian ginseng, and vitamin supplementation), as well as relaxation, calibration of neural oscillations, andchiropractic intervention. Until additional evidence from well-controlled trials is available, these therapies should not be recommended for VMS. /C15Do not recommend at this time: Some therapies appear risk free but do not have any evidence testing their effects on VMS, and their use may lead to delay in receipt of moreappropriate and efficacious treatment. These include cool-ing techniques and avoidance of ''triggers.'' Research testing these recommendations is warranted. /C15Do not recommend: Several therapies have level I evidence that shows that they are unlikely to alleviate menopausal VMS: exercise, yoga, paced respiration, and acupuncture. Although there are many health benefitsassociated with these, attempts to use these therapies are likely to delay receipt of more appropriate and effective therapies. In symptomatic women, such delays shouldbe avoided given the association of VMS with othersymptoms and overall quality of life. Exercise, yoga, and paced respiration should not be recommended for relief of VMS.The NAMS Position Statement Advisory Panel strongly encourages readers to ensure that printed and electroniceducational materials and websites are updated to be consist-ent with these recommendations.
