(May 2007 ) Office: 1313C Norman Hall (Graduate Assistant Office) & University of Florida's Counseling Center, Peabody Hall Address: Counselor Education Dept 1215 Hall, P.O. By Appointment Classroom: 1313B Norman Hall Topic Overview Spirituality - Spirituality involves one's capacity for creativity, growth, and a sense of purpose in life. It can be demonstrated by personal traits such as wisdom, love, transcendence, hope, connectedness, and compassion. Spirituality is inclusive of, but not limited to, institutional religion. Since the World Health Organization deemed spirituality as a component of health equal to mental and physical wellbeing, spirituality has received increasing attention in the academic realm (e.g., wellness paradigms, alternative medicine, prayer and healing, outdoor/wilderness adventure, and counseling). Spiritual themes have been present in the field of counseling for many decades. Viktor Frankl addressed issues of meaning, the humanists (e.g., Rogers and Maslow) addressed themes of transcendence and connectedness, and transpersonal theorists (e.g., Grof and Wilber) proposed a combination of Eastern and Western perspectives on spirituality. Recen tly, spirituality has appeared as a component of diversity and holistic approaches to wellbeing. Counseling theorists and other mental health professionals recommend attention to the spiritual dimension in order to address the health of the whole person. According to leaders in the area of holistic health, addressing a client's spirituality yields a more enduring outcome than just managing symptoms. The term 'spirituality' carries with it a variety of connotations, some positive and some negative. Consequently, spirituality may bring up concerns of authoritarian approaches to convince people of certain ideas. Nothing in this course, including readings, assignments, and/or discussions of particular topics, is designed to persuade you that one particular religious or spiritual belief system is the 'right' one, or that you should adopt certain values or beliefs. I appreciate your assistance in creating a learning environment that respects differences and values the unique contributions of each person. Mindful Syllabus 2 Mindfulness - Mindfulness has been defined as an ability to attend to the present moment without evaluation or judgment to cloud perception. Mindfulness can be found in western literature on psychology, health, and commu nication, and is described as an ability to approach life and new concepts with flexibility and without preconceptions. Mindfulness can also be found in eastern and Buddhist literature, where it is described as a moment-to-moment awareness of life that frees one of suffering and attachments, allowing for the development of spiritual traits. In this course, we will explore spirituality and creativity in everyday life. Rather than seeking extraordinary, or peak, experiences, we will consider what it means to be mindful of the sacred ness in \"ordinary\" life events. This class has been designed to allow you to reflect upon your journey in life and the role that spirituality and mindfulness play in your optimal wellbeing. Objectives 1. Expand consciousness in daily living by learning about principles of mindfulness. 2. Develop an awareness of how mindfulness can allow one to navigate life's transitions. 3. Gain a sense of spirituality as it fits into holistic well-being, including: a. Personal spirituality by examining synchronicity, creativity, intuition, and mortality (includes experiential creat ivity exercises that may help enhance spiritual and emotional awareness and expression). b. Social levels of spirituality by examining human relationships, expectations, social roles/norms, and fearlessness. c. Global spirituality by considering one's purpose and meaning (in an historical context) and exploring one's unique contribution to the advancement of humanity. Course Texts Kabat-Zinn, J. (1994).

Course Grading Scale 90-100 points = A 80-89 points = B 70 - 79 = C 60 - 69 = D 59 or below = F Course Assignments Spiritual Journals - 20% This assignment requires the development of two separate journals that will be presented to the rest of the class at the end of the semester. a. Affirmation journal (10%)- This is a creative journal filled with images and words that represent the spirituality you would like in your life and the world around you. An affirmation journal is different from a scrapbook of old memories/pictures because it looks 'forward'. You want to seek out images and writings that stretch you just a little beyond where you are now. In this book, affirm what you want in your life that would bring passion, joy, give you energy, and contribute to the world you will leave behind. It is also different than a \"wish\" journal because you are not presenting material things that you want to \"have.\" Emphasize what would bring you serenity and love. Your journal should inspire you when you look at it. You can use poems, fables, inspirational and good will stories, pictures from magazines of nature, words that depict adventure and passion, art, photography, etc. Feel free to use your own work, poetry, painting, etc. Everything should be placed into an 8 x 11 notebook and fill at least 25 pages (One side is one page). b. Career journal (10%)- This is a collection of information from research on the Internet (or other related sources). It will be presented in a separate 8x11 notebook and fill at least 25 pages (front and back is one page for this journal). You will print direct synopses/summa ries Mindful Syllabus 4 off of websites (a page that represents what aspect you liked). One page per website will count. You are strongly encouraged to write in comments, circle ideas on the pages, or briefly describe what intrigued you about a specific website/career, but there will be no formal paper or summary in this journal. The career journal should display all kinds of jobs and social organizations or institutions that relate to your \"dream job.\" Too often, people settle for a \"traditional\" path and go through the motions of pursuing their career on autopilot. Our careers contribute to our identity and our sense of meaning and purpose in the world. People who love their work often say they would do it even if they were not getting paid. And some people even say that they would pay someone else for letting them do their work. See if you can find possibilities that inspire you to feel similarly positive about working. These are not job \"openings.\" Do not search under career search engines. Think of the things you love to do and would love to learn about. Then put them into the web search engine to see variations of how they exist in the world. Imag ine that you are an entrepreneur and you need to research how other people do things. Then you will take your favorite pieces from various places to build the job that you would love. The search will guide you, so you can start out unclear. Just post your favorite findings in the journal, including their descriptions. Go for breadth on this project. Try to incorporate as many different options as possible rather than focusing exclusively on one area. c. Poster/collage summarizing your 'favorite findings' In order to receive full credit for the journals, you will need to present your findings to the class. After all of this searching, what can you conclude about how you will manifest your spirituality in the world? This is what you will discuss in your presentation. These presentations will take place on the last two meet ings. Your presentation should last approximately 15-20 minutes. Please come prepared to describe what your process has been in both of these projects (affirmation and career journals), and how they have influenced your thoughts, feelings and sense of direction about your career possibilities. Please speak to the instructor if you have concerns about this component\u2014it will be a casual roundtable discussion format and need not be a significant source of student stress. Course Texts, Supplemental Readings, and Wee kly Reflection Papers - 20% Because we all learn from each other in this class, it is essential that you complete the assigned readings on schedule and come prepared to participate in the class discussions. Weekly reflection papers are an opportunity to integrate the week's readings, your thoughts on any class material or activities, and any experiences in your own life that seem relevant to your own process of spirituality and mindfulness. Please type and double-space your papers using a 12-point font. I encourage you to be creative with these papers\u2014write them as you might journal for your own development and process, not for mine. As long as you show that you're reading and thinking about the material's relevance to your day-to-day life, you will receive full credit for these papers. Class Discussion, Attendance, and Participation- 20% Each person in the class should come prepared with the reading(s) for the week. The instructor and students will collaboratively facilitate the discussion and questions. You do not need to be an expert on the material nor be able to answer all questions on mindfulness or meditation. Mindful Syllabus 5 Due to the experiential nature of this class, your active and thoughtful participation during group discussion, creat ive writing and meditation exercises is essential for an effective learning experience. The instructor will take roll in each class. Unexcused absences will impact your ability to play a significant role in class discussion, thereby reducing your grade. Per UF policy, the student must provide proper documentation in order for their absence to be excused. Please contact the instructor if you know you are going to miss class. *****You can consider that your weekly presence will earn you a 'C' and it will take contributions beyond this to develop a grade of 'A' for participation.***** In particular, evidence of reading and integrating the assigned books and articles for the course will elevate your score closer to 100%. *Please note that level of disclosure about your personal life is up to you and will not impact your grade. You can share at various levels - thoughts and questions about the books, observations about life events related to class, as well as personal applications and questions related to class. *In order to create a safe and open atmosphere that encourages the exploration of personal spirituality, I ask that CONFIDENTIALITY be kindly respected and observed by all class members. CONFIDENTIALITY means that whatever personal information a student or instructor discloses during class, within the limits applicable by law, should remain within and among us as valued, confidential information. Professional Annotated Bibliography on Spirituality - 10% In order to increase your awareness of the scientific research on spirituality, you will give a brief (1/2 page typed, single-spaced) summary of 5 peer-reviewed articles in an area of your choice. (This means that they should be found in professional journals as opposed to articles in pop magazines or opinions on websites). At least two of these studies must be outcome studies, including either qualitative or quantitative analysis of data; the remaining can be theoretical articles on spirituality that discuss how the term relates to your profession of choice. Basically, you are looking for articles on spirituality that will inform you as a future professional about how to incorporate spirituality into your work. Helpful keywords to help you pull up spirituality-related articles include: Creativity, intuition, death, art/play therapy, nontraditional/alterna tive health, holistic, love, adventure thera py, experiential, eastern, spirit, spirituality, spiritual issues, transcendence, purpose and meaning, homeopathy, ancient wisdom, natural healing. It is important for you to select articles directly distinguishing spirituality from psychology topics. You can almost always find the term directly - even if it takes other words to get at it. It is ideal for you to select articles that are related. For instance, if you are interested in helping professions, you might choose articles about counseling and spirituality. Other topics could be health and spirituality, wellness and spirituality, nursing and spirituality, etc. If you are feeling uncertain about your career path, you can explore several different areas (e.g., law and advertising). Feel free to see me if you are having trouble with a starting point. However, it is best Mindful Syllabus 6 to get an early start. This is a challenging project, and the closer you get to the deadline, the more difficult it will seem. Your \u00bd-page summaries should focus purely on the findings reported about spirituality, and should NOT include personal reactions. Additional Book and Reaction Paper - 10% Mindfulness is addressed in many spiritual traditions and can take many different forms in the literature. In addition to the two course texts, you are required to read a third book of your choice that relates to this class. Some titles are suggested below; you are welcome to choose another book if you wish. However, you must clear any book you choose, whether on the list or not, with the instructor first. Please consider this assignment an opportunity to really look into an area of the class material that interests you personally. The book is hopefully one you would enjoy reading on your own, even if you were not required to. NOTE: A 4-page, typed double-spaced react ion paper summarizing the book's salient points and thoughtfully reflecting on the book's relevance for your own life is required. Spiritual/Religious Experience - 10% Attend a spiritual/religious event, discussion, workshop etc. from a culture different than your own, and write a 4-page reflection paper about it. You MUST get approval from the instructor prior to completing this experience. This does NOT include Center for Spirituality and Health guest speakers. We will discuss this assignment in greater detail the first day of class. Writing your Obituary, Epitaph, and Eulogy, and creating a Soundtrack for your Funeral\u201410% In many wisdom traditions, regular contemplation of our mortality is regarded as one of the most instructive exercises to help us live each moment to fullest, with greater appreciation, sincerity, love, and joy. Regardless of personal beliefs about the afterlife, this exercise is designed to help you reflect on the life you are living now and the life you most want to live before the time of your death. The instructor will also complete this exercise, and afterwards we will share as a class about our experiences completing this assignment. We will also discuss this assignment together in class later in the semester. While you are encouraged to refrain from completing this assignment until closer to the due date, you are also encouraged to begin reflecting on it now. Please see below for an explanation of the individual components of the project: Obituary\u2014An obituary is the short announcement of your death that may appear in the newspaper. Most commonly, it includes your age at the time of death, the people who survive you, and the location of services (if any). It may also include the cause of death, your notable accomplishments, and your occupation. Please reflect on where you'd like to be in the process of your life when you die, and write a realistic obituary. Epitaph\u2014An epitaph is the pithy statement that is inscribed on your tombstone. Consider this the condensation of the essence of your life into a phrase. It may help you to think about how you would like to be remembered, or how you would like to be thought of by a stranger passing your grave. If you do not plan to have a tombstone or gravesite (the instructor falls into this category herself), please still complete this exercise. Mindful Syllabus 7 Eulogy\u2014A eulogy is the longer, more intimate summation of your life and your person that is read by a loved one or a spiritual figure at your funeral/memorial service. This part of the assignment will probably take the most time. Eulogies may be creative, poetic, humorous, and/or heartfelt, but please take the assignment seriously. Think ahead to the time of your death, and consider where you will have lived, what your life's work entailed, with whom were you in significant relationship(s), your likes and interests (particular food, books, art, places, etc.), your religious, spiritual or philosophical beliefs, what brought you joy, what aspects of you brought joy to the people who are mourning you, etc. You may also want to include details such as your financial situation, education, and health. Soundtrack for your funeral\u2014After you have died, imagine that you will leave a CD with music that will be played to the mourners at your funeral or memorial service. What songs would you include on the CD, and why? What kinds of words, images, sounds, and feelings do you wish to convey to the people you will leave behind you, about your life, your love for them, your regrets, your beauty, the fun and joy you've experienced, what you've learned is important, etc.? NOTE: This assignment requires that you turn in a typewritten component listing the songs on your soundtrack (minimum of 8), and a paragraph explaining why you have chosen to include each song. You are encouraged to bring the CD to class to share on the day the assignment is due (and share with the instructor, who would love to hear what you've put together), but due to some students' technological limitations, a hard copy of the CD is not required.
