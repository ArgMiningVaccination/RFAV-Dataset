September 28, 2016 by Lauren Levinson We're going to be honest with you: one of the best perks of being a beauty editor is getting to test out luxe spa and salon treatments. At times, we fly all over the globe just to get the freshest ingredient (such as homegrown lavender from Provence, France) or the most peaceful massage (nothing beats the fresh air in Manchester, VT) and the poshest scene (ahem, Miami). Whether you're planning a spa getaway or just looking for some R & R in your hometown, we've curated the best of the best to bring you our list of must-try worldwide spas and salons. Get ready to book some \"me\" time! The Spa at Augustine, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Prague, Czech Republic Image Source: Courtesy of the Augustine Spa overview: What was once a monastery has been transformed into a gorgeous modern hotel, the Augustine, with nods to its 1284 roots. The enchanted space has an outdoor garden restaurant and a sexy, speakeasy-inspired bar. But downstairs is where you'll find us at the tranquil spa, which features treatments and recipes passed down from the Augustinian monks. In addition to creative services, there are steam rooms, saunas, and a quiet lounge area (we recommend the ginger tea for your drink of choice). Bonus: You can use your Starwood (SPG) points to stay here. 1 / 34 The Spa at Augustine, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Prague, Czech Republic Image Source: Courtesy of the Augustine Recommended treatments: The local inspiration really comes through here, which makes the services exceptionally fun to try. There's the detoxifying St. Thomas Beer Body Ritual (as Prague is a big beer town!) featuring an all-natural \"secret recipe\" from Augustinian monks ($170 for 90 minutes). It includes a full-body exfoliation using finely milled organic beer hops and soothing St. Thomas dark beer combined with salts, done in a hammam room. Hydrating lotion is applied after so you leave with smooth, glowing skin. Then, there's the Couples Chakra Connect, a mind-numbing, holistic massage for two ($153 for an hour). The healing full-body rub is perfect postflight to help calm the nervous system and spiritually awaken you. Three essential oils are strategically used for different purposes: rose (enhances peace and joy), orange blossom (encourages feelings of bliss), and jasmine (stimulates love). Whether you believe in the power of these chakras or not, you'll leave feeling zen. Hot herbs wrapped in cheese cloths act like hot stones, sitting atop of places of stress in the body. Expect to fall asleep during this experience (we did!). There are also facials (an antiaging caviar one is $182 for 90 minutes), manicures ($45 for a 30-minute express service), deep-tissue massages ($124 for an hour), and more. 2 / 34 The Spa at Augustine, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Prague, Czech Republic Image Source: Courtesy of the Augustine Insider tip: Grab lunch or dinner after your treatment at the Augustine Restaurant to eat local Czech food with a modern twist. The delicious food \u2014 including Thursday night barbecues \u2014 comes courtesy of executive chef Marek Fichtner (whom you may remember as a MasterChef judge in 2015). And though the menu changes seasonally, leave room for dessert. When we indulged in a blueberry Summer eclair, it was a highlight of the visit. 3 / 34 St. Regis Aspen Rem\u00e8de Spa Spa overview: There's no cell phone service in this underground oasis, which will help you unwind in the cozy-chic atmosphere. Those dealing with jet lag or mountain sickness can combat both by enjoying a nap in quiet room, adorned with beds, plush blankets, and oxygen masks (it gently blows O2 into your nose to alleviate headaches and dizziness). After your treatment, enjoy a warm cup of coconut tea and dried fruit or sip a crisp glass of Champagne in the coed hot tub with your honey (there's a waterfall wall!). You'll also find hot-and-cold plunge pools and steam rooms in the locker area so you can detox for apr\u00e8s-ski. 4 / 34 St. Regis Aspen Rem\u00e8de Spa Recommended treatments: After a long day of skiing (or partying and shopping!), treat your body to a customized massage ($195 for 60 minutes). In addition to the full-body rub down, the masseuse will massage essential oil into your scalp to promote hair health and revive your feet with hot paraffin wax. It's heavenly! Or go for an Oxygen Facial ($250 for 60 minutes) to infuse your face with vitamins and antioxidants, so you leave the mountain glowing. 5 / 34 St. Regis Aspen Rem\u00e8de Spa Insider tip: Head upstairs into the main hotel to grab a delicious cup of hot chocolate and try the outdoor pools and hot tubs, which are surrounded by breathtaking mountain views. 6 / 34 Spa at SoHo Trump in New York Image Source: Spa at SoHo Trump Spa overview: If you're willing to shell out the big bucks, this downtown Manhattan spot is worth the splurge. First of all, the space is gorgeously decorated in a chic Turkish theme. The two-story venue spills out onto a roof deck with a dipping pool, where you can relax posttreatment with a cocktail. 7 / 34 Spa at SoHo Trump in New York Image Source: Spa at SoHo Trump Recommended treatments: Get a detoxifying full-body scrub in the traditional hammam room ($175-$190 for 45 minutes) that incorporates an oil-based castile soap applied with a handmade Kessa mitt to leave your skin buttery smooth. Then treat your body to a soothing Signature Massage ($180-$195 for 60 minutes), which can be customized in terms of technique; you can also pick an essential-oil scent meant to make you feel calm, restored, or energized. And if you really want to make it a memorable experience, invite your special someone for the Soul to Soul couples massage ($550 for 90 minutes), which begins with a glass of Champagne and a soak in a private infinity hot tub. Book a service here. 8 / 34 Spa at SoHo Trump in New York Image Source: Spa at SoHo Trump Insider tips: Leave extra time after your treatment to enjoy the amenities. Color-changing, 10-jet rain showers and heated toilet seats are so luxurious it's just silly. You can also recline in a cozy bed in the relaxation lounge while sipping tea from Moroccan china. Beverage choices include the Healing Aloe Serenity tea, Calm African Amber tea, and Balance Ginger twist tea, ensuring you leave with a clear head. 9 / 34 Spa at SoHo Trump in New York Image Source: Spa at SoHo Trump The posttreatment lounge at the Spa at SoHo Trump. 10 / 34 Spa at SoHo Trump in New York Image Source: Spa at SoHo Trump The hot tub for the couples massage at the Spa at SoHo Trump. 11 / 34 Spa at SoHo Trump in New York Image Source: Spa at SoHo Trump The sauna in the women's lounge at the Spa at SoHo Trump. 12 / 34 Couvent des Minimes Hotel and Spa in Provence, France Image Source: Couvent des Minimes Hotel and Spa Spa overview: Unless you live in France, Provence may not be the easiest place to travel to, but trust us that it's worth any red-eye journey. Not only will you be in the hub of where L'Occitane and Le Couvent des Minimes products are made, but you'll also have access to the freshest ingredients like lavender, lemon, verbena, and honey. The hotel grounds even house actual lavender fields, for a truly sensual experience. Inside the spa, you'll have access to a stunning indoor pool and a steam room that incorporates essential-oil vapors. 13 / 34 Couvent des Minimes Hotel and Spa in Provence, France Image Source: Couvent des Minimes Hotel and Spa Recommended treatments: Try the signature treatment, a 90-minute hot-and-cold Verbena massage ($192). It kicks off with a hot salt scrub, followed by a deep-tissue massage. It wraps up with a refreshing mist and chilled body gel so you can head out to the pool feeling detoxed. Or take advantage of the abundance of fresh immortelle flowers (a yellow bud known for its antiaging properties), which are included in the Secret of Youth facial ($137 for 60 minutes). The never-fading flower found on the island of Corsica will help give you a firmer visage. Book a service here. 14 / 34 Couvent des Minimes Hotel and Spa in Provence, France Image Source: Couvent des Minimes Hotel and Spa Insider tip: After shopping for the products used in your treatment, grab a glass of Provence Ros\u00e9 at Le Pesquier Bistro, which boasts a terrace overlooking the aforementioned lavender fields. (It's really quite exquisite!) 15 / 34 Lush Spa in New York Image Source: Lush Spa Spa overview: When you walk into this spa located above Lush's Upper East Side store location, you'll feel like you've stumbled into someone's chic English countryside cottage. This is intentional, as the brand was founded in the UK. The relaxation room is meant to look like a Dorset kitchen, where you can drink tea from vintage cups and pots. The sensual experience is enhanced with fresh wildflowers in each treatment room and bespoke oils lining the walls. Treatments are completely transformative as well. UK folk musician Simon Emmerson created custom soundtracks for services, while behavioral therapist Lady Helen Kennedy developed mood-altering treatments that help guests leave feeling better both mentally and physically. 16 / 34 Lush Spa in New York Image Source: Lush Spa Recommended treatments: The spa's signature massage \u2014 Synaesthesia ($175 for 75 minutes) \u2014 may be the most bespoke massage we've ever tested. Before the rub, you'll meet with your therapist to choose the emotional state you want to feel after the service (pick from buzzwords like \"energized\" or \"clarity\"). Then, your massage will be customized in terms of pressure, body zones targeted, colors in the room, soundtrack, and essential oils to help you reach that mood. Or, if you're really feeling the whole British vibe of the spot, try the Hard Days Night massage ($175 for 75 minutes), which is Beatles themed. Start by changing into a pair of warm, clean pajamas, and then your therapist will take you through a series of stretches and massage techniques, which is all choreographed to Beatles music. It is all meant to leave you in a slumber-ready, peaceful state. Book a service here. 17 / 34 Lush Spa in New York Image Source: Lush Spa Insider tip: Love the products used in your treatment? You can buy them at the shop downstairs. 18 / 34 Lush Spa in New York Image Source: Lush Spa Essential oils line the walls of the spa (like magical potions!). They can be mixed and matched to customize your experience. 19 / 34 Equinox Resort and Spa in Manchester, VT Image Source: Equinox Resort and Spa Spa overview: No matter the season, this is one of the coziest retreats you can find. The spa itself is pretty simple with straightforward services, but what makes it special are the attentive, friendly staffers and the gorgeous amenities. Take a yoga class before your treatment or go for a swim in the luxurious indoor pool. After your service, find a nook beside the fireplace to curl up with a hot cup of tea, reside in the outdoor hot tub with your significant other, or take a steam in the locker room. Note that this place is definitely a romantic getaway (can you say babymoon?)! 20 / 34 Equinox Resort and Spa in Manchester, VT Image Source: Equinox Resort and Spa Recommended services: If you went too hard being active at the fitness center, hiking, golfing, or playing tennis at the resort, try the Tension Tamer with Hot Stones ($125 for 50 minutes), a deep-tissue neck, shoulder, and back massage that incorporates heated stones to further relax and heal muscles. Or book a facial featuring locally made Vermont line Tata Harper. The Regenerating Facial ($195 for 75 minutes) features the brand's 100-percent natural products to give you a dewy, apr\u00e8s-ski glow. Book a service here. 21 / 34 Equinox Resort and Spa in Manchester, VT Image Source: Equinox Resort and Spa Insider tips: If you book an early-morning service, you can grab a cup of Vermont Mountain coffee and a homemade apple cider doughnut from the gift shop (for just 50 cents!). If you come in the evening, grab dinner at the Marsh Tavern, and then enjoy a glass of wine by the outdoor fire pit. 22 / 34 The Edition Hotel in Miami Image Source: Nikolas Koenig Spa overview: When you first pull up to this chichi spa, one of the newer five-star destinations on the strip, you'll be transported into a sanctuary free of Miami's bustle. Yes, there's an energy here \u2014 after all, the basement holds a posh club and bowling alley \u2014 but upstairs the minimalist white decor and tea-scented air will make you feel serene. And if you love the signature scent (found in all of the Edition hotels), you can buy it in the form of a candle at the gift shop. The spa is a true oasis, mirroring the clean decor and offering treatments that will perfectly complement a party weekend. The main relaxation room incorporates daybeds housed between drapery and vintage Moroccan rugs. Explore the space deeper to find a hammam, detox room with steam shower, and far-infrared sauna. 23 / 34 The Edition Hotel in Miami Image Source: Nikolas Koenig Recommended treatments: After a night of clubbing or late dining, you'll need to be revived, and we recommend the Build a Massage ($150 for 60 minutes) for just that. You can pick the touch, style, and oil/lotion to make it perfect for your needs. Top it off with the Oxygen and Aromatherapy Inhalation with Power Nap ($35 for 30 minutes), which involves you snuggled under plush blankets connected to a Biotic Wave machine. It sends a light frequency micro charge through your body via earclips, a process that helps the body detox and feel energized (when you awake). Make sure the hangover doesn't show on your skin by booking the Oxygen Infusion Facial ($165 for 60 minutes), during which pressurized oxygen is misted all over your face to brighten, cool, and calm any dehydration. And if all else fails, just get your hair blown out ($75), because the Florida humidity is no joke. Book a service here. 24 / 34 The Edition Hotel in Miami Image Source: Nikolas Koenig Insider tips: Splurge on an ocean-view room if you're staying in the hotel. Nothing makes the mind feel more tranquil than falling asleep to the sound of beach waves. During the day, grab a homemade green juice from the outdoor bar to keep your spa glow going. 25 / 34 Life Time Athletic in Harrison, NY Image Source: Life Time Athletic Spa overview: For the fitness-obsessed spagoer, there's no better place than this Westchester venue. A treatment buys you access to the facilities \u2014 hot yoga, indoor tennis, mountain climbing, multiple pools, gigantic fitness center, basketball courts, and more. But the spa and salon are not to be overshadowed by the rest of the impressive space. After you get sweaty and shower it off, head to the spa to rejuvenate your muscles and get pretty again. 26 / 34 Life Time Athletic in Harrison, NY Image Source: Life Time Athletic Recommended treatments: Chip a nail lifting weights? Try a gel manicure ($40) using CND polishes. Get rid of that ponytail dent with a blowout featuring Kerastase products ($45). And make sure your legs don't feel too sore from all of those squats by investing in a BodyWork therapy massage ($120 for 60 minutes), during which a masseuse focuses on the connective tissue that is crucial to the health and function of your muscles. Book a service here. 27 / 34 Life Time Athletic in Harrison, NY Image Source: Life Time Athletic Insider tip: You could spend the entire day here between working out, laying by the pool, booking a service (or two!) at the spa, eating a healthy meal from the cafe, and even grabbing a drink at the indoor pub. 28 / 34 Spa de La Mer in New York, NY Image Source: Eric Laignel Spa overview: La brand-new Baccarat Hotel and Residencies is a dream come true for fans of both the luxury skin care and crystal accessories brands. You'll feel like you were dropped into Wonderland thanks to stunning crystal decor everywhere from the glassy fitness center to the lamp fixtures. Baccarat gems are also incorporated into services, making it a truly sensual experience. The decor of the spa was inspired by a luxurious European seaside retreat, which plays right into La Mer's oceanic ingredient influences (re: its trademarked Miracle Broth). Plus, the walls of the treatment rooms all feature sea kelp murals, hand painted by New York artists Lynda White and Jeff Wood. 29 / 34 Spa de La Mer in New York, NY Image Source: Eric Laignel Recommended treatments: The La Mer Baccarat Facial is a must try ($350 for 90 minutes) as it incorporates aspects of both brands. Facial massage techniques using two Baccarat signature Victory Stones energize tired skin, while La Mer products are concocted to exfoliate and moisturize the visage. It's perfect for brides-to-be or anyone who is jet-lagged, since it gives you an instant glow, minus any redness. Or go for the La Mer Body Treatment that features a pure diamond powder scrub as well as a hybrid of stretching, shiatsu, acupressure, and Swedish massage ($300 for 90 minutes). 30 / 34 Spa de La Mer in New York, NY Image Source: Eric Laignel Insider tip: The pool area is exquisite. Leave downtime before or after your service to lounge in the poolside beds in this underground oasis. 31 / 34 Spa Castle Premier 57 in New York Image Source: C. Castle Group Spa overview: Spa Castle is a venue to visit with a friend (or lover!). It's easy to spend an entire day at the massive Midtown space, so you're going to want a buddy. Here's the abbreviated overview: the three-floor space includes an indoor rooftop hot tub pool (with a bar!), a Korean BBQ restaurant, a full spa (where you can get massages, facials, etc.), and six themed saunas (including rooms featuring salt, ice, chromotherapy, charcoal, gold, and far infrared heat). There are also more places to bathe and detox in the nude within the men's and women's locker rooms \u2014 though while you're out in the coed spots, you'll need to wear a bathing suit and the provided uniforms (top and shorts). 32 / 34 Spa Castle Premier 57 in New York Image Source: C. Castle Group Recommended treatments: Two words: couples massage ($155 each for 50 minutes). Whether you bring your sister or your husband, this is the spot for a duo treatment. You can choose from a room with one big tub or two individual tubs, where you'll soak postmassage. There is also the option to add on foot reflexology ($75 each for 30 minutes). It's intimate, luxurious, and worth the splurge. 33 / 34 Spa Castle Premier 57 in New York Image Source: C. Castle Group Insider tip: If you don't have the time or cash flow for a treatment, just get a day pass ($65) to use the facilities (includes hydrotherapy bade pools, saunas, and resting lounges). Our advice is to go after work on a weeknight (when it's quiet!) to get some R & R. 34 / 34 Beauty TipsBody CareSkin CareTravelLuxury Beauty "}
