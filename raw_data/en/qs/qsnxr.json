Friends' Health Connection and Origins Natural Resources will co-sponsor the six-city tour, with additional support from Alfred A. Knopf Publishers, Whole Foods Markets, CentraState Medical Center, Ability Magazine, Changing Hands Bookstore, Joseph Beth Booksellers and Transitions Bookplace. Each event will be presented in the form of a town hall meeting, with Dr. Weil interviewed on stage, followed by a question-and-answer session with the audience and a book sale/signing. The series is part of an 18-city tour to promote his new book. During the events, Dr. Weil will discuss the concepts presented in his ground-breaking new work, Healthy Aging. The book outlines the multi-dimensional effects of aging, and the influence of genes, gender, and lifestyle on the aging process. Its topics include: the truth about would-be elixirs of life extension; how denying the fact that we are growing older impairs healthy aging; coping with the many physical, mental and emotional difficulties that become more commonplace later in life; and how to turn aging into an impetus for spiritual development. Dr. Weil will also comment on current medical studies and discuss the most promising areas of future research. The event is designed to be informative, practical, and uplifting. It will draw on Dr. Weil's vast knowledge of both traditional and non-traditional approaches to health and healthy living and will feature the lifestyle strategies of longevity he has observed first-hand in different cultures from around the world. Advance tickets cost $38 and include a complimentary copy of Dr. Weil's new book (which will retail for $28). Each event will begin at 7:00 PM and will be preceded by a health and information fair (6:00-7:00 PM) spotlighting a variety of natural products. More than 1,000 people are expected to attend in each city. For reservations, call 800-483-7436 or register online at www.friendshealthconnection.org.
