Because of this, we saw the need to develop a new primary care practice that engages each and every patient, offers tools and resources that focus on comprehensive health, and transforms the patient experience. [Proactive Health by Carolinas HealthCare System](https://www.atriumhealth.org/medical-services/prevention-wellness/proactive-health) is a fresh approach to primary care. Our team includes a wide array of experts, including physicians, a nurse practitioner, a registered dietitian, registered nurses and health advocates for coaching and support. Each patient works with our team to complete an individualized and comprehensive health assessment to establish health goals that align with six core health pillars: 1. Medical It's important to establish and maintain a relationship with a primary care provider who will partner with you to help you understand your specific medical risks and assess your general state of health. Preventive care is of the utmost importance in staving off health consequences of untreated chronic medical conditions. And effective identification and management of chronic medical conditions is just as important. By getting the right health services and testing, you are not only improving the longevity, but also the quality, of your life. 2. Fitness Regular exercise helps keep your body mass index in a healthy range, decreasing the chance that you will suffer from heart disease or diabetes, while also combating depression, osteoporosis and dementia. Exercise is a key component in the management of high blood pressure, joint and muscle diseases, and relieving stress. Physical activity keeps both the body and mind strong, which is why we begin by assessing your current level of fitness and working with you to set activity goals. 3. Sleep Sleep serves as the main support of the immune system and is absolutely essential for the body and mind to function normally. The average American gets about 6.7 hours of sleep per night, and research would tell us that we need closer to 8 hours. We work with our patients to identify any health problems that may be affected by inadequate sleep and develop specific strategies to alleviate these issues so that they get the most peaceful and restorative sleep possible. 4. Nutrition The average American diet is highly processed, and many of the essential nutrients our bodies need are stripped away during packaging. Fatigue, migraines, insomnia, gastrointestinal disorders and even some cancers are now linked to poor diet. It's important to bring it back to the basics. We can help you develop a new way of eating that not only improves your overall health, but is also fun, easy and delicious. In addition to the advice and guidance they will receive from our licensed nutrition professionals, our patients have access to app-based tracking tools, videos, recipes and more. 5. Mindfulness Mindfulness is defined as the state of being aware and accepting of the present state. Mindfulness-based practices are now recognized to help with chronic conditions, as well as general mental well-being. With the constant demands and stresses of daily life that many people feel, we believe that mindfulness is an important cornerstone of every patient's wellness journey. Our guidance and tools can help our patients achieve more peace and joy in their daily lives. 6. Social Wellness Social wellness is not only important for mental health, but it's well-known that meaningful relationships and support systems are integral to physical health as well. At Proactive Health, we feel that by understanding and supporting our patients' social needs, we can provide a better overall experience. We encourage patients to live with a sense of purpose and belonging while surrounding themselves with a strong circle of family and friends. The Proactive Health Promise: We will provide the high-quality healthcare that you deserve and expect, while partnering with you to help you be your healthiest and happiest self. Whatever goal you are trying to achieve - whether it's losing weight, getting in better shape, improving your overall health or getting a handle on a chronic condition like diabetes - we will be with you all along the way.
